-- " beauty " seemed somehow insufficient a description for the sounds that came from @entity4 's sitar in a concert hall			1
it was as if nature itself were being replicated on the stage , whether it was gentle summer rain or late - autumn wind having its way with the landscape			0
there would be intense engagement between @entity4 and his ensemble as they summoned into being tempests of interlocking phrases that seemed to coil and unravel at will			2
the audience would be enraptured , transported , energized into enthusiastic applause			0
and this was before the actual performance started			0
" if you enjoyed the tuning up that much , i hope you enjoy the music even more , " @entity4 can be heard saying on the recording of the 1971 @entity25 addressing the appreciative , if nonplussed crowd at @entity27			1
it was n't the first , or last time he gently ( at times , not so gently ) reproved audiences who , even with the benefit of his warnings , took the preliminaries for the actual recitals			0
some learned , some never did -- and then there were those who really did enjoy the tuning - up as much as what followed			0
whatever his audience 's reaction , @entity4 , who died tuesday at age 92 after undergoing heart surgery , seemed to accept it all with benign imperiousness and regal warmth			1
as emissary for a classical tradition of @entity54 music , @entity4 was winning over global audiences for that music in greater numbers than could have been imagined when he started learning the music of raga almost 70 years ago			1
he was already close to legendary stature in @entity54 by the 1950s as sitar virtuoso , composer , conductor and director of @entity65 in @entity66			1
he had also written scores for several @entity54 films , notably @entity70 's " @entity69 " ( 1955 - 1959 ) whose international acclaim was a huge factor in increasing @entity4 's worldwide profile			1
by the late 1950s , @entity4 was making cross-genre connections with the likes of violinist @entity76 and jazz saxophonist @entity77 , whose seminal 1961 recording of " @entity79 " was infused with modal inventions that carried the incantatory fervor of classic raga music			1
( @entity77 would name his son @entity87 after @entity4			2
this year , by the way , @entity83 , who like his father plays tenor and soprano saxophone , released his finest album to date , " @entity91 " on @entity90			0
) as all this indicates , @entity4 was already well - known before the @entity93 got involved			1
in fact , they were n't even the first rock group to get hip to @entity4			2
that honor belonged to the @entity99 , who recorded in the same @entity102 studios as @entity4 did for producer @entity103			1
they in turn got @entity106 hooked on raga and @entity106 began plucking the sitar on his own			0
( dial up " @entity114 " from the @entity93 ' 1965 album " @entity110 " and you 'll hear that instrument poking out the theme			0
) @entity106 and @entity4 met the next year and the " quiet @entity93 " went to @entity54 to study sitar with the master			1
back then , whatever the @entity93 were interested in , the rest of the world was interested in , too			0
@entity119 picked up the sitar on the @entity120 ' 1966 hit " @entity121 " and the @entity99 appropriated a sitar - sound ( and a @entity77 riff ) that same year for " @entity124			1
" " raga - rock " lasted just long enough to make the sitar part of the shorthand soundtrack of what 's often derisively labeled " the hippie era			0
" @entity4 was at best ambivalent about such associations			2
but his reputation , as with his music , transcended fashion to become its own singular , lasting presence in the world 's cultural firmament			2
anyone who can make a sound check sound like genius packs substantial weight with the rest of the immortals			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity145 .			0

@entity145 : @entity4 brought classical @entity54 music to a global audience
he says he was legendary in @entity54 when he made cross-genre connections
the @entity99 hip to @entity4 before @entity93 , but sitar could soon be heard on their records
@entity156 : his sound transcended pop associations to carve out singular spot in music
