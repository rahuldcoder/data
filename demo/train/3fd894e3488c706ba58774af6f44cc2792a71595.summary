four days after the @entity1 concluded its investigation into june 's accidental anthrax exposure , more details are being released about the government health agency 's mishandling of potentially dangerous pathogens			1
the @entity1 concluded its investigation into the anthrax incident last week , saying that no lab workers had been infected with the disease			1
but the public health agency 's report also detailed other instances in which lab workers had not followed protocol			1
the @entity17 @entity16 has also been investigating the anthrax incident			2
in a memo prepared for a congressional hearing this week , the @entity16 says it had to track down missing anthrax containers and found the infectious bacteria " stored in unlocked refrigerators in an unregistered hallway " where workers were freely passing through			1
@entity16 inspectors also found that " select agent materials " were transferred using @entity28 bags , which do not meet @entity1 requirements for carrying these materials			1
the problems date to 2011 , according to the @entity16 memo			2
a report from the @entity17 @entity44 " found weaknesses in inventory records and expressed concerns about the lack of biosafety and security training for workers with access to these labs			0
" in march 2014 , a @entity16 inspector again expressed concerns about the @entity1 's bioterrorism lab , including incomplete inventory records for select agents , such as botulinum and anthrax			1
the anthrax incident was discovered june 13			0
the @entity1 report says the potential exposure happened between june 6 and june 13			1
a lab that had been preparing the anthrax samples for use in two other labs on the @entity1 's @entity61 campus " may not have adequately inactivated the samples			1
" that means the other labs were working with samples thought to be harmless ; therefore , workers did n't wear protective equipment they would otherwise have been using when handling such infectious material			0
procedures in two of the three labs may have exposed workers to the anthrax , the @entity1 said			1
hallway and lab areas have since been decontaminated			0
the leader of one of the labs was reassigned shortly after the incident was revealed			0
@entity1 spokesman @entity78 would not confirm the name of the person who was reassigned			2
there are three types of anthrax infection : cutaneous ( through the skin ) , inhalation ( through the lungs ) and gastrointestinal ( through digestion )			0
according to the report , the exposure happened because the lab that was handling the dangerous material initially did n't use an approved sterilization technique			2
it did n't have a written plan reviewed by senior staff to make sure all safety protocols were followed , and there was a limited knowledge of peer - reviewed literature about the process that would make it less dangerous			0
the lab also did not have a standard operating procedure that would make sure the transfer of the material would be safe			0
bottom line , " the scientists failed to follow a scientifically derived and reviewed protocol that would have assured the anthrax was deactivated , " @entity1 director @entity106 said friday			1
it " should have happened , and it did n't			0
" the lab involved in the anthrax incident will remain closed for such dangerous microbes until @entity106 personally approves its reopening under conditions that prevent any such mishap from happening again , @entity106 said			2
the @entity1 has also stopped moving any biological material out of its two highest - level labs while their procedures are being reevaluated			2
as a result of these problems , the @entity1 has created a high - level group of leaders who will work on lab safety issues			1
it has also started putting together an external advisory group to take a closer look at lab safety			2
and the @entity1 is carefully reviewing all the other procedures for labs working with dangerous pathogens , and it has put together a rapid - response command structure to hopefully help the labs avoid future incidents			0
" i will say that i 'm just astonished that this could have happened here , " @entity106 said			0
he stands by his labs , which are considered some of the best in the world , and he stands by his scientists			0
but he added that he is " upset " and " angry " and has lost sleep over the incidents , and he is " working around the clock " to make sure it never happens again			0
@entity1 lab leader reassigned during anthrax investigation			1

@entity16 investigation into anthrax exposure at @entity1 finds other lab safety problems
@entity1 investigation concluded no lab workers were infected with anthrax
the @entity1 director is " upset " and " angry " that it happened
