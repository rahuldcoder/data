producer 's note : when @entity2 started a bike workshop at a community center in @entity5 , he did n't know that much about building or fixing bikes			1
he did , however , know what an important tool a bike can be for a kid with little or no other means of transportation			0
we met him to see how this little experiment turned into a full - time program that has helped hundreds .			0

the program provides inner - city *youth* with the tools to fix and build bikes from the *ground* up
