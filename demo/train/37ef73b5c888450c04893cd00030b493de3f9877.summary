-- @entity1 could not find the energy and inspiration which had seen her defeat sister @entity4 in the last four as she slipped to a straight sets defeat to @entity7 's @entity6 in the final of the @entity9 in @entity10 sunday			1
maybe the effort of three straight three - set matches took its tool , but the seven - time grand slam champion was rarely a factor as she lost 6 - 4 6 - 2 in 81 minutes at the hard court tournament			1

the pair exchanged breaks at the start of the second , but @entity6 broke again in the fifth game and did not drop another to claim her 14th @entity29 career title			2
