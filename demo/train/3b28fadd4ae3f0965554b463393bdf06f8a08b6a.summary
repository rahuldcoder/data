have n't we heard this before ? with president @entity3 weighing possible responses to what the @entity5 calls a major chemical weapons attack in @entity8 , some are warning of another potential open - ended war if @entity5 launches an expected military strike			1
@entity3 's options appear to range from limited missile strikes in @entity8 to continued diplomatic efforts -- what critics contend is a " do - nothing " approach			1
@entity5 officials have concluded the @entity8 government carried out chemical weapons attacks , the president said wednesday			1
" we have looked at all the evidence , and we do not believe the opposition possessed nuclear weapons on -- or chemical weapons of that sort			0
we do not believe that , given the delivery systems , using rockets , that the opposition could have carried out these attacks			2
we have concluded that the @entity8 government in fact carried these out			1
and if that 's so , then there need to be international consequences , " @entity3 told " @entity35			1
" he also said that he has " not made a decision " about whether to conduct a limited military strike or a strike of over a limited time period in @entity8			1
while noted hawks such as @entity43 sen. @entity42 of @entity44 call for a robust response intended to weaken @entity8 president @entity46 and turn the tide of the nation 's civil war , others worry that the inevitable result will be an inextricable mess			1
opinion : for @entity5 , @entity8 is truly a problem from hell " just shooting in some missiles is n't really going to take care of the situation and might aggravate the situation , " @entity56 rep. @entity55 of @entity57 said tuesday			1
" you have @entity8 tied to @entity63			2
you 've got the @entity65 in neighboring @entity66			0
the whole area is already a difficult area			0
you have refugees going into other countries			0
" @entity55 , who sits on the @entity70 , added that " for @entity5 to believe that just by shooting a few cruise missiles , we 've made our statement and away we go , it 's just not the way that i believe this plays out , if that happens			1
" her fellow @entity57 @entity79 , rep. @entity80 of the @entity81 , said the large - scale use of chemical weapons demanded an international response , but he called for a precisely defined mission intended to limit collateral political fallout or open - ended @entity5 involvement			1
" i think the use of chemical weapons is really different , qualitatively different , tragically different , and i think we really have to act here , " @entity80 said			0
@entity3 must " make it clear not only to the @entity5 people but also to the @entity8 people that this is n't going to be the cavalry riding to the rescue to topple " @entity46 , he said			1
at the same time , " this is going to be a punitive , powerful response , a deterrent response to the use of chemical weapons , " @entity80 said			0
" that 's important to make sure that we do n't get entangled in this war , to try and avoid the consequences " cited by @entity55 , he said			0
" but i think properly defined , it can be done			0
and i think it will be done in concert with our international partners			0
" @entity42 said that only a tough response will be effective			2
" if it 's just some strikes with cruise missiles , then it will not only not do any good , it may be counterproductive and help @entity46 with his propaganda , " @entity42 said			2
he called for reversing the advantage held by @entity46 's forces on the battlefield " by taking out his air assets , cratering his runways and getting the weapons to the right people so that they can reverse the momentum			0
" however , @entity125 of the @entity126 said @entity3 risks wading into a protracted war that will become his legacy with hasty military strikes now			2
" by intervening , @entity8 may well prove to be @entity3 's war , bequeathed to a new president in 2016 , " @entity125 , a senior fellow for @entity131 studies , wrote wednesday on @entity133 's website			1
" civilian casualties are inevitable : the images on our screens will not be @entity8 using chemical weapons to kill each other , but @entity5 bombs creating carnage and killings in yet another @entity147 country			1
" @entity8 warns @entity148 amid growing talk of military strike @entity151 : no decision yet @entity151 spokesman @entity153 insisted tuesday that @entity3 continued to weigh options , and he made clear that any @entity5 response to the august 21 use of chemical weapons in suburban @entity158 was not intended to bring " regime change			1
" " we ca n't wait			0
we need to act according to our own national interests , " a senior @entity5 official said wednesday			2
the official echoed the idea that the president has not yet made a decision , but added : " this is moving quickly			0
" meanwhile , efforts by the @entity3 administration to mount international support reaped some benefits			0
major @entity173 partners @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 have called for a tough response in @entity8 , and a @entity173 statement wednesday signaled support for action			1
" those responsible must be held accountable , " the statement said			0
" we consider the use of chemical weapons as a threat to international peace and security			2
" the @entity173 language echoed @entity153 's remarks that sought to justify a military response to what @entity5 officials characterize as the worst chemical weapons attack since former @entity196 strongman @entity195 launched a poison gas attack that killed thousands of @entity198 in 1988			1
" allowing the use of chemical weapons on a significant scale to take place without a response would present a significant challenge to or threat to the @entity5 ' national security , " @entity153 said			1
on the same day @entity3 talked with @entity208 prime minister @entity207 and @entity174 prime minister @entity209 , secretary of defense @entity210 and secretary of state @entity212 consulted allies and indicated potentially imminent action by a coalition likely to include key @entity173 partners and regional powers			1
@entity209 is proposing a @entity219 resolution " condemning the chemical weapons attack by @entity46 and authorizing necessary measures to protect civilians , " but certain opposition by @entity8 ally @entity221 and possibly by @entity222 doomed its chances			1
instead , a limited coalition of @entity173 partners and some @entity230 members appeared more likely to provide political backing for @entity3 to order @entity5 missile strikes			1
an @entity230 spokesman condemned the @entity46 regime on tuesday for the chemical attack			0
in another move , the @entity5 postponed its involvement in talks scheduled for this week in @entity239 on seeking a political solution to the @entity8 civil war			2
@entity221 expressed disappointment at the @entity5 decision and warned against any @entity245 military strike on @entity8 , as did @entity63			1
the @entity5 has already moved warships armed with cruise missiles into the region , and a @entity5 official said wednesday that two @entity251 submarines also were in the eastern @entity252 , though it was unclear whether they would be involved in any military action			1
@entity255 told the @entity256 on tuesday that forces were ready to carry out a strike if ordered			0
a senior @entity260 official told @entity133 that any strike could be completed " within several days			0
" " we are ready to go , like that , " said @entity255 , adding that " the options are there , the @entity260 is ready to carry out those options			0
" opinion : how @entity268 used chemical weapons to poison debate for almost two years , @entity3 has avoided direct military involvement in @entity8 's civil war , only escalating aid to rebel fighters in june after suspected smaller - scale chemical weapons attacks by @entity8 government forces			1
however , last week 's attack obliterated the " red line " @entity3 set just over a year ago against the use of @entity8 's chemical weapons stocks			1
vice president @entity281 made clear that the administration 's view of who was to blame for last week 's event , telling the @entity286 on tuesday that " there is no doubt who is responsible for the heinous use of chemical weapons -- the @entity8 regime			1
" the @entity151 has ruled out sending ground troops to @entity8 or implementing a no - fly zone to blunt @entity46 's aerial superiority over rebels fighting to oust his regime			2
a first step to any @entity5 action will be the public release of a declassified @entity5 intelligence report on the chemical weapons that rebels claim killed 1,300 people			2
@entity153 said the report was expected to come out this week			0
it would set in motion the process that could lead to missile strikes or other responses , depending on the administration 's ability to line up international support and prevent any domestic obstacles			0
legislator : @entity316 ca n't ' be pushed aside ' administration officials will brief some senators on @entity8 via conference calls thursday , several sources said			0
more than 90 members of @entity316 , most of them @entity43 , have signed a letter to the president urging him " to consult and receive authorization " before authorizing any such military action , according to the office of @entity43 rep. @entity327 of @entity328			2
" i appreciate and respect that the president is engaging members of @entity316 , " @entity327 said wednesday in reference to outreach by administration officials to legislative leaders and others			0
" this is good , and i encourage more of it , both on the @entity339 side and the @entity151			0
but it is not in any respect a substitute for formally calling us into session , a joint session , laying the facts before us without disclosing of course sources and methods of intelligence			0
then we , as the representatives of the @entity5 people , can weigh in on this as we should			0
" however , @entity56 rep. @entity353 of @entity354 said that " the historical precedence is no , that the president does n't require congressional action for a variety of different things			2
" some @entity43 senators also noted that the @entity361 allows @entity3 to order limited missile strikes and report back to @entity316 afterward			0
last month , @entity364 chairman gen. @entity363 provided @entity316 with a list of declassified @entity5 military options for @entity8 that emphasized the high costs and risks of what he said would amount to " an act of war " at a time of deep budget cuts			1
@entity5 official : almost no doubt @entity46 regime used chemical weapons			2

@entity3 : @entity5 concludes " the @entity8 government " carried out chemical attacks
he tells " @entity35 " that he 's " not made a decision " about military action in @entity8
@entity173 echoes @entity354 's *assessment* that the attack poses a security threat
@entity42 wants robust action ; others warn of an escalating , open - ended conflict
