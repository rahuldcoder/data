@entity0 -- @entity5 , brother of @entity6 and chief compliance officer of @entity6 , is the subject of a criminal investigation , the @entity4 attorney 's office in @entity0 confirmed thursday			1
in a letter filed this week in federal court in @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity5 's attorney , @entity15 , says that the investigation was the reason that his client invoked his @entity20 right against self - incrimination at a deposition in a related case in november			1
@entity15 said he had been informed of the investigation into @entity5 's involvement in his brother 's ponzi scheme a week before the deposition , at which @entity5 declined to answer more than 290 questions			1
" given the circumstances and intensity of the criminal investigation , one can hardly question defendant 's constitutional right not to answer questions about his brother , @entity6 , his work at @entity39 ... and virtually any related topic for fear that such answers might ' furnish a link in the chain of evidence ' for a criminal prosecution , " @entity15 said in the letter to judge @entity30			2
the deposition was for a lawsuit brought against @entity5 by the @entity48 , which says it lost all of its investment with @entity6 : $ 7 million that the firm told the foundation had grown to an estimated $ 15 million			1
@entity15 's letter was filed in response to the foundation 's move to have @entity5 sanctioned for failing to be " cooperative " in the deposition			0
the attorney says the @entity48 -- a charitable private group headed by sen. @entity58 -- is an effort to " unfairly jump ahead of thousands of other investors " who also are seeking damages from @entity6			0
a separate lawsuit has been filed on behalf of all the business 's investors , who have lost an estimated $ 200 million in the scheme			0
in march , @entity6 pleaded guilty to 11 counts related to running the most massive @entity26 in history and was sentenced to 150 years in prison			2
