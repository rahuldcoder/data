-- in most ways , @entity1 is a superwoman			0
four basic rules of organization can help turn a messy home office into a tidy workstation			1
she has completed more than 50 triathlons and runs a business that teaches hundreds of women a year how to break into running , biking , and swimming			0
she also finds time to teach @entity15 at an elementary school near her home in @entity19 , @entity20 , and serves as den leader for the local @entity22 , all while looking after three sons : @entity24 , age three ; @entity26 , five ; and @entity27 , seven			1
when it came to organizing her home office , however , @entity1 , 35 , could barely get out of the starting blocks			1
her desk was so overloaded that she referred to it as " the abyss " and " the beast			1
" school reports , unpaid bills , and children 's artwork were piled in haphazard layers			1
and since mess has a way of inviting more mess , @entity45 's husband , @entity44 , and sons felt free to use her desk as a dumping ground for everything from junk mail to homework			1
as a result , birthday - party invitations resurfaced days too late and car registrations expired without being renewed			1
" anything that comes in the mail is a problem , " she says			0
to make matters worse , her office was set up in a former dining room , near the entrance of their home , so her disarray was on display to anyone coming or going			1
what she likes about the office the office is open , with high ceilings			2
from her desk , she can see her kids playing in the family room			2
what she dislikes about the office no privacy			2
it does n't feel inviting			0
not enough surface area for working			0
her desk is always covered with piles			2
the revelation a year ago , @entity45 received an album of special class events from her son @entity26 's teacher			1
in photos commemorating " cowboy day , " " pajama day , " and " red - clothing day , " @entity26 was conspicuously and consistently wearing the wrong outfit , because she had either lost the school notice or found it too late			2
" it was proof in print of my lack of organization , " she says			0
" at that point , i decided i had to do better			0
" sometimes even a coach can use some coaching			1
@entity0 volunteered to put @entity45 's office in order and set up a clear and simple system to ensure that no school notice goes missing and every race record has its place			1
now she can focus on fitness , not on finding missing files			0
the remedy following four basic rules of organization helped turn @entity45 's home office into a workstation as fit and flexible as its inhabitant			1
@entity45 's single biggest problem came from not separating her paperwork : it was impossible for her to work on one kind without constantly running across the other			1
now that she has her papers cleanly segregated , thanks to extra shelving , filing cabinets , and bins she can decide what she 'll work on , rather than being ambushed by an overdue bill or a renewal notice			0
formerly a catchall , with piles stowed in nooks and crannies , the desk is freed up for its intended purpose : reading and writing			2
papers that once covered her desk are still within reach , stowed in her original filing cabinets ( bills and other home expenses to the left , invoices and business materials to the right )			1
supplementary job materials , magazines , mailers , tear sheets are in labeled storage containers on five adjustable shelves installed above the desk			2
create a station for incoming and outgoing			0
a wire - mesh file mounted on the wall to the left of the desk helps her keep track of the flow to and from the office			1
the upper basket contains bills , bank statements , and other papers that require filing			2
the lower basket is for items to take the next time she leaves the house			0
" outgoing mail , notes for school , a racing shirt that has to be delivered , anything that 's urgent goes in there where i can see it , " she says			0
a portable filing box ( shown on the floor to the left of the desk ) allows her to easily carry files to meetings			2
consolidate , consolidate , consolidate			0
because she lacked shelves in her home office , @entity45 used to store fitness books and magazines in the nearby family room			1
since it was a pain to carry them back and forth , more often than not she simply dumped them on her desk			2
now that they are within easy reach , she 's more inclined to put them back where they belong			0
the ideas @entity209 : three bulletin boards mounted to the left of the desk help keep track of events in the three areas of @entity45 's daily life : home ( housekeeper 's phone number ) , children ( party invitations ) , and business ( race schedules )			1
closed storage : labeled boxes on shelves contain rarely used items , such as the report cards and artwork of her three sons , plus stationery , waivers , and other business paperwork			0
open storage : frequently accessed supplies , such as copier paper , are kept in open trays			0
a pink basket contains materials for special projects , such as medals for her son 's swim team			0
task lighting : a desk lamp helps her focus on the tasks at hand			2
timekeeper : an office clock adds a businesslike touch to remind her that , even at home , there are deadlines and duties that can not be put off			1
seating : she opted for a desk stool called the @entity262 ( $ 599 , www.swopper.com ) , which is designed to soothe the tight hamstrings and lower - back problems common among athletes			1
the update organizing is like a @entity269 's resolution : it 's hard to sustain			0
shortly after @entity45 's home office was overhauled , she says , her husband , @entity44 , voiced skepticism			1
it looked good , he told her , but he wondered if she could keep it that way			0
she used to spend up to an hour clearing her desk before she got to work , so " i used to have a dread of sitting at my desk , " she says			1
" it 's so much more appealing now			0
" the awkward piling of bills and school notices has been replaced by a clear - cut system : everything that lands on her desk has a specific place to go			1
" when you put things together from different areas of your life , it requires different systems of organization , " she says , " and i did n't know how to do that			0
