-- recently , a federal judge blocked the enforcement and implementation of the indefinite military detention authority that @entity5 passed late last year as part of the @entity7			1
it 's a welcome sign from our courts that constitutional safeguards still exist			0
when this provision was debated last year , we argued that it was an unwise expansion of law that jeopardized the freedoms of all @entity16			2
we were heartened that the court has wisely chosen to block this policy for much the same reason we opposed it			0
however , this federal court injunction is only temporary , and the debate over whether the military has the authority to indefinitely detain individuals captured on @entity16 soil without trial is far from over			2
earlier this year , we introduced legislation , recently co-sponsored by @entity16 rep. @entity29 , @entity30 , that would require that civilian law enforcement , including the @entity32 and civilian courts , take the lead with respect to those captured or detained in the @entity16			1
some , however , have argued that this approach to national security -- one that involves law enforcement and not solely the military -- is tantamount to ceding ground to @entity43			1
this argument , designed to paint members of @entity5 as " soft on terror , " is wrong on two fronts			0
first , enemies who want to attack us on our native soil -- particularly would - be suicide bombers -- do not intend to be captured and are not lured to @entity16 by the identity of their potential jailer or prosecutor			2
the strange assertion that our civilian courts and law enforcement system serves as an incentive for terrorists to come to @entity16 ignores the terrorists ' true motivations			1
the question of civilian versus military authority is irrelevant to our enemies			0
it is , however , incredibly important to protecting @entity16 ' constitutional rights and freedoms while still allowing us to effectively fight terrorism			2
second , our civilian law enforcement and justice system have worked exceptionally well in prosecuting , convicting and jailing dangerous terrorists			1
to say that the military is the only institution up to the task is an unfair indictment of the valiant work done by the men and women who have kept us safe since 9/11			0
we have convicted hundreds of terrorists in our federal civilian courts , with many of them incarcerated at the " @entity86 " prison in @entity84 , @entity85			0
yet military commissions in @entity88 have only resulted in seven convictions , and two of those terrorists have already been released			0
as @entity5 works to update our national defense policy and the courts continue to weigh the implications of allowing indefinite military detention without trial , we remain committed to defending our country from those who seek to do us harm , both abroad and here at home			1
the debate over protecting constitutional liberties alongside our counterterrorism efforts is not now and has never been an issue of rewarding terrorists -- just ask any inmate at @entity86			0
rather , as defense secretary @entity109 , fbi director @entity110 and director of national intelligence @entity111 advocated during last year 's debate , it 's about giving our law enforcement community the maximum ability to protect us within our constitutional system			1
this is a system that guarantees freedom and liberty to the @entity16 people alongside their safety and security			1
inviting our armed forces into our cities and towns with the power to indefinitely detain @entity16 without trial is a misguided attempt that erodes our rights to due process and limits the effectiveness of civilian law enforcement			1
this approach also would unnecessarily burden our military with a responsibility it does not want and , most importantly , does not make us safer			0
