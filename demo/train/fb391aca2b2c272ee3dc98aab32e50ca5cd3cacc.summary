@entity0 makes for inspiring , fascinating , confusing travel			2
to some , the chunk of territory between the @entity5 and the @entity6 is all @entity7			2
to others , it 's all @entity10			1
for most -- as is true so often in this region of shifting truths and manipulated historical narratives -- it 's a bit of both			1
more on @entity1 : @entity17 : @entity18 1			0
for beaches , it 's @entity21 , med or dead @entity7 is hemmed in by sea			1
@entity25 has snorkeling and beach activities on the @entity28 side			0
@entity29 has stunning cliffs on the @entity6 side			0
at the @entity33 you can float away at @entity34 , where the salty waters of this inland lake effortlessly support your body			0
identity is complicated onlookers frequently cast the conflict here as simply between @entity42 and @entity43			0
axe - grinders on both sides like to evoke an enduring death - struggle between @entity47 and @entity42			0
but for long stretches of history , no such struggle existed			0
in truth , the problems of the last century or so are both religious and political -- and it 's worthwhile knowing who 's who			1
most @entity7 ( a political identity ) are @entity56 ( a religious identity ) -- and most take pride in their country 's ethnic diversity			1
@entity62 , @entity63 , @entity42 , @entity64 , @entity43 @entity56 and many others mix more or less freely			0
there 's a reason for that			1
if you can satisfy @entity7 's religious establishment that you 're @entity56 -- according to complicated rules of birth , ancestry or conversion -- you instantly become entitled to @entity7 citizenship and state benefits			1
@entity77 ( a political identity ) -- most of whom are @entity43 ( a cultural identity ) -- are chiefly @entity47 , but there are substantial minorities of @entity77 @entity83 and others			0
the security barrier is worth seeing take a walking tour of @entity87 , such as those run by @entity89 , or a pilgrimage to the @entity77 city of @entity92 -- where @entity93 was born -- and you 'll run into @entity7 's infamous security barrier			1
@entity7 built this barrier to keep suicide bombers from getting to @entity7			0
it 's eight meters ( 26 feet ) high in places and includes concrete barricades , gates , barbed wire and patrol roads			1
while it has reduced the number of bombing attempts , it has also kept @entity77 from moving freely between the @entity105 and @entity7 proper			0
most of the barrier runs inside @entity105 territory , rather than on the boundary line			0
this fact prompted the @entity112 to rule that the construction of the barrier violated international law			0
with its armed guards , watchtowers and fortified gateways , for travelers it can be a stark symbol of @entity7 's military control over the territory			1
eco travelers will love the desert vast , scorching desert fills @entity7 's southern third -- known as the @entity128 in @entity129 or @entity128 in @entity130			1
despite the camels and the tents , few of the @entity128 's hippyish ecotours have much to do with some of the oldest inhabitants of this desert			1
@entity135 -- a social enterprise founded by civil rights activists -- offers a chance to hear @entity135 stories in person , hosted among @entity135 tribes			1
@entity87 resonates with religious meaning few people forget their first visit to the @entity145 at @entity87 's core , still encircled by the crenelated walls built by the @entity149 sultan @entity148 in 1538			1
within this tiny area , roughly one square kilometer , the @entity150 -- walked by @entity93 -- leads to the @entity152 , where @entity154 tradition says @entity93 was crucified and buried			0
steps away , @entity42 pray at the @entity156 , the last structure remaining from the @entity158 , destroyed by the @entity159			0
nearby , the @entity160 , mentioned in the @entity161 , stands alongside the golden @entity163 shrine commemorating the @entity165 's mystical @entity164			1
@entity160 and the @entity163 stand on a hill known as the @entity167 , or the @entity167 , considered holy by @entity47 , @entity42 and @entity83 as the place where @entity170 prepared to sacrifice his son			0
in terms of religious significance , that 's quite a plateful			1
and among the holy sites , daily life roars on : souks crowd the narrow , stone - flagged alleyways , children go to school , libraries jostle with restaurants			0
also on @entity1 : 10 of @entity7 's best museums 6			1
@entity87 has its own syndrome for some , the city can be too much			1
around 100 tourists each year succumb to @entity187 , a psychiatric condition linked to the city 's atmosphere of intensity			1
sufferers typically show signs of prolonged agitation and religious fervor , spending days -- often dressed in white robes ( typically a hotel bed sheet ) -- declaiming religious verses or preaching public sermons on moral purity			1
@entity202 feels like its own country an hour away from @entity87 , over on the coast , secular - minded @entity202 swings along amid beach parties , designer brands and hipster attitudes			1
during the @entity56 @entity211 -- the day of rest , which runs from friday sunset to saturday sunset -- western @entity87 remains quiet in prayerful contemplation , but @entity202 lives the high life , with seaside promenades , crowded stores and lounge bars packed			1
this hedonistic city , gazing west into the @entity6 sunset , has also carved out a new identity as a gay capital , offering a uniquely accommodating welcome to @entity223 visitors and residents			1
in a country where the @entity56 religious establishment generally calls the shots , @entity202 embodies a bubble of liberality and easygoing apathy			1
countryside walks are fantastic the @entity105 is crisscrossed by walking trails			2
many are devoted to nature , some -- such as @entity236 's @entity235 -- to culture			2
one of the best is the @entity240 , linking the @entity77 cities of @entity242 , @entity92 and @entity243 in a two - week trek			0
it 's also manageable in shorter day - stages , with overnight stops at homestays and rural guesthouses			2
@entity7 have a long tradition of nature tourism , centered on national parks , wildlife reserves and forest walks , including the stunning @entity254 , which coils through the hills above the sparkling sea of @entity257			0
visitors can plug into @entity7 's network of " zimmers " -- rural @entity260 ranging from farm stays to exclusive country retreats			2
when you visit @entity7 , you 're also visiting biblical @entity10 when you visit as a tourist , you 're visiting two distinct places			0
see only one , and you see only part of the whole picture			0
the sovereign state of @entity7 came into being -- apologies for the euphemism , and for glossing over the previous few millennia of history -- in 1948 , on a sliver of land along the @entity6 coast , in the northern hills and the southern deserts , adding the western districts of @entity87 after an initial outbreak of fighting with its @entity43 neighbors			1
this is where @entity7 culture and the @entity129 language thrive			0
the eastern parts of @entity87 ( including the ancient walled @entity145 ) , plus the kidney - shaped piece of @entity105 that surrounds @entity87 on three sides , the @entity289 and the @entity290 did not form part of the modern state of @entity7 at its creation in 1948 , but they came under @entity7 's control during the 1967 war			1
since then , @entity7 has effectively annexed @entity87 , putting it and other adjacent areas in the @entity105 under full @entity7 government control , while greatly expanding @entity7 settlements in the @entity105			1
at the same time , it unilaterally pulled its military and settlers out of @entity289 , but has maintained control over the area 's borders ( with the exception of the @entity306 border crossing between @entity289 and @entity307 )			2
the international community deems @entity7 's presence in @entity87 , the @entity105 and the @entity289 as an illegal occupation			1
these areas are where @entity77 culture and the arabic language are strongest			0
a @entity77 state , should one ever materialize alongside @entity7 , is likely to be centered on that kidney - shaped territory , known to most of the world as the @entity105 , along with the @entity289 along the @entity6			2
pockets of @entity7 culture thrive across the @entity105 in " settlements " -- @entity56 - only townships whose presence is widely seen as contravening international law			0
and pockets of @entity77 culture remain strong across @entity7 , from the urban clamor of @entity326 and @entity327 to rural hamlets in the countryside and desert			2
it 's prickly outside , but sweet inside @entity333 is the @entity129 word for cactus fruit -- prickly on the outside , sweet in the middle			2
it 's also how native - born @entity7 proudly describe themselves			2
the metaphor is apt. @entity342 graces are n't high on @entity7 's list of priorities , and service in shops and restaurants can be brusque			2
but if you peel away the prickly exterior , there 's generally warmth and affability beneath			2
intriguingly , the same word in @entity130 , saber , connotes patience and tenacity			0
tough hedges of cactus are still used to mark land boundaries across the @entity105 , and the idea is linked to a key concept in @entity77 self - identity -- sumud , meaning steadfastness or quiet resolve			0
one plant , two people , three interpretations			0

@entity87 offers the chance to see many of the world 's major religions in one city
some tourists suffer " @entity187 , " spending days agitated with religious fervor
an often *neglected* aspect is the countryside , which is great for *hiking*
