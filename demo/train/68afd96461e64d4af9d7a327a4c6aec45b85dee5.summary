@entity0 -- despite stopping production on the sitcom " @entity5 , " @entity2 said tuesday it will pay the show 's crew for the four episodes initially set to begin production this week			1
@entity2 spokesman @entity10 confirmed the payments will be made			0
according to @entity13 , the payments will amount to about $ 2 million for the 200 core crew members			1
@entity15 halted production of the show , starring @entity18 , after @entity18 's call to a radio show last week			1
on monday , @entity18 in interviews threatened to sue @entity15 over the action			1
he also told @entity23 he wanted $ 3 million per episode instead of the $ 2 million he was previously making , but later backed off that assertion , telling @entity1 's @entity26 that his only hard - and - fast demand was that he and the crew get paid for another eight weeks of work			1
@entity18 said he could " sort of understand why " show executives felt they had to intervene after a series of high - profile incidents he has been involved in , but reiterated to @entity1 that he felt his private life was his own business			1
he has also lashed out at the show 's co-creator , @entity36			0
@entity15 and @entity2 said in a joint statement last week that " based on the totality of @entity18 's statements , conduct and condition , @entity15 and @entity2 have decided to discontinue production of ' @entity5 ' for the remainder of the season			1
" @entity2 is owned by @entity46 , the parent company of @entity1			0

" i 've never had that in my past , " he said			0
" you can look as deep and as far as you want			0
" but @entity57 national director @entity67 said in a statement last week , " by invoking television producer @entity36 's @entity71 name in the context of an angry tirade against him , @entity18 left the impression that another reason for his dislike of mr. @entity36 is his jewishness			1
this fact has no relevance to mr. @entity18 's complaint or disagreement , and his words are at best bizarre , and at worst , borderline anti-semitism			2
" @entity13 reported tuesday that @entity18 's attorney sent the @entity57 a letter demanding a retraction because @entity18 's only intent was " to address the man rather than his television persona			2
" @entity57 spokesman @entity90 told @entity1 that " since @entity18 has made this a legal issue with the @entity57 , we will refrain from making any further comment at this time			2
" and a source close to @entity18 's ex-wife , @entity96 , sought tuesday to emphasize the couple 's two daughters , @entity99 and @entity100 , are with @entity96 , not with @entity18			0
the source asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue			0
