-- juice -- a basic staple of any hotel stay , right ? out on the breakfast buffet , with @entity5 leading the way and perhaps a choice of grapefruit , apple or tomato for the daring few who may feel like deviating from the mainstream			0
juice -- freshly - squeezed from an arcane assortment of veggies as well as fruit , and in more combinations than you can imagine , has become a unique selling point at several hotels this year			1
these are places that believe juice is not just for breakfast , but at the center of wellness or detox programs they say jaded travelers are crying out for			0
" business as well as leisure guests are buying big into our juice offerings , " says @entity30 , spa director of @entity31 , @entity32 , which has done so well with a new juice and wellness program , other hotels in the group are preparing to follow suit			1
" there 's been a real buzz in the group about how so many different categories of guests have embraced the chance to detox with fresh juice , " she says			1
" business travelers may not be able to devote themselves to the full wellness program , with scrubs and massages , but they 'll still do juice for breakfast and lunch , then go out for a regular business dinner			0
" they like the way it makes them feel so much , many finish their stay with a full - day juice detox			0
" these are not any old juices -- for morning , @entity31 is currently blending cantaloupe and ginger into its freshly - squeezed @entity5 -- the ginger works as an anti-inflammatory -- and proposing a pint of tomato - carrot - red pepper - cucumber - fennel and lime juice midmorning to improve digestive health			1
it gets a little out there by evening , when a pint of green juice pressed from kale , collard greens , romaine , cucumber and green apple is proposed as a meal replacement designed to detox the blood			0
working in the hotel ? room service is ready to deliver coconut water to sip throughout the day			0
a less likely venue than a @entity87 spa for a detox program is a big city hotel			0
but the @entity90 on @entity92 's @entity91 is introducing just that , under the direction of @entity96 's naturopath , @entity95			1
" it will give all the tools and support needed to begin a new lifestyle , including a pre-stay fridge analysis , a two - week detox and a follow - up motivation call , " says hotel spokesperson @entity97			0
" we know many guests are looking for ways to maintain a healthy lifestyle while traveling , " she adds , noting that the hotel will also create juices to guests ' own specifications , even if they 're not registered for the detox experience , which must be booked ahead			1
no advance warning , however , is needed for delivery of an @entity116 drink ( apple , raspberry and blackberry juice ) , a @entity120 ( orange , mango and pineapple ) , an apple - ginger - cucumber booster and similar health drinks			1
all are available at every bar and restaurant in the hotel or 24/7 via @entity130			0
another @entity92 hotel embracing juice in a big way is the uber - cool @entity134 , whose @entity135 has a " sin - free " section where mixologists create health drinks			1
choices include the @entity139 ( pink grapefruit , orange , dandelion , burdock , lemon and pineapple juice ) and the @entity146 in which scary - sounding " stabilized oxygen " is added to orange juice with hemp seeds and vitamin c powder			1
in the @entity153 spa , guests can find more exotic drinks like goji berries from the high @entity157 plateau , blended with seaberry , pomegranate or lychee juice			2
guests can also create their own smoothies at the @entity134 , indicating that juicing may become an activity in its own right rather than merely a means to an end			1
at the @entity165 in @entity166 , @entity167 , guests can create their own combinations from an assortment of fruit and veg including kale , beets , parsley , ginger and celery at the @entity178 organic juice bar			1
and the @entity180 " experiential " resort is offering an actual class in pressing fresh juice at both its @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 properties -- yes , it 's called juicing 2.0			2
and it 's also not just for breakfast -- guests learn to convert what they 've pressed into soups , dips , spreads , desserts and salsas as well as mere healthy juices			1
other places to get stuck seriously into the fresh stuff include : @entity198 , @entity199 this luxury , all - inclusive spa resort puts fresh juice at the center of its holistic offerings , allowing lots of experimentation at no extra cost			0
the cafe - deli features such unusual combinations as the @entity208 ( celery stalks , carrot , parsley and asparagus ) to prevent arthritis and lower blood pressure , the anti-oxidant @entity215 ( apple , beet and carrot ) and the @entity220 high - protein drink involving fresh papaya juice and - er - peanut butter			1
it contains soy isoflavones which some say help reduce bad cholesterol , regulate glucose levels and improve kidney filtration			0
@entity231 , @entity230 creative director @entity229 has created juice pairings for food in the restaurants and bars of the fashion brand 's first resort , as well as a range of stylish " mocktails			2
" guests can opt for a " heavenly orchard , " featuring , apple , pear , quince and citrus juices blended with locally - grown cinnamon			1
they can get a blackberry julep in which the berries are pressed with plenty of fresh mint , then hit with fresh lime juice and a shot of sparkling water			2
destinations where you do n't need a fancy hotel to get superb freshly - squeezed juice include : @entity258 -- juice stands abound , pressing everything from bananas ( much juicier than starchy western varieties ) to avocados , with all the other usual fruit and veggie suspects			2
your hotel will offer them too			0
@entity268 -- residents love fresh carrot juice even more than their freshly squeezed @entity5 , and often combine them half and half			0
look for juice stands everywhere in @entity274 and @entity275 , and expect to find fresh carrot juice on the breakfast buffet alongside a wide variety of other juices			2
@entity279 -- freshly squeezed @entity5 is a birthright in this country , and in @entity283 you 'll find at least 20 stands competing for your business on the main square , the @entity287			0
since it costs less than 35 cents a glass , you can try all the vendors to find your favorite before your stay is out , but you may want to bring your own glass for hygiene reasons			0
on a scale of 1 to 10 , how do you feel about healthy options at hotels ? what are your favorite offerings ?			2
