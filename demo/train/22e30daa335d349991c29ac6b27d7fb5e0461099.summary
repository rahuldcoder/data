-- if you 're going to pursue an elusive killer , you sometimes have to get creative			0
a pioneering study into malaria transmission in @entity5 , using data gleaned from the cell phones of nearly 15 million people , has given scientists new clues into how the deadly disease spreads			1
by tracking the population 's movement over a year using cell phone data and comparing it with detailed information on malaria infection rates across the country , the study reveals how human travel contributes to the disease 's spread			1
the study , led by researchers at @entity24 and seven other institutions , could inform how governments -- particularly in @entity27 -- act in future to control the disease 's spread			2
malaria deaths are concentrated in that part of the continent			0
published in the journal @entity36 on thursday , the study , " quantifying the impact of human mobility on malaria , " gives key insights into a disease that kills a child a minute in @entity27 , according to the @entity40			1
" this is the first time that such a massive amount of cell phone data -- from millions of individuals over the course of a year -- has been used , together with detailed infectious disease data , to measure human mobility and understand how a disease is spreading , " said senior author @entity44 , an assistant professor of epidemiology at @entity24			1
since the disease is passed on to humans by mosquitoes that carry the malaria parasite , the movement of infected people into areas of lower incidence is an important factor			1
between june 2008 and june 2009 , lead author @entity63 , a @entity65 doctoral student , and her team mapped every call or text made by 14,816,521 @entity5 mobile phone subscribers to one of 11,920 cell towers in 692 different settlements			0
this allowed them to follow the destination and duration of each trip made from the cell phone user 's primary place of residence			2
using detailed data from a malaria prevalence map for 2009 , drawn up by the @entity84 and the @entity85 , the researchers determined that malaria largely emanates from western @entity5 's @entity88 region and spreads east , chiefly toward the capital , @entity90			1
the team " found that a surprisingly large fraction of ' imported ' infections â € ” that is , infections that are carried by people moving from one place to another â € ” wind up in @entity90 , with infected residents returning there after journeys to spots such as @entity88 or the coast , " the news release says			2
this may lead to an increased risk of local transmission within @entity90 and its surrounding areas , despite the lower number of mosquitoes , or " malaria vectors , " in urban areas			2
the research suggests that efforts to control malaria could benefit from a focus on " source " areas where incidence is high , rather than on areas where fewer people are infected			0
human travel patterns mean the parasite is likely repeatedly to be carried back to areas where it has been almost eliminated			1
the study advises that on a very local scale , " hot spots of transmission can be targeted by indoor residual spraying , vector habitat removal , insecticides , drug administration , and bed - net use			0
" but attempts to control transmission by targeting human travel between regions " will be completely different from those that concentrate on local transmission hot spots , focusing on communicating risks to travelers to alter their behaviors , restricting travel patterns , and / or conducting routine surveillance in high - risk areas			2
" this could mean encouraging people from areas of high prevalence to use insecticide - treated bed nets when traveling to areas of lower malaria incidence to avoid bringing the parasite with them			1
it also advises visitors to areas such as @entity88 to take greater care not to become infected before their return home			0
@entity63 acknowledges certain limitations such as following only cell phone users in areas where there are cell towers and inability to track people 's cross-border movements			1
however , the importance of such research into one of the world 's largest preventable causes of death should not be underestimated			0
there were about 216 million cases of malaria worldwide in 2010 and about 655,000 deaths from the disease that year , according to the @entity40			0
understanding and preventing the disease 's spread from areas of high incidence is a key weapon in the fight against malaria			0
the innovative research could also point the way for other studies into infectious diseases , helped by ever growing rates of cell phone usage worldwide , and particularly in the developing world			2
" as mobile phone data sets become increasingly available and representative of entire populations , we anticipate that studies like the one we present here will become common for understanding a range of different infectious diseases , as well as for gaining greater insight into human behavior on a population level , " the study 's authors say			1
the @entity40 's 2011 world malaria report shows that concerted efforts to tackle the disease can make a difference , with death rates down by more than 25 % globally since 2000			0
@entity0 's @entity209 contributed to this report .			0

researchers use cell phone data to track movement of about 15 million people
using data on malaria prevalence , they can see how human travel contributes to its spread
many @entity90 residents carry the malaria parasite back with them after traveling elsewhere
