" " i was walking down @entity85			2
everything was so razed over , it was disorienting because some of the streets -- you could n't even tell where you were at			2

" about 1,500 people are still unaccounted for			1
but " when we open up the area and start letting them come back in ... that number of unaccounted for will start to dwindle , " @entity153 said			1
many of those 1,500 have scattered because of tornado damage and communication problems			1
@entity0 fire chief @entity163 said the second search and rescue effort basically follows the tornado 's path			1
" we 're searching every structure that 's been damaged or destroyed in a more in - depth manner , " he said			0

we were about 30 seconds in front of them , one block , " @entity208 's sister , @entity216 , told @entity2			0
" my dad called and he said , ' open the garage door			0
' ... and then i just heard him say , ' pull over , @entity208			0
' and then they started flipping			0
" " my dad said -- when my dad gained consciousness , he said that he saw my brother -- his seat belt snapped and he was ejected through the sunroof , " she added			0

" the tornado that carved through the city of about 50,000 on sunday is the deadliest to hit @entity7 soil since the @entity35 began keeping records 61 years ago			1
the @entity35 notes seven deadlier twisters , but says those took place " before the years of comprehensive damage surveys , " so they may have been the result of multiple tornadoes			2
but the @entity35 does say that the @entity258 of 1925 , which tore across southeast @entity1 , southern @entity259 and southwest @entity260 , killed 695 people -- " a record for a single tornado			1

one hit @entity270 and the town of @entity272 , killing 78 people , and another struck @entity274 and @entity275 , killing 61			2
with crews still sifting through rubble , the death toll could continue to climb			0
" i think the more time that goes by , the more i feel sick about it , " @entity279 , a lifelong @entity0 resident , said tuesday			1
" these people are cold and sick and stuck			2
as the days go on , and the death toll goes up , how many funerals are we going to go to ? " @entity0 mayor @entity286 said monday night that his community has n't given up			1
" we hope that there are people alive			2
we have a number of apartment buildings , complexes that are almost completely flattened			0
so we anticipate finding more people , and hopefully we 'll get there in time to find them alive , " he said			2
the tornado chewed through a densely populated area of the city , eliminating a high school and making a direct hit on one of the two hospitals in the city			1
@entity286 pledged not to let the tornado ruin his city			1
" this is just not the type of community that 's going to let a little f - 4 tornado kick our ass			2
so we will rebuild , and we will recover			0
