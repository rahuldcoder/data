@entity0 -- allegations that @entity6 prime minister @entity5 had sex with a teenage prostitute are " mud " thrown on him by political opponents who want to get rid of him , the scandal - prone politician said			1
" but this time they 've surpassed any limit , " @entity5 said in a statement			1
" the mud will fall on those who use justice as a political weapon			0
" the " judicial machination ... will not succeed in stopping us or in taking us away from our commitment to change the country			0
this time also they will not succeed , " he said in the statement posted on his party 's website saturday			2
@entity5 is under investigation for allegedly having sex with the teenager , say prosecutors in @entity33 , who are linking the case to prostitution activity			1
the teen , identified as nightclub dancer @entity37 and nicknamed @entity38 , was 17 at the time of the alleged activity , from february till may			1
she denied ever having sex with him in an interview recorded saturday and broadcast sunday			0
she said @entity5 was " a person who is accused of something he has never done			1
" if you want to write , then write things that are true and not these lies and bar - room gossip , " she told journalists and prosecutors			0
" if you do n't like @entity5 , then attack him with something else			2
not with this taking advantage of a girl			0
" but she said she had received 7,000 euros ( about $ 9,300 ) from him the first time they met , on @entity61 2010 , because a friend told @entity5 she needed help			1
she said she was a guest at several dinners he gave , but that she did not know him well			0
she told the prime minister , among others , that she was 24 " because i did n't want people to know that i was a minor , " she said in the interview broadcast on @entity6 's @entity72			1
the @entity33 prosecutor said @entity5 is being probed for complicity in prostitution with a minor and abuse of power			2
@entity6 media reports say @entity5 has been summoned for questioning from january 21 to 23 , but it is unclear if he will answer the prosecutor 's summons			1
the premier 's attorneys called the investigation " absurd and groundless " and a " grave interference " in @entity5 's private life			1
@entity33 prosecutors started the investigation of this case in december after the premier called police and urged the teen 's release from prison			0
she had been arrested in may on charges of theft			0
prosecutors also sent police to search the home of @entity99 , a member of @entity5 's party and a @entity102 regional council member			1

the teen is now 18 and is considered an adult			0
the premier has always denied having any involvement with any prostitutes or helping prostitution or having wild parties at this house			0
the latest investigation emerges after @entity6 's @entity117 struck down last week key parts of a law that would protect @entity5 from prosecution			1
the law was designed to halt criminal proceedings against top government officials for 18 months on the grounds that they are too busy to appear in court			2
but @entity6 's top court ruled that judges , not politicians , should be the ones to determine if a defendant is free to appear in court			1
separate trials against @entity5 are pending			2
he 's accused of bribing a witness to commit perjury in one case and of tax fraud and other financial irregularities in another			2
both trials began but were suspended when the immunity law was passed			0
@entity5 has called the charges politically motivated			0
a third case against the prime minister , also related to tax fraud , is in preliminary stages			1
@entity5 has been tried on at least 17 charges since first taking office as prime minister in 1994 , but he remains very popular with the @entity6 public			1
@entity1 's @entity148 contributed to this report .			0
