@entity0 , @entity1 -- i was just leaving @entity5 's building for the day when all hell broke loose			1
fast - footing it in the middle of @entity9 , i watched in raw terror as the @entity11 collapsed in front of me			2
a blood - soaked woman emerged out of the storm of dust and debris and after i assisted her to @entity18 , it soon dawned on me that much of the city center was raining down on its citizens			2
gazing to the south of @entity18 , a billowing column of dust blocked any view of the @entity27 building			1
it was n't until later in the day that i was confronted with the brutal reality that the dust was n't blocking the view , but it was the dust of the building 's remains			2
after frantically ensuring my family members were all safe , and taking stock of my own smashed - up house , my thoughts and prayers have been transfixed on my @entity27 family			1
for the past 10 years , the regional television channel has been a trusty employer for me , broadcasting my weekly current affairs program			1
at the time of writing , it would be inappropriate for me to name all of the staff that have been killed in this mass tragedy			2
my heart has been torn by the unwieldy weight of grief , as i reflect on 17 much - loved workmates who i will never share a tv studio with again			2
seventeen passionate , resolute workmates who believed in regional television and made it work			0
@entity27 was not just " a shopping channel , " as some people have scoffed			1
it served as a mirror on our region and that mirror has been so grotesquely shattered			0
and @entity27 has been the career launch - pad for dozens and dozens of tv journalists , who now appear on our nightly network news programs			1
@entity27 was the longest - running television channel in @entity1 , and although it will never be the same , it will rise again to serve our region			1
one day at a time			0
like many @entity72 , my mind is haunted with the apocalyptic scenes of our devastated city			0
i am sick to the pit of my stomach at the wrenching loss of life and casualty toll			0
why did so many modern buildings implode ? in hindsight , were we too impatient and " she 'll be right " in agitating for the city center to return to " business as usual " so soon ? how long should it be closed for now ? what will it take before people trust our city center , and feel safe in the buildings that remain ? how many people will trust the land they have lived and worked on ? i know many @entity72 who simply can not take it anymore and have abandoned the city they love , indefinitely			0
there are no fast solutions			0
for tens of thousands of folk , even securing basic services like power , water and sewage is going to be a marathon wait			0
just as the @entity109 has been understandably cancelled , @entity0 's share of the @entity108 does not look viable			1
where will people stay ? how fast can @entity112 be repaired ? should resources be diverted from key infrastructure work for the sake of this rugby tournament ? there are so many questions and clouds of doubt			0
as much as we are exhorted to uphold our plucky , resilient spirit , i have huge fears about how much repair and rebuilding work can be done in time for winter			0
can our viciously wounded city continue to support and sustain 400,000 people while major infrastructure and rebuilding work is undertaken ? how can we seriously house everyone ? i suspect a substantial portion of our population will need to relocate out of @entity0 , in the medium term , while the large - scale reconstruction work is carried out			1
@entity0 will rise again , @entity0 will shine again			1
but the slow road to recovery is going to be herculean .			0
