" evading a popular test [ by not participating in the parliamentary elections ] only means that some people want to assume the executive powers without a democratic mandate , " @entity23 said on the party 's @entity32 page			1
" @entity39 [ in the upcoming elections ] is the best choice for any politician who has any popular support			2
because if he or she has a popular majority then this will be reflected in majority wins or seats won that can translate into participation in the executive branch or remaining in @entity29 as an opposition force , " @entity23 said			0
