@entity0 , @entity1 -- actress @entity3 hit the big time when she starred in " @entity5 " as @entity6 , sister of the deranged @entity7			1
since then she has appeared in hit movies including " @entity9 " and " @entity10 "			2
@entity3 has always refused to play the @entity12 fame game			1
but @entity13 has refused to play the @entity12 fame game and seems drawn to challenging roles in controversial movies , including " the situation " , about the current @entity18 war , and " @entity19 " , about the anti-globalization riots that took place in @entity22 in 1999			1
@entity13 now lives in the @entity23 and returns to @entity0 every year			1
she talks to @entity25 , my life about what makes the city , and its people , so special			1
@entity2 : how do you define yourself ? @entity3 : i absolutely refuse the fame part of my business			1
i refuse even the money side of my business			1
i try to do as good work as i can do , i try to grow in my art and reach for truth			2
that 's what i want from my art , that 's what i aspire to			2
i try to combine my work with my family , that 's what i aspire to			2
i do n't say that 's the only thing			2
it 's not all work and family , because otherwise you would be saying no to the many other things in life and there are many other things			2
@entity2 : the people here are supposed to be incredibly happy -- what do you think ? @entity3 : i think it 's funny in a way because when i grew up here it was very unusual to hear the word " happiness "			1
if you asked somebody , " what do you wish for in life ? " they would n't say " happiness			2
" i would have answered " excitement , knowledge , " @entity70 knows -- i mean , many , many different things , but certainly not " happiness "			2
it seemed like a foreign concept to wish for something that specific and that singular			2
and i think that a lot of @entity79 kind of feel like that about being the happiest people in the world			2
@entity2 : is there anything you 'd like to change about the city ? @entity3 : anywhere there are social buildings that stuff people into boxes , concentrate poor people there			1
it 's specific to any big city			1
there was an effort to create buildings that concentrate these people very closely , and their social problems			0
they are still around in @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and here too			0
so if i could change anything about @entity0 , or any other major big city , i would change the way we build buildings or housing for lower income people			1
i do n't think people who are already burdened with social , economic , psychological situations , dysfunctional families , need to be burdened with other people with the same problems			0
@entity2 : is the city politically driven ? @entity3 : i do n't think i can remember a moment in my life where people did n't discuss politics			1
people discuss politics at the table			0
i think some of the first information i received was politically charged ( laughs )			0
it was at a time when girls were being told , " why do n't you go and learn how to repair machines rather than learn to repair your jumper ? why do n't you learn to cut wood rather than learn to keep a house clean ? " in school			0
it was to make us conscious of what we were , how we defined ourselves and why you would accept one concept of yourself rather than another			0
have you searched through the truth of that concept ? have you deconstructed ? have you made sure that its foundations are valid ? that 's how i grew up and i think it was wonderful			0
@entity2 : how would you describe the city architecturally ? @entity3 : it 's everything here from very late renaissance to this 19th century golden age we had here			1
it 's that , intermixed with pure @entity79 modernism			0
i love the juxtaposition of it all			0
i love when we bring in metaphors for our past as well			0
@entity2 : a lot of the places you have taken us to have been very romantic , do you think there is a fairy tale quality to @entity0 ? @entity3 : an alternative society ... yes i do , i do feel that			1
i do feel that most things are possible here			0
@entity2 : what is it about the city that makes people creative ? @entity3 : well , we have a very , very long winter and it gets a little boring , so you better think of something to do ! it can get deathly boring , so you start using your imagination			1
sometimes it 's necessity that produces it , because you need to do something			0
@entity2 : is there something about the people here that want to change things for the better ? @entity3 : i think so -- i think we 're an idealistic people			1
i think there are disillusioned people everywhere , there are doubters everywhere , but i do think there are constructive people here ; i do think that people believe in people			0
@entity2 : do you take any inspiration from the city ? @entity3 : yes , yes i do			1
whenever i come back here i remember that i want to write poetry ( laughs )			0
i want to take more time to sit and paint some more			0
i want to do so many more things whenever i come back -- i 'm always reminded of that when i come here			0
@entity2 : you 've lived in lots of cities all over the world and still do			0
why is @entity0 special to you ? @entity3 : i was born here and it 's the capital of my home country			1
it 's also immensely beautiful			1
many of my friends live here and much of my partner 's family lives here too and so we bring our kids back here every year			0
it holds all the museums that hold our history , our culture , and i take our children there and i go there for my own pleasure all the time			1
i love going to museums			1
i love this city and i love cities that are on the water			2
i love the water element , specifically the sea			0
i grew up on the sea and i grew up sailing -- i love sailing -- and the presence of the sea gives the air and the light a very special quality that i absolutely adore			1
@entity2 : it seems that for a small place it has a lot of cultural influence			0
@entity3 : yes , it 's sort of a little pearl in the middle of the seas			1
there 's a lot of traffic through this place , from the east , west , north and south			0
and we are the southern part of the north , so everything from the south comes up here on its way towards the north , and the opposite			0
and it has left its mark			0
we are definitely some kind of place where culture is being deposited over and over and over again , but it also springs from here			2
it 's the kind of place that attracts creative people and so it springs from here too			2
@entity2 : if @entity0 was a person , how would you describe it ? @entity3 : if @entity0 were a person , that person would be generous , beautiful , elderly , but with a flair			1
a human being that has certain propensities for quarrelling , filled with imagination and with appetite for the new and with respect for the old -- somebody who takes good care of things and of people .			0

@entity3 says she refuses the fame and money side of acting
she says the long winters mean the *residents* have to be creative
@entity0 is full of history and culture , and @entity13 loves its museums
the city is very beautiful and the light has " a very special quality , " she says
