he compared it to a massacre of students during a @entity36 demonstration in 1968			2
" at that time , these kinds of things happened : mass disappearances of people , where no one was held accountable , " he told the newspaper			0
yet in the 21st century , he said , @entity29 " has overcome these kinds of practices			0
