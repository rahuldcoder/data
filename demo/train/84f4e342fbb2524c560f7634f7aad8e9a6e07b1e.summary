@entity0 -- the efforts by leaders of @entity4 and @entity5 to broker a nuclear deal with @entity7 reflects growing dissatisfaction with the traditional world order in which the @entity10 is the only superpower , which they view as outdated and unjust			1
and their intervention on the @entity7 issue reflects a growing perception among many countries that the @entity10 is unable to resolve international conflicts alone			1
the visit this week to @entity19 by @entity4 prime minister @entity20 and @entity5 president @entity21 was a rare show of personal , high - stakes diplomacy by a pair of world leaders			1
@entity4 and @entity5 hailed the agreement they reached for @entity7 to ship some of its nuclear fuel out of the country as a major step toward resolving @entity7 's years - old standoff with the @entity32			1
but it was promptly pooh - poohed by the @entity10 , which , a day after the deal was announced , introduced a sanctions resolution to the @entity37 @entity36 in what was perceived widely in @entity39 and @entity40 as an @entity10 snub of two close allies			1
the @entity44 administration never really supported @entity4 and @entity5 's diplomatic efforts			1
while @entity10 officials were prepared to be pleasantly surprised if @entity21 and @entity20 were able to produce a deal that addressed all their concerns about @entity7 's nuclear program , they did n't think that it would happen and were concerned the deal would complicate efforts to pass the @entity37 resolution			1
for @entity21 and @entity20 , however , the introduction of the resolution handicaps their efforts to get @entity7 to cooperate			1
@entity5 and @entity4 , both emerging democracies , have been eagerly flexing their muscles on the international stage for some time			1
some of their reasons for pursuing a more active global diplomatic role are similar , others are quite different			0
@entity39 's interest in trying to mediate the standoff with @entity7 is primarily regional , driven by the desire to avoid a conflict on its border			0
@entity7 is also a large trading partner with whom @entity4 has lucrative oil and gas deals			1
@entity7 is n't the first issue @entity4 has tried to mediate between countries in its neighborhood			2
in 2008 @entity4 led indirect talks between @entity77 and @entity78 , although there was no breakthrough			0
for years @entity4 has sought to position itself as a bridge between @entity82 and @entity32			0
even as it plays an important role in @entity84 and seeks to join the @entity85 , @entity4 has clung to its @entity87 identity			0
this week @entity39 announced its bid to host the summit meeting of leaders of the @entity91 in 2014			0
@entity4 argues it is uniquely poised to coax the @entity7 regime into cooperating with the international community			2
@entity4 foreign minister @entity94 recently told a group of reporters in @entity0 that no country understands the @entity7 mindset and culture like @entity4			2
in addition to sharing a border , he noted the two countries share a long history and that many @entity7 speak @entity4 , including @entity7 president @entity104			2
@entity21 , who leaves office at the end of the year , also saw himself as the one leader who could broker a deal between @entity7 and the @entity32			2
but his interest is largely for that of his stature and his country 's			0
as one of the world 's big emerging economies , @entity5 and the other @entity117 countries -- @entity5 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 -- account for about half of the global growth and represent 40 percent of the world 's population			0
@entity21 has artfully parlayed his country 's newfound economic influence into a role for @entity5 as a growing world power hugely popular at home and abroad , @entity21 was hailed by newspapers around the world as a talented diplomat when the @entity7 deal was announced			1
but privately @entity10 officials complain that @entity21 is trying to play statesman at the expense of their own diplomatic efforts			1
" for him it 's a brass ring , " one senior @entity10 official said			0
" @entity7 just happens to be convenient			0
" it may be a little of both			0
@entity21 has spent much of his seven - year term advocating for a greater international role for @entity5 , including a permanent seat at the @entity37 , which he argues is dominated by a handful of nations			2
he has positioned himself as a leader of @entity149 's growing leftist movement and has been able to skillfully balance @entity5 's growing partnership with @entity0 with warm relations with @entity10 foes like @entity154 's @entity153 and @entity104			2
perhaps most importantly , @entity21 has become a champion of developing nations , many of which have a different world view than the @entity10			0
this " different " world view includes the notion that sanctions are not an effective means of diplomacy and only leaders to escalation , a belief which @entity4 shares			0
the @entity10 lost much of its credibility over the war in @entity171 , @entity172 and , more recently , the world economic crisis			0
while @entity5 and @entity4 both have good relationships with the @entity10 , they have sought to fill what they see as the leadership vacuum left by @entity149			1
while @entity44 has made it a priority to restore @entity10 prestige around the world , he faces no shortage of thorny international issues : wars in @entity171 and @entity188 , extremism in @entity190 , the @entity82 conflict and @entity193 's antics to name a few			0
emerging powers like @entity5 and @entity4 are ready , willing and eager to help solve them if the @entity10 will let them .			1

intervention from @entity4 , @entity5 reflects dissatisfaction with @entity10 leadership , @entity198 says
@entity5 , @entity4 tout nuclear agreement reached with @entity7
the next day , @entity10 introduced sanctions resolution to @entity36
for @entity21 and @entity20 , resolution handicaps their efforts to work with @entity7 , @entity198 says
