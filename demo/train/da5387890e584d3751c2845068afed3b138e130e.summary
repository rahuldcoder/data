-- " like a square peg going into a round hole			2
" that 's how @entity4 , an @entity5 man who spotted and helped lead authorities to @entity7 and 16 - year - old @entity7 , described the pair			1
@entity7 is now dead , shot and killed by an @entity10 agent in the @entity5 wilderness			1
he was suspected in the slayings of @entity7 's mother and brother in @entity15 and in the girl 's kidnapping			1
" they were just like a square peg going into a round hole			0
he might have been an outdoorsman in @entity15 , but he was not an outdoorsman in @entity5 , " @entity4 told reporters sunday			0
" he just did n't fit			0
" @entity4 , his wife , @entity26 , and another couple , @entity28 and @entity29 , were out on horseback when they happened upon @entity7 and @entity7 on wednesday twice , once on a trail and once at a lake			1
red flags went up immediately			0
all their gear looked brand new , said @entity4			0
they had no rain equipment			0
another flag , said @entity38 , was that @entity7 said he was headed for the @entity40 , but was going in the wrong direction			1
@entity7 hid her face and looked kind of scared , he said			1
@entity38 and the others thought that maybe their horses had frightened her			0
she and @entity7 were hiking			1
she was wearing what looked like either sweatpants or pajamas , @entity38 said			0
he noticed they had a two - man tent set up in a ridge			2
the camping spot had no water , and a tent on a ridge would act like a " lightning rod , " @entity38 said			0
" usually when you meet people in the back country , you have a pretty good encounter , you know , and talk about where they 've been and where they 're going			0
but they did n't want to talk , " he told reporters			0
after their group passed @entity7 and @entity7 , he turned to the others and said he thought something was n't right			1
" just kind of a gut feeling , you know , like they did n't belong , " said @entity38			1
' one chance in a trillion ' their group ran into @entity7 and @entity7 later at a lake			1
the girl was soaking her feet in the water , and @entity7 was off to the side petting a gray cat , said @entity4			1
just as he and the others were getting ready to go , @entity7 said something that made little sense at the time			1
" she said , ' looks like we 're all in trouble now , ' or ' we 're in real trouble now , ' " said @entity4			0
" i thought it extremely strange			0
" no one in his group was aware of the massive manhunt under way			2
@entity7 had been missing since august 3			1
the bodies of her mother , @entity99 , and 8 - year - old brother , @entity101 , were found one day later in @entity7 's burned house in @entity103 , @entity15			1
but eventually , @entity4 , a former county sheriff and retired @entity105 officer , called police			0
after he and his wife got home thursday , he turned on the television and saw an @entity110 for @entity7			2
she looked like the girl they 'd just seen			0
" for us to be there at the precise time to interact with them -- it 's one chance in a trillion , " @entity113 said			1
her husband 's call set off a series of events that ended late saturday in @entity7 's death and @entity7 's rescue			1
hundreds of law enforcement agents scoured 300 square miles of rough terrain , hampered by the smoke from nearby wildfires			0
they spotted the pair 's campsite near @entity132 , @entity5			2
the topography was so steep that helicopters had to drop authorities off far away from the camp			2
hostage rescue teams hiked more than two hours to get to the scene			0

at some point , a " confrontation " ensued between authorities and @entity7 , @entity142 @entity141 said			1
an @entity10 tactical agent shot and killed the murder and kidnapping suspect			0
@entity149 , spokeswoman for @entity5 's @entity151 sheriff 's office , praised the horseback riders sunday , hailing their contribution to the case as critical			2

@entity0 's @entity162 and @entity163 contributed to this report .			2
