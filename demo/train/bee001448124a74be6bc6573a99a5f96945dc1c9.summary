@entity0 -- the case : routine			2
one man 's summary of the facts : anything but			2
chief justice @entity7 shows his writing chops in a dissenting @entity10 opinion			1
the man in this case is the top man at the @entity10 , chief justice @entity7 , who on tuesday turned a brief dissent in a criminal appeal into something straight out of a @entity17 detective novel			1
he offered his thoughts in a case about whether a police officer 's arrest of a drug suspect was proper			1
let @entity23 tell the story in his own words : " @entity26 , may 4 , 2001			2
officer @entity27 , @entity29 , was working the morning shift			2
the neighborhood ? tough as a three - dollar steak			2
five years on the beat , nine months with the @entity29			0
he 'd made fifteen , twenty drug busts in the neighborhood			0
" @entity34 spotted him : a lone man in the corner			0
cash handed over ; small objects handed back			0
each man then quickly on his own way			0
@entity34 knew the guy was n't buying bus tokens			0
he radioed a description and officer @entity52 picked up the buyer			0
sure enough : three bags of crack [ cocaine ] in the guy 's pocket			0
head downtown and book him			0
just another day at the office			0
" the @entity62 ultimately tossed out the suspect 's conviction on possession of a controlled substance			0
seven of @entity7 colleagues rejected an opportunity to fully hear the state 's appeal , prompting his turn at creative opinion - writing			1
justice @entity73 agreed with @entity7 ' conclusions , if not his flair for @entity77 - style rhetoric			1
@entity7 later got serious in his dissent , writing , " i think the police clearly had probable cause to arrest the defendant			1
" this is not the first time the 53 - year - old chief justice has spiced up his writings with cultural references			2
in a july dissent in an especially dry case over who can file certain lawsuits , he quoted singer @entity91			1
amid arcane talk of legal standing and redressability , the youngest member of the high court showed his generational bearings by citing part of the lyrics from @entity91 's " like a @entity101			1
" " the absence of any right to the substantive recovery means that respondents can not benefit from the judgment they seek and thus lack @entity107 standing			0
' when you got nothing , you got nothing to lose			0
' " @entity7 then acknowledged the line came from the singer 's 1965 album " @entity114 , " and even helpfully added the record label in parentheses ( @entity117 )			1
court historians will note it is very likely the first time a rock lyric was cited in a high court opinion			2
but in a profession that values accuracy , @entity7 got it wrong			1
the actual lyric on " @entity114 " goes , " when you ai n't got nothing , you got nothing to lose " -- note the word " ai n't			0
" the elusive " ai n't " has been debated by @entity91 scholars			1
@entity91 's own web site , bobdylan.com , does not include " ai n't " in the lyrics			1
other references are divided on the issue , and there are certainly recorded versions of the song that do n't include it			1
but at least on " @entity114 , " @entity91 does indeed say " ai n't			1
" perhaps the law clerks provided @entity7 with an incorrect citation			1
or maybe the chief justice just remembered the line differently from his younger , less stuffy days			0
the chief justice never explained the reasons behind his literary leanings			2
he does n't have to .			0

@entity7 ' opinions show literary flair , include pop culture references
opinion in police search case *parroted* style of *gumshoe* *mystery*
he once misquoted @entity91 song " like a @entity101 " in an opinion
