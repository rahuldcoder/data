-- when i was 8 , i joined the @entity2			0
i lasted three weeks -- could n't get the hang of all that knot tying , and no one was interested in singing show tunes around the campfire			2
i was gay and i knew it			0
at that time , revealing my sexual identity would have resulted in my exclusion from @entity11			0
until the @entity13 's historic may 23 vote -- which allows gay youth to join the scouts , but upholds the ban on gay adult leaders -- thousands of boys across the country faced similar discrimination from the @entity2 , who actively and vocally banned gays			1
the @entity2 ' decision to include gay youth is part of the sea change sweeping across the @entity27 on the issue of gay equality , an issue that has long centered on equal rights for all			1
but discrimination , in the @entity2 as in every walk of life , brings with it another effect that is left out of the conversation on rights : poorer health			2
hiding one 's sexual identity and being excluded from activities and social groups causes stress , and research shows this can have a significant impact on health			0
in her review of the health of gay youth , @entity48 notes that gay youth are three times more likely to partake in substance abuse , and that adolescents who said they felt stigmatized -- for example , in the form of family rejection -- are five times more likely to experience depression			1
still , this is an area that , unfortunately , has not been well studied			0
on the rare occasions that this link is discussed , the academic community has tended to focus on adults			0
but the health effects on young people who are stigmatized is surely as significant			0
my own recent research , published in the @entity71 , drew on a sample of 1,000 gay men from @entity74 , and showed that gay men who reported that they heard statements such as " being gay is not normal " in their youth were more likely as adults to have unprotected sex and to have sex while intoxicated or high			1
the study is among the first to demonstrate associations between stigma induced stress in childhood and negative health behaviors as adults that put them at risk for hiv infection			1
there is already ample evidence to suggest that adult gay men and women experience poorer health relative to straight people			2
opinion : @entity2 ' decision makes no sense for one thing , gay men have been more heavily affected by the @entity105 epidemic than the general population			0
according to the @entity111 , between 2006 and 2009 , gay men -- and other men who have sex with men -- were the only risk group to experience an increase in @entity92 incidence			2
there also is a wealth of data showing that gay men and women are more likely to engage in smoking , alcohol and drug use , and experience poorer mental health			1
a study of 577 gay adults by @entity126 and colleagues at the @entity128 showed that gay adults who experience discrimination are nearly four times more likely to experience substance abuse disorders , while @entity133 and colleagues at the @entity135 noted that compared with heterosexuals , gay adults are 68 % more likely to experience depression and 56 % more likely to experience anxiety			1
@entity140 , a senior scholar at @entity142 's @entity141 , offers an explanation for these disparities through the " @entity145 , " which suggests that these health inequities may be rooted in discrimination , with negative health behaviors acting as coping mechanisms for repeated exposure to stigma - related stress			1
opinion : my take : why my family is quitting the @entity2 as impressionable children we internalize messages we receive about what is right , what is normal , what we are allowed to be -- each shaping our views about our sexual identity and whether we " belong			1
" being exposed to messages that same - sex relationships are not " normal " is damaging			2
these messages set scripts for youth to follow , divide them into normal and abnormal , and arm bullies with justification to harm them			2
as my own research shows , these messages have lasting impacts â € ” sometimes fatal -- on health behaviors as adults			2
the consequences for youth are painfully illustrated by the @entity177 , created by writer @entity178 in 2010 to give gay youth hope that life will be easier as a gay adult			1
@entity178 developed the project in response to the high rates of suicide among gay youth			1
research indeed shows that gays are significantly more likely to attempt suicide compared with heterosexual youth ( 21.5 % vs 4.2 % ) , and that among gay youth , the risk of attempting suicide is 20 % greater in unsupportive environments compared with supportive environments			1
being told we are different at an age when we are trying to establish who we are can be devastating			0
but what if it did n't have to get better ? what if it could be better from the start ? last week the @entity2 sent an important signal to gay youth : you are not different			1
but it is not quite enough			0
the ban on gay @entity11 leaders remains			0
last week , @entity208 chairman @entity207 , @entity209 , withdrew his proposed amendment to provide @entity27 citizens the right to sponsor their same - sex partners for green cards			0
and in june the @entity215 will vote on the @entity216			0
each inequity sends a message to young people that they can expect not to be treated equally when they grow up , setting them on the pathway to lowered self - esteem and poorer health			0
perhaps it is time to examine how we are treating @entity27 's gay youth through that lens			1
by creating equality , we can create better health â € ” right from the start			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity233 .			2

@entity233 : boy scouts allowing gay *members* a good step for health of gay youth
he says studies show stigma drives gay youth to *unhealthy* behaviors with *bad* outcomes
he says discrimination can cause depression , drug and alcohol use , risky sex
writer : kids internalize harmful messages ; gay youths receive many . we must make it better
