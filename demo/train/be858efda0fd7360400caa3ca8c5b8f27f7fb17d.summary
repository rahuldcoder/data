-- by distance , the running of the bulls course in @entity3 is pretty short : just 850 meters , or half a mile			2
but with six , half - ton raging bulls and their menacing horns closing fast , the run can strangely seem like an eternity			0
an eternity of thrills , of bravery and bragging rights , and sometimes , of tragedy			0
the tradition of running bulls in this northern @entity17 city dates back 400 years , and became known worldwide after author @entity18 wrote about it in his 1920s novel , " @entity21 , " also published under the title " @entity21			1
" nowadays the annual @entity24 festival is so popular that @entity3 's population of 200,000 can triple during the eight consecutive days of running , held from july 7 to 14 , at 8 a.m. daily			1
hordes of international travelers , many of them young , crowd in for a chance to watch from the barricades and balconies			0
many even try their luck with the bulls			0
some years ago , i was one of them			0
i made my only run with the bulls and like most who take part , i did n't run very far			0
the bulls are faster , and the runners -- now more than a thousand most days , and even more on weekends -- are densely packed			0
no escape i started close to the beginning of the course , near the top of the @entity48 , the hill leading up from the bull corrals , and then dashed across city hall plaza			2
by the time i took cover , i could n't even get close to the supposed safety of the wooden barricade on my right , because there were already clumps of runners packed against it			0
luckily , the bulls kept going straight and did n't turn right , toward me , i kept thinking afterward			0
others went further that day , among them my @entity17 friend @entity64			1
perhaps because he 's from a farming village and knows more about bulls			2
but for novices and others who do n't know enough , there 's fresh help			2
just days ago , a group of @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity17 bull running veterans published an e-book : " fiesta : how to survive the @entity79 of @entity3			1
" contributors include @entity81 , grandson of the novelist and himself an author ; @entity84 , a @entity86 - based photographer for the @entity87 who 's captured images of the running for years ; and @entity90 , a @entity91 who 's fought bulls			1
their collective advice goes well beyond the most important mantra -- that if you fall to the street while running -- stay down and do n't move , and the bulls will likely step over you			0
i did n't know that rule when i ran			0
it 's possible some others who in the past have been gored or even killed may not have known it , or heeded it			2
because the instinct to get up from the street can come at the worst moment -- just as the bulls ' horns arrive			0
there 've been 15 deaths since records began in 1924 , most recently in 2009 when a 27 - year - old @entity17 man was fatally gored in the neck			1
thousands more have been injured , often hurt when falling or being pushed to the ground by frantic runners			2
on the first three days of running this year , 13 people have been taken to hospital , three for goring - related injuries and the rest having being hurt in falls or collisions			1
of these , three were non-spanish , including a 32 - year - old man from @entity125 who was gored in the right thigh , a 23 - year - old from @entity128 and a 23 - year - old man from @entity130			2
ambulances and medical teams now line the course , and the injured are usually transported quickly to hospitals staffed with surgeons experienced in operating on bull goring wounds			2
seeing red police typically try to make the running safer by limiting the crowds inside the course , and prohibiting those who are clearly drunk or carrying objects , like cameras			0
yet some see red at this spectacle			0
this year , animal rights groups again plan demonstrations decrying the bull running and subsequent bullfights where the animals are killed , in the afternoon			1
campaigners have had success in @entity153 , where the @entity155 regional parliament voted in 2010 to ban bullfights in that region , but their criticism does not seem to have dented @entity3 's event			1
the fiesta is an unrivaled source of revenue for the town , an intense week of tourism worth millions of dollars , and the bull running is just a small , albeit renowned , part			1
@entity3 's city hall says nearly 1.5 million people attended the hundreds of concerts , parades , children 's activities and religious events organized around last year 's celebration of the city 's patron saint			1
yet those eight days included just 17,813 bull runners , some of them repeat participants over several days			1
since my own , short run , i 've returned various times as a correspondent to cover @entity3 's big event			1
and one of my questions has brought an intriguing answer : some international revelers say they 've never read anything by @entity18			1
not a single book , much less his novel that brought fame to this town			0
they 've said it repeatedly , over the years , even in the shadow of the statue of @entity18 , which the town proudly erected outside the bullring			1
for some , the details of his passionate writing are lost			0
but they 've picked up the gist : @entity3 , they will tell me , is a must see : this wild fiesta and this dangerous bull running .			1

@entity211 begins this year on july 7 and is expected to *attract* thousands of participants
the annual event usually results in scores of injuries and *occasionally* fatalities
the @entity17 fiesta was immortalized in print by @entity18 in his novel " @entity21 . "
@entity18 's grandson is among those who have produced an e-book on how to survive the bull runs
