-- few of you were surprised that despite spending more per person on health care than any other country , @entity2 are getting sicker and dying younger than our international peers			1
" this should be baffling but seeing the downward spiral our nation is taking , it 's real no surprise			0
is this our new reality ? " @ @entity15 tweeted			0
the @entity16 and the @entity17 released the report -- titled " @entity19 in international perspective : @entity21 , @entity22 " -- on wednesday			2
the report was commissioned to figure out why life expectancy in the @entity2 is increasing at a slower rate than in other high - income democracies			1
a panel of experts spent 18 months analyzing data from 16 " peer countries " for the report			2
@entity0 commenter stevecray said , " they needed 18 months to determine the problem ! it will take me less than a minute : obesity , sedentary lifestyle , a for - profit healthcare system controlled by insurance and pill - pushing pharmaceutical companies that try to limit preventative healthcare			0
" the panel found that @entity2 lacks many social programs that other governments provide that could negate the effects of poverty			1
" with @entity50 and @entity51 costs ' out of control , ' at least according to some , why would we want people to live longer ? " commenter @entity48 asked			0
" if they waved a magic wand and our life expectancies suddenly jumped to world - class levels , it would break the bank			0
good thing the only measure that counts in the @entity2 is profit			1
" commenter @entity64 said : " countries who mind their business and do not involve themselves in wars every few years can do such things			0
the @entity2 gives millions away to foreign aid ( and ) we get involved in conflicts that are not in our best interests because our politicians are owned by special interest groups			1
" @entity76 argued that social problems can be found on a micro level as well			2
" study after study on individuals that have high longevity ( shows they ) have strong social communities			0
that is the one common factor they all share			0
yet what is the first thing i hear when foreigners visit the @entity2 : ' no one even says hi to you ' or ' people do n't even know who their neighbor is			2
' we are becoming more and more isolated , and it shows in more than one way			0
" @entity98 also placed part of the blame on individuals ' shoulders : " it stuns me that people are n't better about their personal health when they can learn so much from doing maybe a day 's worth of research to see what is good and horrible for you			1
" although the report said not all of @entity2 ' health disadvantages stem from our health care system , readers were quick to point the finger in that direction			1
but @entity116 had a different take : " universal health care ? if you 've got a minor medical problem and you live in @entity121 , great ! if you need open - heart surgery or some other expensive procedure , you get on a waiting list and hope your name comes up before your number is up			1
" the report also talked about @entity2 's obesity epidemic and how our environment may be playing a role			1
several of our readers weighed in on the food culture in @entity2			1
@ rickydepass tweeted : " we invented the term # supersize			0
" " i moved from @entity137 to the @entity2 , about six months ago , " @entity136 wrote			2
" first observation after a visit to the supermarket : fruits and vegetables way too expensive ; cheap products stuffed with fats and sugars			0
in short , if you want to kill off a whole population , slow but sure , i could n't come up with a better strategy			0
