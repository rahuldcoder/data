-- holding off a nice run from " 22 jump street , " the romantic comedy " @entity3 " took the top spot this weekend with a $ 30 million opening			1
that 's great news for @entity8 , the gleeful star and narrator of the @entity11 - inspired ensemble piece , though early estimates predicted the sequel performing closer to the tune of $ 35 million			2
the sequel did n't match the original 's 2012 opening weekend kitty of $ 33.6 million , but the laffer also cost a modest $ 24 million to make			2
@entity19 predicts a strong weekday play going forward , buoyed by @entity24 's strong word - of - mouth and @entity23 rating			2
there 's a couple of great jokes in " @entity3 " where the lone square fella of the @entity30 bachelor party suggests the boys eschew a night of gambling and strip clubs and catch a performance of " @entity35 " instead			1
" it won like eight @entity39 ! " he says when the men recoil			0
whether or not it was a pointed reference to " @entity3 's " fellow new release or not is unknown , but the @entity46 adaptation of " @entity35 " hit a bit of a flat note in fourth place with $ 13.5 million			1
going forward @entity48 fans and older audiences may seek it out as a break from the jarring noise of superheroes and metal machines clashing angrily into each other			0
( though i 'm not sure @entity8 and his vegas buddies would make that bet			0
) but with a budget of $ 40 million , " @entity35 , " which earned an impressive @entity23 vote , still has some major singing to do for its supper			1
meanwhile in its second week of release " @entity67 " nearly had its teeth in the no. 1 spot			1
the @entity70 / @entity69 buddy comedy took in $ 29 million this weekend , bringing its domestic grosses past $ 111 million			0
with a second - week drop of 49.8 % in domestic markets , and a $ 14.1 million pickup in international territories , @entity19 executives should be bumping chests			0
also holding strong is the parent - tested , kid - approved " @entity79 , " which pulled in $ 25.3 million in its second week of release			0
all four aforementioned movies would do well to bow down to month - old " @entity82 , " the @entity84 phenom that dropped just 29.7 % this weekend with $ 13 million			1
the fairy queen will not go gentle into that good night			0
