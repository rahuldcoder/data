@entity0 -- at 23 , @entity2 has never considered herself a social activist			1
but a shopping trip to a @entity6 mall left her so irate that she started a campaign against revealing clothing and has sparked a major debate in the @entity10			1
@entity12 's campaign to persuade expats and tourists to dress more modestly began after she and her friend @entity15 saw a young woman in shorts that they considered left little to the imagination			1
she said many people in @entity22 were looking at the woman , but no one did anything , so she approached security guards and threatened to call the police			1
" we never saw this 10 years ago or even five years ago , " said @entity12 , who began her campaign through a hashtag on @entity30 -- # @entity31			2
" i 'm only 23 but when i was young it was different , " she added			0
" i feel sad for the new generations			0
my nieces when they go to the mall they think it 's fine to look at people dressed like this			2
" it makes me sad			0
in our days people always knew it was wrong			0
it is in our culture and our religion			0
" while wearing skimpy clothing is not illegal in the @entity10 , shopping malls have policies that state knees and shoulders should be covered			1
on returning from the mall , @entity12 discussed the issue with @entity53 and wrote a message on @entity30 , saying " till when will we keep seeing people going against our rules and showing indecent dresses ? " initially , @entity12 and @entity53 had no intention of starting a campaign , just sharing their views with friends			1
however , the discussion grew as the issue touched a nerve with many			0
" i never though that in 10 days i would become a social activist , " said @entity12			0
the campaign has started a debate on how closely foreigners should follow local customs while in the @entity10 , and just what standards of dress are acceptable			1
also on inside the @entity73 : @entity75 elections : ' women need a champion ' local newspapers , personalities and those prominent on social media have weighed in on the debate , calling on the country 's authorities and shopping - mall managers to enforce a conservative dress code			1
some have suggested that tourists arriving at airports should be given a brochure explaining local customs and standards of dress			1
the @entity95 ambassador to the @entity10 , @entity94 , had already made his own plea to visitors before @entity12 and @entity53 began their campaign			1
in an interview with the @entity101 's @entity100 in march , @entity94 said : " the vast majority of expats living here dress entirely appropriately , and i think that most @entity95 people who live here or visit here get it absolutely right			2
some who get it slightly wrong tend to get very bad sunburn ! " but seriously , i think it is really important for expats and tourists to understand the norms of the society they are in , so that is why we , through our embassies in @entity6 and @entity0 work very closely with tour operators , local schools , and the airlines , in particular @entity10 and @entity123 , to run a campaign called @entity125			1
" the issue goes to the heart of what can at times be a clash of cultures			0
more than 80 % of the @entity10 population is expatriate , according to @entity132 , and much of the country 's wealth is built on its foreign workers			1
the country prides itself on its welcoming attitude to foreigners			0
most emirati women wear abayas -- long robes that cover the whole body -- but the expectation for foreigners is more relaxed			2
the government advises visitors to respect local culture by avoiding " excessively revealing " clothes in public places			2
although most of the attention has been focused on women , @entity150 also has her sights on men who wear shorts , go bare - chested or wear clothes that are too tight fitting			2
she said : " we should start in the malls distributing booklets with instructions			2
we need to create awareness and let people know about this campaign and that people here are upset about this issue			2
" we should give a deadline -- from a certain date , everyone will know that if they wear certain kind of dress , the mall wo n't let them in , or maybe give them a fine			1
someone suggested giving them something to cover themselves			2
" also on inside the @entity73 : young upstarts plotting @entity73 art revolution many foreigners , as well as @entity10 , agree that more needs to be done to educate visitors on what is acceptable			1
@entity187 , a 30 - year - old @entity188 who has lived in @entity6 for six years , said : " we are living in a @entity73 country			1
there are things we need to respect about the country and the religion			0
" i 've seen girls that really push the limits			0
it would n't be a bad idea to educate some women to show respect			0
" @entity203 , a journalist from the @entity204 , said : " we have to respect the culture and respect ourselves as well			0
do n't wear anything too short or too tight , it 's common sense			0
" however , she said she would draw the line at shopping mall security guards giving people extra clothes to cover themselves			1
" the campaign is good but they should n't go over the top , " said @entity215			0
" there are more important issues out there that they could do campaigns about -- sick people , children dying , hungry people , not what people wear in the malls			0
