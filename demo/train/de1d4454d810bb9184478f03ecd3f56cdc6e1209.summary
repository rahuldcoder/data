-- a temporary truce saturday between @entity2 and @entity3 provided a precious few hours for hundreds of people , who had fled the fighting , the opportunity to learn whether they had a home to return to in @entity10			1
some would use the time to collect belongings from their homes and the bodies of loved ones who were killed in the weeks - old conflict			1
for others , there was nothing to do except pick through rubble and debris			1
during the 12 - hour humanitarian cease - fire , a @entity0 crew traveled to two @entity10 neighborhoods -- @entity25 and @entity26 -- hit hard by the fighting			1
here , in their own words , is what they saw : from @entity32 : losing a home an elderly woman struggles to scale a mound of rubble and twisted metal			1
" did you see my house ? what happened to it ? " she asks a neighbor who crosses her path			1
" it 's all gone , " he responds			2
" there is nothing left " the two appear small standing amid the massive mounds of debris in @entity10 's @entity26 district , where they quietly and calmly converse about the destruction of home after home in their neighborhood			1
" are you sure ? what about my niece 's house ? " the women asks			2
the whole area is demolished			2
around them , others assess the damage -- in whispered conversations			2
there is no wailing or screaming from anyone over what was lost			2
this is the third conflict in six years for the people of this tiny coastal strip			2
the people in the neighborhood are calm , almost methodical , in their approach to war and its consequences			2
from @entity84 : choosing what to save a family of five stands next to their front door , the only piece of their home in @entity10 's @entity93 neighborhood that remains intact			1
the building 's cinder blocks have been split in half			2
shrapnel has peppered the building 's exterior			2
the damage is just too extensive and is unlikely to be repaired			2
but there is no time to mourn			0
the family is fighting against the cease - fire clock , with only a few hours to gather what belongings they can salvage from the rubble			1
" we did n't expect this			1
everything is destroyed , " one family member told @entity0			1
" we are looking for whatever we can carry before heading back to a un-run shelter			1
" despite the extensive damage to their home , they say they feel lucky compared to their neighbor			0
just a few feet away , a massive crater marks the spot where their neighbor 's home once stood			0
there is nobody there to gather belongings left behind			1
from @entity131 : proof of a life @entity135 doors were blown off their hinges			0
through the gap , i could pick out @entity140 tip - toeing through the debris of his three - story home in @entity10 's @entity26 neighborhood			1
he gently plucked a framed photo from a wall			0
it was a picture of his grandfather @entity149 , the patriarch of @entity151 's sprawling family			0
the old man died long ago			0
but @entity151 appears intent on rescuing his grandfather 's memory			0
then the rubble gave up another treasure , a green plastic folder			0
as @entity158 sifted through it , he discovered the family 's birth certificates and school diplomas			0
for a people caught in the midst of a brutal war , @entity140 , like so many other civilians in @entity10 , is desperate to find any scrap of paper that proves he still exists			1
from @entity170 : through the lens peering through my lens , i see the vista of the @entity10 neighborhood of @entity26 : the anarchy , the rubbish , the empty shell casings and the lingering smoke			1
the scene is one of displaced families , and a strange sense of calm , as they collect whatever fragments of their lives they could salvage			0
then , through the lens , there appears an almost timeless scene -- three women clutching their few possessions , walking through the smoke that pours from gutted buildings			0
they are followed down the rubble - strewn road by a man who is leading a horse			0
a foal apprehensively trails the procession , being lead to safety from the inferno			0
through the seemingly never - ending rubble , across the power lines that bisect the road and the stench of rot , this small quiet procession of will marches before me			0
the image seems almost biblical , if it was n't so clearly a vignette of modern warfare			1
from @entity211 : the rubbish of war a young boy in a yellow shirt carries a plastic bag and walks indifferently through the ruins of @entity26 neighborhood in a pair of dusty black flip - flops			0
his relatives walk alongside , carrying a few possessions bundled in bed sheets and balanced on their heads			1
he stops for a moment in front of me , stares me straight in the eyes , and -- without uttering a single word -- throws a handful of machine gun ammunition casings at my feet			0
my eyes follow him as he walks away , almost begging him to speak			0
but his message is clear to me : he has no room for the rubbish of this war .			0
