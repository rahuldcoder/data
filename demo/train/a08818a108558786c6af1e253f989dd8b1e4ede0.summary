@entity1 and @entity2 's marriage was all but over			1
after his return from @entity6 , they optimistically went about forging a life together			1
they married in 2009 , got good jobs and moved into a nice house on @entity11 , @entity12			1
for @entity1 , the war was the past			1
but for @entity2 , it never faded away			1
even as the years went by and he left the @entity17 , his mind drifted back and the awful memories grew more intense			1
they took control of his dreams and gradually replaced his gentle demeanor with rage			1
@entity1 did n't know what was wrong with her husband			2
but his struggle resulted in her own painful memories			2
reaching for something in their freezer one day , she dropped a bowl of spaghetti sauce on the kitchen floor			2
mistakes ca n't be made , he angrily warned her			2
in @entity6 , mistakes could get someone killed			2
it was shocking to see that something falling could cause so much panic in him , " she said			2
" why did he react this way ? where were all these feelings coming from ? i did n't really have an answer for any of it			2
" in november , @entity1 and @entity2 sat down with me in their @entity11 home			2
they 've come a long way since that tense night in their kitchen			2
still , they insisted their real names not be used in this story and asked @entity60 to obscure their faces in a video interview because of the stigma associated with post-traumatic stress			2
they were afraid his boss and co-workers might recognize them			2
but they wanted to tell their story so that more people would know about a first - of - its - kind clinic they credit for saving their marriage			1
in january 2013 , the couple began getting therapy at the @entity77 and their families in @entity79 , on @entity11 's @entity80			2
a counselor at the local @entity82 told @entity2 that he should check out this clinic that opened in december 2012			1
civilians and veteran clinicians work together the center 's concept sounds simple			2
typically , the @entity82 does not treat family members unless the veteran asks for it			1
but at the center , family members are equally empowered to get treatment , and they can get it with their soldiers in a single , shared space			1
here 's how it works : when a veteran or a family member walks through the front door , the family member turns to the left and is seen by a civilian clinician			1
the service member or veteran turns to the right and is seen by a @entity82 therapist			1
they also have the option to be treated together			2
dr. @entity110 , a psychiatrist and the associate chief of staff for @entity112 at the @entity113 in @entity114 , was among a small group that came up with the idea			2
@entity110 and her colleagues made sure the private side of the clinic was staffed with counselors trained to treat children , she told me			1
" there 's the issue of newly returning service members being younger and having young families -- the @entity82 does not have expertise to treat children , " she said			1
" i always saw that as a need			0
" with their patients ' permission , the @entity82 and private clinicians meet regularly to share details of their respective sessions and devise the best way to treat the family as a whole			1
for example , a veteran who is on a sobriety plan may say in therapy that he is n't drinking but the wife tells her therapist otherwise			0
or perhaps one partner reveals there 's physical abuse in the home			0
knowing more allows therapists to get to the heart of their patients ' problems			1
@entity2 and @entity1 believe this full - circle approach is exactly what they needed			0
after the first session together with a therapist , @entity2 was n't sure he wanted to continue			0
" one of my biggest fears was that this guy was going to dismantle my marriage , " he said			0
" he was going to show me that it was n't worth it or we were n't meant for each other			0
" @entity1 had her fears , too			0
she assumed that by being completely honest about her feelings , she was burdening her husband when he 'd already been burdened enough by war			0
therapy emboldened her to tell him how she felt , and he reassured her			0
" it really touched me to know that while i worried about him , " she said , " he was worried about me			0
" so @entity1 kept gently pressing , making their appointments because , at this clinic , she could			1
@entity181 war veteran encourages patients to get help @entity6 veteran @entity184 can empathize with @entity1 and @entity2			0
as director of the @entity187 for the clinic 's parent health system , @entity190 , it 's his job to get out into the community and encourage veterans , service members and their families to come to the center			1
the job also helps him continue to heal			0
when the 38 - year - old came home in 2004 , he was constantly anxious and arguing with his father			0
" he told me that it hurt him and i needed to see somebody , " @entity184 recalled			0
i was thinking he should go see a therapist			0
finally , after getting pretty worked up about it , i thought , ' oh @entity204 , maybe i should go talk to somebody			0
' " @entity207 helped @entity184 ease back into civilian life , and it strengthened his relationship with his dad			1
he turned to veterans groups for extra help , and that in turn made him confident enough to pursue a career in veterans affairs			1
those jobs led him to his position with the clinic			1
" for these veterans , they feel like i did ; like you 're the first person to ask for help , " he said			1
" i try to say to every one of them who comes in here -- a lot of our peers did n't make it home			0
i know that they would want us to live the best life possible			0
you ca n't live a good life , for some of us , without some professional help			0
" there is no cost for treatment , @entity184 said , because the clinic is supported by a grant from the @entity242 and local partners			1
the average length of time for treatment is three months , he said , but that depends on the individual 's needs			1
some patients may drop in whenever they feel they need to talk			0
by the end of 2013 , the @entity82 had treated 499 patients on its side , according to @entity184 , and the civilian side had treated 92 family members			1
the center tracks patients ' progress in many ways , said its program director , psychologist @entity260			0
when a patient or couple begins treatment , a therapist measures their symptoms using nationally set standards for mental health			1
a patient could be assessed for @entity269 , depression and anxiety			0
couples answer questions about their circumstances and how they feel based on a nationally accepted model for couples ' therapy			0
families seeking treatment do the same			1
at various intervals throughout treatment , these symptoms are re-evaluated			1
patients also fill out surveys , with most showing " a high degree of satisfaction with the services we offer , " @entity260 said			0
because the center is new , he added , it 's still gathering enough data to conduct a statistical analysis that would demonstrate , in concrete ways , its successes			0
for @entity2 and @entity1 , the center has proved its effectiveness			0
they hold hands and talk , finally calm after years of chaos			0
every chance he gets , @entity2 tells the friends he served with that they should do anything they can to get help			0
" i let them know , " he said , " without a doubt it saved my marriage			0

the @entity82 does not typically treat family members unless the veterans ask for it
@entity12 clinic empowers both a family and *warrior* to get treatment separate or together
civilian and @entity82 therapists meet to devise best way to treat family as a whole
