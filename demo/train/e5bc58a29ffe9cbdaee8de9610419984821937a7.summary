-- nobody likes to pay taxes , so can you blame the good folks at @entity5 for doing what they could to avoid the higher rates that kicked in on january 1 ? while the rest of us were donning our party clothes on @entity11 , the legal worker bees at @entity5 were pushing the send button on 10 regulatory filings to the @entity15			1
by the time the ball dropped in @entity18 , regulators had been notified that $ 65 million in @entity5 stock had been granted a month early , helping a cluster of powerful multimillionaire executives trim their tax tab			1
among the 10 who shared that $ 65 million , chief executive officer @entity24 , chief operating officer @entity25 and chief financial officer @entity26 wound up with $ 8.4 million apiece in @entity5 stock			1
@entity24 's compensation in 2011 was $ 16.2 million			1
@entity25 and @entity26 that year made $ 15.8 million			1
even @entity28 would be impressed to see that bosses making that much money were able to catch a tax break for a couple hundred thousand			0
the 10 executives who skirted 2013 's higher rates were not the only @entity34 who benefited from the " accelerated " vesting			1
@entity37 , a @entity5 spokesman , acknowledged there was " a group larger than " the 10 but declined to say how many			1
@entity40 would not comment on who made the decision to grant the shares early			0
the shrewd @entity5 move is hardly unique among rich business executives or even 99 percenters of more modest means			2
it was no secret that higher taxes were coming this year , and taxpayers of all shapes and sizes did what they could to ensure that " tax events " would occur in 2012			2
even environmental activist and @entity56 winner @entity55 tried , albeit without success , to unload his current tv to @entity59 before the new year dawned			0
what makes the @entity5 move distasteful is that it was n't even two months ago that ceo @entity24 was mouthing off in a @entity67 op - ed that he endorsed tax increases " especially for the wealthiest " -- along with a plug to cut entitlements to all you freeloaders out there			1
if you 're pushing the position that the rich should pay more to help fix the deficit , it does n't quite follow to employ a tax dodge , says @entity73 , president of the @entity75 - based public interest group @entity74 " @entity5 's quickie year - end tax shenanigans deprived the government of what it otherwise would get , " he says			1
" so they either cause the debt to go up , or cause others to pay more by the taxes they are avoiding			0
" @entity37 , the @entity5 spokesman , declined to comment when i asked whether it was inconsistent for @entity5 to make a move for its executives to avoid taxes after @entity24 endorsed increases for the wealthy			1
i 've got to hand it to @entity5			2
the firm is a master of the " have - your - cake - and - eat - it - too " brand of politics and public relations			0
one minute , @entity5 is cranking out press releases about its devotion to women entrepreneurs in its philanthropic " 10,000 women " program			2
the next , it is announcing its annual list of new partners that includes a paltry 10 women but 60 men			0
@entity5 was a victim on the defensive when @entity109 , a former employee , wrote a @entity110 op - ed on march 14 , blasting the firm for having " morally bankrupt people " who needed to be weeded out			1
you could almost feel sorry for poor @entity5 , which shipped out a memo reminding employees that their estimable employer had been named one of the best places to work in the @entity119 only weeks before the @entity121 - based @entity109 's " @entity122 " essay			1
by the time @entity109 published a book seven months later , the firm had turned ruthless revenge - seeker , even sharing parts of @entity109 's self - evaluations with the media			2
a " best place to work ? " really ? careful what you say in the press -- and in your @entity133 file -- if you get your paycheck from a @entity5 - style operation			2
the brouhaha over @entity109 's op - ed and book stirred up debate of the " what did you expect of an investment bank operating in capitalistic society ? " type			0
banks are not in the philanthropy business -- even if they spend as much time as @entity5 does talking about its good deeds and famous " business principles			2
" ( " our clients always come first " is famously no. 1 on the list			0
) at @entity5 and other " too big to fail " banks , though , employees walk through the doors each morning knowing that the rest of us will be forced to bail them out again should another crisis ensue			1
we taxpayers provide the insurance policy that they enjoy without ever sending us premiums			0
in october of 2008 , @entity5 got $ 10 billion in taxpayer money from the @entity161 , which it ultimately paid back			1
@entity24 , like other bank ceos , would later make the case that @entity5 was n't " relying on " that government help			2
but leaf through the tomes of some of the regulators who lived through the crisis , and you start to wonder whether our tax - dodging heroes might be out of jobs today if the public had n't fronted a bailout			0
from " @entity177 , " by former @entity179 chairman @entity178 : @entity5 and @entity181 were " teetering on the edge " in the fall of 2008			0
from " bailout : an @entity184 of how @entity75 abandoned main street while rescuing @entity186 , " by @entity187 , former special inspector general to oversee the @entity161 : @entity191 chairman @entity190 " confided that he believed that @entity5 would have been the next to go " after @entity181			0
we need to change the conversation here			0
@entity5 and its too - big - to - fail brethren are banks that accepted welfare and are in debt to @entity198 taxpayers for averting disaster			1
this has n't been about hard - nosed capitalism since those first @entity161 wire transfers made their way into @entity5 ' coffers			0
as for the bank 's recent tax - reduction maneuver , it 's another reminder that @entity5 's management is either clueless about how bad it looks or does n't care			1
sometimes bad @entity209 is a just a cost of doing business			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .			0

@entity5 granted $ 65 million in stock to execs before new tax rates began
@entity214 says the firm 's ceo had endorsed higher rates , called for entitlement cuts
she says @entity5 benefits from the *implicit* *promise* that @entity198 will bail it out
@entity228 : it was *unseemly* for @entity5 to rush the payments to shield execs from new rates
