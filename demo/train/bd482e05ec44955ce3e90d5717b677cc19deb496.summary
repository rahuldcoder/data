-- like many entrepreneurs , i am often asked about the secrets to building a successful career			1
the advice i give is that whether you 're in @entity8 creating apps , or in @entity10 in @entity11 making yogurt , there are many common ingredients for success			1
but everything starts with opportunity , whether it be the opportunity to study , to work , to build something , or the opportunities afforded by a safe home , a stable society and a secure environment			2
these were all opportunities that i enjoyed as a young boy in a @entity25 community in eastern @entity26 , and as a young man who came to @entity28 , inspired by the @entity28 dream			2
sadly , far too many in the region where i grew up will never receive the opportunities that i had			2
in the decade since i began the @entity35 business , dramatic changes have occurred in the @entity36			2
conflict has engulfed @entity38 and @entity39 , forcing millions of people to flee from their homes and seek refuge in neighboring countries			1
when i watch the reports from towns like @entity46 , i see a haunting despair in the eyes of refugees			1
their faces look familiar -- they are just like my aunts , uncles and childhood friends			2
and yet the fear in their eyes seems very different			2
the truth is that although i grew up in their part of the world , i ca n't imagine what it must be like to be forced to flee your home with your family , not knowing if your grandmother will survive the journey or your daughter will ever see home again			2
in the past , the world has risen to the moment and responded to similar crises			1
refugees from wartime @entity73 were taken in by dozens of countries across the world in the 1940s and 1950s			1
similarly , victims of conflict in @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 in the 1970s , and those from the @entity82 in the 1990s , found welcoming new homes in faraway countries			0
with all that in mind , i can not understand why the welcoming arms of the international community have become so feeble and spiritless in the face of the latest crisis			0
last week , at a pledging conference in @entity93 , @entity94 , other countries could only muster a commitment to take in 38,000 more refugees from @entity39 in 2015 , despite the fact that we are currently facing the largest refugee crisis since @entity100 more than 50 million people around the world are now refugees or displaced people , robbed of life 's opportunities by war , persecution and natural disasters			1
so where is the big - hearted response of previous generations ? have our hearts turned to stone ? @entity26 alone took in more people in three days than the international community has offered to welcome in an entire year			1
@entity116 and @entity117 have likewise absorbed enormous numbers			0
these countries , and agencies like the @entity121 high commissioner for refugees and the @entity122 , which do extraordinary work , desperately need financial support to be able to provide the basic essentials for those who have fled across borders in search of safety			1
how can it be that such suffering exists just a few hours ' plane ride from some of the world 's richest capitals ? and how can so many enjoy a life of abundance , and yet , despite our more interconnected world , appear so oblivious to quite how bad things have gotten ? @entity142 starts with us as individuals			0
but the needs in this desperate situation are far too immense for private donors to ever meet on their own			0
governments across the globe must therefore answer the call to action -- just as they 've done in the past			1
it is with this pressing need for action in mind that i have been a strong supporter of the @entity121 's immediate efforts to get winter supplies to refugee camps			1
i am also supporting new campaign initiatives to help advance long - term solutions to the crisis			0
such efforts , it is hoped , will help decision - makers around the world hear the voices of those that need help the most			0
this week , i am writing to the foreign ministers of ten key countries , calling on them to show leadership and deliver on their past commitments			0
it is a campaign i will continue with for as long as this crisis persists			0
and i would urge entrepreneurs from across the globe -- men and women who have already demonstrated their ability to shake things up -- to join in and press for change to address this injustice			1
so , as many of us prepare to spend the holiday season with families , and in conditions that millions of refugees could only dream of , it is time to raise our voices as we seek to jolt our leaders into action			1
this is what it means to have a human heart			0
not to avert our gaze from others ' suffering , but to step forward			0
to lift our voices , and call for our leaders to wake up			0
and to do our duty to these sons and daughters , brothers and sisters who are all part of the one human family			0
as those blessed with opportunity in our own lives , we must restore opportunity and hope to theirs .			0

@entity212 : @entity213 must do more to assist @entity39 refugees
governments must find spirit of previous refugee crises , he says
he calls on other entrepreneurs to join in pressing governments to do more
