@entity0 , @entity1 -- wearing a dark , @entity1 style business suit , @entity4 environmental activist @entity3 sat in - between two uniformed court officers as his trial began on thursday in downtown @entity0			1
the officers stared ahead , unflinching , as 44 - year - old @entity3 scanned the courtroom			1
the head judge ran through each of the charges in @entity1			2
when the court interpreter began translating into @entity14 , @entity3 turned to listen			1
the charges are serious , announced the court : trespassing , damage to property , assault , forcible obstruction of official business and possession of an illegal knife			1
if convicted on all counts , @entity3 faces a maximum of 15 years behind bars			1
@entity3 was captain of @entity29 's futuristic boat , the @entity30			1
the batmobile-esque , $ 3 million boat collided with a @entity1 whaling ship , the @entity33 2 , and sank in january			1
weeks later , @entity3 jumped aboard the @entity33 2 and attempted to make a citizen 's arrest of the captain			1
he was arrested and brought back to @entity1 to face criminal charges			2
in court thursday , @entity3 admitted to all the charges , except for assault			1
" i admit that i boarded the @entity33 , but i believe that i have good reason to do so , " he said			1
" i admit that i fired the butyric acid , but there were additional circumstances that we will discuss in court			0
" prosecutors say the butyric acid burned two crew members of the @entity1 whaling fleet , but @entity29 calls it a harmless , albeit rancid , liquid			0
@entity53 acid is found in rancid butter and vomit			0
@entity3 's @entity1 attorneys have mounted a defense on the assault charge , which will be fought out until the trial ends on monday			1
@entity3 's case is the first time a @entity29 activist has been tried in a @entity1 criminal court in the group 's long - running battle with @entity1 's whalers in the icy waters of the @entity68			2
@entity1 annually hunts whales in the @entity68 , despite a worldwide moratorium on whaling , under the loophole that a country may legally do so if its purpose is scientific research			0
@entity29 , who notes the whale meat then gets sold in @entity1 markets and served in restaurants , calls the science argument a sham			0
@entity29 's @entity83 - based attorney , @entity82 , is in @entity0 for @entity3 's trial , though he is not @entity3 's official @entity1 counsel			2
" this whole trial has been brought about for political reasons , far more than criminal reasons			0
if you look at what @entity3 did , he did n't do anything , " @entity82 said			2
" he climbed aboard a @entity1 ship			0
nobody was in any danger			0
no one was under any threat			0
for @entity1 to act like it 's enforcing a criminal law is a little disingenuous , when you look at what @entity3 did			2
" @entity1 maintains that when its laws are broken , it will prosecute			0
" we all recognize the right of protest , right of demonstration , right to express their views			0
that does not mean you can attack people with force , attack our vessels and crews with their vessels , " said @entity108 , from @entity1 's @entity109			0
a verdict is expected on june 10 .			1

charges against @entity3 include trespassing
he was taken into *custody* in *february* aboard the @entity33 2
