on a road jammed with traffic in @entity2 is a hospital behind very high walls			1
there 's a security checkpoint at the gate and once inside , the guards search all belongings -- checking every bag , opening every zipper and looking through the lens of our tv camera to make sure it 's not a bomb			1
inside the compound are single storey buildings clad in white paint			2
cement pathways connect the low - rise structures that pave their way through a mini oasis			2
trees and garden beds surround the complex			2
brightly colored flowers sprout from the earth -- a stark contrast from the dry , dusty , arid landscape outside these four high walls			2
@entity32 grow up a patio awning where patients sit taking respite -- recovering from their injuries , all sustained through war			2
this is the @entity40 -- an @entity42 - run facility funded by private donors			2
it treats only victims of the war in @entity47 -- civilians and the @entity48 alike			2
the hospital had its busiest month in august 2012 with casualties reaching the highest levels since this war began almost 12 years ago			2

she usually wanted to practice @entity161 , and i often quizzed her little sister with multiplication questions			1
