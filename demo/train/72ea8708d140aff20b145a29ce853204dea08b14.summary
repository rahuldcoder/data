many @entity0 think global warming is a distant risk that threatens faraway places with ice caps and polar bears			1
very few @entity0 link global warming to infectious disease , but that could change			1
as the climate of the northern @entity0 warms , the @entity9 tiger mosquito , one of the world 's most invasive pests , continues spreading northward from @entity14 to @entity15 , while extending its breeding season			1
these changes are happening just when chikungunya , an infectious disease carried by this and other mosquitoes , is rapidly spreading throughout the @entity22			1
pieces are falling into place for a historic epidemic on @entity0 shores			0
if that happens , then mosquitoes might just shift the debate from whether climate change is happening to a more serious discussion on how to respond to the consequences of a warmer world			2
studies by the @entity35 have found that when @entity0 are informed about the broad health consequences of climate change , they are more likely to engage with the issue			1
when what 's threatened are our neighbors , rather than far away polar bears , the perception of climate change is likely to shift			1
when informed about the broad health consequences of climate change , participants surveyed by the @entity44 are more likely to engage with climate issues			2
in the end , disease - carrying mosquitoes do n't care if you are a @entity49 or a @entity50			1
@entity9 tiger mosquitoes are opportunistic ; they breed nearly anywhere			2
unlike most other mosquitoes , they bite all day long			0
nor do they mind having their blood meal interrupted by an attempted swatting			0
they just fly off to other victims and increase the odds of spreading disease			0
arriving in @entity14 in the mid- 1980s , @entity9 tiger mosquitoes spread northward to their ecological limit where annual average temperatures are 50 degrees @entity64 or warmer â€” a boundary that runs more or less through @entity15			1
indeed , @entity15 health officials are monitoring @entity9 tiger mosquitoes in 61 locations across the city 's five boroughs			2
the mosquito is abundant in the @entity72 , area			0
the @entity9 tiger mosquito is also adapting its behavior and is able to ignore the onset of autumn , postpone hibernation , and extend its egg - laying season			1
more time to breed allows more @entity9 tiger mosquitoes in northern latitudes , just as one of the worst diseases they can carry arrived near @entity0 shores			1
news reports on chikungunya picked up their pace last december when the disease first appeared on the @entity22 island of @entity89			2
we know it originated in @entity92 , how the makonde people in @entity92 named it for the contorted posture related to its painful arthritis - like symptoms , that the number of confirmed or suspected cases in the @entity22 has passed 25,000 , and that it is highly likely to spread to the @entity0 mainland			1
there is little or no discussion of the virus ' propensity to mutate			0
although the outbreak is driven by the yellow fever mosquito , which thrives only in the tropics , recent mutations allow the chikungunya virus to be carried 100 times more efficiently by the @entity9 tiger mosquito			1
this new virus strain infected hundreds of thousands of people on @entity113 in the @entity114 in 2005 ; about 255,000 cases were reported			0
many died and thousands experienced high fever and intense physical pain			0
the same strain has caused at least five outbreaks in @entity9 affecting millions , with smaller outbreaks in @entity123 and @entity124			0
unfortunately , just when public health officials should be preparing for a chikungunya outbreak in the @entity0 , the federal budget sequestration reduced funding for research on all infectious diseases			2
global warming is enabling the @entity9 tiger mosquito to spread northward , yet climate policy remains stalled in @entity133 , where some elected officials still dismiss even the reality of the measurable rise in global temperatures since the @entity138			1
the relationship between climate change and infectious disease needs to be a focus of the nation 's strategy for outbreak prevention , preparedness , detection and response			1
public understanding of chikungunya and the broader links between rising temperatures and human health could help change public discourse			0
since the first outbreak of @entity157 in @entity158 , the disease has already spread into @entity159			0
cryptococcosis , a frequently lethal fungal disease formerly restricted to the tropics , was identified in the @entity163 in 2007			0
valley fever and hantavirus are also spreading			0
all have been associated with changing environmental conditions as temperatures increase			0
do we really need to wait until chikungunya arrives in the @entity0 before we initiate responsible climate and human health policies ?			2

***writers*** : global warming does n't just hurt polar bears ; it can help spread disease
***writers*** : chikungunya - carrying @entity9 tiger mosquito 's range expands as nation warms
they say the illness is spreading in @entity22 and is highly likely to spread to the @entity0
***writers*** : we need to act on relationship between climate change and infectious disease
