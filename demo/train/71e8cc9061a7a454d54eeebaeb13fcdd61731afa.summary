-- scientists have captured antimatter atoms for the first time , a breakthrough that could eventually help us to understand the nature and origins of the universe			2
researchers at @entity10 , the @entity12 - based particle physics laboratory , have managed to confine single antihydrogen atoms in a magnetic trap			1
this will allow them to conduct a more detailed study of antihydrogen , which will in turn allow scientists to compare matter and antimatter			2
understanding antimatter is one of the biggest challenges facing science -- most theoretical physicists and cosmologists believe that at the @entity29 , when the universe was created , matter and antimatter were produced in equal amounts			0
however , as our world is made up of matter , antimatter seems to have disappeared			0
understanding antimatter could shed light on why almost everything in the known universe consists of matter			0
antimatter has been very difficult to handle because matter and antimatter do n't get on , destroying each other instantly on contact in a violent flash of energy			2
in a precursor to today 's experiment , in 2002 scientists at @entity10 produced antihydrogen atoms in large quantities , but they had an incredibly short lifespan -- just several milliseconds -- because the antihydrogen came into contact with the walls of their containers and the two annihilated each other			1
in this latest experiment the lifespan of the antihydrogen atoms was extended by using magnetic fields to trap them and thus prevent them from coming into contact with matter			1
the researchers created 38 antihydrogen atoms and held on to them for about a tenth of a second , which is long enough to study them says professor @entity72 , one of the team of @entity10 scientists who worked on the program			1
@entity72 and his colleagues produced a magnet field which was strongest near the walls of the trap , falling to a minimum at the center , causing the atoms to collect there in a vacuum			1
" we could have held them for much longer ... i am just full of joy and relief , it 's taken us five years to get here , this is a big milestone , " @entity72 told @entity0			1
to trap just 38 atoms , they had to run the experiment 335 times , says nature which published the report findings			0
@entity72 added : " this was ten thousand times more difficult than creating untrapped antihydrogen atoms			2
" this will help us understand the structure of space and time			0
for reasons that no one yet understands , nature ruled out antimatter ... this inspires us to work that much harder to see if antimatter holds some secret			0
" @entity109 , professor of natural philosophy at @entity110 , told @entity0 that @entity10 's results were a considerable achievement			1
" at the @entity29 we believe the temperatures were very very high and we understand in theory why antimatter disappeared but there is no physical theory to back it up			0
" antimatter was first predicted in 1931 by the @entity120 physicist @entity119 , who theorized that antimatter is ordinary matter in reverse			0
@entity10 's next ambition is to create a beam of antimatter which they hope will allow them to unpeel more of the mysteries surrounding it .			1
