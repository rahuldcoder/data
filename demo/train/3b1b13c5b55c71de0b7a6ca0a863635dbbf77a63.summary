-- @entity1 was @entity2 's last prime minister			1
now he hopes to become @entity4 's first democratically elected president			0
he is running against @entity5 of the @entity6 , the political arm of the @entity8 , in the presidential runoff election that begins saturday			0
like @entity2 , @entity1 is a former air force officer with close ties to @entity4 's powerful military , " the quintessential candidate of the counter-revolution , " in the words of @entity13 , a visiting fellow at the @entity14 in @entity15			1
@entity1 , who briefly served as prime minister in the waning days of @entity2 's presidency , is one of two candidates to advance from the country 's first round of presidential voting in may			1
the runoff election between @entity1 and @entity5 will decide who will become @entity4 's first democratically elected president			2
on thursday , @entity4 's highest court ruled cleared the way for @entity1 to participate in the runoff after invalidating a law that barred former members of @entity2 's regime from running in the election			1
the ruling came the same day the court dissolved parliament after declaring the constitutional articles that regulated parliamentary elections were invalid			0
despite his ties to @entity2 's rule , @entity1 , 72 , is trying to portray himself as a man of the people			1
in the weeks leading up to the may election , his presidential campaign used all the tools of the internet age to get his message out , with a website , a @entity49 channel , a @entity51 page and a @entity53 feed			1
one of his many @entity49 videos shows him dressed in a black t - shirt , meeting supporters and pinching the cheeks of a cute little boy			0
his campaign posters portray him in more professional attire , in a suit and tie , just a hint of an avuncular smile around his lips and the eyes behind his rimless glasses			0
and his @entity51 page shows off a photo of him as a young man with @entity4 president @entity70 , who won a @entity71 for making peace with @entity73 before he was assassinated for the historic outreach			2
in the decades of @entity2 rule that followed , @entity1 rose through the ranks			2
as @entity4 rose up against @entity2 in january 2011 , the man who had led the country so long that he was nicknamed " @entity79 " shuffled his government ministers one last time , promoting @entity1 from civil aviation minister to prime minister			1
@entity2 was toppled less than two weeks later , but @entity1 remained in power for a few weeks longer , saying he and his government would report to the military council that took control of the country after @entity2 resigned			2
@entity1 himself resigned on march 3 , 2011 , after a brief effort to keep @entity2 and his allies from being prosecuted after their ouster			2
as a result , @entity1 is supported by many of those who lost out as a result of @entity2 's removal from power , said @entity99 , director of @entity101 studies at the @entity102 in @entity103 , who is currently in @entity104			1
his supporters include " the powerful ones , a collection of businessmen and generals , " said @entity99 , a visiting scholar at the @entity14 in @entity110 , @entity111			0
some members of the @entity113 of @entity114 may also back him " because he might maintain the status quo , " @entity99 said , doubting that @entity1 could win a popular vote			0
" there 's no way he would get in without ( vote ) rigging and , if that happened , i think there would be the possibility of another revolution , " @entity99 said			0
@entity99 plays down the chance of that happening , however , saying it would be too dangerous for the @entity113 of @entity114 , given the current volatile situation in @entity4			0
@entity1 has been the target of particular anger from the @entity8 , the country 's venerable @entity129 opposition movement that won the largest share of the seats in parliamentary elections after the revolution			0
in april , the @entity8 called for a mass protest in @entity104 's @entity136 , the symbolic heart of the @entity4 revolution , against the presidential candidacies of @entity1 and @entity140 , @entity2 's longtime head of intelligence			1
both were disqualified from running , but @entity1 successfully appealed the ruling			1
@entity0 's @entity144 contributed to this report .			0
