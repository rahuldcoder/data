-- a federal appeals court in @entity2 has temporarily halted the forced medication of @entity5 shooting defendant @entity4 until a three - judge panel can hear competing arguments from his lawyers and prosecutors by mid-week			1
@entity4 is charged with seriously wounding @entity12 rep. @entity11 in a january rampage that also left six others dead			2
the brief order from a three - judge panel of the 9th @entity17 set a tight deadline for lawyers from both sides to file more detailed legal briefs			0
the federal government has until 5 p.m. pt wednesday to argue the involuntary medication should continue			0
@entity4 's lawyers had appealed friday an earlier ruling allowing prison doctors to forcibly medicate him with strong drugs			1
the appeals judges will decide whether to issue a permanent order that could extend the ban on forced medication , or allow the procedure to resume			1
there was no indication how soon the panel would rule			0
last week , a federal judge in @entity37 rejected a motion by lawyers for @entity4 to prevent prison doctors from forcibly medicating the @entity42 shooting suspect			1
" i defer to medical judgment , " @entity12 district judge @entity43 said in ruling that prison doctors were within their rights to force @entity4 to take mind - altering psychotropic drugs against his will			0
" i have no reason to disagree with the doctors here			0
" @entity43 also ordered that sensitive medical and legal documents relating to @entity4 's treatment for mental illness remain sealed			1
@entity4 has already started receiving the powerful drugs , and lawyers representing @entity4 contend that forcing him to take the drugs against his will violates his rights			0
authorities at the @entity60 in @entity61 , @entity62 , where @entity4 is being held , should have tried lesser restraints such as milder tranquilizers , argued @entity65 , one of @entity4 's lawyers			1
prosecutors responded in last week 's hearing that prison officials acted properly in ordering the medication , which they said was necessary for @entity4 to control his mental illness			1
" this is a person who is a ticking time bomb , " prosecutor @entity71 said			0
" he 's lunged at his defense counsel and spits at her			0
" @entity4 , 22 , is charged in the january mass shooting in which six people were killed and 13 wounded , including @entity11 , in front of a @entity79 grocery story in @entity5 , @entity42			0
a federal judge ruled last month that @entity4 was not competent to stand trial , and he was sent to the federal facility in @entity61			2
@entity4 's lawyers said prison officials held a deficient hearing process and used faulty reasoning in deciding to drug @entity4 against his will			2
for example , @entity4 had no attorney present at the june 14 hearing , the lawyers said in their motion , and officials failed to state the drug and dosage he should receive			2
according to the emergency motion filed last month , authorities had earlier assessed @entity4 as dangerous because of incidents before his transfer to the @entity61 prison : he threw a chair against a door and spat at an attorney			2
however , the reasoning by prison officials in @entity61 for deciding to administer the drugs was to treat @entity4 's mental illness , rather than to subdue any dangerous behavior , the motion said			1
prosecutors had argued in their response that @entity4 received a proper administrative hearing on the matter , and the medication prescribed was necessary to prevent him from being a danger to himself and others			1
@entity0 's @entity117 and @entity118 contributed to this report .			0

last week , @entity4 's attorney lost a motion asking for a halt to the forced medication
but a federal appeals court on *tuesday* temporarily halts the forced medication
@entity4 should have received milder tranquilizers , his attorneys argued
@entity4 suffers from mental illness
