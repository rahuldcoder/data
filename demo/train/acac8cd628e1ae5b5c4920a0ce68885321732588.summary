starting the day off at the beach with your skin smelling of tropical - scented sunscreen can be one of life 's greatest pleasures			0
smelling coconut oil as you swish it around in your mouth before work -- well , that 's another story			2
oil pulling , or placing oil in the mouth to kill harmful bacteria , seems to have caught on recently			1
it 's a controversial practice that takes dedication and time , though fortunately not the 10 or 20 minutes of marathon swishing some sources suggest			0
two sessions of four minutes , as recommended by dr. @entity19 , assistant professor of immunology and medicine at the @entity22 and the founding president of @entity24 , were sufficient for my first attempt at oil pulling			1
the taste itself is n't so bad on the surface , but putting chunky coconut oil in your mouth before being fully awake can trigger a gag reflex			2
luckily , the time goes by quickly , and afterward i admit my teeth felt polished throughout the day , as if i 'd just come from the dentist			0
but what 's the scope ( and scoop ) on this mouth rinse practice ? does it work ? " it 's not given proper credit , " said @entity19 , who was trained in @entity42 , a traditional form of medicine that relies on natural healing , in @entity45			1
she explains that using liquids in the mouth for health purposes is mentioned in two ancient @entity45 ayurvedic texts ( one written in 800 @entity52 and the other in 700 b.c. ) , and the practice is part of one of the oldest health systems in the world			1
oil pulling for oral hygiene is common			1
but before you go racing out to the store for oil , the @entity61 cautions that because of a lack of evidence , they do not recommend oil pulling as a replacement for standard oral health care such as flossing and teeth brushing			1
the texts also claim that about 30 systemic diseases , including headaches and diabetes , can be cured			0
yet there is a lack of knowledge on the science and side effects behind the practice , according to @entity19			1
how it works @entity19 says there are two oil pulling techniques : kavala and gandusa			1
with @entity84 , you fill your mouth with liquid and hold it there for a couple of minutes before swirling it around the mouth and spitting it out			0
the process should n't exceed more than three or four minutes ; it 's repeated at least two or three times			0
@entity96 is the technique of holding the liquid still in the mouth for three to five minutes			0
the liquid is then spit out and the process is repeated			0
in @entity42 , many different liquids can be used depending on the condition being treated and the physiology of the person			2
milk , honey and hot water containing herbs are just some of the other mediums , explains @entity19			0
for daily oral hygiene , she recommends using coconut or sesame oil , which she says have mild abrasive powers and more healing benefits than other oils ( and are less harmful )			2
results can be expected in a few months , she says , with benefits such as reduced plaque , cavity prevention and stronger gums for individuals who already have a healthy mouth			2
for the person with plaque buildup , she recommends a teeth cleaning first for faster results			2
a small study published in 2009 involving sesame oil and 20 adolescent boys with plaque - induced gingivitis found that oil pulling reduced plaque and the bacterium @entity135			1
this bacterium is cited as being a major cause of tooth decay and overgrowth of bacteria in mouth can also lead to gum disease			0
a larger study published in 2013 , also using sesame oil , found similar results , summarizing that oil pulling had a significant effect on plaque and gingivitis			1
for coconut oil users , lauric acid found in the oil can be a benefit			0
it is known for its antimicrobial properties , such as the ability to fight off viruses , bacteria and yeasts			0
how it does n't work @entity160 , professor and chair at the @entity162 , expresses skepticism about oil pulling 's effects on oral health			1
" i am not sure there is any harm , but i have never seen it have any positive effect on my patients who have been using oil pulling or in clinical research that has been published			1
" there is also little research available on the effectiveness of these treatments to cure other diseases			0
@entity19 warns that there can be negative side effects if improper technique is used , including dry mouth , excessive thirst , muscular stiffness , exhaustion and loss of sensation or taste in the mouth			1
individuals who are interested in trying kavala or gandusa to treat health conditions need to review all credentials of @entity42 practitioners before starting any treatment			0
@entity19 says that there are very few trained professionals in the @entity199 as none of the @entity42 schools here are accredited ; only schools in @entity45 provide the proper certifications			1
bottom line ? if you 're just looking for a natural way to boost your oral health , you can oil away without supervision and get about the same benefits as commercial mouthwash			2
just do n't forget to floss .			0
