-- before @entity4 allegedly opened fire on an @entity7 congresswoman , police at an area college he had previously attended were put on alert to keep him off campus , according to e-mails obtained monday by @entity0			1
the e-mails , dated december 23 and december 28 , show that campus police at @entity13 were distributing photos of @entity4 to staffers and night watchmen , adding patrols in an area of the campus they believed @entity4 had visited and searching for videos he 'd posted online			1
the monday release of the e-mails came a day after an attorney for the college defended it in a @entity0 interview for not alerting outside law enforcement about @entity4 before the january 8 shooting spree			1
the attack killed six people and injured 13 others , including @entity34 representative @entity33 , @entity7 , at a @entity36 supermarket			1
@entity4 did not have a record of criminal violence before the shootings			2
" we do n't report people simply because their behavior is odd and strange , " the attorney , @entity40 , said			0
" he had made no specific threats against anyone here at the college or anyone else that we were aware of			0
" however , the e-mails obtained by @entity0 through the @entity49 show that , before the shootings , @entity13 officials considered @entity4 enough of a threat to bolster security in case he tried to revisit the campus			2
in october 2010 , @entity4 was suspended from @entity13 and told he could not return without undergoing a mental health evaluation to ensure he was not a danger to fellow students and faculty			2
@entity4 's suspension occurred after he was reported five times to campus authorities for classroom outbursts			1
college authorities put out the alert after learning that @entity4 may have revisited @entity13 after his suspension , video - recorded part of the campus and posted the recording online			1
" in regards to @entity4 , " wrote college @entity71 commander @entity70 on december 28 , " i will have a photo of @entity4 copied and given to the swing shift crew and have them conduct more frequent checks of the @entity77 , to include the night roving @entity78			2
i will also have a copy given to the facilities crew			0
" five days earlier , college police sgt. @entity81 alerted others to a rambling text video @entity4 had posted on @entity85			1
it was not the video containing footage of the campus			0
" @entity90 happened to find this on @entity85 , " @entity81 wrote			0
" more drivel from @entity4			0
doubt there is anything to it			0
" in another e-mail , a college official asked @entity70 if @entity4 had contacted the school to set up an appointment and if " the facilities guys " have a photography to identify @entity4 if he visited the campus after hours			2
@entity40 said it is campus policy not to report students without criminal histories to outside law enforcement			1
that policy , she said , has not changed since the january 8 shootings			0
" we had a process in place , " @entity40 said , " and we dealt with this student in a reasonable fashion based on what we knew at the time			0
