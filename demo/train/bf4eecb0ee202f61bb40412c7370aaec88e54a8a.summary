@entity0 -- two attacks carried out against @entity3 in recent days , one in @entity0 and the other on the @entity5 , have prompted some uncomfortable questions in @entity7 about racism toward @entity9			1
in one incident , @entity10 , a 17 - year - old @entity3 from @entity0 , was beaten unconscious by a group of teenagers in @entity14			1
he spent several days in the hospital recovering from his injuries			0
on the same day , august 16 , a taxi carrying a @entity3 family close to the @entity7 settlement of @entity20 on the @entity5 was firebombed			1
all six family members were injured , one badly			2
three children , ages 12 and 13 , have been arrested on suspicion of throwing the gasoline bomb			0
seven minors , as well as an adult , were indicted in the @entity0 case tuesday			0
among the charges they face are incitement to racism , incitement to violence and aggravated assault , and motivated racism			1
the youth of the alleged perpetrators and the fact they appear to have targeted their victims because of their race , and in the @entity5 case possibly also as a result of tensions between settlers and @entity3 over land , have shocked many in @entity7			1
some believe an environment of conflict and lack of tolerance have combined to create dangerous behavioral instincts in the youth on both sides , undermining the chances of a peaceful resolution to the conflict			0
@entity0 city councilor @entity58 , who grew up in the @entity59 but has lived in @entity7 for many years , wrote in her blog that " apart from sorrow i can only express my shame that such a thing could happen in my country			1
" in the wake of the attacks , @entity7 prime minister @entity65 issued a strongly worded statement expressing the government 's " complete opposition to racism and violence			1
" but some , @entity58 among them , say this is not enough to tackle the deeper issues at stake			0
@entity10 's cousin , 18 - year - old @entity77 , described to @entity1 how the pair were in @entity14 to shop for @entity79 when they ran into a group of about 50 @entity7 settler youths shouting racist slogans in @entity84			1
@entity77 said they tried to avoid the group , splitting off in different directions			2
" all of sudden , i saw a group of these extremist @entity89 run after my cousin and start beating him up , " he told @entity1			1
" i followed to stop the fight and i was personally beaten as well , but not as much as my cousin , who was knocked unconscious to the ground when he sustained a direct hit to the chest and heart			1
" the beating continued until the police arrived on the scene			0
" i thought that my cousin was dead because i saw his eyes rolled backwards and he looked blue , but a man helped in resuscitating him , " @entity77 said			2
" i have one question , why is this happening ? what did we do to deserve this ? i hope they get the highest possible punishment for this crime they did			0
" an @entity7 ambulance service spokesman confirmed to @entity1 that one of its operatives had helped to resuscitate the teenager , whose heart had stopped beating			1
he said the teenager was taken to hospital but that the lack of visible injuries led medical staff to believe he was suffering from a heart complaint not caused by the incident			0
speaking from his son 's hospital bedside , @entity125 said he was relieved that @entity10 had regained consciousness , and that he did not remember what had happened that night			0
@entity131 spokesman @entity130 told @entity1 an incident of a sexual nature between a 15 - year - old @entity89 girl and an @entity9 @entity7 a few weeks earlier had been a factor in the disturbance			1
the girl had told her friends about that incident , he said , " and that 's what stirred up all of the tension , and then they started walking the streets and cursing the @entity9 and then a brawl and a fight broke out			2
" the indictment filed with the @entity0 court describes how on that night a large group of boys had started shouting racist abuse and " pushing , punching and kicking " some @entity9 who passed them			1
when they spotted @entity10 and three other @entity9 near @entity84 , they started to run after them , it says			2
the accused then beat @entity10 " until he lost consciousness and his breathing and his heart stopped , so he needed resuscitation and needed hospitalization for several days			0
" @entity65 's statement condemning the attacks came five days later , after a weekend in which the story gathered steam in the media			2
" in the state of @entity7 , we are not prepared to tolerate racism ; neither are we prepared to tolerate the combination of racism and violence , " he said			1
" this is something that we can not accept -- not as @entity89 , not as @entity7			2
this is not our way ; this goes against our way , and we condemn it in word and deed			0
we will quickly bring to justice those responsible for this reprehensible incident			0
" vice prime minister and strategic affairs minister @entity186 also condemned the firebombing as a " terrorist act " that ran counter to national values , according to @entity7 's @entity192 newspaper			2
the hate crimes " are intolerable , outrageous and must be firmly dealt with , " he is quoted as saying			0
@entity58 , of the left - wing @entity195 party , told @entity1 wednesday the statements from @entity65 and others condemning the violence are welcome -- but the government seems unlikely to take on the deep - rooted issues behind the attacks			1
she believes the incidents are a symptom of three highly concerning trends			0
" one is a question of racism , which is definitely on the rise in @entity7 and is very worrisome to , i think , just about everyone except for a worrisome combination of extreme right and extreme religious groups , " she said			1
a second is the issue of rising violence in @entity7 , particularly among the younger generation , she said , in contrast to a tradition of low levels of violent crime despite the threat of terrorism			1
the third has to do with a growing number of ultra-orthodox youth who drop out of school but whose highly religious education and upbringing have left them unable to adjust to regular society , @entity58 said			2
" those kids , they leave these schools and they are suddenly exposed to a whole world they have n't seen before			0
they do n't know how to behave , they get involved in drugs or crime , " she said			0
at the same time , racism is also increasing in mainstream schools , she said , in part as a by - product of @entity7 's long history of conflict and the distrust built up following scores of attacks by @entity3 militants			1
she believes more must be done in schools to emphasize the need for peaceful coexistence , in line with traditional @entity89 values , and to warn against stereotyping and violence			0
on a more hopeful note , several hundred people joined an event in @entity84 two nights after the attack on @entity10 to demonstrate against racism , @entity58 noted in her blog			2
@entity260 , an associate director of @entity261 , an initiative of the @entity263 , echoes the sentiment that words of condemnation from politicians are not enough to tackle the problem			0
" with racism rising in this country , and chants and graffiti calling for ' death to the @entity9 ' becoming a distressingly common event , it is clear that such reactive public statements are not sufficient , " she wrote in an opinion piece in @entity270 following the assaults			1
" not only swift and vigorous action against the perpetrators of such criminal attacks , but also a paradigm shift in public rhetoric , are necessary to halt the trend			0
" the responses posted below her piece attest to the divisive nature of the debate			0
the latest assaults are not the only incidents to prompt soul - searching in @entity7 in recent months			1
a number of so - called " price tag " attacks -- a term frequently used to describe acts of vandalism by radical @entity7 settlers exacting a " price " against @entity3 targets or @entity7 security forces in response to actions by the @entity7 government -- have targeted @entity3 mosques and property			1
high - profile incidents involving intolerance toward @entity313 immigrants , some of whom have entered illegally after fleeing conflict in @entity315 and @entity316 , have also sparked internal debate about whether the country is facing growing racism			2
while some @entity7 accuse the illegal @entity313 immigrants of increasing levels of crime , suffocating the infrastructure and changing the fabric of @entity7 , others ask how a country founded by @entity89 trying to escape persecution can turn against anyone trying to escape danger in their own lands			2
the government is seeking to deport tens of thousands of the migrants to their homelands , despite fears for their safety there			0
at the same time , the thorny issue of whether @entity7 's ultra-orthodox community , known as the @entity340 , should serve in the military or in civil service has come under the spotlight			1
@entity65 's government last month lost its main coalition partner , centrist political faction @entity345 , over failed attempts to agree on an alternative to the law that exempts ultra-orthodox men from serving in the @entity7 army			1
the prime minister had hoped to reach a consensus with the @entity340 , who oppose changes to the law			0
his @entity357 party has traditionally aligned with the ultra-orthodox factions as coalition partners			0
controversy over attempts by some in the @entity340 to enforce a strict form of gender segregation and rules of modesty on females outside of their community also exercised many @entity7 this year			1
the @entity340 , who make up approximately 10 % of the country according to government figures , are the fastest growing segment of the population -- and tensions between @entity7 's different communities seem unlikely to go away just yet			2
