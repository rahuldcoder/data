-- no one may ever know for sure whether @entity3 's execution of @entity4 -- in a procedure during which he reportedly gasped , snorted and struggled -- was inhumane , but his family and medical and legal experts said friday the ordeal points out fundamental flaws in the use of lethal injection			1
@entity12 , 53 , was convicted in 1994 for the rape and murder of 22 - year - old @entity15 , who was seven months pregnant			1
he was executed thursday morning at the @entity17 in @entity18 with an injection of midazolam , a sedative , and hydromorphone , an analgesic			2
@entity25 reporter @entity24 witnessed the event , his 19th			2
" this one was different , " he said in a posting on the newspaper 's website			1
" after three to four minutes , @entity4 began gasping for breath , his stomach and chest were compressing deeply , he was making a snorting sound , almost a choking sound at times			0
" and i did n't notice it at first , but his left hand -- which had been waving at his kids -- had clenched into a fist			0
" for about 10 minutes , @entity12 appeared to be straining against his restraints , @entity24 recalled			1
" obviously , he could n't get up , but he appeared to be trying to get up or at least raise up in some fashion			0
" such a response should never have happened , according to @entity43 , a lawyer representing the killer 's family			1
@entity12 's children , @entity47 and @entity12 , were among the witnesses			1
controversial execution in @entity3 uses new drug combination " before the execution , there was a series of experts who testified in federal court that this is a possible to likely outcome to that procedure , " @entity43 told reporters			1
he said the family plans to file a lawsuit next week in federal court seeking an injunction against the state 's use of the drug combination , alleging that it represents cruel and unusual punishment and , as such , violates the @entity67 to the @entity68			1
" the family will be satisfied if this process stops , " @entity43 said			1
" that is their goal			0
" @entity74 , a professor at the @entity75 and the @entity76 , said in a telephone interview that such a suit would be " groundbreaking			1
" but , he added , the family did not appear to have the standing needed to file it			1
the family 's concern that other people should not have to endure such treatment makes " a nice political statement , " @entity87 said , but may not be enough to file a claim related to the fait accompli			1
" it 's done , " he noted			1
" there 's nothing to enjoin			1
" @entity94 , an expert on the death penalty at @entity96 , was sympathetic to the family			1
" what happened to @entity4 is consistent with what a number of prominent medical experts said would happen , " she said			0
but lawyers for @entity12 's relatives need not prove he suffered to show cruel and unusual punishment , she said			1
knowledge that there was a risk the procedure could have been faulty might suffice , she said			0
also , autopsy results might show evidence he did not receive enough sedative to render him unconscious , she said			0
" @entity3 will have to review this new procedure they 've put in place , " said @entity113 , executive director of the @entity114 , about the drug combination that was used for the first time on @entity12			1
" i think , now , the judges are going to ask more of the state and not just assume that they have it right			0
" @entity113 , who opposes the death penalty , called the event " an embarrassment " for @entity3 , but acknowledged it was not clear whether the movements witnessed by @entity24 and @entity12 's relatives as well as relatives of the murdered woman were involuntary physical responses or a response to suffering			1
previously , @entity3 used a single drug , pentobarbital , for many of its executions , but the manufacturer has said it did not want its product to be used in executions and the state 's stockpiles of the drug had expired , @entity113 said			1
the backup two - drug alternative was originally intended for use only in cases where a vein could not be found , he said			1
a similar response came from the maker of propofol when @entity150 considered using the drug linked to the death of @entity153 in an execution			2
@entity150 gave back its supply			0
as different states begin to use different drug combinations , " some of this is a bit of an experiment , " @entity113 said			0
but what happened thursday was no experiment , a word that has a specific meaning among scientists , said dr. @entity166 , assistant professor of anesthesiology and surgery at @entity169 , who pointed out that he was not speaking for his employer			0
" there is no monitoring @entity175 , no ethical oversight , no gathering of data , " he said in a telephone interview			0
" this is just the state -- with the decision that it 's going to execute someone -- taking compounds and giving them to people and then seeing what happens			2
and then that 's all			2
" he said he was puzzled over how the court -- " with a shrug of its shoulder " -- could allow the possibility of cruelty taking place			0
though he , too , acknowledged that no one can be certain whether the execution caused pain and suffering , " we can only surmise			2
" the description of @entity12 's final moments " sounds like suffering to me , " he said			1
" all you have is how it looks and this one did n't look very good , by all accounts			0
" @entity166 accused the state of " playing doctor , and playing it poorly			0
" the problem had nothing to do with what drugs may have been used and everything to do with how they were used			0
" none of these compounds are intended for the purpose of executing people , " he said			0
" the compounds used by @entity3 are in short supply , and their diversion from use in treating people to use in execution is questionable , he said			2
" it 's hard to imagine that that 's ethically justifiable , " he said			2
dr. @entity227 , who has studied lethal injections , agreed that executions have been medicalized			2
" we 've turned executions into outpatient surgery , " said the pediatric surgeon in @entity231 , @entity3			2
but the medicalization of the procedure has been perfunctory , he said in a telephone interview , noting that neither of the two drugs used on @entity12 appears to have been tested in animals for lethality			1
" @entity242 tested the electric chair on all sorts of animals " before it was used on people , he said			0
the answer may be to return to the firing squad , which remains a legal way of execution and works surely and quickly			2
" i think they take about 10 seconds , " he said			0
" and prison guards are actually trained to shoot guns ; they 're not trained to shoot drugs -- and the equipment is cheaper , too			0
" but lethal injection is called for by all 32 states that have the death penalty			0
opinion : end secrecy in lethal injections			0

" this one was different , " says witness to execution
@entity12 was convicted in 1994 for the rape and murder of 22 - year - old @entity15
@entity271 's family say they will file suit next week to stop any such executions in the future
lawyer questions whether they have the standing to do so
