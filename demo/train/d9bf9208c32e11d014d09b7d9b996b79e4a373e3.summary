@entity0 -- as the snow falls and the wind bites on a stark winter 's day in @entity0 , a lady rugged up in a green woolen overcoat and scarf arrives at a church nestled among shops and office buildings			1
@entity10 comes in from the cold and greets me with a warm and gentle smile			2
she shakes my hand - her gold wedding band still on display			0
it 's not her real name but she ca n't afford to reveal her true identity : she believes that would place her family in serious danger and she 's lost far too much already			0
it 's almost two years since she found her husband , @entity24 , foaming at the mouth in the @entity27 city of @entity28 on the @entity30 border			1
the 46 - year - old father of two had been working as a missionary , helping @entity30 defectors escape across the border			1
@entity10 was living in the border city as well , helping her husband			1
she had just spoken to her husband 15 minutes earlier			0
" he told me he was meeting a @entity30 defector and would then come home			2
a short time later i got a call from one of his colleagues who said ( my husband ) collapsed on the street and he told me to rush to the hospital , " she said			2
" when i got there he was dead			0
" hospital officials said @entity24 had committed suicide by swallowing pesticides			1
his wife believes he was killed by a @entity30 agent			1
" my husband was aware of the risk			0
people around us were telling us that it is a dangerous job because @entity30 government will severely deal with people who helped @entity30 defect , " she said			1
defectors describe horror , heartbreak in @entity30 's labor camps " but i did not think that my husband would never come back			1
we never expected that it would cost a life			0
we thought maybe the risk was prison or being expelled from the country by @entity27 government			2
we never thought that it would cost his life			0
" refusing to accept the hospital 's explanation for her husband 's death , @entity10 demanded the @entity27 government conduct an autopsy			1
the autopsy report came back saying there was no poison in his system			0
fearful of a cover - up , she went to the morgue before his body was cremated and collected samples of his blood on a glove and gave them to @entity91 authorities on her return to @entity0			2
the government report on that blood sample , reviewed by @entity1 , revealed levels of poison high enough to kill a person instantly			1
fellow missionary @entity98 said his friend had received threats in the past but nothing could stop him from helping defectors or providing food to @entity30 's malnourished children			2
" mr. @entity24 established a food company and factory in @entity28 and he delivered tofu , noodles , bread and baby milk to @entity30			1
mr. @entity24 provided food and spread @entity113 's word , and so @entity30 was threatened by it and put him at the top of their ' terrorist list ' -- i 'm certain they poisoned him			1
" one man was arrested on espionage charges in connection to the murder and sentenced to four years in prison , but it 's little comfort to his grieving wife			0
" he was too young to die			0
we had so many plans and dreams			0
he was taken away from us ... in such a cruel way			0
" defectors hold little hope for new @entity27 leadership			0
