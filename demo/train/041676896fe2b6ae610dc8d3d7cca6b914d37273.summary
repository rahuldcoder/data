-- it 's been almost 15 years since " @entity2 " held its last meeting , when author @entity4 decided it was time to move beyond @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and their friends from the popular book series			1
but @entity12 has continued to write about adolescent experiences , from first loves to dyslexia and bullying			1
her latest book , " @entity19 , " out tuesday , is told from the perspective of a fifth - grader with high - functioning autism			1
@entity23 is obsessed with homonyms , prime numbers and following the rules -- something her teachers , classmates and single father do n't understand			2
she feels most at ease around her dog , @entity32 , but everything changes when a superstorm hits their small town and @entity32 disappears			1
" @entity19 " is n't the first time @entity12 has included autism in one of her books , but it was a new experience for her to write using the first - person voice of a child with autism			1
below is a transcript of our interview with @entity12 , edited for brevity and clarity			1
@entity0 : where did you get the idea for " @entity19 " ? @entity4 : i would say that it 's been a long time in the making			1
the character of @entity23 has been percolating for a while , but the very beginnings of this story go back decades to the 1970s when i was in high school and college			2
i was fascinated with autism , and i began working the summers at a school in @entity66 , @entity67 , for kids with autism			0
the interest has never left me			0
i minored in special education when i was in college			0
i wrote twice before about kids with autism but never from the point of view of the person with autism			0
@entity23 was the first one , and i just could almost hear her voice in my head , and her obsessions and idiosyncrasies were becoming clearer and clearer to me			0
my editors @entity83 and @entity84 and i had been talking about my writing another dog story			0
we had talked about a superstorm in some way because here in @entity90 ( @entity91 ) , where i live , we were hit incredibly hard by @entity92			0
it was very devastating in this area			0
all of these things came together at the same time -- a dog story , @entity23 and the storm -- and eventually the pieces came together			0
@entity0 : how did you develop @entity23 's voice ? @entity12 : i thought it was going to be difficult			1
when i wrote " @entity103 , " which was the first dog story i wrote , i had to experiment for a long time			0
it was told from the point of view of @entity108 , a dog , and i had to do quite a bit of experimenting with her voice before i settled on it			0
@entity23 's voice seemed to come to me more naturally			1
i think already knowing what her obsessions were , not only homonyms but prime numbers and rules , helped because her interests crept into her voice and helped shape it			0
so it was n't as challenging as i had thought it was going to be			0
@entity0 : @entity23 details her favorite homonyms throughout the book			1
what is your favorite homonym ? @entity12 : i have a lot , because i am just almost as interested in homonyms as @entity23			1
the more different the spelling is for a pair of homonyms , the more interesting it is to me			0
one of my favorites that @entity23 discovers and mentions towards the end of the book is " soared " and " sword			1
" @entity0 : what did you enjoy most of working on " @entity2 " series ? @entity12 : once i found a rhythm and developed the characters , i liked not having to say goodbye to them at the end of each book			1
on the other hand , by the time i wanted to end the series , i really felt it was time			2
i had told everybody 's stories as well as i wanted to , and it was finally time to say goodbye and let them graduate from eighth grade			2
i also wanted to spread my writing wings and try different things , write in different time periods			0
i think we all felt it was time to end the series			2
but i love hearing from adults who read " @entity2 " books as children			1
@entity0 : you worked with other writers on " @entity2 " series after the demand became too great and sent them outlines for future @entity2 books			1
what was that process like ? @entity12 : i really enjoyed it			1
i had been an editor before i became a full - time writer , so this was like putting my editorial hat back on			0
i am a huge outliner			0
the authors that my editors , and i chose to write the other books in the series were people who either i had worked with or the editors had worked with before and we felt that they could continue the voice of the characters			1
we kept the number of other writers very small to try to maintain this consistent voice for the series , and each of the authors had read all of the books in the series up to the point from which they would be writing so they would have the background			1
i trusted the writers we had chosen , and i felt that we worked really well together			0
i almost did n't have a choice , because there is no way i could have written all those books myself ! i felt that this was the best of both worlds because i could n't do it myself , but this was the schedule that @entity205 wanted , so it became what i thought was a very nice group effort			2
@entity0 : what do you think of the status of middle school fiction right now and where it 's going ? @entity12 : it is different from where it was when i first started writing			1
there is more fantasy , more sci - fi adventure and vampires , and i think it 's interesting			2
i have a feeling in a few years , things will take a turn			0
the most important thing is , as long as kids are interested and turn into readers , especially avid readers , i think that 's fabulous			2
most kids become eclectic readers , which is great , and that 's my hope for any reader , to find things that they love and hopefully those will lead them to other things			2
@entity0 : you 've tackled a lot of different issues in your books			1
what are some other things you 'd like to cover in the future ? @entity12 : i would like to think maybe about writing fantasy in the near future			1
i 've touched on it when i write the " @entity248 " books with @entity250 , but she is the one with more of a handle on writing fantasy			2
so to write fantasy , even a light fantasy , would be a real challenge			0
i was thinking more in that direction than touching on another issue , which is not to say i wo n't do it ; i just have n't been thinking about it			0
when i was growing up , some of my favorite books were light fantasy , like the " @entity263 " books , " @entity264 , " " @entity265 " and " mr. @entity266 , " but for whatever reason when i began writing , the stories were much more realistic			2
so , i think it would be fun to tackle fantasy on my own .			0
