women who want the @entity1 to lift a de facto ban that prohibits them from driving have launched an online campaign urging @entity1 females to stage a demonstration by driving cars on october 26			1
" there is no justification for the @entity1 government to prohibit adult women citizens who are capable of driving cars from doing so , " reads part of an online petition on the @entity11 website			1
since saturday , it has garnered close to 11,000 signatures			0
no traffic law specifically prohibits females from driving in @entity1 , but religious edicts there are often interpreted to mean women are not allowed to operate a vehicle			1
one of the first to sign the petition was @entity26 , an economic researcher who told @entity29 she definitely plans to drive that day			2
" i will simply use my car to drive to my normal destination ... driving the kids to the mall or family visits , or even grocery shopping			2
" @entity37 , a @entity1 woman who drove a car when she lived in the @entity40 , said she sees no reason why she should n't be able to drive in her home country as well			1
" i am a capable woman , " she explained , " and this ban is a clear violation of my rights			0
" the issue of women driving in the conservative kingdom has long been a contentious one			2
and while such demonstrations are extremely rare , they have been staged at least twice before			0
in may 2011 , prominent @entity1 women 's rights activist @entity52 was arrested after uploading a video to @entity54 that showed her driving in @entity1			1
she spent more than a week in jail and quickly became a hero to numerous women in her country and across the @entity60			0
it was a sign of just how influential she had grown that on june 17 , 2011 , dozens of women across @entity1 , emboldened and inspired by @entity65 's ordeal , participated in the " @entity67 " campaign by getting behind the wheel , defying the ban , and driving throughout the streets of their cities			1
in 1991 , a group of 47 women protested the prohibition by driving through the country 's capital city , @entity78			2
after being arrested , many were further punished by being banned from travel and suspended from their workplaces			0
a video posted on the october 26 @entity84 website shows @entity85 , a @entity1 student in @entity86 , referencing the two previous incidents as she implores her countrywomen to take to the streets			1
" if you did n't get the chance to participate in 1991 or 2011 , here 's your new chance -- on october 26 , 2013 , " @entity90 said in her video			1
" i hope that a huge number of girls take part this time			0
" in addition to prohibiting driving , the country 's strict and compulsory guardianship system also prevents women from opening bank accounts , working , traveling and going to school without the express permission of their male guardian			0
@entity1 has been moving toward change under its current ruler , @entity111 , who is considered a cautious reformer and proponent of women 's rights			2
in january , he appointed 30 women to the @entity116 , the first time women had been chosen for the country 's top consultative body			0
in 2011 , he announced that women can run for office and vote in local elections in 2015 , and in 2009 , he appointed @entity1 's first female deputy minister			1
all the steps were hailed as significant , but many female rights activists say progress still has n't come fast enough			0
the new petition asks the @entity1 government to present " to the citizens a valid and legal justification " for the ban , demanding authorities should not simply blame it on " societal consensus			2
" @entity37 hopes the demonstration will works this time and that @entity1 women will finally gain the right to drive			1
if it does n't , she said , she wo n't give up			0
" i wo n't stop demanding that right over and over again , " she said .			0
