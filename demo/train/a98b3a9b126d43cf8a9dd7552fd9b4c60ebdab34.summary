this week , the @entity0 forsook a tradition dating back to the 1800s			1
why ? because it 's now too easily confused with the musings of an internet lunatic			2
@entity7 commanders this week announced that they would be getting rid of a rule that all official communications should be in all - caps			1
it 's a tradition dating to the 1850s , when the military used teletype machines that did n't have lowercase letters			1
the change is meant to simplify communication and is supposed to save the @entity0 $ 15 million because it can get rid of a dedicated messaging service and use regular old e-mail instead			1
but we have to think not wanting to sound like you 're shouting at someone who said something wrong on the internet played a role , too			1
the most gentle message can come across as psychotically aggressive when typed in all caps			1
so as the @entity0 transitions , we decided to round up five of our favorite examples of all - cap craziness			1
the @entity32 mea culpa perhaps it 's not a rant , as such			1
( though he 's certainly been no stranger to them )			2
but we had to go with the time @entity32 slammed down the caps lock to apologize , on his blog , for his infamous stage - bombing of @entity41 at the @entity42			1
" i 'm sooooo sorry to @entity46			0
i spoke to her mother right after and she said the same thing my mother would 've said			0
she is very talented ! i like the lyrics about being a cheerleader and she 's in the @entity54 ! ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... i 'm in the wrong for @entity56 ! ... ... ... ... ...			0
. " of course , in the grand tradition of half - apologies , he spends several of his remaining loud sentences justifying the moment he interrupted @entity41 's acceptance speech to say that @entity62 should have won instead of her			1
" beyonce 's video was @entity65 ! ! ! ! i.			0
. @entity66 ! ! ! ! @entity67 but i 'm a fan of @entity69 ! ! ! ... i 'm @entity70 ! ! ! ! @entity71 ! ! ! ! you are very very talented ! ! ! ... i 'm not crazy yall , i 'm just real			0
the bakery flame - out having your restaurant appear on " @entity78 's @entity77 " is bad enough			2
having the host quit on you because you 're too hard to work with is even worse			2
flaming out about it on @entity81 in a series of profanity - laced all - caps outbursts ? priceless			1
@entity84 , in @entity85 , @entity86 , experienced just that last month after appearing on the show with the famously acerbic chef			0
so , after the show aired , the smart thing to do would be to take to social media to calmly explain how your restaurant was misrepresented , right ? or , you can try this : " we do not need this			0
... do not blame @entity96 not afford quality			0
the @entity98 , and now the @entity99 , need to back @entity100			2
" a @entity81 freakout ? wrong you are , apparently : " we are not freaking out we do not care about a ' @entity105 ' i am not a witch			0
f --- @entity110 , @entity111 --- @entity112 --- all of you			0
" believe us when we tell you they were just getting started			0
things got so bad that @entity120 's has since created a new @entity81 page			0
nearly a month later , let 's just say that it 's still not polite coffee talk			0
the @entity126 slam @entity129 owner @entity128 's 2010 open letter to fans after @entity131 left the team for the shores of @entity134 is mainly remembered for another typographical choice			0
his fiery screed was typed in @entity137 -- an @entity139 - reviled font that is sort of hard to read without giggling			2
but it was the single sentence he decided to go all - caps with that makes this list : " i personally guarantee that the @entity129 will win an @entity146 " as you @entity146 fans may have noted , @entity131 already has one title under his belt with the @entity151 and he 's currently in the finals playing for number two			1
the @entity129 ? still waiting			0
i 'll tweet you , babe ok , @entity156 , we get it			1
@entity158 rubs a lot of people the wrong way			0
from the tone - deaf self - promotion to the strident political views , mr. @entity162 has mixed it up with everyone from irreverent sports blog @entity167 to @entity170 's own @entity169			2
so when the pop - music icon caught on to an effort to boycott @entity158 's line of neckties , she was so worked up she had to do it in all - caps			1
" i 'll never go to @entity178 ! i did n't know they sold @entity158 's @entity180 ! if they do n't care that they sell products from a @entity185 , " @entity156 wrote on @entity181			1
then : " @entity186 , who 'd lie like ' his rug ' to get some cheap press ! i cant believe macy 's thinks he 's the right ' @entity195 ' 2 represent their name ! " say what you will about @entity158			0
at least he did n't resort to all - caps in his response			1
" @ cher should spend more time focusing on her family and dying career ! " @entity158 wrote			0
we did n't say it was classy			0
just that it was n't in all - caps			1
drunk hulk is drunk ok , we did n't say they were the worst all - caps rants			1
and it 's hard to top an enormous green rage monster who has knocked back a few too many			2
@entity181 's @entity210 , one of our favorite parody accounts , tweets sort of exactly like you 'd imagine a witty , pre-intervention @entity210 would tackle the topics of the day			0
on government surveillance : " it great government record every phone call ! @entity222 find out what was said when @entity224 ! " on really sad fantasy epics : " @entity225 ! go to your room ! and think about what you done ! " on a @entity235 classic : " if you see man making love to @entity231 and gin at @entity233 ! no sing song about it ! @entity238 ! " his whole @entity181 feed is an all - caps rant			1
and we 're not going to tell him to stop , are you ? what did we miss ? let us know about some of your favorite rants in the comments .			2

the @entity0 has announced it will no *longer* communicate in all - caps
tradition dated back to teletype machines of the 1800s
