@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has a secret			1
amid the olive groves of @entity1 just a stone 's throw away from the @entity9 border , he has hidden away several @entity11 boxes			1
their contents are deadly : a dozen unexploded antipersonnel mines			0
he took one out and brushed dirt off its green molded plastic case			0
it was about the size of a soup bowl and stamped with cyrillic letters			0
@entity3 pointed at a raised black cross on the top of the device			1
" if you put pressure on this trigger , " he said , " it will explode			0
" @entity3 's deadly stash of booby - traps are just a fraction of more than 300 similar devices he claimed he and several other @entity9 volunteers dug up from the border between @entity9 and @entity1 over the last two months			1
@entity1 authorities said the @entity9 army began planting mine fields along stretches of the border earlier this winter			1
the landmines appear to be part of an effort to close the widely - traveled smugglers ' trails that criss - cross this long @entity47 frontier			0
the new measure has added another potentially lethal obstacle to the already perilous journey that has been made by thousands of @entity9 refugees fleeing to @entity1			1
more than 17,000 @entity9 are currently living in @entity1 refugee camps , with hundreds of new arrivals coming every day			1
@entity55 knows the new landmine threat all too well			1
the 25 - year old @entity9 refugee lay mutilated in a hospital bed in the @entity1 city of @entity60			1
all that was left of his right foot was a stump covered by a bandage			2
" i did n't know there were land mines , " he said , while recalling the fateful afternoon earlier this month , when he tried to flee with his family across the border to @entity1			1
" i did n't feel anything under my foot			2
i did n't feel that i stepped on something			0
then i heard a very big explosion , " @entity55 said			1
" i did n't know i had been hit until i saw my shoe with my foot inside it laying close to me			2
" @entity1 doctors were scheduled to operate on @entity55 's stump once again on thursday , to clean fragments from his maimed limb			1
@entity1 officials say at least 10 @entity9 landmine victims have been treated in @entity1 hospitals in recent weeks			1
" any use of antipersonnel landmines is unconscionable , " wrote the @entity87 - based @entity86 , in a report published earlier this month on new @entity9 minefields buried along the borders of both @entity1 and @entity91			1
an international convention banning the use of antipersonnel mines has been signed by 159 countries			0
@entity9 , the @entity98 and @entity99 are not signatories			1
@entity86 researchers who examined the landmines retrieved by @entity3 identified them as @entity99 - or @entity103 - made @entity105 antipersonnel mines			1
though the @entity9 minefields were new , at least some of the landmines appeared to have been manufactured decades ago during the @entity108			1
" the @entity105 antipersonnel landmine was produced in state factories of the @entity103 , " wrote @entity109 , a senior researcher in @entity86 's @entity110			2
" the examples we photographed had stamps on them that indicated the explosives were loaded into the mines in 1982			0
" according to @entity86 , it was impossible to ascertain when the mines were sold to @entity9			1
but possibly as long as three decades after production , the @entity103 landmines were claiming new victims			0
" that is the insidious nature of the weapons , " @entity109 wrote in an e-mail to @entity2			0
" they wait for their victim			0
it 's why 159 countries have banned them			0
" typically , de-mining operations in conflict zones are carried out by experts wearing armor and using specialized equipment			0
but the @entity9 activist @entity3 and his colleagues had none of these resources and virtually no training when they began the dangerous work of clearing smugglers ' trails			1
" activists informed me that the regime planted mines that exploded under pressure , " said @entity3 , who had some prior experience working with other models of landmines while doing his mandatory military service in the @entity9 army five years ago			1
" so i conducted an experiment			0
i dug in a big stick next to a mine , tied a rope to it , and went 20 meters away from the mine to pull it out			0
when i saw the mine did n't explode , i discovered that you have to step on it to detonate it			0
" from that moment , @entity3 said he and several other volunteers started opening up paths through the minefields			1
his de-mining tool of choice ? a foot - long metal kebab skewer			0
" the mines are typically buried 5 to 6 centimeters underground , " he explained , while demonstrating how he probed the dirt with the skewer			0
" you can find them because the earth around them is a different color , after the @entity9 soldiers buried the mines there			2
" asked why he was risking his life digging up hidden explosives , @entity3 had a simple answer			2
" it 's my duty , " he said			2
" if i do n't do this , how will the refugees escape from the regime ? they face two choices , either be killed by snipers and tanks , or be killed by landmines			2
the refugees must have a safe place to escape to			0
" a crackdown on protesters by the @entity9 regime has been going on for more than a year			1
the @entity195 estimates as many as 9,000 people have been killed , while activists put the toll at more than 10,000			0
the violence has forced thousands from their homes , many of them seeking refuge in @entity1			2
after showing @entity2 his boxes full of landmines , @entity3 gingerly carried them back into the underbrush where he had stored them			2
the volunteer de-miner did not know how to defuse the deadly little devices			0
he said he did n't know of any official to whom he could turn over the mines , seeming not to trust the @entity1			2
" i hide them here because i do n't know where else to put them , " he said			0
journalist @entity216 contributed to this report .			0

@entity9 began mining its border with @entity1 a few months ago , @entity3 says

@entity55 's foot was blown off by a mine explosion
