@entity11 and @entity12 are charged with two counts of second - degree murder and one count of attempted murder each in connection with the may shootings in @entity19			1
the 12 - count , 19 - page indictment returned by a federal grand jury in @entity22 also includes weapons charges against the two men			2

both men were in @entity10 working for the security company @entity6 , a subsidiary of @entity6 , the military contracting firm formerly known as @entity6			1
@entity28 agents have arrested both men , the @entity26 announced			0
@entity11 , @entity12 and two other contractors , @entity31 and @entity32 , were involved in the may 5 , 2009 , shooting that left two @entity10 civilians dead and another wounded			1
the men had been hired by @entity6 to help the @entity36 train @entity10 troops			1
the contractors said they were driving their interpreters on a busy @entity19 street called @entity41 at around 9 p.m. when a car slammed into one of their two cars			1
" i immediately thought we were under attack , " @entity31 said in may			0
the contractors got out to help their colleagues , and the vehicle that had struck the car did a u-turn and headed back at them , the men said			2
the contractors fired at the oncoming vehicle			2
" the car was coming at us , " @entity12 said in may			2
" at that point we attempted to stop and immobilize the vehicle and we engaged it in small arms fire			0
and the car did n't stop , it just kept going			0
" the incident spotlights the issue of the role and conduct of @entity69 security contractors in @entity10			1
a similar issue arose in @entity71 after a september 2007 confrontation involving then - @entity6 contractors that left 17 @entity71 civilians dead			2
@entity6 lost its contract there after @entity71 's government refused to renew its operating license			0
the company then changed its name to @entity6 , and it continues to receive multimillion - dollar contracts in @entity10			1
in the wake of the shooting , all four men lost their jobs with @entity6 for violating the company 's alcohol policy			1
the contractors said they had not been drinking and had not had a drink since their arrival in november			0
" we feel that @entity6 wanted to shift the blame from @entity6 itself to these men as if they were acting on a lark , " attorney @entity91 said in may			2
" off duty , with weapons , weapons of their own , and while drinking			0
and i think the intent is to use these men as scapegoats			0
" @entity105 , who has advised the men but has not been formally retained by any of them , did not immediately return a call thursday seeking comment on the charges			0
in a written statement thursday , @entity6 said it had " immediately and fully cooperated with the government 's investigation of this tragic incident and terminated the individuals involved for violating company policy			1
" also thursday , @entity6 announced it has settled seven lawsuits that accused it of crimes in cases not related to the @entity10 shooting			1
the lawsuits accused @entity6 security guards of widespread illegal activity , including fostering " a culture of lawlessness " among its guards			2
a lawyer representing the plaintiffs , @entity129 , said neither she nor anyone else involved in the settlement was allowed to discuss it publicly			0
it was not clear how much the settlement was for			0
one lawsuit , filed by @entity137 in 2007 on behalf of families of several @entity71 killed or wounded in the september 2007 shooting in @entity140 , @entity71 , said that a quarter of @entity6 security guards in @entity71 use steroids and other " judgment - altering substances			1
" the lawsuit also accused the company of war crimes , wrongful death , assault , negligent hiring and emotional distress			0
the plaintiffs included two wounded survivors of the @entity140 shooting and the families of five people killed in the incident			0
