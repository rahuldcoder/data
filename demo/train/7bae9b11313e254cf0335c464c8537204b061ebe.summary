" so what does it feel like ? " " hmmm ... cool i suppose			2
" i did n't know what to say , i had n't been back to @entity5 for 14 years and now , here i was standing by the @entity6 , looking at where i had leaped onto the top of the podium			1
i was the girl from @entity9 , with the biggest smile , winning what was to be her first olympic gold medal			1
i 'm not sure , hand on heart , that i genuinely thought it would happen			2
so much had to come together at the right time and @entity5 was my third @entity19 campaign			1
i knew how easy it was to get it wrong , how narrow the margin is between hero and zero			2
but standing here 14 years on , waiting for a reaction , tears even , felt hollow , it did n't feel like " my place			1
" perhaps too much time had passed -- children , work , another gold medal			2
my colleague rolled his eyes in disbelief , hoping for some sort of " moment			2
" how could i not feel " it ? " was n't it the greatest memory of my life ? was n't it right here that my everything changed forever ? what was wrong with me ? the next day we were out on the @entity46 filming for @entity47 , onboard the mighty @entity48 , the favorite for the prestigious @entity50 @entity5 to @entity52 race			1
motoring out under that iconic bridge , the harbor coming into view , i was instantly struck by how busy it was , everywhere i looked the @entity46 filled with sails			2
did n't anyone here have a job to go to ? so much activity			2
the bustling harbor is stunningly varied in its beauty			1
from the harsh inhospitality of the @entity66 , waves crashing onto bare rock , to the sheltered bays and lush vegetation			2
it 's no easy place to sail competitively			1
you really need to use all your senses to do well out here			2
if the wind shifts , you can really smell the warmth of the city , another slight shift and you can smell the rich pine of the park -- or if the sea breeze is on its way , that all changes again , to the fresh aromas of the ocean			2
even the color of the water can help give clues to the shifting tides , the nuances in shade suggesting depth and movement , all potential aids in beating the fleet			2
on shore , the bustling of humanity can fill your senses			1
the sounds of the city , normality , regular people going about their daily business , lunching at @entity104 in @entity105 ... while you 're out on the water , head down , mind on the job at hand			0
with @entity19 success in the balance it 's too easy to keep that head in the boat , to miss the stunning beaches , the rugged beauty of the heads , but the @entity46 here in @entity5 really is something else			1
you can almost feel the history , the stories and legacy of a fully working city harbor -- for over two hundred years thousands have made a living on the waters of this iconic sheltered inlet , it 's far more than just a place to race			1
i began to open my eyes , to breathe it all in , to remember -- every bay , every beach , each and every rock even , the buildings , the parks , those complex winds and current , the changing colors of the water			0
the waves , those smells and noises drifting across from the city			0
it was a lifetime ago , but i 'd known it all so well			0
it had all meant something			0
all those signs back then had helped me " read " this venue			1
it was so hard to race well here , it was complicated			1
sure , i 'd always loved it , felt energized by the challenge , but i was also fearful -- with so many variables , this harbor could easily trip you up			0
now the memories flooded back -- how i 'd caught the wake of the @entity165 ferry on a downwind leg and surfed past eight of my closest competitors			1
when training we used to stop on the naturalist 's beach by @entity172 for lunch , just because we could			0
sailing past @entity175 's head , beautiful , sandy and empty now , but back then , bursting with spectators , and as i raced past , within touching distance of the crowd , they 'd cheer me on			1
i 'd feel a wave of support from the beaches , " come on the @entity180 ! " from the start of that week i had the lead			0
never confused or panicked , i trusted in my knowledge of the course			0
i 'd learned to read all those signs and now , i was making the calls , and they were paying off			0
while others fell apart , i grew in confidence with each and every day			0
i led until the penultimate race , when it all began to fall apart			1
i was at 16th place -- i had finally choked			1
i 'd always wondered -- would i be one of those athletes ? within sight of glory , one hand on the gold medal and it all slips away ? i came alongside my coach , @entity201			0
i was in floods of tears , i 'd blown it			0
i had let him down , i 'd let myself down			0
he held me , he smiled , and he congratulated me			0
he told me how proud he was , that still with one race to go , i was on the @entity19 podium , i had secured a medal for sure			1
the final race would decide the color			1
" trust yourself @entity212 , you know this crazy @entity46 better than all of them			0
back on @entity48 , we had work to do			1
i had to focus on the now , with lots of filming to get through			0
but motoring back in , the work all done , in the shadow of the @entity6 , the " moment " came			1
it had been right here , the battle for gold , i had been calm , composed , confident even			0
despite the helicopter noise and spectator boats , it had been oddly silent			0
i had an eye on my opposition for sure , but to win here my focus could n't be them -- it was this harbor			1
@entity5 harbor could bite , you had to understand it , expect the unexpected -- and i did			1
by the last lap , gold was mine to lose			0
i held my nerve and crossed that finish line one last time			0
my life had changed , forever .			0
