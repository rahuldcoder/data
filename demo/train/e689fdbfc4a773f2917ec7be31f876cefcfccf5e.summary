@entity0 -- being native - born means never having to think about citizenship			1
those concerns are for immigrants , either those who are in the @entity7 illegally and want a chance to get legal status or those who already have legal status and would like to upgrade to full citizenship and all the perks that come with it , including voting			1
the deeper your roots go , the less likely you are to think about citizenship			1
both my parents , three of my four grandparents and half my great - grandparents were all born in the @entity7			2
so i 've hardly given it a thought			2
i have written about immigration for nearly a quarter - century			2
i want an end to the deportation frenzy caused by the @entity29 administration and a chance for the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants to have a shot at legal status			1
solutions to these pressing problems pivot on citizenship and what it should cost			1
more than border security , temporary workers , employer sanctions or reforms to the process for admitting legal immigrants , citizenship has emerged as the linchpin of immigration reform			1
key @entity47 : undocumented immigrants ' not clamoring ' for citizenship if you pulled together 100 undocumented immigrants and asked them how they feel about citizenship , you 'd probably get 100 different answers			1
some value the chance to become citizens , while others could n't care less and would settle for a driver 's license and the right to travel freely across borders			0
those diverse opinions make it difficult for reformers to know what they should demand in negotiations , what they should hold out for and what they should be willing to ditch if necessary for a deal			1
on tuesday , some @entity70 @entity47 signaled that they might be amenable to a middle - ground option in which millions of illegal immigrants get legal residency but not the path to citizenship that @entity76 are pushing			1
and the signals were flashing all over town			0
they flashed at a hearing of the @entity81 , its first on immigration this session , in which @entity85 @entity84 rep. @entity84 told @entity76 that -- if they put aside politics and forgo a pathway to citizenship -- they would find " good will here in the @entity70 for us to come together , actually pass a pragmatic solution to the current problem that we have , and solve and modernize the immigration system for years to come			2
" legal immigrants : what about us ? another signal : @entity70 majority leader @entity98 delivered a speech at the @entity100 , a conservative think tank , in which he endorsed comprehensive immigration overhaul , minus citizenship , as the " right thing to do			1
" @entity98 even changed his tune on the idea of offering a pathway to legal status and citizenship to illegal immigrant students who were brought here as children			1
he was against it before he was in favor of it			0
and @entity70 speaker @entity114 also signaled a cooperative spirit			0
in talking to reporters before the hearing , he refused to back an earned pathway to citizenship , calling it " a very difficult part " of legislation , but encouraged bipartisan solutions			1
@entity124 : @entity125 or path to citizenship ? a middle - of - the - road solution is the way to go			1
getting @entity47 -- and , frankly , conservative and pro-labor @entity76 -- to support an earned pathway to citizenship would be a heavy lift			1
but it would be a shame to leave this historic moment empty - handed			0
for @entity47 , the politics of this is lose - lose			1
they 'll encounter the wrath of voters either way			0
but they should hold the line and either push back against an earned pathway to citizenship or , as a last resort , do everything they can to make sure that any pathway is not a cake walk			2
why not ? because @entity7 citizenship has tremendous value , and we should n't give it away on the cheap			2
@entity7 - born citizens do n't need an earned pathway to citizenship			2
we get it without effort or sacrifice			0
i managed to be born -- 45 years ago -- at a hospital in @entity162 , @entity163			0
and the rest was easy			0
immigrants in @entity7 : the second - generation story @entity167 uses the phrase " the lottery of the womb " to describe the concept of inherited wealth			2
but it applies to citizenship as well			2
it 's about a lot more than voting			0
it 's about becoming a stitch in the @entity7 fabric and about joining the @entity7 community			0
it 's about knowing @entity7 history and being wise enough to learn from it			0
it 's about knowing @entity187 , even as we strive to acquire new languages			0
it 's about surrendering your allegiance to another country or another flag , and -- as president @entity195 said -- asking not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country			0
what 's in @entity202 immigration plan ? it 's about accepting that with rights come responsibilities			0
it 's about being proud to be part of a narrative that includes the likes of @entity211 and @entity212 , @entity213 and @entity214 , @entity195 and @entity215 , @entity216 and @entity217			0
most of all , it 's about recognizing and accepting that the greatness of this country makes us all look tiny by comparison			0
that 's a lot to think about			0
so let 's give the undocumented legal status as soon as possible so they ca n't be deported by an administration that has shown a knack for apprehensions and removals			1
and yet let 's also make the path to citizenship long enough so those who travel it have time to process it all and difficult enough so that , if they eventually get citizenship , they 'll treasure it			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity242 .			1

@entity242 : citizenship for illegal immigrants is most difficult issue in reform
@entity47 *leaning* toward legal status , he says , but not the proposed path to citizenship
@entity242 : @entity254 should have legal status asap to avoid more deportations
citizenship should be difficult to obtain , @entity242 says
