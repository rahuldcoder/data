as for @entity3 , their miserable competition is over , but they did at least register their first goal , as @entity28 struck to half the deficit			1
in a week that saw striker @entity35 sent home in disgrace , the players refuse to train and two senior officials quit in disgust , coach @entity31 's reign of the national side has now come to an end			2
former @entity3 captain @entity41 will be his replacement			1
@entity8 go through as @entity9 winners and will now face whoever comes second in @entity45 -- likely to be @entity46 or @entity47			1
@entity7 will face @entity48 if @entity51 's side top that group			1
@entity6 2 - 1 @entity3 after a tumultuous week @entity31 made six changes to the side that faced @entity7 , and dropped captain @entity54 from the squad altogether			1
@entity56 : heads should roll for @entity59 farce it was @entity6 who opened the scoring on 20 minutes when @entity63 bundled home a corner after a flap from @entity3 goalkeeper @entity67			1
replays suggested the ball hit the @entity72 player 's arm			2
things went from bad to worse for @entity3 when midfielder @entity74 was sent off for an elbow on @entity76			2
and the hosts doubled their advantage 11 minutes later when @entity80 's cross fell to @entity81 who stabbed the ball home at the far post			2
@entity86 striker @entity85 was finally given a taste of @entity2 action in the 55th minute and he flashed a shot wide within moments of his introduction			2
but in the 70th minute @entity3 finally broke their duck in the tournament as @entity95 ran onto @entity97 's pass before squaring to second - half substitute @entity28 to tap into an empty net			1
@entity81 hit the crossbar after a through ball from @entity101 , and @entity101 himself came close right at the end when he forced @entity67 into a smart save			0
at the final whistle an angry @entity31 refused to shake hands with @entity6 coach @entity105 and he later told reporters : " the over-riding emotion is one of sadness			2
" we would have liked the dream to have continued			0
i shook hands with the players because we have been through some difficult times together			0
we need to be dignified in victory and defeat			0
" i have had a splendid adventure for the last six years , good times and bad times			0
it is impossible to summarize at the moment what has happened			0
" i can not analyze things yet			0
i am not concerned about myself only the @entity59 team and its future			0
good luck to my successor and the @entity59 team			0
i wish them all the best			0
i will be their number one fan			0
" @entity8 1 - 0 @entity7 @entity8 and @entity7 knew that a draw would send them both through to the second round but with @entity48 the likely opponent for whoever finished second in the group , the @entity15 sides set out for victories			1
@entity8 had an early chance to go in front when striker @entity10 sprang the offside trap , only to fire narrowly wide of the post			2
the 10 biggest @entity2 shocks @entity144 had the next opportunity as @entity7 responded but he failed to make contact with the ball from inside the area			1
@entity149 then hit the bar for @entity7 with a thunderbolt of a shot from 30 yards but just before halftime @entity8 made the breakthrough			1
@entity154 got down the left before his pinpoint cross was met at the far post by @entity10 , who powered a header into the net			0
veteran striker @entity160 had an early chance to draw @entity7 level but his free - kick was hit right at @entity8 ' keeper @entity164			1
then @entity165 created a golden opportunity for defender @entity167 , but he nodded tamely wide from the penalty spot			0
as the game entered its final stage @entity8 seemed content to hold onto their slender advantage , and @entity7 could n't find the cutting edge to break them down			1
but at the final whistle both @entity15 teams were through to the second round .			0

@entity8 and @entity7 *qualify* from @entity9 of @entity2
@entity6 beat @entity3 2 - 1 but fall short of second round
@entity3 's @entity2 nightmare ends in defeat
