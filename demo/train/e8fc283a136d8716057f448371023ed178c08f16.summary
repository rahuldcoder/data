@entity0 -- in @entity3 online popularity can sometimes spell trouble			1
@entity5 realized that recently when he was arrested in @entity0 on charges of soliciting prostitutes			0
@entity5 's supporters claim he is being singled out because of his online activities			0
@entity5 , 60 , is a @entity3 - @entity10 businessman and blogger , whose regular musings about issues such as corruption and political reform have made him hugely popular -- he has more than 12 million followers on @entity17 , @entity3 's @entity19 - like micro-blogging site			1
but he has also caught the attention of authorities			0
his arrest , prominently reported in state - run media , is widely seen by @entity3 netizens as part of a government crackdown on the spread of rumors on the @entity29			1
on friday , another well - known microblogger was reported to have been detained			2
@entity31 was being held on charges of mis - stating his company 's registered capital , according to a statement from his lawyer reported by the @entity37			2
@entity3 has more internet users than any other country , with more than 500 million people online , and an estimated 300 million microblog users			1
although the services are censored -- with sensitive terms blocked and posts deleted -- the speed with which information can be disseminated has proven a headache for @entity0			0
while the microblogs have been used to disseminate false information such as extraterrestrial sightings , they have also become a forum for spreading news of scandals , protests and venting public anger at incidents such as the 2011 @entity59 bullet train crash , when the response from authorities was heavily criticized online			1
after that incident , which focused public opinion against authorities , a senior @entity0 official visited the headquarters of @entity67 and urged the internet firm to curb the spread of " false information			1
" counting re-tweets since then the authorities have even quantified what constitutes such a crime			0
" internet users who share false information that is defamatory or harms the national interest face up to three years in prison if their posts are viewed 5,000 times or forwarded 500 times , under a judicial interpretation released on monday , " the state - run @entity75 reported this week			1
if a netizen posts a single message deemed as slanderous , for instance , and it 's viewed more than 5,000 times , or re-tweeted or shared more than 500 times , it may be considered as a " serious case " punishable under @entity3 's libel law			1
the authorities have not been slow to take action			0
last month @entity0 police closed down an internet marketing company and arrested four of its employees for publishing posts attacking @entity97 , a " selfless " @entity98 soldier who became the subject of an official propaganda campaign after his death more than four decades ago			1
the police said the company , @entity102 , has long used salacious and provocative posts about public figures and institutions to " rock " the @entity29 and drive traffic to certain sites , the @entity37 reported			0
earlier this year , journalist @entity109 was arrested after publicly accusing a senior official of negligence			0
prior to his detention , @entity109 used his real @entity17 account to make repeated allegations against @entity115 , deputy director of the @entity116 and former vice-mayor of @entity118 , a bustling metropolis in southwest @entity3			1
the police have said only that @entity109 was suspected of fabricating and spreading rumors			0
persecution according to @entity124 , a senior researcher with @entity125 , @entity3 's state media may say the campaign is aimed at combating fraud , hoaxes and defamation , but in reality " it is more a political persecution of critics of the party and the government			1
" but why the crackdown now ? it is prompted in large part by the uncertainty caused by @entity3 's slowing economic growth and by the current leadership transition in @entity3 , said @entity142 , founder and editor of @entity144 , a @entity3 - focused blog and media research firm			1
" these factors have caused the party to return to the @entity150 tactic of stepping up information controls , and to the @entity153 practice of asking ' who are our enemies ? ' and ' who are our friends ? ' which is why some social media personalities now find themselves in trouble , " he said			0
shaping opinions another factor is that @entity3 's massive @entity29 - savvy population consists mostly of young people who go online for online games , e-commerce and social networking			1
each day , tens of millions of people use micro-blogging services such as @entity17 to share information			0
among them are celebrity bloggers like @entity173 € ” business tycoons , movie stars , writers and commentatorsâ € ” who have millions of " followers , " giving them enormous influence in shaping the opinions of such a large and mobile population -- a real worry for the @entity0 government anxious to avoid an erosion of its control			1
as a result -- no doubt influenced by the online whistle blowers exposing official malfeasance -- the new administration of president @entity189 is pursuing an anti-corruption campaign , vowing to target those who put the party and state in jeopardy			1
" @entity189 was forced to accelerate the drive by a steady drum beat of @entity29 revelations that forced the regime to sack and try a series of mid-level officials to demonstrate to a deeply cynical public that it was willing to act against rampant corruption and arrogance of power , " said @entity195 , author of " @entity196 : @entity207 and @entity208 in @entity3			2
" " the contradictory response to the media , bloggers and whistle blowers reflects the regime 's fear that it might be losing control of the campaign , " @entity195 said			2
" it can not afford to let the @entity29 keep driving the campaign			0
it can not lose control over the choice of targets			0
" internet regulation yet even advocates for change accept not all accusations made online are accurate			0
" you have a need to regulate the @entity29 , " said @entity124			0
" there are a lot of unsavory things happening in @entity3 , such as unscrupulous @entity232 companies mounting campaigns against another company just to offer their service to put an end to it			2
but the best disinfectant is sunlight			0
if you have a free press , then these rumors just get dragged out naturally			2
" because many @entity3 citizens do not trust the state - run media to expose any wrongdoings of the party , @entity124 said , they turn to @entity17			1
meantime , the authorities are trying to assuage concerns that the drive against rumor - mongering could muzzle legitimate whistleblowers			0
a recent @entity75 report quoted @entity251 , a spokesman for @entity3 's @entity253 , pledging that " netizens who help expose corruption online will not face charges , even if their posts are not 100 % accurate			2
" still , the campaign may be intimidating some bloggers			2
" when posting on @entity17 , some bloggers joke about it by adding words like ' be kind to me , do n't forward more than 500 times ' , " said a @entity3 journalist who requested anonymity			1
" others are having fun forwarding nonsensical messages , press releases or @entity17 postings from government accounts more than 500 times			0
" " at some point , the government will need to declare victory and pull back , " said @entity195 , a professor at @entity272 who has focused on the issue of corruption in @entity3			1
" so long as it can not control the flow of rumors and charges on the @entity29 , it can not begin to draw the campaign to a close without looking like it is sweeping things under the rug			2

@entity3 government involved in crackdown on the spread of rumors on the internet
they are targeting sharing of false information that is defamatory or harms national interest
bloggers , users with huge numbers of followers , influence under the official *spotlight*
critics believe the crackdown is a politically - motivated campaign against free speech
