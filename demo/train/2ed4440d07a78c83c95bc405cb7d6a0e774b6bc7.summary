@entity0 , @entity1 -- actor @entity3 has a big hockey mask to fill			1
@entity3 arrives on the red carpet at the @entity7 premiere of the new " friday the 13th " movie			1
@entity3 was cast as the iconic boogeyman @entity9 in the new " friday the 13th " movie			1
a remake of the original 1980 film , the new movie aims to breathe life into the former franchise about a psychopathic killer who preys on a group of young people at the fictitious @entity19			1
@entity3 is no stranger to the horror genre , having co-starred in " @entity21 " his career is extensive and includes stints as a stuntman in two of the popular " @entity27 " films			1
he recently spoke to @entity2 about taking a turn as the ultimate evil , the thrill of continuing a slasher legacy and why he 's really not that bloody nice			1
@entity2 : you are n't that scary in person , so what made you think you could be that scary on camera ? @entity3 : i 've got a lot of issues			1
i 've got a whole lot of daddy issues			2
no , i sound like a basket case			2
it 's funny with acting -- we all wear masks in our normal life			2
not to sound like a weirdo in the hockey mask , but like right now i 'm really excited about the film and excited about playing the character , and i will start to speak faster			2
that 's kind of what 's coming over me : " oh you 're , you 're really nice , " but ... on the other side of me there are other @entity56 that are angry , and like i said before , have a little bit of issues			2
@entity2 : tell me a little bit about how you were approached			2
did you know they were making it before they came to you ? was it kind of a shock ? @entity3 : it 's so weird			1
there 's two different versions			2
there 's my version of how it went about , and there 's the producer 's version			2
i 'll tell the producer 's version because my version is really , really long			2
the short version of my version was i heard they were doing a new " friday the 13th , " and i 've never tried to pursue a role before and i went , i really want to do this			1
so when i heard they were doing it , before i even had an audition , i started training for it			1
i found out a little about what they wanted for the character -- that he was n't going to be super , you know bulky or big , that he 's more functional			2
he 's still big , but he 's lean			0
so i started training that way and trying to do what i could just to get an audition			0
on the other end , on the producer 's end , they asked a bunch of different industry professionals			0
they said , " hey , were doing a new ' friday the 13th			1
' who do you think would be a great new @entity9 ? " and my name kept popping up , which i 'm blown away by			1
they brought me in for an audition , and i met with them			0
and they called me the next day and went , " ok , you 're the guy			0
" and i still do n't believe it till this day			0
@entity2 : how did you keep it light on the set ? @entity3 : believe it or not , all the actors ... got along so well			1
i have never been so close to a cast before on set			0
we were just goofing around and playing , but then when it 's time to work and get serious with certain scenes , we 'd all switch over and do our job and get to the point where we needed to			0
@entity2 : had you seen any of the original " friday the 13th " movies ? @entity3 : oh yeah			1
i mean , i 'm a fan			0
i consider myself a fan of the series			0
i already knew all of the originals			0
i had them all on @entity133 , and when i first met with @entity134 [ the production company behind the new movie ] , i told them , " hey look , i 'm a fan of the series first and foremost			0
if i 'm right for the part , fantastic			0
if i 'm not right for the part , that 's ok , too			0
i , just as a fan , want to see a good ' friday the 13th ' film			1
i want to see the series continue so if i can help it , awesome , but i just want to see something good			0
" @entity2 : did you try to model your character after previous jasons , or did you try to kind of take it and make it your own ? @entity3 : definitely make it my own			1
i used the script that @entity151 and @entity152 wrote as a blueprint -- like you would for any acting role where i knew the other guys who 've played " @entity9 " before , and what they 've done , but you kind of shove that away somewhere deep in your brain and build your character from the new script			1
and there are times in the film here and there where i would do little tips of the hats or little homage for the guys who have played him before			0
@entity2 : it 's kind of a dream come true			0
@entity3 : yeah , that 's why i keep saying the words this whole interview like " unbelievable , " unbelievable because i do n't believe it			1
@entity2 : which is funny			0
you do n't usually think of such happiness and glee [ on a horror movie set ]			0
@entity3 : and trust me , you wo n't see that in the final product			1
