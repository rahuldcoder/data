-- @entity1 is out of a job			1
an increasing number of critics think @entity6 commissioner @entity5 , the man in charge of disciplining the star player , should be next			1
the commissioner told @entity10 on tuesday that he was sickened by what he saw on a newly released video that showed @entity1 knocking out his now - wife with a ferocious punch , but insisted that monday was the first time he or anyone in @entity6 headquarters had seen the full scope of the february incident			1
he also deflected criticism of his handling of @entity1 's case and his initial lenient penalty for the @entity25 running back 's act			1
when asked did he really need to see a video of the brutal knockout punch to decide on the length of @entity1 's punishment , the commissioner said , " no. " " what we saw in the first videotape was troubling to us in and of itself , " @entity5 said , referring to another video that surfaced in february after the incident , showing @entity1 dragging his fiancee , @entity34 , out of the elevator			1
" but what we saw yesterday was extremely clear			0
it was extremely graphic and it was sickening			0
" the new footage from inside an @entity45 hotel elevator prompted @entity5 to suspend the veteran player indefinitely			1
it also made many sports commentators even angrier about the league 's botched reaction to the incident -- an initial two - game suspension for @entity1 -- something @entity5 has admitted he did n't get right			1
outspoken @entity56 personality @entity54 called @entity5 an " enabler of men who beat women " and demanded the commissioner resign or be fired			1
" mr. @entity5 's ineptitude has not merely rendered this football season meaningless and irrelevant by contrast , it has not only reduced supporting or watching football to a distasteful , even a disrespectful act , but most importantly it has comforted the violent and afflicted the victim , " @entity54 opined monday			2
" his push to increase @entity6 punishment of domestic abusers to roughly that one - third that of repeat pot smokers , his decision today to suspend @entity1 indefinitely , after the @entity25 had fired him , are elements of classic tragedy , wherein the right thing is finally done only after it 's too late to matter			1
" @entity77 sport columnist @entity76 agreed			0
" @entity5 should follow @entity1 out the door -- his leadership has no integrity and no longer can be trusted by the public			1
he should resign , " she wrote			0
@entity5 told @entity10 that the league assumed an in - elevator video existed and asked law enforcement for it , but was never given the opportunity to view it			1
it was n't until monday , when he arrived at the office and staffers told him there was something he needed to see , that he viewed the video			0
former @entity6 quarterback @entity96 , in a column posted on football by @entity95 , blamed @entity5 for a colossal failure , but did n't call for him to step down			1
he has unlimited resources at his disposal			0
he can make things happen			0
he did n't do his job			0
he failed in epic proportions , " @entity96 wrote			0
in a tweet , the former player wrote of suspending @entity1 indefinitely : " @entity5 made $ 44 million last year to make really difficult decisions			1
this was an easy one			0
" @entity5 has admitted that his initial two - game suspension of @entity1 was the wrong decision			1
he said so when he announced a new policy penalizing acts of violence like domestic abuse or sexual assault			0
the new rules meant a minimum six - game ban , but the penalty did n't apply to @entity1 's case			1
the policy was greeted with commendations , but the fact that @entity1 was going to be back in uniform soon even though the league knew he had knocked @entity124 unconscious drew loud condemnation			2
the criticism intensified after the new video surfaced monday			0
" @entity5 elected himself the league 's top cop			2
is he @entity131 ? " wrote @entity56 's @entity130			0
" did he not talk to the police or hotel security personnel who saw the tape ? " @entity5 told @entity10 that he was n't going to step down and that criticism was an everyday part of the position			1
did @entity6 do what it could to see video ? while the league said it never saw the new video until it was posted online , many question whether the @entity6 tried hard enough to view it before monday			1
@entity143 ran a story tuesday , citing anonymous sources , saying the @entity6 never asked the casino for the video , and had it asked , the video would have been handed over			2
reacting to that report , @entity6 officials said they asked state police for evidence related to the case , but authorities did not give the video to them			1
@entity6 spokesman @entity156 said that security for @entity45 casinos is handled by @entity159			2
in a statement to @entity0 on tuesday , @entity156 said : " any videos related to an ongoing criminal investigation are held in the custody of the state police			0
as we said yesterday : we requested from law enforcement any and all information about the incident , including the video from inside the elevator			2
that video was not made available to us			0
" @entity172 , a former @entity6 player - turned - @entity173 sports analyst , told @entity0 that he doubted the @entity6 was unaware of the @entity143 video			1
the @entity6 should have done more to find it , he insisted			2
" there should have been a way for them to find out , " he said			0
" and if not , well then , they need to hire someone from @entity143 to do the investigative services for them because i think that 's absurd			0
" for them to not make a concerted effort to find out what really happened inside the elevator , it baffles me			0
" former @entity25 offensive lineman @entity189 said that he agrees			0
" they ( the @entity6 ) are just trying to save themselves on this one , " he said			2
" i think they all had an opportunity to see this video			0
" in june , @entity5 met with @entity1 and his wife at the @entity6 office in @entity198 to hear their versions of what happened			1
@entity124 reportedly sat beside her husband as she described what happened			0
after hearing that and taking another month to evaluate the evidence the league had gathered , @entity5 suspended @entity1 for two games of a 16 - game season			1
he also was to forfeit a third game 's pay -- reportedly a total of $ 529,411			0
now @entity1 's career appears all but over			2
after the in - elevator video surfaced , he was released by the @entity25 and was suspended indefinitely by the @entity6			1
he 's not even eligible to play in the @entity213 , which honors @entity6 bans			2
@entity5 , however , told @entity10 it would be possible for @entity1 to make an @entity6 comeback if the running back proved he had addressed the domestic violence issue and that he had paid a price for his actions			1
the commissioner would have to lift his suspension			0
a league spokesman said monday that the commissioner 's office would want to provide direction on any potential new contract			2
players blast @entity5 other players and former competitors have expressed their disgust about the entire matter on @entity233			2
@entity234 on monday tweeted , " 2 games			0
" former @entity6 player @entity237 's message of disappointment was retweeted more than 1,800 times			2
" @ nflcommish to say you got that wrong is an understatement			0
" opinion : lesson of @entity1 case -- stop blaming victim @entity0 's @entity248 and @entity249 contributed to this report .			1
