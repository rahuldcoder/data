did business disputes play a role in the dramatic demise of @entity4 's once powerful uncle ? that 's what @entity7 's main intelligence agency appeared to suggest monday in comments relayed by a lawmaker			1
the uncle , @entity11 , was considered instrumental in @entity4 's rise to power two years ago			2
but @entity4 turned his back on the man once seen as his protector in spectacular fashion earlier this month , having him executed on charges he tried to overthrow the government			0
@entity11 's death was announced in an unusually public declaration from the secretive state			2
analysts have put forward a variety of reasons that may have led to @entity4 's decision to turn against his uncle and to publicize his execution			0
some suggested there may have been a struggle for power between @entity4 and @entity11			0
pinning down the truth may prove impossible for a reclusive regime like @entity34			0
but agents at @entity7 's @entity36 , which broke news of @entity11 's initial fall from power before @entity34 announced it , are nonetheless trying to get to the bottom of the situation			1
the agency briefed lawmakers of a parliamentary intelligence committee monday about what it thinks was behind @entity11 's downfall			1
the head of the agency , @entity47 , played down the theory of a simple power struggle between @entity11 and @entity4 , said @entity51 , a lawmaker from the @entity52 who attended the briefing			1
based on the intelligence agency 's analysis , @entity11 's aides in certain government agencies involved in business projects , including coal and trade , overstepped their authority , creating conflicts with other agencies , the lawmaker said			1
the agency believes @entity4 may have stepped and demanded that the disputes be resolved -- an order @entity11 apparently declined to carry out , @entity51 said			1
that decision may have cost @entity11 his life			0
" @entity11 was purged for violating the supreme leadership , according to the @entity36 report , " @entity51 said			0
@entity34 state media made some references to business wrongdoing by @entity11 in their expansive recounting of his alleged crimes			0
" the @entity81 put under its control the fields and units which play an important role in the nation 's economic development and the improvement of people 's living in a crafty manner , making it impossible for the economic guidance organs including the @entity93 to perform their roles , " the state news agency said in the official report announcing @entity11 's removal from his posts			1
it said he had sold off " precious resources of the country at cheap prices			0
" analysts have said that @entity11 , who was close to @entity102 officials , was believed to have a more open mind about capitalist forms of economic development than hardline members of the regime			0
by discounting the theory of an outright power struggle between @entity4 and @entity11 for control of the regime , the @entity7 intelligence agency said it believes @entity4 's position at the top is stable			1
the regime is still investigating many of the agencies under @entity11 's control , the @entity36 said , according to @entity51			2
it also said that it believed that images that showed @entity11 being dragged out of a large meeting were part of a choreographed event to demonstrate @entity4 's power .			2
