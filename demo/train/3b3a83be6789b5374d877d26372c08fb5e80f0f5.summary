-- @entity1 is really starting to annoy me			1
when @entity1 announced he was running for president back on august 13 , to tell you the truth i got a little excited			1
now i know what you 're thinking -- @entity9 you are a big @entity10 , why on earth would you be excited about @entity1 running for president ? and as @entity12 used to tell @entity13 -- i got some ' splainin to do			1
this was my thinking : @entity1 would get in and he would be a major force			1
after all he was governor of the state of @entity19 , great hair , been around politics for a while			0
he was the bona fide conservative complete with a pedigree to take on @entity25			1
a giant fight to the death would ensue and they would bludgeon each other half to death -- you get the picture			1
honestly , i enjoy nothing more than two @entity34 going after each other			0
secondly , when politics is interesting it is actually good for me			2
in case you have n't noticed , i 'm a cable television commentator -- the more interesting the campaign , the more coverage , the more i 'm on tv -- you get the drift			2
also , as some of you may be aware of , i 've been known to give a speech or two in return for remuneration			2
the people that plan these sorts of things generally hire more political speakers when politics is interesting and in turn i 'll make more money and then @entity58 and @entity59 will start referring to me as a job creator			0
with the way things are shaping up now , the event planners might be more inclined to take a motivational speaker , a magician , or a square dance troop			0
hey @entity1 -- you are costing me airtime and money			1
third , there is a dirty little secret about political people that i 'm going to share with you			0
these political people include operatives , politicians , volunteers , bloviators , journalists , pundits , columnists , staffers -- we actually like politics and campaigns			2
maybe you , like me , are a baseball fan			0
if you are , you want seven games because you actually like baseball			0
the same goes for politics -- if you really love it , you hope for a good race that goes on and you enjoy watching people who are skilled at doing this			1
it is literally painful to watch @entity1 as a candidate			1
the case could be made that @entity1 is the worst debater to ever run for president			1
as far as i know he ca n't even give a good speech			1
his appearance before the uber - right - winged @entity100 was universally trashed			0
not only can he not give an interview , he ca n't even roll out his stupid flat tax plan			2
he steps all over it by saying , " oh by the way , it 's optional anyway			0
" he has managed to couple the flat tax with the @entity108 bureaucracy in one sentence			0
i 'll be blunt with all you perry supporters , it 's time to butter your guy because he 's toast			0
every day it 's a new dumb thing			0
from birtherism , to convoluted tax policy , to inarticulate attacks , to woeful ignorance and even stupidity on foreign policy ( @entity124 country ? please ) , to placing his wife under such stress that she is lashing out at everything around her			0
not only is @entity1 utterly incapable of running for president , he ca n't run his state , and in fact ca n't meet the basic requirement for any politician -- he ca n't even run his mouth			1
as if he has n't made a big enough fool of himself , he decides to go out and have lunch with @entity136 and falls for the birther strategy			1
good @entity139 , can this guy do anything ? i guess i should be fair to him , he has shown that he can get the same people he gave contracts to as governor of @entity19 to contribute to his campaign			2
wow , what an achievement			0
to tell you the truth , it 's gotten so bad people in @entity151 are actually starting to make @entity19 jokes			2
if this thing gets any worse the people in @entity156 will be making @entity19 jokes -- then you 've really hit rock bottom			2
@entity1 , you have managed to embarrass yourself and irritate the hell out of me			1
so i guess you are good at something after all			0
@entity161 : see where the media is reporting that @entity1 is " retooling " his campaign			1
i think their problem is with the @entity166 , not the arrow			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity170 .			1

@entity170 says @entity1 is starting to get on his nerves
he hoped @entity1 would give @entity25 a good fight , *prolong* interest in the race
instead @entity1 has been a weak candidate , with poor *performances* , @entity170 says
@entity170 : @entity1 had lunch with @entity136 and fell for the birther strategy -- a mistake
