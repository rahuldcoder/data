-- misinformation can spread quickly on @entity2 , each retweet exposing it to wider audiences and even resulting in real world impacts			1
on tuesday , hackers took over the @entity8 @entity2 account and falsely claimed that there had been explosions at the @entity11 and that the president was hurt			1
the tweet was up for a few minutes and retweeted more than 3,000 times before @entity2 took the account offline			1
the @entity8 immediately confirmed the news was not true , but the tweet was up long enough to send a shudder through the stock market , which plunged 143 points before recovering			1
real tweets have the power to end careers , cause diplomatic tensions , fuel a revolution and find a kidney			1
fake tweets can have the same ripple effects , and damage control is difficult			2
there is no way to edit or append a correction to a tweet , and once it has been retweeted , those 140 characters take on a life of their own			1
a follow - up tweet with the correct information might not be seen by the same people			2
" you want to respond as quickly as possible			2
deleting the tweet is a good approach , but even if you delete it it 's obviously already out there , " said social media expert @entity40			1
the @entity8 incident is not the first time a tweet has influenced markets			1
in august 2012 , an @entity52 journalist set up a fake @entity2 account for a member of @entity56 's government and tweeted that the president of @entity58 had been killed , causing brief fluctuations in the oil markets			1
the journalist was an experienced @entity2 hoaxer , having previously posted fake tweets about the death of the pope and @entity65 and established a number fake accounts for world leaders			1
he claimed he did it to prove how unreliable social media is for getting accurate news			2
a tweet does n't just trigger financial panic , it can also strain diplomatic relations , as the @entity77 @entity76 in @entity78 found out in april when the official @entity2 account posted a link to a @entity82 segment critical of @entity84 president @entity83			1
in march , someone posing as the @entity77 ambassador to @entity87 tweeted a criticism of the @entity56 presidential election process , which was picked up by the news media in @entity56 before it was revealed as a hoax			0
the @entity77 government responded with official statements in both incidents			0
" the speed at which information spreads is so much quicker than it used to be , and @entity2 is such a big part of that , " said @entity40			0
that was painfully evident late thursday night during the manuhunt in @entity101			0
a tweet mistakenly named a missing @entity104 student as one of the suspects			2
@entity2 latched on to the name and many users assumed it was true even though it had n't been confirmed by authorities			0
a faulty tweet also can have a negative impact on community or a family			0
late last year a @entity115 teenager posted a plea for help on @entity2 saying there was an intruder in her house and asking people to call 911			0
the tweet went viral as friends and strangers expressed genuine concern for her safety ( though no one on @entity2 actually called 911 )			0
but it was quickly discovered that there was no home invasion			0
the teen had run away from home and was later spotted on security cameras buying a train ticket to @entity136			0
the fast - moving , viral nature of @entity2 has its perils , but it can also be used for good			0
@entity2 highlights the impact of single tweets in its @entity142 series , tracking tweets that go viral and result in positive impacts and happy endings .			0

a fake tweet can spread across the social *network* and into the real world quickly
one tweet from a hacked @entity8 account resulted in a dip in the stock market
there is no way to edit or take back a tweet and deleting is *ineffective* once it is in the wild
