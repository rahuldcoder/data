-- @entity1 slapped the @entity3 @entity2 in the face , and the justices just took it			1
on tuesday night , @entity1 executed @entity6 , whose iq score was 61 -- low enough that it should have met any standard for " diminished mental capacity			1
" shockingly , the court did not intervene to stop the execution despite its 2002 decision in @entity14 barring the execution of the " mentally retarded " as " cruel and unusual punishment " in violation of the @entity18			1
@entity6 played a role in the murder of @entity21 in 1992			0
he needed to be held accountable for his actions , even with diminished mental capacity			0
but he had the mental capacity of a first - grader , could barely match his socks and was fired from a car wash job for being too slow at drying cars			2
a clinical neuropsychologist with 22 years of experience concluded @entity6 was intellectually disabled			0
@entity1 got away with executing an intellectually disabled person because the @entity2 allows states to determine their own standards of " mental retardation " and has n't bothered to push back when states clearly ignore its ruling			1
flouting the heart of the @entity14 decision , @entity1 decided that not all persons with " mental retardation " should be barred from execution , just those who " a consensus of @entity1 citizens would agree " whether they should live or die			1
unbelievably , @entity1 had cited the example of @entity45 , the intellectually disabled ranch hand in @entity47 's famous novel written 75 years ago , " @entity45 , " to demonstrate this standard			1
@entity47 's son , @entity49 , issued a statement before the execution : " i am certain that if my father , @entity47 , were here , he would be deeply angry and ashamed to see his work used in this way			1
" he expressed shock that " @entity1 would use a fictional character ... as a benchmark to identify whether defendants with intellectual disability should live or die			2
i find the whole premise to be insulting , outrageous , ridiculous , and profoundly tragic			0
" the @entity62 on @entity63 was also disturbed by the lack of science and the reliance on " false stereotypes " in @entity1 ' criteria			2
in @entity70 , prisoners are required to prove " beyond a reasonable doubt " that they are " mentally retarded			1
" the state almost executed @entity73 , a man clinically determined to be intellectually disabled			2
fortunately , he received a stay of execution , though on other grounds			0
clearly , some individuals who may not exhibit the most severe signs of disability will fall through the cracks			0
@entity1 ' standard leaves more than a crack through which the rare individual may slip			2
@entity6 fell through a gaping hole because of the ridiculous criteria set by the @entity86			2
because the @entity89 failed to pass a law to catch up with the @entity14 ruling , the state 's high court stepped in			2
the @entity3 has not yet arrived at the position that governments should not have the irreversible @entity95 - like power to execute its citizens as the majority of countries in the world have			0
but 10 years ago , the @entity2 at least recognized that there ought to be limits to this awful power			2
the insane , children and those who are not mentally developed are more vulnerable than the rest of us			0
they are more easily manipulated , they are less capable of making sound judgments and they often need help carrying out basic daily functions			0
we treat them differently because we are humane and civilized , right ? the @entity3 @entity2 will receive more cases like the @entity6 case until it stands up to the states and insists that they develop better scientific and reasonable criteria for judging a person 's mental capacity that respect today 's standards of decency			1
the @entity3 just sustained another black eye on the world stage when @entity1 was allowed to execute a man with the mind of 7 - year - old			1
the egregiousness of this act is heightened for a country that claims the moral high ground and global leadership on human rights			0
executing a poor , @entity135 , intellectually disabled man shows once again the arbitrary nature of the death penalty			1
that was why the @entity2 halted capital punishment 40 years ago in its @entity141 decision			0
in @entity143 , the court allowed states to resume the death penalty after a four - year hiatus provided they reserve it for the " worst of the worst " offenders			1
@entity6 hardly exemplifies this principle			0
@entity150 has documented several cases in recent years in which prisoners with compelling evidence of " mental retardation " were executed , and more than 100 cases where prisoners with severe mental illness were put to death			1
again , the @entity2 has failed to hold the states to a reasonable standard despite ruling that the " insane " ( the legal term ) must not be executed			1
capital punishment is an empty symbol and an outmoded practice			0
it is expensive , fails to keep us safe and diminishes us all			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity169 .			0

@entity169 : @entity2 in 2002 barred death penalty for the " mentally retarded "
@entity169 : yet court stood aside as @entity1 executed man who has the mind of a 7 - year - old
states can set criteria for " mental retardation , " and court does n't call them on it , she says
@entity169 : @entity1 set stereotypical standards , citing character from @entity47 's " @entity45 "
