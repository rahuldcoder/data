@entity2 has made it quite clear that his country 's february nuclear test marks a new phase of confrontation with the @entity8 , which @entity15 has described as " the sworn enemy of the @entity3 people			1
" opinion : how to deal with @entity3 yet that has n't stopped @entity15 from welcoming a few dignitaries from this " sworn enemy " nation , including a top @entity24 executive and a few basketball stars			1
no one knows if it 's all part of an organized effort to woo @entity3 into diplomacy by appealing to its leader 's interest in @entity8 culture			1
yet one thing is for sure : this love - hate relationship has sparked some odd stories out of the @entity36			0
here 's a look at some of the most recent ones we 've come across : 1			0
@entity2 : @entity41 's new bff if you read the reports about former @entity45 star @entity41 's visit to @entity15 , you might have double - checked whether the story was just another @entity48 parody			2
not only did the @entity8 basketball star -- known for his over-the - top publicity stunts -- visit @entity3 , but he also was joined by three members of the famed @entity52 , who played against @entity3 's " @entity54 " ( no surprise , the game ended in a tie )			1
@entity41 proclaimed @entity2 " a friend for life , " and appeared courtside with the @entity3 leader			2
not everyone was cheering this so - called " basketball diplomacy			0
" a commentary in @entity65 's @entity64 outlined @entity3 's " monstrous gulag system that @entity41 will never see			2
" and @entity0 contributor @entity67 wrote that @entity41 is n't the only " celebrity to be used for publicity purposes to prop up a dictator			0
" @entity3 issues threat to @entity8 military 2			1
@entity24 executive urges country with barely any electricity to embrace the internet you 've probably seen that @entity80 satellite photo of the @entity81 at night , the one that shows the northern half completely dark while the southern half and the @entity86 coast are fully alight			0
electricity is still a luxury in @entity3 , where cold winds from nearby @entity90 can plunge temperatures below freezing			2
but that did n't stop @entity24 's executive chairman @entity94 from visiting @entity3 in january as part of a delegation urging @entity3 to " make it possible for people to use the @entity77			2
" while many @entity3 might be more interested in having a heated home , @entity94 and his @entity24 colleague @entity100 have advocated about the @entity77 's ability to empower citizens living under oppressive regimes			0
@entity104 apparently are n't the only ones heading to @entity15 in the wake of the @entity94 and @entity41 visits , @entity106 looked at just how many @entity109 are heading to @entity3 for its closely monitored , government - run tours			1
surprisingly , it found a nearly 20 % increase in visits since 2011			0

students , who are mostly @entity120 , say they are learning @entity3 culture and language , and laugh off suggestions that they 're training to be spies			0
dreaming of annihilating the @entity8 , to the tune of ' we are @entity142 ' it 's no secret that @entity3 's propaganda images are bizarre , at least to the @entity146 eye			1
if this does n't make sense , just search @entity149 for " @entity3 propaganda			0
" yet one video released in the run - up to @entity3 's nuclear test on @entity15 's official website still managed to raise some eyebrows			1
the video -- set to the tune of " @entity162 , " the 1985 song written by @entity157 and @entity158 heralding world peace -- shows a @entity3 man dreaming about an apparent missile attack on the @entity8			1
