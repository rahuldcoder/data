-- did @entity1 realize the morning of a 2012 traffic accident that she mistakenly took a sleeping pill ? is she responsible for what happened next ? those are the sorts of questions the jurors in her @entity9 trial began deliberating thursday			1
in closing arguments , a prosecutor accused @entity1 of lying to police and the public in an effort to protect her legacy			1
@entity1 , daughter of the late sen. @entity17 , faces a charge of driving while impaired after swerving off the road in her @entity20 and careening into a tractor - trailer on a @entity24 interstate in morning rush - hour traffic in july 2012			1
she testified this week that she grabbed the wrong prescription bottle off her kitchen counter that morning and swallowed 10 milligrams of zolpidem , commonly known by the brand name @entity30 , thinking it was her thyroid medication			2
" she had a lot on her mind that morning			2
and she took the wrong pill by mistake , " prosecutor @entity34 told jurors			2
" however , it also makes no sense whatsoever that at no point did she realize or feel tired or dizzy or drowsy			2
that makes no sense , " she said			0
" she is responsible for the chain of events that happened after that			0
" @entity46 told jurors that @entity1 had a responsibility to pull off the road safely when she felt the effect of the drug			1
her inconsistent statements about the incident , including the claim that her doctors said she 'd had a seizure , were meant as a smokescreen , @entity46 said : " she knew			0
she knew right away that she had taken the wrong pill			0
and i submit she was looking for an excuse , to avoid responsibility ... to control her public image			0
" in his closing arguments , defense attorney @entity64 told jurors there 's no disputing that @entity1 ingested zolpidem and was " out of it " the morning of the crash			1
" the dispute is this : whether the prosecution has proved to you beyond a reasonable doubt that ms. @entity1 operated her vehicle while she was aware that she had ingested zolpidem and , after becoming aware , she continued intentionally to drive			1
that 's what this case is all about			0
" he continued , " they 're arguing without any evidence that she realized ; she says she did n't			0
there 's nothing to the contrary			0
" a jury of two women and four men began its deliberations thursday afternoon , after four days of testimony			2
they stopped for the day without reaching a verdict and will resume deliberations friday morning			1
this week , jurors watched police cruiser dashboard camera footage of a disoriented @entity1 failing three sobriety tests after a motorist found her slumped over her steering wheel and called 911			1
@entity24 trooper @entity101 , who evaluated @entity1 three hours after the crash , said he thought she may have a medical condition and recommended that she get checked out			1
a worried @entity1 asked him for a vial of the blood drawn from her at @entity106 , @entity101 said : " she was concerned , and she wanted to know what happened to her			1
" @entity1 remained at the hospital overnight for observation			1
jurors also heard from @entity112 , director of the @entity114 @entity113 , who testified that zolpidem is " a very potent , fast - acting hypnotic " that begins to hamper cognitive ability and motor skills within 15 to 45 minutes			0
its effect on @entity1 would have peaked about 9 a.m. , testified @entity120 , roughly the time @entity1 failed the sobriety tests			1
@entity46 asked @entity120 whether zolpidem is a " knockout pill , " and she replied that the drug would need time to enter the bloodstream and brain before it takes full effect			0
a defense expert , clinical pharmacologist and forensic toxicologist @entity131 , challenged that notion thursday , saying the disabling influence could be instantaneous and impossible for a person to self - detect , likening it to the effects of a date rape drug			2
during her testimony , @entity1 emphatically denied feeling the effects of the powerful sleep aid in her system before the erratic driving and told @entity46 she does n't even know what its symptoms feel like			1
" you 've taken this pill for 10 years , and you ca n't tell me whether or not it makes you feel tired after you take it ? " @entity46 asked incredulously			0
" i guess i do n't really think about how i 'm feeling when i take it , " @entity1 replied			1
" i take it , and then i 'm asleep			0
" the jury is well - aware of the defendant 's place in the storied political family			0
" @entity156 was the attorney general during the civil rights movement and then a senator , " she testified wednesday , and said her mother raised the family 's 11 children because her father died when she was 8 years old : " he was assassinated while running for president			0
" matriarch @entity165 , 85 , has attended the trial daily , along with several other relatives and family friends			2
@entity1 is the director of the @entity170 and became animated on the stand as she described her work to fight poverty and sexual slavery			1
she testified that she missed jury selection last week because of a trip to several @entity178 nations , including a meeting with secretary of state @entity180 in @entity181 and another in @entity182 with the president of the @entity184			0
in her closing arguments , @entity46 told jurors that @entity1 's humanitarian work and background are irrelevant : " she is not exempt to the rule of law			1
she is subject to the rule of law of the state of @entity24 like everybody else			0
" if convicted , @entity1 could face up to one year in prison .			2
