this time last year , @entity0 was at the center of the tennis universe as she won her second grand slam title at the @entity6			1
twelve months on , the former world no. 2 is facing a whole new challenge -- getting to grips with the vacuum cleaner			2
persistent and worsening knee problems forced her to retire in september at the age of 32 , and she admits the transition from tennis star to domestic goddess has been challenging			1
" i do the house cleaning			2
before , when i was traveling , i thought it was all pretty easy			2
and now i have to do all these things i think tennis is much easier , " she told @entity2 's @entity19			1
luckily for @entity0 , she can count on the support of her husband @entity24 , with whom she is expecting her first child this summer			1
" family for me is most important thing , " she said , two days before announcing her pregnancy on the opening day of the year 's first grand slam			2
" i 'm starting to learn how to cook -- before , i never had the time or the chance			2
now sometimes i say : ' @entity24 -- i always do the house cleaning , you have to do some cooking			1
' he 's a little bit like : ' hey , i 'm the man -- why should i do this ? ' @entity0 , @entity41 's most successful tennis export , became @entity43 's first grand slam singles champion at the @entity44 before adding another title with that victory in @entity47 last year			1
but she says she 'll be happy for all that to be forgotten if she can help usher through a new generation of @entity41 tennis stars			1
" i will try to have a tennis academy to help more young children , " she explains			1
" when i said i would retire and said i wanted a tennis academy , everyone in @entity41 invited me			1
" but i have to find the right one , of course , in a big city , and to have communication with the government			2
" from what she has seen so far , lack of belief should n't be a problem when it comes to the nation 's promising youngsters			2
" i hear people say : ' oh , my daughter is 10 times better than @entity0 , ' she smiles			1
" i like this confidence			0
at least they have a goal			0
" and if she succeeds in her aim of encouraging fresh talent , @entity0 -- who won a total of nine @entity75 titles -- says she wants people 's memories of her outstanding career to fade quietly away			1
" honestly , i would like the world to forget me , " she adds			0
" because , if they always remember me , that will mean that @entity41 tennis has n't grown up			1
i wish that a lot of young or new players will come up and people will say : ' oh , this is a @entity41 player			1
' " but she admits leaving her own career behind was a very hard step to take , describing the decision to quit as " pretty sad			0
" it was also inevitable			0
" my knee could n't handle it any more , " she adds			0
" i think it was after @entity96 that i saw the knee was getting even worse			0
" at the end of july , i had to have my fourth operation			0
i tried to recover , but did n't do very well			0
" women 's tennis now is pretty tough , and everyone is much stronger			2
so if i could n't stay healthy , i could n't play at the highest level			0
if you 're a professional athlete , you always want to win all of them [ matches ]			0
you never want to lose on court			0
" after all those years on the tour -- she turned professional in 1999 -- @entity0 is slowly getting used to the idea of spending more time at leisure and less jetting from country to country			1
but she will never take her eyes off what is happening in the tennis world , and is watching the continuing progress of @entity119 star @entity118 with increasing interest			2
" i think he 's doing amazingly , " she adds			0
" last year , in the @entity123 , he was pretty close to the trophy			0
" she hopes the @entity119 star 's success will also inspire the men 's game in @entity41			1
" he 's doing well , but he 's not so tall or so strong			0
people can think : ' he 's not a western player , ' and maybe men players [ in @entity41 ] can think we could do the same or even better			1
" and as she settles down to watch her first @entity6 for years as a spectator rather than a participant , who does @entity0 feel might take the title that her retirement has left her unable to defend ? " i think maybe [ @entity96 champion ] @entity140 , " she says , backing her best friend on the tour			1
" i like the way she hits			0
" but -- as if we really needed warning -- do n't write off @entity145			0
" if she wants to win , she can win			0
" whoever lifts the trophy , it might inspire @entity0 -- knees permitting , of course -- to get back out on court and start hitting a few shots			1
there will be no glory this time , though , and no fans : all future games will be strictly for fun			1
after all , as she says , you ca n't totally leave something that has been so central to your world behind			0
" @entity161 is my life , " she concludes			0
" i grew up with tennis , and everything i know is from tennis			2
