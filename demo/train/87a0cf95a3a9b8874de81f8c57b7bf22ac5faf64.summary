-- five years ago , to show her gratitude for @entity4 troops serving overseas , teenager @entity1 started sending them donated cds and dvds			1
the project grew into her nonprofit , tunes 4 the @entity10 , and she was recognized as a @entity11 in 2008			1
at the time , she and her team had collected and shipped 200,000 discs			0
this week , @entity14 4 the @entity10 celebrated a major milestone when it prepared its 1 millionth disc for shipment			1
@entity1 , now 19 and on an @entity19 scholarship at @entity20 , spoke with @entity0 's @entity21 about reaching this goal			1
@entity21 : did you do anything special to mark this milestone ? @entity1 : we had a very special guest			1
one of the guitarists from @entity29 ( @entity30 ) showed up at our packing party to actually pack the 1 millionth cd			1
the @entity32 was actually a @entity29 cd , and he signed it to the troops			2
@entity21 : where will these discs be headed ? @entity1 : these cds and dvds will be going places all over the world			1
i know for a fact that we have boxes going to the @entity45 , which many people do n't know ( that ) we do have troops there			0
they 'll be going to @entity49 and @entity50			0
some of the boxes are going to military hospitals in @entity52			0
these cds are going to all four military branches			0
they 're going to everybody , because they all serve our country and are all greatly appreciated			0
@entity21 : why was it important to you to continue this work when you went on to college ? @entity1 : with all the hard work that i had put in , i wanted to make sure it would continue after graduation from high school			1
the troops have always had a special place in my heart			0
i 'd do anything for them ... because they sacrifice so much			0
even when i graduate ( college ) , there will still be troops serving overseas			1
when i graduate , i 'll be one of them			0
@entity21 : tunes 4 the @entity10 is now based at @entity20 how does it work ? @entity1 : tunes 4 the @entity10 is part of the @entity83 here at the university , so there 's basically a staff and student workers who volunteer for community service hours that are able to work on @entity14			1
so this way , @entity14 4 the @entity10 will be able to continue even once i graduate			2
it 's a wonderful feeling			0
i 'm very grateful for @entity20			2
if i could do tunes 4 the @entity10 all over again , there 's absolutely nothing i would change , because it has made a difference in so many people 's lives			0
@entity21 : around the holidays last year , @entity14 4 the @entity10 was included in a story on @entity0 about ways people could donate to charities without giving money			2
did you see much response ? @entity1 : after the @entity0 article on the 12 ways of giving , we got an increase in donations that helped us reach our 1 million goal			1
that was definitely one of the big things that helped us knock six months off our goal of collecting 1 million cds and dvds			1
( and ) we got some local artists and major record labels to donate as well			0
it got the word out there that we are still doing this			0
