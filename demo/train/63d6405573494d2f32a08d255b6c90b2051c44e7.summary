-- nine commuter aircraft were grounded for safety inspections tuesday at @entity5 's @entity4 after a federal security inspector climbed onto them by grabbing sensitive outside instruments , the @entity1 said wednesday			1
" it delayed a lot of folks getting to where they had to go yesterday , " said @entity10 spokeswoman @entity9			0
" this was something we had never experienced before			0
" the inspector used the total air temperature probe and the jetway to haul himself through the open doors of seven of the nine planes he inspected , a @entity1 official said			1
the inspector aimed " to look for and test , among other things , access vulnerabilities or areas were someone with ill intent could gain access to the aircraft , " the @entity1 said , adding : " aircraft operators are required to secure each aircraft when left unattended			1
" @entity35 , a spokesman for the @entity36 , said the maneuver could have damaged the probes			2
pilots use readings from the probes to gauge the probability of icing			0
" apparently the @entity1 inspector hoisted himself up using the @entity46 probe as a stirrup			1
he repeated the same procedure with nine aircraft			0
most tat probes have a painted decal on the side that reads ' no step , ' " he said			0
" we caught it this time , but who knows if this has happened other times ... and with other planes that are out there , " @entity35 added			0
he said pilots examine their planes before take - off , but they might not spot something like a part damaged in an inspection			2
" pilots are the last line of defense			0
we do our pre-flight inspections , but we do n't have a system in place to check for broken parts , " he said			0
@entity9 said the airline 's own inspectors checked out all of the aircraft , did not find any damage , and put them back in service by 10:45 a.m. tuesday			2
she said the airline is in touch with the @entity1 " and we are working through this issue with them			1
" @entity1 spokeswoman @entity82 said the inspector did not intend any harm			1
" it is not @entity1 's intent to cause delays or potential damage to aircraft as a result of our inspections , " she said			1
@entity93 , which owns and operates @entity10 , could face fines over the incident , she said			1
" the inspector was able to gain access to the interior of seven of the nine aircraft inspected , which is an apparent violation of the airline 's security program , " @entity96 said			1
the inspector was not identified			0
" @entity1 is reviewing the inspection results and , depending on the conclusion , could take action with the airline up to and including levying of civil penalties , " @entity96 said			2
@entity10 said in a statement that it was " confident that it followed all proper security procedures			0
" but , " if not observed by vigilant @entity10 employees in @entity5 , the actions of this inspector would have been unknown and could have jeopardized the safety of our customers and crew because of potential damage to the sensitive equipment mounted on the aircraft fuselage , " the airline said			2
" @entity10 is also concerned that the @entity1 inspector 's method of physically hoisting himself up to the jet bridge using a part of the aircraft could have placed him in physical danger			1

inspector grabbed instrument used to measure outside air temperature
the probes could have been damaged , so planes were grounded , inspected
@entity1 says inspector was looking for security *lapses*
because inspector gained access to aircraft , airline could face fines
