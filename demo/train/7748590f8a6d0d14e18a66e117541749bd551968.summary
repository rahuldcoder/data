-- in the ancient @entity3 city of @entity4 , locals used to enjoy a vibrant @entity6 © culture and relatively easy living			1
the city was a @entity3 success , a center for agriculture , oil and trade ; a home to @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 as well as a small @entity19 community among its one million people			1
the road through @entity4 connects @entity3 's largest city , @entity23 , in the north , to the capital , @entity26 , in the south , and it 's from there that president @entity29 's military has come			1
those days are now distant memories as the city became the heart of an anti-government uprising and this week became the focal point of the regime 's brutal clampdown			1
rebels and civilians holed up in the besieged city are dying under a relentless barrage of rocket fire			1
the @entity3 military has surrounded it with tanks and heavy weapons , and snipers are positioned on roofs , picking off anyone who dares to walk the streets , opposition activists say			1
they fear that now , after a brutal week - long assault , the army could be about to move in to wipe out the resistance			2
no one knows for sure how many people are living under the barrage			2
they cower in their homes as shells explode , destroying buildings and killing indiscriminately			2
the death toll is rising daily as world leaders talk , but with powerhouses @entity65 and @entity67 so far siding with @entity3 , there has been little more than rhetorical support			1
one man , who has got the message from @entity4 out to the wider world via @entity72 and @entity0 , is ' @entity73 ' -- an assumed name to protect his identity			1
pain etched across his young face , @entity73 said : " they are going to kill us all and if you do n't help us , they 'll kill millions and no one will find out about it			1
please , someone help us			2
" after the failure last week by the @entity85 to agree on a resolution condemning the violence , @entity4 has seen some of the fiercest attacks yet by @entity29 's army			1
one resident , who called himself @entity92 said wednesday : " there is helicopter now that attack @entity4 area			1
" thirty minute ago , two helicopters			2
and explosions in some homes there			0
" in my room , beside with my friend , because my family [ left the area , they are too scared ] no electricity			0
no [ internet ] network			0
we have @entity112 [ a hand - held satellite phone ]			0
also @entity116 [ cell phone ] network			0
" no medicine , need oxygen now [ for hospitals ]			0
" at a hospital in @entity4 on thursday the dead and the injured were arriving around the clock			1
@entity122 , a doctor , said : " all i have is gauze , bandages , old stitches and ( a ) few antiseptic wipes			0
" he has no surgical equipment to help the wounded			0
as he spoke to @entity0 by telephone there were seven thundering explosions			0
he believed @entity3 jets were firing on the city but he did not want to look out the window to check in case it cost him his life			1
" there is now way to flee @entity4 because all surrounding suburbs are also under attack and anything that moves is shot at , " @entity138 says			1
he reckons the assault has damaged 60 percent of homes in @entity4			1
families who did try to escape were captured by government forces and killed , said an opposition spokesman , who @entity0 is calling @entity149			0
videos purporting to show the violence in @entity4 appear to support the accounts of witnesses , although it is not possible to independently confirm their authenticity			1
in one scene , a row of buildings painted in pink and blue pastels survived intact but on the other side of the street , bodies were pulled from the rubble of an attack and loaded onto flatbed trucks			1
on another street a rocket tore a v - shape through a street wall as smoke filled the air			2
other video contains images of the wounded -- sometimes bleeding , sometimes bandaged -- and schools and homes that have been bombed			0
on wednesday , @entity73 spoke via @entity177			0
wearing headphones and locked in a white - walled room , he showed off a mortar that had landed nearby : " we are human beings , we 're like animals being killed here			0
... i am scared a rocket might land in this room and kill me			1
" women and children have got used to seeing blood and body parts in the street			0
" the @entity3 army is surrounding @entity191 with army troops and tanks and anti-aircraft			1
they have been bombarding us with rockets			0
" there are snipers all around these buildings			0
anyone who tries to come up the street will get shot			0
we always walk along the wall so the sniper does not see us			0
" in video dispatches posted on @entity72 , @entity73 showed a military vehicle he said was captured by rebel fighters , civilians living in cramped rooms , bodies carpeting floors -- and his own growing desperation			1
survivors are trapped , dodging snipers and heavy arms fire from tanks surrounding the city , and waiting to see if the army advances			2
the rebel @entity220 -- containing soldiers who defected from @entity29 's military to join the rebels -- is unable to fight back because government forces are striking from outside the city beyond the range of their small arms , @entity149 said			2
" who 's going to resist ? you ca n't see anything , so there is not any armed resistance in these areas , " he said			2
parts of the city are without power			2
sometimes the security forces shut down electricity and telecommunications networks ahead of early morning raids to root out opposition members			0
" if you 're in a place where they cut off the power or the phones , you know you 're in trouble , " @entity149 said			0
there is a shortage of everything from children 's milk formula to oil for heating , and he says security forces are preventing medical aid from reaching dying citizens			2
standing in a shelled street , @entity73 yells into his camera : " where 's the @entity85 ? , where 's the humanity , where is @entity263 ? " @entity0 's @entity264 , @entity265 staff and journalist @entity266 contributed to this report			0
