@entity3 the @entity2 @entity1 takeover is a hot conversation topic in @entity3 , but outside the nation 's capital , @entity6 are n't feeling much of a change as the new @entity10 gavels into session on tuesday			1
about 6 - in - 10 @entity6 believe the new @entity10 wo n't get more done compared to the previous @entity10 , according to a @entity4 / @entity13 poll released tuesday			1
and about half of @entity6 surveyed said they do n't expect @entity10 to be more or less responsive this time around			1
on the flip side , 37 % of @entity6 have faith the new @entity10 will get more done than the last and just 30 % of @entity6 think @entity10 will be more responsive to the public in the new session			1
republicans swept the midterm elections , gaining control of the @entity1 and keeping control of the @entity23			0
but that does n't mean @entity6 are confident the @entity2 will do a better job running the @entity1			2
related : read the entire @entity4 / @entity13 poll results just 28 % of @entity6 think the @entity1 will be better off with republicans wielding the gavel and controlling the flow of legislation to the @entity1 floor			1
and 24 % think @entity2 will do a worse job			0
and in a @entity4 / @entity13 poll published last month , half of @entity6 predicted @entity2 control of both houses of @entity10 will be bad news for the country -- with most saying it will cause more gridlock in @entity3			2
@entity42 , in his final two years in office , will face off with a @entity2 majority in @entity10 for the first time of his presidency			0
but on the whole , @entity6 are now just feeling apathetic to the change in power : 46 % said there wo n't be much difference in how the @entity1 runs			1
the public has some partisan woes of its own , with the @entity6 polled split down the middle on whether @entity2 or @entity55 should make more concessions to pass bipartisan legislation			1
those compromises are sparse on @entity59 , and respondents spread the blame on both parties , though slightly more pinned the lack of cooperation on @entity2			0
@entity6 ' low expectations for @entity10 are nothing new : a whopping 83 % of @entity6 said they disapproved of how @entity10 was handling its job in a september @entity4 / @entity13 poll			2
those surveyed in the @entity4 / @entity13 poll released on tuesday also sounded off on the role of government			0
their message ? less government and less focus on values			0
the government is trying to doing too much that businesses and individual should handle , 58 % of @entity6 surveyed said			0
and 55 % said the government should n't be in the business of promoting traditional values -- or any values , at all .			0

6 - in - 10 @entity6 do n't think the new @entity10 will get more done than the last
and about half say they do n't expect @entity10 to change how responsive it is to the public
