-- @entity2 chiefs have pledged to arrest fears that sailors and windsurfers at the next games will not just have to deal with their rivals on the water but a potential super-bug under it			1
researchers have found a bacteria more typically encountered in hospital waste which produces the enzyme @entity13 in several different locations along the @entity16 , which feeds @entity17 where the sailing events will take place			1
the bacteria is resistant to antibiotics and can cause urinary , gastrointestinal and pulmonary infections although @entity26 officials are adamant the risk is " minimal			1
" but the @entity28 insisted it had been made aware of the problem and was working closely with @entity26 officials to minimize any potential risks			1
the @entity28 statement , sent to @entity0 , read : " the health and safety of the athletes is our number one priority			0
@entity26 has created a task force to monitor this situation and we are being kept fully updated by them			1
" we will continue to work with @entity26 to ensure that the athletes are able to compete safely and in the best conditions possible			1
" the research is the work of the @entity44 , considered one of the world 's main public health research institutions			1
study coordinator @entity48 , of the foundation , said in an email to the @entity51 : " there is a risk of contracting diseases , which are not more serious than those caused by other microorganisms			2
the problem is that in case of infection , it is possible that treatment involves hospitalization			0
" since the super-bacteria are resistant to most modern medications , doctors need to rely on drugs that are rarely used because they are toxic to the organism			1
" earlier this year , biologist @entity68 described the @entity69 , which will serve as a base for the sailing competitions , as a " toilet			2
" while @entity26 mayor @entity75 admits a planned clean - up will not be completed prior to the @entity6 , state officials have allayed fears over the risk to sailing competitors that take to the water			1
in a lengthy statement from the @entity84 , forwarded to @entity0 , it said : " according to the president of the institute ( @entity84 ) @entity88 the bacterium is not very resistant in the environment , especially in salt water			2
" there 's no need to panic			2
the possibility of discovering this bacteria in our beaches is minimal , almost non-existent -- assured @entity88 , highlighting that there are no records of people -- contaminated with the bacteria outside of the hospital environment -- being admitted to @entity26 's public hospitals			1
" @entity13 is a bacteria which loses its potency when it comes into contact with salt water			0
it 's not an aggressive bacteria			0
it 's only resistant to antibiotics			2
it only represents a risk to those people who have a weak immune system -- explained the specialist			0
" as for @entity119 organizers , they have been in contact both with the government and also the @entity44			0
a spokesman for @entity119 told @entity0 : " we were alerted to a possible presence of @entity13 - type bacteria in some parts of the @entity16			0
@entity119 created a task force regarding this matter			0
" the group will continue to monitor the matter very closely and discuss with the government and with specialists the solutions to prevent contamination of the water and continue to guarantee the safety of athletes			0
this issue does not impose any change in our planning for the test events and competition events			0
