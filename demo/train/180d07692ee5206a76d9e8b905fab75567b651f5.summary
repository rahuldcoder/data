all their favorite characters on tuesday night 's series finale of " @entity5 , " they got just what they wanted			1
as the team planned to go their separate ways , viewers got a look into each character 's future			1
@entity13 started a foundation after checking off everything on her bucket list ; @entity17 found love with @entity20 's barber ; @entity21 went on the run after faking his death ; april and @entity24 had kids ; @entity26 wrote a popular book about all his failures ; @entity29 was mayor of @entity30 for decades before dying on his 100th birthday ; @entity20 was put in charge of his own national park			1
and what about @entity34 and @entity35 ? they were both offered the chance to run for governor of @entity40 at a party at the @entity43 ' home ( hello , cameo ! )			2
in this flash - forward , they were reunited with the old gang once more , including @entity46 and @entity47 ( it felt good to hear @entity46 say " literally " again )			0
another flash - forward showed that @entity35 served two terms as governor ( and @entity29 's funeral implied that either she or @entity34 became president )			2
the narrative device insured that we all knew where their lives ended up and tied it all up with a bow -- though it pretty much eliminated the chance of any kind of reunion			0
despite her worries about leaving her friends , @entity35 said " i 'm ready " to face the future as the series signed off ( along with a tribute to late producer @entity69 )			0
the show 's finale was widely praised on social media and may someday rank as one of the best finales of all time			0
@entity77 fans were touched and impressed with how it ended up			0
there was also plenty of discussion on social media about # @entity83 , as the show frequently had characters gathered at @entity86 , where they would enjoy the breakfast staple .			1

the hit series ended its run tuesday night
viewers got a peak into the character 's futures
