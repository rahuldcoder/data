it 's something pioneer nurseryman @entity2 likely never imagined			1
the @entity4 @entity3 on friday approved @entity4 's first genetically modified apples			1
their appeal : they do n't turn brown when bruised or sliced			0
" this is really huge			0
it 's what we 've waited almost five years for with regulatory approval , " says @entity9 , founder and president of @entity11 , the @entity12 company that engineered the apples			1
" now we can get down to business planting trees and selling @entity20 apples			1
" the @entity3 's @entity21 granted its approval " ... based on a final plant pest risk assessment that finds the @entity25 ( genetically engineered ) apples are unlikely to pose a plant pest risk to agriculture and other plants in the @entity4 ... [ and ] deregulation is not likely to have a significant impact on the human environment			1
" the @entity32 is not required to approve genetically engineered crops for consumption			1
most companies engage in a voluntary safety review process with the @entity32 , and @entity37 is doing that			0
scientists working on genetically engineered plants and animals typically add -- rather than remove -- genes to formulate more desirable variations of their products			1
for example , a @entity46 salmon , engineered by @entity47 , is mostly @entity49 salmon -- with a @entity51 salmon gene added to make it grow faster , plus an added eel gene to make it grow year round			2
to create their granny and @entity59 varieties , @entity37 turned off an enzyme that causes apples to turn brown			2
but what else did they turn off ? " these are called ' nontarget effects , ' and i 'm comfortable and confident this has n't happened , " says @entity9			0
" we 've had them in the ground and have been watching them grow for 12 years , compiling data and statistics			0
the trees produce flowers and fruit of the same composition and analysis [ as conventional apples ]			2
" but not everyone is convinced			0
@entity80 and @entity81 , the husband - and - wife authors of " @entity84 , @entity85 , " launched a @entity87 petition two years ago to " @entity88			1
" " we sounded the alarm back in 2013 and hoped people would understand what a slippery slope it is to have all of these foods that are genetically modified , " says @entity91			1
" obviously , we ca n't say without a doubt that gmos are dangerous , but we can say that not enough human studies have been done			0
we do n't want to be the guinea pigs			0
" " this particular food is very upsetting because we give it to our children , " says @entity91			2
" it 's the symbol of health here in @entity4			1
' an apple a day keeps the doctor away			0
' " what you might not realize is that some genetically modified foods are likely part of your diet already			1
in november , the @entity3 approved a genetically engineered potato , developed by the @entity113 , which uses a similar technique to prevent browning			1
still , most of the genetically modified foods we eat are processed , containing ingredients made from bioengineered corn or soybeans			1
the majority of @entity46 have been modified to fend off insects or survive being sprayed down with weedkillers , but the benefits of these new apples are geared toward the consumer			1
where @entity9 sees apples that do n't turn brown opening opportunities for more varied and prolonged use of the fruit , the @entity127 see a conundrum			2
how will we be able to know when the apples have gone bad if they 're no longer turning brown ? we 've got some time to mull it over			2
" it takes two years to build a nursery and another two years to get fruit , " says @entity9			0
" we 're saying 20 acres of trees in the ground this spring will produce a small amount of fruit by fall 2016			0
" when that time comes , @entity9 does n't feel his company should be forced to use a @entity46 label			2
" we 've spent time and money on five years of regulatory work to prove and to demonstrate our product is as safe as any other , " he says			0
" label it just like any other apple			0
we 'll have information at the point of sale , and we 're very transparent on our website			0
