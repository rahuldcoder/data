@entity11 , @entity12 -- " let the word go forth from this time and place , to friend and foe alike , that the torch has been passed to a new generation of @entity6 -- born in this century , tempered by war , disciplined by a hard and bitter peace , proud of our ancient heritage ... " — @entity14 , inaugural address , 1961 at the risk of being accused of ageism , let me suggest that the @entity19 should set its mind in 2016 to nominating a presidential candidate who is young enough to make their likely @entity23 opponent look , well , not so young			1
in november 2016 , @entity24 — who wo n't be the only @entity25 running in the primaries , but will surely be the frontrunner — will be 69 years old			1
already , we 've seen one headline that spells out what a lot of @entity6 may be thinking : " is @entity32 to be president ? " we 're not supposed to ask that question or mention @entity32 's age			1
that 's because she 's a woman and a @entity25 and we 're only allowed to bring up a candidate 's age when we 're talking about men and @entity19			1
besides , @entity40 is a baby boomer , and that demographic of 70 million @entity6 is determined -- by virtue of sheer size -- to redefine every stage of life			0
we can expect to read plenty of articles in the months to come , green lit by baby boomer editors , about how 70 is the new 40			0
all spinning aside , here 's the bad news for @entity23 : while @entity6 have come to expect that being president tends to prematurely age whomever occupies the office , when it comes to electing a president , they still seem prefer to vote for people for whom the aging process is n't already too far along			1
that 's a polite way of saying that voters often prefer younger candidates to older ones			1
in the field of politics -- as in sports and entertainment -- many people worship at the altar of youth and what president @entity14 used to call " vigor			1
" even in the best of times -- economic prosperity , a healthy job market , no threats to our national security and so on -- being president is a tough gig			2
the job is intellectually taxing , emotionally draining , and physically demanding			0
i would imagine that just the daily terror briefings alone , where the president is informed of all the plots that were foiled by authorities the night before , is enough to turn one 's hair white			2
in 1984 , president @entity94 -- at 73 -- famously quipped during a debate with his 56 - year - old @entity23 opponent , @entity96 , that he would n't " exploit for political purposes my opponent 's youth and inexperience			1
" in his runaway bid for re-election , @entity94 carried 49 states			0
but there are lots of examples of youth carrying the day			2
-- @entity14 had no qualms about exploiting youth for political purposes			2
in 1946 , the @entity110 @entity25 vied for the state 's 11th congressional district			2
campaign posters offered the slogan : " a new generation offers a leader			0
" @entity14 won ; he was just 29 years old			0
it was 15 years later , at 44 , as he was sworn in as president , that he talked about how the " torch " of leadership had been passed to his cohort -- the fabled " @entity119			0
" -- in 1992 , 46 - year - old @entity40 went on @entity122 , played the saxophone on " the @entity124 " and told @entity6 -- in the words of @entity126 -- " do n't stop thinking about tomorrow			0
" in that race , @entity40 defeated the incumbent president , 68 - year - old @entity128			0
in 1996 , a 50 - year - old @entity40 beat sen. @entity129 of @entity130 , who was 73 years old			0
-- in 2008 , after a campaign full of whispers about his opponent 's health and vitality , 47 - year - old @entity131 handily defeated sen. @entity138 of @entity139 , who was 72 at the time			1
four years later , in 2012 , a 51 - year - old @entity131 cruised to victory over 65 - year - old @entity142 , the former @entity110 governor			0
now imagine how 2016 could shape up			2
by then , a 69 - year - old @entity24 could find herself slugging through a tougher - than - expected @entity23 primary against a 73 - year - old @entity144 or sen. @entity145 of @entity110 , who will then be 67 years old			1
democrats should take a good hard look at more youthful candidates such as @entity150 gov. @entity149 , who will be 58 years old , or a 53 - year - old @entity151 , the governor of @entity153			2
meanwhile , @entity19 should definitely be looking for a younger candidate on the assumption that @entity40 will be the nominee			1
in fact , @entity157 chairman @entity156 should just flat - out declare that -- for this job -- anyone over 60 years old need not apply			2
some might consider this requirement unfair , even tantamount to age discrimination			2
all sorts of jobs have mandatory age limits attached to them			0
why not the presidency ? it 's true that , in 2016 , there will be millions of @entity6 who are older than 60			1
but i would wager that more of them will -- at that stage of life -- be interested in easing into retirement than running for president			0
older voters do n't necessarily vote for older candidates , just as younger voters do n't always support younger candidates			1
a @entity19 age limit would still leave an opening for what will be , in 2016 , a pair of promising 45 - year - old @entity187 senators — @entity188 of @entity189 and @entity190 of @entity191			1
sen. @entity192 of @entity193 would also make the cut since he 'll only be 53 years old			0
rounding out the top tier of @entity19 hopefuls , @entity196 gov. @entity195 will be 49 years old , and @entity200 gov. @entity199 will be 54 years old			1
the bad news : capping applicants at 60 would exclude one of the best @entity19 prospects — former @entity191 gov. @entity203 , who will be 63 in 2016			1
the good news : it 'll also spare the country another quixotic presidential campaign by @entity142 , who would be 69			0
this is n't about ability			0
so the question is n't whether a given candidate is too old to serve as president			0
it 's whether voters are willing to hand the presidency over to someone who they perceive as too old			0
in 2016 , the message to both parties should be : " go young — or go home			1

@entity224 : 2016 @entity19 candidate should be young , to make @entity23 opponent look old
he says we 're ' allowed ' to mention older male candidates ' age but not @entity32 's . it 's an issue
candidates age *quickly* in tough office . with some exceptions , youth , vigor better , he says
@entity224 : candidates should be capped at 60 . 2016 message : ' go young , or go home '
