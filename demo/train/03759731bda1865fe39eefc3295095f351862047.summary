-- there 's @entity2 and @entity3 , the @entity4 and @entity5 ... @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9			2
but do you recall the geekiest holiday specials and movies of all ? for those looking for a change of pace from the traditional holiday fare on tv this season , here are some suggestions for programming that 's traditional in certain households of the , shall we say , nerdier variety			1
some of them are regularly seen on cable , others are extremely rare , but all of them are cult classics			2
" @entity29 " this is the granddaddy of them all			2
debuting on @entity33 in november 1978 , and subsequently never aired on television again , it survived thanks to a few early adopters of the vcr and was passed from fan to fan through the years			2
some might have thought it was a legend until they laid their eyes on it the first time			2
the story centers on @entity46 's family - whom , you might remember , do n't speak @entity48 - as they prepare to celebrate the @entity51 holiday of " @entity29			1
" guest stars including @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 ( in multiple roles ! ) show up , as well as the movie 's cast of @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61			2
at one point , @entity61 sings the " lyrics " to the " @entity64 " theme			2
there 's also a notorious scene where @entity68 sings to @entity46 's father , @entity46			1
for all of its campy appeal , there 's also an animated portion which introduces fan favorite @entity73 , and it 's quite good			2
at the same time , if you 're not a big fan of " @entity64 , " chances are you 'll have trouble sitting through the entire two hours , 1970s commercials and all			2
" @entity80 " it 's no secret that stop - motion animation and the holidays naturally seem to go together ( witness the most recent episode of @entity86 's " @entity85 " ) , and this wo n't be the last one of those on the list			1
in 1993 , @entity91 unveiled his creation of " @entity93 , " a world of ghouls ruled by @entity96 , who accidentally found himself in @entity97 and immediately had to find out more about it , studying it like a science experiment --- even turning it into an equation			1
the movie , which originally was n't released under the @entity105 banner because of its dark nature , made a respectable $ 50 million at the box office			0
in the years since , it gained a cult following , and slowly , the @entity111 theme park and merchandising machine began to embrace it ( it takes over the " @entity114 " every holiday season at @entity113 )			1
it 's also been re-released in theaters twice in @entity116 " @entity117 " @entity33 executives probably envisioned an entire special devoted to the @entity119 , a big sensation in 1987			0
instead , " claymation " master @entity121 gave them a show hosted by , well , two geeky dinosaurs , introducing new takes on classic @entity97 carols			1
our hosts could n't agree on the meaning of the term " wassail " throughout the proceedings			0
the special went on to win an @entity133 , and yes , the raisins showed up at the end to sing the @entity137 ' version of " @entity138			0
" but , for my money , the highlight is " @entity147 , " which would have easily fit in as a " @entity146 " cartoon ( the stunning animation on " @entity144 " a close second )			0
if this does n't get you in the holiday spirit , i do n't know what will			1
" @entity152 " continuing on the @entity91 theme , we have this sequel from 1992 , which , despite its summer release , actually took place during the holidays			0
this one will start fights among comic book fans			0
most will agree that @entity164 's @entity163 was just about perfect			0
but for every supporter of the film , there 's another who thinks that a movie where @entity170 is essentially playing " third fiddle " is not a @entity170 movie at all			0
either way , it 's probably the only holiday - themed movie where someone 's nose is bitten off			1
" @entity97 comes to @entity178 " in the early 1980s , saturday morning cartoons took notice of the video game craze and did several mostly - forgettable series based on them			1
the king of them all was " @entity187 , " and @entity186 even went so far as to create this holiday special			1
as one might imagine , @entity188 has a little trouble with his sleigh , and crash - lands in @entity178			1
@entity187 and his family use power pellets to help him continue his @entity97 mission , while fending off ghosts led by the evil @entity196			1
( check this one out on @entity199 's @entity198 ! --- which , like @entity0 , is a @entity200 company --- during @entity97 weekend )			1
" @entity201 " / " @entity188 " ( 1959 ) for out - and - out cheese , " @entity178 " and the " @entity29 " have nothing on this , what may be the first holiday - themed sci - fi movie			1
a mainstay in late - night syndication and on cable throughout the holidays for decades , it seems that the children of @entity213 are in need of a little holiday merriment , so the @entity216 kidnap @entity188 , along with some innocent bystander @entity219 kids			1
in recent years , many have preferred seeing this one getting the " @entity222 " treatment -- the cult comedy show riffed on it in the early 1990s			0
this movie was so popular with fans that some of the original " @entity222 " crew did it again in 2008 , with new riffs on the movie as part of " @entity231			0
" then there 's the truly bizarre " @entity188 " from @entity235 , in which @entity188 has to fight off one of the devil 's minions ( who spends most of the movie prancing about in his red makeup and tights ) , while keeping a close watch on all the children of the world , using advanced spying methods , such as a disturbing eye telescope			0
the poor dubbing adds to the whole affair , and @entity188 's laughter comes off as just creepy ( not to mention his mechanized reindeer )			0
it , too , was given the " @entity222 " treatment in the show 's fifth season			0
" @entity256 " all of the holiday episodes --- including this year 's --- have been hugely entertaining , and all of them have featured the robotic @entity188 , who goes on a rampage every year because of a glitch that caused him to believe almost everyone on earth to be naughty			2
new additions through the years have included @entity265 and @entity266			0
" @entity268 's @entity267 " when you think of nerds in the 1980s , you probably think of " @entity271 , " @entity272 or @entity273			0
pee - wee 's 1988 @entity97 special was truly one of the weirdest ever , even weirder than most episodes of his saturday morning show			1
featuring everyone from @entity281 to @entity282 , from @entity283 to @entity284 , and from @entity285 to @entity286 , the plot goes something like this : pee - wee is generally a jerk to everyone on @entity97 and keeps receiving fruit cakes , which he turns into a new wing of the @entity267			1
another one that 's probably only worth seeing if you 're a fan			0
" gremlins " not the first movie you would think about during the holidays , but it 's been ranked on many " best holiday movie " lists by film geeks over the years			2
if you were anywhere in the ' 80s , you probably know the story of @entity307 , the mogwai who multiplied when exposed to water , and whose offspring became the grotesque gremlins when fed after midnight			0
they proceed to wreak havoc throughout the town at christmas time , and the movie is still a lot of fun more than 25 years later			0
" @entity321 " / " @entity320 " you ca n't have this list without a little @entity323 , now can you ? the production company was , after all , behind the best - known adaptation of " @entity326 , " prior to the upcoming movie , and of course the well - known " @entity2 " and " @entity330 " specials			1
1974 's " @entity321 " is a real favorite among the hard - core aficionados of its stop - motion specials			1
you 've got the @entity335 , the @entity336 , plus the two elves , @entity338 and @entity339			0
what 's not to love ? @entity323 was riding high in 1974 , because it also put out the hand - drawn " 't was the @entity342 " the same year			1
here , @entity344 's geeky son , @entity343 , learns the true meaning of @entity97 after writing @entity188 to tell him he did n't exist			1
" @entity346 " now here 's a real obscurity			0
based on @entity352 's " @entity353 " comic strip , nerdy penguin @entity349 only has one wish for @entity97 ( see the title )			1
" @entity360 , " " @entity361 " and other comic strip series had made beloved tv specials , but " @entity353 " was certainly the first one to come to mind for a new one			2
it probably did n't hurt that it was from @entity365 's @entity364			0
it had excellent animation and surprise voices supplied by @entity369 and @entity370			0
( again , it probably did n't hurt to have the @entity365 connection			0
) " @entity373 and @entity374 : a @entity267 " the last one on this list is far from the least			0
here , earth children teach the denizens of @entity378 and @entity379 all about their holiday of @entity97			1
most amazingly , these little moppets even melt the evil @entity383 's heart			1
it 's also notable for the appearance of some " transformers " - esque characters who seem shoehorned in			2
the ending , however , is worth the price of admission , when the kids tell their parents all about where they 've been			0
whether you prefer to spend the season with @entity96 , @entity187 or @entity273 , there 's probably something in this list for you			1

nerdy holiday favorites star @entity187 , pee - wee and @entity46
@entity323 , known for its holiday specials , also adapted " @entity326 "
even a *grumpy* *villain* like @entity383 can enjoy the spirit of @entity97
