@entity4 says he left @entity5 because the chance to build something new " outweighed the need for stability			1
" that 's the formula millions of @entity13 workers used for years to map their career trajectory			1
conventional wisdom advised workers to land a job with a big company and retire with generous benefits			1
but there 's a new breed of worker who is making that formula seem as quaint as a @entity25 tape			1
they are the ultimate risk - takers -- they leave large , successful companies to pursue their own dreams even though the economy is reeling			1
they are people like @entity4 , who resigned as @entity5 's manager of new business development in 2007 to launch @entity34 , a startup that 's designed to inspire bloggers and users of social media sites			1
@entity4 says he was getting complacent working at @entity5 , despite the company 's domination of the @entity41			1
he says he decided to leave @entity5 despite a shaky economy because he wanted to force himself to change			1
" being an entrepreneur is all about risk and innovation , not timing the market , " @entity4 says			2
" a good idea does n't wait for the perfect time to emerge			2
the ability to build something new outweighed the need for stability			2
" ireport.com : are you striking out on your own and starting your own project at home ? why leave a sure thing ? stability , though , seems to be a rare quality in the workplace			2
those who contemplate leaving the corporate cocoon ca n't help but pay attention to the constant news about corporate layoffs			2
their challenge : why leave a comfortable position in corporate america when there seem to be so few ? @entity70 had to face that question			2
he says he was a regional vice president at @entity72 , a company that provides retirement plans for nonprofit groups			2
he says the company had 5,000 employees , $ 400 billion in assets and 17,000 clients at its peak			0
but @entity70 says he started contemplating a change because @entity72 's corporate culture was changing			1
he started talking with a friend who ran a consulting firm , and he started paying attention to his emotions			1
" it was getting more difficult to get up in the morning , " he says			0
" i was n't enjoying my old job as much as i used to			0
the more i talked about the job with my new partner , the more excited i got			0
" @entity70 left @entity72 in march of 2008			0
he is now an executive at a new company , @entity90 , which has 25 employees			0
now he does much of his own typing			0
he ca n't take clients to fancy restaurants			0
he even uses recycled paper for scrap paper to save costs			0
though @entity70 misses the perks of a large company , he says he received a lot more in return			1
" there 's much quick decision making , " he says			1
" i work in a culture where we are not afraid to try new things			1
" @entity4 , who resigned from @entity5 to start @entity107 , says the large resources of a company can actually slow down the creative process			1
a person might want to invent a product , but small things like the name of the product end up being discussed in a committee			1
" you do n't find that in a small company , " he says			0
" at my new company , @entity107 , we sometimes dream things up in the morning and by the afternoon have it live on the @entity41			1
that never happens at a big company			1
" greater freedom is also what inspired @entity128 to resign from her position at @entity5 , where she helped build @entity130 , one of the company 's most successful projects			1
today , @entity134 is the founder of " @entity136 , " which helps web site developers ensure their sites can be found by potential customers , and " @entity140 , " which helps businesses use online data to better understand their customers			0
@entity128 says the challenge of creating something in an evolving space like the @entity147 was too great to pass up			0
" as hokey as it sounds , there 's more to life than money , " she says			1
" as much as i loved working at @entity5 , i am really enjoying the flexibility i have now , as well as the ability to really make a difference in the direction i choose to go in			1
" planning your exit those who leave the security of corporate life should not do it without research and a plan , some say			1
the notion of suddenly bolting a cushy corporate dream to follow one 's bliss may seem romantic			1
but some who 've done it say those thinking about making a change should make a frank appraisal of their talents and latch onto something unique that they have to offer			2
@entity70 , the retirement planning consultant , says he knew the @entity178 would soon change the retirement plans for nonprofit groups			2
he knew his expertise would be in demand			0
" i sat down and put together a three - month planning process , " he says			2
" i knew there was going to be a market out there where firms needed additional guidance			0
" all the careful planning , though , did n't remove his fear , @entity70 says			0
but he discovered something remarkable			0
once he committed to leaving , doors suddenly opened for him : people materialized to help him and amazing coincidences led to business opportunities			0
@entity70 , a devout @entity197 , says it seemed like his leap of faith was being rewarded			0
" no question , it was a scary proposition , " @entity70 says			0
" but my pastor preached about when you do the right things , the @entity205 will bless you as he sees fit			2
" yet @entity70 says he knew he could n't just lean on faith			0
" if you realize that you have some skill sets that are valuable , you can market yourself accordingly , " @entity70 says			0
" if not , you 're sitting there , waiting to see if you 're going to be downsized			0
" @entity70 says he 's happy with his move			2
he sometimes misses having the muscle of a big company behind him , but he no longer feels he 's being controlled by larger forces			1
he may have to do his own typing now , but at least he is writing his own script , he says			0
" if you allow yourself to have other people continue to dictate your future , " @entity70 says , " you 're at their mercy			0
