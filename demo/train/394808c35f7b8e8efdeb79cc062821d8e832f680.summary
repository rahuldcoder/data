-- the midterm elections made it clear that @entity2 want a government that works for the people			2
the 112th @entity6 will be faced with a choice : work with the president and the people to deliver results , or pursue an obstruction agenda that will leave individuals and businesses with an even less sustainable economy and future than they face today			2
if @entity6 chooses the collaboration path , members can tackle one issue that will enhance our national security , create jobs and help stabilize the climate -- an issue with bipartisan roots that touches every corner of this nation : clean energy			1
our nation 's energy challenges are pressing and immediate			0
unlike countries in @entity31 and @entity32 , the @entity2 has neglected to join the global clean energy marketplace			1
we have no long - term clean energy plan , and so we have few domestic clean energy technologies or industries			1
while the world surges ahead , we risk being left behind , dependent on yesterday 's energy solutions to solve today 's energy challenges			0
we know what steps to take			0
we must reduce our dependence on oil			0
the transportation sector alone is 95 percent dependent on oil			0
@entity2 taxpayers spend from $ 500 million to $ 1 billion a day on foreign oil , 39 percent of which is imported from " dangerous or unstable " nations , according to a @entity50 report			2
we must redouble our efforts to pass national clean energy and efficiency standards to meet our energy needs using homegrown , low - carbon sources			1
in turn , these actions will lower costs to consumers , create jobs , and spur an export market for innovative energy technologies			1
we must use public dollars and the government 's credit enhancement power wisely , to leverage private capital for clean energy research , development , production , transmission , storage and deployment			1
we must confront climate change , which jeopardizes our economic prosperity by leaving us acutely vulnerable to increased water shortages , widespread drought and floods , and food insecurity			0
we can solve these problems			0
if the @entity2 adopts a progressive energy strategy that combines market creation , financing for new industries and technologies , and infrastructure development , we can end our dependence on dirty fossil fuels , protect public health , and provide a solid foundation for economic growth and prosperity			1
even without comprehensive climate and clean energy legislation , the next @entity6 can take concrete steps to strengthen the @entity2 market for clean energy , providing critical stability and certainty for investors , business , and consumers			1
these polices have all previously been introduced in the @entity102 or @entity103 , with bipartisan and business support			2
none will contribute significantly to the federal deficit			0
@entity6 can : -- spur clean energy innovation , manufacturing , deployment , and export through an ambitious renewable electricity standard , extensions of the successful @entity114 grant program ( 1603 ) and section 48c manufacturing tax credit , and by establishing a @entity116 ( @entity117 , or " @entity118 " ) to leverage private sector investment for the deployment of clean energy			1
-- encourage home and business owners to invest in energy efficiency and boost employment in the beleaguered construction sector by passing @entity127 and @entity128			0
those programs would reward consumers for installing energy - efficient equipment			0
-- increase the $ 75 million liability cap for offshore oil damages , and pass other measures to enhance the accountability of oil exploration companies and give these companies an incentive to conduct their operations more safely			0
the @entity2 can and must also act on the international stage to limit the consequences of climate change and enhance our national security			1
@entity6 can show a commitment to the @entity2 goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions , take concrete steps to reverse widespread deforestation that contributes 18 percent of these emissions globally , and provide short - term financing to allow the poorest countries in the world to adapt to the impacts of climate change			1
this is not a partisan agenda			0
the midterm elections reaffirmed that the clean energy agenda is a positive political agenda			1
in @entity162 , voters overwhelmingly supported the nation 's only cap - and - trade policy even in the face of a well - financed attack led by a coalition of out - of - state fossil fuel industries			1
in defeating @entity171 23 , @entity162 voters across the political spectrum forcefully chose new technologies and new jobs over a retreat to last century 's polluted air and fossil fuel dependence -- showing broad bipartisan support for the most comprehensive emissions reduction measures the country has ever seen			1
co-chairman of the " no on 23 " campaign , former secretary of state @entity182 said it best : " those who wish to repeal our state 's clean energy laws through postponement to some fictitious future are running up the white flag of surrender to a polluted environment			2
" in @entity192 , voters elected gov. @entity193 , who campaigned as a " good green @entity194 " who believes that " @entity192 needs to be a leader in the innovative movement toward alternative and cleaner energy			0
" the clean energy economy is here for the long term			2
this @entity6 must decide if @entity2 will lead it			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers .			0

@entity206 and @entity207 : new @entity6 can create jobs , end fossil fuel dependence
clean energy is bipartisan issue , they write . we need clean energy industries
policies that encourage clean energy have been introduced with bipartisan support , they say
authors : @entity2 must act to keep up with international markets , help national security
