-- as @entity1 prepares to make the case for a first term , give a thought to what we can expect from a @entity8 second term			1
it 's probably going to look a lot like the second terms of @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , and @entity15 -- driven not by his own agenda , but by events beyond his control			2
@entity12 's second term was defined by the after - effects of the @entity23 decision he made in his first term ; @entity13 's by impeachment and the internet boom ; @entity14 's by deficits and @entity28 ; @entity15 's by @entity29			1
and what will define @entity8 's ? 1 ) @entity31 will hold at least one @entity32 , maybe two			1
2 ) the @entity34 economy will continue to mend , as the financial crisis recedes into the past			1
3 ) unless forcibly prevented , @entity37 will enrich enough uranium for multiple nuclear weapons sometime before 2017			2
4 ) natural gas production will continue to surge			2
@entity41 1 implies that there will be no bold @entity8 legislative agenda in a second term			1
the votes just wo n't be there			1
the second - term @entity8 agenda will have to be executed through agency action and executive order			1
and he 'll have lots of opportunities via the big laws passed in his first term : the @entity55 , @entity56 , and so on			2
critics often talk about how long these laws are			0
yet however long the enactment , the text of a complex modern statute is only the very roughest guide to its future operation			0
the crucial operating decisions are made by presidential appointees , supervised by the courts			0
@entity66 drafts , but the administrators fill in the details - and the details , as the saying goes , are where the devil lurks			0
a re-elected president @entity8 will have large powers to reshape the health industry and financial services -- not with some dramatic law , but with a thousand undramatic lower - level edicts that cumulatively can redefine a law in ways never imagined by its authors			1
politics : @entity83 -- @entity8 leads like he plays but there is one agreement that the president and @entity66 will have to reach : over future taxes and budgets			1
the @entity12 tax cuts of 2001 , extended in 2010 , will expire at the end of 2012			0
the president has said he would allow those tax cuts to lapse , at least for high income levels			0
@entity31 are determined to preserve them			0
who 'll blink ? on past precedent , you might guess that the president will			0
but the president knows that people expect him to blink -- which may inspire him to hang much , much tougher			0
2 ) recovery comes much more slowly from recessions caused by financial crises , according to the authors of the best study of the subject , @entity107 and @entity108			0
yet if recovery comes slowly , it does come eventually			0
by 2015 , the @entity34 economy should be reaching normal growth and fuller employment			1
deficits will begin to shrink ; the country 's present desperate mood will abate			0
and @entity31 and @entity117 will furiously argue over who deserves the credit , as they still argue over who deserves credit for the 1990s boom			1
we also saw in the 2000s , however , that employment can grow strongly without generating very much in the way of wage increases for most working people			0
the @entity34 economy added almost 2 million jobs in 2004 , more than 2 million in 2005 , about 1.7 million in 2006 , and more than 700,000 in 2007			1
yet the median wage as of the end of 2007 still had not caught up to its 2000 peak , adjusting for inflation			0
in the post- 2009 recovery , almost all the income growth has been captured by the most affluent few			0
president @entity8 may deplore that trend , but he seems to have no very clear idea of how to alter it			1
3 ) @entity34 - led sanctions and @entity143 - led sabotage have slowed the @entity37 nuclear program			1
few experts expect that these non-belligerent means will work indefinitely			0
what then ? @entity143 could attack @entity37			0
the @entity34 could hit even harder			2
but suppose -- as seems most likely -- that both allies flinch from war			0
then the @entity34 and @entity143 will confront a radically reshaped @entity150 , one in which @entity152 's friends will be weaker and more fearful and @entity37 will be more assertive and intransigent			2
the president 's hopes of reconciling the @entity157 and @entity158 worlds -- of midwifing a @entity160 state -- and of finishing off jihadist terrorism will all bump into the reality of an emboldened @entity37 and depleted @entity34 prestige			2
4 ) second terms tend to bring disappointments , but one huge success seems to be gathering for whoever happens to occupy the @entity168 over the next four years : the advent of that long promised goal , energy independence			1
the surge in natural gas production in the @entity34 , the full development of the massive oil sand resource in @entity176 , could make @entity152 the world 's fastest - growing energy region in the years ahead and put the continent on the way to self - sufficiency by 2020			1
it wo n't have quite happened yet by 2017 , but the achievement will at least be visible on the near horizon			1
it will be a strange irony of history if the president of hope and change left office as the president who presided over the greatest surge in domestic fossil fuel production since the 1930s			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			2

@entity197 : a second term for @entity8 would have a different shape
he says @entity117 likely wo n't control both houses , giving him little chance for major legislation
@entity207 : @entity8 would likely *benefit* from an improving economy but would face *challenges* *overseas*
@entity34 energy production boom would bring @entity34 closer to energy independence , he says
