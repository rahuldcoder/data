-- if you get arrested in @entity4 , better hope there are no incriminating texts or e-mails or sensitive data stored on your phone			1
on monday , the @entity4 @entity10 ruled that police in that state can search the contents of an arrested person 's cell phone			1
citing @entity18 @entity10 precedents , the ruling contends that " the loss of privacy upon arrest extends beyond the arrestee 's body to include ' personal property ... immediately associated with the person of the arrestee ' at the time of arrest			1
" two justices ( @entity30 and @entity31 ) dissented from the majority opinion : " in light of the vast data storage capacity of smartphones and similar devices , the privacy interests that the federal constitution 's @entity34 was intended to protect would be better served by a rule that did not allow police to rummage at leisure through the wealth of personal and business information that can be carried on a mobile phone or handheld computer merely because the device was taken from an arrestee 's person			1
" in a blog post , @entity50 attorney @entity49 summarized the @entity4 case that led to this ruling : in 2007 a @entity55 deputy sheriff witnessed a drug deal involving a car driven by @entity58			2
@entity58 and his passenger were immediately arrested , and six @entity61 pills were seized			0
at the police station , @entity58 's phone was confiscated			2
@entity58 denied knowledge of or involvement in the drug deal			0
after @entity58 was interviewed by police , @entity49 writes , the deputy " looked at the cell phone 's text message folder and discovered a message that said ' 6 4 80 ' -- which in the deputy 's experience meant ' six pills of @entity61 for $ 80			2
' minutes later [ the deputy ] confronted @entity58 with the text message , at which time the suspect admitted to participating in the sale of @entity61			0
" but this ruling is not limited to text messages			0
the ruling allows police in @entity4 to access any data stored on an arrestee 's phone : photos , address book , web browsing history , data stored in apps ( including social media apps ) , voicemail messages , search history , chat logs , and more			1
also , depending on the use of location - enabled services or apps that store data on the phone , the police might also be able to infer the arrestee 's past whereabouts			1
what if access to your phone is locked with a security code or pattern ? according to @entity114 of the @entity115 , " the police can ask you to unlock the phone -- which many people will do -- but they almost certainly can not compel you to unlock your phone without the involvement of a judge , " she said			2
also , she noted that so far it 's legally unresolved whether police can copy data from an arrestee 's phone for future examination			1
depending on who 's getting arrested , and for what , warrantless searches of cell phone data could have wide - ranging potential to implicate not just the arrested person , but also to draw police attention to other people who might be involved ( or merely associated ) with the arrestee			1
that might sound reasonable for investigations involving street crime , but what about for people who are arrested during protests and demonstrations ? expect the @entity4 ruling to be challenged -- perhaps in the @entity18 @entity10			2
the @entity140 reports , " this issue has divided other courts			0
@entity18 district judge @entity143 of @entity144 ruled in may 2007 that police had violated drug defendants ' rights by searching their cell phones after their arrests			0
" the @entity150 reached a similar conclusion in a december 2009 ruling in which the state unsuccessfully sought @entity10 review			0
the @entity50 - @entity4 split could prompt the nation 's high court to take up the issue			0
" the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity161 .			0

police in @entity4 can now search contents of arrested person 's cell phone
the ruling allows police to access any data stored on an arrestee 's phone
data includes photos , address book , web browsing history and more
