-- @entity1 may be working on an app that will let your friends , or even complete strangers , know where you are at all times			1
if that sounds unpleasant , even creepy , you 're not alone			0
but it sounds an awful lot like a small but growing mobile sector in which users knowingly sacrifice some privacy in exchange for " social discovery			1
" and , as @entity1 works to make money off its constantly growing list of mobile users , such a feature raises questions about how the company will use the personal info it would collect			1
on tuesday , @entity24 reported that @entity1 is developing a smartphone app that would track the location of users			1
the app would run in the background of smartphones even when not opened and is designed to help users find nearby friends , according to one of two unnamed sources cited in the article			1
a @entity1 spokeswoman told @entity0 that the company has no comment about the report			1
@entity41 discovery , or stalking ? some observers have expected such a move by @entity1 since last year when the social networking giant bought @entity45 , a mobile app designed to help users find nearby friends			1
that 's similar to a handful of other mobile apps , such as @entity51			2
these services seem pitched mostly to a young , outgoing user base seeking existing or new pals for drinks , dancing , sipping coffee or sexual hookups			0
but , when applied to @entity1 's purported 1 billion - strong membership , which includes everyone from teens to grandparents , it gives some privacy advocates pause			1
" we 've already seen some of the mishaps that can occur when location is used in unexpected ways , " said @entity64 , director of the @entity65 , a @entity66 - based think tank			0
" i think the challenge is that aggregating by location clearly might provide some really useful information			0
but there are a whole lot of social norms that can be stressed , by even public information			2
" @entity64 cited girls around me , an app that rounded up check - ins by women on @entity83 and @entity1 to let users , presumably guys on the prowl , know which bars , clubs or other spots currently had lots of women in them			1
girls around me raised concerns about stalking and eventually got booted from @entity96 's @entity95			0
" it did n't clearly violate any of the specific rules that the @entity95 lays out , other than extreme creepiness , " @entity64 said			0
" but creepy is sometimes in the eye of the beholder			0
one person 's creepy is another tech enthusiast 's tool			0
" the key , he said , would be whether @entity1 clearly sets out guidelines for how such an app would be used			1
he said members should be allowed to opt in to the service , not automatically be enrolled in it unless they opt out			0
" you do n't want people ever sharing information without knowing , and i do n't think @entity1 is going to be in a position to do that , " he said			1
the future of social sharing heralded briefly as the next wave of social sharing , a handful of these location - based " social discovery " apps launched last year amid some degree of hoopla			1
but a year later , none have gained much traction among mainstream audiences in the way @entity132 , @entity83 and some other apps did before them			2
@entity134 , ceo of discovery app highlight , acknowledges it 's been a slow burn for a service such as his			1
a year after launching , highlight still wo n't release how many active users it has ( though he said membership has tripled in six months )			2
privacy concerns , he said , are part of the challenge			0
" that 's not surprising , " @entity134 said			0
" i think that any time a technology comes out that allows us to share in a way we have n't been able to share before , you see this really familiar pattern			0
" most of us look at it and think , ' that 's weird			0
that 's creepy and i do n't like it			0
' what you normally see is a subset of people saying ' that is kind of crazy , but i 'll try it out			0
' and they see it 's pretty rewarding and fun			0
" @entity134 considers apps such as his no less than the future of social sharing			1
" if you look at what 's happened on the web over the last 5 to 10 years with @entity1 and other services , we love to share , " he said			1
" we love to talk about ourselves ... and we 're obsessed with learning about other people			0
" but for some , he said , the real world can be like " some bizarre social network where every profile is a single photo			2
" on highlight and similar apps , profiles are meant to let users know if someone around them shares their interests and might be a fun person to meet			1
" it 's a big change in how the world works , " he said			0
" it 's hard for me to think of a bigger shift in how the world works , but it 's not going to happen overnight			0
" how @entity1 might use app @entity1 - owned @entity45 was somewhat more limited , pinging users when people already in their other social networks , such as @entity1 , @entity132 or @entity193 , are around			1
but for the folks from @entity197 's company , such an app could have another payoff			2
it would provide @entity1 with reams of new data about not just where its users frequently go , but where they are right now			1
@entity1 said it does n't sell its data to advertisers			1
but it definitely leverages the data to help those advertisers target potential customers			2
it 's not hard to envision ads showing up letting users know that there 's a 2 - for - 1 drink special right around the corner , or that the restaurant next door has the best burger in town			2
" they need to make money on mobile , and that 's what they 've been pushing for since the ipo , " said @entity224 , co-editor of @entity225 , an unofficial @entity1 blog			2
" they 're trying to build the technology first , then maybe find out how to build ads into it , too			0
" @entity224 , who wrote about this week 's @entity24 report , said @entity1 could launch a social discovery app separate from its main mobile app -- at least at first			1
" that 's sort of how @entity1 usually works , " he said			2
" they 'll test features , then they 'll implement them all in the native app. " how will users react to such an app , were @entity1 to launch one ? privacy advocate @entity64 said that remains to be seen			1
" the reality is that , for most people , even if things are broadcast to all their friends and the public , they still have some expectation about the way that it 's used , " he said			0
" i totally get that my neighbor knows when i come and go and may even say , ' we have n't seen you in a while -- is everything ok ? ' " but if someone else seemed to know about my comings and goings and offered me a product or service based on it ? i do n't know			0

@entity1 is working on app that tracks users ' locations , a report says
such " social discovery " apps seek to help you meet friends -- old or new
@entity272 has been a concern that slowed growth of such apps
@entity1 also could use the reams of data to target advertising
