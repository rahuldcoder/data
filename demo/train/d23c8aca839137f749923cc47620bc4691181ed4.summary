-- as the boat slowly approaches the quiet shores of @entity4 , it 's hard to shake off the eerie feeling of being transported back into one of history 's darkest chapters			1
located some 30 kilometers from @entity9 , this tiny strip of land in the @entity13 river served as a major post for the transatlantic slave trade in the 18th century			1
for tens of thousands of @entity16 , this was the place where their life in the continent ended -- men , women and children were kidnapped and brought to the island 's fort to be traded and eventually put on slave ships bound for the @entity26			1
" the @entity36 - @entity35 story is very much here , " says @entity27 , director of the @entity28 , a group of historians and archaeologists working together to turn the island into a national landmark that can be appreciated for its historical value			1
upon arriving in the @entity35 colonies , @entity36 slaves were forced to work in rice paddies , cotton fields and indigo plantations along the @entity45 - @entity44 seaboard where the moist climate and fertile land were very similar to their @entity36 homelands			0
read this : @entity36 slave traditions live on in @entity35 " there are 40 big castles like this along the @entity36 coast , but this is the only one that sent appreciable numbers of captives to what is now the @entity35 , " says @entity27			2
' the place where history sleeps ' stepping onto the uninhabited island , you quickly realize that this is a place forgotten by time , its ancient structures gradually decayed by the two centuries of tropical rain seeping down			0
unlike other slaving trading posts , nothing was ever built on the island after its abandonment in the mid- 1800s			2
its crumbling ruins , blanketed by overgrown weeds and ivy roots , remain relatively untouched to this day , serving as a reminder of the island 's dark past			1
" one @entity13 years ago used to refer to @entity4 as the place where history sleeps , " says @entity27			2
" and there 's no better description of it -- it 's a kind of slave trade ghost town			2
" read this : tracing the slaves who shaped @entity35 @entity27 says that to this day , many people in @entity13 are not aware of @entity4 's grim place in history			1
he says that the island receives just a small number of people each year , mainly foreign visitors or expatriates			0
" for tourists , it means renting a boat for 500 , 600 , $ 700 , or there are tourist services oriented toward tourists that will take you for $ 60 - 70 , " says @entity27			0
" but for local people , it 's absolutely not affordable			0
but at the same time , there 's not a lot of local interest yet in going there because people still do n't know much about it			0
" to change that , and remind both tourists and locals about its importance , the @entity28 has launched a $ 5 million project to conserve what 's left of the island			1
the group also wants to build a museum in @entity9 as part of efforts to shed light on the island 's dark past			1
" there 's an awakening now out here by the political elite and many ordinary citizens that this place is not just important for history , " says @entity27			0
" but it also can serve as a source of revenue for the country , and can strengthen the links between african - americans and @entity13 which may in the end be the most important outcome of this , because that can last forever			0
