@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity4 boy and his father are about to embark on the journey of a lifetime , traveling across the @entity8 and @entity9 by land and sea after 11 - year - old @entity12 suddenly developed a paralyzing fear of flying			1
@entity12 , who had previously always loved flying , says he can not explain what came over him on july 1 at @entity16 airport - an hour by car from his home in @entity0 -- as his family prepared to relocate to the @entity4 from the @entity1			1
" everything just went horrible for me , " says @entity12 , recalling that day			1
" i just went into body lockdown			2
i sat down and i could n't move			0
i just could n't do it			0
" @entity12 's father has no idea what caused the incident			1
" he 's been flying since he was three months old , " @entity27 tells @entity2			2
" we did n't expect it at all and really still do n't know what triggered it			0
" my initial reaction was ' come on , just get on the plane , it 'll be fine , ' " says @entity27 , sitting in the small apartment he 's borrowing from friends who are out of town			0
" but then i realized that no , it was far more serious than this			0
" the challenge has been finding an alternative travel option by land and sea that takes them across the @entity8 , while avoiding deadly conflict areas			1
the flight from @entity16 to @entity47 is eight hours long , crossing a distance of about 3,500 miles ( 5,600 km ) , as the crow flies			0
the most direct land route would take the pair straight through some of the region 's most dangerous areas , including the @entity56 capital @entity57 , into war - torn @entity58 and straight through the embattled city of @entity61 to the @entity63 border and on to @entity9			1
" obviously that 's not an option , " says @entity27			0
the maritime alternative is to sail around the @entity67 , braving the pirate - infested waters off the coast of @entity71 then up through the @entity72 past the @entity74 hot spot of @entity75 where a military operation remains under way			0
but the option of a safer land route has emerged			0
after earlier being denied entry visas by the @entity1 's @entity82 embassy , the @entity82 ambassador in @entity47 , @entity83 , intervened to help			2
the freshly - minted @entity82 visas in their passports mean @entity27 and @entity12 can now take a bus through the @entity82 and @entity88 capitals , a car to the @entity91 port city of @entity92 , then a boat to a @entity9 @entity95 city			1
the trip is expected to take 12 to 15 days and has suffered multiple false starts as the @entity98 try to line up the logistics of visas , border crossings and travel time timetables in a part of the world where buses and ferries do n't tend to conform to strict schedules			2
it 's been more than six weeks since @entity12 was scheduled to fly home			1
with his new school in the @entity4 scheduled to start on september 4 , time is not on their side			1
yet @entity12 insists that flying is still not an option			1
" it may be easy for you , but for me it 's the most terrifying thing in the world , " says @entity12 , who is currently spending his days playing computer games with friends and occasionally practicing rugby with his father in the scorching 48 degree celsius august heat			1
@entity12 has tried flying home four times			1
once , he made it as far as the flight cabin but panicked when the captain announced they were shutting the doors			0
" so immediately i knew what i had to do , " says @entity12 who thinks he may be claustrophobic			2
" i just got over the chairs , went around into the aisle and sprinted out [ of the plane			0
] " his father says they have tried various treatments including hypnotherapy and psychiatric consults			1
he says the medical center at the airport even gave his son a sedative injection before the flight , but @entity12 was still so upset that the flight crew deemed him unfit to fly			2
" it is a little frustrating , " says @entity27 who describes the whole ordeal as a roller coaster			0
" at first it was all a bit of an adventure but now it 's become more of a burden			0
" father and son both say they 're looking forward to the journey and reuniting with @entity12 's mother and sister at home			1
it is a rare opportunity for a young boy to gain first - hand knowledge of the geography and geopolitics of a region that often leads the news headlines			0
on this occasion though , it seems @entity12 has himself become the headline .			2

@entity12 , 11 , struck by sudden fear of flying on journey from @entity1 to @entity4
