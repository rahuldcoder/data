-- @entity1 , the vice president of the @entity2 and presumptive next president , will visit @entity4 this week			1
just a few months before taking over the top post in @entity6 , @entity1 will probably be cautious about what he says and does , and stick to the script and avoid inquisitive questions			0
however , president @entity10 should start candid conversations with @entity2 's leader - in - waiting about the pressing issues that define @entity15 - @entity2 relations -- the most important and complex bilateral relationship in the world			1
for some time now , that relationship has been tense			0
@entity6 apprehensively watches the growing @entity15 military presence in its neighborhood and the regional realignment driven by fears of a rising @entity2			1
@entity2 leaders are still haunted by @entity15 ideals of democracy that had inspired political dissent in the past			1
likewise , @entity4 is weary about @entity2 's ambitions and intentions			1
@entity2 's expansion of its naval force and recent veto of the @entity34 resolution on @entity35 have been interpreted by many inside the @entity37 as signs of new assertiveness or even direct challenge			1
some speculate that a serious rivalry between the two countries could soon develop			0
there are many things that @entity10 can discuss with @entity1 is @entity2 really interested in driving the @entity15 out of the @entity46 ? will @entity2 help the @entity47 denuclearize @entity48 and @entity49 ? when will @entity2 fully honor its obligations to the @entity51 ? and how can @entity2 and the @entity15 work together against terrorism , cybercrime , or human rights violations ? our love - hate relationship with @entity2 but no one expects all these issues to be sorted out in such a meeting			1
perhaps most importantly , @entity10 and @entity1 should try to get to know each other on a personal level			2
since no one knows what @entity1 really has in mind for @entity2 and its future , a productive meeting is one in which the two can start building trust and a good working relationship			1
to gain some insight on @entity1 , it 's useful to look at his past			2
born into privilege , @entity1 nevertheless spent several years in one of the poorer villages in @entity2 when his father , a top government official , was purged and then jailed during the @entity78			2
after his father was rehabilitated , @entity1 quickly climbed the political ladder in the @entity81			0
life 's extremes have not made @entity1 noticeably radical or timid but apparently more prudent and reticent			2
he has had career shortcuts but worked hard to stuff his @entity85 © in order to play the game of a semiobjective meritocracy , as have many ambitious @entity2 of his age			0
his bona fide membership in @entity2 's " @entity91 " makes him a princeling , which bestows on him the deep trust of the ruling elders in the @entity81			1
in a nonhereditary autocracy , such a trust is paramount			0
to those in power who desire to preserve the current political system and dread a possible @entity2 @entity100 , the 58 - year - old @entity1 is considered a natural successor to president @entity102 when @entity102 's second term ends this fall			1
indeed , several hundred senior officials secretly endorsed @entity1 as their top choice back in 2007			0
consequently , unlike his two predecessors -- who were handpicked by one man , the @entity107 -- @entity1 is poised to bring more legitimacy and confidence to his office			0
his peaceful and orderly transition to the presidency this fall will signal a new page in the history of his country			0
@entity1 will be facing a fast - changing world and a faster - changing @entity2			1
after 30 years of breathtaking development , today 's @entity2 is greatly diversified and decentralized			0
relying on authoritarian state control for order is becoming more difficult and costly , as social tensions and economic inequality increase			0
@entity1 will preside over the world 's second - largest economy at a time when the overheated @entity2 economy is long overdue for a correction or hard landing , which could happen as early as 2013			1
while @entity2 is secure and prosperous , its government still struggles with a perpetual mentality of being under siege			0
defending the status quo will be a great challenge			0
many incongruities make @entity1 intriguing			0
he has openly reiterated complaints about the @entity15 and its allies , yet like so many of @entity2 's rich and powerful , he sends his only daughter to study at @entity139			1
smart and low - key , @entity1 rarely steps out of the party line , and yet he spoke his mind in @entity144 not long ago to bash foreigners who are " pointing their fingers " at @entity6 's human right record , saying they are bored and have nothing better to do			2
the world will be watching @entity1 closely to see how he will govern @entity2 and navigate @entity15 - @entity2 relations			1
over a quarter century ago , @entity1 visited @entity15 as a young cadre managing agriculture for an obscure county			2
this time , as the next leader of a great country , he may remember fondly how ordinary @entity15 received @entity2 visitors with open arms back then and how much the two countries have gone through together ever since			1
let 's hope that he will open up to @entity15 on what he envisions as a mutually beneficial partnership between the two countries in the coming years			2
