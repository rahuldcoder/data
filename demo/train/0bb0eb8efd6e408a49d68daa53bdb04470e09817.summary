-- @entity1 made up for lost time at @entity4 @entity3 thursday by firing a six - under - par 64 to move one shot clear at the top of the leaderboard			1
@entity8 , who missed the tournament last year due to the birth of his daughter , finished the opening day just ahead of @entity14 with @entity15 a shot further back			1
but @entity17 , who is set to defend his @entity18 next week , finished six shots off the lead after a double bogey six at the par - four 10th left him with a round of 70			1
" with the incredible field it draws every year , you know , this is a tournament you want to be in more than any others with the majors and the @entity32 events , " @entity8 told the official @entity18 website			1
" you want to play where the best players in the world are playing			1
" @entity8 , who won the @entity35 last year , may have produced a series of impressive shots but it was the advice of his caddy , @entity40 , which made the difference			1
@entity40 has caddied for some of the biggest names in golf at @entity45 including @entity46 and his inside knowledge proved key , according to @entity8			1
" it 's hard for us players to listen to our caddies , but he basically showed me where to go and told me where to hit it , where the lines were , what clubs to hit , " he said			2
" i did n't feel like it was my first time because he had so much experience here			2
you know , had i been with a guy who had never been here , as well , i might have been a little more puzzled			2
" we joked about it a little bit yesterday			2
i have n't listened to him this much since we got together in 2011			2
but it is nice to kind of have the pressure off me when i 'm thinking about stuff			0
" meanwhile , @entity71 , who has won the @entity4 a record seven times , said he was pleased with his day 's work after recording a four - under - par 66			1
" i felt pretty good today , " he told reporters			0
" it was a little blustery , the wind was up and the greens were soft but at least the ball was flying			0
i feel very good about what i 'm doing with basically my whole swing			0
i hit a lot of good shots			0
" i had a really good feel for the distance today , and ( caddie ) @entity84 ( @entity85 ) and i really read the wind right today			0
we changed a few shots out there , and we both had a really good handle on what we were doing feel-wise with the wind			0
" the 14 - time major winner who last won at @entity45 in 2009 , rolled in four birdies in his final nine holes to move into contention at the front " i 've played terrible coming in here and i 've played really well coming in and , for some reason on this golf course , i just see it , " he said			1
" it 's just one of those venues			0
" luckily over the years i 've taken advantage of it			0
i have played well and i 've scored well , and i 've won my share of tournaments here			0
