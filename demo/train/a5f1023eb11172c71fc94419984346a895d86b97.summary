-- @entity3 's @entity2 woes continued as @entity4 were beaten 2 - 1 at home by @entity6 to go out at the first knockout stage 3 - 2 on aggregate			1
a disastrous goalkeeping error from their captain @entity10 sealed @entity13 's passage to the quarterfinals , the first time a @entity16 team has reached that stage in over a decade			2
with the tie level at 2 - 2 , @entity10 made a hash of a long - range free kick from @entity21 as he could tried to punch the ball away and saw it fly into his net			1
@entity4 pressed but could not find the two goals they then needed to avoid joining @entity27 league leaders @entity28 in exiting from @entity30 's premier club competition at the same stage			1
it leaves just holders @entity33 , who are in action against @entity36 on wednesday , as @entity3 's last hope in the competition			0
@entity39 put @entity6 ahead in the 39th minute lead only for @entity42 @entity41 to equalize two minutes later and level the tie 2 - 2 on aggregate			1
but @entity10 's error proved decisive			0
" of course it is a real shame to go out but we have to bounce back from this , " home striker @entity46 told @entity47			0
" @entity6 deserve it and you have to congratulate them even though it hurts			0
" @entity4 , who drew 1 - 1 in @entity13 and looked favorites to go through , fielded a defensive line - up as coach @entity57 opted to leave the likes of @entity46 and @entity60 star @entity59 on the bench			2
@entity63 @entity62 was left as a lone striker but it was winger @entity66 who missed a glorious chance to put them ahead after only three minutes but he shot straight at goalkeeper @entity69			0
the @entity16 , who are just back in action after their midwinter break , went ahead when @entity73 curled his shot home , but @entity76 then assisted as @entity41 equalized almost immediately			0
@entity4 had chances to move ahead before @entity10 's mistake which took the sting out of their challenge as @entity6 reached the last eight of the @entity2 for the first time .			1

@entity6 beat @entity4 2 - 1 to go through 3 - 2 on aggregate in @entity2
a *blunder* from @entity4 goalkeeper @entity10 hands @entity6 *vital* goal
it is the first time @entity6 have reached quarterfinals of @entity30 's top club competition
