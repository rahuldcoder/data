-- @entity1 have lodged an official complaint with @entity5 football 's governing body after striker @entity6 claimed he was racially abused during thursday 's match away to @entity8			1
@entity1 came from behind to win the first - leg @entity9 tie 2 - 1 in @entity10 , but the @entity12 leaders approached @entity13 after the match when @entity15 international @entity6 complained of being subjected to racist chants from fans			1
@entity13 confirmed to @entity0 friday that @entity1 's complaint had been received , but said a decision on whether to launch an investigation would not be made until the match delegate 's report had been received			1
despite reports that @entity30 midfielder @entity29 , playing his first match since sunday 's @entity27 final loss to @entity28 , was also subject to abuse , a @entity1 spokesman said the club only knew of @entity6 's complaint			1
did @entity36 's @entity35 owners act too late ? " i did n't hear this because i was concentrating on the game			0
i do n't know if ( it happened ) to @entity6 and @entity29 , " city manager @entity40 was reported to have said by the @entity41			2
@entity40 , who also coached @entity6 when they were both at @entity45 , praised the 21 - year - old for maintaining his focus during the game			2
@entity6 has had a checkered disciplinary record since arriving in @entity49 in 2010 and has just returned from a four - match ban for stamping on @entity52 's @entity51 during a league match in january			1
" i think @entity6 did very well , he played very well , " @entity40 said			2
" he was calm and it is important he continues like this			0
" i think this provocation can happen every game			0
for this reason i spoke with @entity6 before the game			0
i said , ' @entity6 think and play , think what you should do during the game			0
' " @entity62 clubs enjoy wins in @entity9 @entity6 , an @entity64 of @entity66 descent , has been on the receiving end of racist taunts in the past when representing his country			0
he was repeatedly jeered when he made his second appearance for his @entity15 in a friendly match against @entity73 in november 2010			0
@entity29 said after the @entity8 match that one of the reasons why he enjoys playing in @entity49 is the lack of racial abuse from fans			1
" that 's why we all like the @entity12 , because it never happens there , " @entity29 told @entity80			2
" maybe in foreign countries they do n't expect black players			0
" i think in future it will be okay , they will change their minds and the game will become more open			0
@entity92 is football and the fans come to enjoy the game , and we do n't want things like this to happen			0
" despite @entity29 's claims , the @entity49 game has been hit by several recent race - related incidents			2
a police investigation was launched last month when a @entity36 fan was alleged to have racially abused third division @entity104 's @entity105 during an @entity107 tie			1
@entity36 striker @entity108 has also recently returned from an eight - match ban for directing a racial slur at @entity112 's @entity111			1
in july , @entity49 captain @entity113 will face trial for alleged racial abuse of @entity117 defender @entity116			1
@entity1 's @entity118 and @entity120 's @entity119 have received racist abuse on microblogging website @entity122 , as have former @entity125 striker @entity124 and @entity128 - based players @entity126 and @entity129 , both of @entity117 , and @entity132 ' @entity131 .			1
