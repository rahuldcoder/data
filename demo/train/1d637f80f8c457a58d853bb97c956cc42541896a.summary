-- a tap water ban affecting hundreds of thousands of people in @entity5 was lifted monday after tests in affected neighborhoods returned " nondetectable " levels of a algae - related toxin , @entity2 mayor d. @entity1 said			1
" our water is safe , " @entity1 said			2
" the families can return to normal life			1
" residents and businesses that did not use their water at all -- not even for showering or washing hands , both of which were allowed under the ban -- will need to run their water first to help flush their systems , @entity1 said , but " if you 've been using water all along , just go on with life			1
" @entity1 said the city would provide details later monday about flushing systems			0
residents of @entity5 's fourth - largest city were told to avoid using their tap water all weekend after the state and federal @entity33 showed high toxin levels in the @entity2 and @entity38 neighborhoods , @entity1 said earlier monday			1
instead of isolating the two neighborhoods , @entity1 kept the ban on drinking or using tap water in the entire city until additional retests were completed			1
he declined to provide specifics on the names of neighborhoods in question and how high the toxin levels were			1
as many as 400,000 people were told not to consume , cook with or boil the tap water after a toxin called microcystin was found friday in the water supply			1
@entity2 's drinking water comes from @entity54 , where a harmful algae bloom that causes microcystin has been growing			1
the city set up distribution centers for potable water , where members of the @entity61 , fire officials and other first responders were giving out safe water			2
about 350 @entity65 were activated by @entity5 gov. @entity66 , according to a @entity68 official , adding that they set up three reverse osmosis water purification unit sites at two high schools and a police facility			2
the guardsmen also delivered ready - to - eat meals , the official said			0
lining up for water about two - thirds of the @entity2 area was affected by the water warning			2
@entity66 issued a state of emergency for @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity82 counties			0
the potential contamination also affected four municipalities in @entity85 , @entity0 affiliate @entity84 in @entity86 reported			0
there were no reports of anyone getting sick from the water , officials said			0
when certain conditions are present , such as high nutrient or light levels , algae can reproduce rapidly , forming a dense population known as a " bloom , " according to the @entity98			2
testing was crucial because @entity98 says it ca n't determine just from images whether blooms are toxic			0
ingestion of the toxin can affect the liver and cause nausea , diarrhea , vomiting and acute liver failure , according to @entity98			0
but the @entity109 said it was safe for adults to shower and for everyone to wash their hands			0
@entity0 's @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 contributed to this report .			0
