is much higher than previously believed , according to a new study published monday in the @entity7			1
by looking at a total population sample in @entity10 , the study authors estimate that 1 in 38 children in the country -- or 2.64 % -- has some form of autism			1
the approach is a new one			0
previously , researchers have examined only children known to have the neurological disorder or at high risk of developing it			0
the study authors predicted that if similar studies were conducted in other countries , the prevalance estimates would also go up			1
the research also led the study authors to believe that more girls than previously thought fall under the autism umbrella			1
what is autism ? in the @entity35 , the most recent estimates from the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) for autism prevalence are about 1 % or 1 in 110 children , based on population studies in a select number of areas around the country			1
in this new study , researchers looked at all 55,000 school children in a large metropolitan community of @entity45 , which they say is representative not only of @entity10 , but also many other developed nations			1
according to the study , researchers began with 55,266 7 - to 12 - year - old students			0
parents and teachers were asked to fill out an autism screening questionnaire			0
parents of 23,234 of the children in the regular school system responded			0
all 294 children already enrolled in special education or on the disability registry were considered to have tested positive for an autism spectrum disorder			2
from the initial assessments , 1,214 students screened positive for some form of autism			2
only 286 went on to get a full clinical evaluation , of which 201 were diagnosed with some form of autism			0
using mathematical algorithms , researchers estimate 1 in 38 children in @entity10 have an autism spectrum disorder			1
" are we surprised ? yes , " said dr. @entity71 , lead author of the study and assistant professor at the @entity74 at the @entity75			0
@entity71 said the prevalence estimates in the study , which happened to take place in @entity10 , are higher than previous estimates elsewhere , including but not exclusively the @entity35			1
@entity71 said she believes if more studies like this are done in other countries , they , too , will find an autism rate of 2 - 3 % , while acknowledging that more research needs to be done to validate the study results			1
in depth autism coverage on @entity90 the study does n't mean that suddenly many more children have autism , @entity71 said			1
instead , she suggests " they have been there all along but they were not counted in previous prevalence studies , " and that " two - thirds are in the community unrecognized and untreated			0
" @entity101 , a cultural anthropologist at @entity102 and one of the co-authors of the study , said he thinks the study 's estimates are " surprising " but he does n't think they are alarming			1
what these estimates tell us , he said , is that " autism is more common than we think it is			0
" autism and communication @entity101 said he would compare the situation in @entity10 to where the @entity35 was 20 years ago , as far as autism awareness goes			1
he said when the study began in 2005 , @entity10 believed that autism was rare in their country			1
he cited one @entity10 official who he said estimated the prevalence of autism to be about 1 in 100,000			1
at that same time , the @entity33 estimated autism prevalence to be about 1 in 150 children and @entity128 researchers believed it to be around 1 in 160 children			2
since then , new research has led to a 1 in 110 prevalence estimate			2
when asked about the newest estimates , dr. @entity132 , chief of the @entity133 of the @entity134 and @entity135 at the @entity33 , said , " we 've always said that what we report is an underestimate			0
" she said there are different ways to determine prevalence and that the @entity33 is considering a total population study of autism , but that it is not yet under way			0
@entity148 's director of the @entity149 ( @entity150 ) , believes the new data adds to what 's already been known about @entity5 in other parts of the world -- that autism is not rare			0
but dr. @entity156 , who did not participate in the study , also said , " in the current study the authors sampled from a population , noted that many folks from this sample did not participate , and performed diagnostic evaluations on a relatively small number of children			2
as such , these concerns suggest interpreting the 2 - 3 % prevalence rate reported with significant caution as it may in fact be an overestimate related to how they studied this specific community in @entity10			0
" dr. @entity172 , a pediatric neurologist at @entity173 in @entity174 , @entity175 , said the results of this study ( which he also was n't part of ) , suggest that what the numbers tell us is " that ( many ) children in this district in @entity10 have difficulties with social / communications skills			1
" " we have to be careful not to confuse them with other conditions that can also cause problems in these realms like adhd and social anxiety disorders , " he said			0
what makes monday 's study different from other autism studies is that researchers sought out children in regular schools			2
according to the researchers , few children in @entity10 are put in special education classes			2
@entity101 said about 10 - 12 % of school children from k - 12 classes receive some form of special needs education , but that in @entity10 that figure is far lower , maybe under 1 %			1
he attributes that to a law that mandates inclusion , which makes it difficult to provide special education			0
also , children in regular schools in @entity10 are in school for up to 12 hours a day , with highly structured , large classrooms , and few opportunities for socialization			2
many of the children who were identified with an autism spectrum disorder through this study were found to have a higher iq , but had poor socialization skills , one of the hallmarks of autism			2
" i think many children with autism can do well in that highly structured situation and may not get flagged as having a particular problem , " @entity101 said			0
this may explain why many children with autism in @entity10 may go unnoticed and may explain a significant difference with children in the @entity35			1
dr. @entity232 , chief science officer of the advocacy group @entity233 , which funded part of the study , believes the most important finding is that the research shows that using " the comprehensive sampling approach ... has the potential to yield an autism prevalence estimate that exceeds previous estimates			1
" @entity101 believes the most important message from the study is not the numbers , but that it suggests that " autism is more common than we previously thought and that , if we look hard enough , cases will be found and these children need treatment so they can thrive			2
" @entity250 also believes that the study clearly confirms that autism is a significant global public health concern that transcends cultural , geographic and ethnic boundaries			0
it also shows that it 's possible to translate and adopt screening and diagnostic approaches developed in @entity260 - speaking countries to effectively assess prevalence in other countries			0
@entity233 is funding similar research in @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 and @entity267 , @entity250 said .			0

a new study estimates 1 in 38 @entity10 children has some form of autism
the estimate is based on a new approach to autism research
study authors call the findings " surprising "
