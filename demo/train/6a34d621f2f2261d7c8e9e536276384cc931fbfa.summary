@entity0 -- president @entity2 met with the @entity3 -- the exiled @entity4 spiritual leader -- at the @entity5 on thursday despite strong objections from @entity8 government officials			1
the meeting has the potential to further complicate @entity8 - @entity12 tensions , which have been rising in recent months			1
@entity8 has warned it would damage @entity14 's ties to @entity0			1
" the @entity8 side expresses strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition to this meeting , " a spokesman for @entity8 's @entity16 said in a statement afterward			1
" @entity8 demands the @entity12 seriously consider @entity8 's stance , immediately adopt measures to wipe out the adverse impact , [ and ] stop conniving and supporting @entity26 separatist forces			1
" the @entity3 has said he favors genuine autonomy for @entity4 , not independence for @entity29			0
@entity14 regards the @entity31 laureate as a dangerous " separatist " who wishes to sever @entity29 from @entity8			1
@entity2 's meeting with the @entity3 " runs against the repeated commitments by the @entity12 government that the @entity12 recognizes @entity29 as part of @entity8 and gives no support to ' @entity29 independence , ' " @entity8 @entity16 spokesman @entity34 said			1
during the meeting , @entity2 stressed his " strong support for the preservation of @entity29 's unique religious , cultural and linguistic identity and the protection of human rights for @entity4 , " according to a @entity5 statement			0
the president praised the @entity3 's " commitment to nonviolence and his pursuit of dialogue with the @entity8 government , " the statement added			1
he also stressed the importance of having both sides " engage in direct dialogue to resolve differences , and was pleased to hear about the recent resumption of talks , " it noted			0
the @entity3 , while acknowledging that he raised concerns about @entity29 during the meeting , did not provide further specifics about his home region 's political situation while addressing reporters			2
he said he admired @entity12 as a " champion of democracy and ... freedom , " and he cited the need to promote " religious harmony " and " human value			0
" he also met with secretary of state @entity75			0
the meeting between the @entity3 and @entity2 could " seriously undermine the @entity8 - @entity12 political relations , " @entity76 , a senior @entity77 leader in charge of ethnic and religious affairs , warned recently			1
" we will take corresponding action to make relevant countries see their mistakes			0
" on thursday , @entity8 's @entity16 spokesman said the meeting " grossly violated the norms governing ... international relations			1
" @entity2 did not meet with the @entity3 when the spiritual leader visited @entity0 in autumn , making it the first time since 1991 that such a meeting did not occur			2
ahead of a summit with @entity8 president @entity94 , @entity2 persuaded @entity4 representatives back then to postpone the meeting with the @entity3			1
thursday 's encounter took place against the backdrop of several contentious issues already threatening to sour the relationship between @entity12 and @entity8 , including trade disputes , a recent @entity12 arms sales deal for @entity104 -- which @entity8 considers an illegitimate breakaway province -- and a censorship fight over internet search engine @entity107 the meeting is " another event in the recent , one has to say , downward spiral in @entity12 - @entity8 relations , " @entity8 scholar @entity109 said			1
it 's also troublesome for the @entity8 for one other important reason , @entity109 said			2
" he could have met him as a spiritual leader in a neutral place like a church , " he said			0
but receiving him in the @entity5 " is a political act			0
and that is going to irritate @entity8 very much			0
" the meeting did not take place in the formal , official setting of the @entity127			0
it was instead held in the @entity129 , which is considered part of the presidential residence			0
the choice of settings was considered by many observers to be a sign of @entity0 's acknowledgment of @entity14 's political sensitivities			1
some analysts said the @entity8 government could retaliate by cutting off political exchanges as it did after the @entity3 met with the heads of state of @entity142 and @entity143			2
and @entity94 could turn down an invitation to visit @entity0 in april			0
neither @entity8 nor the @entity12 can afford strained relations , said @entity146 , a diplomat and investment banker who has served as a presidential adviser on @entity8			2
" we both need each other , " he said			0
" we need each other for a number of international security issues -- to deal with the global climate crisis , to deal with the global financial crisis			1
" poll : most @entity12 favor @entity4 independence @entity8 is the largest - growing export market for @entity12 companies , @entity146 said , expanding by 65 percent last year alone			2
nearly three - quarters of all @entity12 think that @entity29 should be an independent country , according to a national @entity1 / @entity161 poll			0
but the survey , released thursday , also indicates that most @entity12 think it is more important to maintain good relations with @entity8 than to take a stand on @entity29			2
@entity1 's @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 contributed to this report .			0
