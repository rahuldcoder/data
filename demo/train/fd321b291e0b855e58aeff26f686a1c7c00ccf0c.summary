-- money talks -- that 's hardly a revelation , but the overriding feeling towards saturday 's @entity4 versus @entity5 " circus fight " in @entity7 is shock and outrage that it could even take place			1
with neither fighter holding a @entity14 boxing license , promoter @entity11 had to resort to asking the little - known @entity16 federation to sanction the bout			2
it has since been expelled from the @entity19 for agreeing to give legitimacy to an event that no - one else would touch			0
@entity5 was banned by the @entity22 and the @entity23 following his bust - up with @entity4 in @entity25 in february , while his former world champion opponent escaped punishment only because he had already retired			1
their ugly scuffle at a press conference after @entity5 's defeat by @entity32 , which @entity4 attended , has set the scene for a showdown straight from the pages of the professional wrestling handbook			1
their pantomime behavior has only served to rack up the ticket sales to close to 30,000 and secure airtime in 60 countries worldwide			1
@entity5 threatens to shoot @entity4 " @entity5 's not a nice guy , the fact he bites people in the ring , spits water in peoples ' faces , slaps people at weigh - ins , kisses people at weigh - ins			1
what 's to like ? " @entity4 said this week			1
boxing commentator @entity55 has compared @entity4 and @entity5 's @entity25 brawl to @entity58 ' pre-fight rumble with @entity59 a decade ago			1
@entity58 punched @entity59 , and in exchange the @entity60 bit his leg			0
this was heralded at the time as the biggest fight ever			0
needless to say this wo n't be the biggest fight ever , but expect passion , expect a feisty encounter between two @entity14 heavyweights who have both gone the distance with the @entity32 brothers in the past year and are still holding out for a rematch			0
@entity4 has pointed to worldwide attraction to the scuffle in @entity75 -- 20 million views of a @entity78 video showing him brandishing a glass bottle -- as justification for saturday 's fight			1
can boxing climb out of the gutter ? " people are looking at it			0
if i 'm disappointed in something , i 'm not going to keep looking at it , " @entity4 , who lost his @entity87 title to @entity88 last year , told the @entity14 @entity89			2
" beating @entity5 wo n't add to my legacy			2
in 50 years ' time when people look back at my career they wo n't see this fight and think @entity5 was a great fight and look what @entity4 did to him			1
" @entity5 does n't have any titles and has been coming off three losses			2
it 's a fight for the night , simply because i beat him up at a press conference a few months ago			2
" to give some indication of where men 's boxing is at , on the same night @entity14 's @entity108 will be fighting @entity109 in @entity110 , having been reinstated as @entity87 welterweight champion after @entity60 @entity112 was found guilty of doping following his controversial win when they met in december			1
@entity22 champion @entity109 's trainer and father has already upped the stakes by insulting @entity108 's @entity119 heritage			0
" he 's going to see a @entity119 fight on saturday and knock his son out , " @entity108 responded			1
it 's all in stark contrast to the image that women 's boxing will be hoping to portray in the @entity14 capital in the coming weeks , as females get to fight at the @entity128 for the first time			1
there 's still some divided opinion as to whether female boxers should be included at the @entity133 , but anyone who watches the athleticism and speed of veteran world titleholders @entity138 and @entity139 will be left in no doubt as to their value to the tournament			0
" she is without doubt the finest female amateur boxer in the world , " @entity55 said of @entity138 , who has won her 60 kg division at every world championships since 2006			0
according to one blogger : " @entity138 has single - handedly made women 's boxing an accepted , if not yet a mainstream sport			1
young girls throughout @entity154 lace up in clubs each week , inspired by a bona fide hero , and our collective print and broadcast media are enamored with the woman that inspired them			0
" the @entity154 fighter 's father @entity163 agrees , telling the @entity166 news website : " @entity138 's pioneered the way for female boxing , she 's made their path a little bit easier			2
" going to the @entity133 , or watching from home ? send us your pictures and videos he 's referring to the likes of 17 - year - old @entity179 , who was the youngest boxer at the @entity60 @entity128 trials in february and fights with an assuredness beyond her years			1
then there 's @entity183 , who won @entity14 's first world title on her 21st birthday in may			0
" she 's winning for fun , " says @entity55			0
@entity139 , a five - time world champion and mother of twins , has been rated as one of the world 's most marketable athletes by @entity192			0
" she has the potential to turn her into an @entity196 sporting legend and a role model for young @entity196 women , " it said			0
" despite its huge population , @entity128 golds have been thin on the ground for @entity196 but @entity203 , the daughter of a farmer , has had the kind of humble beginnings and a family - oriented appeal that could make her the archetypal national heroine			2
" the name of boxing may have taken quite a battering in recent weeks with the media circus surrounding @entity4 vs. @entity5 , but the women are sure to knock the men out of the limelight when it really matters at the @entity133			1
just do n't expect the ( possibly fake ) blood and guts you might see this weekend			0
" amateur female boxing is more about technique and skill and evading the heavy blows than it is about smashing people up , " says @entity221 in @entity14 newspaper @entity222			0
" for that reason , it should appeal to those who admire the discipline of boxing but not the blood and gore			0
