-- @entity1 remains on edge after tens of thousands of anti-government protesters " shut down " the @entity5 capital monday in an effort to force caretaker prime minister @entity7 to step aside and postpone elections planned for february 2			1
the showdown is the latest chapter in a divisive political conflict that has convulsed the country since 2005 and shows no signs of a resolution			1
who are the protesters and what do they want ? the protesters insist they are not opposed to democracy but want wide - ranging reform to clean up @entity5 politics and root out corruption before elections are held			1
their slogan is : " reform before elections			0
" they ostentatiously festoon themselves in red , white and blue -- the colors of the @entity5 flag -- and have adopted the practice of loudly blowing whistles to drive home their message to the government : " get out ! " are you there ? send us your photos and experiences but please stay safe			2
the self - styled " whistle mob " is overwhelmingly drawn from two groups in society -- the wealthier residents of @entity1 , the middle and upper classes , and @entity43 from the south of the country , who have traveled to the capital to join the protests			1
their apparent leader , @entity50 , is a southern @entity5 political strongman who has long been among the most powerful powerbrokers in the @entity53			1
the protesters have adopted much of the symbolism of recent political protests elsewhere in the world , wearing @entity59 masks and calling their planned shutdown of the capital " @entity1			1
" but there are significant differences from global protest movements against the " one percent " -- the @entity5 protesters draw their support from wealthier members of society , and are staunchly elitist , royalist and nationalist			1
they also support the country 's military , which has a habit of launching coups to overthrow elected governments			0
many protesters have openly called for a coup to kick out @entity7			0
they argue that poorer thais , particularly in the rural northeast of the country , are uneducated and sell their votes to the highest bidder at election time , allowing wealthy political strongman @entity85 -- brother of the current prime minister -- to dominate the country even though he fled abroad in 2008 to escape a corruption conviction			1
how much popular support do the protesters have ? supporters of the whistle mob insist they represent " the people " and have made inflated claims about the number of protesters who have joined mass rallies over the past two months , saying several million @entity43 have regularly taken to the streets to demand political change			1
in fact , they represent a minority of @entity43 , and this is their problem			0
in every general election held in @entity5 since 2001 , the @entity53 has been trounced by political parties controlled by @entity85 , and the same outcome is virtually certain if the february vote goes ahead			1
@entity85 's ability to dominate electoral politics thanks to his huge support from the urban and rural poor has caused immense resentment among wealthier residents of @entity1 , who believe they should be the people calling the shots			1
besides the class divisions fueling the political conflict , there are also regional faultlines -- the relatively wealthy provinces of southern @entity5 staunchly back the @entity53 , while support for @entity85 is highest in the north and northeast			1
@entity43 object to having their electoral choices drowned out by the votes of the masses , and southern @entity125 object to losing out in every election to the votes of the more populous , but poorer , north and northeast			1
opponents of the protesters include the @entity131 " @entity136 " movement and also progressive pro-democracy @entity43 in @entity1 who have held several candlelight vigils calling for peace and have adopted the slogan " @entity135			2
" they argue @entity5 's divisions can only be healed by embracing democracy , and say canceling the february election would be a disastrous step backwards			1
several commentators have drawn parallels between the whistle mob and the @entity145 movement in the @entity146			0
both groups have overwhelming support in some parts of the country and among some social groups , but are unable to win national elections at the ballot box , and so have increasingly adopted disruptive tactics in response			0
what 's going on behind the scenes ? one reason the @entity5 conflict can often appear so bewildering is that an important element of the story is routinely left out			2
one of @entity5 's most sacred taboos forbids discussion of the royal succession when the ailing 86 - year - old @entity165 passes , and the country 's draconian @entity167 © law imposes long jail sentences on those who discuss uncomfortable facts about the monarchy			1
the royal succession is absolutely central to the ongoing conflict that has engulfed @entity5 since 2005			2
although @entity5 is nominally a constitutional monarchy in which the palace has a purely symbolic role , in fact the king controls a vast royal fortune conservatively estimated at more than $ 30 billion and wields enormous influence			2
@entity5 has long been dominated by an oligarchy of immensely wealthy families connected to the palace through intermarriage and through business deals with the @entity187 , which manages royal wealth			2
the @entity5 establishment fears the rise of a new political and business elite revolving around @entity85 , which would spell the end of the dominance of the old elite			2
will there be violence ? unfortunately this seems possible			0
several people have been killed and wounded in recent weeks , and the casualty toll is highly likely to rise significantly after the @entity1 blockade gets under way			0
both sides in the conflict between @entity5 's old establishment and the new elite allied to @entity85 have sought to provoke chaos and bloodshed in recent years			2
the aim is to provoke a harsh crackdown from the other side that creates the impression it has lost legitimacy and become tyrannical			0
opponents of @entity85 blockaded @entity1 's airports in late 2008 and succeeded in toppling the government			0
@entity85 's supporters occupied the center of the capital in april and may 2010 , and @entity85 has been widely accused of funding an illegal militia that worsened the mayhem -- though he has emphatically denied supporting violence			0
the latest protest will use tactics from the same playbook			0
by paralyzing @entity1 , the movement 's leaders hope to push the @entity7 administration into adopting a heavy - handed response , or to stir up violence among the government 's @entity136 supporters			2
they then intend to exploit the chaos to declare the government is unable to govern with legitimacy , and to provide a pretext for the conservative military to launch another coup			0
they know that they can not win the february elections , so they will do all they can to prevent the polls from taking place			0
if they succeed , this will further inflame the resentment of poorer thais who believe their electoral aspirations are routinely ignored by the establishment			1
if they lose , they will almost certainly become even more disruptive in the months and years ahead , until the unacknowledged succession struggle plays out			0
either way , the prognosis for @entity5 is depressingly bleak			0
the opinions expressed in this analysis are solely those of the author .			0
