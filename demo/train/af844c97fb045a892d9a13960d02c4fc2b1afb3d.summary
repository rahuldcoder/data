-- the latest nude celebrity photo leak is yet another case of how the @entity3 often lets people do whatever they want to whomever they want			2
on sunday , a user of anonymous @entity3 message board 4chan posted hundreds of nude photos of some of @entity11 's biggest celebrities , including actress @entity12 and model @entity13			1
the poster claimed photos of @entity16 and @entity17 were included , but the singer / actresses deny that the photos are real			1
representatives and the women themselves have begun issuing their denials ( in the case of @entity26 and @entity27 ) and confirmations ( in the case of @entity30 and @entity31 )			0
a representative for @entity30 confirmed in an email to @entity34 that the images were stolen from the actress ' @entity38 account			1
" this is a flagrant violation of privacy , " the representative said			1
" the authorities have been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of @entity12			1
" of course , what happened here is more than a violation of privacy ; it 's flat - out criminal invasion			1
@entity50 , however , may be something of a long shot			0
although a @entity55 man responsible for breaking into the private email accounts of more than 50 celebs and posting many explicit photos online is serving 10 years in prison , the law is only just beginning to catch up to the problem of what is broadly referred to as " revenge porn , " or the unauthorized posting of explicit content without the consent of the individual			1
most websites that host these photos are protected by a federal law that absolves them of responsibility for material posted by third parties			2
it 's legal in most of the @entity76 , and only a few states -- about 12 -- have laws that make posting on such sites a crime ... if you can even find out who the poster is			1
prosecuting depends on first determining who uploaded the photo and where the photo originated			0
a @entity90 law , for example , did not , until just last week , protect victims who took the photos themselves			2
these unclear , largely ineffectual laws have in turn encouraged a culture of victim - blaming , which we 're seeing here in full force			0
consider that the biggest headlines have n't been along the lines of " how can someone can do this and get away with it ? " but a debate over who bears greater blame : @entity108 's @entity38 or the women themselves			1
certainly , the surest way to avoid ever having your most private photos shared publicly is to not take them in the first place			2
this is the philosophy behind the most common advice given to teens , among whom the rates of " sexting " continue to rise			0
even better : take nothing			0
while we 're at it : do n't leave the house			2
after all , you could get mugged , or raped			0
you 'd better not fly on a jet , either , what with all the terrorism and overworked pilots			0
swim in the ocean ? no way : sharks ! it 's ridiculous logic			2
how celebrity nude photos get leaked and yet much of the reaction to the celebrity leak has fallen prey to such logic , questioning why these celebrities would take such risqué — and risky — photos in the first place			1
for this reason , taking nude photos is most definitely a right to fight for , if only because ceasing to do so is a form of victim blaming , and far more harmful than protective			1
the blame for a crime lies not with the victim but with the criminal			0
@entity12 was not naïve , or tacky , or any number of criticisms that have been and surely will be lobbed at her , for posing for provocative photos			0
she was a normal young woman			0
and i suspect that we 're more shocked by the fact that @entity30 had a glass of wine and posed naked for a boyfriend than the fact the image is now ours to see			0
we 've become accustomed to knowing everything about everyone			0
actress @entity168 , one of the victims , received responses to her tweet , " to those of you looking at photos i took with my husband years ago in the privacy of our home , hope you feel great about yourselves , " that echoed this sentiment : " @entity180 posing nude on camera , dummy			1
your husband not know what you look like nude ? ‪ # @entity186			0
" she has since gone silent on @entity187			0
the message , of course , is n't that it 's heinous to so publicly and maliciously invade someone 's privacy but that these women brought their misfortune on themselves			1
after all , it would n't have happened to them if they did n't take the photos			1
but the first step to protecting our privacy both online and off is n't to demand that @entity108 make a stronger @entity38 or to start stripping our storage spaces of anything private			1
nor is it to insist that women stop taking nude photos of themselves or , for that matter , stop engaging in any activity they would n't want to be made public			1
instead , it 's to take these crimes seriously and hold their executors accountable			0
the problem is n't the picture			2
it 's the perpetrator .			2

an anonymous poster put hundreds of nude photos of big celebs on message board
@entity223 : this is not just a violation of privacy ; it 's criminal invasion but hard to prosecute
she says the debate should be over making this *illegal* , not over taking nude photos
@entity223 : the problem is n't the *wisdom* of photos or hacking @entity38 ; it 's the perpetrator
