-- @entity1 is best known in tennis for his many successes as a doubles specialist , but now he 's playing a new role -- that of a double agent			1
the 37 - year - old @entity8 veteran is still a professional on the @entity9 , winning his latest doubles title in @entity11 earlier this month , but also acts as manager to two of @entity8 's brightest tennis hopes through his company @entity15			1
and with a host of @entity18 film stars also featuring in the firm 's portfolio , @entity1 has a ready - made route to success once his career on court comes to an end			1
@entity1 , who cites entrepreneurs such as @entity28 boss @entity27 and telecoms mogul @entity29 as businessmen he looks up to , has recently made his screen debut in one of his company 's latest projects			2
his wife , @entity35 , is an award - winning actress and was named @entity37 in 2000			2
when he does hang up his racket , the first player from @entity8 to win a grand slam title -- @entity1 now has 11 all in doubles formats -- aims to mix the glitz and glamor of @entity18 with a plan to boost the prospects of burgeoning tennis talent in the country			1
" all of us growing up are aware what support it takes to build a tennis player , " he told @entity0 's @entity48			0
" i do n't think there 's any dearth of talent in @entity8 -- we 've always had the best juniors in the world			2
" the big transition is how do you get from the juniors to the seniors , and that comes through financial support			0
" in the @entity64 the kids have coaches , trainers and a pretty robust support staff , so it takes a lot of money			0
" we have one kid we are supporting fulltime now			0
he 's 14 years old and very talented , so hopefully we can make it to where we help more and more kids and eventually there will be a pipeline of players coming out of the country			0
" outside of cricket , whose stars are worshiped in @entity8 , @entity1 is one of the country 's best known sporting figures			1
he has a clean sweep of grand slam titles in the mixed doubles , claiming his first crown at the @entity89 in 1997 with @entity91 partner @entity90 , and can also boast four men 's doubles titles to boot			1
at january 's @entity94 he partnered compatriot @entity95 -- with whom he recently won the @entity97 title -- but they were knocked out in round three			0
yet it is his partnership with another @entity8 player , @entity102 , that has reaped dividends			2
they have won three men 's doubles titles together -- at the @entity89 in 1999 and 2001 as well as @entity108 in 1999			1
even with a career that is still in full swing , @entity1 also acts as agent to @entity112 -- the first @entity8 woman to break into the world 's top 30 players -- and @entity115 , who reached a high of 62 in the men 's rankings last year			1
" for me it 's two fulltime jobs so i 've got to put in more work , but i really enjoy doing what i do , " he explained			0
" @entity112 was one of our first clients , i think we signed her when she was 15			0
" the tennis part of it is easy for me because i 'm on the road , i 'm networked into the tennis world , so doing her racket and apparel , this is very easy as i 'm there on site			0
" i 'm aware tennis is n't going to last forever , and this going to be a smooth and natural transition now because @entity138 is eight years old			0
" but though @entity18 is beckoning , @entity1 insists his eyes are still firmly fixed on court for now .			1
