-- president @entity1 used the @entity3 address to outline an agenda for the coming year and , more importantly , to define what his goals would be should he be re-elected in november			1
as @entity8 presidential candidates engage in a bitter civil war for the nomination to oppose him , @entity1 has stepped up at this moment to offer a blueprint to strengthen the middle class , diminish inequality and revitalize the economy			1
@entity1 has attempted to turn his source of weakness , the laggard condition of the economy , into his strength by going on the offensive about how to make things better			1
whereas @entity24 and other republicans have defined @entity1 's policies as a form of @entity29 socialism , @entity1 has argued that protecting the middle class is the only way to reclaim @entity33 values			1
the final @entity3 for a first - term president is always a mix of policy and politics			1
tuesday night , the president brought together a number of themes that have been shaping his speeches since september			2
the speech blended some of president @entity45 's harsh realism with president @entity47 's endless optimism			1
@entity1 warned of the growing economic divide between the wealthy and the rest of the nation			1
he spoke about the challenges that middle - class @entity33 , the backbone of our economy , face every day			2
whereas he started his presidency focused on the stability of financial institutions , now he has turned his attention to the stability of @entity33 families			0
he is no longer just talking about economic recovery			0
the remainder of his time in office , we know now , will be about economic revitalization			0
" think about the @entity33 within our reach , " the president proclaimed , " a country that leads the world in educating its people			2
an @entity33 that attracts a new generation of high - tech manufacturing and high - paying jobs			0
a future where we 're in control of our own energy , and our security and prosperity are n't so tied to unstable parts of the world			0
an economy built to last , where hard work pays off , and responsibility is rewarded			2
" rather than running away from @entity87 , president @entity1 embraced the historical value of government			1
he said : " during the @entity90 , @entity33 built the @entity91 and the @entity92			0
after @entity93 , we connected our states with a system of highways			0
@entity98 and @entity8 administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody , from the workers who built them to the businesses that still use them today			0
" the speech is certainly a good start to his re-election effort			1
it comes at a time when @entity111 's attacks on @entity24 have ironically fueled a critical discussion that emerged from @entity113 about the damaging consequences certain kinds of economic behavior can have and about the inequity of the tax system enabling some @entity33 to enjoy growing riches when so many others are struggling to get by			2
tuesday night @entity1 put himself squarely on the side of the middle class and economic fairness			2
but the speech is not a game changer			1
the truth is that the @entity3 address is not what it used to be			0
the reality is that fewer americans are tuned in given the endless menu of cable stations and websites that offer voters something else to see			0
moreover , economic conditions are still poor			0
even with some signs of progress , unemployment remains extremely high and household security is fragile			0
if voters are going to make their decision based on the health of the economy , many might very well decide to move toward the @entity8			0
given how difficult it has been for @entity147 to handle the most routine decision , voters will be skeptical about president @entity1 's ability to handle the kinds of issues he discussed in his speech			1
how can a president and @entity147 transform the infrastructure of the economy if they ca n't even pass regular appropriations bills without a high - stakes showdown ? a speech about economy and promises of policy are not the same as improved economic conditions			1
finally , in our short - attention - span political culture , speeches this far away from the election only have limited effect			0
what matters will be what the president is saying , what events are taking place , and how the @entity8 are doing in september and october			2
notwithstanding these limits , the speech is a good start in terms of outlining the issues that president @entity1 needs to emphasize if he is to excite @entity98 and attract independents			1
rather than entering in a defensive posture , focusing just on crisis and conflict , president @entity1 has instead chosen to define the terms of the debate and to offer a positive vision for the future			1
he has argued that the values of his administration are as @entity33 as apple pie			0
when the @entity8 are done squabbling among themselves and select a nominee , they will face the burden of offering a vision of their own rather than simply being the @entity196 alternative			0
then we will find out whether the @entity1 presidency , like the economy he discussed tuesday night , is built to last			1
follow @entity200 on @entity201 join the conversation on @entity203 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			2

@entity206 : president @entity1 's speech outlined a vision for his second term
he says the president placed emphasis on the economy and on *combating* inequity on taxes
the speech is not likely to be a game changer , he says
@entity206 : @entity1 's re-election bid will likely be decided by events and his actions next fall
