in a bold declaration of its ambition , the @entity0 in @entity1 and @entity2 has laid claim to leadership of the global @entity9 movement , calling on @entity10 worldwide to swear allegiance to its leader , @entity12			1
by claiming such preeminence , @entity13 is seeking to eclipse @entity15 and its leader , @entity16 , in what analysts see as the most dramatic shift in militant jihadism since 9/11			1
but @entity13 also makes the outlandish claims -- if its words are taken literally -- that it leads 1.5 billion @entity10 and that the world , not just the deserts of @entity2 and @entity1 , are its new stage			1
what did @entity13 say ? the declaration was made sunday in a 34 - minute audio message by @entity13 spokesman and ideologue @entity31 , who said that from now on , @entity13 would simply be called the " @entity0			1
" that is much more than a change of name ; it simultaneously strips away the geographical limits imposed by the previous name and underlines the movement 's control of a wide swath of territory in @entity1 and @entity2			1
it even suggests that the group should exercise authority over @entity47 's holiest places			0
in a direct challenge to @entity16 , @entity48 said it is now " incumbent upon all muslims to pledge allegiance to the @entity54 and support him			1
" @entity54 is the name now given to @entity56 , a secretive figure never seen in @entity13 ' voluminous propaganda output			0
@entity48 says that @entity56 has accepted the pledge of allegiance offered by senior figures of the " @entity0			1
" " thus he is the imam and @entity64 everywhere , " @entity48 concluded with stunning brevity			0
why a caliphate matters @entity48 said that in the areas now controlled by the group , the legality of all states and organizations becomes null and void , an assertion that the colonial - era borders of the @entity74 are no longer valid			1
instead , they are replaced by a caliphate carved from @entity13 ' recent territorial gains			0
a video released by the group sunday underlined the point in graphic fashion , showing the destruction of a border crossing between @entity84 in @entity2 and the @entity1 province of @entity86			1
@entity13 also released a series of photographs purporting to show a parade through its @entity2 stronghold of @entity91 in celebration of the declaration and of the @entity54			1
the restoration of the caliphate was the dream of @entity15 leader @entity97 in establishing @entity15 , but @entity13 has seized more territory , and more cities , than any @entity15 affiliate			1
@entity101 briefly took control of a string of towns in southern @entity105 early in 2012 but was driven out of them later that year			0
@entity13 ' methods -- especially its habit of summary executions -- and its refusal to accept @entity16 's authority have also led to a very public and bitter rupture with the parent organization			0
@entity13 was disowned by @entity15 in february after defying @entity16 's demand that it cease operating in @entity2 in favor of another @entity15 affiliate , @entity116			1
@entity101 's @entity117 said that @entity13 was " not a branch of the @entity15 group ... does not have an organizational relationship with it , and @entity15 is not responsible for their action			1
" but the group 's successes have shifted the balance			0
in language that appears to taunt @entity15 and @entity116 , @entity48 said sunday : " they never recognized the @entity0 to begin with , although @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 acknowledge its existence			1
... should we consult those who have abandoned us ? those who have betrayed us ? those who have disowned us and incited against us ? " different from @entity15 @entity135 , a fellow at the @entity136 , said the impact of the announcement " will be global as @entity15 affiliates and independent jihadist groups must now definitively choose to support and join the @entity0 or to oppose it			1
" " while it is now inevitable that members and prominent supporters of @entity15 and its affiliates will rapidly move to denounce @entity56 and this announcement , it is the long - term implications that may prove more significant , " @entity135 says			2
@entity101 's declining potency in its @entity155 - @entity154 heartland , the death of @entity97 and the group 's fracturing into semiautonomous franchises have left a new generation of jihadists looking for a spiritual home -- and a field of combat			1
@entity13 provides that , and it has a slick propaganda machine producing high - quality videos posted on social media			2
but @entity135 says : " @entity101 will retain considerable support , and once the dust has settled , we will very likely find ourselves in a dualistic position of having two competing international jihadist representatives : @entity15 , with a now more locally focused and gradual approach to success , and the ' @entity0 , ' with a hunger for rapid results and total hostility for competition			1
" @entity135 said @entity13 has evolved as a tightly controlled group with " an almost obsessive level of bureaucracy , account - keeping , and centrally controlled but locally implemented military - political coordination			2
" but unlike @entity15 , it has also " developed an increasingly efficient model of governance , capable of simultaneously implementing harsh medieval justice and a whole range of modern social services			0
" to @entity186 , senior fellow at the @entity187 , the question is : " how can they create governance structures that do n't completely chafe against the social fabric of these towns ? " @entity13 has grown exponentially over the last four years , taking advantage of ungoverned space and violent @entity196 - @entity195 sectarianism to win the attention and support of thousands of would - be jihadists			2
it has attracted hundreds and probably thousands of fighters from across the @entity203 world and @entity204			0
even so , its forces are spread across a huge area and would be vastly outnumbered and outgunned by the @entity1 military should it reorganize into an effective force			0
and @entity13 depends on powerful @entity195 tribes to the west and north of @entity211 as its hosts and partners			0
if they perceive its practices as too draconian or its caliphate as marginalizing them , the tolerance they have shown in the face of a common enemy -- the government of @entity1 prime minister @entity219 -- will soon evaporate			0
what happens in @entity2 ? one of the biggest questions is how other groups in @entity2 respond			0
one smaller @entity2 faction , @entity226 , has already declared its allegiance to the " @entity228			2
" at a local level , some @entity116 fighters pledged allegiance to @entity13 before it declared the caliphate			2
" we unified with @entity13 to stop bloodshed and spare our region and its countryside the danger of war and displacement , " said @entity116 's leader in the eastern town of @entity235			0
but other @entity116 elements clashed with @entity13 in the town monday and seem to be still working with other factions , even the relatively secular @entity245 , in @entity246 , a province where @entity13 is strong			0
most analysts foresee an inconsistent mix of competition and coexistence , even cooperation between the two groups , whose ideological roots are similar			0
but many @entity10 see the declaration of a caliphate as both apostasy and a ludicrous overreach by @entity13			2
the @entity2 opposition council in @entity259 , an important area in the battle against the regime of @entity2 president @entity262 , last week attacked any notion that @entity13 could form a state			2
" @entity13 must delete the world ' state ' from the name of the faction and to be jihadi faction because @entity13 does not have tangible or religious structure , " the council said , in a statement obtained by the @entity267			0
a spokesman for the @entity245 in eastern @entity2 , @entity275 , described the declaration of the caliphate as " unbelievable			0
" " there are millions of @entity2 who are not with @entity13 , so how can they speak about a caliphate in our land ? " he said			2
@entity13 declares ' caliphate ' stretching across @entity1 and @entity2			1

the @entity0 in @entity1 and @entity2 has laid claim to leadership of the global @entity9 movement
in a challenge to the head of @entity15 , @entity13 calls on " all @entity10 to pledge allegiance " to its leader
in essence , the group is saying the colonial - era borders of the @entity74 are no longer valid
analyst : @entity101 affiliates , other jihadists must now choose whether to back or *reject* @entity13
