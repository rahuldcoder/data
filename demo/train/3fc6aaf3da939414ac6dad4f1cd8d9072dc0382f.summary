-- @entity1 -- an economic giant of the eurozone -- is failing on the global stage and must adapt if it is to survive , the head of coffee giant @entity6 has warned			1
@entity7 , ceo of @entity8 - headquartered @entity6 , told @entity0 his country 's woes would be " just the beginning of our problems " unless its businesses learned to compete in the international marketplace -- something they had largely failed to do			1
" the @entity1 economy is wrong in the sense that it is not conscious enough about how important it is to become competitive in the global arena , " he said			1
" let 's say we do n't really step up : what we have suffered until now ... is just the beginning of our problems			2
" @entity1 's economy makes up 17 % of the eurozone -- almost three times that of bailed - out @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 combined -- and , as the third - largest economy in the bloc , is regarded as " too big to fail			1
" @entity7 's comments come as the borrowing costs of @entity33 , another pillar of the bloc , push toward 6 % , feeding fears the debt crisis is spreading to larger economies			2
@entity1 's borrowing costs passed the psychological 7 % level -- beyond which countries are considered unable to fund themselves -- last november , before dropping back			1
according to @entity7 , @entity1 businesses have been slow to adapt to the demands of a globalized economy -- unlike many @entity48 businesses , for example , which had aggressively pursued a path of international expansion through creating foreign partnerships			1
" some entrepreneurs did it : few , not enough , " he said			2
" in the meantime , the relative size of the @entity1 industries in most of the sectors has been declining			1
" he said the far - reaching reforms being implemented by new prime minister @entity59 were " absolutely " necessary for @entity1 to regain its economic vitality			1
" this country needs a break in @entity1 politics in order to reform , " he said			1
" otherwise there will be no growth			0
" @entity7 is the grandson of @entity67 , who developed the modern espresso machine and founded the company in @entity8 in 1933			0
today , @entity6 sells its products in more than 130 countries around the world			2
the company faced a significant challenge in competing " in a more crowded , competitive market arena , " he said			0
but , conversely , " opportunities are becoming much larger , " he added			0
he saw a strong future for the company in the premium sector of the coffee market , which had undergone significant changes in the past decade or so			0
previously , he said , the market had been " the shape of an anvil ... with a big mainstream part and a very small narrow premium coffee segment			0
" today , he said , it was more like an hourglass , with a substantial market for premium , specialty coffees			0
" this is the future , " he said			0
" it will be more and more high quality , like wine			0
" being an internationally competitive coffee brand did not mean aiming to have as many outlets as @entity97 , he said			2
" i would like to have 1 % of what they have , but to reach the same awareness			0
