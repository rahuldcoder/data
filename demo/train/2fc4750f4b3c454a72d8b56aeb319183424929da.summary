holding a shotgun and shooting skeet , the @entity3 candidate out to topple @entity4 leader @entity4 attempts to flip the script in a new television ad			1
the ad shows @entity8 blasting away , then pops in a picture of @entity10 brandishing a gun upside down over his head at the @entity14 earlier this year			1
" @entity4 , that 's not how you hold a gun , " @entity8 says			1
@entity8 is not @entity18 , she says , no matter what @entity10 " wants you to think			1
" " @entity4 was the same guy who thought @entity21 basketball players were @entity22			0
" that reference is to a @entity10 campaign ad that mistakenly placed video of @entity27 's basketball team celebrating a 2010 @entity29 championship win instead of the @entity31 ' 2012 win			2
@entity10 has painted a vote for @entity8 as a vote for @entity18 , and a @entity36 / @entity35 poll from earlier this month showed about two - thirds of @entity39 voters harbor an unfavorable view of the president			1
@entity10 's pitch is that the only way to alter the balance of power in @entity45 is through a @entity48 @entity47 takeover on @entity49 that would put him in charge -- if he can beat @entity8 , who would be @entity39 's first woman senator			1
@entity36 poll : @entity10 holds slim edge in biggest @entity47 race of 2014 @entity8 says in the new ad that @entity10 is " attacking me on coal after doing nothing while we 've lost thousands of coal jobs			2
" @entity10 has vowed to roll back @entity18 regulations that @entity48 loathe , especially @entity61 rules on coal that @entity63 see as harmful to their coal - rich economy			2
" he even said it 's not his job to bring jobs to @entity39 , " she says in the ad before firing another shot			0
2014 midterm elections : @entity47 races " i 'm not @entity18 , " she says , " i disagree with him on guns , coal and the @entity61			0
the ad is reminiscent of then - @entity80 candidate @entity79 's 2010 tv ad that showed him shooting a cap and trade bill with a rifle			0
his @entity48 opponent had painted him as a surrogate for @entity18			0
the @entity47 @entity85 went on to win .			0

@entity88 candidate tries to *separate* herself from president @entity18
@entity8 takes shots at clay *pigeons* and opponent @entity4
