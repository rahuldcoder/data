-- just when you think derogatory stereotypes about dads are on the decline as fathers take a more hands - on role in child - rearing , along comes an online posting by a major brand that shows not everyone got the memo			2
and this one -- published , then pulled , by @entity14 -- charts new terrain in depicting first - time fathers as clueless buffoons			1
" saying ' no - no ' is not just for baby			0
like dogs or other house pets , new dads are filled with good intentions but lacking the judgment and fine motor skills to execute well , " it reads			2
somehow , it manages to get even more offensive from there			0
the list of " 6 mistakes new dads make " begins with a father taking his child for a walk in " a cold , brisk , rain - soaked stroller " and only after 10 minutes beginning to wonder " why is this baby crying so much ? " at that point , he notices his child is wearing " a short - sleeved summer onesie			1
" he 's also likely to put his child 's clothes on backwards and not understand why they fit wrong			0
he lets baby eat off the floor -- so , the web post cautions , " at least get him to enforce a 5 - second rule			2
" he fails to notice the food -- or , worse , @entity48 -- all over his baby 's face , let alone wipe it off			0
then he gives his child inappropriate screen time , plopping the baby down in front of " reality shows			0
" parental outcry led @entity14 to reexamine the wisdom of the post			1
the company pulled the page from its website , but did not post a statement in response to the uproar			1
when i asked for comment , the company sent me this brief statement : " this article was written by a dad for other dads to make a lighthearted comparison between bachelor lives and new parent lives			1
we took the article down based on feedback and we know how seriously dads take their parental responsibilities			1
" the post included some classic insults : " @entity80 wo n't stop @entity81 from relaxing with a brew and blaring inappropriate shows while baby stares in horror / awe / wonder at the colorful moving yell - box			2
tell @entity81 to embrace parental sacrifice and crack a book			0
" finally , to top off this glorious work of wisdom and respect , the post states , " some new dads have been inspired by raunchy comedies to bring babies to inappropriate places like casinos , pool halls , and poetry readings			1
" yes , you read that correctly			0
well , at least it 's clear where @entity14 got the inspiration for these stereotypes : fiction			1
" none of these places are healthy for baby , " the post continues			2
" if dad needs persuading , just tell him that babies are terrible tippers and can never make bank shots			2
so , to summarize , new dads give our kids dirty food and @entity48 to spread all over their faces while watching " @entity121 , " then put them in backward summer clothes in freezing weather , oblivious to their cries en route to a poetry slam			1
but you ca n't blame us , because of our perpetually beer - soaked state and canine - level motor skills			0
dads and moms wasted no time giving @entity14 a piece of their minds			1
" this may be the dumbest thing i 've ever read , " @entity134 wrote on @entity135			0
" me want to comment but me two dum , " wrote @entity138			0
@entity140 called it " beyond unacceptable , " and asked how anyone at @entity14 thought " depicting dads in this manner would be received in a positive light			1
" " as a woman , a single mother , and a feminist , i find this ' article ' disturbing on so many levels , " wrote @entity146			2
" perpetuating unfounded gender stereotypes is deplorable and insulting			0
" @entity153 inquired about a job , saying that since he 's been primary caregiver to his boys for 13 years , he must be " one of the smartest men you might ever meet			0
" @entity81 bloggers had a field day			0
@entity161 of @entity162 said he generally steers clear of complaints about portrayals of dads , but this was " over the top			2
" " if @entity14 were to assign the same ' 6 mistakes ' to any other sex , race , or group -- there would be major hell to pay , " he wrote			1
@entity174 at @entity175 envisioned dads saying , " i would complain to @entity14 about that thing , but i 'm too busy betting on red			1
the baby loves it when i bet on red ! " it 's not the first time an insulting depiction of dads comes from a dad			0
last year , @entity187 took action after an ad infuriated people			0
part of the company 's response was a @entity135 post from a father , using his first name only , who said he was responsible for the ad			1
@entity14 did not say who wrote this " 6 mistakes " piece , who approved it for the website , or whether officials have any assessment of it now			1
in an e-mail exchange , spokeswoman @entity207 said it was " a piece of web content written by a freelance humor writer who helps us on a number of projects			0
... we have enormous respect for parents , moms and dads , as they make their way through the early years of parenting			1
we 're in new territory with today 's modern families and changing family roles and we appreciate all feedback to help us get it right			0
" @entity174 says this one web page does not reflect @entity14 's actions in general			1
" i know you know better because i 've seen the carefully crafted ads that you 've produced that try to recognize dads as user of your products , who might be goofy , but at least are n't idiots , " he wrote in an open message to @entity14 on his blog			1
" i 've seen you engage with some of the brightest voices in the dad - sphere on campaigns that seek to include dads into the picture in a positive way			0
i know you know better because you are a company made up of people who are moms and dads that know better what modern families look like			2
" some people argue that dads , and people of all groups , need to lighten up about stereotypes in general			0
" the problem these days is everyone has lost their sense of humor , " @entity258 wrote on @entity259 last year			0
but others say the stereotypes send bad messages to boys and girls , and contribute to assumptions made in society and the court system that dads are n't as good caregivers as mothers			2
as far as angry parents are concerned , this " 6 mistakes " post boils down to one big one by @entity14			1
update : after this story published , @entity14 published a note on @entity135 saying that the post was actually an effort to " poke fun at the caricature of ' the hapless dad			1
' " however , there was no suggestion in the piece that it was making fun of a caricature , and @entity14 did not say that when i asked about the piece			1
the @entity135 note says , " to some of you it did n't come across that way and we apologize			0
" what do you think ? weigh in in the comments below , or join the discussions on @entity135 and @entity303 .			0

update : @entity14 stated the post was a caricature and apologized again after this article published
@entity14 posted ' 6 mistakes new dads make ' as a humorous list on its website
the post said new dads are bad at dressing , feeding and tending their kids
after parents took the company to task , @entity14 removed the post from its website
