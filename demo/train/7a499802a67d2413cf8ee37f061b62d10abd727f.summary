@entity0 , @entity1 -- twenty - four weeks pregnant , @entity3 went to the emergency room last october with a hacking cough that made it hard to breathe			2
tests found she had h1n1 flu , and doctors put her in a coma so her body could continue the gestational process without expending additional energy			2
" my life changed forever after that , " @entity3 said			2
six weeks later -- 10 weeks before full term -- her unborn baby 's vital signs dropped and doctors performed an emergency c - section			2
" when i woke up , my husband said , ' we had to take out the baby ' and i immediately clutched my stomach , fearing the worst , " she said			0
" but he settled me down and [ said ] , ' he 's ok , he 's down in the @entity25			0
" born 2Â½ months early , @entity26 weighed less than 3 pounds and was immediately put in the neonatal intensive care unit ( @entity25 ) -- a vital step for premature babies but often financially and emotionally stressful for families			1
the @entity31 found some relief with the help of dr. @entity34 and his nonprofit @entity35			1
the group provides financial assistance for items such as housing and medical expenses , baby supplies and transportation costs			1
" to see people hearing there 's something wrong with their baby , and then to worry about everything around them -- i mean , life does n't stop			0
you still have to make your mortgage payments , " said @entity34 , 41			1
an obstetrician specializing in high - risk pregnancies since 2002 , @entity34 had watched families struggle to cope with the financial pressures of having a child in the @entity25			1
but in 2004 , his wife had complications with her pregnancy that threatened both her and her unborn child			0
though @entity34 had the medical knowledge , support and financial stability to delay a very premature birth -- his daughter was ultimately born six weeks early -- the experience shook him and gave him a new perspective of what his patients go through			1
" what we went through was so traumatic , but it 's nothing compared to many of my patients , " he said			0
" i wanted to take some of the suffering that these women go through away from them so they can really focus on their baby			0
" for years , @entity34 gave patients money out of his own pocket before he started @entity35 in november 2009			1
now most of the group 's funding comes from individual donors and small corporate sponsors			1
so far , it has helped 80 families in @entity1 and across the country , including the @entity31			1
" they helped us with our mortgage , with gas , " said @entity3 's husband , @entity88			1
" it was huge for us			0
" families apply for assistance from @entity35 through hospital social workers			2
the application requires proof of financial need , and the baby must be in the @entity25 for at least two weeks			2
the group has n't rejected anyone yet			2
" these are families that ... [ are ] in a time of crisis [ and ] now need extra help			2
and that 's what we 're about , " @entity34 said			1
while families supported by the group are primarily located in southern @entity1 , they do not have to live in the area to receive aid			1
families in the @entity117 , @entity118 and on the @entity119 have been helped by the program			1
the average amount a family receives is $ 1,200 ; it can be more depending on circumstances			0
so far , @entity35 has provided a total of $ 70,000 in assistance			0
if the group 's monetary support left an impression on families , so has @entity34 's compassion			1
" dr. @entity34 made me feel very at ease , " said first - time parent @entity131 , who at just 24 weeks pregnant had to have an emergency c - section earlier this month due to excessive bleeding			1
" he made me feel like everything was going to be ok , even though it could have gone tragic in a matter of seconds			0
" with her less - than - 2 - pound daughter @entity139 hooked up to a breathing apparatus and several ivs , @entity131 said , " it 's hard seeing her struggle			0
... you do n't think all these problems are going to happen			0
but it 's all real life now and it is really hard			0
" miracle babies helped ease some of that suffering for @entity131 and her partner , @entity150			1
the organization paid for housing near the hospital so they would n't have to travel hours each day to be with their daughter -- something they could n't have afforded on their own			0
for @entity34 , the main goal is to help these families be happy , healthy and together			1
" i want to see others be happy			0
... that 's what drives me , that 's what makes me get up in the mornings ... that 's what makes me want to do more , " he said			0
" i ca n't think of really any other time in one 's life where you need someone to be there for you			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity35 website and see how to help .			0
