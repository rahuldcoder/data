when you were young , what did you dream of being " when you grew up " ? is it what you 've ended up doing ? you may dismiss those childhood aspirations as unrealistic now you 're an adult with responsibilities and bills to pay , but that role reflected what you enjoyed doing and who you were at that time			1
" the dream jobs we aspire to as children are a window into our passions and talents , " says @entity12 's career expert @entity11			1
" identifying and understanding those passions are key to improving our performance and enjoyment of the jobs we currently do , even if they are n't specific to the careers we dreamed of as kids			1
" so , what influences our childhood aspirations ? " when we 're small most of us have a limited idea of what 's out there , " explains career coach @entity28			1
" it is shaped by the exposure we have -- the people that have a big impact on us and the standards and social expectations around us "			1
our families greatly influence our outlook on life			0
if we look up to one family member in particular , we tend to be drawn to their careers as we want to be like them			0
indeed , when @entity28 was a little girl , she wanted to be a librarian because her grandmother , who she admired , was one			0
and it 's not just our relatives ' roles at work that can influence children 's aspirations			1
the gender roles that our parents take on at home can also dramatically impact our childhood career choices			2
a study by @entity58 , of the @entity59 , found that the division of labor at home had implications for how girls ' identities developed in gender roles			0
@entity58 told @entity0 that fathers ' behavior around the house seems to be " predicting their daughter 's career aspirations " beyond what they " might be publicly endorsing or specifically saying about gender roles			1
" she found that if fathers talked about supporting gender equality but did n't take on an equal role in domestic tasks then this sent conflicting signals to their daughters , which led to daughters placing more weight on their father 's actions , rather than his words			1
by contrast , where fathers demonstrated their beliefs in gender equality by taking on an equal distribution of domestic tasks then their daughters would select roles " that are more gender neutral or even sort of male - stereotypic like being a scientist or athlete , " @entity58 says			0
and that could have a major impact on our pay check down the line			0
research by the @entity102 , published in the journal @entity104 , found that girls who aspired to traditionally female - dominated occupations were far more likely to earn lower wages in their first job , since stereotypically " female " jobs tend to pay less			1
" stereotypically ' male ' or ' female ' preferences that children exhibit during childhood continue into , and affect , their adult lives , " says @entity110 , professor of social policy and sociology at @entity102			1
our early experiences can also have a bearing on what we see as our " dream job " -- a positive experience linked to a potential career can be hugely inspiring			1
" i went through an intense marine biologist phase fueled by a life - changing snorkeling expedition when i was seven years old , " reveals @entity122 , co-founder and co-ceo of beauty start - up @entity124			2
and inspiration can also strike at school , if we learn about a career that resonates with us			0
" when i was in the 4th grade [ aged 9 - 10 ] i learned about lobbyists			0
i thought it would be amazing job to try and influence important issues , " says @entity133 , head of partnerships at @entity135			2
when we are young , our aspirations are a response to our circumstances ; but @entity28 says that when the time comes to start " designing " our careers we begin tuning in to what we feel " compelled to express " about ourselves			2
@entity145 , founder of @entity146 , started out with a long and varied list of possible careers -- she went through phases of wanting to be a teacher ( like her mother ) , a police officer , an astronaut and an attorney			0
" only in high school when i began programming computers , did i become interested in tech and start - ups , which led me to attend @entity159 and major in @entity160 , " she says			0
while many of us turn our backs on our childhood ambitions when faced with the realities of life as a " grown - up , " some really do end up in their dream jobs			1
a survey of the childhood career aspirations of more than 8,000 professionals from around the world , carried out for social networking site @entity12 , found that 30.3 % of the site 's members were either currently in the job they had always dreamed of , or in a career linked to those plans			1
creator and presenter of @entity181 is one of those living out her early dreams			0
" even as an eight - year - old , swinging ponytails et al , i would wave around my plastic mic and scrawl little ' scripts ' to deliver to a pretend audience ! " she says			0
" when i was fifteen , i announced with assured clarity to my family that my ' dream job ' was to be a producer and tv journalist			1
" sometimes our careers begin at such an early age that there 's little to think about			2
four - time @entity199 champion @entity198 started swimming when she was five ; by the time she was eight she was competing against able - bodied children			2
" i 'm not sure i thought too much on what career i was interested in when i was a child , " she says			0
" i always just wanted to have a farm and work with horses when i was very young , though the thought of working with children is something i 've thought about since			2
" i 'm very fortunate that my swimming career took off when i was very young , so it was never really a question			0
" but no matter how early we step on to that treadmill , it 's never too late to change tack ; thinking back to our childhood ambitions can help us work out which aspects of our current job we love			1
after @entity122 's marine biologist phase passed , she says , " i never had a single career in mind			2
i always pictured myself being able to do many things at once : engineer , @entity225 , investment banker , professional skier , magazine editor ... " i have n't checked the box on any of those specifically , [ but ] i feel lucky that my current role blends a lot of different disciplines			0
" when we were children , our aspirations were limitless and anything seemed possible ; by recapturing that excitement and allowing it to inform your research and networking , 2015 could be the year you find your dream job			1
