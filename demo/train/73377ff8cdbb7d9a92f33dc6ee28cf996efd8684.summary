-- a well - publicized estimate that @entity3 killed 10,000 people in the @entity5 is " too much , " and the death toll likely is closer to 2,000 or 2,500 , president @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity7 on tuesday			1
" we 're hoping to be able to contact something like 29 municipalities left wherein we still have to establish their numbers , especially for the missing , but so far 2,000 , about 2,500 , is the number we are working on as far as deaths are concerned , " he said			0
the monster storm left behind a catastrophic scene after it made landfall on six @entity5 islands last friday , leaving many without access to food and medical care			0
at least 800,000 people have been displaced , the @entity23 said tuesday			0
by tuesday , @entity5 officials said 1,774 bodies had been counted and 2,487 people were injured			2
the previous estimate of 10,000 killed , @entity1 said , came from local officials who perhaps were " too close " to the center of destruction to make an accurate guess			1
the typhoon simply overwhelmed the ability of two or three local governments to do their jobs , which include taking care of the initial response , the president said			1
for example , in @entity41 , only 20 of 290 police were available when disaster struck ; many were tending to their own families , he said			1
the national government " had to replace a lot of the personnel with personnel from other regions to take care of government 's vital functions , " @entity1 said			1
the typhoon wreaked havoc on power lines and communications facilities , which meant government officials faced immense difficulties in identifying needs and dispatching relief supplies and equipment			1
but the situation has improved , he said			0
all of the national roads are reopened and most of the airports are nearly back to normal operating levels , he said			0
still , he added , the sheer number of people affected is daunting			0
@entity1 said the toll might have been higher had it not been for preemptive evacuations , the prepositioning of supplies and cooperation from businesses			1
" but , of course , nobody imagined the magnitude that this super typhoon brought on us , " he said			2
@entity1 expressed gratitude for the aid that has been pouring in from around the world			1
" there are , at last count , over 22 countries have either pledged to us , actually given us aid , " he said			0
though civil order has broken down in some areas , some 2,000 personnel have been deployed to restore it , he said			0
" people were -- became -- desperate , and that 's why we are trying to fast - track the situation where national government takes over these local government functions so that order is restored			2
" responding to a question about the vulnerability of his country to climate change , @entity1 said he had no doubt that climate change is occurring and the world must respond to it			1
" there should be no debate that this is happening , " he said , citing heavy rains during what used to be dry months , periods of drought during what used to be wet months and the havoc that that has inflicted on farmers			0
" we all live on one planet , " the president said			1
" either we come up with a solution that everybody adheres to and cooperates with , or let us be prepared to meet disasters			0
" efforts are under way to better prepare the archipelago nation to endure future such assaults , such as planting mangroves in tidal areas as a defense against tsunamis , and investing in meteorology to better predict -- and prepare for -- such events			2
after the immediate needs of the populace are met , the nation 's focus will turn to rebuilding the tens of thousands of homes affected -- this time to standards better able to withstand typhoons , @entity1 said .			2

" we all live on one planet , " says @entity1 , calling for the world to act on climate change
