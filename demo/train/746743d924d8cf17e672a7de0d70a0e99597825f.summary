@entity0 -- @entity3 mayor @entity2 , an @entity4 , joins several leading @entity5 , @entity6 and other @entity4 political leaders in the launch of a new group that hopes to find non-partisan solutions to some of the nation 's problems and to impact the next @entity15 session			1
the organization , known as @entity17 , kicked off monday in @entity3 with a series of panels discussing some key political problems in @entity21 , such as hyper - partisanship and electoral reform			1
during the day the group 's leaders and speakers explore how it can help find common ground to help solve those and other issues			1
besides @entity32 , among those participating in the kick - off : sens. @entity33 , @entity34 ; @entity35 , @entity36 - @entity3 ; @entity37 , @entity38 ; @entity39 , @entity40 ; reps			1
@entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 , @entity46 - @entity45 ; former @entity6 congressman @entity47 and @entity48 @entity49 governor @entity48 , who ran for @entity50 this year as an @entity4			1
later in the day during the kick - off event @entity32 is expected to speak about non-partisan redistricting			2
" parties have a place , but party loyalty , i do n't think , should get in the way of doing what you as an elected official believes what 's right			2
i think that 's what most of the public wants , " @entity2 told @entity63 's @entity64 sunday			2
led by columnist and @entity1 contributor @entity69 , @entity6 political consultant @entity71 , @entity5 consultant @entity72 , and veteran @entity5 fundraiser @entity73 who conceived the idea , the @entity17 group aims to look at politics through a new prism and wants to urge political leaders not to abandon their political labels but set them aside in order help find solutions			1
" no labels will create a space where ideas can be judged on the merits , not their conformity to pre-fabricated stereotypes			1
the point is not whether @entity21 moves left or right ; it 's whether we move forward			2
and that 's what the majority of @entity21 are yearning for , " the group described as its mission			1
veteran political analyst @entity94 of the @entity95 said it will be difficult for this type of group to change the political dynamics			1
" they are obviously confronting very strong head winds , " he told @entity1 but added " why not throw something into the mix. " @entity32 grabbed national headlines and renewed talk he might mount an independent run for the presidency in 2012 with a high profile speech last week saying government needs to chart " a middle way " to help fix the economy and criticized the partisanship in today 's government			1
" the country is growing more and more frustrated with government 's inability to keep @entity21 prosperous and fair and more skeptical that the jobs we need are coming soon			2
as families struggle to get by , they have seen little but partisan gridlock , political pandering and legislative influence - peddling , " @entity2 said as he outlined steps to tackle unemployment , spur job creation and push growth			1
" both parties follow the mood of the moment -- instead of leading from the front			2
they incite anger instead of addressing it -- for their own partisan interests			2
" @entity32 's participation in the @entity17 group is helping to stoke the speculation			1
" you can see why @entity32 is involved , " @entity94 told @entity1			0
it helps " to create a market for an independent candidacy			0
" " we have seen these efforts before to explore some alternative , a third party candidacy ... they have n't gone anywhere , " @entity94 added			0
on sunday @entity32 denied any intentions of seeking the presidency			0
" i 'm not going to run for president , the job			0
i have a great job			0
i 'm going to finish my 1,100 whatever number of days it is left go to , and i 'll leave the politics to the experts , " he told @entity63 's @entity64			0
when pressed he repeated his stance			0
" i 'm not looking at the possibility of running			0
i 've got a great job			0
and i 'm going to stay with this			0
" recently there have been some bipartisan initiatives in @entity0 to try to come up with solutions particularly regarding the nation 's growing debt , including the presidentially appointed commission			0
however , political experts are doubtful those initiatives will result in any concrete action in the near future			1
" i am skeptical of any short - term agreement between the two parties on the big fiscal questions confronting the country			0
there are real differences " that will have to be argued out in the political process , @entity94 said			1
with the @entity6 taking control of the @entity182 next month , it is unclear whether @entity0 's partisan atmosphere will improve because of necessity or get worse			0
@entity186 political science professor @entity185 pointed to the compromise for the temporary extension of the @entity190 - era tax cuts reached by the @entity182 and congressional @entity6 as a sign compromise is possible			1
as for the new @entity17 group , @entity185 for one said it could help			2
" if they are trying to join the crowd let 's work together rather than sink together , i think they will be widely perceived as doing something useful , " he told @entity1			0
" i think they add to kind of a groundswell of recognition " that government officials should strive for that type of cooperation			0
both @entity94 and @entity185 said any effort that could help bring some honesty and clarity to the political debate will help the process			2
group officials say they expect more than 1,000 ordinary citizens from all 50 states to participate in the launch event monday			1
they are aiming to build chapters in all 435 congressional districts			0
polls after the mid-term election show @entity21 want political leaders to reach across the political aisle to get things done			1
forty - seven percent said it is more important to compromise to get things done than to stick to their beliefs , according to a @entity227 - @entity226 poll last month			0
according to state registration statistics , about a quarter of @entity21 on average consider themselves as independent			0
in several states the number of people registered as independents tops those affiliated with either political party : @entity236 , @entity40 , @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 and @entity240			1
