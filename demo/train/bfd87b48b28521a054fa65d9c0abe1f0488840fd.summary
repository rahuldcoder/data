@entity0 -- @entity6 financier @entity5 will not accept any plea bargain and " wo n't plead guilty to anything " in the sex crimes case against him , one of his attorneys told @entity1 on thursday			1
attorney @entity10 made the remarks a day after @entity5 's legal team met with prosecutors in the case for nearly two hours			1
it 's not known if any plea deal was offered			2
the meeting came about a week after manhattan district attorney @entity18 acknowledged that there are questions about the credibility of @entity5 's accuser			1
the 62 - year - old former chief of the @entity24 is charged with sexual abuse and attempted rape of a hotel maid in may			0
while wednesday 's meeting with prosecutors was " constructive , " @entity5 's attorneys said , prosecutors maintained that they are not ready to drop the charges			1
" the investigative process is continuing , and no decisions have been made , " said @entity33 spokeswoman @entity33			1
the accuser 's civil attorney has called on @entity18 to recuse himself from prosecuting the case and appoint a special prosecutor			1
" we make this request in order to protect the integrity of the prosecution of mr. @entity5 , to ensure the victim 's rights are not further prejudiced by deliberate acts seeking to undermine her credibility , to insulate your office from the appearance of conflict of interest , and to ensure that future victims of sex crimes , regardless of their backgrounds , are not dissuaded from coming forward , " attorney @entity40 wrote in a four - page letter to @entity18			1
but @entity33 said @entity18 will not recuse himself			1
" any suggestion that this office should be recused is wholly without merit , " she said in a statement			0
@entity40 told @entity1 his client has admitted mistakes , but says that has nothing to do with what happened in @entity5 's hotel suite			1
" despite everything , " he told @entity1 tuesday , " she wants to get on the witness stand			0
that 's all she asks for			2
" last week , @entity18 indicated that the 32 - year - old accuser had been less than truthful with authorities about some aspects of her life and her whereabouts immediately after the alleged attack may 14 at the @entity79 hotel			2
@entity40 said wednesday that @entity18 's office " apparently has been responsible " for leaks to the news media " that were intended to discredit the victim 's character and , perhaps most importantly , undermine her charges against mr. @entity5			1
" he cited a telephone call he received june 30 from chief assistant district attorney @entity87 , informing him of the prosecutor 's decision to turn over to the defense " certain false statements " that the victim had made to investigators			1
during the call , he said @entity87 told him about an audio recording obtained by the prosecution in which the alleged victim told a boyfriend jailed in @entity99 a day after the alleged attack " about the possible benefits " of pursuing charges against @entity5			1
" when i asked mr. @entity87 specifically about what the victim had allegedly said during that conversation , he stated that the victim said ' words to the effect ' that ' this guy has a lot of money			0
i know what i 'm doing			0
' " @entity40 said that @entity87 then agreed to turn over a copy of the recording or allow him and the alleged victim to listen to it but , more than six days later , had failed to do so			0
" i am told by mr. @entity87 that the victim must now wait for the prosecutor 's interpreter to prepare a complete transcript of it , " @entity40 wrote			2
he went on to complain that , within a few hours of that call , the @entity119 reported on the " alleged conversation with the incarcerated individual , " in an article that cited " ' two well - placed law enforcement officials			0
' " @entity40 said he believes those officials work for @entity18			0
the alleged victim , meanwhile , has filed a libel lawsuit against the @entity127 and five of its reporters after the newspaper reported that the woman was a prostitute , according to court filings			0
the @entity127 said it stands by its reporting			0
a source with knowledge of the investigation told @entity1 that so far , " no evidence has been found that she is a prostitute			0
" the developments in @entity0 come as @entity5 faces separate accusations of attempted rape in @entity6 , which were filed in a complaint by @entity6 writer @entity143			2
a @entity5 lawyer in @entity6 said he has filed a counterclaim against @entity146 for " false declarations			2
" @entity1 's @entity148 contributed to this report .			0
