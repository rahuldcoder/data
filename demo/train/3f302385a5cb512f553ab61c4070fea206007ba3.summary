" we have so many gifted kids			2
they want more out of life			2

" in addition to promoting education , @entity49 makes it mandatory that children commit to 200 hours of community service a year			1
they also have to write an essay about how to improve their neighborhoods			0
" you have to keep that community base , " said @entity49 , who the children call @entity143			1
