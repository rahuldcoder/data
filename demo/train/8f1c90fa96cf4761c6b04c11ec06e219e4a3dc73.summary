-- @entity2 @entity1 ban ki - moon is questioning the effectiveness of the manhunt for fugitive warlord @entity5 and his @entity6 , saying @entity8 troops are short on equipment , food and transportation			1
in a 14 - page report to the @entity13 , @entity1 urged member nations to provide the needed resources , warning the troops would be able to carry out their mission			0
" the initiative itself lacks adequate and predictable funding for its operations			0
without the necessary resources , the @entity8 will be unable to execute this important task fully , " @entity1 said in the report released thursday			1

@entity5 is wanted by the @entity36 at the @entity37 for war crimes and crimes against humanity , stemming in part from allegations of his vicious tactics to conscript children as soldiers and sex slaves in his army			1
president @entity48 ordered 100 troops to @entity50 last year to help in the hunt for @entity5			2
the troops are advising regional forces			0
the four countries targeted by @entity5 's army have contributed troops to the manhunt , though @entity1 warned they are woefully short on resources			1

@entity1 said the troops face additional challenges , including the need for the armies and governments of the affected countries to work jointly , both on a political and military level			0
the @entity13 is awaiting a proposal -- by members of the @entity2 , the @entity8 and other countries -- that spells out a strategy to combat @entity5			1
the proposal , according to @entity1 's report , is expected to address how to better protect civilians from the attacks as well as disarm , repatriate and resettle those displaced by @entity5 and his army			2
@entity5 led a failed uprising against the government of @entity31 and was pushed out of the nation six years ago			0
he has been moving around other countries in the region ever since			0

the @entity105 has listed the @entity6 as a terrorist group and in october , @entity104 authorized the @entity108 trainers and military advisers to assist @entity111 forces searching for @entity5 and other leaders of the @entity6			2
the activities of the group are tracked on a website that uses information from the @entity118 's @entity117 , @entity2 agencies and local nongovernmental organizations to map and document recent crimes			0
a celebrity - backed video that went viral this year helped make @entity5 's alleged crimes more widely known			1
