-- a @entity4 petition that would have granted deposed @entity2 president @entity6 safe conduct out of the country was rejected by @entity2 authorities because it did not meet legal standards , @entity2 government minister @entity1 told @entity0 en @entity10			1
@entity6 has been holed up in the @entity12 embassy in the @entity2 capital of @entity14 since september 21			1
in the letter , obtained by @entity0 , @entity4 asks the de facto @entity2 government to guarantee @entity6 's safety from the embassy to the airport , where a @entity21 jet would fly his family to @entity4			1
the @entity4 embassy in @entity2 " has the honor of informing that the government of the @entity4 has decided to receive on its territory " @entity6 , his wife , two children and one of his advisers , the letter states			1
" the embassy petitions the ministry ( of foreign relations ) to provide safe conduct so that the above @entity2 nationals may leave @entity2 territory safely , with respect of their persons and without being detained or otherwise harassed , " the letter states			1
@entity1 said the letter did not meet the necessary standards because it made no mention of under what legal status @entity4 would accept @entity6 and his family			1
the @entity2 foreign ministry said it would consider future petitions from @entity4 or any other countries , as long as they met the accepted legal standards for a request of political asylum			1
the letter submitted by @entity4 makes no mention of granting @entity6 political asylum or any other legal status			1
the omission may not be accidental			0
in an interview with @entity0 en @entity10 , @entity6 said he is still the legitimate president of @entity2 , and as such , would not ask for , or accept political asylum			1
if he leaves @entity2 for another country , it would have to be as a " guest , " @entity6 said			1
@entity6 did not say whether he was negotiating to leave			2
@entity61 , the @entity6 adviser who was named in the letter , said negotiators for @entity6 had spoken with presidents in several @entity66 and @entity67 countries wednesday , including @entity4			2
the goal of the conversations was to " find a way out of the crisis , " @entity61 said			0
in a statement , @entity4 's foreign ministry said its request was made with the support of allies and political actors in @entity2			1
" our country seeks to contribute to rapprochement in @entity2 , taking a positive step towards resolving the crisis in that country through dialogue and negotiation , " the statement said			2
@entity6 was ousted in a june 28 coup			2
after spending months in exile , @entity6 snuck back into @entity2 in september , and has not left the @entity12 embassy			1
his return was an effort to restart talks to negotiate his return as president			0
an agreement was eventually signed , but its implementation has been half - hearted , and @entity6 later called the deal dead			2
the latest setback for the ousted president was a congressional vote , mandated by the agreement , on whether to reinstate @entity6			2
@entity103 voted overwhelmingly against reinstatement			0
the same body had voted to install congressional leader @entity106 as interim president			0
@entity6 's supporters argued that the coup was an illegal act that only restitution could heal			0
@entity103 sought opinions from the nation 's @entity113 and other bodies before holding the vote			0
the court ruled that @entity6 can not return to office without facing trial on charges that he acted unconstitutionally when he tried to hold a vote that could have led to the removal of presidential term limits			0
the @entity113 ruled before the coup that the vote was illegal and @entity103 had forbidden it			0
the coup came on the day the term - limits vote was to have been held			0
@entity106 and his supporters have insisted that @entity6 's removal was a constitutional transfer of power , not a coup			0
but the @entity135 , the @entity131 , the @entity132 and most nations -- including the @entity134 -- condemned the coup and demanded that @entity6 be reinstated immediately .			0
