@entity2 minorities now represent more than half of @entity2 's population under the age of 1 , the @entity0 said , a historic demographic milestone with profound political , economic and social implications			0
the bureau -- defining a minority as anyone who is not " single race white " and " not @entity12 " -- released estimates on thursday showing that 50.4 % of children younger than 1 were minorities as of july 1 , 2011 , up from 49.5 % from the @entity16 taken in april 2010			1
" 2011 is the first time the population of infants under age 1 is majority minority , " said @entity17 , a @entity0 spokesman			1
the latest statistics -- which also count the national population younger than 5 as 49.7 % minority in 2011 , an increase from 49 % in 2010 -- portend a future of a more racially diverse @entity2 , with new and growing populations playing more important roles politically and economically in years to come , analysts say			1
like other analysts , @entity31 , senior demographer at the @entity32 and professor of sociology at the @entity35 , is n't surprised at the trend			0
" we 've known it was going to come , but the question was what year the " crossover point " would happen , he said			0
" little children are in the vanguard of all this change coming to @entity2			0
@entity31 sees the trend as an opportunity for more @entity2 to embrace diversity			0
more children are going to be exposed to a more diverse group of classmates , and that will affect attitudes and outlook			1
the changes are going to be felt first in hospitals , as well as schools , where an increasingly diverse child population has to be absorbed			0
hospitals would need interpreters and translators , for example , @entity31 said			0
@entity63 as a second language would be an educational priority			0
while many regions such as @entity67 have a diverse population , other regions lack racial and ethnic variety and will have to deal with a new kind of population , he said			0
in declining rural counties , he said , an influx of groups like @entity12 would serve to renew communities and changes would ensue			1
" for a country that 's aging , we need young workers , and the growth of the minority population will contribute to the size of the young adult workforce , " he said			1
" this is breathing new life into the @entity2			0
" @entity86 , senior demographer at the @entity87 , called the @entity16 numbers " a cumulative effect of 35 to 40 years of immigration " bringing large numbers of @entity92 , @entity93 and other immigrants into the @entity2			1
he said the @entity12 population in particular is very young , much more concentrated in child - bearing years , and has a higher fertility rate than the white , @entity99 population			1
lately , he says , there are a lot more births among native @entity12 in the @entity2 than new @entity12 immigrants , a " cumulative effect " of immigration			1
if the trend continues , @entity86 says several decades from now , possibly in the late 2030s or early 2040s , the @entity2 population will become less than 50 % non-hispanic white			1
" this is a trend that we can reasonably expect to continue			0
the factors that determine this have been set into motion , and in demography things tend to change gradually , " he said			0
there were 114 million minorities in 2011 , or 36.6 % of the @entity2 population , a bump of half a percentage point from 2010			1
the latest figures count hispanics as the most populous and fastest growing minority group			1
they numbered 52 million in 2011 , and their population grew by 3.1 % since 2010			2
the @entity2 @entity12 population grew from 16.3 % in 2010 to 16.7 % in 2011			1
" @entity126 had the largest @entity12 population of any state on july 1 , 2011 ( 14.4 million ) , as well as the largest numeric increase within the @entity12 population since april 1 , 2010 , ( 346,000 ) , " the @entity16 said			1
" @entity131 had the highest percentage of @entity12 at 46.7 %			1

" @entity149 is our nation 's only majority - @entity146 state , with people of this group comprising 57.1 % of the total population			1
@entity133 had the largest @entity146 population of any county ( 1.6 million ) in 2011 , and also the largest numeric increase ( 16,000 ) since 2010			2
at 61.2 % , @entity159 had the highest percentage of @entity93 in the nation , " the @entity16 said			1
african - americans are the second largest minority group in the @entity2 at 43.9 million in 2011 , an increase of 1.6 % from 2010			1
@entity165 has the largest black population of any state with 3.7 million and @entity140 has the largest increase from 2010 of 84,000			2
@entity169 , @entity170 , which includes @entity171 , has the largest black population of any county at 1.3 million			2
@entity174 , @entity175 , which includes @entity67 , has the largest increase since 2010 at 13,000			2
the @entity177 has the highest percentage of blacks at 52.2 %			1
@entity180 has the second - largest at 38 %			1
@entity2 's native population -- labeled " @entity183 and @entity182 population " by the @entity16 -- was about 6.3 million in 2011 , up 2.1 % from 2010			1
@entity126 had the largest such population at 1,050,000 and the largest increase at 23,000			2

minorities comprised the majority population in 11 % of the nation 's 3,143 counties			0
@entity214 , professor of sociology at @entity216 , said the rise of minorities fits into a longer - term evolution of the @entity2 population , a mosaic that has been adapting to ethnic change since the first @entity16 was recorded in 1790			1
there have been many groups represented over time , from enslaved and indigenous peoples , those of @entity228 stock , and now to a population reflecting the wider world -- truly a " melting pot , " he said			0
@entity214 says it 's hard to say how the changes will affect politics and that one ca n't assume that ethnic patterns will determine voting patterns			0
local economic issues , for example , will evolve differently in different states and cities , and there are economic benefits of having a younger population , he said			0
" the political dimensions will play out differently , " he said			0
and by the time the babies are old enough to cast ballots , " the @entity2 will be a different place when they are walking into a voting booth			0
" @entity250 , @entity251 demographer , sees political challenges for new immigrants and an economy benefiting from their presence			0
many @entity12 and @entity93 are too young to vote or ca n't cast ballots because they have n't become citizens			1
" it 's going to take perhaps awhile before the younger people get more engaged in politics			0
they do have an impact in some places , like swing states , such as @entity264 , @entity265 and @entity266			0
they can make a difference , " he said			0
he , too , says that newcomers to the @entity2 bring an energy that invigorates the economic system and an older society			0
" i think we 're going to just see that the younger part of the population will have a different vibe , " he said			0
" they are sort of needed to help our youthful image and to add to that vitality			0
they will bring a dimension and element we sorely need			0
