-- a total solar eclipse occurred over the northeastern @entity3 coast early in the morning of november 14 local time			1
clueless about this spectacular astronomical event ? no worries , we 've got you covered			0
we 're here to explain what causes this remarkable act of nature , what skygazers see and how those outside of @entity3 can join in the experience			1
what exactly is a total solar eclipse ? a solar eclipse happens when the moon , as it orbits @entity19 , passes directly in front of the sun , obscuring its rays and casting a shadow on @entity19 's surface			1
sometimes referred to as a " happy accident of nature , " a total solar eclipse occurs when the moon is perfectly aligned with both the sun and @entity19 , so it appears from our perspective that the sun is completely blocked			1
when is this happening and who can see it ? the total solar eclipse became visible in the far north of @entity3 about an hour after sunrise local time on november 14 ( afternoon of november 13 in the @entity35 and evening of november 13 in @entity36 )			1
a total eclipse of the sun can only be seen from within what 's known as the path of totality , a narrow path the moon 's inner shadow travels as it glides across the @entity19			1
the most populated areas within that path are in the @entity47 and @entity48 region			1
it estimated to take about three hours for the moon 's shadow to travel the entire path of totality			2
what time total darkness occurred , and how long it lasted , depended on location			2
@entity56 was expected to begin in @entity47 at 0638 local time and was to last nearly two minutes			2
by contrast , totality was estimated to only last just about 20 seconds in the small town of @entity61			0
what 's all the fuss about ? do n't these happen frequently ? according to @entity65 , a full solar eclipse happens , on average , every 18 months			1
the last one happened in july 2010 , crossing @entity68 's @entity67 , and one will occur over equatorial @entity69 in november 2014			2
but for any given region , a total solar eclipse only happens , on average , once every 375 years			1
solar eclipses were shrouded in superstition in ancient times -- in @entity75 , for example , viewing total solar eclipses was important for divining the future success of an emperor			1
however , as scientific knowledge deepened , these events became opportunities for conducting important experiments			0
it was during a total solar eclipse in 1919 that @entity87 's theory of general relativity was tested and confirmed for the first time			1
quiz : can you see the light ? what 's it like to experience a solar eclipse and what do you see ? a solar eclipse is often described as one of nature 's most awe - inspiring events			1
some people are so moved by the experience of watching an eclipse that they travel around the world chasing them			2
about an hour leading up to totality , all sorts of things begin to happen			0
there are changes in the color of the sky , the temperature drops , birds and animals behave in a peculiar manner and shadows sharpen , according to @entity119 , an eclipse chaser from @entity121 who is viewing his 14th total solar eclipse			1
" i never really expected to be moved the way i was			0
it 's a phenomenal thing to see , " he said , recalling his first experience			2
as the moon 's shadow sweeps across the @entity19 , the sun turns into a crescent in the sky			2
just before totality , so - called @entity136 's beads â € ” bright spots of sunlight shining through the moon 's craggy surface â € ” can appear around the moon			0
then the moon completely blots out the sun , leaving only a halo of light visible			0
after the brief period of darkness , @entity136 's beads might appear again as the sun comes back into view			0
where can i see this eclipse ? you can watch the video here on @entity0			0
on @entity157 , there was a tweet - up devoted to the event and you can always get first - hand accounts of the event on @entity163 , where we asked people to share their solar eclipse photos and experiences			1
do i need special glasses to watch a solar eclipse ? yes ! permanent eye damage can occur if you look directly at the sun. that means when viewing any partial phase of a total eclipse , you need to wear proper solar eclipse glasses			1
regular sunglasses wo n't offer enough protection , and forget about using telescopes or binoculars unless you 've attached special filters to them			0
only during totality can you remove filters and glasses			0
if you 're feeling crafty , you can create your own pinhole projector			0
any tips for first - time viewers ? if you 're keen to capture some good photos , you need to be prepared			0
@entity188 , a website devoted to solar eclipses , has several pointers for photographers			0
among them : -- leave your flash attachment at home -- do n't forget to remove your filter during totality -- use a telescope or telephoto lens with a focal length of 400 millimetres or more -- opt for manually focusing over auto focus -- keep your setup as portable , light and easy to assemble as possible in case you need to relocate in a hurry to escape clouds			0
veteran eclipse watchers all had the same advice for first - timers : do n't waste time fiddling with cameras and telescopes that you miss soaking up that fleeting moment of complete darkness .			0
