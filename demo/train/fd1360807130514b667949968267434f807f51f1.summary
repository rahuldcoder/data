-- an unmanned moon lander under development crashed and blew up during an engine test thursday afternoon at @entity6 's @entity5 , the space agency reported			1
there were no injuries in the failed test of the lander , dubbed " @entity11			1
" the craft had gone through several previous exercises in which it was hung from a crane , but thursday was to have been its first free flight			0
instead , the prototype rose a short distance , rolled over and slammed into the ground			0
the craft caught fire immediately and exploded about 30 seconds later			0
" the vehicle itself is lost , " @entity22 , the @entity11 project manager , told reporters			1
" but we are working currently on gathering more data and information to understand what occurred in the test and how we can learn from it and move forward			2
" read more about space and science on @entity0 's @entity34 blog @entity22 said operators have recovered memory devices from the wreckage and will be pulling the data off of them for clues to the cause of the accident			1
" from early indications , it seems to be within our guidance navigation control system , seems to point toward hardware , " @entity22 said			0
in a written statement , @entity6 said failure is " part of the development process for any complex spaceflight hardware , " and designers will learn from whatever caused thursday 's crash			1
the @entity11 lander is designed to carry up to 1,100 pounds of cargo for a future moon mission			1
its engines are fueled partly by methane , which the agency says is easier to handle and store than other propellants such as liquid hydrogen or hydrazine			0
@entity22 said the space agency has spent about $ 7 million on the project over two and a half years , and the test lander lost thursday was " in the $ 500,000 class			2
" another one is currently under construction at the @entity71 in @entity72 and may be complete in two to three months			0
" we want to make sure that what we learn today gets applied to that next vehicle , " he said			2
