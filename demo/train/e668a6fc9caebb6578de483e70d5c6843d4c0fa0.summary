takes your face in his cool , confident hands and gives you the kind of kiss that makes the world fall away just as the clock strikes 12			1
friends are giddy , caviar is glistening , the old year is ending , and the new year is whatever i say it is			1
here is the reality : @entity7 put on a housecoat the minute the director yelled " cut , " caviar makes my ankles swell , and @entity49 has never once lived up to its billing			1
i spent 18 years in a tiny studio apartment just a few short blocks from @entity53 , and i 'm here to tell you i saw things -- ugly , hard - partying , throw - uppy things -- that never made it onto any @entity58 special			1
i mean , i like a disco ball and confetti as much as the next girl , but there 's something about forced frivolity that feels so , well ... forced			1
then , a few years ago , i took a radical step : i quit			1
you heard me : i dropped out of @entity49			1
i mailed my formal letter of resignation to @entity69 , explaining that the urge to go out and get crazy has been replaced by the urge to stay in and get sane ( or a reasonable facsimile thereof )			1
i said , " so long , sucker , " and i never looked back			2
here 's the routine i employed in the early days of my gala - free existence			2
i 'd slip into something a little more comfortable ( we 're talking @entity79 jersey and tube socks )			2
i 'd cook a lovely meal and eat it at a table set so perfectly it would make @entity84 weep			2
i 'd rent anything with @entity86 -- " @entity88 , @entity89 " ( hey , if @entity87 happens to show up , so much the better ) -- and then -- drumroll , please -- i 'd pick my worst set of drawers , my messiest closet , my highest mountain of old papers , and start chipping away at the chaos that had given me grief all year long			2
i was ruthless in my pursuit of clarity : dog - eared @entity99 catalog from last spring , gone ! @entity102 article i meant to copy for everyone i 'd ever met , out ! the @entity108 with that incredible @entity110 cover , bye - bye , baby -- it was great fun , but it was just one of those things			2
my friends would wake up with hangovers while i would wake up with a clean closet and at least half a dozen bags of stuff for @entity119			0
i felt calm , i felt virtuous , i felt really , really out of it			0
then one fine day , @entity132 , that boyfriend i mentioned a few paragraphs back , became the father of my daughter , and suddenly the lovely meal i 'd always prepare was replaced by a hot dog for @entity139 , fish sticks for @entity123 ( boyfriend 's son who does n't eat meat ) , and finally , at that inevitable moment when @entity122 gets cranky and begins pelting @entity123 with his own fish sticks and @entity123 ca n't be in the vicinity of a nonvegetarian hot dog without making obnoxious gagging sounds , i 'd go to plan b : macaroni and cheese for all			0
the @entity86 movie gave way to a @entity147 video , and the messes that used to drive me nuts stopped getting to me in quite the same way			0
i finally figured out that life is inherently messy and it takes a lot more than a @entity49 purge to bring it under control			1
so now , whenever december 31 rolls around , i abdicate control			0
i invite two or three close friends to stop by if they 're so inclined ; and if they 're not , @entity132 and i like to devote at least a couple of hours to horrifying the children with our general dorkiness			1
last year , just before midnight , we got ourselves and the kids all bundled up and headed to the roof to watch fireworks light up the @entity166			0
we were pleasantly surprised to discover that unlike the @entity167 , we had the roof all to ourselves			0
it was around 12:03 when one of us remembered that there are no fireworks over the @entity166 on @entity49			1
i guess sometimes you just do n't get fireworks			0
but every once in a while , you get something even better : we stood there , huddled together at the top of the world in our flannel pajamas , down jackets , mittens , and scarves , our breath coming out in soft puffs that mingled and hung in the night , laughing like idiots -- thinking that for better or for worse , these are the good old days			1
so good , in fact , we may do the exact same thing again this year			0
