-- it 's been in continuous production since the 1950s but @entity4 @entity3 -- the last country where the vehicles were still being made -- ceases production of the classic @entity7 today , the last day of 2013			1
@entity9 off the production lines in @entity11 , @entity12 , until 1979 but continuing in @entity3 , the @entity13 , aka the camper van , is the longest - produced model in automotive history , according to @entity16			1
around 3.5 million of the affordable , utilitarian vehicles , with their classic cloth window curtains , have been made			1
attaching themselves to the mini-homes on wheels were equally numerous roof racks , surfboards and travel memories			2
on a backpacking trip to @entity27 back in 1973 , a 20 - year - old @entity25 named @entity28 shelled out us $ 700 to set himself up for the months of travel ahead			2
he spent a chunk of that money on a 1967 @entity4 minibus , wanting to combine transportation and accommodation in one slightly rickety but reliable vehicle			1
he ripped out the seats , put in a platform bed and installed shelves and cupboards			2
@entity28 spent the next 10 months in this mobile home with his wife battling desert sands in @entity43 , food poisoning in @entity45 and enduring six - week stints with no contact with friends or family			2
similar stories are told by countless other travelers			2
@entity13 is calling it quits because the @entity7 wo n't meet new safety standards set to come into force next year in @entity3			1
upgrading the van with dual front airbags and anti-lock brakes was ruled too costly			1
come next year , old @entity57 sluggishly powering their way along highways and up mountain passes , being overtaken by virtually all other traffic , will be all that remain -- ageing steel bodies from a time when people were less concerned about getting somewhere fast			2
it 's worth pausing to reflect on what made the @entity7 a travel icon			1
hippies and surfers the @entity7 became synonymous in the 1960s and 1970s with hippies and surfers , its utilitarian features -- capable of carrying surf boards , musical equipment and various loads inside or on its roof -- combining well with its cheap price ( secondhand @entity57 could be picked up for a couple hundred bucks ) and easy maintenance			1
@entity28 's van required the repair of one flat tire and a new battery in 10 months of travel			1
many people named their @entity90 , like @entity91 , 40 , who affectionately called his @entity92 " " i have no desire to own anything except an old @entity13 , " @entity91 insists			1
other ireporters named their vans " @entity97 , " " @entity98 , " " @entity99 " and " @entity100			0
" @entity101 , 32 , explains , " cars like the @entity13 van are more than just cars , they 're cultural icons			1
" those who traveled in one in their youth keep the memories with them			0
others own their van ( or vans ) for decades before passing them to offspring			1
even people without " @entity13 lineage , " as @entity117 @entity116 calls it , can find themselves bitten by the urge to up and travel in a @entity7			0
second life online online communities provide space to share stories and trade " ideas that help keep our vans going , " says @entity101			1
@entity128 's @entity127 is an online forum co-founded and sponsored by @entity130 , a parts distributor			0
" @entity139 " from @entity130 says the business supplies @entity133 enthusiasts in @entity128 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 and other countries			0
" once you 've driven a @entity7 , you 're hooked for life , " he says			1
but why ? after all , these @entity13 vans , at least in their original form , are underpowered , slow , have dodgy suspension and do n't offer much comfort in either heat or cold			0
" @entity133 exemplifies the free spirit of peace activists , lovers , world travelers , campers and families moving about together across this planet , " says @entity28			0
" few vehicles scream : ' @entity156 ! ' the way a @entity13 van does , " says @entity101			1
modern modification simplicity has helped the @entity7 remain relevant in a new century			0
it 's undergone plenty of modifications , but its outward appearance remains instantly recognizable			0
the model produced in @entity3 was based on the second phase of the @entity7 ( @entity13 's @entity167 was the @entity168 ) , which was produced in @entity12 from 1967 -- 1979			1
it differed from the first phase with a larger engine , greater weight and a bay window , rather than the previous model 's split - windscreen			0
numerous iterations have brought speed and body width increases , automatic transmission and an engine switch from air - to water - cooled			0
it 's not a complicated machine -- handy when something goes wrong			0
kombi owner @entity116 says part of the @entity13 's appeal to him was , " we 'd always heard [ they ] could be fixed anywhere and by anyone			1
" @entity91 says the @entity133 's enduring appeal comes down to versatility : " you can travel in it , sleep in it , it gets decent fuel mileage and it 's very compact compared to large motor homes			0
" @entity101 applauds the @entity7 as a jack of all trades , saying he 's used his " as a camper , a mountain bike hauler , a moving van and a construction supply truck			2
" @entity12 effectiveness the versatility of a kombi goes right back to its name , which comes from the @entity12 " @entity208 , " a combination of passenger and cargo vehicle			1
its ability to carry both passengers and piles of stuff has made the @entity7 more than a mode of transport			2
" the bus is both our home and a member of our family , " says @entity116			0
" we talk to it as we decide a path for each day , coax it slowly over the next hill and thank it as we arrive at each new destination			0
" the vehicle is also a great conversation starter			2
" vws are [ like ] a language understood throughout the world , " says @entity91			0
" people in each country we visit love the bus -- they stop to tell us their stories and ask to hear ours , " says @entity116			0
not the end of the road devotion to the @entity133 helps loyalists remain upbeat about the end of production			2
" as long as enthusiastic owners keep the remaining cars and their spirit alive , the end of active production wo n't mean the end of the vehicle , " says @entity101			1
when @entity28 completed his 1973 tour in the bus that had served him so reliably , he sold it for a $ 100 profit			0
then he " watched it drive away to offer its new owner 's fond memories			0
" even though the factory gates have shut , well - preserved @entity57 will keep rumbling along the road and in the recollections of 63 years of travelers			1
