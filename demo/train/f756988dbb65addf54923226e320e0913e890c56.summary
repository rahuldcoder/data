to even cooking pot ( the @entity8 oven )			0
now it 's added an official state firearm -- the @entity13 - designed m1911 pistol , becoming the first state in the nation to have one , according to the state legislator who sponsored the law			1
@entity1 gov. @entity18 signed the new symbol into law this week			0
state rep. @entity21 , a @entity22 who was a police officer and @entity24 team commander , came up with the idea for a state firearm last year after hearing about how @entity28 lawmakers wanted to make the @entity28 long rifle its official state firearm , @entity21 told @entity0 on friday			1
that measure eventually failed , he said			0
@entity21 selected the semi-automatic @entity33 because gun maker @entity13 was born and raised in @entity35 , @entity1 , and was the son of @entity1 pioneers who crossed the plains in the 1800s , @entity21 said			1
this year is also the 100th anniversary of when the @entity42 military chose the @entity33 to be its standard - issue sidearm for all branches of service , @entity21 said			1
that 's how the pistol got its name : " m " for military and 1911 for the year that the military began issuing the gun to all its servicemen and women , @entity21 said			1
in a state more known for its strong @entity57 traditions and breathtaking national parks , the creation of an official state firearm raised controversy , especially when the measure was pursued even after january 's mass shooting in @entity62 , @entity63 , that killed six persons and wounded 13 others , including @entity42 rep. @entity66			1
the bill was introduced just before the horrific shootings , @entity21 said			0
" people say the timing is terrible , and i admit the timing is terrible , " @entity21 said			0
" we have a part - time legislature in @entity1 , and we are only in session for 45 days			2
certainly meaning no disrespect to the tragedy in @entity63 , we moved forward in doing this because it 's the only opportunity that we had			0
" other critics have said the new state symbol implicitly condones gun violence			0
" there was more controversy than i anticipated , but it really passed with bipartisan support , " @entity21 said			2
" one of the biggest comments from the critics was that we should not honor an implement of death			0
and my response to that has always been that this firearm does not represent an implement of death			0
it represents an implement of freedom -- just the mere fact that our soldiers have used this firearm to defend liberty and freedom around the world for the last 100 years			0
" the governor 's office played down the lethality of the new symbol and focused more on its creator			0
" this bill is n't so much about a weapon as it is about honoring @entity13 , who was a @entity1 inventor and entrepreneur , and he repeatedly gave back to the state , " said the governor 's spokeswoman , @entity103			1
the governor 's office and both chambers of the legislature are controlled by @entity22			0
the @entity33 had been the standard issue in the military until about 15 years ago , when the @entity116 9mm became its common sidearm because it holds 15 rounds and the @entity33 only eight , @entity21 said			2
however , the @entity33 is still used by elite units like @entity120 , @entity21 said			2
" i thought how appropriate that we honor @entity13 on the 100th anniversary of the @entity42 military 's adoption of the @entity33 as their official pistol , " @entity21 said			1
" the list of firearms that he invented is too exhaustive for me to go into , " @entity21 added about @entity13			2
@entity21 owns a @entity13 - designed @entity33 , he said			1
" almost every military weapon that is currently in use today has one point or another been modeled after a @entity13 firearm , " @entity21 said			1
@entity21 , 35 , is now considering running for @entity1 's fourth congressional seat , newly created after the latest census , he said			1
he was a @entity24 commander , canine patrol officer and sex crimes detective in @entity137 , @entity1 , for seven years and then a patrol officer in @entity139 , @entity1 , for four years , he said			0
he left the police force to serve in the state legislature and is now a partner in the security consulting firm @entity143 in @entity144 , @entity1 , where he lives			2
addressing other critics who say he 's merely seeking publicity for his possible congressional run , @entity21 responded : " people will second - guess everything i do and say everything i do is because of the congressional race , and it 's simply not true			1

@entity1 's official state firearm is the @entity13 - designed @entity33 pistol
the designation of a lethal weapon has created controversy
the legislation 's sponsor says the semi-automatic gun was a military standard for decades
state rep. @entity21 *denies* he 's seeking publicity for a congressional run
