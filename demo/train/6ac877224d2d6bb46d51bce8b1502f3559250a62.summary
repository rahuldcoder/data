-- in the end , it was security camera video that made the difference			0
@entity5 , an @entity6 mother of three children and four stepchildren who spent nine days detained in @entity9 under suspicion of smuggling marijuana , was released from a @entity12 , @entity9 , prison friday , mainly because of that video			1
the judge 's ruling , obtained exclusively by @entity0 , shows the surveillance video from a bus terminal and the testimony of three witnesses , were more than sufficient to convince @entity21 del @entity20 , a @entity9 federal judge in the border city of @entity12 , @entity9 ; to give @entity23 her freedom back			1
the prosecution 's case , the 29 - page document shows , was merely circumstantial			1
in other words , @entity23 was arrested simply because one of two packages of marijuana discovered on the bus was found under her seat			1
in the ruling , @entity20 calls the prosecution 's case " not apt or sufficient to corroborate that @entity5 ... is the person who transported the narcotics			1
" @entity23 , 42 , and her husband @entity38 , 41 , were traveling together after attending her aunt 's funeral in the @entity9 state of @entity42 , according to the ruling and to interviews conducted with the couple by @entity0			1
they boarded a bus belonging to the @entity49 bus company in the city of @entity51 on their way back home to the town of @entity55 , outside @entity56			0
their bus was stopped at a military checkpoint may 22 in the town of @entity62 , in the state of @entity64 , where three soldiers found two packages containing marijuana , the document says			2
the drugs , wrapped in clear plastic with " cinnamon - colored " tape , weighed 6.003 kilos ( 13.23 pounds ) , according to evidence presented in court and referenced in the judge 's ruling			2
it had been originally reported by @entity9 authorities the two packages had a combined weight of 5.7 kilograms			0
both @entity5 and @entity23 were initially detained			2
@entity23 was later released because neither of the two packages of marijuana was found under his seat			2
one was found under his wife 's seat , number 39			2
the other was under seat 42 , which was unoccupied			0
the bus driver , identified by the court document as @entity90 , also was detained			0
he , too , was released from prison last friday , just hours before @entity23			0
according to the judge 's ruling , three witnesses -- the bus driver and two fellow passengers -- testified that the @entity97 boarded the bus in @entity51 carrying only two blankets and her personal purse			1
the surveillance video , shown to the court last thursday at a hearing to which @entity0 had access , shows , in addition to the blankets and the purse , @entity5 was carrying two bottles of water and nothing more			1
in issuing the ruling , @entity20 said the fact that " the narcotics in question were found under seat number 39 of bus 323 of the @entity121 which was occupied by the defendant does not lead us to conclude in an indisputable way that the drugs were in possession of @entity5			1
" the judge also sided with defense attorney @entity124 in saying that it would have been impossible for the @entity126 to somehow hide such an amount of drugs while boarding			0
" it is illogical and also not credible to believe the packages could 've been placed ( by the @entity97 ) where they were found , " the judge said , " without any other passenger on the bus noticing it			2
" speaking to @entity0 last wednesday , in her first interview from inside the prison , recorded two days before her release , @entity23 had raised the same objections the judge mentions in her ruling			1
" they have cameras in the terminals , on the bus			0
and they have n't checked that , " @entity23 told @entity0			0
" why do n't they check for fingerprints ? i do n't have my fingerprints on the package			0
" a top official in the @entity9 state of @entity64 said that , so far as the @entity9 government is concerned , " the case is closed			0
" the official , speaking on condition of anonymity because he 's not authorized to speak publicly about the case , said nobody else is expected to be prosecuted			1
the soldiers who detained the @entity97 " were only doing their job , " the official said .			0

surveillance video from a bus terminal and the testimony of three witnesses carried the day
the prosecution 's case was " not apt or sufficient " proof , the judge says
@entity5 was arrested because a package of marijuana was under her bus seat
nobody else is expected to be prosecuted , an official tells @entity0
