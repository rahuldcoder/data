-- much has changed for @entity3 student body president @entity1 since he made news in november for admitting to being an undocumented immigrant			1
for one , he says he 's been threatened countless times			1
" my cell phone info was public since i 'm the ( student body ) president and so that was leaked out and people were calling me at night leaving me very -- let 's say passionate voice mails , " he said			1
the worst was the voice mail of gunshots and someone laughing in the background , he said			2
he received phone calls from as far away as @entity18 from someone who said they were coming to @entity20 to make a " citizen 's arrest " because he was " illegal			2
" they never showed up , he said			2
@entity1 moved with his parents from @entity24 when he was 3			1
he has little memory of living anywhere other than @entity26 , @entity20 , located about 45 miles outside @entity27			2
" i wanted to go to the military , but then i started asking questions and found out i was n't a citizen			2
and then i found out i was undocumented , " @entity1 told @entity0 in november			1
" i knew i was born in @entity24 , but i was under the impression that we fixed our legal residency			2
so when i found out that was n't the case , i was a little taken away			2
" for four years , @entity1 did not reveal his undocumented status			1
when he started college at @entity27 , he told a few friends about his illegal status and hoped they would keep his secret			2
that all changed in november after an anonymous tip to the @entity3 newspaper , @entity43 , leaked his undocumented status			1
reaction to the news was mixed			1
while a small , but vocal group came out against @entity1 , @entity3 president @entity46 emerged as one of @entity1 's most high - profile supporters			1
" i commend ( him ) and other @entity52 students who are following the statute as they seek higher education despite a great many difficulties that undocumented immigrants face , " @entity46 said in a statement to @entity0			1
@entity52 is a @entity20 state law that allows qualified undocumented students to pay in - state tuition , instead of out - of - state tuition , at @entity20 's public higher education institutions			1
" when ( his ) immigration status was made public ... there was some campus controversy and it occurred at the same time when the @entity66 voted to endorse the @entity67 , " @entity46 said			1
" my support of their efforts stems from a hope that our campus and community will remember that diverse colleges and universities better prepare students for the diverse workplace of today and tomorrow			2
" @entity46 was referring to legislation that calls for offering a path to citizenship for some illegal immigrants who entered the @entity83 as children			2
in december , the @entity67 was defeated by a @entity86 filibuster in the @entity87 after winning passage in the @entity89			0
despite his support for @entity1 , @entity46 said the controversy and conflict surrounding the student is understandable			1
still , he lauds @entity94 for " encouraging students to strive to change laws in our nation that may be unjust			0
" fellow @entity3 senior @entity99 -- who describes himself an @entity101 - @entity83 citizen born to legal immigrant parents from @entity101 -- became @entity1 's most vocal critic			1
" there is a process to become a citizen			0
my parents emigrated here from @entity111			0
they took the path @entity113 should have taken			0
that 's the process in place and that 's the process he should have applied to			0
he should n't be a special case			0
he should n't be granted special treatment , " @entity99 said in a phone interview with @entity0			0
@entity99 created a website called @entity123 , which he uses to " expose " @entity1 , he says on his website			1
" i agree with diversity			0
this is nothing against diversity , " @entity99 told @entity0			0
" this is not about race or anti-diversity			0
everybody knows this country was built by immigrants			0
but we are a nation of laws			0
the reason this country is so great is because we have laws			0
" in recent months , other college students have come forward as undocumented immigrants			1
this month , @entity83 immigration officials decided that an undocumented immigrant in @entity141 apprehended by authorities after driving without a license can stay in the @entity83 for another year			1
reached by phone as she rushed to class last week , @entity145 student @entity144 told @entity0 the decision was " like a big present			1
" @entity150 , 23 , a @entity151 student in @entity152 , @entity153 , is also undocumented			1
much like @entity1 , the @entity24 college student has lived in the @entity83 since his family entered the country illegally when he was a toddler			1
in late april , @entity153 's governor and two @entity83 senators announced they had won the fight against @entity150 's deportation and that he would be allowed to stay in the @entity83 , for now , and graduate this month with his classmates			0
" i think that 's great , " @entity1 said @entity163 's case			1
" i believe that he 's a student like me			2
it shows that people support us			0
just like the polls show , ( the @entity83 would ) rather have students who want to stay in the country			0
they want to find a path for them rather then deport them			0
" for @entity1 , his dream is still very much alive			1
he 's looking into continuing his education to get a master 's in public administration and policy			0
to those who criticize his still illegal status , he said , " until @entity184 decides to act , there 's no process " to become a citizen			0
he understands he is a divisive character , but said he 's received more support than attacks in the six months since his immigration status was released			0
he is scheduled to graduate on may 21 .			0
