how many @entity1 does it take to impress a hotel valet in @entity3 ? more than 25 , apparently			2
the guy driving us around the opulent @entity6 in his hotel - issued golf cart was non-plussed by the abundant wealth on display in the driveways and parking lots around the property			1
how many ferraris were here ? " twenty to twenty - five , " he said , shrugging			2
how many bmws ? " too many to count			2
" this is @entity18 , of course , where money ai n't a thing			2
but there was even more money here this week : the resort was playing host to the the @entity27 's annual meeting , always a magnet for major @entity30 donors , corporate fixers and political consultants looking to get some some face time , and maybe a contract or two , with the 31 @entity27 governors and governors - elect who now control state houses around the country			1
" it 's a target - rich environment , " said @entity40 gov. @entity39			2
" governors are able to talk to businesses from around the country that are looking to re-locate and looking to expand ... i 've gotten a few scalps here			1
" @entity39 joined a half dozen other potential 2016 presidential candidates , including @entity48 , @entity39 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			1
they were all more than happy to soak up attention from admirers and make nice with potential contributors			1
" if you are an individual who is running for office , this is a good place to be to meet people who have a lot really good ideas about how to to do public policy , and meet men and women who want to see good government put into place , " @entity39 said			2
" and it 's up to the point of , ' well , i 'm gon na loan you not only my name , but lend you some money as well			2
i 'm gon na contribute to your campaign			2
' and that 's all good			0
that 's how this process works			0
" all of this means that money is in the air at events like the one in @entity3 , which are as much about donor maintenance and business meetings as they are about electing governors			1
when their donors are involved , the @entity27 likes to roll out the red carpet , holding their conferences at high - end resorts like this one : past @entity27 meetings were held in @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92			1
@entity27 governors and their entourages were everywhere at the resort — in hallways , quiet corners , busy coffee shops and fancy dinners — making time for admirers and at least feigning interest in pitch - men from companies like @entity105 and @entity106 who stalked the corridors			1
aides stood at the ready to take their business cards			0
meetings were taken , drinks were drunk , and golf was played			0
at the hotel bar on thursday , one foursome of @entity27 golfers proudly showed off a picture on their iphones : they had been golfing nearby at @entity120 , founded by @entity121 , and a cigar - chomping @entity122 played through			1
they snapped a pic of him putting			0
the event attracted the usual pack of political press — including the " @entity130 " crew — eager to flee the freezing temperatures of @entity132 and meet sources , interview new governors and get an early bead on the @entity27 presidential race , which does n't seem like it will start as soon as reporters would like it to			1
they also had to suffer through a barrage of cliches about governors knowing how to lead			1
did you know that states are the laboratories of democracy ? you do now			0
@entity48 , the outgoing @entity27 chairman , passed the committee leadership baton to @entity149 gov. @entity148 on thursday , but not before basking in the glow of a successful election cycle			1
swarmed by reporters every time he showed his face , @entity48 swatted away questions about his presidential thinking and insisted that he just wanted to reflect on a winning cycle and celebrate with his fellow @entity30			1
" @entity48 did a fantastic job , " said @entity160 , the newly - elected @entity27 governor of blue @entity161 and maybe the biggest surprise winner of 2014			1
" the candidates and the donors and everybody here are thrilled			2
you could n't do a better job , winning multiple blue states like @entity171 and @entity172 and @entity161			0
it 's a pretty big win for @entity48 and the @entity27			1
" @entity160 was like the star rookie at an @entity176 training camp , the subject of gentle ribbing from his more seasoned colleagues but also the buzziest newcomer in @entity3			0
" people said to me during the campaign that i seem like @entity48 with a softer edge , " he said			0
" we are both pretty blunt			0
they liked the fact that our personalities are similar			0
" few people thought @entity160 could win when he announced his campaign — including @entity48			0
" we were on the @entity190 list for the @entity27 , " he said			1
after @entity48 became convinced that @entity160 could pull off a sleeper upset , he asked his fellow @entity27 leaders to make an investment in @entity161 , even going into debt to do so			1
other @entity27 governors were skeptical			1
" they were like , @entity48 have you been drinking ? , " @entity160 chuckled			0
now the governor - elect , @entity160 indulged every major donor who wanted a handshake — and every every reporter who wanted an interview			0
perhaps he was too unguarded			0
he let slip a fact that no @entity204 should ever reveal : he 's never watched " @entity205			0
" maybe i 'll watch them all when i retire , " he said			0
and maybe he 'll retire in @entity3 .			0
