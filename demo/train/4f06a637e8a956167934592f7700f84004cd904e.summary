-- the final two teams left standing at @entity3 should come as no surprise , and nor should another painful exit for perennial underachievers @entity6			1
a heart - breaking defeat on penalties in their quarterfinal was preceded by 120 minutes which saw the style of finalists @entity14 overwhelm @entity16 pragmatism and conquer their heart - on - sleeve spirit			0
so why does @entity6 continue to employ this bulldog style ? and why ca n't the country who gave birth to the game reinvent itself like the all - conquering @entity24 team , who will be gunning for a third consecutive major title against @entity27 in @entity28 on sunday , or the dynamic @entity29 , young pretenders who fell at the semifinal stage ? the answer , according to two respected authors , is history , and how the nation 's deep - rooted view of masculinity has molded its soccer style			1
until that changes , this relentless cycle of disappointment will continue			0
@entity43 , who wrote " @entity44 , " a study of how @entity47 culture and psyche contributed to the influence their football visionaries have had on the game , argues @entity6 's approach to football has not changed for over half a century			1
" the @entity16 were very true to their strengths and weaknesses at @entity3 , " winner told @entity0			1
" they 've been losing in that way for 60 years			0
" every time it comes as surprise when @entity16 heart , commitment and valor and all these old @entity66 values come unstuck against much more skilful opponents			0
" @entity27 reach semifinals after penalty kicks drama the breeding ground for this @entity16 style of football has its roots in the boisterous games of the medieval period , @entity77 argues , and the intrinsic love for " testosterone festivals " like rugby , which was invented around the same time as soccer			0
for him , the attritional modus operandi showcased by @entity6 during sunday 's morale - sapping defeat to a far more fluent @entity27 side shows the national game is still weighed down by this regressive approach			1
" the game is profoundly rooted in old @entity16 stuff and we never lost that , " he adds			0
" we love the battlers like ( former @entity6 players ) @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97			1
" " the idea the game is all about skill and you express your manliness not by fighting but by your skill in being able to do very delicate things -- that affronts something deep in the @entity16 male psyche and i do n't see any change to it			0
" winner 's view is shared by @entity112 , journalist and co-author of " @entity114 , " a book about football 's truths , who subscribes to the view that @entity6 's methodology was spawned from a notion that the soldier was society 's greatest role model			1
this then infiltrated the nation 's best - loved game , reinforcing the idea of a " warrior " culture , when grit and determination were valued over technical skill			0
the stats from @entity3 back this theory up , with @entity6 blocking more shots on goal and putting in more tackles than any other nation upon their exit			1
" in northern @entity141 , in general , we tend to value discipline and sticking to your task highly , " said @entity112			0
" the collective discipline is important and @entity6 and @entity147 are examples of that			1
we live in countries where that is valued			0
you do n't lose yourself in personal creativity , you do your job			0
" the model for the @entity157 man is the soldier , maybe even still is			0
the tabloids talk about our players as soldiers , so the values that are very highly praised in @entity16 football are bravery , passion , obedience , hard work and you do n't tend to hear that much talk about creativity and inspiration , which are not soldierly virtues			2
" but it is n't all gloom and doom for @entity6			1
@entity176 can be extracted from two titans of @entity141 , @entity24 and @entity147 , both of whom radically revamped their approach to the game in the last 15 years			1
for decades , @entity24 were one of soccer 's greatest underachievers , entrenched in a style that emerged from what @entity185 termed " @entity187 ± ola , " or the @entity189 fury			1
like @entity6 , @entity24 's values were immersed in hard work and fight			1
time and time again @entity24 promised much but failed to deliver on the biggest stage			1
it was not until after the turn of the century their traditional tactics were abandoned , and a new style executed by a generation of emerging players started to yield unprecedented results			2
winner insists the revolution was brought about by @entity189 giants @entity203 , and their modern interpretation on the @entity206 teams of the 1970s , led by @entity207 , who were said to play " total football			1
" during his stint as manager of @entity203 , @entity207 's doctrine permeated the club , and he played a key role in the establishment of its " @entity221 " youth academy that has produced so many gifted players that now make up the backbone for the national team			1
" look at how the @entity189 used to play and the way they play now , " winner explains			2
" there 's almost no point of contact between the two styles			0
" reinventing the wheel : how @entity230 revolutionized football @entity147 have also undergone a relatively recent transformation , shedding their traditional , battling , hardworking approach after poor returns at the @entity236 in @entity237 and the @entity238 two years later			1
their past triumphs in both competitions -- @entity147 can boast three titles in each tournament -- were conducted in a manner far removed from the way the current side operate , with skilful and exciting players like @entity248 and @entity249 at their forefront			1
@entity29 football expert @entity251 told @entity0 an insistence on better technical development for young players , instigated in the late 1990s and early 2000s as a result of an under - performing national side , are now starting to pay dividends			1
" those changes are apparent now -- this is the first generation to benefit , " he said			0
" if you have those technical players at your disposal then that will affect they way you play			2
" there was a realization that the @entity267 's power and success saw an increase in foreigners and that young @entity29 players were n't coming through			2
one of the reasons they identified was the coaching was n't up to scratch anymore			0
" they invested lots of money into coaching and youth development and they produced better players			2
as a result better all - round players were being produced			2
they gave someone like coach @entity285 many more options			0
" @entity147 knock @entity286 out of @entity287 @entity6 's quarterfinal defeat has prompted a familiar round of introspection as journalists , pundits , players and managers put forward their blueprint for a bright new future			1
yet the national team 's malaise is at odds with the global success enjoyed by its domestic competition			2
the @entity302 is regularly described as the best , most exciting league in the world , borne out by the record amounts of money broadcasters pay to televise it			0
the next slab of tv rights in the @entity157 was recently sold for Â £ 3 billion			0
but would the @entity302 punters welcome a move away from traditional values , which often provide open and frenetic matches , if it meant @entity6 were able to re-establish themselves as an international force ? " people would like @entity6 to be a winning team but they are n't willing to go through the changes to make it possible , " winner added			1
" if @entity16 clubs team were good enough to play the way @entity24 do -- get a one goal lead and close it out by keeping the ball -- no club crowd would tolerate that for more than 20 minutes			1
they 'd scream ' get it upfield			0
' " we 'd find that boring and the crowds would stay away , and they 'd also find it unmanly			0
" there are changes afoot though			0
the @entity333 told @entity0 its new @entity334 , which will act as a development hub for young players and coaches , is due to be handed over next week			2
prior to @entity6 's humiliating 4 - 1 defeat to @entity147 in the second round of the @entity340 , the @entity333 embarked on a process to develop a new philosophy for how the national game should be played , and it has subsequently made changes to the way youngsters are coached			1
@entity347 , a development officer at the coalface of grassroots football in @entity350 , says coaching methods and the attitude of parents who would perpetuate the " win at all costs mentality " are also starting to change			0
he and his colleagues are trying to mesh the traditional @entity16 " warrior " style with the more cultured flavor of @entity24 and @entity147 , in order to produce players who are comfortable in any type of match situation			1
" with the older age groups of 15 and over , the @entity16 ' warrior ' is still the dominant football force			0
players love street football moves to beat and humiliate an opponent but the game is high tempo , high octane power and speed with an edge of violence , " @entity347 said			2
" conversely with the younger players many coaches are concentrating on manipulating the ball , being comfortable with it , and not being afraid to dribble or pass it when the situation dictates			2
" i suppose the question is how do we keep the tiki - taka with young adulthood from childhood ? testosterone , body changes and finding their niche in society forces players to conform to the warrior or look lesser in others ' eyes			2
" both winner and @entity112 agree that @entity6 needs a new model , and beginning with a detailed look at how @entity24 and @entity147 transformed their fortunes would be a productive starting point			1
in the meantime , until any of these changes take hold , perhaps the best thing for @entity16 fans to do is lower expectations and prepare for an immediate future laden with modest returns			2
" the future is only bleak in terms of winning tournaments -- @entity6 are not going to do that , " said @entity43			1
" but they 'll bring the nation some pleasure and get out of their group most years			0
they qualify for tournaments almost always			0
" we have to change our expectations as a nation , stop having this post-imperial sense that we are entitled to win because we invented the game , and be a bit realistic			0
