-- @entity1 has made a spaghetti western and cross-pollinated it with a blaxploitation picture , but it 's fully formed , unapologetic and easily one of the best popcorn flicks of the year			1
i 'll go further : it 's my favorite @entity7 movie of the past 12 months			2
before we get to the why , a quick outline of what 's in store : " @entity12 " standout @entity13 plays a bounty hunter masquerading as a dentist ( the wagon he drives has a giant molar wobbling on the roof )			1
although he 's @entity20 by birth , he speaks such florid @entity22 most of the @entity7 he encounters have trouble keeping up			2
his name is @entity25 , but he goes by the more distinguished ( and resonant ) dr. @entity26			0
dr. @entity26 is tracking a gang of outlaw brothers , and he enlists the aid of a slave who knows them by sight			0
this would be @entity34 ( @entity35 ) , who starts the movie as a piece of property but becomes dr. @entity26 's business partner and ally			1
@entity34 eventually takes the upper hand , as the pair trespasses onto the notorious @entity44 , the plantation where @entity34 's wife , @entity46 ( @entity46 ) , serves @entity48 aristocrat and sadist @entity49 ( @entity50 )			2
@entity51 helped @entity35 get in ' @entity34 ' character it 's a typical , even quintessential @entity1 gambit : to take two defunct , disreputable genres , dust them off and mash them together			1
it 's what he does : sniff out the nitro and introduce the glycerin			2
lately , in " @entity12 " and again here , he 's added historical flashpoints to the mix for a little extra flare -- and upset those commentators who believe that appropriating history ( @entity66 , slavery ) for the purposes of entertainment automatically trivializes it			0
while @entity1 's morally challenging , emotionally wrenching films carve a different path from the sanctimonious costume dramas made to flatter middlebrow tastes -- and perhaps -- seduce awards voters , they are no less intellectually provocative for it			1
the comparison with " @entity78 " is irresistible -- the two films take place within five years of each other			0
one is grounded in assiduous historical research and offers a shrewd analysis of idealism and political pragmatism , while the other is pure fantasy			0
but it 's the fantasy that truly rattles the chains of slavery , confronting not just the racist assumptions but also the economic power structure that underpinned it -- the paradoxes , hypocrisies and insidious evils that permitted the system to flourish for so long			0
unlike " @entity78 , " " @entity99 " affords room at the heart of its narrative for compelling and assertive @entity105 - @entity7 characters , both heroic ( @entity35 in the title role ) and otherwise ( @entity107 , memorably repellent as a house servant who has become his master 's right hand and confidant )			1
' @entity113 debates : how does movie violence influence violence in real life ? at a time when so many of our movies aspire to be colorblind ( but " urban " film remains largely ghettoized ) , " @entity99 " dares to confront racism as a potent force and a moving target , discovering horror and also grotesque comedy in the niceties of @entity48 etiquette : the way a white landowner can maintain a black mistress , for instance , or tolerate the grumbling of a loyal servant , just so long as everyone knows he will have his dogs tear a runaway limb from limb			2
that may be the film 's true subject , when you get right down to brass tacks : the vacuity of good manners , and the limits of tolerance			0
rambling but in a jaunty , generous , let 's - shoot - the - works fashion , " @entity99 " draws on dozens of westerns -- some of them @entity7 , others from @entity151 and @entity20 -- and includes a very funny travesty of the @entity153 that might have been an outtake from " @entity154			1
" it doffs its hat in the direction of @entity20 mythology , and the soundtrack samples @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 in the process			0
it 's a big , brazen movie , brilliantly acted across the board , one of the best things @entity1 has done			1
@entity34 's ' unchained ' in new trailer			0

" @entity99 " is easily one of the best flicks of 2012 , critic @entity171 says
it 's a typical @entity1 gambit : taking two genres and mashing them together
in the title role , @entity35 teams up with a bounty *hounter*
