@entity10 is far from the only flower fanatic out there : a 2014 study by the @entity23 showed the average wedding costs of $ 28,016 , and including about $ 1,800 for " flowers and decorations			1
" the study estimates bridal bouquets at $ 139 , reception table centerpieces at $ 366 , flower girl flower at $ 86 and flower girl petals at $ 84			1
@entity10 's newest book , " designing with @entity34 , " hits bookstores on april 8			1
@entity0 spoke with him about how to create a floral fantasy for your own wedding -- even if you do n't have a bloomin ' big budget			1
an edited transcript is below			0
@entity0 : why do weddings and flowers go together so well ? @entity10 : the reason is simple			1
flowers have always been a symbol of celebration			0
it 's a great way to convey happiness and beauty			2
if you walk into a room that has flowers , you immediately respond in a very positive way			0
it 's a mood - changing thing			1
it 's dealing with emotions			2
i really got turned on to flowers on one of the cherry blossom weekends in @entity62			0
it was the most incredible thing in the world and i had a moment where i imagined , " what would happen if i could bring this inside ? " @entity0 : flowers are n't just visual			0
what impact are you going for with the rest of the senses ? @entity10 : the scent can almost transport you elsewhere			1
i 've always felt i did a great job when i created a room with beautiful flowers and the guests are so happy and excited that they do n't want to leave			0
i think " ok , i nailed it			0
" i try to create rooms that are so beautiful and powerful , not just visually , but with scent , that people are happy and feel a sense of celebration			0
@entity0 : people have traditional spots for flowers in their wedding -- maybe in a bouquet , as centerpieces or tied to the ends of pews			1
where should they focus their energy ( and budget ) ? @entity10 : flowers do n't need to be only in vases			1
they can be in a napkin or on the table or in the aisle			2
in the book , we have strands blowing in the wind			0
i 'd like to encourage people to think out of the vase , in many different ways that can be exciting			0
you do n't have to limit yourself to arrangements			0
@entity0 : not everyone has a @entity10 - level budget			1
what can they do to get the most bang for their buck ? @entity10 : when i started , my first budget was $ 200			1
i very much believe today what i did then : with a smaller budget , you have to be realistic about the things that are most important			2
in my mind , one of the most important moments is seeing the bride walking down the aisle			2
that 's the first impression , so you want to create a beautiful bouquet			1
[ @entity131 's note : when @entity10 married his husband @entity132 in 2013 at age 63 , he emerged from a giant bridal sculpture that was rolled down the aisle , carrying a bouquet			1
] another important location is the dinner			0
they 're going to be sitting at the table all night , so you want invest some money in a centerpiece or a detail on a napkin			2
i also like to do something beautiful for the escort card arrangement , because that sets the tone for the event			0
but a budget 's a budget			1
it 's a matter of how much you can afford and how much you can do with it			2
concentrate on the areas that are more important and visible and you 'll be just fine			1
@entity0 : when people are buying flowers , what do they need to consider ? @entity10 : a lot of places where you buy flowers , they have matured , and they 're completely open			1
that means that they might only last another half a day			2
you have to know a little bit -- how long they 're going to open , what room temperature they need to open			0
there are flowers that last 10 days and flowers that last one day			2
it is important to do your research			2
if you 're using a florist , they will know this , but if you 're trying to do it yourself , my strongest advice is that if the wedding is not that same day , do n't buy flowers that are completely open , because they 're going to die on your big wedding day			1
@entity0 : yikes ! so how should the flowers be preserved during all the preparation ? @entity10 : you have to keep in mind that flowers are living beings			1
it 's important to always cut the stems at an angle , before you put them in water			1
and i 'm very old - school			2
i do not believe in chemicals of any kind			2
just make sure that you change the water daily			1
they do not like to be in a warm environment , unless you want them to open very quickly			0
make sure there 's a comfortable room temperature if you want them to open slowly , but changing the water daily is my best advice			1
@entity0 : how much attention should couples pay to seasonality ? @entity10 : you should use seasonal flowers			1
it 's much more cost - effective , they 're much more available			1
in the winter , we do not have a lot available ; however , there are flowers like amaryllis , that bloom in december			0
paperwhites bloom then , too , and they can be used as potted plants			0
@entity230 , by the way , is a beautiful flower with one long stem and it 's perfect for a centerpiece			0
after the wedding , you get to keep it for another couple of weeks			0
there are ways that , as a designer , i have to think about what 's more practical for the season			0
if you buy spring flowers in the winter , it 's going to be five times more expensive			1
@entity0 : i 'm sure some of your clients want that ! @entity10 : [ @entity253 ] yes ! you can find them , but it 's a lot of cost and i would not advise that			1
@entity0 : is there some flower you hope you never see again ? @entity10 : i used to say that about carnations , and i changed my mind			1
there are a couple of cultures that like carnations , and i 'm using them now for sculptures instead of just arrangements			0
they 're great because they 're very long - lasting -- it 's like a flower that never dies ! but i always get into trouble when i say this , but i 'm going to say it anyway : i grew up in @entity12 , and in my backyard , there was tons of bird - of - paradise , and we considered them weeds			2
so i 'm not crazy about them			0
@entity0 : what flower would you love for more couples to use ? @entity10 : @entity290 orchids			2
it 's a very deep purple flower , and i think it 's one of the most beautiful orchids around			0
but they are so cost - prohibitive , it 's ridiculous			2
i ca n't wait for the day that somebody creates a less expensive way to make them accessible			0
on the more affordable side : classic roses			0
throughout the year , the cost has been going down because the market is so saturated			0
because so many people have been using them , roses have become very cost - effective			0
@entity0 : let 's say the couple wants to re-create the magic on their first anniversary			0
what would be a fun way to recreate the event on a more intimate scale , florally speaking ? @entity10 : i think it 's great to keep the celebration going and see what flowers you used in your wedding and use them again in a different way			1
i remember one of my clients was celebrating a second anniversary , and we replicated the bride 's bouquet			1
i think that was really great ! celebrate the day with some of the same flowers and i think it could be very meaningful			0
@entity0 : you may or may not be able to answer this question , but what 's the biggest flower budget a client has ever given you to work with ? @entity10 : and you 're absolutely right -- i ca n't answer that			1
it 's such a bummer because i 'm under confidentiality agreements			0
but again , it 's all relative and what 's a lot of money for one person is not for the other			0
how much did you spend on your wedding flowers , and did you get creative ? let us know in the comments below , on @entity352 or on @entity354 's facebook page .			0

@entity10 is known for fantasy floral designs , but the same rules apply on any budget
focus on visible , high - impact areas , like a bride 's bouquet or table centerpieces
research before you buy so you know when they 'll be in full bloom
@entity10 : @entity371 stems at an angle , skip chemicals and change water every day
