@entity1 sen. @entity0 warned on wednesday that the release of the @entity4 's report on the use of torture is causing the @entity8 ' allies to " rethink " their cooperation with the country			1
he also pledged that when republicans take over the @entity4 next month and have control over both chambers of @entity15 , they 'll take steps to be a " check " on president @entity18 's " ill - advised foreign policy			1
" in remarks at the conservative @entity20 , @entity0 declared , " torture is wrong , unambiguously			0
" but he decried the release of what he called a " partisan @entity25 " report as " reckless and irresponsible			0
" " the international repercussions of this partisan report are just beginning , " he said , adding that even " friends and allies across the globe are rethinking " their relationship with the @entity8 @entity0 centered his remarks on an indictment of the " @entity46 " foreign policy , a term he 's used before in criticizing the current administration 's policies and a nod to the fact that he 's contemplating a potential presidential run â€” which could pit him against former secretary of state @entity43 , who is seen as @entity45 ' likely nominee			1
" the consequences of the @entity18 - @entity46 foreign policy is that our friends no longer trust us , and our enemies no longer fear us , " @entity0 said			1
" that is profoundly dangerous for @entity8 and is profoundly dangerous for the world			0
" in particular , he took issue with @entity18 's handling of @entity57 aggression against @entity58 , and he argued that the @entity8 should offer military support to the country to help it ward off @entity57 's attempts at annexation			2
and he slammed the developing @entity64 nuclear deal as " the @entity65 of [ the president 's ] second term			0
" the criticism was reference to deputy national security adviser @entity71 ' recent comparison of a deal with @entity64 to health care reform , the crowning achievement of @entity18 's first term that has faced fierce opposition from @entity12 and remains unpopular with the public			2
@entity0 argued the @entity8 should drop those negotiations immediately and reinstate tougher sanctions , and that any further negotiations should have " more stick and a whole lot less carrot			0
" he also made reference to @entity46 's recent remarks that @entity8 should try to " empathize " with the nation 's enemies , which @entity12 seized on as evidence @entity46 has a lack of understanding of the challenges facing the nation abroad			2
" in the @entity18 - @entity46 foreign policy , all members of the international community are equal , be they nations are not , and should be dealt with respectfully and with empathy , " he said , with a laugh			1
" let me be very clear : when it comes to radical @entity104 terrorists who are crucifying @entity105 , who are beheading children , what our foreign policy needs is not additional empathy			0
it needs clarity and force and resolve to defend the @entity8 , " he said			0
@entity0 concluded by declaring , " we will see some check , i believe , in the next two years on the president 's ill - advised foreign policy " from the new @entity15			1
" there is agreement , and in many ways bipartisan agreement , in the @entity4 that the @entity18 - @entity46 foreign policy is disastrous and is undermining @entity8 in the world			1
and i hope , and expect , the @entity4 , without @entity119 as majority leader , will begin to take up commonsense legislation to strengthen our alliances and stand against our enemies , " he said .			0
