@entity0 -- as world leaders debate what to do about @entity5 , one thing remains clear -- the plight and suffering of the people is only getting worse			1
according to the @entity8 , more than 100,000 @entity5 have died in the conflict and about 2 million @entity5 have fled their country , mostly to @entity11 , @entity0 , and @entity12			1
an estimated 6.8 million people are in desperate need inside @entity5			1
as an aid worker for @entity17 for over a decade , i can attest that this is a humanitarian disaster of historic proportions			2
@entity17 is already supporting nearly 2 million people affected by the crisis , and we are now working around the clock to prepare for a variety of possible scenarios that could play out in the coming days or weeks			2
although we have n't seen any significant change in the number of refugees crossing into @entity0 and @entity11 yet , one likely scenario is a significant increase in refugees , and possibly a flood of families fleeing the violence in @entity5			1
these refugees will have immediate emergency needs -- like food , shelter , water and medical and psychological care -- but neighboring countries that are already hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees are overwhelmed and struggling to support any newcomers			1
i see firsthand the tremendous burden the @entity5 refugees are already placing on countries like @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity0 , and most recently @entity47			1
their limited natural resources are being tapped , their economies are suffering and their own citizens are feeling the strain			0
in @entity0 the influx has caused a spike in the cost of rent , food and basic necessities , and a drop in household incomes as refugees , desperate for work , accept lower than standard wages			2
i recently met @entity63 , a @entity0 small business owner , who has been running a carpentry shop for the past 14 years			0
before the conflict , he had five employees and his business was thriving			0
but in the past two years , his business has suffered			0
he told me : " i used to rent my shop for 350 thousand @entity0 liras , now the price is double			0
i ca n't afford the rent and i had to let my employees go ... i can barely feed my children			0
" this all creates tensions between the host communities and the refugees that has an additional destabilizing effect on the region , and that 's a serious problem			2
the humanitarian response needs to address longer - term needs like creating jobs , while still providing urgently needed immediate assistance			1
despite these challenges , host countries and the international aid community are building transit reception areas to accommodate incoming refugees who may have to wait for immigration processing and registration in the case of a massive influx of new arrivals			1
in @entity11 , we are working closely with the @entity8 and other aid organizations to prepare a new refugee camp ( @entity99 camp ) located east of @entity100			0
we are accelerating our work on providing water and child - friendly spaces , and the camp is scheduled to open in the next two weeks			2
it will accommodate 30,000 refugees upon opening , and can expand to accommodate up to 130,000 refugees			2
@entity17 has pre-positioned aid packages for new refugees , who often arrive with only the clothes they are wearing			0
mattresses , blankets , hygiene kits and baby - kits are on stand - by to meet a possible increased need			0
we are also expanding our child protection programs to ensure young refugees have access to psychosocial support and activities they desperately need to recover from the traumatic events they experience			0
with no solution to the crisis on the horizon , the hope of refugees being able to return home anytime soon is remote			1
i 've spoken with hundreds of refugees over the past year and most of them are realizing it will be a long haul			0
the majority of them do n't see how the divisions that wrack @entity5 will be mended , but no one i have talked with has given up on their dream of returning			1
' slow response ' @entity140 , a teenager from @entity141 who came to @entity0 over a year ago , told me he was so homesick that he actually tried to return			1
despite the fighting , he went back to @entity141 and found his neighborhood destroyed and totally deserted , and could n't stay			0
back in @entity0 , @entity140 told me he no longer cares who wins			0
" i just want the fighting to stop so we can go home and restore our country , " he said			0
currently , the @entity5 humanitarian crisis is woefully underfunded			1
from a private donor standpoint , @entity17 has raised just over $ 1 million for our @entity5 refugee work , mostly from a handful of major donors , but that is over two years			2
for the earthquake in @entity156 ( 2005 ) we raised more than $ 8 million in private donations in about two months			0
without the necessary funding to run desperately needed programs , i am seeing more and more @entity5 families and children facing desperate conditions			2
donor response to slow - onset , conflict - related humanitarian emergencies is always slow compared to rapid - onset natural disasters -- but giving to the @entity5 crisis has been exceptionally slow			1
that said , giving has picked up recently as media coverage has intensified and we are reaching out aggressively to find the resources required to help families fleeing the violence			0
however , as the conflict wears into a third year , governments and individuals need to make more funding available -- not only to the immediate crisis , but for longer - term solutions that include livelihoods and other economic enabling opportunities , and education for over a million refugee children			1
it is also critical that neighboring countries keep their borders open to @entity5 who need to flee the conflict , despite the challenges that these massive , mobile populations can bring with them			1
@entity5 are desperate , and their challenges will almost certainly get worse before they get better			2
this is the most complex humanitarian crisis of our time and it is more critical than ever that the international community strengthen its support			1
