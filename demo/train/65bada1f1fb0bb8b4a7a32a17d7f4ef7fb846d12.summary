-- the family of @entity2 has joined the battle over @entity4 , a 13 - year - old girl on a ventilator who has been declared dead by doctors			1
" together with our team of experts , @entity10 believes @entity4 's case is representative of a very deep problem within the @entity17 healthcare system -- particularly those issues surrounding the deaths of patients within the confines of hospital corporations , which have a vested financial interest in discontinuing life , " the @entity8 said in a prepared statement			1
the organization said it has been overseeing the efforts of several groups to help get @entity4 transferred out of @entity28 and brought " to a safe place			1
" @entity4 's family said tuesday it had found a facility in @entity33 willing to take her			1
the @entity38 hospital " refused to agree to allow us to proceed in that matter , " @entity4 's uncle @entity34 said			1
the hospital denied the accusation			2
" we have done everything to assist the family of @entity4 in their quest to take the deceased body of their daughter to another medical facility , " hospital spokesman @entity40 said			1
" to date , they have been unwilling or unable to provide a physician to perform the procedures necessary , transportation , or a facility that would accept a dead person on a ventilator			2
our hearts and thoughts go out to them in this tragic situation , but the statements being made by their attorney and some family members are misleading and untrue			1
" family attorney @entity64 had accused the hospital of being " hell bent " on ending @entity4 's life			1
a judge has declared @entity4 brain dead as well			1
doctors say there 's no chance she will come back to life			2
@entity34 , @entity4 's uncle , said wednesday that the family still hopes to move her to another facility			1
he accused the hospital of starving his niece by not using a feeding tube to provide her with nutrients			2
@entity40 said a judge tuesday had dismissed the family 's request for additional medical procedures , including a feeding tube			2
a deadline loomed monday as a judge had said the hospital could disconnect the machines after 5 p.m. ( 8 p.m. et )			1
but shortly before @entity4 could have been cut off , that same judge extended his order to 5 p.m. ( 8 p.m. et ) on january 7			1
@entity2 died in 2005 , nearly two weeks after doctors removed the feeding tube that had sustained her for more than a decade			0
she was severely brain damaged and became a national focal point in the right - to - die battle			0
her husband and guardian , @entity2 , said she would n't have wanted to live in her condition , which @entity102 courts deemed a " persistent vegetative state			0
" her parents fought to have her kept alive			0
" persistent vegetative state , " however , means the brain still has some activity , even though the patient is in a deep state of unconsciousness			0
another word for this is " coma , " according to the @entity112			0
@entity2 's parents , brother and sister created the @entity117			2
the statement wednesday about @entity4 included a quote from @entity2 , @entity2 's brother and executive director of the organization			1
" families and individuals must make themselves aware of what so - called ' brain death ' is and what it is not , " he said			0
" every person needs to understand that medical accidents happen every day			0
families and individuals must be more aware of the issue of accountability and patient rights			0
" last month , @entity4 had surgery to remove her tonsils , adenoids and extra sinus tissue			2
doctors had recommended the surgery to treat pediatric obstructive sleep apnea , a condition that made her stop breathing in her sleep and caused other medical problems			0
before the surgery , @entity4 said she was worried that she would never wake up , according to her uncle			1
she seemed fine after the surgery and asked for a popsicle because her throat hurt			0
it was n't long before something went terribly wrong			0
in the intensive care unit , the girl began bleeding profusely -- an image that her mother told @entity0 would be forever seared in her mind			0
according to family members , @entity4 went into cardiac arrest			1
days later , she was declared brain dead			0
hospital officials have said privacy laws prevent them from discussing details of the case			0
