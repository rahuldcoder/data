-- the premiere plastic guitar game just flamed out			0
@entity2 , beset by falling sales , has decided to shutter the division that created " @entity5 " and its sequels			1
it 's an ignominious exit for a title that was once touted as the first great game franchise of the 21st century			1
" @entity5 " was created in 2005 by indie studio @entity10 , in collaboration with @entity12 , which had previously found success with the " @entity15 " franchise			1
" @entity15 , " where players plugged microphones into their consoles and were scored on the accuracy of their singing , was the first game to show a significant number of videogamers were interested in making " music			0
" @entity10 's " @entity5 " proved they were equally interested in shredding a plastic guitar			1
@entity2 purchased the franchise in 2006 for $ 100 million ; to date it has shipped more than 25 million units for a roughly $ 2 billion roi			1
" @entity30 : @entity30 " made $ 1 billion on its own			0
@entity12 went on to publish the highly successful " @entity37 " franchise , which added drums , microphones and keyboards to the plastic guitar mix. how the mighty have fallen			2
the holiday season was a disastrous one for the music game genre			0
@entity12 was sold by @entity39 to a consortium of shareholders ; the terms were undisclosed , but it was reported to be a fire sale			0
@entity44 , which collaborated with @entity12 on " @entity37 , " was shut down			0
" @entity45 : warriors of @entity51 , " the sixth title in the series , received lackluster reviews and even more lackluster sales			1
@entity2 posted a $ 233 million net loss for the fourth quarter			0
its decision to lay off the 500 - person " @entity5 " division was , @entity2 said in a press release today , " due to continued declines in the music genre			1
" so what stopped the music ? the first culprit : oversaturation			0
there are just too many games competing in the genre ( " @entity65 " and " @entity66 , " anyone ? ) , with too many pricey controllers			0
a " @entity71 " guitar bundle will set you back $ 80			0
considering many of the controllers do not play nice with similar games , that 's a lot of dough to drop on pretend jamming			2
secondly , there 's the novelty factor			2
the dynamics of the game changed little from one title to the next , despite the introduction of innovations such as a touch - sensitive slide bar on later guitar controllers			2
at a certain stage , users are going to be more interested in picking up a real guitar			2
the series also felt like it was running out of great rock anthems for users to emulate			1
reviews of " @entity71 " complained that the set list seemed dull and full of synth - heavy tunes			0
finally , of course , @entity2 is n't going to stop actually selling " @entity5 " titles any time soon			1
if you 're interested in becoming a maestro of the pretend @entity99 , you can still pick up the " @entity5 " back catalog and buy extra songs online			1
" @entity5 " and " @entity37 " may one day be seen as a classic party game , pulled out of the closet at holidays and special gatherings , the way we play monopoly or @entity108 today			1
maybe it 's time you introduced @entity110 to the plastic guitar			0
