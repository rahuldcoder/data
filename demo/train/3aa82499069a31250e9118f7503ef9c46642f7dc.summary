-- sometimes i can still taste the cement dust			1
when the second tower collapsed , there was no place for me to hide			1
a tornado of black smoke drove me into the ground and filled my mouth with chewable soot			2
splayed on the sidewalk , in total darkness , there was nothing i could do except wait and pray for the pelting to stop			2
a continuous shower of debris rained on my head , shoulders , and back			1
i could n't tell when it would end because i could n't even see my hands			2
feeling around my surroundings with my fingers , i determined i was n't trapped			2
within minutes , a triage tag was forced around my neck and i was taken by ambulance to the hospital			1
doctors in the @entity30 cut off my clothes and stuck a tube down my throat to see if my lungs were burned			2
one of the lucky ones			2
how do we make sense of a morning like that ? throughout the country , but certainly most palpably in @entity41 , there was a stark before and after -- a period when routines were questioned and familiar steps felt shaky			1
we quit jobs that were n't fulfilling ; couples got married or divorced ; and a lot of us got pregnant , choosing to double down on love instead of loss			2
for me , at least at first , it meant doing my job			0
i was a producer at @entity52 , and as soon as a nurse agreed to give me a phone , i called the newsroom and reported from my gurney			0
within a year , i had co-edited " covering catastrophe : broadcast journalists report september 11 , " donating the proceeds to 9/11 - related charities			1
the @entity61 and @entity62 now has the rights to the book to support its programming and exhibitions in perpetuity			1
the museum opened thursday for a dedication ceremony , attended by president @entity70 , rescuers and victims ' relatives			1
the president called the museum a " sacred place of healing and of hope			0
" thirteen years after the attacks , the nation finally has a place to learn about the horrors of that day and honor the heroism			0
journalists are often taught to distance themselves from the people and stories they cover			0
do n't get too close , we 're warned ; it will ruin your objectivity			0
the rules blurred on 9/11			1
we ran for our lives alongside everyone else			0
we were covered in the same ash and were choking on the same smoke			0
suddenly , the old journalism playbook seemed obsolete			0
it was ok to relate to the story and be part of it , too			0
this sea change in thinking has allowed journalists to reveal themselves in ways unprecedented in the history of journalism			0
and it 's why i 'm honored to have recorded my oral history for the museum and so deeply humbled that the triage tag that identified me as a survivor so many years ago will be on display			1
i will be able to see that triage tag on monday , when collection donors are invited to visit the museum before it opens to the public on wednesday			1
museum officials tell me it 's one of several survivor artifacts and is displayed alongside a written portion of my story			0
i am not sure what my reaction will be in encountering this section of the exhibition , but no matter what , i 'll be feeling a deep sense of kinship with all the other survivors in the room			0
we lived through an experience that bonds us forever			0
september 11 could have gone very differently for me			1
my hope is that by supporting the @entity135 , i am , in some small way , honoring those who died and recognizing fully that i am still one of the lucky ones .			1
