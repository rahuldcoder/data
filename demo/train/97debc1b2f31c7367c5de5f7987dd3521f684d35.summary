nearly two years before he shot and killed a 12 - year - old who had an air gun , @entity4 police officer @entity3 resigned from another police job after a supervisor described him as " distracted and weepy " and " emotionally immature			1
" records from the @entity8 obtained by @entity9 include comments from a supervisor detailing what they called " a pattern of lack of maturity , indiscretion and not following instructions , " a " dangerous loss of composure during live range training " and an " inability to manage personal stress			1
" " i do not believe time , nor training , will be able to change or correct these deficiencies , " @entity24 deputy chief @entity23 wrote in a november 2012 memo			0
now @entity3 , who could not be immediately reached for comment , is one of two @entity4 police officers under investigation after the fatal shooting of 12 - year - old @entity33 last month			1
police have said the boy was shot after pulling out an air gun that looked like a real firearm			2
@entity3 joined the @entity38 in march			2
a @entity40 spokesman said thursday that during a background check before hiring @entity3 , his department did n't review the officer 's personnel file from @entity24 , a suburb south of the city			1
detectives did speak with the @entity24 human resources director , the spokesman said			0
" during that interview detectives inquired if there were any disciplinary actions or incidents that @entity40 should be aware of prior to hiring @entity3 , at which point they were told there were none , " sgt. @entity48 said			1
" the reason for departure indicated was resignation			0
officer @entity3 indicated that he resigned for personal reasons , which was substantiated by the @entity61			1
" according to the records , @entity3 worked at the @entity8 as an officer until december 2012 , when he submitted his resignation " for personal reasons " after he was told that a disciplinary process of separation had begun			1
@entity3 's inability to perform basic functions as instructed , and his inability to emotionally function because of a personal situation at home with an on and off again girlfriend leads one to believe that he would not be able to substantially cope , or make good decisions , during or resulting from any other stressful situation , " @entity69 wrote			0
