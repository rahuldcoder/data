@entity0 -- how do you sell a missile ? giving it a name that conjures up images of destruction or protection is a good start ; weapons called " @entity12 defense system " or " @entity13 " are unequivocal			1
however , a fearsome title alone wo n't clinch a multi-million dollar sale , so military trade events like air shows give weapons manufacturers a chance to show off their products -- even if the hard sell has been done over months and years of networking and negotiations			1
" there 's no new business here , but new sales prospects , " says @entity24 of @entity25			1
the @entity31 arms maker 's stall at the @entity32 has a full size simulator of their anti-aircraft defense system , the prosaically named @entity35			1
like similar demo models in the voluminous hall , it attracted the attention of passing visitors , and some potential new customers , commonly referred to as " pop - ups			0
" doing military 's dangerous , dull and dirty work demonstrated by @entity24 's colleague @entity46 , it seems more like playing a video game with a cool piece of kit than a weapon capable of blasting an enemy jet out of the sky			2
" systems are getting more technical , so making them easy to operate is a strong selling point , " says @entity46			1
over the years the @entity35 has been sold in 18 countries , though @entity46 says he does n't think it 's ever been used in a combat situation			0
while plenty of technical detail and test footage can be used in support of any demo , being able to say a weapon has been used in combat situations gives it far more kudos			2
" most of our products are combat proven , " says @entity66 of @entity68 's @entity67 , standing next to full - size models of missiles			1
" we live in a test range , unfortunately it 's one of our advantages			0
there is a big difference between a @entity81 presentation and combat - proven systems			2
" some manufacturers are less keen to talk to people outside the industry about what their weapons do , but @entity88 is happy to describe the capability of some of @entity67 's munitions , including a new short - range " @entity92 " -- " the baby of the group " -- that he claims can be directed from kilometers away through any window of your choice			1
" you have to know how to fit yourself to the customers needs ... sometimes you have to make tailor - made things , " he says			0
" people come to us and say , ' look we have a problem with our border , what solutions can you give us ? ' " most of the military products on display are marketed as defensive rather than offensive , with " protecting assets " and " commanding combat zones " being common terms			1
missiles are increasingly promoted for their accuracy and ability to minimize collateral damage -- confirming a trend that so much modern warfare takes place in urban or civilian areas			0
some are surrounded in obfuscating terms and industry jargon , like blast patterns , @entity127 -- that refers to a weapon 's accuracy -- or j - effect , when a bomb bounces and does n't explode			0
others are more upfront about what their munitions actually do			0
@entity135 , @entity137 's largest missile manufacturer and owned by the continents big aerospace companies , has a promotional video playing on its stand showing weapons destroying moving cars and other real targets in combat in @entity146 and @entity147			2
" i would say that our customers have been over satisfied with how our systems have worked , " says @entity135 's @entity148 , in reference to their use by the @entity153 and @entity154 air force in the recent conflict in @entity147			1
but regardless of how a weapon is marketed it 's getting harder to sell , as more countries are trying to become manufacturers and not just purchasers			1
" the whole industry is currently changing			0
it 's harder to sell ( in the @entity166 region ) , mainly because of stricter rules and anti-corruption measures , " says @entity24			0
" now it 's a lot more about transfer of technology ( between countries ) and partnerships			0
" in the end to sell your products you simply need to be the best at the cheapest price			2
