-- this year 's @entity1 in @entity2 could be the most difficult for @entity3			1
he 's the festival 's organizer who over 15 years has faced down typhoons and musicians ' monstrous egos to successfully host the annual three day music festival in the picturesque mountains of western @entity2			2
but with the aftermath of the march earthquake and tsunami still unfolding in the northeast of the country , @entity3 is looking for ways to mark the gravity of the situation while allowing the thousands who visit each year to unwind and enjoy themselves			0
" i think it will be a very emotional time for my staff and the audience , " he says			0
" we watched , like everyone else , the whole thing on tv			0
it is very hard to put into words my feeling as i have many friends in the disaster region and it 's my country			2
" " @entity41 " ( self - restraint ) has been added to the collective somber mood across the county and like many businesses in @entity2 , public events and festivals have suffered as a result			1
hundreds of local cultural events and festivities have been cancelled or postponed indefinitely in the few months following the disaster			2
the @entity47 and @entity48 music festival were called off and it was reported that @entity2 's biggest classical music concert , @entity50 , saw a large number of its musicians pull out			1
while some have been cancelled out of respect for the suffering of those in the disaster - hit area , some have been affected by the apprehension of some to visit @entity2 in troubled times ; tourism to @entity2 has been hit hard , with a drop of 50 % in visitor numbers in march 2011 compared with 12 months earlier			1
@entity64 , @entity3 's co-producer of @entity1 , says that none of the bands has pulled out of their event scheduled for the end of july because of fears surrounding the nuclear crisis at the @entity73 power plant			1
however he admitted that ticket sales over the past couple of months had been much slower than in previous years			1
@entity3 says he had to reassure many international bands that it would be safe for them to play at the festival , yet many of them responded really positively to the crisis with some joining the " @entity85 " charity concert that took place in @entity84 last month			0
in many ways @entity3 believes the festival will be more vital than ever this year			0
" ( it will be ) the first major gathering and a time for release of all the terrible times and tension that has been winding up inside			0

natural disaster and nuclear crisis has affected @entity2 's collective mood
festivals and events have been cancelled ; @entity1 still planned for july
