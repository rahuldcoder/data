-- when the jack - o ' - lanterns have all burned out and the candy wrappers have been swept away , @entity1 wo n't be hanging a " closed " sign in the window of the @entity7 's @entity6 , the haunted mansion he runs in the small @entity10 town of @entity11			1
with its twisted passageways , secret tunnels and reported sightings of a " @entity16 , " the eerie 19th - century house draws visitors all year long -- and @entity1 accommodates them			1

" why not try to have as much fun as you can ? " for those who relish the macabre and dressing up , october 31 does n't have to spell the end of the fright season			0
from ghostly attractions to @entity20 specialty shops , a small contingent of businesses can make it a year - long holiday			1
costumes for every season once november hits , @entity40 , vice president of @entity41 , a store that sells costumes , decorations and props , barely has time to take a breath before she 's at her first trade show , getting ready to place orders for the next @entity20 season			1
@entity41 , which occupies 25,000 square feet of retail space in @entity50 , is open year - round			1
october is by far the store 's busiest month , she says , but business is brisk the rest of the year			1
" vegas is a party town where everyone is always dressing up			0
there 's always a little more fun going on			2
all the bars and nightclubs do themed events in the off - season , " says @entity60			2
quiz : know your ghosts from your goblins ? being a year - round operation gives the massive store , which also houses a warehouse for its online business , an edge over the flurry of temporary shops that pop up during the @entity20 season			1
" we cater to our clientele			0
we 'll stock a lot more product than a temporary store will ever stock , " @entity60 says , adding that the store 's own " haunted hallway " is an attraction in itself			1
the idea of @entity20 as a year - round industry is growing , albeit slowly , she says			1

@entity20 - inspired attractions like haunts are n't just a passing fad			2
they 're " now part of the culture , " says @entity105			0
year - round attractions are still in the minority , but that 's mainly due to their business models			1

but the demand is there , he says			0
" this generation is a non-spectator generation			0
they want to participate in an experience			0
" for a small operator like @entity1 , it makes sense to keep going the way he has			0
up to a dozen people might help out around @entity20 , but for the rest of the year , he 's a one - man show			1
whether in june or october , he starts every tour in the same place			0
standing in the parlor , he begins telling the history of the house of horrors in his gravelly voice			0
and even though he 's been at it for a quarter - century , it does n't get tiresome			2
" i never get tired of hearing people laughing and screaming , " he says			0
" i have tremendous fun			0
no one has more fun than i do			0
i hope to be doing this when i 'm 95 years old			0
