-- trial lawyers use an expression -- " you ca n't unring a bell " -- after a jury is exposed to something damaging			2
even if a judge commands people to disregard that something , the harm is done once the words have been uttered			0
@entity12 may be wishing that several ringing bells sounded in his attorney 's opening statement last week could be unrung , beginning with a now infamous joke			1
after a streamlined prosecution opening in which a rapt courtroom was told of efforts to resuscitate @entity22 's lifeless form and heard a straightforward argument that @entity12 shot @entity22 " because he wanted to , not because he had to , " @entity12 's attorney @entity17 chose to open his defense by telling a joke			1
resorting to humor -- even in traffic court -- is fraught with risk , but seems a particularly unwise idea at the outset of a murder case in which the defense must counter the appearance of casual and callous indifference on @entity12 's part			1
even worse , perhaps , it runs the risk of appearing to trivialize the trial itself			1
( the joke chosen even implies that selected jurors who were n't savvy enough to dodge their civic duty will now have their time wasted			2
) prosecutors will tell you that the most significant challenge to securing a guilty verdict is to persuade initially resistant jurors to grasp the gravity of a case , making them at least open to returning a guilty verdict			0
several post-joke comments made by @entity17 in his opening could unwittingly pave a path to conviction			0
@entity17 said that it was a dangerous dog in @entity12 's neighborhood that forced his hand , necessitating that he buy a 9 mm @entity62 automatic firearm			1
the attorney matter - of - factly suggested it was the @entity66 way for an ordinary person , faced with an uncontrolled animal in his community , to procure a firearm			2
( firing shots at a menacing dog could easily imperil others , of course			0
) arguing that during the confrontation with @entity22 , @entity12 's head was struck against the pavement , @entity17 told the jury : " when you get your bell rung , stuff happens			1
" while defending an emotional case like this is admittedly a tricky high - wire act , these words suggest an act of vengeance by an armed man rather than a genuine effort to avoid death			0
it will not be surprising to hear those words repeated back in the prosecution 's closing statement			0
five of the six jurors are mothers for whom " stuff happens " may seem an insufficient accounting for the termination of a life cut short shy of two decades			0
by his lawyer 's account , @entity12 's worries were not confined to perceived community dangers , but to his own physical well - being			1
he wanted to learn martial arts , @entity17 said , but washed out of fight school , where he was described as too " soft			0
" many defense attorneys deliver short openings or do n't open at all because of the risk of a bad backfire			1
@entity114 's lengthy opening resulted in a composite picture of a person who easily conjures threats and fears , sought a gun as a leveler for his insecurities and whose response to these perceived threats could be seen as questionable and retaliatory			0
criminal defendants are not only at the mercy of the state 's awesome powers , but also must live with the tactical decisions of their attorney			2
trying to persuade an appeals court to overturn your conviction because of detrimental choices made by your lawyers at trial is all but impossible			0
on monday , the prosecution resorted to the often potent technique of using a defendant 's inconsistent statements in an attempt to collapse his believability and blunt possible jury empathy for him			0
prosecutors showed a video of @entity12 giving an expansive explanation of what happened during a scene walk - through the day after the shooting , followed by playing a lengthy taped interview that was conducted by @entity152 police a couple of days later			1
the prosecution hopes that jurors will agree that the more @entity12 explains his actions , the more self - serving he sounds , and the less trustworthy he will appear , something vitally important for someone who , when all is said and done , offers the only account detailed enough to justify using lethal force			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity163 .			2

@entity163 : in @entity12 's trial , his attorney began with a bad joke
@entity163 : resorting to humor in a trial is fraught with risk of appearing too casual
he says the defense must counter the appearance of callous indifference
@entity163 : the more self - serving @entity12 sounds , the less trustworthy he appears
