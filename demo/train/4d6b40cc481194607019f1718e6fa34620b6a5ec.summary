@entity0 was the favorite holiday for @entity2 's family			1
she , her brother and parents would open presents , go to the movies and shoot fireworks they had saved from july			0
but this holiday season , says @entity2 's mother , @entity10 , has been " a living hell			1
" @entity2 , 33 , has been brain dead since her husband , @entity16 , discovered her unconscious at home on november 26 , @entity12 said			1
the family says she is being kept alive on a ventilator at @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 , even though she would not want her life prolonged by a machine			1
@entity21 state law says life - sustaining treatment can not be withheld from a pregnant patient , regardless of her wishes or the age of the fetus			1
and @entity2 was 14 weeks pregnant when she became hospitalized ; now she 's at 18 weeks			1
@entity2 's family wants to see that law rewritten or repealed			1
" i ca n't imagine their intent would be for someone so young in pregnancy , at 14 weeks , to have them on life support until mid-may , " @entity12 said			1
@entity12 hopes to go before the @entity21 legislature to argue that when it comes to cases like this , " one size does not fit all , " she said			1
but the family is not yet at the point of hiring a lawyer to pursue that , she said			2
" we 're frankly waiting to see how long this lasts , " she said			0
" there 's so much energy just trying to cope with what we see every time we go into @entity54			2
and knowing our daughter is not there , but her body is being kept alive , is hard to see			2
" husband of pregnant woman wants her off life support unknowns about the fetus @entity12 saw her daughter no more than five hours before she fell unconscious on the kitchen floor at her home			1
doctors wo n't know for sure the cause of death until @entity2 has an autopsy , but they suspect she had a pulmonary embolism , @entity12 said			1
@entity12 fears that oxygen deprivation could have damaged the fetus			0
doctors told the family it has a heartbeat in a normal range , @entity16 told @entity79 , and at 24 weeks they may know more about its viability			2
" we still have about a month to go before we have more answers to questions about what 's going to happen next , " @entity12 said			2
although there are tests at the fetal stage that can pick up on problems , they can not provide certainty about normal development , experts say			0
" we do n't have very precise measurements of fetal wellbeing , " dr. @entity95 , neonatologist at @entity96 in @entity97 , @entity98 , who is not involved with the case			0
based on the available facts , @entity95 said , there is a possibility of a good outcome for a fetus born to a woman in @entity2 's situation			1
doctors will likely examine the appearance of the fetus , looking for indications of developmental issues , he said			0
for example , microcephaly , often indicated by abnormal growth of the fetus 's head , can be a sign of developmental issues			2
it 's a lot easier to predict bad outcomes than good , @entity95 said			0
the tests that doctors could perform , including an mri of the fetal brain , ca n't assure normal development later			0
" it 's like photograph of a baseball player , " he said			0
" you can see how they stand			0
they 've got great position , hold the bat well			0
but until you put them in action , until you test that function of the brain , you ca n't tell whether it 's going to work well			2
" a law to protect unborn children the larger situation is a complicated one , involving competing interests and personal choices of individuals , state and federal regulations , as well as the right to life of the mother and child , @entity95 said			1
@entity2 never filled out an advance directive stating what she would want to happen medically in a situation like this , if she could not express her own wishes			2
but @entity12 said @entity2 had spoken several times to her parents and husband about it			2
" we talked about it			0
we 're both paramedics , " @entity164 told @entity166 affiliate @entity79			0
" we 've seen things out in the field			0
we both knew that we both did n't want to be on life support			1
" even if she had signed such a document , though , @entity21 law would override her wishes because she is pregnant			1
" the state has a compelling interest in preserving the life of its unborn citizens , " criminal defense attorney @entity174 told @entity166 's @entity175			2
" and that interest is superior to even the interest of the remaining family that might be charged with raising an ill child			0
" the hospital that is treating @entity2 says it is adhering to the law			1
" at all times , we will follow the law as it is applicable to health care in the state of @entity21			1
and state law here says you can not withhold or withdraw life sustaining treatment for a pregnant patient , " @entity191 , vice president of communications and community affairs for @entity193 , said			1
" it 's that clear			0
" @entity201 , director of the @entity202 at @entity203 , told @entity166 's @entity175 that he finds the law too restrictive			2
" given these variables , i think the @entity21 law does n't give enough room to have this discussion we 're having , which is : are you sure that 's what she would want , are you sure the fetus could live , are you sure the fetus has n't been harmed ? " he said			1
a difficult @entity0 @entity2 's brother unexpectedly died four years ago , at age 22			1
@entity12 and her husband suddenly find themselves without children of their own			0
they have been taking care of @entity2 's 14 - month - old son @entity225 for the last week			1
while out shopping for milk for the boy on monday , @entity12 broke down in tears when she came across marshmallows -- one of her daughter 's beloved treats			0
" i thought , normally , i 'd pick up a bag for her , " @entity12 said , crying			0
" it was hard to see something as simple as a bag of marshmallows			0
" @entity225 loves marshmallows , too			0
