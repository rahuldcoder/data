@entity0 -- @entity2 is a struggle shared by all freshly arrived refugees in the @entity5			1
but starting life anew has been that much tougher for @entity10 , the woman who came to embody the cruelty of @entity13 's regime in the midst of @entity16 's brutal civil war			1
she lives every day with the scars of the rape she alleges was committed by @entity13 's thugs			1
sometimes , she said in an exclusive interview with @entity1 , she gets so depressed that she does n't leave her apartment for days			2
other times , she ca n't even get out of bed for three or four days			2
" i cry all the time just like little children , " she says wiping dry her moist eyes			2
" and i always smile , too			2
" @entity27 found relief on these shores when she arrived here last summer			1
she finally felt safe , unlike in @entity16 , where she felt constantly in danger and her family was threatened			1
but she has found it hard to make ends meet			2
she said she has been going to the employment office for four months but job opportunities have been slim			2
" when i came , i never imagined life would be this hard , " she said			2
" as we say in @entity16 , you have to kill yourself working			1
i wish there was work			2
there are no work opportunities			0
" her family in @entity16 sends her $ 300 a month			1
without that , she said , she would not have made it so far			0
out of desperation , last week , @entity46 bought a one - way ticket from @entity49 to @entity0 with money from an @entity52 family			1
she had all but $ 100 in her bag ; she used $ 65 of it and took a taxi to the @entity56 in @entity0			1
she came with a distrust of politicians and diplomats but with hope in her heart that her compatriots would not turn her away			0
but @entity16 ambassador @entity63 , she said , spoke to her like a father			1
he offered her an educational stipend			0
" it means everything to me , " she said , opening up an envelope containing check for $ 1,800			0
" it 's not about whether it 's a lot or little			2
it 's about the time that i got it , " she said			2
it was like winning the lottery			0
otherwise , she might have wound up on the street in a few days			0
@entity63 said he thought @entity46 needs help			0
" i told her one thing , " he said			0
" you have to close the doors to the past and look to the future			0
she can not live in misery the rest of her life			0
" @entity27 first caught the world 's attention in march when she burst into @entity93 's @entity92 , where foreign journalists were staying , and publicly accused members of @entity13 's forces of gang - raping her			1
she screamed that she had been taken from a checkpoint and held against her will for two days while being beaten and raped by 15 of @entity13 's militiamen			1
security officials said @entity46 was " mentally ill " and was being taken to a " hospital			0
" they dragged her unceremoniously to a waiting white car and whisked her away			0
she was n't heard from for more than a week , but eventually in media interviews , she spoke of her ordeal			0
she fled to @entity105 in may with the help of a defected military officer and the @entity16 rebels , then in the thick of civil war			1
she found temporary sanctuary in @entity111 before being granted asylum in the @entity5			1
@entity27 arrived in @entity113 at the end of july and with the help of a refugee agency , she was resettled in @entity49			1
she has no family in the @entity5 , and she would perhaps like to return to her homeland one day			1
" of course , there is no one who does n't wish to go back to his country , " she said			0
" but i am not mentally ready for that			0
i also feel personally i am not ready to integrate back into society , i am not ready			0
i feel life is hard for me because it is different -- in culture ... language -- everything is different here			1
" @entity27 can not know the twists and turns her life will take from here			1
she wants to finish schooling			0
five years from now , she pictures herself as a mother			0
one thing she knows though			0
if and when she returns home , it will be to a @entity16 without @entity13			1
she just wishes @entity13 had met proper justice			1
she felt his killers did him a favor by ending his life			0
in the eyes of some , he became a martyr			0
" they should n't have given him this honor , " she said			0
he should have been tried for his crimes , she said -- for what he did to the people of @entity16 , for what he did to her			1
@entity1 's @entity150 reported from @entity0 and @entity151 reported from @entity152			1
@entity1 's @entity153 contributed to this report .			2

@entity10 arrived in the @entity5 in july
it has been hard to get a job , learn a new language , adapt to a new culture
she bought a one - way ticket to seek help at the @entity16 *embassy* in @entity0
