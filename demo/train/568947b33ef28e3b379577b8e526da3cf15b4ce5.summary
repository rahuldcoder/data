-- the @entity1 was once the world 's fourth - largest lake			1
now much of it is a vast toxic desert straddling the borders of @entity6 and @entity7 , two former @entity9 states in central @entity10			0
in recently released images , @entity12 's @entity11 shows the extent of the lake 's recession over the past 14 years			1
the damage reached its peak this year , when the eastern lobe of the @entity20 -- which actually was the center of the original lake -- dried up completely			1
until the 1960s , the @entity1 was fed by two rivers , the @entity25 and @entity26 , which brought snowmelt from mountains to the southeast , and local rainfall			0
but in the 1960s the @entity9 diverted water from the two rivers into canals to supply agriculture in the region			1
with the loss of water , the lake began to recede and its salinity levels began to rise			2
fertilizers and chemical runoff contaminated the lake bed			0
as the lakebed became exposed , winds blew the contaminated soil onto the surrounding croplands , meaning even more water was needed to make the land suitable for agriculture , according to an @entity11 release			2
the falling water levels changed the local climate , too			0
without the lake water to moderate temperatures , winters became colder and summers hotter , the @entity11 said .			0

eastern lobe of what is now known as the @entity20 has dried up completely
recent images from @entity12 's @entity11 show stages of the lake 's decline
*disaster* began with @entity9 - era diversion of lake 's *tributaries* for agriculture
rising salinity , chemical contamination *furthered* the *calamity*
