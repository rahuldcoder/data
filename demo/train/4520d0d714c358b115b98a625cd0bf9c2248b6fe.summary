-- a @entity2 court has vacated the murder conviction of former @entity5 agent @entity4 , the informant handler of convicted @entity7 mob boss @entity6 , according to court documents			1
citing a statute of limitations issue , the @entity9 reversed the 2008 second - degree murder conviction for @entity4 's alleged role in the 1982 death of a @entity2 businessman			1
in 2005 @entity4 was charged with first - degree premeditated murder and conspiracy to commit first - degree murder			0
during his 2008 trial , prosecutors presented evidence that in 1982 , @entity4 , then an @entity5 agent , schemed with @entity6 and the @entity23 gang to kill businessman @entity24			1
it was revealed in court that @entity4 , @entity6 and associates met over several weeks before the slaying , but it was " undisputed " that hit man @entity31 , and not @entity4 , fired the murder weapon			1
the jury convicted @entity4 of second - degree murder with a firearm , a lesser included offense of first - degree murder			2
the @entity9 on wednesday determined that prosecutors had incorrectly requested that the jury be allowed to convict on second - degree murder with a weapon , instead of first - degree murder , because @entity4 's gun was not used in the crime			1
this allowance , the court said , subsequently reclassified and elevated @entity4 's conviction to a crime with a potential life sentence without a statute of limitation			2
@entity4 was sentenced to 40 years in prison in 2009			0
in the 2 - 1 decision , the court reasoned , " without the fundamentally erroneous reclassification " of this murder charge to second - degree murder with a weapon , @entity4 's conviction would have been barred by the applicable four - year statute of limitations			2
the court vacated the conviction and remanded the case to the trial court , ordering that @entity4 be discharged , adding that the " discharge shall be stayed until any and all post-appeal motions are final			0
the @entity65 attorney 's office in @entity7 expressed disappointment about the ruling			0
" today a @entity2 appeals court , in a split decision , reversed itself after unanimously affirming @entity4 's murder conviction three years ago			1
the decision is surprising and disheartening , " the office said in a statement			0
" this case was hard fought and led to the successful prosecution of a deeply corrupt federal agent			0
we intend to urge the @entity2 attorney general to challenge this decision			0
" @entity4 allegedly accepted payoffs and , in turn , tipped off @entity6 and his associate @entity81 to the identities of cooperating witnesses and pending investigations , according to information revealed in court during @entity6 's racketeering trial last year			1
@entity4 was serving a 40 - year sentence on second - degree murder charges for allegedly leaking the identity of @entity91 , who had agreed to cooperate against @entity6 's @entity92			1
during the first two decades of his @entity5 career , @entity4 won kudos in the bureau 's @entity7 office , cultivating informants against @entity99 mobsters			2
prosecutors during his trial said @entity4 was corrupted by his two highest - ranking snitches : @entity6 and @entity103			0
@entity4 retired from the @entity5 in 1990 and later was indicted on federal racketeering and other charges stemming from his long relationship with @entity6 and @entity103			1
he was convicted of racketeering in 2002 and was serving a 10 - year federal prison sentence when he was indicted in 2005 in the @entity91 slaying			0
@entity6 gets 2 life sentences plus 5 years @entity6 housed at federal prison in @entity112 @entity0 's @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 contributed to this report .			0
