@entity0 -- another month , another weak jobs report			2
and do n't expect @entity3 to do much about it anytime soon			1
with unemployment stuck above 8 % , congressional @entity4 and @entity5 blasted each other friday for blocking legislation that would help create new jobs and spark stronger economic growth			1
both parties have a number of proposals on the table , but with the campaign now in full swing neither side expects anything to pass before @entity18			2
" the president needs to stop betting on his failed policies and start working with republicans to remove government obstacles to job creation , " said @entity20 speaker @entity19 , @entity21			0
" we 've passed more than 30 jobs bills -- he should call on @entity4 to stop stalling them			2
" senate majority leader @entity29 , @entity30 , ripped the @entity5 for deciding " they would rather focus their energy on political grandstanding and empty , partisan exercises that will not create a single job			1
" who 's right ? it depends on your point of view			0
@entity3 is not completely incapable of action			1
in april , for example , legislators passed the @entity43 -- or @entity44 -- @entity45 , which provides small businesses in need of capital with a range of options that were previously out of reach			0
the provisions are aimed primarily at helping fast - growing operations like biotech and tech companies			0
last week , @entity3 cleared a $ 105 billion bill funding transportation projects for two years and preventing a doubling of the student loan rate			1
but most analysts believe growing campaign pressure and @entity62 's cavernous ideological divide will combine to make further legislative progress nearly impossible			1
next week , the @entity5 - controlled @entity20 will likely pass -- for a second time -- a bill repealing @entity66 , the president 's controversial health care overhaul			1
@entity5 know the measure is dead on arrival in the @entity70 - controlled @entity4 , but they 're trying to score political points by keeping the issue front and center in the wake of the @entity76 ruling upholding the law			1
@entity19 has also promised votes later this month on a @entity5 tax reform measure and a bill to , in the speaker 's words , " curtail excessive government regulations			1
" @entity29 , meanwhile , is promising a vote next week on small business tax cut measure " designed to reward hiring and provide incentives for payroll growth			0
" the bill , sponsored by @entity90 @entity70 sen. @entity89 , would offer substantial writeoffs for new equipment purchases while also extending new tax credits for payroll expansions			0
for their part , @entity95 and presumptive @entity5 presidential nominee @entity96 both have a number of proposals on the table			1
@entity95 rolled out a $ 447 billion job growth plan last september , but the blueprint was never approved by either chamber			0
@entity4 then broke the measure up into a number smaller parts -- including the @entity45			0
the strategy met with mixed results and now appears to have stalled			0
@entity96 's plan includes a 20 % cut in marginal tax rates , a repeal of both the estate tax and @entity115 , and a cut in the corporate tax rate from 35 % to 25 % , among other things			0
he 'd also repeal the @entity120 financial regulatory reform bill and give a green light to complete construction of the @entity123 , a project that splits @entity70 labor and environmental groups , and has been put on hold by @entity95			0
the bottom line as far as @entity3 is concerned , however , is that @entity95 embraces traditional @entity70 stimulus ideas like expanding the public sector workforce , spending more on infrastructure , and pushing targeted tax cuts aimed primarily at middle and lower income families			2
@entity96 and his congressional allies hew to a more traditional @entity5 agenda of sweeping tax reduction and slashing federal red tape for domestic energy producers and others			2
do n't expect a divided @entity3 to give either side a win -- especially before voters go to the polls on november 6 .			2

*democrats* and @entity5 blame each other for @entity3 's failure to pass a new jobs bill
@entity3 is unlikely to take further legislative action after passing the transportation bill
@entity3 is stymied by deep ideological divisions and *election* year pressures
