-- on march 18 , a @entity3 warlord known as @entity6 " @entity1 surrendered to the @entity4 in @entity5			1
notorious for his alleged butchering of communities , including a 2008 massacre in which 150 people were killed by machetes , clubs and bullets , @entity1 will likely face trial at the @entity15 for war crimes seven years after his indictment			2
on a recent trip to eastern @entity3 , i met @entity20 , a 25 - year - old charcoal maker who had survived two attacks allegedly led by @entity1			1
four months ago , working on a hot afternoon just south of the equator in @entity26 in eastern @entity3 , it seemed like a normal day for @entity20			1
a week before , his wife had given birth to a baby boy , @entity30			2
then suddenly , @entity20 heard a " boom ! " and he ran home as quickly as he could			0
@entity20 's village had just been attacked by the @entity35 rebel group co-commanded by @entity1			0
for @entity20 , it was the second time he had been displaced in four years by an armed group led by @entity1			2
@entity38 , he arrived back home , but his wife and newborn were nowhere to be found			2
" then i heard the bombs land , and i had to flee , " he told me in the displacement camp where he now struggles to survive on one meal per day			0
months later , @entity20 had still been unable to find his family in the camps , which now include more than 2 million people			0
" my children used to crawl onto my lap , eat little candies i would buy them and make me laugh			0
now i ca n't go far to look for them , as i 'm afraid i 'll be abducted by rebels			0
i 'm told my house has been burned down			0
it 's so tough for me			0
i do n't know where they are			0
... " the terminator 's surrender has sparked jubilation in eastern @entity3 after years of suffering under his ruthless rule , during which he also amassed millions of dollars through a conflict minerals smuggling ring			1
but will this single event create lasting change for the people of eastern @entity3 who have suffered under repeated cycles of conflict for 18 years ? the answer hangs on three policy choices that must be made in the coming weeks			1
first , will war criminals be integrated back into the @entity3 's army ? the @entity35 rebel group that @entity1 co-led is full of officers with extremely poor human rights records of mass murders , child soldier recruitment and sexual violence			1
several of them are close to signing a peace deal to rejoin the @entity3 army in talks brokered by one of the rebel group 's alleged backers , @entity88			1
previous peace deals that integrated war criminals into @entity3 's army , including @entity1 , reignited conflict soon thereafter as the warlords again behaved lawlessly			1
to stop this , newly appointed @entity95 envoy @entity94 should immediately insist that any reintegration deals should be only for rank - and - file troops , not commanders most responsible for atrocities			0
to support this , the @entity15 should investigate and indict the commanders of @entity35 leaders and other armed groups most responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity , and the @entity3 justice system should prosecute other mutineers			1
second , will there be a peace process with strong international backing ? after years of failed peace agreements , there is finally a chance to address the underlying interests of @entity5 , @entity3 and @entity88 that have fueled conflict in eastern @entity3			1
this is possible now because of the strong new international pressure against external support to rebel groups , the removal of @entity1 , the lowered profitability of the trade in conflict minerals and the @entity127 's pressure on @entity3 to enact governance reforms			1
@entity129 should start negotiations that would subsume the @entity132 talks , and the @entity134 administration should follow the @entity95 lead in appointing a senior - level envoy to the peace process and ensure that regional economic integration and security issues are brought to the fore of the process			1
third , will the international community vigorously support real governance reform in @entity3 ? the @entity145 and @entity95 envoys should proactively back a root - and - branch @entity3 reform process to address critical issues that undergird the conflict , from decentralization to army reform			1
the process should include an impartially facilitated national dialogue that allows @entity3 civil society , including women leaders , to have a real voice at the table			2
when asked this year what could be done to end the war , @entity20 said , " please tell president @entity134 to arrest @entity160 , ( @entity35 commander ) @entity160 and the ringleaders			0
if they 're not arrested , they 'll continue the war , and my life will always be on the run			0
" at least one of these warlords is now in custody , but there will be no end to the war until the international community robustly backs a lasting peace and reform process that includes accountability for the worst war criminals			2
it is time to give @entity20 a chance to play with his children again and end this cyclical war once and for all			0
