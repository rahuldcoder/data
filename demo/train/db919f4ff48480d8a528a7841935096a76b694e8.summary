-- online lotteries and poker may be poised to become legal thanks to a new decision by the @entity5 reinterpreting the @entity6 of 1961			1
the decision , written in september but made public last friday , found the @entity6 's prohibition of wagers via telecommunications crossing state lines or international borders refers only to bets on a " sporting event or contest " and not to lottery tickets sold online			1
the decision does n't mention online poker , but some reason that the ruling will pave the way for online poker			2
" the @entity5 has given the online gaming community a big , big present , " prof. @entity21 wrote on his blog , @entity23			0
" if the @entity6 is limited to bets on sports events and races , what other federal anti-gambling statutes are left ? " wrote @entity26			0
" there are prohibitions on interstate lotteries , but @entity34 and the other multi-state lotteries show how easily these can be gotten around , even before @entity36 passed an express exemption for state lotteries			0
and poker is not a lottery under federal law			0
" @entity26 continued that since the @entity6 refers to bets on an event , poker would be except because poker is itself the event			1
the @entity5 has aggressively enforced the ban on online poker			1
in april , the agency shut down three foreign - based online poker firms -- @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 -- charging that each of the companies had violated the law by serving @entity58 residents			2
