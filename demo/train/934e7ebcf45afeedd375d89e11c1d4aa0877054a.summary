-- the @entity1 friday upheld former football player @entity3 's convictions for kidnapping with a deadly weapon and other charges in his 2008 @entity7 armed robbery trial , but ordered a new trial for co-defendant @entity9			1
@entity10 , 63 , is now serving a 33 - year sentence with the possibility of parole after nine years for 10 convictions relating to an armed confrontation over sports memorabilia in a @entity7 hotel room			1
@entity10 and five other men tried to regain property that @entity10 claimed was his			0
that 2008 @entity22 conviction came exactly 13 years after @entity10 was acquitted in @entity23 , @entity24 , in the murders of his ex-wife , @entity10 , and her friend @entity28			0
in his @entity22 appeal , @entity10 unsuccessfully argued that the trial court erred when prosecutors were allowed to remove two potential jurors who were african - american			2
@entity10 also alleged the trial court improperly restricted him from asking potential jurors about the notorious @entity24 murder trial and a subsequent wrongful death civil suit accusing him of causing the two deaths			0
@entity10 also contended the @entity7 trial court improperly admitted hearsay statements			0
" we conclude that all of @entity10 's arguments on appeal are without merit and we therefore affirm the judgment of conviction , " @entity22 's high court said in its ruling			1
on september 13 , 2007 , @entity10 and five men held two individuals at gunpoint and removed about $ 100,000 worth of trophies and other sports memorabilia from a @entity7 hotel room			1
" the testimony was clear and consistent : @entity10 was furious " at a third individual whom @entity10 believed had betrayed him by selling his personal items , the court wrote when addressing the assault and robbery convictions			2
" once the robbery was over and all of the items were removed from the room , @entity10 remained in the middle of the room yelling at the victims " while a conspirator held the victims at gunpoint , the justices wrote			2
of the five men who accompanied @entity10 to the @entity7 hotel room , four pleaded guilty to reduced charges in exchange for their testimony at trial , but @entity82 faced a jury verdict alongside @entity10			0
@entity9 argued that he should have received a separate trial			0
@entity9 was also convicted on 10 counts and received an identical 33 - year prison sentence as @entity10 , but the @entity1 agreed with @entity9 's attorneys and ordered a new trial			1
" we conclude that the district court did abuse its discretion when it denied the motion to sever ( @entity9 's trial from @entity10 's ) because it prejudiced @entity9 by having a substantial and injurious effect on the verdict , and we therefore reverse the judgment of conviction , " the court wrote .			1

@entity1 finds @entity10 's arguments " without merit "
a codefendant wins a new trial
@entity10 will continue a 33 - year prison sentence with a chance for parole after nine years
justices found @entity10 was " furious " when committing 2007 robbery over sports memorabilia
