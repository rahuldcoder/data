@entity1 , @entity0 -- it was @entity4 , the first day of spring and the @entity5 but was it also the beginning of a new era in @entity0 's troubled relation with its @entity5 population ? there was certainly a mood of optimism in the southeastern city of @entity13 , where hundreds of thousands assembled not just to ring in the new but to try to draw a line under the past			1
they listened to a speech written by the imprisoned @entity19 , founder of the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) , and leader of a violent insurrection that began in @entity0 in 1984			1
the crowd broke into cheers when @entity25 -- a @entity26 member of @entity27 for the @entity28 -- speaking on @entity19 's behalf , said the time had come " for the guns to be silent and to let ideas and diplomacy speak			1
" read : @entity20 calls for dialogue in @entity0 the holiday mood was in stark contrast to previous @entity4 assemblies in the 1990s which were akin to intifada with rioters throwing @entity40 cocktails and security forces firing back live rounds			1
yet for many in @entity0 , pessimism is still the default mode			2
it is one thing , as @entity19 did thursday , to call on @entity20 fighters to begin a controlled withdraw from @entity0 territory			1
what his own supporters now want to hear is what they get in return			0
the key question is whether the @entity0 government has the will and the political skill to meet a slew of @entity5 nationalist demands			0
these are almost certain to include the right to use @entity5 as an official language in government offices and in schools and also for a form of political devolution			1
they will also demand the release of the large number ( some put the figure at more than 8,000 ) of political activists now in pre-trial detention under @entity0 's sweeping anti-terror legislation			0
finally , and most problematically , the @entity20 , will demand a means of rehabilitating their own militants , including if not actual freedom , some form of house arrest for @entity19 himself			1
@entity0 has every incentive for acting now and for acting quickly			0
one of @entity0 's largest trading partners is now the @entity83 in the north of @entity85			0
@entity86 , too , is anxious to prevent the conflict in @entity88 , where @entity89 are becoming ever more autonomous , from spreading over its border			2
the long war of attrition with the @entity20 has been costly in terms of about 40,000 lives lost and an actual price tag some put at $ 1 trillion			1
a @entity0 at peace with itself could be a potent force in the decades ahead			2
yet the @entity0 prime minister , @entity99 , knows he risks alienating his own supporters if he is seen to be making too many concessions , too rapidly			0
he called the @entity4 events a " positive development " during a trip to @entity104 , but then chided the crowds for their lack of patriotism in not waving @entity0 flags			0
even so , the government will be relieved that the rally did not become a show of the @entity20 's strength			1
so , while the @entity13 meeting took the form of @entity19 addressing his supporters , there was another message to @entity0 public opinion			1
the speech evoked the great moments of nation building in the country 's history : the @entity126 battlefield of @entity127 " when @entity0 and @entity89 fell in battle shoulder to shoulder , " the @entity129 and the @entity130			2
@entity0 have long been taught @entity5 identity politics is a threat to national unity			0
if peace is to have a chance , they will have to get used to the idea			2
for the imprisoned @entity19 himself , thursday 's rally in @entity13 is just the latest step in political rehabilitation			1
he was vilified as " a baby killer " when he was captured and extradited back to @entity0 in 1999			0
however in recent months he has been the principal negotiator in the peace process			2
last november , he was instrumental in having a hunger strike called off among imprisoned detainees			0
in 1999 , i sat in a purpose - built court house on the @entity0 island of @entity148 , watching @entity19 being sentenced to death			1
his last remarks to the judge were far from contrite			0
he did not deny responsibility for leading bloody insurrection			0
instead , he said it was time to move on			0
if the government ever intended to get the @entity20 down from the mountains and bring about peace they would have to come to him			1
nearly 14 years later , his words are coming true .			0
