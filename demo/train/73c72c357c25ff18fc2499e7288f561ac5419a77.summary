-- @entity1 , the longtime deputy to @entity2 , will take over leadership of @entity4 , according to a statement posted on several jihadist websites thursday			1
the @entity7 believes that @entity1 has indeed taken the helm of the terrorist network , according to a @entity7 counterterrorism official			1
@entity1 was widely regarded as @entity4 's de facto leader since @entity7 special forces killed @entity2 at a hideout in @entity14 , @entity15 , on may 2			1
" hereby the @entity18 of the @entity4 -- and after the end of the consultations -- we declare that @entity22 dr. @entity22 ( may @entity23 bless him ) will take over the responsibility of command of the group , " the statement said , attributed to @entity4 's " general command			2
" it cited @entity2 's " martyrdom " and prayed " to the @entity28 to raise him to his heavens and reward him for his good deeds for us and the @entity33 nation			0
" @entity1 's official appointment to the terrorist group 's top post -- just a few days before his 60th birthday -- is " not surprising , " the @entity7 counterterrorism official said			1
" he had been the number two			0
it was surprising it took a couple of days for @entity4 to acknowledge @entity2 's death and this long to say @entity44 is the new leader			1
" one of the @entity47 's most wanted terrorists , @entity1 has played a defining role in @entity4			1
he was indicted for his alleged role in the august 7 , 1998 , bombings of the @entity7 @entity51 in @entity52 , @entity53 , and @entity54 , @entity55 , that killed 224 civilians and wounded more than 5,000 others , according to the @entity58 , part of the @entity7 federal government			2
the @entity47 is offering a $ 25 million reward for information leading to his capture , the same amount as the reward for @entity2			0
@entity1 's wife and three children were killed in december 2001 in a @entity7 attack on the family 's residence in @entity72			1
asked whether the @entity7 is any closer to finding @entity1 as a result of information obtained at @entity2 's compound or from leads resulting from a recent @entity1 videotaped message about @entity2 's death , the @entity7 counterterrorism official said only , " obviously , he has been and will continue to be of high interest			1
" more on @entity1 at @entity0 's @entity80 blog in a nearly half - hour video released this month , @entity1 eulogized @entity2 , saying he " went to his @entity23 martyred because he said no to @entity7			1
" @entity1 also criticized the " treacherous " @entity15 government and warned that @entity7 is " not facing individuals or groups but an entire ( @entity33 nation that ) rose from the ashes in a jihadi awakening to face its oppressors			2
" there will probably not be changes in @entity7 counterterrorism strategy now that @entity1 is leading @entity4 , the @entity7 counterterrorism official said			1
the @entity4 statement can not be authenticated by @entity0 , but it appeared on radical @entity94 sites known for posting similar statements and recruitment videos by other @entity4 figures			2
it said the group will not shift its policies and pledged its support to , among others , the @entity102 and leader @entity103 as the group battles @entity7 and @entity106 presence in @entity72			1
the posting makes no mention of the pro-democracy uprisings in much of the @entity111 world that have forced the exit of some longtime leaders			2
@entity114 , a @entity0 terrorism analyst , said @entity1 may have a hard time following @entity2			2
" @entity44 has none of the charisma of @entity2 , " @entity114 said			0
" he wants to inspire people , not just who are joining the @entity4 organization , but people who have never joined the @entity4 organization and are trying to launch attacks in their name			0
without @entity2 there anymore , they wo n't be as inspired			0
" former @entity127 officer @entity126 added @entity1 is " very poorly respected			0
" " he is seen as a difficult man to work with , " @entity126 said			0
" he has no sense among the work force in @entity4 , the kind of prestige that @entity2 had			0
" the @entity7 counterterrorism official said the @entity7 does not know whether @entity4 members have pledged their loyalty to @entity1			1
born into a wealthy family in @entity136 , @entity1 is a physician and founding member of the @entity138 , a militant organization that opposed the secular @entity140 government of @entity141 and sought its overthrow through violent means			0
like @entity2 , @entity1 also went to @entity72 during its fight against the @entity145 , although he was there primarily to offer medical expertise			0
by the 1990s , he refocused his attention on undermining and attacking the @entity140 government and , eventually , the @entity7			0
in 1998 , when the @entity138 effectively merged with @entity4 , he sent a fax to the @entity150 warning @entity7			1
three days later , august 7 , suicide truck bombers carried out the embassy attacks			0
the @entity4 statement thursday showed the group 's commitment to leading jihad efforts around the globe			1
citing @entity161 territories , @entity158 and @entity159 , the statement said @entity4 " will remain on the path of righteousness as a coherent , solid , cemented rank , with one word that will bind us together , with hearts of affinity , and under one wholesome banner , battling one enemy			2
even if the names may vary , there is no failing , no hesitation , no surrender			0
" @entity0 's @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178 contributed to this report .			0
