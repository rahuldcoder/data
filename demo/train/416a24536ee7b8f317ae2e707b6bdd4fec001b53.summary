@entity0 -- just hours after taking office , the new @entity2 reinstated a team of ethics investigators that had faced what seemed like a certain death due to lawmakers ' inaction			1
overshadowed by the recent fiscal cliff hubbub , lawmakers from the last session had neglected to decide whether or not to renew the @entity13			2
last week , @entity1 reported on the concerns among public interests groups that lawmakers were purposely trying to kill the @entity13 through their inaction to avoid future ethics investigations			1
the @entity2 on thursday night voted in new rules to reauthorize the @entity13 , and also added language that would allow members -- whose terms were set to expire -- to continue on the board			1
the @entity13 is considered to be one of the most important watchdogs in @entity0			2
it 's the only quasi-independent government body that 's sole mandate is to formally investigate members of @entity28			1
it was formed just four years ago when then - speaker @entity29 and others declared they wanted to " drain the swamp " of scandals and corruption in @entity0			2
among the biggest scandals that prompted action was that of @entity37 , a former lobbyist , who admitted in 2006 to illegally showering gifts on officials in exchange for favors			0
the probe into those allegations led to convictions or guilty pleas for 20 lobbyists and public officials -- including a member of the @entity2 and several aides to congressmen			2
other scandals included those tied to former reps			0
@entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			0
since its creation in 2008 , the @entity13 has launched more than 100 investigations of lawmakers , raising serious questions about possible congressional misdeeds			1
in about one third of its investigations , the @entity13 found that @entity2 ethics , and sometimes federal laws , were likely violated			1
those 37 cases were referred to the @entity68 for further review			0
house speaker @entity70 and @entity71 @entity29 had previously said they would reauthorize the @entity13 and appoint new members			1
but the issue was recently overshadowed by the down - to - the - wire fiscal cliff negotiations			0
in many of its hard - hitting investigations , the @entity13 has confronted legislators about their actions , raising sensitive questions about possible conflicts of interest , financial reports , missing financial information , and even questions about the legality of some lawmakers ' actions			1
there are other watchdogs for ethics within the @entity28 -- the @entity68 , and the @entity92			1
but these internal committees are often criticized for doing almost nothing because they are in the awkward position of investigating their own members and close colleagues			0
by contrast , the @entity13 is an outside body , widely seen as being objective			2
it is made up of experts , including some former members of @entity28 , who are nominated and approved by @entity70 and @entity29			1
however , the @entity13 can not take disciplinary action against the lawmakers it finds are likely to have violated ethics or federal law -- so it has to refer its most serious investigations to the @entity68			1
out of the 37 cases it received from the @entity13 , the @entity68 meted out formal punishment only on two occasions			2
supporters of the @entity13 say it has helped put a spotlight on lawmakers ' conduct			2
" the @entity13 has forced members of @entity28 to take ethics more seriously , " said @entity115 , a former federal prosecutor who now directs @entity116 ( @entity116 )			1
" it has forced the ( @entity2 ) @entity68 to act and has let all members of @entity28 know that they 're not going to be able to skate by like they have for so many years , with unethical conduct just going on			1
" but critics say it sometimes casts too wide of a net in its investigations			0
" they accept anonymous complaints made by anonymous individuals and then have the resources to conduct an investigation which can become a fishing expedition , " said rep. @entity123 , @entity124			0
rep. @entity130 , @entity132 - @entity131 said he believes there should be a way for the @entity136 public to raise issues about the conduct of their representatives in @entity0			0
but , he added , " some of what the @entity13 has sent to the @entity68 was actually really flimsy			0
i mean , conduct that if you have any idea what the real world is like , you would know was not ethically questionable or if it is , everything that happens in politics is ethically questionable			0
" and if the accusation is referred to the @entity68 , @entity130 said that 's " like torture " for lawmakers			0
" it 's like being charged with a crime , " he said			0
