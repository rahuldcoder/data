editor 's note : business insider is contributing a series of columns to @entity5 that challenge commonly held beliefs about the tech world			0
( @entity8 ) -- @entity11 's @entity10 tablet is n't just for geeks , yuppies , and rich people			1
it 's also for grandparents			2
that may not be the target audience you 're thinking of for a $ 500 piece of high - tech metal and glass			0
but it actually makes sense			0
why is that ? first and foremost , the @entity10 is incredibly simple to use , and easy to learn			1
( after more than 100 days of owning one , i love it			0
) for older people , or especially for inexperienced computer users , that 's very helpful			2
because the @entity10 is just a 10 - inch touch panel , all you need to think about and interact with is what 's on the screen			1
there are no hidden menus to have to learn about , or buttons to think about			1
there 's no need to master double - clicking or right - clicking			0
you just touch what you want			0
so while there is some learning curve for the @entity10 , it should be much easier than trying to figure out the intricacies of @entity46 or even a @entity47 and the touch - based user interface should seem very intuitive			2
there is n't anything much simpler than just touching what you want from the screen			0
second , the @entity10 is easy for the sort of stuff we imagine our grandparents would want to do with it : reading the web , e-books with large - as - you - want - it text , magazine articles , and email ; looking at photographs and videos ; filling out crossword puzzles ; and writing short messages			1
some of these apps are built in ; others can be downloaded quickly and easily from the @entity10 app store			2
the @entity10 is admittedly not very good for writing longer e-mails , but that 's where an optional wireless keyboard or keyboard dock could be helpful			1
and it 's not designed ( yet ) for printing stuff , but there are some work - arounds available , depending on what sort of printer you have , what you want to print , or if you want to go through a computer to print			0
lastly , the @entity10 is a great tool for grandparents for the same reason candy is -- their grandkids love it ! consider what my colleague @entity88 has written at @entity8 , under the title " help ! my kids are addicted to my @entity10			1
" he says , " we got an @entity10 because we thought it might provide more peace and quiet during a long trip			2
when they were n't fighting over it			0
" he adds , " a month after we bought it , the @entity10 has become so central to our household that we have to hide it			2
and in relatively short order , to preserve my family harmony , i 'm probably going to have to buy two more of the damn things			0
" so if there 's one way to be the most popular grandparents in the family , it 's by keeping an @entity10 in the living room , stocked with kids ' games , e-books , and the @entity115 app for movies and tv shows			1
( or , when it 's cheaper in a few years , an @entity10 in every room			1
) if i were a kid now , i 'd love going over to grandma and grandpa 's house to play with their @entity10 -- just as i loved going to my grandparents ' house in the ' 90s because they had cable and @entity130 , and we did n't at home			1
@entity11 's device is set to be one of the most desired gifts this holiday season			1
its mainstream appeal -- to all age groups and levels of tech - savviness , even grandparents -- is a big reason why			0
