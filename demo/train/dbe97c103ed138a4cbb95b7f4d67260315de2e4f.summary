-- a 41 - year - old @entity4 man pleaded guilty friday in federal court months after being accused of developing ricin and sending the dangerous substance in letters to president @entity9 and others , the @entity2 @entity1 announced			1
according to a plea agreement , @entity11 is expected to be sentenced to 25 years in prison			1
the @entity15 resident will be sentenced in by @entity2 district judge @entity16 in about 60 days			2
@entity0 first learned of @entity11 's plea via @entity18			2
@entity11 was arrested on april 27 , 2013 , and charged with possession and use of a biological agent as a weapon			2
the agreement wraps up a bizarre case that began when federal investigators first arrested another man -- an @entity26 named @entity27 -- for allegedly sending letters containing ricin to @entity9 , sen. @entity30 , @entity4 ; and @entity31 , a judge in @entity32			1
ricin is a deadly toxin derived from castor beans that has no known antidote			0
the letters to @entity30 and @entity9 were stopped at a government mail - screening facility after initial tests indicated the presence of the deadly poison ricin			1
the one sent to @entity31 did not cause any illness			0
@entity4 man charged in ricin case even so , the case -- which came on the heels of the @entity49 bombings -- spurred anxieties around the country about such biological attacks			1
in a way , it recalls the days after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks when @entity2 senators and journalists were sent anthrax - laced letters			0
authorities cleared @entity27 after his attorney , @entity60 , told authorities that she believed her client was framed , possibly by @entity11			1
in fact , @entity64 agents were searching @entity11 's home and the studio where he practiced martial arts as @entity27 walked out of jail			2
at the time , @entity11 told @entity0 affiliate @entity70 that he was cooperating with the @entity64 and had nothing to do with the letters			1
" i had absolutely nothing to do with those letters , " he said at the time			0
friday 's plea shows that was not true			0
the @entity1 said , in its press release friday , that @entity11 concocted and carried out the elaborate ploy -- including buying castor beans or seeds to make ricin via @entity81 -- then making the toxin and enclosing it in the three letters			1
each of the letters had a @entity88 , postmark and no return address			0
they read , in part : " to see a wrong and not expose it , is to become a silent partner to its continuance			0
" they were signed " i am @entity96 and i approve this message , " a source told @entity0			0
@entity0 's @entity98 contributed to this report .			0
