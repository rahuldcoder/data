-- @entity1 , the stop - motion animation and special - effects master whose work influenced such directors as @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 , has died , according to the @entity10 page of the @entity1 and @entity11			1
the page did not offer a cause of death			0
@entity1 's pioneering work on such movies as " @entity17 , " " @entity18 , " " @entity19 " and " @entity20 " ( 1981 ) was widely praised for its ability to blend stop - motion effects -- models filmed one frame at a time -- and live action			1
in " @entity29 , " for example , the hero has a battle with a group of skeletons that emerge from the ground and take on the @entity35 warriors			0
@entity1 called his format " dynamation , " and though it looks somewhat crude by today 's computer - generated standards , it still packs a punch -- and other filmmakers remain agog by @entity1 's abilities			1
several filmmakers paid tribute to him on his 90th birthday , including @entity7 , " @entity47 's " @entity44 and @entity46 's @entity45			1
@entity48 worked in a reference to @entity1 in " @entity50 " @entity1 was born in @entity51 in 1920			2
from his childhood he was intrigued by movies and animation , inspired by films such as " @entity56 " ( 1925 ) and especially " @entity57 " ( 1933 )			0
as a teenager he built dioramas featuring prehistoric creatures and filmed them with a 16 - millimeter camera , gently hitting the " run " button to move the film one frame at a time , according to his biography on @entity68			0
by the time he was in his early 20s he was friends with @entity70 and @entity71 , two men who shared @entity1 's fondness for storytelling and animation			1
@entity70 became a writer , editor and famed memorabilia collector ; @entity71 , of course , became one of the most celebrated science - fiction writers			0
other influential colleagues included @entity82 , the " @entity57 " animator , who encouraged @entity1 's pursuits , and @entity85 , who produced 1953 's " @entity87 " and directed 1960 's " @entity86			2
" the science - fiction and fantasy films of @entity1 's career were n't the star - filled , big - budget productions of today			2
indeed , @entity1 's creations were often the main attraction for films that lacked the polish of major studio releases			0
but the dedicated @entity1 had a well - earned following , and was quick with praise for his successors			2
he also never lost his fondness for storytelling , and even in today 's computer - dominated marketplace , maintained high hopes that the art of combining stop - motion with live action would continue			1
" stop - motion is a medium that welcomes fantasy , hence the number of recent productions , " @entity1 told @entity0 in 2012			1
" as yet , though , there seem to be no productions that are utilizing model stop - motion and live actors			1
but that will , i think , re-emerge			0
it is only a matter of time			0
