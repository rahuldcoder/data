-- @entity1 , a 93 - year - old @entity3 - @entity2 woman from @entity4 , suddenly can not vote			1
although she once marched with the rev. @entity5 for the right to do so , and has dutifully cast a ballot for five decades , in this election year she may be denied this basic right			2
under @entity11 's new voter id law , @entity1 is no longer considered eligible			1
the @entity11 law requires that citizens present a state - issued photo id card before voting , which , in @entity1 's case , required that she first produce a birth certificate			1
after much trying , and with the help of a pro bono attorney , she was finally able to obtain her birth certificate -- but on it , she is identified by her birth name @entity24 , while her other forms of identification have her as @entity1 , the name she took after adoption			0
because her 1950s adoption papers are lost in an office in @entity31 , and the state is unable to track them down , @entity1 still ca n't get a @entity11 photo id			2
she is therefore barred from voting in the november elections			2
such stringent obstacles , particularly for @entity3 , were not so long ago the accepted rule			1
despite the 15th and 19th amendments to the @entity40 , which extended the vote to black men and all women , respectively , election officials used poll taxes , literacy tests and other methods to deny this legal right			1
signed into law by president @entity50 47 years ago monday , the @entity48 empowered the federal government to oversee elections in states with racially discriminatory voting practices , and outlawed the use of literacy tests for all @entity2 voters			1
the landmark legislation not only broadened the franchise to african - americans , it opened access to poor whites and others who had also been denied their right to participate in the electoral process			1
these major social changes were hard - fought			2
without protests by citizens who willingly confronted hatred and intimidation from furious mobs , as well as assault from billy clubs and fire hoses , it 's doubtful that the @entity48 would have ever passed			2
yet as we commemorate the anniversary , we must also remember that the fight to protect our vote continues			2
across the country , efforts to suppress the turnout and registration of minority voters wage on , making that fight as urgent today as it was in the era of literacy tests and poll taxes			0
driven by nearly all @entity89 legislatures ( @entity90 , which has a @entity92 - controlled legislature , is the lone exception ) , last year 34 states introduced voter id laws with similar requirements , creating barriers for the 11 % of voting - age @entity3 who lack state - issued photo ids			1
these laws disproportionately affect minorities , the poor , senior citizens and the young			2
of the more than 21 million @entity3 without the newly required photo identification , 25 % are african - american , 15 % earn less than $ 35,000 a year , 18 % are 65 or older , and 20 % are 18 to 29			1
not so coincidentally , these groups turned out in huge numbers , largely voting @entity92 , in 2008			0
voter id laws , however , are just one arm of a systemic attempt to curb the participation of certain voters			1
in some of these same states , including @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 , legislatures have also passed laws that demand proof of citizenship to register to vote ( a tough deal if you do n't happen to walk around with a birth certificate , passport or naturalization records in your pocket ) or that reduce early voting			1
this includes the elimination of the sunday before @entity132 when many black churches hold successful " take your souls to the polls " campaigns encouraging their congregants to vote			2
still more brazen tactics , as seen in campaigns mounted in @entity141 , @entity117 and @entity142 , would summarily purge thousands of registered voters , whom state officials suspect might not be citizens , from the voter rolls			0
these measures were supposedly enacted to prevent voter fraud , but any serious examination of voter fraud reveals that there is almost none			2
a five - year investigation by the @entity154 concluded that incidents of voter fraud are exceedingly rare , and @entity11 officials have admitted that there is no in - person voter fraud in the state , not a single case that has ever been found or documented			1
rooting out such a small number of prospective fraudulent voters simply does not call for the extreme measures that shut out millions of legitimate ones			0
at best , these laws are scaring off a few tree bugs by burning down a 10th of the forest			0
the real purpose behind these restrictive voting laws is not to prevent voter fraud , but to prevent voting in the interest of partisan gain			1
@entity176 majority leader @entity175 even said as much in june , when he boasted to his @entity89 colleagues that the state 's voter id law " is going to allow governor @entity178 to win the state of @entity11			1
" no matter which side of the aisle you 're on , we can all agree that denying anyone 's vote to skew the electorate undermines our shared @entity2 values of fairness and equality			0
just like poll taxes and literacy tests before them , these laws are also keeping targeted groups of people from having a voice in their government			0
but what we can learn from these similar struggles is that social progress , such as the passage of the @entity204 , did not just happen naturally , an inevitable result of the passing years			0
it happened because citizens , activists , lawbreakers and lawmakers acted to change their society			0
but that action -- or even the mere recognition that blocking equal access to voting is a civil rights emergency -- is lacking now			0
it 's wrong to believe that these struggles ended and are reserved now for history lessons and textbooks			0
tomorrow 's history is being written today , and we can all help shape the narrative			0
in a country whose fundamental values are equality and freedom , we must always examine times when our freedoms are being violated			0
that means realizing that voter id laws such as the one blocking the vote of @entity1 are not minor bumps on the road			1
rather , they hit at the most central element of @entity2 democracy			0
as we reflect on the strides made 47 years ago , we remind our fellow citizens that each victory is taken , not given			0
and as we confront the modern - day era of voter suppression , it 's time that we all start protecting the free , fair and accessible vote that defines the greatness of our nation			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity251 and @entity252 .			0

writers : forty - seven years after @entity48 , some @entity3 newly denied vote
they say 34 states have sought voter id laws , creating barriers to 11 % of @entity3
they say voting fraud nearly *nonexistent* ; laws are partisan effort to shut out old , poor , black
writers : we must protect free , fair , accessible vote that defines greatness of our nation
