eleven years ago , @entity0 dropped off her young kids at school -- and never returned			1
not to pick them up later , and not to their @entity4 home			2
the family thought she was dead			2
that something terrible had happened to her			2
what else could explain the sudden disappearance of a woman her daughter , then 8 , later described as a " great " mom ? but then last week , after more than a decade , @entity0 turned up in @entity13 , revealing to police that she had n't been kidnapped or killed			1
she had , she said , been stressed			0
most mothers are familiar with the feeling -- for some it 's more fleeting than for others -- of total exhaustion , frustration , a sense of being overwhelmed by duty and the responsibility of raising children			1
maybe some indulge in a momentary fantasy of running away			0
though there are no hard numbers , reports would seem to indicate that the number of moms who actually do run away -- or at least walk away -- is increasing			1
according to the @entity34 , the number of single fathers has been rising steadily , from more than 600,000 in 1982 to more than 2 million in 2011			1
anecdotally , too , we 're hearing more from mothers who leave their children due to choice or circumstance			1
there 's @entity41 , who wrote in an essay for @entity43 that she realized , when her sons were 3 and 5 that she did n't want to be a full - time mother anymore			1
there are even support groups now for women who decide to leave their children			1
what is happening ? it 's hard to say , but our increasingly me - first world might have something to do with it			1
according to a study published in the journal @entity55 , clinical narcissism -- defined by heightened feelings of entitlement , decreased morality and a dog - eat - dog mentality -- has increased by 30 % over the past 20 years			2
two out of every three people now measure high for the disorder			0
in her book " @entity65 , " @entity63 argues that we live in a culture that not only tolerates , but also encourages , " being true to ourselves " and " never compromising			0
" this can extend to parenthood , as more and more mothers and fathers resist the notion that parenthood is necessarily life changing -- and perhaps not all it 's cracked up to be			2
a 2010 @entity76 story titled " all @entity77 and no fun : why parents hate parenting , " for example , cited a 2004 study by behavioral economic @entity83 that found that child care ranked 16th in pleasure out of 19 activities among the @entity89 women surveyed			0
except , of course , parenting is n't always supposed to be fun			0
whoever said it was ? mothers who abandon their children tend to be judged far more harshly by society , and by their children , than fathers who do the same -- though not because of outcome			1
according to various studies , including a 1994 report in the @entity105 , children raised in single - father homes as a whole fare as well as those in single - mother homes			1
from an emotional standpoint , there are no studies to show that children of absentee mothers are angrier than those of absentee fathers			1
but anecdotally , this seems to be the case			0
if this is true , it has to do with the fact that although stereotypical gender roles for women have changed , with more men staying home to raise the kids as mom brings home the bacon and father cooks it , societal expectations for mothers remain rooted firmly in the traditional			2
case in point : although the number of stay - at - home fathers -- about 154,000 according to the 2010 census -- is on the rise , women still carry out more of the domestic work , according to a report by @entity142			1
@entity144 culture , meanwhile , is still conditioned -- through the media and pop culture -- to believe that many women 's greatest desire is to have a baby			0
when mothers abandon their children , it 's seen as unnatural			1
could this imbalance of responsibility and expectation be another reason more women are abandoning their children ? it 's possible			2
as one married mother of two , @entity161 , told me , " my husband does n't do much			0
i have to do and plan for everything myself			0
" it 's easy to see where resentment could come in			0
the positive spin : most experts , myself included , agree that it 's better for a child to have an absent parent than a parent who 's present but neglectful -- or worse			0
and in my experience , children who come to accept the abandonment of a parent , specifically a mother , tend to be more forgiving when they believe that in doing so they were given a better life , whether that was the mother 's intent or not			2
of course , every single case is different and there are few generalizations to be made			0
@entity0 's children , for their part , want nothing to do with their mother			1
the good news is that being raised by a single parent does not condemn a child to a disadvantaged life			0
these days , the unconventional family is the norm			0
thankfully , when it comes to parenting , it 's quality over quantity .			0

after disappearing for more than a decade , @entity0 turned up in @entity13
@entity197 : reports show the number of moms who run away is on the rise
she says our increasingly me - first narcissistic tendencies might have something to do with it
@entity197 : mothers who abandon their children are still judged more harshly by society
