-- by the time he hit 327 pounds , @entity1 had been playing " the fat guy " for decades			1
his size was the thing that made him stand out			1
publicly , he embraced his lifestyle as a " bbq - lovin ' , beef - eatin ' , no - veggie - buyin ' " male who wore t - shirts flaunting his hefty size			1
there was a particularly perverse one , he says looking back on it , which read " i beat anorexia			1
" privately , he was resentful that he was n't thinner			1
he felt angry when he could n't bear to take his four little girls to the park because he was too exhausted from unloading groceries			1
he resented being told he was too big for the seat - belt latch on amusement park rides			1
his wife , @entity21 , was also obese , at 287 pounds			1
unlike @entity22 , she felt invisible			1
customers at the bank where she worked stared past her as they made their transactions			1
in late 2011 , a close family member made a comment at the dinner table that stuck with her : " she used to be something to look at			1
" in late march 2012 , the @entity32 couple had an emotional conversation			1
@entity34 was coming up on her 30th birthday and was sick of the way she looked and felt			1
they had had talks like this before , where they talked about needing to change , but something was different that night			1
" i adore my kids and i love my husband very much , but there was that point i hated myself so much			1
i was n't giving them the full me because i was disgusted , " @entity34 said			1
" you have to look in the mirror and say , ' am i going to allow this to continue or am i going to stand up and make those changes ? ' a light turned on upstairs			1
" the next week , she began taking @entity56 classes			1
in just a few weeks , she had lost 14 pounds -- enough to motivate her to take on new physical challenges			1
she moved on to bikes and treadmills and made sure to sweat for an hour at least three times a week			1
after that , there was no turning back , she said			2
@entity22 was a little slower to change -- the thought of going for a run was " unappealing to the point of agony " -- but he started playing tennis and stopped taking seconds at dinner			2
in the summer of 2012 , they added other physical activities that did n't feel like working out , like hiking and recreational swimming with their kids and friends			2
they got hooked on the physical highs and wanted to do more			2
@entity22 joined @entity34 in training for a 5 - kilometer race that december			2
he walked as much as he ran , and @entity34 finished way ahead of him			2
but something in him changed			2
" the race environment and the high fives and the feeling of accomplishment became addicting to me , " he said			2
" after that day , i swore i would work to run a 5k without slowing to a walk			2
" in @entity22 's words , " it got crazy from there			2
" the more he ran , the more he felt he needed to run			2
when he put on his sneakers and took off , " i felt like my whole life was skyrocketing upward , " he said			2
a few months after that first 5k , he ran his second , this time without walking			0
then he did his first 10 - mile run			0
and in may 2014 , he ran his first marathon			0
by then he was 160 pounds lighter			1
throughout the process , the couple used a calorie - counting app to keep track of everything they ate			0
they knew they wanted to break their family 's cycle of unhealthy relationships with food while their children were still young			0
" it got to the point where we realized it did n't matter what we fed them , " @entity22 said			0
" if we were n't eating the same way or if we were overeating , they were going to follow our example			0
" the @entity121 began shopping only the periphery of grocery stores , never entering the aisles unless it was for cereal			0
they added more fruits , vegetables and lean white meats and fish			0
they also began cooking everything they ate from scratch , including breads , dressings and sauces			0
" our whole philosophy towards food was adding good things , " @entity22 said			0
" what we found was , the more and more good things we added , the less we craved the garbage			0
" after months of a diet rich in whole grains , green vegetables and lean meats , they recently made the decision to go vegan for health , environmental and ethical reasons			0
@entity22 and @entity34 now each weigh 167 pounds , down a collective 280 pounds			1
@entity21 has lost 120 pounds from the start of their journey ; @entity22 has lost 160			1
they feel healthier , happier and ready to tackle the world			0
@entity22 , a former bank branch manager , has gone back to college to pursue a bachelor 's degree in integrative physiology with the goal of entering medical school			0
this may , he completed his first year of college			0
he 's not " the fat guy " anymore , and he 's fine with that			0
@entity34 feels pretty great , too			0
now a size 10 , down from size 24 , she 's still getting used to people paying attention to her			0
she re-entered the workforce in july 2013 after five years as a stay - at - home mom and was surprised at the difference in how people treated her			1
" a lot of people became very friendly and were really looking at me in my face , instead of this blank stare			0
... and obviously , the opposite sex was more playful , always complimentary			0
never , ever , ever , " she said			0
i like what i 'm seeing in the mirror			0
i know there 's some work to still be done , but i 'm such a different person than i was before			0
