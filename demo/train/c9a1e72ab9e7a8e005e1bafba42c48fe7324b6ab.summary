-- on my last day on a visit to @entity3 , @entity4 , i participated in a long conversation with a @entity7 political leader			1
i agreed that the conversation would be off the record , but without direct quotation , i can summarize what was said			0
the peace process between @entity12 and the @entity13 is dead , in the view of @entity7			1
likewise , economic growth in the @entity16 is illusory , a product only of @entity19 aid			0
the @entity20 are divided , and the international community has lost interest in us			1
that might sound like a negative assessment			0
yet my @entity7 interlocutor insisted that today 's desperate outlook would soon yield to tomorrow 's glorious victory			2
with the peace process dead , the @entity13 would break apart			1
@entity16 palestinians would realign themselves with @entity7			2
those who refused would be eliminated as collaborators			0
the @entity7 man did tacitly acknowledge that @entity13 attacks on @entity12 have failed in the past			1
he declined to agree that the 2000 - 2003 intifada was a failure or that @entity7 had been defeated in the december 2008 @entity38 war			1
but he did not argue that these wars were successes either			0
but next time , things would be different , the " resistance " would be global : @entity7 , he suggested , would call @entity44 around the world to join the fight against @entity12 , just as @entity44 worldwide joined together in @entity47 in the 1980s to fight the @entity48			1
this next fight -- he said -- would force @entity12 to rethink its continued existence			2
he said that just as his generation was more radical than his father 's , so the next generation would be more radical than his own			0
the @entity7 man asked with sinister humor : " if you @entity58 care so much about the @entity12 , why do n't you give them @entity59 ? " the tone was defiant , belligerent , confident			1
yet through it all , i also heard a despairing undertone			0
the @entity7 man lamented that nobody understands @entity7			2
those who try to talk to them -- like @entity58 president @entity66 -- end up paying a heavy political price			0
he veered from boasting that they would never negotiate with the @entity12 to complaining that @entity12 had ignored their offer of a truce in 2004			2
he claimed the flotilla organizers who tried to bring aid to @entity7 - controlled @entity38 had achieved a great success -- then later complained that nothing had changed , that @entity12 controlled the flow of goods into @entity38 as tightly as ever			1
the plan seemed to be : for @entity7 and the radical @entity20 to suffer defeat after defeat until finally @entity12 collapsed			1
that does not sound like a very good plan			0
earlier on the trip , another @entity7 representative had explained this point of view very succinctly : " to emerge from the fight with your steadfastness undiminished : that is victory			2
" but actually ... no it 's not victory			0
fighting and losing , followed by more fighting and more losing is a formula for prolonging the pain of defeat			0
@entity7 promises its supporters a far - off day of apocalyptic retribution and redemption			1
if my source is right , there will be another outburst of violence soon			0
almost certainly it will end the way the previous rounds of violence have ended			0
@entity12 will be left standing more strong and secure and prosperous than ever - and its attackers will be more frozen in their refusal to do the thing most necessary to end this conflict : recognize @entity12 , reject war , and make the best deal they can get based on today 's realities			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity119 .			2

@entity119 : @entity7 political leader expects peace process to fail
@entity119 says @entity7 expects next conflict with @entity12 will *attract* broader support
@entity7 ' policy is self - defeating , wo n't change @entity129 reality , says @entity119
he says @entity20 should recognize @entity12 , make best deal they can
