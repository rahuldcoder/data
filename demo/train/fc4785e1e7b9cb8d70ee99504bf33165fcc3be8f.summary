-- the voice from the top of @entity3 is ominous : " @entity4 is good -- but will she ever be in a position to show how good she is ? " mused @entity3 's supreme leader @entity6 in march			1
" for any team boss deciding whether to give a shot to a female driver , the evidence is clear			1
in the 50 years since a woman first stepped behind the wheel of an @entity3 car , the sum total of their achievements is half a championship point			1
surely , say @entity3 's top men , there 's a reason why a woman ca n't race with the boys			1
@entity4 , a development driver for the @entity25 team who is hoping to become the elite motorsport 's first female competitor in 20 years , has always been told why she wo n't make it			1
from fragile necks to lack of grit , team bosses and @entity3 luminaries have lined up to give their two cents about the female frailties that have prevented a woman driver from making the breakthrough into regular racing action			1
@entity39 , the last to enter the championship in 1992 , did not start a race			0
@entity42 had seemed set to become the next , but suffered serious injuries in a crash during her first testing session for the @entity47 team in 2012 , and she died just 15 months later			0
two years after the @entity50 's crash , all eyes will be on @entity4 when she takes part in practice sessions at the @entity54 and @entity55 grands prix in july for the @entity25 team			1
the big question is , can a woman ever beat the boys at their own game ? ' she does n't have the strength ' " i know that women have around 30 % less muscle than men , " says @entity4			1
" and it was always one of the big reasons people said to me that i would n't be successful in @entity3 -- because i simply would n't be strong enough			1
" former f1 chief doctor @entity67 had a first - hand taste of the physical demands -- and neck - breaking sustained @entity72 cornering forces -- while being taken for five laps in @entity75 's two - seater @entity3 car			1
" i thought : if we were doing six laps , i 'd have to press the button that tells them ' i do n't want to do this anymore ! ' because my neck hurt so bad , " he recalls			0
any driver , male or female , will need to undergo a grueling course of training to bulk up on core and upper body strength if they are to stand a chance of fighting for grand prix podiums			1
but after all that , wo n't women still trail behind the men ? " in terms of strength : no. forget it			2
there 's no hindrance there , " @entity67 says			1
" that level of core and upper body strength is available to any woman that is prepared to put in the time			2
" it 's not something you need to tell @entity4			1
she says any doubts she had before her 89 - lap test session at @entity110 last year faded fast			0
" already on my first lap out of the pits i knew it was going to be manageable , " she says			0
" i think we are at a slight disadvantage in terms of physical strength but it 's something that can be overcome and it 's something that wo n't stop us being successful in @entity3			1
" ' she wo n't be able to handle the pressure ' when 84 - year - old racing legend @entity121 aired his thoughts about " ladies " driving in @entity3 , he had no doubts that they could achieve the strength			1
he only worried they lacked the concentration , focus and " mental aptitude " to " race hard , wheel - to - wheel " with the top men			2
@entity4 's response was to " cringe			1
" for her -- and many other observers -- the comments seemed typical of the offhand chauvinism which she has brushed aside on her way to the top levels of the sport			0
" i think we 're in a different generation , " she courteously put it			0
but new evidence suggests not all stereotypes about the gender 's mental makeup are without justification			0
@entity67 considers the common one : that women are more maternal and men are more aggressive			2
" i would have laughed about that a few years ago , " he says			0
" but i think science is beginning to realize that the human brain and human behavior is dramatically affected by sex			0
" there are behaviors that you can look at cross-culturally ... in general , men are more reckless more brazen , more risk - taking			0
" these gender - based differences in the brain could , in theory , he says , have an impact on those character traits that are necessary to succeed in motorsport , and to succeed on the track in any given race			0
but there is nothing to say any individual female driver will not match the aggression levels of even the most hot - headed male drivers , @entity67 says -- or indeed that calmer strategies will not ultimately prevail			1
and to put this unknown in context of the things we do know : when it comes to maintaining super-human levels of focus and concentration , female drivers have got all that it takes to challenge in @entity3 , he insists			2
@entity67 contends that this , too , has a basis in the physical and we can say from tests in marathon performance -- as a marker of aerobic conditioning -- that the best women are as good as the best men			1
for @entity4 , all the talk of aerobic conditioning and gender based differences is just academic			2
" i 'm incredibly lucky to be in a sport where when i put a helmet on and am out on the track , it does n't matter what my gender is , all that matters is my performance -- and that 's what it always comes down to in sport actually , your performance , " the 31 - year - old says			0
' she 'll never get the cash ' but for @entity6 , there 's more to it than that			0
inevitably , there 's also the question of money			0
" the big problem with a woman , even if she 's good enough , is having the opportunity to show that , " @entity6 said in an interview with the @entity223			0
" because a team wo n't take a woman driver unless they bring them massive sponsorship			0
" with all the positive publicity that has surrounded @entity4 's rise and rise , you 'd think that advertisers would be falling over themselves to be associated with her			2
" generally speaking , women in sport are certainly an attractive proposition for sponsors as they are often seen as more likeable and trusted , compared to their male counterparts , " agrees @entity237 , senior vice-president of motorsport at market research company @entity239			0
but consider @entity25 ' chief sponsor martini : would its advertising -- heavy on retro " @entity248 " - style imagery and male seduction fantasies -- make sense with a no - nonsense female driver behind the wheel ? @entity237 talks about " new examples of sponsorship activation " -- new , less macho brands becoming involved with the sport 's female drivers			1
but , there 's a catch : " drivers must first convince investors that they are capable of vying for the points during the @entity3 season , " he says			2
understandably , no brand wants their name to be seen on the side of a last - place car -- but this is a promise that can rarely be given , even when a prospective competitor has cleaned up in other race categories			0
add to that the sport 's danger -- made clear by the tragic crash suffered by @entity278 , once the most visible female face of @entity3 , before her death last year -- and here the inevitable boon of publicity works against a trailblazing woman driver			1
if everyone 's watching you , no - one will miss you pulling in last , or getting hurt			0
whether @entity4 is the woman to show that female drivers really can be banked on , no - one wants to guess			2
but she is happy to show patience and wait for a chance to come her way : " there 's no pushing women in to get the quota higher , it 's simply happening in an organic way , " says the @entity291 -- who is married to @entity292 , executive director at the dominant @entity3 team this season , @entity295 , and a shareholder at @entity25			1
" i think what it takes now is for women to be on the grid , racing			0
little girls will be inspired by that and get racing , then you get the best girls rising to the top , and that 's when you get future champions			0
" follow the latest action with @entity0 's essential @entity3 guide			2
