@entity0 and allied airstrikes in @entity2 and @entity3 are changing the battlefield below			1
the @entity5 sees progress , even if it 's a slog			0
but there may be unintended consequences of the air campaign -- in a way that will give the @entity12 yet another headache			0
the two most powerful @entity15 groups in @entity3 -- the @entity16 in @entity2 and @entity3 ( @entity17 ) and @entity19 affiliate @entity18 -- have spent much of the last year killing each other			1
but in an interview with @entity23 , a senior @entity18 commander says the two groups now have a common enemy : the " crusaders ' coalition			1
" @entity28 , an @entity18 commander in @entity29 , said in a @entity31 interview : " we ca n't fight on the crusaders ' side against a @entity35			1
@entity36 said in the @entity37 that ' those who support them become one of them			0
' " two groups , whose bitter split was a windfall for other rebel groups and for the @entity12 , may be making up			0
@entity18 leader @entity46 -- in a rare public declaration -- has described the airstrikes as an assault on @entity50 , and warned the @entity12 public : " this is what will take the battle to the heart of your land , for the @entity35 will not stand as spectators watching their sons bombed and killed in their lands , while you stay safe in your lands			1
" were @entity17 and @entity18 to call a truce or even unite under one banner in the face of @entity0 bombardment , the balance of power among rebel groups in @entity3 would change radically			1
a militant @entity15 coalition would likely overwhelm more moderate rebel groups -- and pose a greater threat to the regime of @entity3 president @entity72			1
against a background of mistrust and brutality , a formal @entity74 alliance does not seem on the table -- but if @entity28 is correct , more " local understandings " against @entity3 regime forces are likely			0
asked about a recent statement by @entity17 that it would soon extend its presence in southern @entity3 ( the northern provinces of @entity84 and @entity85 are its strongholds ) , @entity28 welcomed the declaration			1
" we support any group that raises the flag of @entity36 and his @entity91 and fights the infidel @entity92 , and there is coordination in @entity95 [ an area on the @entity3 - @entity97 border ] , " he said			2
@entity98 has seen heavy clashes between @entity15 rebel groups and @entity3 regime militia , supported by the @entity97 @entity103 militia @entity102			1
reports from the area sunday spoke of high casualties as @entity18 and @entity17 joined forces against @entity102			1
" there is mutual understanding between us and the brothers in the @entity16 not to fight each other and fight the @entity113 [ @entity72 ] regime , " @entity28 added			0
@entity17 appears to have reciprocated			0
it says it has released from jails in @entity84 many of the @entity18 commanders and fighters it captured during fighting between the groups			2
anger over strikes on @entity18 @entity0 officials said the targets in the first strikes on @entity3 last month included buildings west of @entity29 belonging to a group called @entity127 , an offshoot of @entity18 focused on attacking the @entity12			1
but at least one senior @entity18 commander , @entity129 , was reported killed in those strikes in the town of @entity132			2
documents later found in the rubble by @entity135 , a respected reporter for @entity137 - based network @entity136 , suggest that an elite group inside @entity18 known as the @entity139 had been hit			2
@entity135 posted photographs of documents with the names of 13 foreign fighters who belonged to the @entity139 , including @entity129			0
@entity23 can not verify the documents			0
but @entity28 suggested there was no difference between " the brothers in @entity127 " and @entity18 , saying " they are not a separate organization			0
everyone in @entity18 in @entity3 follows the @entity19 organization			1
" whatever debate there may be over the name of the unit targeted , and who was killed , the strikes appear to have hardened the resolve of @entity18			0
in his audio message , released five days after the @entity0 strikes , @entity46 said : " do not let the @entity12 and @entity0 take advantage of the injustice of the @entity16 upon you ... those who are unable to repulse the @entity16 or others , then let them do so without being a partner with the crusader alliance			0
" in other words : however bad isis are , do n't take sides with the @entity12			0
@entity170 stopped short of holding out an olive branch to @entity17			0
the only way @entity18 could formally join @entity17 is by pledging allegiance to @entity17 leader @entity174 , thereby declaring its own extinction			1
@entity18 leaders will also be aware that if @entity12 strikes severely degrade @entity17 , @entity18 could fill the void			1
the acid test will be what happens at local level			0
the @entity3 observatory of @entity183 reports that a few dozen @entity18 fighters joined @entity17 in the @entity29 area after @entity0 airstrikes began			1
further targeting of @entity18 facilities by @entity0 strikes might hasten that process			1
also critical in coming weeks will be the relationship between @entity18 and more moderate rebel groups			2
a recent analysis from the @entity194 ( @entity194 ) concluded that @entity18 " overcame initial unpopularity among mainstream activists and militants to earn broad acceptance as an authentic , @entity3 component of the uprising			1
" in the words of one secular rebel , quoted by the @entity194 , " everyone cooperates with @entity18 to some extent ; sometimes you need them to come in and blow something up			0
" but @entity46 warned @entity18 will fight any group that takes @entity0 cash and weapons , condemning " the traitorous factions that were bought by the @entity12 with some money and ammunition so as to be a pawn in its hands ... " according to a translation by @entity217			1
@entity218 , the @entity18 commander in @entity29 , echoed that line , telling @entity23 : " those who seek glory without @entity36 's support will be humiliated			2
and if it was proved that the brothers in the @entity225 and other @entity226 have taken weapons form @entity0 , then we can not work with them			0
@entity0 is the one who fought @entity50 and @entity35 everywhere			1
" the problem is these groups need @entity18 's help against both isis and the regime -- but they also need @entity234 's money , training and weapons to survive			2
some are angry that @entity0 bombs have fallen on @entity18 rather than the bases and troops of the @entity72 regime ; it just makes their job more difficult			1
the outcome may be some form of " do n't ask , do n't tell , " whereby some rebel groups will get @entity0 help but continue to co-operate and even share resources with @entity18			1
that is not to suggest mutual trust ; groups like the @entity251 are wary of @entity18 's goal of an @entity50 state in @entity3 and of its more aggressive approach to other factions in recent months			1
but they are incapable of taking on @entity18 , @entity17 and the @entity72 regime ; it would be tactical suicide			2
the anatomy of @entity17 : how the ' @entity16 ' is run the view from head office the evolving @entity3 battle lines will be closely monitored by @entity264 and @entity19 's senior leadership in the @entity268 - @entity267 border area			1
they will want @entity18 to hold the line against @entity17 , rather than ride to the rescue of a prodigal son			2
@entity264 was both humiliated and eclipsed by @entity17 ' defiance of @entity19 , appalled by its nihilistic violence and outraged by @entity276 's impudence in declaring himself ' @entity278			2
' just two days before @entity46 's message was released , an @entity19 spokesman reiterated the party line			0
in a 15 - minute taped speech , @entity282 managed to avoid mentioning @entity17 , but the message was unmistakable			2
the @entity17 caliphate , he said , was illegitimate			0
" we call to restore the rightly - guided caliphate on the prophetic method , and not on the method of deviation , lying , breaking promises , and abrogating allegiances , " @entity282 declared , according to a translation by @entity217			0
and he condemned " people of extremism , ignorance , and excessiveness , who infidel - brand the worshipers , kill the monotheists , sow corruption in jihad " -- barely disguised code for @entity17			2
the theme is repeated ; there will be no accommodation with " those who helped ignite sedition			0
" so it would be a severe blow to @entity19 if @entity18 were to fold itself into @entity17			1
counterterrorism analysts argue about whether the tail is wagging the dog : whether @entity264 is trying breathlessly to keep up with myriad groups adopting the @entity19 moniker , or actually shaping their activities			0
fbi director @entity317 said recently : " there is not a highly capable , functioning @entity320 [ @entity19 senior leadership ] " in the @entity268 - @entity267 area			0
@entity127 -- in his estimation -- was another example of the affiliates overshadowing the leadership thanks to " refugees from @entity268 and @entity267			0
" the worst outcome for @entity264 and @entity19 's senior leadership would be for @entity17 to survive and defy an extensive campaign to destroy it , and instead to hold or even take more territory			2
its intent is to do just that , believing attack is the best form of defense			0
within the past two weeks , it has captured scores of @entity338 villages in northeastern @entity3 , laid siege to the town of @entity341 , stepped up the pressure in the @entity29 countryside and evicted the @entity2 army from several bases in @entity347 province			0
@entity17 ' ability to withstand @entity0 and allied strikes and to hold its ground will be decisive in shaping the attitudes of other rebel groups -- including @entity18 -- as well as @entity19 central and the @entity72 regime .			1

the two most powerful @entity15 groups in @entity3 have spent months killing each other
now , @entity0 and allied airstrikes could have an unintended consequence
@entity17 and @entity19 affiliate @entity18 could find a common enemy : the @entity0 - led allied effort
" we ca n't fight on the crusaders ' side against a @entity35 . " says an @entity370 commander
