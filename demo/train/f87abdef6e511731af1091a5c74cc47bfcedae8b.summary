-- mention @entity2 's " homeland " to just about anyone and two things will happen			1
one , they 'll tell you they watch it religiously and two , they wo n't stop talking about it to you in painstaking detail			1
to say the show has a cult following is an understatement			2
the series has over 2 million viewers weekly , won four emmy awards this year and received seven @entity19 just days ago , including @entity20 , best actress in a @entity22 , best actor in a @entity22 and @entity24 , mini-series , or @entity26			2
the creator of " homeland " and former co-executive producer of " 24 , " is @entity30			1
before the season 2 finale airs on sunday , december 16 , @entity0 caught up with @entity30 to talk about the writing process , the " snl " spoof and the long wait for season 3			1
@entity0 : you wrote the season finale with @entity39 -- what is it like in the writers ' room ? @entity30 : we sit around in a room and there is some fun in concocting some stories because we only have to do 12 episodes			1
the load is less than , for example , " 24 " so you have an opportunity to really focus and to try and really make them better because you are only doing half as much			2
@entity0 : how long does it take to write one episode ? @entity56 : the episodes take different amounts of time			2
some are a real bear and they are difficult to break in the story room and they are difficult to idealize on the page and they go through many incarnations			2
while other episodes just come more easily , where the story lays out in a more cohesive way sooner and they do n't take that long			2
we obviously have time constraints			2
these things have to get done and they have to get in front of the camera , but in general a story will take about two weeks to break in the story room			2
and it will take roughly three weeks to write a first draft and then will take about a month after that to really hone into a script that we can put in front of the camera			0
@entity0 : it looks like someone dies in the season finale -- what can you tell us about it ? @entity56 : rather than corroborate or dismiss any rumors out there , i just encourage people to watch the last installment of the season this year			1
people have been spoiling episodes and sometimes they are correct but most often they are not			1
@entity0 : did you see the " homeland " sketch on " @entity100 ? " @entity56 : ( laughs ) i did ! everybody here just thought it was hysterical			0
first of all , to be on " snl " means that we are in the national conversation and so it 's an honor			0
people are watching the show and talking about it and talking about @entity111 ( @entity112 ) and @entity113 ( @entity114 ) and @entity117 's ( @entity116 ) performance and therefore it 's easily parodied			0
but that is just a compliment to what they are doing and i thought they were brilliant			0
i thought the people that portrayed them were just hysterical and i know that @entity127 and @entity111 are friends so it was fun			0
@entity0 : why do you think people are so addicted to " @entity101 ? " @entity56 : that is a very difficult question to answer and it 's a question that we are asked all the time			1
i do n't think you can narrow it down to one thing except to say that the show is greater than the sum of its parts			0
it 's one of those amazing instances where everything seems to come together -- the writing and acting and the directing all complement each other and make each other better			1
but if i did have to narrow it down to one detail or one element , i would say that it is the chemistry between @entity152 and @entity114 on camera			0
there is something compelling about watching these two damaged people fall in love with each other			0
@entity0 : who would be your dream guest star ? @entity56 : we kind of already have that dream person			0
we all loved @entity163 here and he seems like a perfect character for this clandestine world and a really good antagonist for @entity117 's character @entity169			0
so , we already have our dream person in the cast			0
@entity0 : have you gotten any negative feedback or heard from people that did n't like the show ? @entity56 : you know , we existed in this anonymous little bubble last year for the majority of the season and the show gained an audience and critical acclaim as we went forward			1
we were just all so shocked and surprised that we won the @entity184 so i think there was a bit of a target on our back this year			0
people were worried whether we were going to live up to the first season			1
there are some people who do n't think the second season is as good as the first			1
i , frankly , do n't agree with them			0
i 'm in the middle of it right now and it 's hard to be objective so when this season is over we are going to take a long look at what we did and decide for ourselves			1
@entity0 : what can we expect in @entity203 ? and since people will be going through withdrawals after the finale , when is season three going to air ? @entity56 : everyone is going to have to watch the season finale before i start talking the particulars of season 3 in terms of the narratives and the story , but we will begin filming season 3 sometime in the third week of may and the show will air in the last week of september 2013			1
everyone is going to have to just take a chill pill during our time away .			0
