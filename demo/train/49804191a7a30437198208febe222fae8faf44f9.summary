-- it 's clear that we ca n't go 24 hours without @entity3 saying something so stupid that it defies logic , but leave it to the @entity7 of politics to find something wrong with first lady @entity11 's effort to curb obesity in @entity14 's kids			1
in a radio interview on wednesday with conservative talker @entity16 , @entity3 took dead aim at the first lady 's " @entity23 " initiative , which is all about getting children active and involved in exercise and healthy eating			1
in the wacky world of @entity25 's finest , @entity3 tries to cast the effort to fight obesity as part of @entity11 's " different worldview			1
" here is a portion of the transcript from @entity33 : " take her anti-obesity thing that she is on			2
she is on this kick , right			0
what she is telling us is she can not trust parents to make decisions for their own children , for their own families in what we should eat			0
" and i know i 'm going to be again criticized for bringing this up , but instead of a government thinking that they need to take over and make decisions for us according to some politician or politician 's wife priorities , just leave us alone , get off our back and allow us as individuals to exercise our own @entity52 - given rights to make our own decisions and then our country gets back on the right track			2
" @entity23 " is @entity11 's " kick ? " maybe someone should kick @entity3 so she can understand how devastating obesity is to the future of the @entity14			1
according to the first lady 's " @entity23 " website : obesity rates among children have tripled in the last three decades , and one in three children are obese			1
one - third of all children born after 2000 will suffer from diabetes			2
children are less active today than at any other time in @entity14 history , spending 7.5 hours a day watching tv , playing video games or simply involved in efforts that do n't require movement			0
obesity is contributing to the vast increase in hypertension among @entity14			2
now , since @entity3 is always talking about our nation 's military and how we have to honor them and show them love and affection , let 's listen to what a group of generals said a few months ago about obesity and @entity14 's national defense			1
a study released in april by @entity91 : @entity92 , a nonprofit group of more than 150 retired generals and admirals , concluded that 27 percent of 18 - to 24 - year - olds are too fat to join the military			1
the culprit ? junk food and too much fat in school lunches			0
said the study : " today , otherwise excellent recruiting prospects , some of them with generations of sterling military service in their family history , are being turned away because they are just too overweight			0
our standards are high because we clearly can not have people in our command who are not up to the job			0
too many lives depend on it			0
" in testimony before @entity117 , the former head of the @entity119 , retired @entity121 major gen. @entity120 , said that " 80 percent of children who were overweight between the ages of 10 to 15 were obese by age 25			1
" he and other military leaders want @entity117 to enact a massive child nutrition bill to remove all junk food and high - calorie beverages from schools , improve nutrition standards in schools , upgrade school menus and , the group said , " help develop new school - based strategies , based on research , that help parents and children adopt healthier lifelong eating and exercise habits			1
" @entity120 testified : " in 1946 , @entity117 passed the @entity141 as a matter of national security			1
in the past , retired admirals and generals have stood up to make it clear that @entity14 is only as healthy as our nation 's children			1
childhood obesity is now undermining our national security and we need to start turning it around today			0
" so , @entity3 , are you going to also rip into this decorated @entity14 and say that he and 150 other military leaders are dead wrong ? i recently sat down with @entity11 for a prime time special on @entity158 cable network dedicated to her " @entity23 " initiative			1
it was startling to listen to her talk about the horrible statistics and the shape we 'll be in in the future , figuratively and literally			0
" the crisis that we 're facing around childhood obesity hits everything , " @entity11 said			1
" it 's about education , what our kids are learning about nutrition in the schools , the quality of the food in the schools			2
it 's about our neighborhood development			0
how are neighborhoods designed ? " are our kids -- do they have access to safe places to play ? are we structuring communities in a way that facilitates healthy living ? are there accessible and affordable healthy foods in our communities ? and it 's about economic opportunity as well , because if folks ca n't afford to put food on the table , then they 're eating what they can			2
" so this is one of those issues that requires us to talk about a little bit of everything			0
and it makes us look at ourselves a little more closely and it makes us look at the broader society			0
so we 're beginning to understand this is a threat			0
" this latest broadside by @entity3 shows how reckless and ridiculous she is			1
libertarians and far right conservative republicans are always talking about government intrusion into our lives , but when we look at clean water , air quality and food supply , thank @entity52 for governmental standards			0
do n't think for a second i 'm not paying attention			0
i 've increased my health awareness , am changing my diet and working out more to lose weight , and am pushing family members to do the same			0
that 's really the whole point of @entity11 's " @entity23			1
" any @entity225 with common sense should see that @entity3 poses an immediate threat to the future of this country			2
she proves that every time she opens her mouth			0
@entity3 , for the benefit of the nation , stick a fork in it			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity238 .			2

@entity238 says @entity3 *slammed* @entity11 's " @entity23 " anti-obesity campaign
he says @entity11 's site says obesity tripled in *30* years , diabetes in kids is up
he says a group of generals told @entity117 increasingly people are too overweight to serve
@entity238 : @entity3 's comments show she is reckless about the nation 's health
