-- when @entity2 set out to create a @entity4 motion sensor that had the strength to resist the stress of rough and tumble yet the smarts to detect human movement , it would have been easy to look for answers in academic papers and the latest scientific theories			0
instead , the @entity13 nuclear - physicist - come - microelectronic - specialist cast conventional wisdom aside and sought inspiration in the architectural splendor of the @entity18 city of @entity19			1
it was here , in early 2003 , that @entity22 came to wonder at the towering @entity23 -- a 58 - meter - tall wooden structure that has remained unmoved for more than 1,200 years despite being situated in an active earthquake zone			1

" there 's a single pillar ( in the @entity23 ) and then it is like a flower with different levels of floors , " @entity2 explained			1
" when there is an earthquake ... structure ( s ) like this do n't go down because you have only one pillar			1
usually if you have two pillars , because of movement in the earth , then you may have some breakage			0
" instead of making ( the sensor devices ) like we were at the time with a lot of pillars ... we found a way to make a single pillar structure to make it more robust			2
" @entity22 's observation led to a flurry of excited development at his company , @entity64 , in @entity66 , @entity13 , upon his return from @entity18			1
just five weeks later and the first micro-electrical mechanical sensor ( @entity69 ) device with @entity22 's single - pillar theory was validated by his colleagues			2
@entity69 were not a new invention at the time but using this off - beat technique to make the tiny silicon components more resilient whilst maintaining performance was a major breakthrough			2
after many years of research " we had the industrial solution from a performance point of view , form a cost point of view ( and ) from a quality point of view to realize our business idea , " @entity22 enthused			0

the @entity18 gaming giant used the devices to detect and interact with user movement in the control pads of its @entity96 ( which subsequently became one of the most popular computer consoles of all time )			1
versions of @entity22 's @entity69 chips have since been applied to desktop computers and are now an integral feature of smartphone and tablet devices			1
@entity69 is the component responsible for enabling users to flick between apps , tilt their smartphones to engender movement in a game they may be playing as well as stabilizing camera images when pictures are taken			1
without @entity22 's eureka moment , it can safely be concluded that cellphone technology would be nowhere near as advanced as it is today			0
" sometimes i think about this and i am glad to see that what i started ( has been useful ) and i like when i hear people , especially in the crisis times , saying thanks to @entity69 we have a job , " @entity2 said			2

the technology has already ballooned into a billion dollar industry with 18 million sensors now produced every week ( of which @entity64 are responsible for around 60 % )			0
he highlights a strew of potential new uses , including indoor mapping , healthcare devices that measure movement over a certain period as well as a exciting new smartphone applications			2
" today there are many applications using @entity69 , " @entity2 said			0
" if you go on the internet you are looking at about tens of thousands of applications			0
" " this ( field ) is a place where big companies , but also start - ups , can think about new applications and make it happen , " he added .			0

an ancient @entity18 *temple* inspired an @entity13 inventor to create a piece of technology vital for smartphones
the @entity23 in @entity19 has stood in the same place for more than 1,200 years despite being situated in an earthquake zone
the architectural underpinnings of the structure acted as inspiration for a new type of micro-processor
@entity69 technology is now a vital component in smartphone and tablet devices
