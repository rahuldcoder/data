in an otherwise smart suburb of @entity1 is a small prison housing some of the women @entity4 society would rather forget			1
some of the 70 inmates of @entity7 are accused or convicted of murdering their husbands , others of drug trafficking			0
many of the women have themselves been victims of circumstance all their lives and are now for the first time discovering they have a voice , according to @entity17 , an actress and drama therapist working with the inmates			1
several times a week for the past six months , @entity17 has spent an afternoon with the women encouraging them to talk about their experiences			1
in february or march , the project will culminate in a performance called " @entity23 in @entity7 , " named after the fictional @entity25 @entity24 and narrator of " @entity27 , " and based around the women 's own stories			1
among the 20 prisoners involved is @entity31 , now 26 , and awaiting trial for a murder she denies			2
in video footage of the project , @entity31 said : " i never learned to say no. i was always obedient , saying yes to my very early marriage , saying yes to my parents who forbid me to get divorce			2
now i 'm learning that i have a voice and it can spell no. " @entity41 's accidental child victims @entity17 , who has a weekly political satire show on @entity4 television and also runs a drama therapy center @entity45 , said the project -- funded by the @entity48 - based @entity47 -- had empowered the women and for the first time gave them an opportunity to express themselves			1
she said : " you would be amazed how many are there for murder and it 's mostly for killing their husbands			2
they were married at 12 or 13 years old to someone they had never met before			0
" they were pregnant at 13 and had husbands who beat them or had psychological issues			0
if they went to their family or to the police for protection , they would just be told it was a domestic issue			0
" they ended up protecting themselves with their own hands			0
they are not saying their crimes were the best solution , but in some ways they had no other choice			0
" @entity17 said several other inmates were in jail for drug trafficking and their young children were left on the streets			1
" if the woman and her husband are both in prison , there is no protection for their children if they do n't have families who take them , " she said			2
other inmates who are serving shorter sentences for adultery have joined the project for a limited period but will be released before the final production			2
@entity17 said : " for many of them , the real crime was that they were born a woman			1
there 's this underlying patriarchy to everything in this country			0
" who are @entity108 's most influential women ? the play will be performed in the prison in front of invited guests , including government ministers , prison authorities and the women 's families			1
@entity17 said : " they are in prison , but many of have said they feel free for the first time because it 's the first time they can talk about anything they want			1
" the play is giving them the space to do things they have never done before and to convey a message			0
" it 's a message to protect women 's rights and to protect women from domestic violence			1
" another of the inmates is @entity135 , 40 , who was married by her family at the age of 15 to a cousin and had three children			0
she is accused of murdering her husband			0
@entity135 is taking part in a flamenco dance for the production			0
in film footage she said : " for the first time i learn how to move this body of mine , as if i was imprisoned in a body that did n't belong to me			0
" four years ago , @entity17 began a similar project with male inmates in @entity153 's largest prison @entity151			1
a documentary film she made about the work , called " 12 @entity4 , " won several international awards			1
this is the first time she has worked in a women 's prison			1
@entity17 is filming the work in @entity7 for a similar documentary about the women involved			1
she said the women were initially reluctant to show their faces on camera , but eventually realized it was an opportunity to tell their stories			2
" at first they wore disguises to cover their faces when we were filming , but eventually decided to take them off , " said @entity17			2
" people tell me they ca n't believe the women agreed to be filmed because of the stigma , but they had been hidden away all their lives and did n't want to be suppressed anymore			0
" one of the inmates , @entity173 , a 28 - year - old woman serving a three - year jail term for fraud , said in film footage : " i was so worried about appearing in front of the camera , then after thought if i hide my face i 'd be only contributing to hiding myself , my voice , the women and human being within me			2
" i 'm taking off my mask and showing ( myself ) as i wish to			0
