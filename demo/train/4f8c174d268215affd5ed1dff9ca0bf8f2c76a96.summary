-- @entity2 coach @entity1 , the only coach to win @entity5 football 's top three leagues , has told @entity0 in an exclusive interview that his remarkable track record of success and very public profile has had a devastating impact on his personal life			1
after winning league titles with @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity2 as well as @entity15 in his homeland , @entity1 says it has got to the stage where even his 12 - year - old son is taunted when he plays a football match			1
" i hate my social life , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
" i hate not to be a normal father who goes with his son to the son 's football match and being there with the other 20 fathers there watching the game			1
" i 'm at a football match of kids and i have to be there			2
the people have to come for photos ; the people have to come for autographs ; the people have to come to insult me ; the people have to go behind the goal of my kid and insult my kid of 12			0
" as well as his uncanny ability to guide teams to trophy after trophy , @entity1 's very public profile has also been accompanied by an ability to attract headlines -- sometimes unwanted -- where his media conference theatrics have journalists drooling over his every utterance			1
at times the @entity52 coach , who is courted by numerous sponsors , has also tarnished his reputation -- no more so than in last season 's altercation with the now @entity58 manager @entity57 , when @entity1 poked his opponent in the eye			1
" i think it 's quite normal because people think they know me , but they do n't , " added @entity1 , who is bidding to become the first coach to win the @entity65 with three different clubs following his triumphs with @entity15 in 2004 and @entity14 in 2010			1
" people know the manager , especially the manager during 90 minutes			0
and during 90 minutes , i 'm not there to have fun			0
" fun is a consequence			0
i 'm there to do my job , i 'm there to win			0
i 'm there with my team to try to win			0
i 'm there and i live the game , i live the match as if it was the last match of my career			2
" so people look at me and they see what they see			0
after that , in press conferences , it 's the other place where people know me			0
" in press conferences , there is still a match to play			0
before the match , press conference is pre-match and after the match , press conference is post-match , but it 's a match			0
" but @entity1 insisted he was a very different person one from the portrayed by the media			2
" people do n't know me as a friend , as a family man , as a manager inside of my group , the relationship i have with the people that work in the club			0
" so i do n't complain and say people are wrong , people are looking at me with the wrong eye			0
no , these people see what they see			0
" and despite the cost to his personal life , @entity1 insisted he wanted to be a coach for at least another two decades			1
" so , you know , i would love to be with my family in the street as a normal person and i ca n't , so i am a completely different person in my private life , " added @entity1 , who will turn 50 in january			1
" i keep to myself , i keep to the people that are close to me and one day when my career finishes , i hope that i will still have a few years to be a normal person because i want to finish my career at 70 or 75			2
" after guiding @entity15 to the @entity65 in 2004 , @entity1 moved to @entity124 and managed @entity13 , who won two @entity127 titles in 2005 and 2006 under the @entity52 coach and he has often spoken of his desire to return to @entity124			1
there has plenty of speculation he will replace sir @entity133 at @entity134 as the 70 - year - old @entity135 approaches the twilight of his managerial career			1
the two men enjoy a close relationship away from football -- they both share a love of fine wine -- with @entity1 affectionately referring to the @entity134 manager as ' @entity144 '			2
" i call him the boss because he 's the boss of the coaches and i hope that when i go back to @entity124 football he still manages @entity134			1
" i do n't think about that , especially as i have a four - year contract with @entity2 , i sign it and when i sign it , i sign it because i wanted to be in @entity2 at this period of my career and i do n't think in another club			2
" i just say openly that for many reasons that after @entity2 , @entity14 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity13 , @entity124 , @entity15 , @entity52 , that after this project , the next step will be @entity124 for many reasons but when i do n't know			1
" i do n't have an idea and i am so happy to be in this moment as manager of the best club in the world			0
" @entity1 retains a home in @entity168 and was keen to emphasize he is still on friendly terms with @entity13 's billionaire owner @entity170 , revealing that the @entity171 had played a key role in recently allowing @entity174 midfielder @entity173 to make a loan move to @entity2 before the end of the august transfer window			1
" we are in touch a lot , and the last example is @entity173 was going to another club and when i did ( gestures to telephone call ) ' please leave it to your friend ' he left to his friend , " said the @entity2 coach			2
" we have a great relationship in fact			0
