-- normally , its viewers do n't associate " @entity4 " with global politics			1
the annual singing show is a camp retread of the cultural wasteland of the 1970s -- all crashing ballads , gaudy europop and singing penguins			2
@entity11 has signaled its contempt for the contest by sending 76 - year - old @entity14 as its representative , a man once regarded as a stud but who now looks eerily like one of those @entity20 mummies			1
the crooner was born two decades before @entity4 even started , and it 's touch and go whether he 'll survive the weekend			2
however , this year the contest , which holds its finals saturday , has taken on an unexpected degree of controversy			1
it is being held in the oil - rich tyranny of @entity29 , and while contestants were warming up their acts this week , pro-democracy demonstrators were getting beaten in the streets of @entity34			1
the annual singing contest draws an audience of 125 million across @entity37 , so the dictatorial regime of @entity39 had hoped to use it as an opportunity to sell his country to the world			1
instead it has been a public relations disaster			2
explainer : what is @entity4 ? arguably , the outrages in @entity29 have exposed a hidden dimension of @entity4			1
it is and always has been a very political event			2
that 's more obvious this year than most because the politics of @entity37 are so blatantly and unavoidably polarized			1
the most obvious problem is one of definition			2
what on @entity59 , you might ask , is a central @entity61 country like @entity29 doing in a contest called @entity4 ? nothing about contemporary @entity29 marks it out as distinctly @entity65 -- it 's @entity67 , undemocratic and many , many miles away from the continent			1
it 's in the contest by an accident of history : @entity29 used to be part of the @entity73			1
its leaders desperately wish to claim some @entity65 identity because they want to participate in capital and labor markets -- something that should , theoretically , encourage democracy			2
but @entity39 also wants to retain the integrity of a classic @entity61 despotism			2
as the @entity83 engages farther eastward , through @entity84 , it has to deal with nations and cultures like these that do n't precisely fit its @entity89 , liberal template			0
there are plenty of divides within continental @entity37 itself			1
voting has always been political			0
@entity11 's 1997 victory was widely interpreted as a " thumbs up " for having elected the popular liberal leader , @entity97 ; its defeat in 2003 was punishment for the @entity100			0
likewise , @entity4 has traditionally operated a buddy system			0
nordic countries often vote for each other and @entity104 typically favors @entity105			0
in a way , that 's a good thing , because it means that no matter how awful an entry is , someone is duty bound to vote for it			0
@entity11 has been bailed out by faithful little @entity113 several times			0
but the end of the @entity115 dramatically enhanced the role of politics and favoritism in voting			1
for many of the new , @entity122 participants -- particularly in the war - torn @entity123 -- @entity4 became an extension of diplomacy , used to cement alliances with @entity128 or make amends with former enemies			0
songs about regional reconciliation were touching when they debuted in the early 1990s			0
but now they elicit groans from @entity65 voters because they are interpreted as a plea for geographic solidarity			0
the results support the contention that this has become an eastern group hug			0
from 2001 to 2011 , seven out of 11 winners have been @entity122 , with a strong preference for the former @entity73 bloc ( the pattern is just as pronounced in the junior contest )			2
such is the frustration of @entity89 countries that many of them have opted to send novelty acts			0
sometimes that accidentally works ( @entity153 's @entity152 was surely a joke , yet it came in first in 2006 ) , but it often means the folks back home end up humiliated			0
@entity11 's longstanding @entity4 presenter , @entity157 , quit the show in disgust after the @entity11 's entrant , who was black , received only 14 points in 2008			0
blaming the result on @entity165 racial prejudice , @entity157 observed that a contest invented in the 1950s to forge a sense of unity in the @entity115 era has actually become a symbol of how polarized the new @entity37 is			1
and how poor , too			0
@entity173 's entrant , @entity174 , has admitted that it would be better if she did n't win on saturday because she was n't sure that her country could afford to host the contest			1
struggling with soaring debt and unemployment , this former economic miracle is now a pauper state			0
directors from @entity173 's broadcaster , @entity183 , sent a message to @entity174 that read , " please , do n't win ! " never has a sadder truth been spoken in jest			0
@entity4 was probably at its most hopeful and exciting in the early 1990s , when @entity37 was emerging from the nightmare of the @entity115 and it had fantasies of a prosperous , democratic , unified future			1
but @entity29 in 2012 offers a very different vision			1
@entity37 is struggling to integrate countries that have little cultural affinity for it , it is divided by regional loyalties and it is still a long , long way from recovering from the @entity196			1
the @entity65 dream has ended ; the fat lady stopped singing years ago			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			1

@entity201 : *eurovision* is campy , *unserious* and this year has taken on more controversy
he says host @entity29 has *squelched* pro-democracy *protests* , made *bad* pr
he says @entity29 not even in @entity37 , contest marred by politics , skews to @entity213
@entity201 : contest also *reflects* polarization of @entity37
