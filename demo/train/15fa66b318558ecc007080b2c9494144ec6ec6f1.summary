-- @entity1 has so many users -- more than a billion , or roughly the population of @entity4 -- that squeezing them all into one web page seems almost impossible			1
and yet someone has done just that			0
a new project , " the faces of @entity1 , " collects more than 1.27 billion @entity1 profile photos on one site , arranged in chronological order according to when the person joined the social network			1
users can sign in via @entity1 to pinpoint their photo on the page and see where they show up in relation to their friends			1
at first glance , the site looks like colorful , pixelated white noise			0
but users can zoom in to see individual photos and then scroll around or click on a photo to visit that person 's @entity1 page			1
( be warned , however : the page is experiencing heavy traffic and can be slow and buggy			2
) the site launched last week and was built by @entity32 , a self - described " creative technologist " in @entity33 , @entity34			1
" i was playing around with @entity36 , and i discovered that there is a way to access everyone 's public information with a very simple ( but not obvious ) algorithm , " she said in an e-mail to @entity0			0
" at that time , i thought i could do something beautiful / interesting with that , like showing them all together			0
then i started to write the code to achieve it			0
" @entity32 said she is not breaking @entity1 privacy rules because she is not storing anyone 's name , photo or private information -- just linking out to public @entity1 profiles			1
she also said she has n't heard from the social network , which she thinks is good news because " i was a bit worried about things like using their name in the url			0
" @entity1 did not repond to @entity0 's request for comment			2
@entity32 said it took her a year and a half to code the site			2
the hardest part , she said , was stripping out the default silhouette images that appear on some inactive @entity1 profiles			2
asked about her hopes for the project , @entity32 said she was inspired by the idea that each @entity1 profile photo is an example of that person 's best self , and that millions of those images together combine to present a positive , universal message			1
" there is a mix of people from all over the world			0
and somehow we are all telling our friends : ' look , this is me , when i like myself			0
' feeling happy , being creative , looking good , being passionate about something , proud of something , enjoying the life , " she said			0
" so i think , why do n't we try to be our @entity1 profile picture ? even if life is difficult some times , there is always a way for us to be what we want to be : happy			1
