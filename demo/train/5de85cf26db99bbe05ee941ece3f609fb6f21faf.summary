if you think you are tech savvy all because you know what " lol " means , let me test your coolness			2
any idea what " @entity10 " stands for in internet slang ? it 's a declarative statement : i want sex now			1
if it makes you feel any better , i had no clue , and neither did a number of women i asked about it			2
acronyms are widely popular across the @entity19 , especially on social media and texting apps , because , in some cases , they offer a shorthand for communication that is meant to be instant			1
so " @entity25 " -- let me know -- and " @entity26 " -- will you call me ? -- are innocent enough			2
but the issue , especially for parents , is understanding the slang that could signal some dangerous teen behavior , such as " @entity32 , ' " which means " get naked on camera			1
" and it certainly helps for a parent to know that " @entity44 " means parent in room , which could mean the teen wants to have a conversation about things that his or her mom and dad might not approve of			0
@entity45 is a national @entity19 safety expert who has provided @entity19 and technology safety training to schools , law enforcement agencies and community organizations throughout the country for more than seven years			1
she says research shows that a majority of teens believe that their parents are starting to keep tabs on their online and social media lives			1
" with that , acronyms can be used by kids to hide certain parts of their conversations from attentive parents , " @entity45 said			1
" acronyms used for this purpose could potentially raise some red flags for parents			1
" but parents would drive themselves crazy , she said , if they tried to decode every text , email and post they see their teen sending or receiving			1
" i 've seen some before and it 's like ' the @entity77 , ' where only the kids hold the true meanings ( and most of the time they 're fairly innocuous ) , " she said			1
still , if parents come across any acronyms they believe could be problematic , they should talk with their kids about them , said @entity45			1
but how , on earth , is a parent to keep up with all these acronyms , especially since new ones are being introduced every day ? " it 's a lot to keep track of , " @entity45 said			1
parents can always do a @entity93 search if they stumble upon an phrase they are n't familiar with , but the other option is asking their children , since these phrases can have different meanings for different people			1
" asking kids not only gives you great information , but it shows that you 're paying attention and sparks the conversation around their online behaviors , which is imperative			1
" @entity106 , a mom of two in @entity109 , @entity110 , says she finds @entity19 acronyms " baffling , annoying and hilarious at the same time			1
" she 's none too pleased that acronyms like " lol " and " @entity115 " are being adopted into conversation , and already told her 12 - year - old son -- whom she jokingly calls " deprived , " since he does not have a phone yet -- that acronym talk is not allowed in her presence			1
but the issue really came to a head when her son and his adolescent friends got together and were all " ignoring one another with noses in their phones , " said @entity106 , founder of @entity125			0
" i announced my invention of a new acronym : ' @entity131			0
' put your freaking phone down			0
" lol ! but back to the serious issue at hand , below are 28 internet acronyms , which i learned from @entity45 and other parents i talked with , as well as from sites such as @entity140 and @entity141 , and from @entity143 's 99 acronyms and phrases that every parent should know			1
after you read this list , you 'll likely start looking at your teen 's texts in a whole new way			0
