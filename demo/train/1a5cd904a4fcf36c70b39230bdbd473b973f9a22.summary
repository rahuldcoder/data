-- with so many means for guests to leave feedback on hotels worldwide , it 's easy to take those opportunities for granted			0
but what would workers in the hospitality industry say if they were asked to comment on their employers ? we 'll soon find out , thanks to a new @entity13 page that lets hotel employees share stories of demanding bosses , long shifts and finicky guests			1
the inspiration for " @entity20 " comes from a likely source : @entity22 , who became a viral video sensation and working - class hero in october for posting a @entity26 video of him resigning from his hotel job accompanied by a marching band			1
with more than 2.8 million views in just over a month , the @entity26 video generated more than 4,000 comments and even more e-mails , @entity34 messages and cell phone texts , @entity22 said			1
much of the response came from current and former hotel workers who said they related to @entity22 's complaints of struggles with management			2
" we did not expect to get all this attention			0
but when we did , we knew we had to do something with it , " the 23 - year - old @entity42 said			0
websites such as @entity46 are backed by unions and address conditions from a labor standpoint			0
but " @entity20 " appears to be one of few forums dedicated exclusively to letting individuals air grievances			2
the site 's masthead bears a screen grab from the @entity26 video of @entity22 's triumphant face next to messages in @entity60 and @entity61 urging users to submit stories about their hotel workplace			1
" inspired by the success of the ' @entity20 ' video and responses to it from other hotel workers , we created this site to collect stories about unjust working conditions in the hotel industry , " the site says , also in @entity60 and @entity61			1
the feed , which launched this week , had 10 entries as of tuesday morning , including videos of @entity22 and other former employees of the @entity78 , the site of @entity22 's famous resignation			2
the rest are anonymous or come from users claiming to be former hotel industry employees			0
@entity0 could not verify their claims			0
the goal is not to encourage boycotts of the accused hotels but to hold them accountable by raising awareness of undesirable conditions , hopefully paving the way to stronger labor laws , @entity22 said			1
" the site is intended for workers so they can read it and know they 're not alone , that others are experiencing the same things as them , creating a sense of working - class identity and hotel worker identity that 's crucial to transforming the industry and forming unions , " he said			2
" the other audience is the public that 's visiting the hotels , so they know how bad conditions are and let their disapproval be known with their wallets until things change			0
