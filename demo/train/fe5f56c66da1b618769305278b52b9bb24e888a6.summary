@entity0 -- imagine a vulnerable island , parts of it man - made , with towering buildings and lots of people crammed into small spaces			1
now imagine a monster storm slamming into that island			2
it could happen sunday , and hurricane experts are warning @entity0 that even though @entity11 may not be a killer in the vein of @entity17 , millions of people could be trapped in their homes for days			1
without power , transportation , phones -- and experience			1
a hurricane warning was issued late friday afternoon for the @entity0 area , as well as points eastward to @entity26 , @entity27 , stoking fears that @entity11 could be the most destructive hurricane to hit the metropolis since 1938			1
" the basic issue is , first , @entity0 has world - class emergency planners			1
i mean , they 're the best in the game			2
but the city is out of practice when it comes to hurricanes , " said homeland security expert @entity36 , author of " @entity37			1
" but it 's not just @entity0 that faces @entity11 's wrath as it churns northward			1
a heavily populated urban corridor from the nation 's capital to the @entity0 metropolitan area stands a chance of a wet and windy lashing			1
@entity51 secretary @entity50 warned that significant power outages are likely on the @entity53			2
" this is n't a mammoth storm ... in terms of lots of death and destruction , but what it is going to do is be very disruptive , and people have to be in position to camp out in their house , " @entity36 said			2
" @entity65 is always your ally before a disaster			0
it 's always your enemy after a disaster , " he said			0
" using the time now to get prepared is key			0
when you have that many people packed in a little space , as dependent as they are on the transportation , everybody has to get informed and get better prepared			1
" but a survey released friday indicated that the regions that are least likely to be prepared are urban areas in the @entity81 , and many of them may be in the path of @entity11			0
according to a @entity1 / @entity86 , 45 % of @entity85 say they have a stockpile of food and water in their homes in case of a terrorist attack or a natural disaster like a hurricane or earthquake			1
those figures are highest in the @entity98 and the @entity99 -- where hurricanes and earthquakes are most frequent -- but only 36 % of @entity102 say they have emergency supplies of food and water			2
people who live in rural areas are also more prepared than people who live in big cities : only 42 % in urban areas have a stockpile of food and water , compared with 51 % of rural residents			2
in recent days , though , public officials have made frequent media appearances and taken other steps to indicate that they are ready for the storm			0
that includes shutting down all public transportation in @entity0 -- including subways , buses and commuter rails -- after noon saturday			1
gov. @entity122 has also ordered the @entity123 to deploy up to 900 troops			2
and most bridges in and around the city will be closed to traffic if winds exceed 60 mph , as would be the case with hurricane winds in excess of 74 mph			1
" the sun is shining , but do n't be misled , " @entity0 mayor @entity132 said friday afternoon			1
" there is a very dangerous storm headed in our direction			0
" mandatory evacuations have been issued for some low - lying areas in all five of the city 's boroughs , including @entity142 in @entity143 , @entity144 in @entity145 and @entity146 on the southern tip of @entity10			1
some of those are patients in five hospitals , eight nursing homes and other medical facilities that had to be moved out by 8 p.m. friday , per the mayor 's orders			2
in addition , @entity132 said that 91 emergency facilities -- which , among other purposes , will act as shelters -- opened across the city			2
it 's not just @entity10 that will be tested			0
@entity36 noted that @entity161 , home of the boroughs of @entity145 and @entity143 and many other communities farther east , has 7.5 million people crammed together			1
if it were a state unto itself , it would be the nation 's seventh largest -- and one that , likewise , is facing a hurricane warning			1
" it 's an island			0
the only way to get off and on to it is through the two boroughs and @entity145 and the @entity175 , and what we know is , we 're going to have a lot of outages , " @entity36 said			0
at 3 p.m. friday , @entity181 ordered mandatory evacuations of barrier beach communities , particularly those on the western end of @entity186 , county spokesman @entity180 said			1
further evacuations in low - lying , beachside communities -- including parts of the @entity190 and @entity191 -- could be mandated saturday morning , he added			1
" we expect long , long delays as these roads start to get jammed , " @entity193 town supervisor @entity192 said			0
" we are sitting at 125 miles in the @entity197 , and there are -- from @entity199 to the end of @entity161 -- only two lanes			1
if you have to get somewhere and you want to get home , you better get on the road soon			0
" on @entity186 , nervous residents put away outdoor furniture , and the parking lot at @entity208 was filled as shoppers stuffed suvs with bottled water and groceries			0
transit systems in @entity214 and @entity215 will also shut down saturday , though the operators of @entity218 's subway system vowed on friday to add extra resources and stay operational through the storm			0
and travelers planning to fly out of any of the busy airports in the @entity224 and @entity0 areas are in for a headache			1
thousands of weekend flights already have been canceled			0
@entity228 / @entity227 is " monitoring terminal and airfield drainage , checking generators and securing any equipment that may become airborne as a result of high winds , " said @entity229 , the airport 's executive director			0
carriers are monitoring the weather conditions carefully and taking action			0
@entity240 , president and ceo of the power company @entity242 , said that close to a thousand line personnel were getting ready to handle outages just in the @entity224 area			2
" we 've been absolutely anticipating that this is going to hit us hard			0
it 's going to hit us to varying degrees , probably less so here where we are but more as you move east of our service territory going over to @entity252 , " he said			0
" but we 're anticipating that with the kind of rain and sustained wind , we 're very likely going to have some serious damage and actually multi-day outages			0
" the main event in @entity224 this weekend was supposed to be the much - awaited dedication of the @entity260			0
but as the district 's homeland security department tweeted friday : " @entity224 's focus has shifted to # @entity11			0
that 's what 's happening in the city this weekend			2
