the post-election violence left 200 people dead and thousands more injured , according to rights groups			0
is @entity1 ready for elections ? depends on who you ask what do we need to know about these elections ? they are taking place under a new constitution endorsed in a march referendum that limits the president to two five - year terms			1

on his release he formed @entity41 , which he led from neighboring @entity69			0
the conflict came at the same time as the @entity71 in @entity72 , led by @entity73 , engaged in its struggle to overthrow apartheid , a cause that drew strong support from @entity3 and his followers			2

a @entity83 cable released in 2011 claiming @entity3 had prostate cancer was dismissed by his party			2
what problems has @entity1 faced ? @entity3 's liberation credentials held him in good stead during the early part of his leadership , with many seeing him as a politician who could unite a country that had been divided through civil conflict			1
but in 2000 he drew criticism for his land reform program , when white farmers were evicted from their land , which was given to poor black @entity1 , many of them veterans of the struggle for independence with limited knowledge of commercial farming			2

a power - sharing agreement was eventually signed in september 2008 , but a government of national unity was only formed in february 2009 , after @entity44 was sworn in as prime minister			1

@entity1 's economy recorded real growth of more than 9 % per year in 2010 - 11 , before slowing to 5 % in 2012 , mainly because of a poor harvest and low diamond revenues			1
