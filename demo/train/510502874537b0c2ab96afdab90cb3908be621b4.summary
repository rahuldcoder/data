-- we moved to suburban @entity2 in january 2003 , just months before @entity3 graduated from @entity4 and was drafted by the @entity5			1
my teenage sons were 3 and 5 years old when we became @entity5 season ticket holders during @entity3 ' rookie year			1
we were faithful @entity5 regulars for eight seasons			1
four years ago , my son , now 16 , was devastated when @entity3 took his talents to @entity13			1
he still has a @entity5 ' @entity15 poster in his room			1
@entity18 ' house is within walking distance to ours			0
our sons went to the same school			1
my 13 - year - old is a bit older , but would chat with and high - five @entity3 ' son , @entity3 @entity25 played basketball with the middle school boys when the school opened a new gym			1
he talked to the children in the halls , often urging them to do well in school			2
we 'd see him shopping at @entity32 or @entity33 , but we would give him his space			0
you see , my sons like @entity3			1
they grew up with @entity3			1
and now he 's home			2
friday 's announcement that @entity3 is returning to northeast @entity40 capped off a spectacular week of @entity5 in the national spotlight			1
on monday , thanks to the diligence of hardworking local organizers , the @entity42 announced its 2016 convention would be hosted in @entity5			1
the city is experiencing a renaissance and the world is taking note , even if national media is having a hard time embracing it			0
for those who had n't noticed , things are indeed hot in @entity5			1
a new convention center recently opened , hotels are being built , businesses are moving in , the biotech industry is thriving			0
the @entity59 have a hopeful new star and the prodigal son is coming home			2
the sun has never shined as bright in @entity5 as it did friday			1
as a crowd gathered friday afternoon in front of @entity67 , home of the @entity5 and host of the @entity42 's 2016 convention , residents celebrated			1
" stuff like this does n't happen to @entity5 , " several fans said , repeatedly			1
@entity73 have endured the departure of its athletic stars , the failure to win championships of its teams and the mockery that has come from political and sports analysts about why a political convention or the @entity85 's biggest star would go to @entity5			1
yes , @entity5 was heartbroken when @entity3 announced his decision to go to @entity13			1
but the city 's wrath was never as extreme as the national media played it			0
everyone was n't intoxicated and burning jerseys as the ongoing loop on sports television suggested			0
we were , however , a city scorned			0
many , if not most , understood the decision but hated the way it was delivered -- especially the people of @entity2			0
but even then , kids bought the @entity13 jerseys or @entity3 sneakers and followed @ @entity103 religiously on @entity104			2
some men , young and old , even bought plane tickets to watch @entity3 play in @entity13			2
still , @entity3 ' departure stung			2
he had loyalty tattooed on his chest			0
for @entity73 , that was supposed to mean something			0
months later , i wrote a personal letter to @entity3 that i never mailed			2
in it , i told him that the choice was his to make but his departure method had made me cringe			0
the mother in me wished he had gone to the ' q to shake the hands of the security guards , custodial staff and the kitchen staff and to look in the eyes of @entity5 leadership while thanking them for unwavering support			2
i wanted to tell him how much he had bruised our local children			0
i wanted him to set a better example			0
i wanted him to know there were still boys in @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity2 who were looking up to him			0
but today is a new day			0
@entity5 is standing proud and tall			2
it 's distinguished by its passion , a passion that outsiders do n't always understand and those of us who live here do n't always appreciate			0
no other city has greater cheerleaders or bigger fans			0
as political analysts second - guessed this week 's @entity42 choice rather than the selection of @entity150 and as sports analysts complained about having to spend more time working in @entity5 rather than sipping mojitos on @entity153 , the people who live here have a deeply affectionate relationship with the city			1
as @entity157 , a local business owner tweeted , " it 's been an amazing week for our beloved @entity5			1
" what the world is witnessing is true civic pride			0
the kind of pride that comes when you believe you 've worked hard and someone else has finally noticed			0
ours is pride that comes from feeling like someone has finally stood up for you			0
on friday , @entity3 stood up for @entity5 , for @entity2 , for northeast @entity40			1
i never mailed my letter to mr. @entity3 , but i think he has long since gotten the message			2
join us on @entity173 / @entity172 .			0

@entity175 says @entity3 returning is a gift to the region
she lives blocks from @entity3 ' home and her sons went to the same school
*coupled* with the @entity42 announcement , this was a good week for @entity5
