@entity1 's civil war is not @entity3 's problem			1
@entity1 is surrounded by @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 , and other @entity9 nations with large standing armies and advanced military equipment			1
their cowardice in acting to stop a war on their doorstep should give us pause for thought			0
why will they not act , but we must ? why is @entity3 gullibility for war so strong that countries such as @entity24 , @entity4 , and @entity5 can dispense of their moral duties to the @entity3 taxpayer ? make no mistake about it : @entity29 is a war criminal , having had his own civilians and soldiers slaughtered in a war to keep his family in power			2
the sectarian , ethnic , and religious dimensions of the war have kept the @entity40 administration ( rightly in my view ) away from direct military involvement in the conflict			1
but what has changed now ? the use of chemical weapons to kill people jolts us into probable action , but millions displaced , wounded and 100,000 dead did not			0
why ? because the banality of the policy shift rests on the assumptions that @entity3 cruise missiles can prevent further use of chemical weapons , provide a face - saving measure for president @entity40 who can argue that he acted after his " red line " had been crossed in @entity1 , and neuter critics of @entity40 's @entity1 policy			1
there is no absolute certainty as to whether @entity29 used chemical weapons , or rebel factions did			0
@entity64 has no credible motivation to use these weapons at this stage , and in this phase of the conflict			0
if , as the @entity72 claim , it was @entity75 - affiliated @entity74 group or @entity77 elements that used weapons to bait @entity3 into the conflict , then @entity3 firepower would be futile in establishing how a ragtag army and terrorists obtained chemical weapons			2
no amount of surgical strikes on government facilities will prevent non-state actors from further use of these weapons			0
what justifies intervening if @entity1 uses chemical weapons ? but if we believe that @entity29 used these weapons , and launch punitive attacks on @entity1 , what exactly are we targeting ? the secretive and globally isolated nature of the @entity29 regime and therefore his chemical stockpiles means that we do not know where these are located			1
we intervened in @entity99 with greater confidence because @entity102 's chemical weapons were mostly eliminated by an international inspection arrangement prior to the @entity9 uprisings			0
by bombing @entity1 now we increase the risk of @entity29 using chemical weapons on populations and cities that are not under government control , or to quell new rebellions			1
damaging his air force and known military installation would force him to consider his more extreme options for regime survival			0
@entity1 is now a fight to the death for both sides			2
@entity3 - led military strikes in @entity1 will not change the tide of the war			1
that is not the mission , nor is it achievable by aerial blitzing			0
the @entity1 opposition is not a government in waiting			2
it is too fragmented ideologically , overwrought by @entity75 affiliates , deeply anti-american , and dominated by suburban fighters with little control of major cities , mercenaries who are not committed to peaceful coexistence with @entity1 's religious @entity134 , nor its @entity136 neighbor			1
@entity1 after @entity29 will be worse			2
a new civil war will break out between opposition factions			0
by bombing @entity1 today , we bear the burden of the instability we leave in our wake			1
president @entity40 imprudently mentioned a " red line " in @entity1 and is now hostage to fortune			2
the president has changed his policy stance on using illegal wire taps , closing @entity150 , gay marriage , and more			0
opinion : 5 reasons the @entity3 must intervene in @entity1 the heat of the moment and push from the chattering classes to " do something " without knowing what will consume @entity40 into another @entity160 war			1
he beat @entity162 as an anti-iraq war candidate			0
by intervening , @entity1 may well prove to be @entity40 's war , bequeathed to a new president in 2016			0
civilian casualties are inevitable : the images on our screens will not be @entity1 using chemical weapons to kill each other , but @entity3 bombs creating carnage and killings in yet another @entity177 country .			1

sectarian , ethnic , and religious dimensions have kept the @entity3 away from direct involvement , writes @entity181
he asks : if punitive attacks on @entity1 are launched , what exactly are we targeting ?
