@entity0 won another battle against @entity2 this week			0
a federal appeals court , on thursday , refused to grant another hearing to the organization , a decision that stops the organization 's fight against @entity0 ' effort to ban state funding for @entity2 affiliates			1
@entity0 gov. @entity12 applauded the decision , by the 5th @entity13			1
" today 's ruling affirms yet again that in @entity0 the @entity15 has no obligation to fund @entity2 and other organizations that perform or promote abortion			2
in @entity0 we choose life , and we will immediately begin defunding all abortion affiliates to honor and uphold that choice , " @entity12 said			2
the decision continues a legal struggle that has been going on for months			0
the @entity25 provides about 130,000 low - income women with family planning exams , related health screenings and contraception			0
@entity0 opposed government funding for @entity2 clinics because the organization provides abortions			1
the state said in march that it was willing to give up funding from @entity37 and run the @entity15 itself			0
it then adopted a rule that required clinics funded by the program to certify they do not perform abortions or are not affiliates of entities that perform abortions			1
in a letter to @entity0 officials in march , medicaid director @entity48 said the state 's decision was regrettable			2
it would , she said , " prevent women enrolled in the program from receiving services from the trusted health care providers they have chosen and relied on for their care			0
" @entity2 sued @entity0 , winning an injunction against the law by arguing that abortion is constitutional and @entity0 ' efforts would block women 's access to preventive health care			1
but a federal court later ruled in favor of @entity0 .			0
