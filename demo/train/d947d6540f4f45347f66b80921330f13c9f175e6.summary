-- @entity2 's remarks on @entity3 may be constitutionally protected , but he has learned there is nothing shielding him from the ire of @entity9 's large @entity8 community			1
his comment to @entity11 that he loves @entity3 and later comment that he " respects " him rankled the @entity8 - @entity14 community in @entity9 , home to the baseball team @entity2 manages , the @entity15			1
the team 's stadium is located in the area of the city known as @entity20			2
the reaction by the team was swift -- a five - game suspension			0
@entity25 commissioner @entity24 supported the move			0
" mr. @entity2 's remarks , which were offensive to an important part of the @entity9 community and others throughout the world , have no place in our game , " he said tuesday			1
and the reaction by some in the @entity8 - @entity14 community has been even stronger			0
according to local media , one anti-castro organization , @entity38 , called for a boycott of the @entity15 and began picketing the baseball stadium tuesday			0
the fallout may cost @entity2 the trust of @entity9 fans			1
" there is absolutely nothing not protected by the @entity49 that he said , " @entity46 professor @entity45 said			1
it was an example of political speech , pure and simple			0
but free speech can have is consequences , as @entity2 is learning			1
" the problem is , he 's in @entity9 , " @entity55 said			1
@entity9 's @entity8 community is made up of a large number of exiles who fled the @entity3 regime and who strongly lobby in support of the @entity14 embargo against @entity64 and other @entity66 measures			1
@entity64 's current president is @entity3 's brother , @entity67			1
in another city , @entity2 's comments may not have been as controversial , but in @entity9 , there is a unique sensitivity to @entity3 , @entity55 said			1
" i think it 's kind of silly , but it 's where he happens to be , " he said			2
if the government had suspended an public employee for political speech , it would be illegal , he said			0
but the @entity15 , as a private entity , can mete out punishment as they see fit , especially when it offends a segment of their fan base			0
the @entity15 have a need and interest to protect their market , and , in fact , are using their own free speech interest in handing down the suspension , the law professor said			0
@entity15 fans on social media came out on both sides of the debate			0
@entity2 apologized tuesday in @entity95 at a news conference , saying his words were misconstrued and that he finds @entity3 's human rights record odious			1
but for @entity8 and @entity8 - @entity14 fans , the damage was done			0
@entity101 of the @entity102 eloquently summed up the emotions that @entity2 's comments stirred			1
" there are people in @entity107 who are angry with @entity2 because he struck an emotional and painful nerve			2
i am unapologetically one of those people because the communist dictator @entity2 apparently loves broke my family , " he wrote in a column			2
@entity101 said he would prefer to see an indefinite suspension for the manager			0
other @entity15 fans , even if they disagreed with @entity2 's remarks , did n't like the way the suspension was handled			1
@entity120 , a longtime fan , said that @entity9 " is the last place you want to say something like that			2
" still , he drew a distinction between the ball club suspending @entity2 for what he said , rather than acting in response to fan outcries			2
to suspend @entity2 for the content of what he said -- no matter how wrongheaded -- comes across as a violation of his right to free speech , @entity120 said			2
but if the club instead reacted to business interests such as fear of a boycott or financial loss , then a punitive action is justified			0
and the action that fans clamor for , @entity120 said , might be more stringent that the five - game suspension			0
" i do n't think @entity15 fans will forgive him for this , " he said .			0

@entity2 's comments are protected by the @entity49
but there is a fallout from his remarks about @entity3
in @entity9 , @entity3 is a very sensitive topic
