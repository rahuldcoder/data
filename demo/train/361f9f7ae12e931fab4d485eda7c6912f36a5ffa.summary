@entity0 -- an advertisement for @entity4 perfume featuring teenage actor @entity5 has been banned in @entity6 because it " sexualized children			1
" the ad , for @entity4 " oh , @entity10 ! " fragrance , featured @entity5 , the child star of " @entity11 " and " @entity12 " wearing a short dress and holding an oversized bottle of the scent in her lap. four readers complained that the photograph -- which appeared in two @entity6 magazines in august -- was " offensive and irresponsible , " for showing @entity5 , 17 , " in a sexualized manner			1
" @entity6 's advertising regulator , the @entity21 ( @entity22 ) agreed with the complaints , and has banned the picture from use in the @entity6			2
@entity26 @entity6 , the perfume 's manufacturer insisted that the ad " did not show any private parts or sexual activity " and said it was " provoking , but not indecent			2
" but the @entity22 ruled that @entity5 " was holding up the perfume bottle ... in her lap between her legs and we considered that its position was sexually provocative			0
" in a statement , it said that while it accepted that @entity5 was 17 , " we considered she looked under the age of 16 , " and that her outfit and pose " drew attention to her sexuality			1
" " because of that ... we considered the ad could be seen to sexualize a child			0
we therefore concluded that the ad was irresponsible and was likely to cause serious offense			0
" it is not the first time the @entity22 has banned advertisements featuring @entity56 stars -- in july , the watchdog ruled against a make - up ad starring @entity59 , on the grounds it had been airbrushed too heavily .			0
