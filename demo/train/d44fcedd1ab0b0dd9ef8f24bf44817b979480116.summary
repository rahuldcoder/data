@entity24 is a majority @entity28 nation			0
the largest group of @entity5 citizens and residents who have provided manpower and money to @entity0 reside in @entity17			2
according to a count by the @entity36 , 22 residents of @entity17 have funded or fought with @entity0 during the past four years			0
opinion : how @entity0 picks its targets three of them provided funds to @entity0 , and 19 have been indicted for traveling to fight in @entity1 or have died in the war there			1
the story of @entity47 support for @entity0 began in late 2007 , when @entity48 , an @entity5 citizen of @entity1 descent in his early 30s , and several other men met at a @entity17 mosque and discussed traveling to @entity1 to fight for @entity0			1
@entity48 told the group that he had " experienced true brotherhood " while fighting in @entity1 and that " jihad would be fun " and they would " get to shoot guns , " according to the @entity58			1
that meeting resulted in seven men traveling from @entity17 to @entity1 to fight for @entity0 in late 2007			2
one was @entity61 , a 26 - year - old naturalized @entity5 citizen			0
@entity61 became the first @entity5 to conduct a suicide attack when he drove a truck loaded with explosives toward a government compound in @entity66 , northern @entity1 , blowing himself up and killing 20 other people in october 29 , 2008			1

on september 17 , 2009 , two stolen @entity90 vehicles loaded with bombs blew up at the @entity86 airport , killing more than a dozen peacekeepers of the @entity77			0
the @entity78 suspects that 18 - year - old @entity94 of @entity14 was one of the bombers			0
for those @entity5 who have traveled to @entity1 to fight for @entity0 , it has often proved to be a one - way ticket			1
a 2011 report by the @entity5 @entity99 on @entity100 found that at least 15 @entity5 had died while fighting for @entity0 ( as well as three @entity101 )			1
opinion : what threat do foreign jihadists pose ? some of the young men who volunteered to fight in @entity1 had grown up in the @entity107 neighborhood of @entity70 , which is one of the poorest places in the @entity5			2
in recent years , @entity1 - @entity5 family incomes there averaged less than $ 15,000 a year , and the unemployment rate was 17 %			2
@entity0 's @entity5 support network also extended well beyond @entity17			1

@entity128 , an @entity129 convert to @entity130 from @entity14 , was killed in @entity1 in 2008			0
a former @entity5 soldier , @entity131 , 24 , of @entity132 , @entity18 , was arrested by @entity134 authorities in december 2011 as he tried to make his way to @entity1 to join @entity0 , which he told @entity78 agents he considered to be a religious duty			1
@entity138 of @entity139 , @entity20 , grew up baptist and converted to @entity130 when he was in his teens			0
in a lengthy autobiography that @entity138 posted online last year entitled " @entity143 , " he explained his long journey from growing up @entity28 in a small town in @entity20 to fighting on the front lines in @entity1 with @entity0			2
the journey began with a life - changing trip to @entity149 , the homeland of his father , when he was 15 that sparked his interest in @entity130			0
@entity138 wrote in his autobiography ( @entity154 ) , " when i came back from that vacation , i had become a different person			0
" over the past several years , @entity138 rose up the ranks in @entity0 , becoming an important leader			0
disputes with other @entity0 leaders led him to split off from the group			0
he was killed this month , probably by members of @entity0 , according to @entity164 websites			0
in the wake of many of these developments , for the past three years , the @entity58 and the @entity78 have engaged in a serious effort to crack down on @entity5 support for @entity0 , in particular in @entity17 , in an effort codenamed @entity171			1
this seems to have had some success , as the number of @entity5 indicted for supporting @entity0 on the front lines or with their wallets has dropped sharply since the launch of @entity171			2
@entity0 breaks new ground with complex @entity180 attack over the weekend , @entity0 issued a list of nine names it claimed were among the attackers who carried out its deadly assault on the upscale @entity185 in @entity180 , @entity134			0
@entity0 alleged that three of the attackers were from the @entity5			2
the @entity78 is looking into whether these claims are true			0
whether or not any @entity5 played a role in the massacre in @entity180 that has claimed 62 lives , there is a deadly history of @entity5 support for @entity0 .			1
