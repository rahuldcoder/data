@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 died wednesday at the age of 56			1
within minutes of the announcement , @entity6 and other digital channels were flooded with outpourings of grief for a very private man who leaves a very big mark on the world			2
it is the footprint , not of a manager or philanthropist , but of an entrepreneur			2
his legacy is that of an individual who used his drive , vision , curiosity and keen intelligence to follow new possibilities relentlessly without being deterred by the obstacles on his path			2
from the introduction of the first @entity29 computer in the late 1970s to his " wilderness years " at @entity31 and @entity32 in the late 1980s and early 1990s to his leadership in developing the @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 during the last 10 years at @entity29 , @entity3 turned his energy to creating new offerings that change people 's lives			1
from the get - go , he understood he was living in a moment of far - reaching transformation that we now call the @entity45 and that in such a moment , a lot is at stake			2
invested with a sense of his importance on a stage where everything from telephony to publishing to music distribution was up for grabs , he knew there was no time to lose in developing powerful , beautiful , engaging products and services			1
this understanding fueled the relentless pace of innovation at @entity29 during the last 13 years			2
( it may also have fed his often severe , controlling and still - inspiring managerial style			0
) undoubtedly , the breadth of @entity3 ' vision steered @entity29 toward market leadership and a long series of financial home runs			1
but throughout @entity3 ' journey , we never thought it was solely -- or even primarily -- about the money			1
more than 15 years ago , @entity3 realized that ( what we then called ) the @entity73 was bigger and bolder than groovy products and the convergence of technologies			1
it was about democratizing all kinds of activity by breaking down barriers in how information is distributed			0
as he explained to @entity84 , this development meant " individuals can now do things that only large groups of people with lots of money could do before			0
... ( @entity91 ) e have much more opportunity for people to get to the marketplace -- not just the marketplace of commerce but the marketplace of ideas			0
the marketplace of publications , the marketplace of public policy			0
" if we think about the role of smartphones in the @entity108 or the @entity110 protests , we see just how right @entity3 was			1
this is impact , measured in a deep , lasting way			0
and this is how ultimately @entity3 will be remembered			1
as an entrepreneur -- like @entity117 or perhaps @entity118 -- whose vision expanded both our sense of individual freedom and connection with each one another			0
in an uncharacteristically candid speech at @entity124 in 2005 , @entity3 advised young people to follow their passion and stay foolish and hungry			1
he did this all his life , and the world will never be the same			0
small wonder we grieve today			0
