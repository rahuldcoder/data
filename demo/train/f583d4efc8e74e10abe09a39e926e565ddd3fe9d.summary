@entity0 , @entity1 -- to set foot on @entity4 is to risk death			1
mountaineering tourists and their native @entity1 guides both have this on their minds , as they straddle cavernous ravines in the ice			1
but nothing could have prepared @entity14 climber @entity13 for last week 's avalanche , the deadliest accident in the history of the world 's highest peak			1
" we 've all seen death on the mountains , " he told @entity2 's @entity20 on " @entity21 " wednesday			1
but to see so many limp bodies hanging from cables as helicopters brought them down the mountain shocked him			1
@entity13 was one of the fortunate ones			2
his sherpa guide , @entity31 , shoved him behind an ice block when the icy avalanche thundered down , killing 13 @entity30 guides friday			1
three more sherpas are missing and feared dead			1
@entity36 clergy commended all 16 souls monday in a religious ceremony			2
the search for those still missing has been suspended , and it is doubtful it will resume , @entity1 officials said			2
' get down ! ' " get down ! get down ! " @entity13 heard @entity30 yell before the ice rushed past him			1
the moment was like a flash , but @entity13 remembers it in detail			1
" you 're already in the icefall , which is a pretty sketchy place , " he said			2
the possibility of danger in the shifting and changing ice masses riddled with fissures had his instincts on alert			1
" you 're crossing ladders and crevasses , and you 're pretty aware of your surroundings , " he said			2
climbers are used to looking out to avoid getting hit by falling ice blocks , he said			1
but when the ice avalanche broke loose from the @entity65 , it sent his mind racing			1
" you could see it			2
i heard it , and i looked up , and i saw it break off the side of a shoulder , and you heard it crash down			2
" seconds later , the valley was full of ice boulders ; the path up the mountain obscured			1
his sherpa had saved his life			1
then @entity13 asked himself : is anyone under the ice ? selfless sherpas nearly a third of the group of 50 that had set out up the icefall was missing			1
radios began squawking , and @entity13 heard terror in the @entity83 ' voices as they spoke			2
" he did not dive himself , " @entity13 said			2
@entity31 tended to @entity13 first			2
then , the guide with 24 years of experience embarked on the grimmest task of his career			1
" he spent his whole day that day digging his friends out of the snow and hooking them up to cables and flying them down the mountain , " @entity13 said			1
at the end of a 16 - hour day , @entity30 came by @entity13 's tent before heading to bed to see if he was all right			2
" these are such selfless people , " @entity13 said			1
emotional rubble the mountaineering group milled around base camp wednesday with a lot on their minds -- especially the families of the sherpas who died			1
" all those kids , whose dads are n't coming home , " he said			2
many sherpas left the camp to attend funerals and bury their dead friends			1
most did not return , but @entity31 came back to talk to @entity13			2
he told the @entity14 climber that he wanted to stand by his side but that he could not continue			1
" @entity13 , i just ca n't go back up that hill " were his words , @entity13 said			2
death has climbers taking inner inventory , @entity13 said			1
" thinking , reassessing life , reassessing our values			0
" @entity129 but as the mountain can be deadly for the ethnic group indigenous to the cold peaks of the @entity134 , it is also the @entity83 ' lifeblood			0
leading expeditions is how they feed their families			1
for many , the guides are the only breadwinners			0
@entity142 , 26 , for example , supported his three younger siblings and mother from the money he made taking foreign nationals around the mountain			1
he was among the 13 dead whose bodies were taken around @entity0 in a funeral procession monday			1
ultimately , the guides may decide to forge ahead , but they may be out of business already			0
" the major expeditions pulled the plug , " @entity13 said			1
he predicted @entity4 would close to climbers this year			0
at least six companies that lead @entity4 expeditions have called off their 2014 climbs			1
@entity159 , a spokeswoman for @entity160 in @entity161 told @entity2 : " this is completely unique			0
nothing like this ( number of cancellations ) has ever happened			0
" and peak season is just beginning			0
between may 15 and 30 is usually the best window for reaching the peak			0
foreign climbers spend between $ 40,000 and $ 90,000 each in their attempt to scale the mountain			0
@entity1 's government rakes in about $ 3 million from @entity4 climbers during the high season			0
sherpas make up to $ 6,000 per season			1
they also usually get a summit bonus if their clients reach the top of the 8,848 - meter ( 29,029 - foot ) mountain			0
now they want to be paid in full even if the climbs are abandoned			0
@entity183 calls off coverage of @entity4 wingsuit jump mounting deaths the mountain guides are not looking to quit their work , but they feel more is due to them for the risk they take			0
they want to know that they 're covered if something like this happens to them			0
they want higher life insurance payouts			0
" it 's overdue , " @entity13 said			0
climbers want to see the @entity83 ' demands met			0
until the late 1970s , only a handful of climbers reached the top each year			0
the number topped 100 for the first time in 1993			0
by 2004 , it was more than 300			0

the deadliest year on @entity4 was 1996 , when 15 people died			0
another 12 climbers were killed in 2006			0
@entity13 does n't think any of the climbers at the base camp would be able to reach the top of @entity4 this year			0
the focus it takes to survive , he said , is gone			0
