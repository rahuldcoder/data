@entity0 , @entity1 -- tensions were high friday night around @entity1 , hours after a top @entity1 intelligence official known for his @entity6 stance and at least two others were killed in a massive explosion in normally peaceful neighborhood of @entity0			1
gunfire erupted in the capital and enraged citizens blocked roads after the blast , which left @entity15			1
gen. @entity17 dead and heightened fears that @entity19 's civil war could boil over into neighboring @entity1			1
in @entity21 , people shouted , blocked city streets and burned tires in protest , according to @entity25			0
the friction turned to violence in other spots , including clashes in the seaside @entity1 city of @entity31 between supporters and foes of @entity19 's government			2
@entity35 , a @entity1 opposition leader and former prime minister , told @entity2 that he had no doubt who was responsible for the bloody car bombing : @entity19 president @entity40			1
he accused the @entity19 leader of " killing his own people " and said " he will not think twice " about killing @entity1 in order to protect himself			2
" the message from @entity50 today is anywhere you are , if you are against the regime from @entity1 , we will come and get you , " said @entity35 , who blames the 2005 assassination of his father , former prime minister @entity47 , on @entity19 's government			1
" no matter what you try to do , we will keep on assassinating the @entity1			0
" the blast took place during friday afternoon rush hour in @entity0 's cosmopolitan @entity58 district , a predominantly @entity60 and populous area replete with shops , churches and office buildings			1
the neighborhood is considered among the safest in the city , said @entity66 , who teaches around the block from the attack site			2
the huge blast shattered this peace -- spurring panicked and tearful residents to pour out of their apartments , with some carrying victims to nearby ambulances			2
the bomb 's impact created a crater near @entity78 , tore balconies off apartments , left rows of mangled cars and charred buildings , and shook the windows in @entity2 's offices , about a 10 - minute drive from the scene			1
photos : aftermath of @entity0 blast at least one car was engulfed in flames , blackened wreckage littered the street , and windows were blown out			1
the exact casualty count was unclear : @entity1 's @entity97 said eight people died and more than 90 were injured , but it later amended the figure to at least three deaths and 110 injuries			0
reports said @entity17 was among the dead			0
and a @entity1 political source who did not want to be named told @entity2 it was 99 % confirmed that @entity17 had been killed			0
" there is an unrecognizable body found , and they have found his personal belongings at the scene , " the source said			0
the intelligence official 's killing brought a sense of deja vu to @entity1 , recalling the 2005 assassination of @entity47 , which triggered the end of @entity19 's occupation of @entity1 , and the turmoil that followed			2
gen. @entity17 a pivotal , ' polarizing ' figure @entity120 , the chief of the @entity121 , was a powerful @entity123 figure aligned with a political movement that emerged after @entity47 's assassination and opposes @entity19 's government under @entity40			0
he was also leading an investigation into a @entity1 politician accused of working with two @entity19 officials to plan attacks inside @entity1			2
that former minister and member of parliament , @entity133 , is in jail awaiting trial after being accused of trying to arm and form an armed group to spread sectarian violence in @entity1 by plotting political and religious assassinations			1
two @entity19 security officers also have been charged in the case			2
" unfortunately , today , @entity17 paid the price for his success , " @entity35 said			0
his brother @entity143 , a top party official in the march 14 movement opposition bloc , said in a press conference that he holds @entity1 's government responsible for inadequate security and not doing more to prevent the blast			1
he urged @entity1 prime minister @entity149 and his government to resign immediately			1
@entity149 declared saturday a day of national mourning in decrying the " abominable crime " in a statement			1
but his failure to appear publicly after the explosion elicited criticism , including from one protester in @entity0 who said , " this government is killing us by not doing anything			1
it is not acting like a government			0
it is like a ghost government			0
" human rights groups , foreign governments and world leaders condemned the attack , demanded justice and called for calm in the volatile @entity172 nation			2
@entity175 @entity174 ban ki - moon , for instance , urged " all @entity1 parties not to be provoked by this heinous terrorist act and to maintain their commitment to national unity			0
" the @entity182 militant and political movement @entity180 -- which has a prominent role in @entity1 's government and which the @entity187 government labels a terrorist organization -- also criticized the blast , which it described as a " sinful attempt to target the stability and national unity			1
" @entity19 called the attack a cowardly , " unjustifiable " terrorist act			0
yet some , including @entity35 and @entity196 of the @entity197 , are not convinced , believing @entity50 is responsible either directly or indirectly for the bombing			0
many @entity1 believe @entity40 wants to promote instability in @entity1 and elsewhere to turn attention away from the 19 - month long civil war in his country			0
@entity1 is still recovering from its own 15 - year civil war , which ended in 1990			0
since then , the country has been plagued by assassinations and sectarian tension among @entity207 , @entity182 , @entity60 and others			1
" an event like this can increase the risks of @entity123 - @entity182 conflict in urban centers like @entity0 , " @entity66 said			1
" it could be a harbinger for more instability			0
" @entity2 's @entity217 and @entity218 reported from @entity0			1
@entity2 's @entity219 reported from @entity220			0
@entity2 's @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 and @entity225 contributed to this report .			0
