-- passengers on a @entity3 flight from @entity4 were quarantined at @entity7 's @entity6 airport and later released this weekend over @entity9 fears that turned out to be unwarranted			1
in this case and that of the @entity9 patient in @entity12 , government and our citizens struggle to define the parameters of the sanctioned suppression of individual liberty that is the quarantine			1
in the modern @entity20 , the people boast unparalleled personal freedoms			1
whether enumerated in the @entity23 or " penumbral , " the inalienable liberties of the individual are designed to never be overridden by the interests of the majority			1
unless , of course , you are really , really sick			2
in that case , all those liberty and property rights we talk about ? yeah , not so much			1
government policies of quarantine and isolation raise the classic balancing test of the rights of the individual versus the security of the people			1
nearly every law or regulation can be boiled down to this analysis in one form or another			2
the game changer here is that with an epidemic , the potential harm to the masses is tremendous , so large that it justifies virtually any invasion of individual rights			1
indeed , when one man threatens mankind itself , individual liberties go out the window , and then that window is hermetically sealed			1
and as long as you are not that " one man , " you are fine with that			2
quarantine is perhaps the ultimate invasion of privacy by the state , but constitutionally , it 's an authorized intrusion			0
under the police power granted it by the @entity68 , states can quarantine and isolate a person , property , a geographic area , and even common carriers -- which are trains , buses and airlines			0
some definitions : the difference between quarantine and isolation is that isolation applies to persons who are known to be ill with the contagious disease			1
quarantine applies to people exposed to a contagious disease but who may not actually be sick			1
the @entity3 passengers were only quarantined			1
the state of @entity90 , on the other hand , has exercised its authority to swiftly isolate @entity92 , the @entity93 citizen who is ill with @entity9			1
of course , @entity90 would prefer you use their euphemistic moniker " control measures "			0
see how much less invasive that sounds than " quarantine " or " isolation " ? sometimes government words can sooth government action			0
of course , the authority to quarantine is not unlimited			1
state quarantine statutes are subject to some constitutional constraints			1
the fifth and @entity106 amendments require some " due process " before depriving citizens of constitutionally protected liberty interests			0
in @entity90 , that just means an order			0
not an order obtained from a judicial or democratic process , but a form filled out by the appropriate health official and served on the persons to be isolated or quarantined			2
from there , the state 's power to enforce these control measures is practically limitless and includes criminal penalties			0
there are collateral effects to quarantine and isolation			0
when people are confined to their homes , they are deprived of property rights and the right to earn an income			1
currently only a few states have enacted laws providing any job security to quarantined employees			2
and @entity90 has no requirement that quarantined persons be reimbursed for the consequences of being isolated			2
@entity90 and other courts permit an individual to challenge his or her isolation or quarantine by a petition for a " writ of habeas corpus , " asking a court to declare that the quarantine law is unconstitutional or violates due process			2
courts will defer to the state 's police power and public health decisions unless they are " arbitrary , oppressive and unreasonable			0
" that does n't mean it 's without precedent : if the state can not show good enough reason , some courts have struck down a quarantine			0
while the process may not overall feel very protective of individual rights , contagious diseases force a sobering realization			1
" @entity162 " is ultimately a fluid concept , defined by the circumstances			0
in this case , we balance @entity92 's liberty interests against the governmental interest served by the restraints , and ask whether the measures are reasonably calculated to achieve the government 's aims			0
with the nation whipped up into a fear over ebola - calypse , most people will support the government 's authority to impose these control measures , even when it appears undefined or limitless			2
but the @entity23 is not the only check on the broad state authority to impose control measures			0
state power is ultimately limited by the people ; control measures must have public support and cooperation			2
isolating a single @entity93 is one thing			0
on the other hand , quarantining a population any larger than a cul - de - sac or a passenger jet is going to require a modicum of public support			2
if not , then , no amount of statutory or regulatory authority can prevent a popular revolt , short of the @entity197 , assuming they have n't taken ill too			0
the truth is , we do n't ask about the limits of the quarantine power because we really do n't want to have to find out			0
how far can @entity90 " control measures " go ? more appropriately , how far will we , as citizens , allow them to go ? it raises an interesting legal and moral question , one any fan of the zombie genre has wondered about : if one of our citizens is living but fatally infected , and will harm others if allowed to live out their doomed life , does the state 's broad authority include authority to terminate the infected ? at what point would we be comfortable with that ? in the zombie movies , it 's a no - brainer : generally , as soon as the group knows someone 's infected , execution follows			0
and it 's not always humane			0
do n't think we 're above that in the real world			0
if the life of one threatens millions , does the state 's police power authorize the pre-emptive taking of that one life ? constitution aside , the view of quarantine that we all really hold is one we wo n't admit to : in the case of @entity9 , we endorse any suppression of the rights of the individual ... until that individual is " me "			1
then , we may all become champions of individual rights .			1

@entity243 : people tend to think of constitutional rights as unlimited
in fact , he says , people can be deprived of their liberties if they may carry a contagious disease
passengers on a jet at @entity6 were quarantined until @entity9 was ruled out
@entity243 : rights of the individual can be *subordinated* to those of society as a whole
