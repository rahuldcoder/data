-- health care was a huge topic during wednesday 's presidential debate			1
president @entity4 said the repeal of @entity6 would cause seniors ' prescription drug payments to rise			1
" we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $ 600 , " @entity4 said during his debate with @entity11 challenger @entity10			1
he went on to say that if @entity6 were repealed , " those seniors right away are going to be paying $ 600 more in prescription care			2
" the facts : nearly 5.4 million @entity19 recipients saved more than $ 4.1 billion on prescription drugs as a result of the @entity23 secretary @entity22 said in an august news release			2
" seniors in the @entity19 prescription drug coverage gap known as the ' donut hole ' have saved an average of $ 768 , " she said			1
the law helps make @entity19 prescription drug coverage more affordable			1
complete coverage of @entity0 's @entity33 people with @entity19 can pay a monthly premium for outpatient prescription drug coverage			1
in 2010 , enrollees paid 100 % of their drug costs up to $ 310			0
for costs above that figure , they paid 25 % of the total until that total reached $ 2,800			0
once that figure had been reached , beneficiaries were responsible for the full cost of their drugs until they had spent $ 4,550 -- after which , their share usually dropped to 5 %			0
