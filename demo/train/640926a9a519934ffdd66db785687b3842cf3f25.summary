@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , formally called the @entity3 , is also known as the @entity4 for a good reason			1
@entity1 border guards patrol in @entity7 across from the @entity3 border on march 21 , 2009			1
for decades , it has been shrouded by a veil of secrecy that has prevented us from better understanding this important nation			0
as journalists we seek out the realities of life there , beyond the myths and hype , but that is difficult because the @entity3 is generally inaccessible to journalists			2
the gap between reality and illusion remains profound			0
journalists , such as the two @entity26 being detained in @entity3 , do travel to the border between @entity1 and @entity3 to get a sense of what life is like in the isolated nation of 22 million people			1
the circumstances surrounding the journalists ' arrest are still unclear			0
" @entity3 is such a difficult country to enter for a foreign reporter that the temptation to slip across the frozen river border is considerable , " said former @entity2 correspondent @entity36 , author of " meltdown : the @entity41 of the @entity42			2
" " if that 's what they did , however , it was extremely foolhardy and really pushing their luck			0
" @entity1 and @entity3 share a 1,415 - kilometer ( 880 - mile ) border that mainly follows two rivers			1
the @entity51 defines the border on the northwest , the @entity54 on the northeast			0
by land , the two countries are linked by seven road crossings and four railway points			1
over the years , i have visited three towns on the @entity1 side of the border			1
from a narrow river crossing at the border town of @entity54 , @entity3 cross on foot and in trucks			2
those going back into @entity3 carry bags full of food and household wares , even bicycles			1
some of those coming into @entity1 ferry logs and minerals			2
from across the @entity51 in @entity1 's @entity76 in october of 2006 , i had a glimpse of @entity78 , a @entity3 border town of some 350,000 people			1
using a long camera lens , i saw school children learn to roller skate , and residents celebrating what looked like a wedding			0
still the city 's decrepit appearance hinted at stagnation and isolation			0
it was a stark contrast from the @entity1 city , which was ablaze in neon lights and a bustling commerce and trade			2
@entity3 's public face is one of smiling children , clean streets , manicured gardens , spectacular scenery and a stoic people united under the aegis of @entity104 , known among @entity3 as the " dear leader			2
" i saw it up close twice , in 1996 and 2002 , when i had the chance to visit the most reclusive nation on earth			0
we were typically greeted by polite officials and smiling children and invited to watch spectacular performances with a cast of thousands			0
@entity3 , however , remains isolated , diplomatically and economically , led by an erratic leadership that behaves out of fear and insecurity			1
diplomatic sources in @entity0 suggest that @entity1 is getting fed up with @entity3 's inability to preserve social stability and with its erratic behavior in the multi-national efforts to deal with @entity3 's nuclear program			1
publicly , however , @entity1 sticks to the official line , often calling the two nations ' ties as close as " lips and teeth " -- one can not function without the other			2
in my two visits to @entity3 , i have detected conflicting signs -- one , of social instability and another of a tentative desire to experiment with reforms			1
in 2002 , the government tolerated some quasi-private businesses , raised civil servants ' salaries and deregulated prices of some commodities			0
but much of these tentative efforts to change seem to have been aborted and the country remains isolated and poor			1
what emerges is a nation , now considered a nuclear threat , desperately seeking respect and economic aid			0
that picture is now intertwined with the two detained @entity26 journalists , @entity36 said			0
" it will be interesting to see how the case is handled			0
@entity3 has been in a generally more bellicose mood lately , " said @entity36 , who is currently a senior fellow at the @entity152			2
" the concern is that this incident could get caught up in the bigger picture of heightened tension between the north and the @entity26 and the north and south			0
if it is not swiftly resolved , it will add to the complexity of the situation facing [ @entity26 president @entity163 ] @entity163 , where he is under pressure from @entity165 , @entity166 and some in @entity167 to get tough , while trying to find a way to get diplomacy with the @entity3 going again			0
" in recent years , waves of @entity3 refugees have fled into @entity1 seeking food , jobs and freedom			1
in the border cities of @entity54 , @entity177 and @entity76 , these refugees tell of misery and persecution			0
they live under the protection of relatives , friends and human rights activists			0
here , people speak of a @entity3 " underground railways " -- a network that smuggles desperate people across the border and eventually out of @entity1			1
@entity1 is struggling to keep out the hundreds of @entity3 immigrants and refugees , but stopping the exodus remains a tall order			1
a fundamental solution , analysts suggest , lies not in @entity1 but in @entity3 , where many people are running away from humanitarian disasters and political persecution .			1

secretive and closed off for decades , @entity3 is known as the @entity4
by land , @entity1 and @entity3 are linked by 7 road crossings and 4 railway points
in recent years , @entity3 refugees have fled into @entity1 seeking food , jobs , freedom
tentative reforms have been aborted and @entity3 remains isolated and poor
