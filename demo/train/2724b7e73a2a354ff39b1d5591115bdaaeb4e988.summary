-- @entity3 plans to capture an asteroid and start sending astronauts aloft again by 2017 , even with a tighter budget , the @entity2 space agency announced wednesday			1
the @entity8 administration is asking @entity9 for just over $ 17.7 billion in 2014 , down a little more than 1 % from the nearly $ 17.9 billion currently devoted to space exploration , aeronautics and other science			1
the request includes $ 105 million to boost the study of asteroids , both to reduce the risk of one hitting @entity19 and to start planning for a mission to " identify , capture , redirect , and sample " a small one			1
the plan is to send an unmanned probe out to seize the asteroid and tow it into orbit around the moon , where astronauts would study it			0
" this mission allows us to better develop our technology and systems to explore farther than we ever have before ... to places humanity has dreamed of for as long as i 've been alive , " @entity3 administrator @entity31 told reporters			2
the @entity8 administration has said before that it wants to send astronauts to explore an asteroid by 2025 and to @entity42 by 2030			0
forget falling stars : @entity3 plans to catch an asteroid wednesday 's budget request would include another $ 20 billion to study near - @entity19 asteroids -- doubling the current spending on that effort			1
the funding is aimed not only at finding a suitable asteroid to explore , but also at " protecting the planet , " @entity49 said			2
that concern got new attention after february , when a nearly 150 - foot asteroid passed within 18,000 miles of @entity19			1
that one was expected -- but the same day , an unrelated , 45 - foot space rock plunged into the atmosphere and exploded high over southwestern @entity59 , injuring an estimated 1,200 people			0
@entity62 science adviser @entity61 told a congressional committee in march that as few as 10 % of asteroids more than 150 yards wide -- which he called " potential city killers " -- have been detected			0
@entity3 's budget request includes $ 822 million for the agency 's @entity68 , its push to resume @entity2 space flights through private companies by 2017			1
@entity49 called that the " bottom - line " figure , warning that any cuts would mean delays			0
@entity3 has already hired the unmanned @entity76 to deliver cargo to the @entity78 , though no commercial manned missions are currently under way			2
while putting money into renewed human space flight efforts , the proposal cuts scientific research , particularly the study of the other planets in our solar system			1
planetary science takes a nearly $ 300 million hit compared to 2012 , the last year detailed figures were available			0
@entity3 officials defended the cut , saying major projects like the @entity95 and the upcoming @entity97 probe to study the @entity42 upper atmosphere are already past their most expensive phases			0
" but of course we 'll be ramping up again as we approach 2020 and the next @entity42 rover , " said @entity100 , the agency 's chief financial officer			2
@entity49 said @entity3 's @entity42 research is the biggest part of the planetary science budget			1
