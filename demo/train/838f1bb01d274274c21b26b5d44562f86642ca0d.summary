-- @entity1 , the 57 - year - old winner of this year 's @entity2 -- arguably the world 's most prestigious architecture award -- is the rumpelstiltskin of building design			1
for more than two decades he has taken simple materials , including paper and cardboard , and created life - changing structures for people impacted by natural disasters			1
in the aftermath of the 1995 earthquake in @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity1 built temporary homes for @entity19 refugees using beer crates filled with sandbags			1
in 2011 , after an earthquake and tsunami devastated large parts of @entity16 , @entity1 crafted homes from shipping containers			1
last year he erected a cathedral made out of cardboard paper tubes for the people of @entity30 , @entity31			1
from @entity33 to @entity34 to @entity35 , his low - cost structures become symbols of hope for people rebuilding their lives			1
" for me there is no difference between monumental architecture and temporary structures in disaster areas , " he tells @entity0			1
" they give me the same kind of satisfaction			1
" @entity1 is the second @entity16 artist in a row to win the prestigious award , following on from last year 's winner @entity50			1
@entity51 , chairman and president of @entity54 , which sponsors the @entity2 , said : " he is an outstanding architect who , for twenty years , has been responding with creativity and high quality design to extreme situations caused by devastating natural disasters			1
his buildings provide shelter , community centers , and spiritual places for those who have suffered tremendous loss and destruction			2
" congratulations on winning the @entity2			1
where were you when you heard the news ? i was driving in @entity71 and i got the phone call from [ executive director of the @entity2 ] @entity74			1
since i was on the jury from 2006 to 2009 , i thought she was just joking			2
i had to stop and park the car			2
you 've earned global recognition for bridging the humanitarian and aesthetic aspects of architecture			2
was it really such a surprise that you had won ? honestly , it was a big surprise			2
i did n't expect it			2
as a juror i knew the level of the past winners and i did n't think i was at that level			2
but then it was explained to me that this year the jury considered not only the argument of architecture , but also my activities in disaster areas for 20 years			1
i carry on both activities simultaneously			2
so i thought this was not awarded because i reached a certain level as an architect , but as encouragement for me to continue working in disaster areas as well as designing architecture			1
even more opportunities will now come your way			2
is there a risk this prize could actually distract you from continuing your humanitarian work ? when some people receive a big award there are more opportunities for their projects and to expand their offices			2
i do n't want to make my office bigger			2
i like to design everything by myself and to go to the sites			0
i want to keep working in disaster areas			0
if i get more projects then i can spend less time on each project and i do n't want to lower the quality of each project			0
i think we have to be very careful to keep doing the same things , as we have done			0
how did the idea of working with cardboard come to you ? the strength and durability of a building has nothing to do with the material			1
even a building built in concrete can be destroyed very easily			1
there can be a permanent building made out of cardboard tubes			1
in fact many of my temporary buildings have become permanent			0
when i first used the cardboard tube for the interior i knew this is strong enough to be a part of the structure			1
starchitects tend to devote the bulk of their time to glamorous commissions			0
what drove you to disaster relief ? i was very disappointed about our profession			0
i thought that as architects we could work more for society			0
historically speaking , architecture clients are people who had the money and the power			0
they wanted to visualize power and money with monumental architecture			0
that was the architect 's basic job historically			1
i 'm not saying that is a bad thing			0
i also want to make a monument			0
but i thought we should use our experience and knowledge for the public and victims of natural disasters too			1
i get the same satisfaction when i design a building for a disaster			1
the only difference is i am not paid			0
are there young architects in the pipeline who want to follow in your footsteps ? when i give the lecture i always feel a strong reaction from young architects and students			0
they are interested in working for society and joining my team			0
when i was a student we used to think , " i want to be a starchitect and big developer			0
" the attitudes of young people are changing and i feel that			0
if i have been able to help			0
i think this is my biggest pleasure			0
do you have any advice for those who want to go into " disaster architecture " ? i appreciate when people want to come and join my team and do this work			0
but instead of just working in a disaster area it 's important to travel a lot and to experience different cultures , different climates			0
it 's important for them to be good architects first .			0
