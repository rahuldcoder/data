-- stronger sanctions should have been taken against the @entity2 , according to @entity4 president @entity3 -- who said that " zero tolerance " policies against racism need to be upheld			1
the @entity9 fa was fined $ 105,000 by @entity10 on thursday following an under - 21 match where opposing @entity13 players said they were racially abused			2
the fine was less than the punishment handed to a player at the @entity18 finals for exposing undershorts bearing the logo of a betting company			0
@entity24 soccer 's body also banned two @entity9 coaches and a total of six players from both sides , while also ordering the eastern @entity24 nation to play its next competitive under - 21 match behind closed doors			1
@entity10 was widely criticized , especially in @entity13 , for not taking a stronger stance -- and it was reported in the @entity34 press that president @entity35 might seek to appeal his own organization 's ruling			0
" not only racism , but discrimination has no place in football and there is zero tolerance for it , " @entity3 told reporters at a press conference in @entity40 on saturday			1
" i just learned yesterday what the ( @entity9 ) decision was and i 'm sure we will also take it up with @entity10 at the level of governance , that there should be in all football , with every confederation and all national associations strong , harsh punishment when it comes to racism and discrimination			1
" @entity3 told @entity0 last year that racism on the pitch could be " settled with a handshake " but following the furore those comments caused he has pledged his commitment to battling the problem			1
" i will take up a discussion with the president of @entity10 , but i do n't know if he has an influence on his disciplinary committee , " the 76 - year - old said in @entity68 when asked about the @entity9 - @entity13 case			1
" we will ask for details of the file but i repeat we have it in our organization that there must be very , very strong , strong punishment			0
" in a wide - ranging press conference following friday 's @entity4 executive committee meeting , @entity3 also addressed concerns about security at the @entity84 in @entity85 following the midweek problems at a top @entity88 club match in @entity89			1
the second leg of the @entity92 final was abandoned at halftime after visiting @entity96 team @entity94 claimed they had been threatened with guns by security officials as they left the pitch			0
@entity89 has experienced a drastic rise in crime this year , and @entity85 has boosted its security budget in order to quell concerns that visiting fans will not be safe			0
" such an incident i have to say is also a warning for the organizers in the @entity84 -- a warning for all organizers about what will happen , " said @entity3 , who is in @entity40 for the @entity105 , which climaxes with sunday 's final between @entity85 team @entity107 and @entity24 champions @entity108			1
" security is not a matter of sports organizers , it 's a matter of the authorities , police , army , whatever as we have no power in football to change security , " @entity3 added			2
he said world football 's governing body had given @entity129 soccer authorities a " christmas gift " by agreeing to a new deadline to resolve a two - year power conflict			1
the @entity129 @entity2 ( @entity133 ) is battling for control with the breakaway @entity135 ( @entity136 ) -- a struggle that has been brought to prominence by the death of a @entity141 player who was owed four months ' wages			0
@entity143 died in hospital after contracting an illness , having been unable to return home to his family due to lack of funds after his contract expired			0
" it has been two years now , two years that they have tried to put together the two parts of the football organizations , but they could n't do it , " @entity3 said			2
" they have asked for another three months to be given , until march next year , and also the @entity157 was advocating that			0
i think it was quite a @entity160 gift to @entity129 that they have n't been suspended			2
" they have a league but the players of that league can not play in the national team			0
" since 2011 we have tried to bring together these two different halves of @entity129 football			2
we have given until the next meeting of the @entity172 on the 20th and 21st of march next year to bring their house in order			0
