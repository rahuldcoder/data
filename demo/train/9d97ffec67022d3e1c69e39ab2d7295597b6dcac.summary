-- one of the exhibits at the @entity2 has come to life , literally			1
it 's reminiscent of the wildly popular " @entity5 , " movies , except this is real			2
twenty - four - year - old @entity8 is living at the museum for a month , roaming the large 14 - acre space , exploring every nook and cranny at all hours of the day and night , sleeping where she wants , and basically seeing sights that most people never get to see			1
@entity8 won a " @entity21 " promotional contest , beating out 1,500 other applicants for the opportunity to call the museum home for a few weeks			1
she won based in part on her answer to a question about how a month in a museum could change or transform a person 's life			1
" i 've always loved this museum , and i 've always really loved adventure			1
and i 'm hugely passionate about education , and i saw this as really interesting social experiment and an interesting education - through - social - media kind of experiment , " says , @entity8 , who will get $ 10,000 at the end of her month - long stay			1
@entity38 vice president and chief marketing officer @entity39 concedes that the " @entity5 " movies were part of the whole " whimsy " of the @entity21 promotion			2
" everybody wonders , ' wow , what would i do if i were alone in the museum at night ? where would i go ? what would i see ? what strange things do happen after dark in the museum ? ' " says @entity39			2
@entity8 , who works for a travel company in @entity52 as well as working in local theater , moved into the largest science center in the @entity55 last week			1
she has a couple of private rooms near the museum 's administrative offices and a large , glass cube science office			1
it 's her exhibit display case on the museum 's main level , where she updates her daily online blog and tweets about what she 's learning and seeing			1
" she has unlimited access to every nook and cranny of the museum			2
she can sleep on the @entity72 submarine or in the smart home			0
she can get to all those out of the way places that people ca n't get to , " @entity39 told @entity0			0
her meals are catered , and she can leave the museum as needed for errands or other reasons			2
part of @entity8 's responsibilities for the month require that she mingle with museum guests			1
and she says that 's been a lot of fun			0
she 's become a sort of rock star of sorts , with crowds flocking to the @entity2 to see her and follow her online			1
" i love , love interacting with the school groups that come by			0
they have the best questions , " she says			0
" they 're so inquisitive			0
and just seeing how they react to all the exhibits is so exciting for me			0
" at night , museum staff members are on duty as are the usual security personnel , but in the sprawling complex they may be under the same roof yet not - so - near at the same time			0
" it is a completely different world , " says @entity8			1
" it 's not spooky			0
if anything it 's just a very quick and hard transition from there being so many people -- like on saturday , we had 4,200 people in attendance			0
then to go from that to just the security staff -- it 's a big staff , but it 's also an enormous museum			2
so you can walk around for long periods of time without seeing absolutely anyone			0
i would n't call it scary			0
i would say it is a different kind of experience , maybe a little bit spooky , but nothing to keep me in my room at night			0
" @entity8 does n't have a set schedule of displays or exhibits she plans to explore during her month - long adventure , but she said she does have one very definite must - do before her adventure is over			1
she plans to climb to the top of the museum 's dome to see the sunrise over @entity135			1
@entity8 explains , " i 've found that a key part of this program is trying to find a balance between experience and exploring things , and then interacting with people who are physically at the museum and interacting with people who are in the online community			1
" @entity8 , originally from @entity145 , attended @entity146 in @entity147 and majored in theater			2
she graduated two years ago and has spent time teaching , performing and writing			0
she laughingly jokes , " i 'm not certain if anyone ever had this particular job in mind			0
" @entity8 says the whole experience , so far , has been very overwhelming			2
she 's shot to sudden fame -- she 's getting tweets from people around the country who are following her adventures in the museum			2
" last night i was talking to a woman who said that her daughter , her 7 - year - old daughter , is so into this , she comes home every day and checks to see if i 've made a blog update , " says @entity8			1
" this is day five			0
and she has to tell her daughter that she has to finish her homework before she can read my blog post			0
