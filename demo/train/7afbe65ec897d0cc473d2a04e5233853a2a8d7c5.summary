-- the threat of terrorism , the potential for protest , shoddy accommodation and even a lack of snow			0
just four of the problems faced by organizers of the @entity10 , which came to a glittering conclusion on sunday			2
after 16 days of competition , and a record 98 gold medal events , can @entity13 's first ever @entity12 be labeled a success ? " @entity13 delivered all what it had promised , " said @entity18 ( @entity18 ) president @entity17 in his speech at the closing ceremony			1
" what took decades in other parts of the world , was achieved here in @entity27 in just seven years			1
" it followed comments @entity17 had made in his earlier press conference , when he posed the question : " let 's ask those who criticized the @entity10 if they are ready to change their opinion			2
" with the @entity12 cauldron now extinguished , @entity0 takes a look at whether the country 's $ 50 billion budget was money well spent			1
accommodation when the world 's journalists arrived in @entity27 the readiness of the resort 's accommodation was the subject of widespread coverage and some ridicule			1
broken curtain rails , orange tap water and a shortage of available rooms dominated the pre-games coverage			0
but as the @entity57 arrived in the @entity58 , the reviews became altogether more positive			0
" after five days i have no problems , " @entity13 speed skater @entity59 told @entity0			1
" the accommodation has been great			0
" the village , however , was n't quite as advertised			0
swimming pools were empty as the athletes began filing in and the landscapes around the blocks had not been developed as intended			0
" in the brochure the organizers provided to the teams , this area was meant to be a bird sanctuary , but i do n't think they were able to plant the trees in time , " team @entity69 's short - track speed skater @entity68 told @entity0			2
" but apart from that everything else has been great , " she said			0
@entity18 chief bach applauded the welcome @entity13 had afforded to the @entity57			1
" i spent four nights in different @entity12 villages and had an opportunity to learn the opinions of those sportsmen who are important to me , " he told reporters			1
" none of the athletes uttered a word of complaint to me , " he said			0
and as the @entity10 continued , any accommodation worries went out of the window as athletes became increasingly interested in each other			0
the dating app @entity94 , which matches makes people based on their location , reported a 400 % day - over - day increase of new users in @entity27 at one point during the @entity10			1
some athletes including @entity104 gold medal winner @entity103 even admitted she had to delete the app in order to focus on competition			2
weather would there be enough snow ? would it be too warm ? just two of the questions frequently asked about the weather in sub-tropical @entity27 ahead of @entity13 's first @entity12			1
those fears proved wide of the mark with the conditions largely agreeable over the competition 's two weeks			2
organizers were able to make enough of the white stuff and while a thick fog descended and forced the postponement of biathlon and snowboard cross events , on the whole the competitions were able to take place as planned			2
however , warming temperatures did lead to the deterioration of the halfpipe , the standout event of snowboarding 's @entity12 program			1
before and during the @entity10 , boarders expressed concerns over the condition of the pipe			0
@entity139 , a three - time olympian and a halfpipe gold medal winner in 2006 , was particularly outspoken and even suggested the event be pushed back			2
but it went ahead as planned , despite @entity139 's worries that the conditions prevented boarders from demonstrating the best of their sport			2
sporting success @entity104 's @entity12 debut was the highlight of an @entity152 which showcased extreme winter sports like never before			1
the snowboarders and skiers who took to the snow at the @entity157 captured the imagination of sports fans across the globe			0
the @entity162 dominance of the speed skating events at the newly - built @entity164 , where the @entity162 won eight golds and 23 total medals			2
of 12 gold medals on offer , is also worthy of note			0
but the @entity10 did n't pass without controversy , notably in the women 's figure skating competition			2
the gold medal went to @entity13 's @entity174 , with many dismayed as to why it was n't awarded to @entity178 defending champion @entity177			1
an online petition was started to overturn the result which has so far attracted over two million signatures			0
" the @entity183 ( @entity182 ) is strongly committed to conducting performance evaluations strictly and fairly and has adequate procedures in place to ensure the proper running of the sporting competitions , " said the @entity182			0
" the officiating judges were selected by random drawing from a pool of 13 potential judges			0
all judges in an event represent different @entity182 member federations			0
" the @entity197 ' free skating panel included judges from @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity13 , @entity205 and @entity206			1
and as no official protest was lodged with the @entity183 , the decision stood			0
doping six athletes tested positive for banned substances during @entity212 , most notably @entity214 ice hockey star @entity213			0
that is in contrast to the one positive test recorded during the @entity218 in 2010			0
@entity213 's positive test was announced hours after he played for @entity220 in a 3 - 0 defeat to @entity199 in the gold medal match on the final day of the @entity10			1
@entity224 cross-country skier @entity223 was also chucked out of the men 's 50km , which took place on the final day of the @entity10 , after testing positive for the banned substance @entity228			2
" the number of cases for me is not really relevant , " @entity18 chief @entity17 told reporters on sunday			2
" what is important is that we see that the system works			0
it shows that the @entity18 is serious with zero tolerance because the athletes have been disqualified from the @entity10			0
" terrorism two separate suicide bombings in the city of @entity241 , 420 miles north east of @entity27 , sparked security fears ahead of the @entity12			1
but those fears never materialized			0
@entity13 's " ring of steel " around @entity27 and the increased police presence -- including 400 specially recruited cossack soldiers -- prevented an attack in the region during the @entity10			1
@entity0 's national security analyst @entity249 suggests the calm in @entity13 during @entity212 was due to the @entity251 ( @entity251 )			1
" they have enormous power in @entity13 , " said @entity249			1
" they did a bunch of raids , they locked down villages			0
" they went to organized crime groups , @entity261 in particular , and convinced them -- with money -- to close these people down			0
" the @entity13 , when they want to do a lockdown , know how to do it			1
" protest the @entity10 were n't without protests , most notably by punk rock protest band @entity268			0
a video released last week showed members of the band being beaten by security officials in @entity27 as they tried to record a music video			1
the incident took place one day after two members of the band , @entity279 and @entity280 , as well as journalists and @entity13 human rights activists were held in a police station just miles from the @entity284			1
a prominent @entity203 gay rights activist @entity285 claimed to have been arrested during the games			0
@entity285 , who become @entity288 's first openly transgender parliamentarian when she was elected to the @entity203 chamber of deputies , was allegedly detained after displaying a banner which read " gay is ok " while watching the action in @entity27			1
@entity13 officials said there was no record of her detention			1
" i think it is important ( to have ) the opportunity to talk internationally about these things because otherwise these things happen in @entity13 and nobody knows , nobody cares , " @entity285 told reporters			1
" they think : ' well , it 's not in our country , it 's far away , it 's in @entity13 , who cares ? ' "			1
