@entity0 -- cellphone video captured by two @entity0 - bound @entity4 passengers saturday night portrays the fear of an impending crash and the relief that followed when the pilot averted a catastrophic landing			1
" brace for impact , " a deep voice says on the intercom			2
" heads down ! stay down ! heads down ! stay down ! " a woman commands for more than 30 seconds			2
two passengers aboard flight 4951 from @entity16 , @entity17 , to @entity18 , @entity0 , taped the dramatic moments of their flight 's emergency landing at @entity22 in @entity0			1
the passengers who shot the footage , @entity23 and @entity24 , said monday on @entity1 's " @entity27 " that what first seemed amusing soon turned into a serious situation			1
" while we were circling @entity30 , we circled for a good 20 minutes and we were joking around with each other , saying , ' i do n't know if he knows where the landing strip is , ' and then they made the announcement on the loudspeaker , " @entity24 said			1
" @entity24 was concerned that he was right next to the wing and he got to see the whole thing			2
so we did n't know if there was going to be sparks flying through the window , an engine flying through , " said @entity23			0
the footage from @entity15 shows sparks outside a window of the plane 's cabin			1
the flight experienced landing gear problems , according to a recording of a pilot 's conversation with air traffic control			1
" we have 64 souls on board , " the pilot said , according to @entity55 , which provides audio from air traffic control radio communications			2
" we 've been running all the checklists and talking to our maintenance and approach , our maintenance and dispatcher and we have not been able to get the landing gear down , " the pilot said			1
" our preference would be to proceed over to @entity22 and execute an emergency landing over there ... and if it 's not completely obvious , we just want to confirm , we are declaring an emergency			1
" after the pilot told passengers about the issues with the landing gear , " we 're envisioning belly slide the whole way , with sparks , " @entity23 said			1
" but they actually came out later and said that there were -- it 's only the right rear landing gear that would not come down , so it would be hitting the wing , which is actually what happened			1
" @entity23 said the announcement upset some of the passengers			2
" i saw the lady sitting in front of me who just had tears coming down and she was holding her husband 's hand , " he said			0
" another lady was reaching for a life jacket , saying , ' i ca n't get it			0
' i said ' we do n't need that right now			0
we 're not going into water			0
just listen to the instructions and try to stay calm			0
' " the pilot and an air traffic controller arranged for the plane to land at @entity22			0
" emergency equipment standing by midfield as a precautionary measure , " the air traffic controller said			2
the plane landed safely with no injuries reported			1
" @entity106 was actually quite smooth			0
the pilot did a wonderful job , " @entity24 said			0
" we came down and the plane tipped slightly and the sparks came up ... it was pretty intense , but they did a wonderful job			0
" @entity24 said the landing was " an incredible moment , " with everybody clapping , then hugging and shaking hands after an immediate evacuation			1
in retrospect , the men say the situation was not as dire as their video made it seem			0
" [ the flight attendant heard on the tape ] actually made it more intense than i think it really was			2
but that 's what 's the right thing to do in that situation , " said @entity23			0
he added , " initially , we would say that we survived a plane crash , but it 's kind of -- after it was all finished , i almost hoped it was a little bit more bumpier or something just so we had a cooler story , but we 're just happy to be safe			0
" @entity24 's girlfriend may have been among those most concerned			0
@entity24 drained his phone 's battery taping the incident , so after telling his girlfriend the plane was making an emergency landing , he was unable to call her back			1
he eventually contacted her on @entity23 's cellphone			2
the @entity149 has not released a cause for why the plane 's landing gear malfunctioned			1
