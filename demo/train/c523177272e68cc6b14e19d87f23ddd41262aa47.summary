@entity0 -- the red wave that swept @entity3 into control of the @entity5 led to the defeat of the last white @entity8 @entity7 in the @entity9 on tuesday			1
@entity12 rep @entity10 , a pro-gun , fiscally conservative @entity7 , who was running for his sixth term , lost to @entity16 businessman @entity15			1
the same night that the last white @entity17 serving in the @entity8 lost , @entity18 elected @entity19 , an @entity16 , to the @entity5 in @entity18			0
@entity19 becomes the first @entity20 to be elected in the @entity9 and the first to start a full term since @entity22			2
@entity24 political science professor @entity23 told @entity1 on tuesday that thirty years ago virtually all districts in @entity26 from the deep south were represented by white @entity28 , but with @entity31 's loss " they 've become extinct			1
" @entity33 @entity28 senator @entity32 is in a run off with @entity3 rep @entity35 that will be decided on december 6th			2
related : 9 historic firsts of the @entity3 wave related : @entity19 first black senator elected in @entity9 since reconstruction " @entity28 have fallen about as far as they can , " @entity40 said he noted that @entity3 , who took over @entity42 and state legislatures , redrew @entity8 districts to elect @entity20 @entity28 to represent minority areas , they made the other districts more reliably @entity16			1
also as the moderate and conservative white house democrats from the area retired , or in some cases switched parties , they were replaced by conservative @entity3			2
unless @entity28 take back state houses and can readjust the shape of congressional districts in the deep south , @entity40 said white @entity28 " may be looking at being closed out of @entity26 delegations until the 2030 's			1
" @entity3 have been hoping to knock off @entity10 - who survived the 2010 tea party wave that flipped control of the @entity8 to the @entity3 - for several cycles			2
one senior @entity8 @entity3 campaign strategist admitted that he was one of the toughest incumbents , and a day before the election believed the race was neck and neck			0
but on election night it was n't even close -- @entity31 lost to @entity15 55 % -45 %			0
the @entity12 @entity7 regularly touted his endorsement from the @entity69 , and was well known for his colorful campaign commercials			0
one television spot that @entity31 aired this fall pushed back at charges he was n't going his job			0
it featured a woman who @entity10 helped secure her husband 's veterans benefits , declaring bluntly " anybody who says @entity10 is n't getting things done is lying like a no legged dog			2
" but @entity10 was not conservative enough to keep his seat			1
with his loss the @entity8 delegations of all of the deep southern states - @entity86 , @entity12 , @entity87 , @entity18 and @entity33 - are all composed of @entity3			0
@entity10 frequently criticized the president and voted with @entity8 republicans repeatedly on measures to repeal parts of @entity93			0
but the @entity94 targeted @entity31 with an ad saying he voted with the president 85 % of the time			0
@entity8 @entity28 aides said @entity31 's loss demonstrates just how heavy the weight of president @entity101 was around @entity28 candidates			0
" if anybody could win in the deep south , it 's @entity10 , " one of these senior @entity8 @entity28 leadership aides told @entity1			1
the loss is also a warning sign for @entity8 @entity28 whose caucus is dominated by liberal members representing mostly urban areas in blue states			1
when they captured the @entity8 in 2006 , @entity28 recruited moderate candidates not only in red districts in the @entity9 , but also in rural districts in @entity117 , @entity118 , and in @entity120 states like @entity121 and @entity122			1
@entity28 realize that if they want to regain the majority they will need to reach out to more centrist @entity28 again			0
" we can ' just cede the @entity9 forever			0
we 've got to come up with some type of strategy and look at our policies and figure out how speak to those voters in those districts , " this @entity28 aide said .			1

the @entity9 was once dominated by @entity28 , but they are now an *endangered* *species* there
congressional districts have been drawn to *emphasize* minority votes in some areas and conservative votes elsewhere
rep. @entity10 was the last white @entity28 congressman representing the @entity9
