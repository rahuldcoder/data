soccer enjoyed an upsurge in popularity in the @entity2 off the back of the team 's showing in @entity32 , which saw @entity7 's team finish second in its group and suffer an agonizing extra-time defeat to @entity36 in the round of 16			1
the performances of players like goalkeeper @entity40 and team captain @entity41 during the tournament made them household names in their homeland and @entity7 hopes more players can achieve such recognition			1
thousands of @entity2 soccer fans also travelled to @entity32 to support their team			2
" the @entity2 is a very fast - growing soccer market , " insisted the 50 - year - old , who has coached the team since 2011 and recently signed a contract extension until 2018			1
" there is a young professional league coming up ... the youth system is getting better and better , there is a lot of education that will be done over the next years			0

it 's something you can have a handle on and that is what i really enjoy			2
" earlier this week @entity69 president @entity68 outlined a number of changes to the federation 's youth set up as it seeks to align its " technical practices with the best in the world			0
" notably @entity69 is to introduce three extra age groups for its teams			0
" beginning in the @entity81 of 2016 , @entity69 will add an under - 12 age group to the @entity84 program , " said @entity69 statement			0

" prior to signing a contract with @entity2 soccer , @entity7 coached his native @entity97 -- guiding the country during its hosting of the 2006 @entity23 -- before enduring a testing period in charge of his former club @entity102			1
but he has long held affinity for the @entity2 , dating back to playing for @entity97 during the @entity69 ' 94 @entity23 and vacations he took prior to his appointment as the country 's football coach			1

" they respect you no matter what you are trying to do			0
" i ended up in @entity122 meeting an @entity2 girl and getting married to a wonderful @entity2 wife , and then we had to settle the family in either @entity122 or the @entity2 " so step - by - step i 've been through that process and ended up in the coaching world			2
" however @entity7 's tenure has not been without controversy the 50 - year - old riled @entity133 ( @entity133 ) commissioner @entity132 earlier this year by suggesting @entity41 and fellow midfielder @entity131 had potentially damaged their careers by deciding to leave @entity122 clubs and move to @entity133			1
@entity132 slammed @entity7 's comments as damaging to the league -- which recently concluded its 19th season with @entity140 beating @entity141 in the championship game			2
but despite the continued growth of @entity133 -- @entity132 hopes it will expand from the current 19 teams to 24 by 2020 -- @entity7 is eager to continue @entity147 's soccer " education			1
" " i think a lot of people in the @entity2 have n't connected the dots yet , " he said			2
" there is a lot of knowledge out there but knowledge is spread all over the place			0
" our job will be in the next couple of years to educate parents , educate players , educate a lot of coaches out there , in order to catch up with the best in the world			0
" going forward we want to raise the bar and we want to go further in a @entity23			2
