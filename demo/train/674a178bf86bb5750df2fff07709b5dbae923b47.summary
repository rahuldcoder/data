have confirmed they will vehemently oppose a new move by a supporters ' association to bring back standing at football matches			1
following the 1989 @entity8 disaster , when 96 @entity10 fans were crushed to death on terracing , it was made law in @entity14 for all top - flight stadiums to be made all - seater -- although terraces are still common place in the lower divisions			1
however , many supporters believe that the banning of standing up at football grounds has resulted in the atmosphere becoming diluted -- prompting the 180,000 - member @entity23 ( @entity23 ) to launch an online petition calling for the return of standing areas in the top division			2
speaking to the official @entity1 website , @entity1 spokesman @entity29 said : " our view is that the benefits of all - seater stadia far outweigh the return of standing areas			1
" they have led to more women and children attending the games and , no matter how safe standiing can be made , seating is always safer			0
we will not be encouraging the government to change the law , " he added			0
the @entity23 held a meeting on monday with representatives from the police , the @entity43 and footballing authorities , with their chairman @entity49 arguing that many fans still stand up despite having a seat			0
however , @entity61 sport 's minister @entity60 told the meeting : " should we return to terracing , then the first time there is any significant crowd trouble , or an accident , the minister 's head would be on a spike at @entity58 before he could draft a resignation letter ! " the @entity23 has cited the @entity65 @entity64 , where terraces are widespread , resulting in packed stadia and cheaper tickets , as a good example of how standing can be safer at matches			2
standing is also still very much evident in @entity73 and @entity74 , where the most fervent supporters adorn their own respective terraces in club colours , making for a noisy , passionate , and at times , intimidating atmosphere .			0

the @entity1 oppose a petition to bring back standing at matches
the @entity23 want to see terracing return to top flight games
