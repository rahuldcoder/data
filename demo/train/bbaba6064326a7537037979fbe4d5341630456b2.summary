@entity0 -- launching off a 300 - meter - high tower platform with only seconds to pull your rip cord might sound like the act of an insane person			1
but that 's exactly what 103 base jumpers from 20 countries -- presumably all of sound mind -- did in @entity13 over the weekend			1
the jumps were part of the annual @entity16 jump 2013 , held in @entity0 from september 27 to 30			1
@entity17 , 32 , a location manager from the @entity18 , was one of six women jumping this year			2
" a lot of people do say i 'm crazy but my family is pretty supportive , " she said			2
" jumping can be scary , but when you calm your nerves and become quiet it 's very peaceful out there , meditative			2
base jumping can be solitary but this is such a social event , it 's great			1
" this year 's jump also welcomed @entity31 from the @entity18 , a pioneer in tandem base jumps , and @entity34 , a paraplegic base jumper from @entity36			1

" unfortunately his accident was caused by base jumping , but he highlights how if one avenue closes you focus on what you can do			1
@entity34 has been able to do some pretty amazing stuff			0
" @entity49 has been organizing the @entity0 event since 2005 and has around 2,900 jumps under his belt			0
he said if you want to try base jumping , start by skydiving			1
" through skydiving you learn precision falling and how to handle parachutes			1
you also learn how to deal with things when they go wrong			0
the potential risk is very real			0
" @entity62 's worst pick - up line ? with risk comes reward -- the ultimate adrenalin buzz			1
but you 'd be mistaken to assume that saying you 're a base jumper works as a pick - up line			1
" it does n't help you pick up women , it helps you lose them actually , " said @entity68 , 33 , a junior doctor from @entity40			0
" women tend to see base jumpers as not a particularly secure future			1
who wants to have babies with someone who is committed to tracking down a 4,000 foot wall ? " the point was echoed by @entity78 , 24 , from @entity79			0
" some women say they 're scared of the sport , but then i do also spend all my time and money on base jumping ! " ' 100 % of people who drink bottled water die ' base jumping is dangerous			1
from 1981 to the present there have been more than 200 fatalities related to the sport			0
the base jumping community tries to minimize risks			2
in order to leap from the @entity96 , which opened in the @entity13 capital in 1996 , jumpers need to have two years of experience and more than 120 jumps under their belt			2

" it 's not about having [ guts ] , it 's about arming yourself with knowledge -- risk management is key , " he said			0
" we accept what we do is dangerous but we want to see everyone walk away safely			0
one hundred percent of people who drink bottled water die			0
if you accept that you will die you get on with living			0
base jumpers focus on the positive			1
" insane ? " @entity132 , " " mad " and " nuts " were adjectives hurled at jumpers by spectators attached to the tower 's ledge with safety harnesses , as they looked over the edge and snapped photos			2
" we did n't realize the festival was going on , " said @entity135 tourist @entity134 , standing on the open deck of the tower watching jumpers leap			1
" we were just sat in @entity141 's and saw someone fall off the tower -- we thought they 'd jumped , " added her partner , @entity145			0
" thankfully we saw them pull the parachute			0
that was an experience in itself and then we came up here to see it			0
it feels better to watch than to do it yourself			0
