-- the future is " girl			1
" imagine girl is a cell that each of us -- boys and girls -- are born with			1
imagine this girl cell is central to the evolution of our species and an assurance of the continuation of the human race			1
now imagine that a few powerful people , invested in owning this world , understood that the oppression of this cell was key to retaining their power , so they reinterpreted this cell , undermining its value and making us believe that it is weak			1
they initiated a process to crush , eradicate , annihilate , humiliate , belittle , censor , reduce and kill off the girl cell			1
imagine girl is a chip in the huge microcosm of our collective consciousness , which is essential to the balance , wisdom and future of humanity			1
imagine that girl is the part of each of us that feels compassion , empathy , passion , intensity , association , relationship , emotion , play , resistance , vulnerability , intuitive intelligence , vision			1
imagine that compassion informs wisdom			1
that vulnerability is our greatest strength			0
that emotions have inherent logic and lead to radical saving action			0
now remember that those in power essentially taught us and conditioned us to believe the opposite : compassion clouds your thinking			2
emotions are not to be trusted			0
do n't take things personally			0
to be a boy means not to be a girl			2
to be a man means not to be a girl			2
to be strong means not to be a girl			2
to be a woman means not to be a girl			2
to be a leader means not to be a girl			2
it must be very powerful to be a girl if everyone is taught not to be one			2
having traveled the planet for 12 years , visiting more than 60 countries and living in the rape mines of the world , i have been with girls			1
i have witnessed their realities			0
i have seen girls with knife wounds and cigarette burns , treated like garbage , beaten by their brothers and fathers and boyfriends and mothers , starving themselves to death to look the way they are supposed to look -- which is close to invisible			0
we are so accustomed to prohibiting girls from being the subjects of their own life that we have turned them into objects : commodities in the marketplace , bodies to be bought and sold and plundered and married off or raped in war			0
buying a girl is cheaper than buying a cow in many places			0
i have been with boys as well , watched as they have been ridiculed , censored and abused for their tenderness , their doubts , their grief , their need for comfort and protection			0
i have seen how the tyranny of masculinity has forced boys and then men to cut off their hearts and cast them into a brutal , lonely state of disassociation and isolation			0
the state of girl , the condition of girl -- in the world and in us -- will determine if this species survives			1
i believe unleashing the intensity of girl , the outrage of girl , the passion of girl , is the only way to chip away the thick sludge of denial , oppression and indifference that has led to our insane acceptance of a world spinning us toward our end			1
what i have witnessed across this planet is the wild natural resiliency , fierceness , grace and nobility of girl			0
the girl cell is our greatest resource , a renewable , untapped energy field like the wind			0
it is there for us , if we activate it and allow it to resist , dare , challenge , feel and connect			0
