@entity0 , @entity1 -- the hottest ticket in town these days is for the who 's @entity6 and more tour concert on tuesday night at the @entity8 in downtown @entity0 , @entity1			1
it will be the first time @entity10 will see them live , and she 's anxious			0
after all , @entity12 is her favorite band , and she purchased her ticket more than 33 years ago			1
" i 've waited a long time for this , " she told @entity2			0
@entity10 was 18 in december of 1979 when it was announced that @entity12 's @entity18 would be coming to @entity1			1
the then teenager spent three days scouring ticket outlets and record stores to get her seat			2
@entity23 will also be at the concert tuesday night			2
he 's been waiting for this since his freshman year in college , when the self - described " who fanatic " stood in line overnight outside of the @entity8 ( now the @entity8 ) for his two tickets ; one for him and one for his date -- his kid sister @entity28			2
" i wrapped up the night shift at @entity35 and ran across the street to the @entity37 , " he remembered			0
" i spent all of the money i had -- $ 25			0
" the who show was a big to - do in little @entity1 ; the concert was a sell - out			1
but @entity12 never showed up			1
just weeks before the scheduled @entity1 show , 11 fans were trampled to death at a @entity12 concert in @entity48			1
it was an incident that forever altered festival style seating at rock concerts			0
in the aftermath , then - @entity0 mayor @entity53 ' " @entity52 , who oversaw the @entity8 auditorium , canceled the show			1
his decision disappointed and enraged @entity12 fans in @entity0			1
" i wanted ( mayor @entity52 ) impeached ! " @entity23 said			0
" i cried for days , " said @entity10 , who still bristles at the mere mention of the name @entity61			0
but even though @entity0 was the only show to be canceled after the tragedy , @entity52 still stands by his decision			1
" did i take heat ? sure i did , " the mayor - turned - talk show host told @entity2			2
" i got plenty of hate mail over it			0
but do i regret it ? not at all			0
" in the 33 years since the canceled show , the who have never played a show in @entity1 despite numerous overtures made by the arena , according to @entity8 officials			1
they have , however , played more than a dozen times at numerous nearby venues in @entity79			0
but for those thinking that the reason for the decades - long absence from the @entity1 was due to a grudge against the arena or @entity52 , think again			0
" i think the mayor of @entity0 made an informed decision at the time , " @entity12 guitarist @entity85 said in a statement to @entity2			1
" it was based on what he knew			0
" left heartbroken and bitter , @entity10 and @entity23 nevertheless always held onto those tickets			2
ball , now a retired drill sergeant living in @entity95 , kept his pair in a green shoe box that he took with him to the 16 places the @entity99 moved him throughout his career			0
@entity10 , now 51 and an accountant , kept hers in a scrapbook of news clippings about the tragedy in @entity48			2
when the @entity8 announced last summer that @entity12 would finally be coming back , general manager @entity106 -- a former @entity0 cop who was coincidentally assigned to work the ' 79 show -- decided to right a 33 - year - old wrong			1
anyone with a ticket to the ' 79 show would be admitted			1
" i think it 's a wonderful gesture , " @entity85 told @entity2			0
turns out , @entity10 and @entity23 were not alone			0
thirty - two tickets from 1979 with face values of $ 11.50 and $ 12.50 were exchanged for the $ 129.50 seats being sold today			1
one of those tickets belongs to @entity23 's sister , @entity28			2
she was in the 11th - grade at the time of that canceled date with her brother and the @entity12			1
on tuesday , she turns 50			0
@entity106 says it would take a catastrophic act of @entity124 for the arena to cancel the show this time around , but @entity23 and @entity10 are n't taking any chances			2
and like that famous song by @entity12 , they 're praying that they wo n't get fooled again .			1
