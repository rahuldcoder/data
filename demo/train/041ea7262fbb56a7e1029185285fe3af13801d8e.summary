@entity0 presses a key on the enormous @entity4 organ console in front of him and a police siren wails across the cinema stage			1
a second key brings the sound of tweeting birds , and another the clopping sound of horse hooves , as if someone is standing off - stage with a pair of coconut shells			0
then he flexes his fingers , leans in to the array of keyboards and launches into a cheery rendition of " @entity22			0
" the organ 's pipes throb , sing and trill with the power of a full orchestra			1
were if not for for the fact @entity0 is wearing jeans and a plaid shirt , we could be transported back to the early 1940s , when the @entity32 organ was in its heyday at the @entity34 -- an immaculately preserved art deco cinema in the heart of @entity37			1
the @entity34 was an opulent masterpiece when it opened in the 1920s -- its owner , @entity40 , took pains to equip it with the best organ his money could buy			1
a @entity46 immigrant originally from @entity47 , @entity40 was killed along with his family in a @entity50 concentration camp during the @entity51 and his cinema renamed the @entity53			2
after the war it reverted to its original name and in the 1980s benefited from an expensive restoration project that returned much of its original grandeur			0
fascination with insects today it 's a fully functioning three - screen film theater operated by @entity63 cinema chain @entity62			1
the @entity64 regularly rolls out the red carpet for movie stars as the location for most major premieres in the @entity69			0
the lushly decorated lobby and grand hall -- with elaborate fixtures and decorations said to be inspired by @entity40 's fascination with insects -- are impressive enough , but the cinema 's star attraction is its @entity4 organ			1
it 's still capable of producing rich sounds , largely thanks to the efforts of a team of volunteers from the @entity84 , who use mechanical ingenuity to keep the instrument going			1
" when we first took her apart , she was in a very bad condition , " said @entity88 , a 55 - year - old computer programmer who worked on a project to restore the organ with @entity0 , a 67 - year - old piano tuner , bookkeeper @entity92 , 76 , and other volunteers and technicians			2
" it 's taken us many , many years to fix her up and get her working properly again			2
we 're not professionals , but we 've learned by doing it every day			0
" as @entity0 continues playing , @entity88 and @entity92 take great pride in crossing the main stage ( once graced by visiting stars @entity104 and @entity106 ) and leading the way down to a series of cramped rooms where the organ 's innards vibrate to its mighty sounds			1
a mechanical wooden bellows wheezes to fill the musical pipes with rushing air			2
automated percussion instruments boom and clash			0
old boots springs and air tubes the organ is in immaculate order but , says @entity92 , some of the machinery has been cobbled together from odds and ends			1
" you can not go to any store to buy the things the organ needs , they 're not made any more , " he says			2
" instead , we have to produce them ourselves out of old boots , springs and air tubes			0
" @entity88 points to a series of glass - windowed wooden cabinets that house the organ 's main circuitry			1
it would 've been simpler to tear them out and replace them with a modern computer processor , he explains , but the team preferred to recreate the original electrics			1
" it was a challenge for us , " he says			0
" but in 100 years someone will easily be able to fix this , and they wo n't be able to find the microchips they need to mend the computers			0
" wanted : young helpers the volunteers still spend hours every week maintaining the organ , but time is limited because the cinema hosts a full program of movie screenings			1
although the enthusiasm of @entity165 and @entity0 is as strong as ever , their advancing age means they need to find and train a new generation volunteers to keep the organ sounding its best			2
the @entity4 still pulls in admirers			0
@entity0 gives regular performances to parties of schoolchildren and groups on the twice - daily guided tours of the @entity34 , as well as special cinema events including screenings of the silent films it was originally installed to accompany			1
the organ and theater also occasionally attract members of a dwindling group of @entity4 maestros -- including @entity184 and @entity185 and @entity187 's @entity186			1
" there 's always applause			2
it 's a great privilege for all of us to play , " says @entity92			0
" she 's an old lady			0
you have to be careful with her , but you also have to play her because if you do n't , she will start to fail			0
