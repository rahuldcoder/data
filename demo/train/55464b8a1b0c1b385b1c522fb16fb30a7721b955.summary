-- @entity3 president @entity2 's government and the opposition demanded independent investigations wednesday into countering accusations of the use of chemical weapons , allegations that prompted most members of the @entity11 to call for a probe			1
the demands , made in writing to the @entity14 , came a day after the government and the rebels accused one another of using chemical weapons in fighting in the flashpoint province of @entity20 and a rural suburb of the @entity3 capital of @entity23			1
even as both sides accused the other of using such weapons , the @entity25 ambassador to @entity3 and other officials said there was no evidence to substantiate the reports			1
" so far , we have no evidence to substantiate the reports that chemical weapons were used yesterday , " ambassador @entity33 told the @entity34			1
" but i want to underline that we 're looking very carefully at these reports			0
we are consulting with partners in the region and in the international community			0
" @entity33 , who was pulled from @entity3 when the @entity25 closed its embassy in @entity23 more than a year ago , said he was " skeptical " of @entity45 reports that the rebel @entity46 had used chemical weapons			1
competing calls for investigations throughout the civil war , which began in 2011 , it has been difficult for the international community to determine the validity of claims by both sides of violence and casualties because access to the country has been severely restricted by the @entity3 government			1
even so , the @entity14 confirmed wednesday it was studying a written request received from @entity3 government officials , who were calling for a neutral party to investigate their claim			2
a majority of the members of the @entity11 plan to send a letter to @entity69 ban ki - moon to request an inquiry to " shed light " over the reports , said @entity73 , the @entity74 ambassador to the @entity14			1
he made the comments after wednesday 's closed - door meeting of the @entity11			2
the letter asks @entity78 to conduct a " swift , thorough and impartial " investigation , @entity80 , the @entity81 's deputy ambassador to the @entity14 , said			1
@entity80 described the @entity3 government 's demand as a request for a narrow investigation , looking into only one alleged incident			2
" the way in which they have framed the request prejudges the outcome of the investigation by alleging it 's the opposition that is responsible for that case of use of chemical weapons , " he said			1
the @entity11 is calling for a broader investigation			2
the rebels ' coalition government , meanwhile , demanded an international investigation and called for a delegation to visit the sites of the alleged attacks			0
military analysts believe the @entity3 government may have one of the largest stockpiles of chemical weapons in the world			1
specifically , the supply is believed to include sarin , mustard and vx gases , which are banned under international law			0
@entity3 has denied the allegation			2
the use of chemical and biological weapons are banned under the @entity117			2
@entity3 is not one of the 188 signatories to the convention , which bans the production , stockpiling and use of chemical weapons			1
in recent months , reports have repeatedly surfaced that @entity3 forces moved some of the chemical weapons inventories possibly because of deteriorating security in the country , raising fears the stockpile could fall into the hands of @entity134 - linked groups working with the opposition should @entity2 's government fall			1
as a result , the @entity25 has been talking with neighboring countries about the steps needed to secure the weapons stockpile should @entity2 be forced from office			2
meanwhile , @entity25 president @entity142 on wednesday reiterated his warning to @entity3 's government that it would be held accountable for the use of chemical weapons " or their transfer to terrorists			1
" " we intend to investigate thoroughly exactly what happened , " @entity142 told reporters during a joint news conference in @entity152 with @entity154 prime minister @entity153			0
the president said he was " deeply skeptical " of @entity3 government claims that the opposition used chemical weapons			1
@entity142 has previously said @entity3 's use of chemical weapons would cross a " red line			1
" " we have been very clear to the @entity2 regime -- but also to other players on the ground -- that a red line for us is , we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized , " he told reporters			1
" that would change my calculus ; that would change my equation			0
" intelligence agencies pore over the evidence intelligence officials around the world were investigating the accusations , @entity25 officials told @entity0 on wednesday			2
investigators were talking to rebels and defectors , poring over medical intelligence regarding symptoms reported by doctors and looking at satellite imagery used to track missiles launched and chemical weapons movements , the officials said on condition of anonymity			1
they were not authorized to release details to the media			0
a spokesman for @entity153 , @entity195 , told @entity0 that @entity154 officials had no confirmation that chemical weapons had been used			2
but @entity195 's comments did not square with those of @entity154 justice minister @entity201			0
" it is clear for us here in @entity154 " that chemical weapons have been used in @entity3 , and an international response should be on the table , @entity201 told @entity0 in an exclusive interview from her home in @entity204			1
@entity201 would n't say whether there is evidence the @entity3 government has directed the use of any chemical weapons			1
but she said the development would pose a direct threat to @entity154 , which shares a border with @entity3			2
their concerns centered on an attack tuesday in @entity221 in the northern province of @entity20			0
state - run media blamed rebels for the attack , which it said killed 25 people and injured more than 110 others			0
rebels say they have no chemical weapons on wednesday , @entity3 's @entity14 ambassador , @entity230 , said the @entity3 government has asked @entity69 ban ki - moon to open an investigation into the alleged use of chemical weapons by " terrorist groups , " which is how the government refers to rebels			1
but the opposition @entity46 said rebels do n't have access to chemical weapons and blamed the casualties on a government missile			2
separately , an opposition group said the government attacked the rural @entity23 suburb of @entity246 with " chemical rockets , " causing an unspecified number of deaths along with cases of suffocation , nausea and hysteria			0
there was no immediate government response			0
the reports ignited a firestorm of reactions , with @entity45 slamming the rebels and some @entity25 lawmakers saying that @entity261 might need to take action against the @entity3 government			2
observers : images are not consistent with a chemical weapons attack but images posted by @entity3 state - run media of the aftermath of the @entity20 incident , which the government blamed on rebels , are not consistent with a chemical weapon attack , some observers said			1
" there are no images of the site of the attack ; just of some affected people			0
these people do not show outward symptoms of a @entity283 ( chemical weapon ) attack			0
definitely not mustard ; definitely not a nerve agent , " wrote @entity284 , senior research fellow at the @entity285			0
" there are far too many people , including non-medical staff , around the affected persons			0
apart from a surgical mask , nobody wears any protective garment or gas masks			0
if there would have been a @entity283 attack with one of the agents known ( or believed ) to be in @entity3 's arsenal , then most of the people present would have been fatally or seriously contaminated			0
" he added that , during the @entity305 uprisings , witness reports cited chemical attacks , but none had been confirmed			0
" people are exposed to a wide range of toxicants in today 's battlefield , " he said in an e-mail			0
" furthermore , once a rumor gets around , people are more likely to think that they suffer from symptoms similar to the ones being rumored			0
" @entity317 : what 's @entity3 's chemical weapon potential , and what are the health risks ? not the first round of claims @entity25 officials pointed to previous claims that the @entity3 government used chemical weapons , which were found to be false after extensive investigation			1
the @entity3 government did not use chemical weapons against residents of @entity333 in a december attack , a @entity330 investigation showed , but did apparently misuse a riot - control gas in the incident , according to senior @entity25 officials			1
the officials said the @entity330 launched a probe from its consulate in @entity340 , @entity341 , after reports from doctors and activists that dozens of people suffered nervous system , respiratory and gastrointestinal ailments after inhaling the gas in @entity333 on december 23			0
the civil war -- which began two years ago after a government crackdown on @entity3 protesters -- has left around 70,000 people dead and uprooted more than 1 million others , the @entity14 has said			0
@entity0 's @entity355 , @entity356 , @entity357 , @entity358 , @entity359 and @entity360 contributed to this report .			0
