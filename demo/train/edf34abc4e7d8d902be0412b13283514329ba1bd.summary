it 's proving to be a roller - coaster ride for @entity3 at this year 's @entity4			1
after the heartache of conceding a last - minute winner against @entity8 in its opener , ecstasy has followed with the @entity3 stealing all three points at the death in their second @entity13 match against tournament favorite @entity14			1
following 91 minutes of a game of football that had very little to show for it , @entity19 -- back for @entity3 after a bout of malaria -- was on hand to keep his nation 's dream of a first @entity4 title in 33 years alive			1
despite a poor showing , but for a handful of minutes at this tournament , @entity28 's men will take heart from beating the competition 's highest - ranked team -- the last time it defeated @entity14 in the @entity4 , it went on to win the whole thing in 1982			1
the result means @entity3 is now level on points with @entity14 but leapfrogs the @entity39 nation into @entity13 's second qualifying spot due to its superior head - to - head record			1
the day 's late game between @entity43 and @entity8 ended 1 - 1 , leaving @entity13 very tight -- @entity43 sit top , one point ahead of @entity3 and @entity14 , with bottom - placed @entity43 a further two points adrift			1
@entity3 's chances of a victory against @entity14 did not look quite so bright at halftime , however , following a cagey , scrappy 45 minutes bereft of any real quality , with the @entity3 desperate not to lose and the @entity14 happy with a draw			2
given that it was pretty much a must - not - lose affair for @entity3 in @entity53 , @entity54 , jangling nerves were perhaps to be expected			2
and they certainly had their wicked way in the first half , with a poor touch from @entity60 in @entity3 's goal almost handing @entity62 the opener on a plate , only for the keeper to recover in time			2
@entity14 , equally , struggled to make an impact , lacking the enthusiasm going forward it showed in last summer 's @entity68 , though it did come closest to scoring in a drab first half through @entity70 , who fired wide an @entity72 delivery			0
@entity3 appeared a somewhat different team after the break , perhaps realizing that three points might be vital towards ensuring a first @entity4 group - stage exit since 2006 is avoided			1
@entity19 first went close , heading an @entity77 cross agonizingly wide , while @entity78 and @entity79 also had chances -- the older sibling heading over after his younger brother had earlier fired a flicked effort off target			0
inspired by its opponent , @entity14 also picked up its performance going forward , resulting in a rather more open second 45 minutes			0
one constant from the first half , however , remained -- a lack of quality in the final third			0
that was until a shattered @entity19 latched onto a long ball forward over the top deep into stoppage time and picked out the bottom corner			2
" @entity19 is a great player with a fantastic attitude			0
he was ill but he played the 90 minutes and scored at the end , " @entity28 told @entity98 's official website following his first competitive win as @entity3 coach			2
" he is a great player but also a great personality			0
but it 's not just the victory of one player			0
it 's the victory of a whole team			0
" the second match at @entity53 saw @entity43 and @entity8 play out a far more entertaining affair , with the second half coming alive after an uninspiring opening 45 minutes			1
although eventually succumbing to a 3 - 1 defeat against @entity14 monday , it was @entity43 that started the brighter and took the lead on that occasion -- and it was similar for the @entity43 this time around			1
the 1996 champion was the more threatening team in the first half and came out of the blocks firing after the restart as @entity122 converted a cross from the right into the bottom corner of the net with an excellent first - time finish			0
@entity8 , insipid in attack up to that point , was soon awoken and thought it had found an equalizer through @entity131 shortly after , only for the goal to be disallowed due to offside			0
minutes later , though , and the @entity133 of @entity134 had leveled , with @entity135 rising highest to head home @entity138 's free - kick past the stranded @entity139			0
with momentum on its side , it was @entity8 who looked the more likely to score another , attempting to replicate monday 's comeback victory over @entity3			2
this time , however , there was to be no last - minute winner for @entity149 's side , yet it still had the consolation of ending the evening sitting atop @entity13			1

@entity3 beats @entity14 1 - 0 with last - minute winner from @entity19
@entity19 was back in the @entity3 team after recovering from bout of malaria
win keeps @entity3 hopes of first @entity4 triumph in 33 years alive
@entity8 draws 1 - 1 with @entity43 to move top of @entity13
