@entity2 @entity1 leaders announced their intention wednesday to pass a bill this week that would only keep the government running after september 30 if president @entity7 's health care reform law is fully defunded			1
the decision sets up a high stakes game of political chicken over the next 12 days , as @entity11 have repeatedly rejected any attempt to undo the president 's signature legislative achievement			0
" we 're going to continue to do everything we can to repeal the president 's failed health care law , " said @entity2 speaker @entity15 , @entity16			0
" the law is a train wreck			0
" " we aim to put a stop to @entity26 before it costs one more job or raises a family 's out - of - pocket expenses one more dollar , " said @entity2 majority leader @entity23 , @entity24			2
the @entity2 bill , which would keep the government running through mid-december , also locks in overall funding levels at $ 986 billion , preserving @entity34 's so - called " sequester " -- forced across - the - board spending cuts that have been criticized by leaders on both sides of the aisle			1
@entity26 , spending showdown heats up in @entity2 most congressional democrats , opposed to further cuts in non-defense spending , have expressed their strong opposition to such a move			1
in addition , the @entity1 bill states that @entity48 and disability payments need to receive top priority if @entity50 and the president are unable to raise the federal debt ceiling by mid-october			1
a failure to extend the nation 's borrowing limit and pay bills already incurred risks an unprecedented national default			0
@entity7 and other @entity59 leaders have warned they will not cave to @entity1 demands for new spending cuts in exchange for a hike in the debt limit			1
" i 'm happy to negotiate with ( congressional @entity1 ) around the budget , just as i 've done in the past , " @entity7 told business leaders on wednesday			1
" what i will not do is create a habit , a pattern , whereby the full faith and credit of the @entity73 ends up being a bargaining chip to set policy			0
" the president told his audience to " flip the script for a second and imagine a situation in which a @entity59 speaker said to a @entity1 president , ' i 'm not going to increase the debt ceiling unless you increase corporate taxes by 20 percent			1
and if you do n't do it , we 'll default on the debt and cause a worldwide financial crisis			0
' " " that ca n't be a recipe for government , " he said			1
a less confrontational strategy initially backed by @entity1 leaders unraveled last week			0
government shutdown : again ? seriously ? numerous @entity98 threatened to defeat a temporary spending measure proposed by their leadership because it did not directly link continued government funding with a ban on money for the new health care law			1
conservative groups such as @entity107 and @entity108 praised the harder line now adopted by @entity15 and other @entity1 leaders			0
" @entity11 and president @entity7 must make a decision : shut down the government to protect a destructive , unpopular law or acknowledge @entity26 has failed and can not be salvaged , " said @entity111 , communications director for @entity108			1
one @entity1 , @entity117 rep. @entity116 , told @entity118 that conservative activists had been strongly engaged with @entity2 members on the issue in recent weeks			2
i " absolutely heard from a lot of our conservative groups over the ( summer ) break about defunding @entity26 , " @entity116 said			0
" the pressure was absolutely there ... ( though ) i did n't feel like it was pressure per se because i agreed we need to do away with @entity26			2
" opinion : worried about @entity26 ? fear not another @entity1 , freshman rep. @entity130 of @entity131 , predicted the @entity2 will eventually give in to at least some @entity1 demands			1
" i think the president will negotiate with us , " he said			0
other republicans seemed less sure			0
" we ca n't let the government shut down , " said rep. @entity136 , @entity16 - @entity137			1
" we ca n't be kamikazes and we ca n't be @entity141			2
" a top @entity11 @entity142 warned @entity2 @entity1 they were playing a losing hand			1
" @entity1 leaders in the @entity2 have decided to give the hard right their day in the sun , and decided to pursue an agenda that they know will never , ever be signed into law , " @entity137 's @entity144 said			2
" @entity149 , stop these zealots in your party from driving our economy off a cliff			0
" meanwhile , with a potential government shutdown less than two weeks away , the @entity2 budget office directed federal agencies on wednesday to prepare for a potential shutdown			2
@entity159 , director of the @entity160 , told federal agencies to update their plans in the event no agreement is reached before september 30 , the end of the fiscal year			0
" @entity168 management requires that agencies be prepared for the possibility of a lapse , " @entity159 wrote .			0
