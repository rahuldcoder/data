@entity0 -- @entity3 's fight for the @entity4 was a microcosm of his political career and broader life -- full of near - death experiences , stunning comebacks and close calls			1
sen. @entity3 gestures as he delivers his concession speech tuesday night			1
the former @entity13 fighter pilot , who 'd been shot down over @entity14 and held as a pow , had been able to battle back every time until tuesday night			1
he regained respect in the @entity17 after being accused of improperly helping fraudster savings and loan chief @entity20 in the 1980s ; he got back on speaking terms with the @entity23 base after his primary defeat against @entity25 in 2000 ; and he revitalized his campaign after its near - death last summer from lack of cash and power struggles to capture the nomination			1
what would have been his greatest political comeback -- to seize the @entity4 -- proved to be too difficult			1
a @entity23 win in what is being seen as a " @entity36 year " was always a long shot			1
whoever was the @entity23 nominee was going to have to fight against the legacy of the previous eight years of a @entity23 president who became highly unpopular because of the @entity44 war , administration gaffes such as the handling of @entity46 , and what turned from a credit crunch into a global economic crisis			1
the @entity51 senator even managed to make the race appear competitive , soaring in the polls on the back of a polished convention and popular vp pick , gov. @entity57			1
but he made mistakes , too			1
combined with the electorate 's disenchantment with his party , it ensured defeat			2
turning points @entity66 : @entity3 's great high point came in january , amid the snows of @entity66 , when primary voters boosted him from long shot to top - tier candidate , just as they had eight years earlier			1
he stunned a crowded @entity23 field -- including @entity75 , the well - funded former governor of neighboring @entity77 , and @entity79 caucus winner @entity78 -- and proved himself a force to be reckoned with			2
not @entity81 : democrats were n't the only ones who expected @entity81 to put a quick end to the primary season -- the @entity23 machine had spent years honing plans to fight the @entity89 senator in a general election			1
not only were those plans ruined , but suddenly the challenger was a fresh face with little baggage who captured the public 's imagination			2
and as the epic @entity36 primary season gave many headlines to @entity101 , it also helped him develop networks of supporters in traditionally red states			1
and millions of new @entity101 supporters also became donors , financing a record - breaking fundraising effort			2
@entity25 : @entity3 may never have been a great friend of the president , but he could hardly turn down an endorsement from him at the @entity4			2
it was a photo - op that launched a thousand attack ads. even if the unpopular president was a virtual no - show on the campaign trail , it was easy for the @entity36 to remind voters who @entity3 's party colleague was			1
straight talk : one of @entity3 's strengths had been his relationship with news groups , gaining appreciation by answering reporters ' questions until there were none left			2
but when asked whether he agreed with campaign supporter @entity127 that health insurance plans that covered @entity129 should cover birth control as well , he had no answer			2
cameras rolled on his @entity134 campaign bus as he sat silently , looking awkward -- long moments of video that would be replayed again and again			0
virtually overnight , news conferences disappeared from @entity3 's agenda as advisers who believed that an open - door media policy did not help persuaded their man they were right			0
@entity3 was left to repeat the rehearsed lines of his stump speech , losing the opportunity to impress in candid moments and his likability numbers began to slip			0
@entity147 pick : @entity3 made his " @entity151 " pick -- privately acknowledged by some advisers as his only shot of winning -- with the governor of @entity153 , @entity57			0
for a few weeks , it looked like that game - winning touchdown could happen as the base - rousing running mate burst onto the national scene with such power that the @entity23 ticket took the lead in major opinion polls			0
but inconvenient investigations , unfortunate interview performances and questions about qualifications soon hit @entity57 's approval ratings			0
@entity3 's own reputation was tarnished as revelations about hasty vetting raised questions in voters ' minds about his judgment			1
and by then , his central argument against @entity101 -- that experience was critical -- was essentially off the table given @entity57 's relatively thin resume			0
meltdown response : ask @entity23 insiders when they knew the fight was lost , and most will point to @entity3 's decision to halt campaigning as the depth of the financial crisis became apparent			1
the rise of the economy from a key election issue to the only issue was never going to help the candidate who 'd said earlier it was not his strong suit			0
but his bid to get in front with a dramatic departure from the campaign trail backfired			0
he became a bit player at best , again raising the question of leadership ability and judgment and coming up wanting against his opponent			0
@entity3 was never assured victory			0
but nor was defeat guaranteed			0
some of his toughest breaks were outside of his control ; other wounds were self - inflicted			0
maybe -- given personality , politics and circumstance -- he could not have made decisions other than the ones he chose			0
but those choices helped seal his loss			0
@entity1 's @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity216 contributed to this report .			0
