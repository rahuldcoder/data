it 's not hard to dash out a @entity2 status update saying how much you 're digging " @entity4 " or the new @entity6 song			1
but @entity2 wants to make it even easier			2
the social network on wednesday said it 's rolling out an audio - recognition feature that lets you automatically tag music , tv shows or movies in status updates			1
the feature employs your phone 's microphone to identify the song or tv show while it 's playing and tag it in your post , saving you the trouble of typing it yourself			1
in this way , the new tool acts sort of like @entity26 , the mobile app that can tell you what song is playing on the radio			0
@entity2 said the unnamed feature will be available to @entity33 users on @entity35 and @entity36 devices " in the coming weeks			1
" of course , the more information @entity2 users share about themselves and their tastes , the more @entity2 can target ads at its 1.2 billion users			0
here 's how it works : if you 've turned the feature on , you 'll see an audio icon jiggling on your phone 's screen as you write a status update			2
that means the feature is listening and trying to find a match ; if it does , you can then add the song , tv show or movie to your post			1
as with any @entity2 post , you can choose which of your friends can see it			0
you can also turn the feature off at any time by clicking an audio icon at the top right of the screen			0
@entity2 said that if you choose to share a song , your friends can listen to a 30 - second snippet			2
for tv shows , @entity2 said your @entity71 post will highlight the specific season and episode you 're watching , " so you can avoid any spoilers and join in conversations with your friends after you 've caught up			1
" that 's probably for the best -- nobody wants overeager commenters revealing unforseen deaths in " @entity80			0
" for movies , the feature will presumably work best for people watching at home , since most movie houses ( and moviegoers ) frown on glowing screens in the theater .			0
