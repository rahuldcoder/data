@entity0 , @entity1 last september in the heart of @entity0			2
it had officially " opened " a few months prior but no companies were listed yet			2
the trading room was filled with new desks and computer monitors , waiting for someone to power them on			1
fast forward seven months and the stock exchange is now starting to breathe signs of life -- there is now one company trading on the exchange			1
on april 18 , the @entity4 started trading with the ipo of the state utility company , " @entity22			1
" as a frontier market , @entity1 is still a work in progress			2
the government is trying to woo international investors by throwing open its doors and virtually saying , " we will make it easy for you			2
" there are no capital controls			1
no requirements for joint ventures			1
international companies can own 100 % of their local business in @entity1			2
the only major restriction is on foreign ownership of land			0
with a young labor force that commands cheaper wages than @entity42 , @entity1 has been looking attractive to foreign companies			0
despite these incentives , there are many challenges for the new stock exchange : challenge # 1 : short - term investors even with just one company trading , the exchange generated a lot of interest among local and foreign investors			1
in the first three days of trading , the share price for the water utility rose 60 % above its ipo price , but by the following week , short term - investors started selling to take in profits			1
the stock price came down substantially			1
" it 's kind of a typical phenomenon for a new exchange			1
it happened in the @entity68 market and @entity70 's market			0
it is no surprise to me , " says @entity71 , managing director of @entity72 which was the sole underwriter of the ipo			0
" some people made a 50 % profit within a few days			0
they tend to be short sighted by this fluctuation in price and it will take some time for them to understand the market and make long - term investments			0
" challenge # 2 : more companies need to list you need more than one company to make a stock exchange thrive			1
@entity68 ' stock market opened in january 2011 and it still has only two companies trading			1
the volume of trade is fairly stagnant			0
that 's exactly what investors do n't want to see with the @entity4			1
another company , @entity96 , is preparing its ipo later this year			1
" i do n't see any reason why eventually you ca n't have a dozen companies trading on the stock exchange			1
a lot of the big banks are listable , " says @entity103 , chief investment officer of @entity104 which invests in pre-emerging markets			0
" i know some brokers have mandates from garment manufacturers ( to prepare to list )			0
" he also believes the success of the @entity4 can have a nice domino effect			1
if it starts to hum , brokers will publish research on both @entity1 and @entity68 stock exchange - listed companies , generating interest in the region			1
the key is to get more companies to list and greater volume trading			1
challenge # 3 : proper accounting in order for a company to list on the @entity5 , it must have at least three years of proper audits prepared by an accredited international accounting firm approved by the @entity1 government			2
this is a tough challenge for many local , @entity1 companies			0
when i was in @entity1 last september , one analyst told me that he could n't think of one large @entity1 company that had audited financial statements			2
so it will take time for some local companies to get up to speed			0
challenge # 4 : volatility of a @entity144 the government is doing its best to showcase the stock exchange			1
in one of the busiest traffic intersections of @entity0 , there is a large stock market television screen that shows the stock market moves			2
it generates interest among individual retail investors who can watch the stock price as they sit in traffic			2
institutional investors from @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity42 have also taken a bite of the recent ipo but whether that interest can be sustained is still a big question			0
@entity1 is new to the game			0
risk and volatility are inherent in a frontier market			0
corruption is a concern even though the government passed an anti-corruption law in 2010			0
@entity71 is very frank about the risks			0
" in general , the lack of a capital market infrastructure can be a challenge for investors , " he says			2
" the cost of capacity building can be a challenge for investors who are not familiar with a market like @entity1			0
in terms of corporate governance ( e.g. accounting , business ethics ) , there 's a long way to go for local family - owned businesses			0
but once you understand the market here , there can be more opportunity than risk			0

the @entity4 started trading with one company on april 18
there are neither capital controls nor requirements for joint ventures
but despite incentives , the stock exchange faces many challenges
