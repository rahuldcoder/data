@entity102 and other @entity14 government agencies also have people in @entity3			2
@entity105 said experts from the @entity14 @entity107 are embedded with the @entity14 military , and " rule of law " experts are working to extend a justice system " so that the @entity8 would not offer the only form of justice in @entity3			2
" have a more robust partnership with @entity115 @entity8 fighters have long been operating in the mountainous region along @entity3 's border with @entity115 , battling @entity14 and @entity3 government forces on one side and @entity115 troops on the other			1

about 4,000 @entity128 troops are in eastern @entity3 , hunting @entity5 leaders			0
any plan to bolster @entity3 must also work to help @entity115 , @entity1 said			1
" we will strengthen @entity115 's capacity to target these groups that threaten our countries , " @entity1 said			2
" @entity14 is also providing substantial resources to support @entity115 's democracy and development			2
" in the past , @entity1 said , some in @entity115 have argued that the struggle against the @entity8 and other militants was n't @entity115 's fight			0
but the @entity115 army recently has been attacking the @entity8 stronghold of @entity144 after a series of deadly bomb attacks across the country			0
" public opinion has turned ... and there is no doubt that the @entity14 and @entity115 share a common enemy , " @entity1 said			1
