-- so let 's try to recount why we are where we are			0
in august 2011 , @entity4 was trying to figure out how to raise the debt ceiling -- so the @entity6 might continue to pay its bills -- when a stunt was hatched : kick the can down the road			1
and not only kick it down the road , but do it in a way that would eventually force @entity4 to do its job : invent a punishment			1
if the politicians failed to come up with some kind of budget deal , the blunt instrument of across - the - board cuts in every area would await			1
unthinkable ! untenable ! until now			1
in fact , something designed to be worse than any conceivable agreement is now completely acceptable to many			2
and not only are these forced budget cuts considered acceptable , they 're even applauded			1
some republicans figure they 'll never find a way to get 5 % across - the - board domestic spending cuts like this again , so go for it			2
and some liberal democrats likewise say 8 % cuts in military spending are better than anything we might get on our own , so go for it			2
opinion : forced budget cuts a disaster for military the result : a draconian plan designed to force the two sides to get together has now turned out to be too weak to do that			1
and what does that tell us ? more about the collapse of the political process than it does about the merits of any budget cuts			1
official @entity4 has completely abdicated responsibility , taking its dysfunction to a new level -- which is really saying something			1
we 've learned since the election that the second - term president is feeling chipper			2
with re-election came the power to force republicans to raise taxes on the wealthy in the fiscal cliff negotiations , and good for him			0
@entity6 voted , and said that 's what they wanted , and so it happened			0
even the most sullen @entity28 knew that tax fight had been lost			0
points on the board for the @entity74			1
now the evil " sequester " -- the forced budget cuts -- looms			1
and the president proposes what he calls a " balanced " approach : closing tax loopholes on the rich and budget cuts			1
it 's something he knows @entity28 will never go for			0
they raised taxes six weeks ago , and they 're not going to do it again now			0
they already gave at the office			0
and @entity28 also say , with some merit , that taxes were never meant to be a part of the discussion of across - the - board cuts			2
politics : @entity95 more emotional on spending cuts here 's the problem : the election is over			2
@entity95 won , and he does n't really have to keep telling us -- or showing us , via staged campaign - style events like the one tuesday in which he used police officers as props while he opposed the forced spending cuts			2
what we 're waiting for is the plan to translate victory into effective governance			0
sure , there 's no doubt the president has the upper hand			0
he 's right to believe that @entity28 calls for austerity do not constitute a cohesive party platform			0
he knows that the @entity28 has no singular , effective leader , and that its message is unformed			0
and he 's probably hoping that the next two years can be used effectively to further undermine the @entity28 and win back a @entity120 majority in the @entity74			1
slight problem : there 's plenty of real work to be done , on the budget , on tax reform , on immigration , climate change and guns			0
a second - term president has a small window of opportunity			0
and a presidential legacy is not something that can be kicked down the road			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity138 .			1

@entity138 : @entity140 of deep budget cuts was designed to compel *compromise*
she says the " unthinkable " cuts now have many *supporters*
the likelihood that cuts may happen shows new level of @entity4 dysfunction , she says
@entity138 : president may want a 2014 @entity74 victory , but action needed now
