-- on @entity3 , after months of suffering from debilitating headaches , i learned that i had brain cancer			1
i was 29 years old			1
i 'd been married for just over a year			1
my husband and i were trying for a family			1
our lives devolved into hospital stays , doctor consultations and medical research			2
nine days after my initial diagnoses , i had a partial craniotomy and a partial resection of my temporal lobe			2
both surgeries were an effort to stop the growth of my tumor			2
in april , i learned that not only had my tumor come back , but it was more aggressive			1
doctors gave me a prognosis of six months to live			1
because my tumor is so large , doctors prescribed full brain radiation			1
i read about the side effects : the hair on my scalp would have been singed off			0
my scalp would be left covered with first - degree burns			0
my quality of life , as i knew it , would be gone			0
after months of research , my family and i reached a heartbreaking conclusion : there is no treatment that would save my life , and the recommended treatments would have destroyed the time i had left			1
i considered passing away in hospice care at my @entity40 - area home			0
but even with palliative medication , i could develop potentially morphine - resistant pain and suffer personality changes and verbal , cognitive and motor loss of virtually any kind			1
because the rest of my body is young and healthy , i am likely to physically hang on for a long time even though cancer is eating my mind			2
i probably would have suffered in hospice care for weeks or even months			2
and my family would have had to watch that			1
i did not want this nightmare scenario for my family , so i started researching death with dignity			1
it is an end - of - life option for mentally competent , terminally ill patients with a prognosis of six months or less to live			1
it would enable me to use the medical practice of aid in dying : i could request and receive a prescription from a physician for medication that i could self - ingest to end my dying process if it becomes unbearable			2
i quickly decided that death with dignity was the best option for me and my family			1
we had to uproot from @entity71 to @entity72 , because @entity72 is one of only five states where death with dignity is authorized			1
i met the criteria for death with dignity in @entity72 , but establishing residency in the state to make use of the law required a monumental number of changes			1
i had to find new physicians , establish residency in @entity87 , search for a new home , obtain a new driver 's license , change my voter registration and enlist people to take care of our animals , and my husband , @entity94 , had to take a leave of absence from his job			0
the vast majority of families do not have the flexibility , resources and time to make all these changes			0
i 've had the medication for weeks			0
if i were , i would have consumed that medication long ago			0
i do not want to die			0
and i want to die on my own terms			0
@entity105 , advocate for ' death with dignity , ' dies i would not tell anyone else that he or she should choose death with dignity			1
my question is : who has the right to tell me that i do n't deserve this choice ? that i deserve to suffer for weeks or months in tremendous amounts of physical and emotional pain ? why should anyone have the right to make that choice for me ? opinion : when assisted suicide is not the answer now that i 've had the prescription filled and it 's in my possession , i have experienced a tremendous sense of relief			1
and if i decide to change my mind about taking the medication , i will not take it			0
having this choice at the end of my life has become incredibly important			0
it has given me a sense of peace during a tumultuous time that otherwise would be dominated by fear , uncertainty and pain			2
now , i 'm able to move forward in my remaining days or weeks i have on this beautiful @entity141 , to seek joy and love and to spend time traveling to outdoor wonders of nature with those i love			0
and i know that i have a safety net			0
dying young and on her own terms i plan to celebrate my husband 's birthday on october 26 with him and our family			1
unless my condition improves dramatically , i will look to pass soon thereafter			0
i hope for the sake of my fellow @entity158 citizens that i 'll never meet that this option is available to you			2
if you ever find yourself walking a mile in my shoes , i hope that you would at least be given the same choice and that no one tries to take it from you			0
when my suffering becomes too great , i can say to all those i love , " i love you ; come be by my side , and come say goodbye as i pass into whatever 's next			0
" i will die upstairs in my bedroom with my husband , mother , stepfather and best friend by my side and pass peacefully			0
i ca n't imagine trying to rob anyone else of that choice			2
share your personal essays with @entity178			0

married for a year , @entity105 , 29 , found she had aggressive brain cancer
she had six months to live , and she did n't want her family to watch her dying in pain
@entity185 and her family moved to @entity72 to take advantage of the death with @entity190 law
she says nobody has the right to take away the option from someone who is terminally ill
