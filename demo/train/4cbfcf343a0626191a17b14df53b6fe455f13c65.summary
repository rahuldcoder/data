let 's go ! first up : @entity21 @entity25 : " he shall from time to time give to @entity24 information on the @entity21			1
" the words of the @entity27 and the reason why president @entity29 delivered his @entity21 address to @entity24 last night			1
a little background for you here : this speech has n't always been called the " @entity21			1
" it used to be called the " annual message			2
" but the purpose has always been the same : for the president to talk about some of the biggest issues facing the country			1
that is why president @entity29 spent a good part of last night 's speech talking about the economy and the challenges facing the country			1
@entity47 president @entity29 : one year ago , i took office amid two wars , an economy rocked by a severe recession , a financial system on the verge of collapse , and a government deeply in debt			1
experts from across the political spectrum warned that if we did not act , we might face a second depression			2
so we acted , immediately and aggressively			2
and one year later , the worst of the storm has passed			2
one in ten @entity47 still can not find work			1
@entity67 response @entity25 : after the @entity21 , it 's traditional for the other party to offer its response to the president			1
last night , the @entity67 response was given by newly - elected @entity74 governor @entity73			1
he won that election last year			2
@entity73 made his speech from the @entity77			1
he talked about some of the political issues that both parties agree on			2
but he also focused on some of the areas , especially when it comes to the economy , where @entity67 and @entity84 do n't see eye to eye			1
gov. @entity73 , ( r ) @entity74 : in the past year , more three million people have lost their jobs , yet the @entity24 continues deficit spending , adding to the bureaucracy , and increasing the national debt on our children and grandchildren			2
the amount of this debt is on pace to double in five years and triple in ten			2
the federal debt is already over $ 100,000 per household			2
the president 's partial freeze announced tonight on discretionary spending is a laudable step , but a small one			1

it 's also a big concern for residents of @entity4 , @entity5			1
and when the largest employer left town , about 10,000 of those people lost their jobs			1
@entity4 is hoping that money from the government 's stimulus bill will turn things around			1

nearby businesses started to topple and continue to fall			0
in all , 10,000 people in this area lost their jobs			0
the head of the county 's homeless shelter tells us she 's seen the effects , and she 's having a hard time meeting the demand for shelter and food			1
@entity154 is getting stimulus money through a grant , but it 's not much ; $ 200,000 spread out over 3 years that will help keep people in their homes			1
but she says jobs , the only thing that would really help , remain elusive			0
@entity162 , @entity164 @entity163 : the frustration of continuing to refer them to places only to be told , you know , " we 've got 500 resumes before you 've even walked in the door , " and the frustration of them not having any opportunities			0
@entity176 : to create opportunities , @entity4 's mayor @entity177 applied for more than $ 61 million worth of stimulus projects			1
of that , roughly $ 5 million has been awarded so far to a project to create jobs			0
it 's focused on @entity4 's downtown and is set to start this spring			1
so , how do you see this benefiting from stimulus money ? @entity188 , @entity4 mayor : with the stimulus project , we 'll be able to improve our curbs and gutters and sidewalks @entity176 : the hope , he says , is that improvements will attract businesses			0
in the immediate future , the project is estimated to create about 100 jobs			0
@entity201 : they 're going to be construction jobs , but it 's something , it 's something			1
we want jobs here of any type right now			0
@entity176 : to get thousands of others back to work , the mayor has set his sights on @entity4 's airpark and is hoping to redevelop it			1
eight million dollars in stimulus money , he says , is being used to retrain workers , and he 's optimistic @entity217 will come through with more aid if the airpark comes back to life			1
@entity201 : i have tried to maintain a close relationship with our state partners and with our federal partners to say , " look , we need help and what can you do ? " and they have responded , but that does n't mean they 've responded as much as i would like or anybody would like			0

that is n't happening in some @entity266 , which is why the company is recalling over two million vehicles			0
this includes some of @entity261 's best selling models			1
