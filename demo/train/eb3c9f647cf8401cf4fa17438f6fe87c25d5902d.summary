" ... the victim appeared to have been targeted by the suspect , and it was no more and no less than that			1
" @entity16 identified the victim as @entity23 , a 21 - year - old senior from @entity24 , @entity25 , who also worked at the school as a teaching assistant			1

by 6 p.m. @entity37 police had executed a search warrant on @entity29 ' home , with city police chief @entity40 saying his officers had " previous contact with the suspect ( for what ) i believe ( was ) an alcohol offense			1
" authorities have not explained why @entity48 might have been killed , nor have they detailed his relationship with the suspect , including whether he was a teaching assistant in one of @entity29 ' classes			2
nor have they described the type of gun used in the crime			2
@entity56 first learned about the incident on @entity58			2
the noontime shooting rattled many people 's nerves in and around the @entity37 campus of @entity3 , where about 30,000 undergraduates attend			1
" you hear about school shootings all the time , but you never expect it to happen where you live , " said @entity64 , who works a few blocks away from what 's known as the @entity67 and went to the scene			2

" @entity16 said some on the scene claimed to hear " four to five shots fired			0
" one of those inside the building was @entity78 , a @entity3 senior from @entity79			1

" we heard it immediately and everyone was like , ' ok , let 's go			0
" he recalled " officers coming in fast , " including four on the building 's second floor armed with what looked like assault rifles , and saw several people " getting handcuffed " and one man " with blood on his hands			2
" in another video interview on the same website , sophomore @entity100 said he first heard cries of " get down , get down , get down " after leaving a bathroom and did n't know what to make of it			0
after he returned to a large lecture hall , @entity100 said , " a cop came in and said , ' get out , get out , everyone get out of the building			2
' " @entity111 had a similar experience			0
he did n't hear gunshots but heard shouting outside his lecture hall , which was in a building connected to the one where the bloodshed occurred			2
" originally , i just thought it was just people being loud , " the 20 - year - old @entity111 told @entity56			0
" when i heard ( shouting ) the second time , i thought something was probably going on			0
" eventually , " someone came in and yelled to evacuate the building and then an alarm went off , " he added			0
" i walked out , " @entity111 said of the chilling scene outside -- and not just because the wind chill dipped below zero tuesday outside -- " and there were police cars everywhere			0
" @entity16 commended the quick response by officers , as well as @entity37 police and school authorities , saying " everyone did exactly what they should have done			1
" the police chief added : " you train and plan , and train and plan for one of these incidents and hope it never happens			2
but unfortunately , it did			0
" the school sent text messages about the shooting to students , asking them to take shelter where they were			1
that request was lifted by 1:30 p.m. , though the electrical engineering building still was closed so police could investigate , school spokeswoman @entity146 said			1
@entity150 said then that " the rest of campus is open " and classes were under way			0
but a few hours later , @entity3 provost @entity155 announced classes for the rest of tuesday and all of wednesday were canceled			2
a tuesday night candlelight vigil took place on the heels of a shooting that unnerved many in what @entity16 called " one of the safest communities in the @entity166			0
" " @entity171 crime , whenever and wherever it occurs , shocks our conscience and incites our rage , " said @entity167 , @entity3 's president and a former governor of the state			1
" when it happens in our home , to a family member -- and , as a @entity177 , @entity23 was family to us -- those emotions are more powerful still			0
" @entity155 said one key part of the vigil was to announce details about counseling to those grieving or trying to make sense of the violence			0
while authorities stressed they do n't believe there is any continued threat to students , faculty or staff , the provost said that the @entity3 community will need time to heal			1
" of course , it 's not over , " @entity155 said			0
" it 's just beginning			0
