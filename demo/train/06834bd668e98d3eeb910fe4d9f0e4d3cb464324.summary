" @entity2 " stormed the box office this past weekend with $ 105 million in ticket sales			2
not since the @entity5 movies have so many farmers and ranch hands buddy - upped to the popcorn counter			2
as much as i adore @entity10 , i wo n't be seeing the movie			2
i ca n't see it			2
and my reluctance to see it has nothing to do with @entity16 's flippant assertion that snipers are cowards ( although he said he was n't talking about the movie )			1
i was always taught that cowards are those who refuse to serve their country			2
friends who 've seen the movie say i 'm missing out			1
they say it is an accurate portrayal of what happens in war			1
one friend , who declares herself as a pacifist , urged me to go			1
" far from glorifying war , it made war look brutal , and a means of destroying people for life , " she said			1
what i keep wondering is why all these moviegoers were n't lining up to volunteer for war			1
before his ironic death , @entity37 , on whom the movie is based , denounced @entity41 's version of war			1
" @entity41 fantasizes about it and makes it look good			1
it -- war sucks , " he told @entity46 ' @entity45 in 2012			1
@entity48 deserves credit for the truth he does show			2
women and children are killed more often than @entity53 like to consider			2
and good soldiers are always haunted by the comrades they could n't save			2
the surgeon who tried to save my soldier father in @entity60 's @entity59 still considers july 24 , 1966 , one of the worst days of his life			1
the men who were there that day tell me that my father grabbed @entity67 's arm and begged him , " do n't let me die			1
" @entity67 did his best to save my father			1
i have thanked him for that			0
still , he regrets that he did n't save him , and i hate that he lives with that			0
maybe that 's why i ca n't see the movie			1
when you have experienced firsthand the multitude of ways war wreaks havoc on families , you have little tolerance for the mythmaking that war always seems to invoke			1
not to mention the patriotic , almost nationalistic fervor that accompanies a flag - draped coffin			0
related : why ' @entity2 ' is a smash hit when my father died there were no crowds gathered at @entity87 , no jumbotron displaying pictures of the family man my father was , and no front - page stories			1
there was just a broken family feeling very abandoned by an ungrateful nation			0
the other reason i ca n't see the movie is my friend sgt. @entity97			1
@entity97 was serving with 9th @entity98 ( @entity99 ) , @entity100 when he was struck by a sniper 's bullet on may 28 , 1970			1
the bullet took out his lower jaw and all of his teeth			0
the company medic , spec. @entity106 , was killed by the next bullet while yanking @entity97 to safety			0
@entity97 spent 19 months at @entity110 relearning skills toddlers know : how to chew			0
how not to slobber all over himself			0
when i met him in 2005 , @entity97 was not getting help for his post-traumatic stress disorder			0
he did n't think he deserved benefits			0
before his death from cancer in 2009 , @entity97 and i forged a friendship from our experiences in war -- his as a soldier , mine as a @entity125 daughter			1
every day as he went through the motions of putting in a set of false teeth , @entity97 remembered the sniper he so longed to forget			0
@entity106 , the medic , left behind a young pregnant wife			0
he felt bad that he had lived and @entity106 had died			0
i serve on a couple of boards of national organizations for veterans			0
i know by name the men and women who have suffered the aftermath of war			2
they are not fictional characters to me			0
their numbers are in my cell phone			0
i have wept with them at the @entity147 in @entity148 and at graves at @entity150			0
i have buried my @entity125 mother beside the only man she ever loved , my father			2
why ' @entity2 ' is a smash hit @entity41 has a way of fictionalizing war , of making it all about " us " and " them			1
" " @entity162 " was one of the names @entity37 gave to the @entity161 people			0
he said he did n't give a " flying f * * k about the @entity161			0
that 's how the military trains snipers like him			2
" every person i killed i strongly believe that they were bad , " @entity37 told the @entity170			0
i have traveled to my father 's battlefield in @entity60 and i have befriended @entity60 who lost even more than i did during the war			1
i have learned there is no " us " and " them			0
" there is only " us			0
i wish @entity41 would make a war movie that gets that point across .			1

@entity185 : @entity41 should not glorify war and make it about " us " *vs.* " them "
she describes her father 's death and a friend 's serious injury in @entity196
when you 've experienced *effects* of war firsthand , she says , you lose tolerance for mythmaking
