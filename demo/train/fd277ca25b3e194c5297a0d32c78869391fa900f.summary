@entity0 is probably best known as the the rubber - faced comedian who made famous the catchphrase " dyn - o - mite ! " on the popular 1970s sitcom " @entity5			1
" he has penned a memoir titled , you guessed it , " dyn - o - mite			1
" it is the story of @entity0 's rise from poverty in the @entity12 to becoming a comedian for the @entity14 and then finding huge success as @entity16 on " @entity5			1
" @entity0 is not afraid to speak his mind , whether it be discussing the controversy surrounding the sitcom , his feelings about fellow comedians and his unorthodox political views			1
@entity24 : when you started out , your act was considered " too black			1
" @entity0 : i was coming from the @entity14 , and of course they were dealing with the black plight			1
too preachy , i think it was more like ' do n't lay that plight thing on us			1
' @entity24 : tell me about [ the catchphrase ] " dyn - o - mite ! " @entity0 : that thing was a @entity38 deal			1
he was an illustrious and wonderful director / producer			1
@entity38 was a veteran of many things , ' @entity40 , ' ' the @entity41			1
' i did it one day in rehearsal and he said , ' that 's it ! we 've got it now , ' and i said , ' what have we got ? ' and he said , ' i want you to do that dyn - o - mite thing			1
' i said , ' really ? ' he said , ' yeah we 're going to do that every show			2
' i said , ' come on man , people are not stupid enough to buy into a guy just standing there saying dyn - o - mite			1
' he said , ' yes they are			2
' even though @entity61 ( creator ) did n't like it , @entity38 proved to be a prophet			2
@entity24 : were you hurt by @entity66 ' or @entity68 's ( negative ) comments ? ( the pair were quoted as complaining about the direction of the show in making @entity0 's character the lead and what they viewed as the series ' negative imagery			1
) @entity0 : no not at all			1
the reality is i never spoke to them			2
i 've been on the phone with you for three minutes			2
that 's more time than i ever spoke to them			2
being a stand - up , i was mainly in the clubs			1
my time on the show was actually very relaxing because it got me away from my writers			2
i did n't have to listen to the moans and groans of my writers			2
everyone had a complaint about something			2
@entity24 : you say that you 're a black sheep in the black community			2
@entity0 : some of the stuff that happened on our show , it made it look like we were , as they say , ' not black enough			1
' the black community kind of turned a little on us			2
it was kind of like @entity107 where they do n't embrace him because he plays golf , and it 's not a black sport			2
@entity24 : so does it bother you not being accepted ? @entity0 : no , because as you move on and do other things , you stop working in front of black crowds anyway			1
@entity117 does n't really have a black following			2
i call myself the @entity120 of comedy because i do n't do the black thing			0
@entity24 : how do you describe yourself politically ? @entity0 : i 'm a realist independent			1
i 'm against affirmative action because we 're at a point now where some things outlive their usefulness			0
@entity24 : you 're also against gay marriage			1
@entity0 : yeah i am			1
there 's just certain traditions that need to be upheld			0
i 'll give you the other side of it , no it does n't affect me , no it does n't change my life			1
there 's just traditions that need to be dealt with			0
i 'm a believer that gay marriage should be passed because the battle is not worth the war			1
the gay lobby is very loud			0
i 'm totally against it			0
in 100 years from now , people are going to go , ' who was against gay marriage ? ' and i 'll be one of those idiots and say , ' that 's me			1
' i 'm just against it on moral grounds , that 's it			0
i 'm as much a heathen as anybody			0
i just do n't believe on moral grounds it should be done			0
i do n't like it , i do n't accept it			0
@entity24 : you were good friends with @entity159 , but are no longer			0
@entity0 : i 'm a fan of @entity159			1
i have nothing against him			0
i think he 's still today one of the @entity162 comics in the country			0
what he has done is let us down as a comedy community by not bringing on any new acts			0
he 's been on 30 years and has n't broken one act			0
come on ! for @entity159 not to do that , it 's embarrassing , all i want for @entity159 to do is do what was done for him , that 's all			0
i do n't hate @entity159 , i think what he 's done is bad			0
@entity24 : you have very nice things to say about @entity176			0
@entity0 : @entity176 may not be a people person , but if you 're his friend , you 're his friend			1
the whole intern thing ... i said this to people , ' if you had said to me two years ago , @entity176 is sleeping with his intern and cheating on @entity182 , ' i would have said , ' you got ta kill me because that ai n't happening , ' and i would have been dead			0
i never would have believed that because @entity176 is a very shy guy			0
he 's never really hit on chicks			0
he does n't go out with attractive women , he does n't try to do that			0
if i 'm @entity176 , i got me a @entity189 magazine and i 'm going , ' bring this girl to me now ! ' @entity24 : you seem to be quite the ladies man			0
@entity0 : no , i 'm not			1
you have to go through a lot to get women because they 're so upset about everything , but if you get a nice woman , that is a great feeling			0
when you get older and the women are in their 40s and 50s they 're all divorced , they 've all got kids , they all hate men , so you have to listen and let them vent			0
you hope they have girlfriends so they can vent to their girlfriends .			0
