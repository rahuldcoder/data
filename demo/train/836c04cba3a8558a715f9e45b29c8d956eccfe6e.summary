the department says it is taking comprehensive steps to improve , including programs for primary care and mental health care for female veterans , along with having a female veterans ' program manager in each of its medical facilities			1

only one - third of veterans ' facilities offer a separate space for women to receive gynecological , mental health and social work services , according to @entity56			1

they are absolutely not dodging it			0

" women are screened for unique health concerns like cervical cancer or breast cancer at higher rates than @entity120 health care programs , " she noted			2
while noting that the department has taken steps to upgrade its services and facilities to meet the needs of female veterans , investigators found that it stumbled on some more basic elements			0
none of the facilities visited was fully compliant with the department 's standards for privacy , investigators found , including privacy in the check - in area			0
" in most clinical settings , check - in desk or windows were located in a mixed - gender waiting room or on a high - traffic public corridor , " the report explained			0

" in one facility , it said , investigators observed other patients lining up immediately behind the patient trying to check in			0
the government investigators also found that exam tables were not oriented away from the door or shielded properly by curtains , as is required , and there was a lack of toilets near the facilities where gynecological examinations were conducted			0
