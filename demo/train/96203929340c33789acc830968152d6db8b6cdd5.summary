@entity0 -- the @entity3 - controlled @entity2 on thursday passed the @entity6 leadership 's 2013 budget plan -- a measure that has no chance of passing the @entity10 - controlled @entity9 but creates a clear contrast between the two parties on a number of critical tax and spending issues ahead of the general election			1
the resolution passed in a strongly polarized 228 - 191 vote			0
no @entity10 backed the measure ; only 10 @entity3 opposed it			2
@entity22 chairman @entity21 's $ 3.53 trillion blueprint includes an overhaul of the nation 's tax code and major changes to popular entitlements such as @entity28 -- expensive programs that in the past have been considered politically untouchable			1
why the budget may never be balanced @entity3 say the plan is necessary to slow the growth of exploding federal deficits and put the federal government on the road to fiscal stability			2
" we have one of the most predictable economic crises in this country coming			0
it 's a debt - driven crisis			0
and so we have an obligation -- not just a legal obligation but a moral obligation -- to do something about it , " @entity21 , a @entity43 @entity3 , said thursday morning			2
@entity6 leaders " think the key components are to get spending under control , reform our entitlement programs " and help stimulate economic growth			2
democrats , however , consider the plan a betrayal of last year 's bipartisan deficit reduction deal and a @entity6 giveaway to the wealthy at the expense of the middle class and vulnerable seniors			1
" in our view , we certainly do n't want to return to some of the economic policies that got us into the mess to begin with			0
and we are concerned that the @entity3 budget does that , " said @entity67 rep. @entity66 , a member of the @entity2 @entity10 leadership			1
" it disrupts the fragile recovery and undercuts investments that are going to be important for the long - term economic strength of the @entity75			0
" @entity77 press secretary @entity76 released a statement after the vote blasting @entity80 for banding " together to shower millionaires and billionaires with a massive tax cut paid for by ending @entity28 as we know it and making extremely deep cuts to critical programs needed to create jobs and strengthen the middle class			1
" @entity89 garners two endorsements over the past two days , the sharply divided @entity2 has overwhelmingly rejected president @entity92 's budget proposal , a @entity2 @entity10 plan , a more conservative @entity3 alternative , and a bipartisan blueprint containing controversial spending cuts and tax hikes opposed by majorities in both parties			1
the blueprint -- derived from proposals advanced by a special commission led by former clinton white house chief of staff @entity103 and former @entity6 sen. @entity105 -- includes roughly $ 2 trillion in cuts and more than $ 1 trillion in new tax revenues over the next decade			1
the measure failed in a 382 - 38 vote			0
while a budget resolution is not binding , it is used to guide congressional appropriators responsible for allocating federal dollars			0
both chambers of @entity115 have not agreed on such a measure since the spring of 2009			0
among other things , the @entity21 plan calls for a reduction in individual tax rates and brackets			1
instead of today 's six brackets , with rates from 10 % to 35 % , it calls for just two : 10 % and 25 %			0
the proposal would eliminate the alternative minimum tax while dropping the top corporate tax rate from 35 % to 25 %			0
@entity6 leaders would compensate for lost revenue by closing a series of tax loopholes and ending numerous deductions			1
they have declined to offer any details , however , on exactly which loopholes and deductions would be affected , instead insisting that the matter will be taken up at the congressional committee level in the future			0
returning to one of the most controversial points from last year 's budget fight , the proposal includes dramatic changes to the @entity28 program			1
it would offer future seniors a choice of staying in the traditional fee - for - service plan or opting instead for a @entity28 - approved private plan , all of which would be available via a new @entity28 exchange			2
no matter which plan they chose , including the traditional @entity28 plan , seniors would receive a government subsidy to help pay for their choice			2
while @entity3 insist the change is necessary to ensure the program 's long - term fiscal viability , democrats accuse the @entity6 of trying to destroy a key legacy of president @entity163 's @entity162			2
the @entity80 " want @entity28 to wither on the vine , to die , " @entity2 minority leader @entity164 , @entity165 , said this month			1
@entity167 , which provides health coverage for the poor , would be converted under the @entity6 plan into a series of block grants for states			2
individual states would be empowered to tighten eligibility rules or revise enrollees ' cost - sharing obligations			0
the @entity6 proposal also protects defense spending by undoing a scheduled $ 55 billion cut in the @entity181 budget , replacing the reduction with cuts elsewhere			1
@entity21 has previously called the scheduled @entity181 cuts -- part of the agreement reached in last summer 's @entity187 -- " devastating to @entity75 's defense capabilities			2
" on thursday , @entity21 said senior military officials defending lower @entity181 spending proposals have not been honest			0
" we do n't think the generals are giving us their true advice , " he said , accusing them of following an administration line			0
" i think there is a lot of budget smoke and mirrors in the ( administration 's ) @entity181 budget , which is not really a true , honest and accurate budget			0
when you confront military experts -- retired or active -- they concede these things to us			0
" republicans would compensate for higher defense spending in part by requiring greater federal worker pension contributions and more means - testing of entitlement benefits			0
overall , @entity21 's plan caps 2013 domestic discretionary spending -- programs other than entitlements such as @entity216 and @entity28 -- at $ 1.028 trillion			1
@entity10 immediately cried foul when the new proposed cap was unveiled , noting that it 's nearly $ 20 billion below the total agreed to in last summer 's deficit reduction deal			1
@entity2 @entity6 leaders insist they can propose any amount under the $ 1.047 trillion level , because that figure simply represents the top limit for discretionary spending , not a level up to which @entity115 must spend			1
while the @entity80 ' proposed budget has no chance of becoming law , it could have a significant impact on this year 's presidential and congressional campaigns			1
@entity10 believe the proposed @entity28 changes in particular could damage @entity6 hopes in key swing states such as @entity237 , which has a large elderly population			1
numerous republicans , however , believe they 'll be rewarded for having the political courage to tackle politically sensitive issues			0
they also argue that it 's important to draw clear distinctions with @entity10 before voters go to the polls in november			1
@entity1 's @entity246 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 passes @entity6 rep. @entity21 's budget plan
@entity21 budget includes big changes in @entity28 , tax code
@entity10 say the plan would hurt the elderly and middle class
they argue that the plan is a betrayal of last year 's deficit reduction deal
