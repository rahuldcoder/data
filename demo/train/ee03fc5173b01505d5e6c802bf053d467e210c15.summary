@entity0 -- the son of a founder of the @entity5 militant group , @entity4 , tuesday told @entity1 that he was a spy for @entity6			1
for 10 years , @entity7 said he gathered information about @entity4 terrorist plots and fed them to @entity6 's domestic security service @entity12			1
@entity7 , in an exclusive interview with @entity1 's @entity14 , said he did it because he came to believe that @entity4 was practicing " exceptional cruelty " against its members and " killed people for no reason			1
" he has now written a book , " @entity7 " detailing his exploits from his new base in the @entity23 where he has lived since 2007			2
@entity1 could not independently confirm his story and @entity6 has refused to comment			1
in the @entity6 newspaper @entity25 , a former @entity6 handler said of @entity7 : " one insight of his was worth 1,000 hours of thought by top experts			1
" @entity7 told @entity1 : " they offered me to work for them			1
my goal was to be a double agent and attack them from the inside			0
" but then his views changed			0
watch the full interview here " after i was tortured by @entity12 i was transferred to prison [ where ] @entity4 tortured @entity4 members and i became confused who was really my enemy ... i accepted to meet @entity12			2
" @entity7 said he agreed to spy on @entity4 and that his decision was partly a moral one			1
" my people did not understand this			2
@entity12 is committed to a constitution but @entity4 targets civilians			2
there 's a difference between targeting a terrorist and civilians			0
" he said that in part his transformation was due to spiritual reasons			0
" later on , i became a @entity56 , during that time , the first few months , and i was convinced by the principle of loving your enemies			0
and i saw that my enemy , who i thought that they were my enemies , they had morality , they had their responsibilities more than my own people			0
" he added : " as a @entity12 agent , when i had information i helped arrest people , otherwise they hit randomly			0
when i specified a particular person i had a condition - not to kill that person ... " in 10 years working for @entity12 i am not responsible for killing one terrorist			1
i care about my people , my problem was their [ @entity4 ' ] ideology			1
his father , @entity76 , is serving time in an @entity6 prison			2
he recently wrote a letter from jail saying that the whole family " inclusively and exhaustively denounce our eldest son			0
" an attorney for the elder @entity7 obtained a statement last week from the father saying @entity4 knew of his son 's contact with @entity6 intelligence and adding that he " was not on any day an active member in the ranks of @entity4			1
" asked if he feels in danger because of what he 's done , @entity7 says he is not afraid			2
" death is not the worst thing that can happen to a human being , physical death			0
the worst , spiritual and soul death			0
this is what really scares me			0
" the @entity6 government , including @entity12 , has not offered @entity1 official comment , and his family has broadly denied his story			1
but an intelligence source told @entity14 that the core claims are true , this is a " modus operandi of how @entity6 agents work , " to penetrate the opposite side , to try to get as much information as possible			1
but the source added some of the high profile claims of thwarting terrorism or helping with high - level captures are " gross exaggerations			0
