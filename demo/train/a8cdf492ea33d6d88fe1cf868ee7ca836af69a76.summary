-- if you walk past the @entity4 family garage in @entity5 , @entity6 on a sunday afternoon , there 's every chance you 'll see a 10 - meter - long wing sticking out into the driveway , and a dad and his two kids building a peculiar transparent airplane			1
" we 've got pictures of it being built , where my son ... he was probably seven or eight when he 's holding the first part that we made , " says @entity4 , 44			1
" and then he 's 16 and taller than me when he 's holding the last parts			2
" " so all through their life , if they want to know where dad was , dad was probably in the garage , building his plane			0
" a peculiar obsession @entity4 is part of a small group possessed by a peculiar obsession			1
the plane he 's assembling at home has no engine -- none apart from the pilot 's cycling power , driving an oversized propeller			1
enthusiasts like @entity41 -- he mentions @entity42 in nearby @entity43 and @entity44 in @entity45 , and there are a scattering of others across the globe -- dream of flying as the first aeronautical test pilots once did : human - powered			1
" pure , " as @entity4 describes it			1
he recalls being a seven - year - old , himself , and trying to recreate the man - powered star of the @entity57 winning documentary flight of the @entity58 -- @entity61 dr. @entity60 's machine which took flight in the @entity63 in 1976			1
in model form , at least			0
the ungainly machine was the beginning of his fascination : " to look at it , it 's not elegant			2
to look at it , it 's not beautiful at all			2
it flies backwards , the elevator is at the front of the wing ... , " he describes			0
paper airplane -- made real at a glance , @entity4 's homemade creation is barely more substantial than the kitchen - cupboard replicas of his youth			1
despite its 22 - meter wingspan -- proportional to a small @entity85 that you might travel on holiday in , he notes -- his @entity88 weighs little more than 40kg			1
that 's about half @entity4 's bodyweight			1
@entity4 draws on the experience of his day job -- as an engineer on @entity96 's @entity95 engines -- to cut milligrams off weight by drilling out screws and forging hollow carbon tubes for the plane 's skeleton			1
beyond that , though , everything is store bought			0
the handcrafted amateurishness of it all is part of the appeal			2
@entity4 was never interested in shiny new jets , mass produced from precision laser cut parts by teams of professionals -- " that was n't flying as i wanted to experience flying			1
" @entity4 's design , for all the fine attention to detail , is all about making it up yourself , he says			1
and he is not embarrassed to admit that some fundamental details -- like whereabouts the all important center of gravity is -- " had just been wet finger guessed with a cup of tea in my hand			2
" just right preparing to attempt the first flight , @entity4 gave his plane a " 50 - 50 " chance of coming home in a black bin bag			1
everything had to be designed " on a knife edge " -- being just robust enough to hold together , while remaining light enough to leave the ground			0
toward the end of construction , he realized the main spar stretching across the back of the wing was coming in heavier than expected			0
he knew what he 'd have to do : " it put me on the best diet i have ever had ! so i lost 8 kilograms in weight to match the plane ! " he booked a week off work , hoping to return as anything other than the " laughing stock " he assumed he 'd be if his decade long quest failed			0
just days before the flight , the @entity41 family gazed out the window as buckets of rain fell			2
" my wife 's birthday is may 23rd , so i promised to avoid flying on her birthday			2
but as the weather happens to have it , the monday and tuesday were blowy and windy and wet , and the forecast on her birthday was beautiful			0
" so we dropped a few hints ... , " he smiles			0
the original dream of flight standing on the runway , that evening , as night fell , he gave himself a moment to admire his creation -- " it was light , it was elegant , it was complete			2
" pedaling and pedaling away , you can just ... it is really beautiful			0
" " all of a sudden you get to a certain speed and you just rise up			0
really smoothly -- no dramatic effort involved			0
" " you keep going , and it all goes quiet , and you are lifted up -- but you are lifted from your hips and your back so you are just cuddled up into the air , " he enthuses			0
the first flight was around 50 meters -- " not just a hop , " he says			1
" " it 's quite odd to be in a plane that you are pedaling : you are flying , but you can look down and see people , and you can look into the distance and there are birds flying along beside you			0
" " the day after our flight ... i drove to work and saw a buzzard just hovering			0
and i thought : ' yeah -- you and me , mate			0

@entity4 is part of a small group of amateurs obsessed with man - powered *aircraft*
his @entity208 is 22 - meters wide and can take flight under @entity4 's pedal - power
it is the hand - made aspect that most appeals to him
