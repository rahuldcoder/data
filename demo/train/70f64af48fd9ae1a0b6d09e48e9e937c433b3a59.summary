@entity0 -- @entity3 administration lawyers who wrote " torture " memos have been cleared of allegations of professional misconduct after a @entity9 internal investigation , which recommends no legal consequences for their actions			1
the report by the @entity9 concludes the high - ranking lawyers who developed controversial legal guidance on waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques may have exercised poor judgment , but not professional misconduct			1
the conclusion resulted from a decision by top career @entity9 executive @entity21 to reverse a recommendation of investigators that found the two lawyers ' legal memos did constitute professional misconduct			1
that tentative conclusion , which was overruled by @entity21 , said the lawyers should be referred to their state bar associations for potential disbarment			2
but in the final report , the examination of the legal guidance written by @entity9 lawyers @entity35 and @entity36 found they did not constitute a professional breach that could have led to state disbarment			1

" reaction to the @entity9 investigation largely fell along party lines , with @entity74 unhappy with the conclusions , and highlighting criticism of the @entity78 lawyers			0
" while the report concludes the lawyers did not breach their minimal professional obligations , i certainly hold top lawyers at the @entity9 ] to a higher standard than that , as all @entity87 should , " said rep. @entity79 , @entity80			2
@entity79 , who chairs the @entity88 focused on the lawyers ' " poor judgments , " and said , " today 's report makes plain that those memos were legally flawed and fundamentally unsound			0

" it is important that future government lawyers know that their efforts to protect @entity87 will not be criminalized by future administrations , " said rep. @entity98 , @entity99 , the top @entity100 on the @entity88			0
