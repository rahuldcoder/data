-- a few months after four @entity4 police officers were arrested for allegedly targeting and harassing @entity5 , @entity2 's state legislature passed a bill monday to beef up safeguards against racial profiling			1
titled " @entity11 , " @entity10 mandates that local and state law enforcement agencies adopt their own " written policy that prohibits the stopping , detention or search of any person when such action is solely motivated by considerations of race , color , ethnicity , age , gender or sexual orientation , and the action would constitute a violation of the civil rights of the person			1
" in addition , the legislation sets up reporting requirements for police whenever they conduct traffic stop , as well as a system for citizen complaints or for state authorities to collect and assess pertinent data from municipal departments			1
initially passed by the @entity41 on april 19 , the legislation made it through the @entity43 on monday and is now expected to be signed by gov. @entity44			1
" i will continue to insist that every effort is taken to protect individual rights in every community and that racial profiling is eliminated , " @entity45 said monday in a statement			1
" this is a real problem that deserves a real solution , and my administration is committed to carrying out the spirit and letter of this law			2
" if and when the bill goes into affect , those pulled over after january 1 , 2013 , would get a copy of the " standardized form " filled out by police containing details about the driver and circumstances of their case			2
those who feel they were profiled due to their race , color , ethnicity , gender or sexual orientation can file a complaint , which must be reviewed by the local police department and be passed on to a state agency			2
the bill does n't mention any locality or case specifically			0
but it follows the arrests , in january , of an @entity4 police sergeant and three officers following a federal investigation into racial profiling			1
they all pleaded not guilty			0
a civil lawsuit has also been filed related to that case			0
according to a federal indictment , the four allegedly conspired to " injure , oppress , threaten and intimidate various members of the @entity4 community " by profiling @entity95 residents during traffic stops , performing illegal searches and harassing latino business owners and their advocates			1
the men allegedly threatened and assaulted detainees , made false arrests -- including a local clergy member -- and later conspired to cover up evidence of their conduct by falsifying reports and blocking an investigation , prosecutors said			0
the men also thwarted a police commission inquiry into their alleged misconduct , authorities said , calling on the support of local union leaders to block and intimidate municipal investigators			0
" they behaved like bullies with badges , " said @entity116 , assistant @entity117 director in @entity118			0
many @entity95 residents of @entity4 -- who make up about 10.3 % of the town 's roughly 29,000 people -- say that , for years , they have had to contend with an overly aggressive police force			1
" they always come by and bother us , " said @entity126 , a manager at @entity127 , a @entity95 - owned bar and restaurant named in the indictment			0
" police come in two or three times a month and ask everyone in the restaurant for their identification , " he said			0
" and if you do n't have it , they threaten us and say they 're going to call the immigration office			0
" the rev. @entity141 of @entity142 , a plaintiff in the civil suit , has accused since retired police chief @entity145 of fostering " a racist and dishonest police force " in @entity4 .			2

@entity2 's @entity43 passes an *anti-racial* profiling law
the state @entity41 earlier passed the bill ; the *governor* says he will sign it
it mandates police bar *discrimination* in who they stop , detain or search
months *ago* , 4 @entity4 police were arrested in a federal racial profiling probe
