a number of the world 's leading airlines on tuesday suspended flights to @entity5 's main airport after a rocket fired from @entity7 struck about a mile from its runways			1
the @entity10 ordered @entity12 airlines to stop flying to or from @entity14 's @entity13 for at least 24 hours , and the @entity15 issued a warning to its airlines to stop its flights			1
the action came just days after @entity20 was shot out of the sky over eastern @entity22 , where government troops have been battling @entity25 - backed separatists			2
the flight suspensions to @entity5 were the latest development in the 15 - day - old conflict between @entity5 and @entity29 militants in @entity7 , with neither side showing any sign of backing down			2
at least 41 rockets were fired from @entity7 toward @entity5 on tuesday , according to the @entity34			2
the @entity10 ordered @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 to suspend their flights to @entity14			1
" the notice was issued in response to a rocket strike which landed approximately one mile " from the airport tuesday morning , the @entity10 said			1
" ... the @entity10 will continue to monitor and evaluate the situation			1
updated instructions will be provided to @entity12 airlines as soon as conditions permit , but no later than 24 hours " from when the suspension was ordered			1
a number of @entity50 airlines as well as @entity51 suspended flights after an advisory issued by the @entity15			1
@entity15 " strongly recommends airspace users to refrain from operating to and from @entity14 @entity13 , " according to the advisory			1
as of tuesday evening , the @entity56 was showing a number of flight cancellations , but @entity59 and a handful of smaller airlines still appeared to be operating flights			2
operations at the airport in @entity14 continued tuesday after the @entity10 issued its order , according to @entity67 's @entity66 , who was reporting from @entity13			1
@entity66 said she saw a rocket being intercepted near the airport			1
" this is the environment that the planes are flying in and out of , " she said			2
the @entity56 said the @entity12 companies made the decisions on their own , and it urged them to reconsider , saying the airport was safe			1
" there is no reason that @entity12 carriers should stop flying to @entity5 and thus give a prize to terror , " it said			1
but aviation security consultant @entity82 called the decision by airlines to halt flights to @entity14 's airport for the moment " a prudent measure " that was likely influenced by the shooting down of the @entity92 jetliner over @entity22			1
" the airline must protect their passengers and their asset ( the airplane ) from death , damage and destruction , so they are n't going to fly into a location that they believe to be unsafe , " @entity82 said			2
" this is the same situation that airlines encounter during natural disasters like hurricanes , where the airlines move their aircraft out of harm 's way until the storm has passed			2
this is a storm of a different kind , and i think because of @entity115 people are more sensitive to their commercial flight flying over an area where military ordnance is being hurled around			0
" @entity35 and @entity119 , the parent company of @entity36 , both suspended service to @entity13 before the @entity10 notice was issued			1
the @entity123 has suspended flights to @entity5 for the next 36 hours , including @entity123 's @entity125 and @entity127 flights , according to a @entity123 official			2
@entity130 flag carrier @entity129 has canceled a flight to @entity5 that was due to depart tuesday evening			0
the company said it is still looking into whether future flights will be canceled			2
the airport is the premier gateway between @entity5 and the rest of the world			0
" perhaps no other airport in the world has been the focus of so many terror threats for so long			0
but @entity13 has a remarkable safety record			1
it is one of the most secure airports in the world , " said @entity67 anchor @entity143 , who previously spent three years as a @entity145 - based correspondent			1
" @entity5 has invested a lot to keep the airport safe , and many within @entity5 will be extremely concerned if it is now within reach of @entity29 rockets , " @entity143 said			0
@entity143 was on @entity155 , which was en route tuesday from @entity158 's @entity157 to @entity14 when it was diverted to @entity160 ' @entity159			1
it 's very unusual for the @entity10 to prohibit @entity12 carriers from flying to a particular airport , said @entity164 , a former @entity12 @entity166 inspector general , via e-mail			1
" the @entity10 does not like to restrict flight operations , " @entity164 said via e-mail			1
" in the past when the @entity10 has done it there have been diplomatic consequences			1
" the @entity20 17 tragedy last week likely affected the decision , she said			0
aviation security expert @entity177 agreed that @entity115 played a part in the decision to restrict flights			2
" another part of it is the actual war going between @entity29 and @entity5			0
@entity29 has displayed some surprises -- how many missiles they have and how far they can go			0
that explains why a number of ( airlines ) are getting out , " said @entity177 , director of terrorism , intelligence and security studies at @entity188			0
" it 's extremely , extremely difficult to protect a commercial aircraft , " he said			0
travel agents are scrambling to inform and rebook travelers			0
" we are in touch with all our clients , and we 're obviously helping to move them to another airline , " said @entity196 , owner of @entity197 in @entity198			0
@entity196 said her agency is working closely with @entity5 's @entity205			0
@entity205 continued to operate its regular schedule tuesday , including up to five flights a day from the @entity12 , according to the airline			1
@entity196 said she 's rebooking to an @entity205 flight a group of more than 100 travelers that was scheduled to fly @entity36 to @entity5 tuesday night			0
the flight suspensions come a day after the @entity214 asked @entity12 to consider deferring nonessential travel to @entity5 and the @entity216			1
monday 's travel warning reaffirmed existing guidance against any travel to @entity7 , which the @entity214 said " is under the control of @entity29 , a foreign terrorist organization			0
" the department urged @entity12 citizens already in @entity7 to depart immediately			2
other governments are cautioning their citizens against some or all travel to the region			0
