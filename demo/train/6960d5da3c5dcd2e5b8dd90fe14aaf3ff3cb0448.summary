-- this was @entity3 's first debate with front - runner status			1
that means it was his time to get grilled like a fine @entity8 steak			0
and i would n't say he came out of it like a filet			0
even though his rivals missed some opportunities to press their case against the former senator from @entity17 , @entity3 could n't escape the barbecue			2
it was his old nemesis , @entity20 , who had the most damning attacks			1
perhaps we should have expected @entity20 , who has been arguing with @entity3 ever since the first debates , to be the most prepared			1
after all , they have been sparring for more than six months			0
@entity20 began the debate by calling @entity3 a fake			1
and he did n't shy away from it			0
one issue was the fact that @entity3 voted for @entity31			1
@entity20 was arguing that @entity3 could n't control the deficit and cited the expense of @entity31 as one example			1
@entity20 's best line came after @entity3 compared his conservative record to other members of @entity38 -- the @entity40 lawmaker said the @entity42 people are sick of @entity38 , so it 's a " cop - out " to compare yourself to them			1
he said @entity3 had no credibility since he acted one way while in the @entity47 but argued for a different policy while running for president			2
i thought this was damning enough , but then later in the debate , @entity3 stepped in deeper when he said he voted for @entity31 even though it was against his beliefs , calling politics a team sport and saying he had been supporting president @entity57 in that vote			1
i do n't think he understood that he fed right into the critique @entity20 was making about @entity3 's credibility and sticking with principle			1
( did anyone find it ironic that the one word @entity3 used to describe himself in the debate was " courage " ? ) @entity20 countered that the idea of " team sport " is the problem with @entity70			1
@entity72 's obligation should be to his or her oath of office and not to the party			0
there was another moment when @entity20 was on the offensive but failed to take full advantage of his position			2
@entity20 reminds me of so many debaters i 've watched over the years who see an opening but do n't quite know what to do with it			2
@entity20 correctly noticed a problem with @entity3 's support for @entity89 , which funds family planning programs , coupled with @entity3 's braggadocio solution of creating and voting for @entity93 abstinence programs			1
to his credit , @entity20 mentioned that @entity93 costs money too and , in his view , also overstepped the bounds of the federal government 's rightful role			2
but he could have completed the argument with just a bit more thought			0
i 've always loved the " rephrase " in debates			0
it is an incredibly effective and persuasive tool			0
i wanted to see @entity107 's position			0
watch how easy it would have been : " @entity3 now claims that he voted for one costly and intrusive measure ( @entity89 ) but made up for it by introducing another costly and intrusive measure ( @entity93 )			2
only in @entity70 do two wrongs make a right			0
" @entity3 was in a trap , but @entity20 did n't know how to spring the dang thing			1
while the attacks weakened @entity3 's debating performance , there were even more missed opportunities to score against him			1
these @entity121 presidential debates have demonstrated that it usually takes at least two full debates of being the front - runner before your opponents figure out the most effective attacks			1
think back to @entity128 and 9 - 9 - 9 ( seems so long ago ) , or to @entity129 and the @entity130 debates or to @entity132 and the @entity133 debates			2
each time a front - runner was singled out by multiple other candidates over a series of debates , that front - runner faltered			1
but 9 - 9 - 9 , " @entity140 " and moon colonies were all ideas that escaped their first debate critiques before being skewered in a second attempt			0
my point is that @entity3 is fortunate there are n't any more debates before @entity148 , because i think the other candidates would fare even better			1
@entity3 had a couple of weaknesses in this debate that were n't challenged enough			2
these include the role of women in combat ( where he all but said he would overrule the decisions of the military leaders if he disagreed with them ) , his vote in support of the " @entity159 " ( in how many elections will this be an issue ? ) and his oddly contradictory stance on contraception ( he is against it while railing on the negative consequences of teen pregnancy and children born out of wedlock )			0
on wednesday night , @entity3 was on the defensive , and so he was unable to make his best case for president			0
@entity174 , @entity129 and @entity20 all succeeded because they had strong debates , and they stayed , for the most part , out of the fire			2
there 's only one debate left on the schedule , march 19			0
if it takes place , who will the front - runner be by then ? whoever it is , he will need to be more prepared to debate in my backward - step - pivot - forward technique			1
the football adage is that defense wins championships , and that could be the case			0
but it sure does n't win any presidential debates			0
join the conversation on @entity198			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			0

debate coach @entity201 : as new front - runner , @entity3 faced his turn to be grilled
he says *ex-senator* appeared *inconsistent* on issues such as @entity31 vote
@entity20 's attacks on @entity3 effective but could have been even *sharper* , @entity201 says
@entity201 : @entity3 is lucky there are no more debates before @entity148
