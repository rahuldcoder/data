-- eight years ago , the @entity2 presidential candidates had the luxury of running against @entity4			1
their main foreign - policy message was that they were different from the incumbent : they were against the war in @entity9 ; against the way @entity4 was conducting the war on terrorism ; against his unilateral approach to world affairs			1
in 2016 , things will be different			2
the candidates will have to be much more careful about distancing themselves from president @entity19 's policies			2
while they will be able to critique him and highlight how they would try do better , they will also face great pressure to outline their own visions for their future			0
the task wo n't be easy , since the @entity2 is not all on the same page			2
while philosophical fractures within the @entity29 are well - known -- among neo-isolationists like sen. @entity31 and hawkish conservatives like sen. @entity33 -- there are also deep divisions and tensions within the @entity2 that candidates will have to sort out			2
a number of foreign - policy agendas have taken shape among the @entity2 , and all are likely to be part of the debate in the primary season			1
there are the liberal internationalists , arguably the most dominant voice among @entity2			1
they include the president , former secretary of state @entity48 , vice president @entity49 and secretary of state @entity50 , who believe that the @entity51 must remain active overseas to maintain global order and protect @entity51 interests			1
@entity55 internationalists believe that it is essential to work through international institutions like @entity58 or the @entity59 rather than to go it alone			1
they accept the need for military force , but also insist on the use of diplomacy and economic sanctions			0
another pillar of liberal internationalism is that public sacrifice is needed when the nation goes to war , through higher taxes , volunteerism or , in earlier times , a draft			2
there is also a strong anti-war faction that has been a central part of @entity2 politics since the 1960s			2
for these democrats , who are based primarily in the grass roots rather than among @entity85 elites , military force should be used only under the most extreme circumstances			0
they tend to distrust what elected and military officials say when justifying the use of force , always remembering the lies of @entity93			0
this world view posits that military force is very often a poor method for handling international problems and creates more problems than it is worth			0
this view rarely finds mainstream candidates , since these arguments play into conservative claims that @entity2 are weak on defense			2
but occasionally their voice is heard			0
in 2004 , gov. @entity106 of @entity107 made this argument about @entity9			0
today , some wonder whether possible candidates like gov. @entity111 of @entity112 , sen. @entity113 of @entity107 or sen. @entity114 of @entity115 might position themselves that way			0
finally , there are the liberal hawks			1
this faction has been much less vocal since the negative fallout from president @entity4 's war in @entity9 but still lurks in the party			1
liberal hawks are more open than their colleagues to the use of military force , even unilaterally , and less concerned about national sacrifice			1
the tradition was made famous by @entity85 sen. @entity129 , who in the 1970s was among the most prominent " neo-conservatives			0
" today some observers see @entity2 who could succeed @entity129 like @entity134 sen. @entity133			0
" so my friends on the left need to understand , " he said , " that it is the world as it is , not as we wish it to be			0
" with the chaos overseas growing in cases such as @entity143 aggression and the rise of a so - called @entity146 state , they could become more of a force once again in the campaign			0
candidates wo n't have to choose one side or another , since most politicians do n't fit neatly into one category			1
but they will need to navigate carefully as they craft their message and figure out ways to develop a platform that can bring together as much of the party as possible			1
some possible candidates , such as @entity48 and former @entity161 sen. @entity160 , have an eclectic record that could enable them to appeal to multiple constituencies			0
the best candidates will be the one who can offer a coherent and powerful vision of what the @entity51 and the world should be as we enter into this period .			1

@entity172 : dems ca n't run against @entity4 foreign policy in 2016 , must have own vision
he says party divided on approach . one strain : liberal internationalists like @entity182 , @entity49
they think @entity51 must be globally active , work through @entity59 , @entity58 . another strain is anti-war
@entity172 : liberal hawks ' third approach . candidates must navigate these ideas toward a vision
