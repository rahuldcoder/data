@entity0 , @entity1 -- as he lies in bed , @entity4 's eyes flutter open			1
he gazes into his room but fixates on nothing			2
a stuffed toy lies motionless in his left hand			2
every two hours , a nurse turns him : first on his back , then to the right , then to the left			0
fourteen medications course through his gastrointestinal tube , given at different hours of the day			0
his parents or nurses monitor his oxygen levels , change his feeding bag , clean the various tubes that help him survive			1
all this is happening in his bedroom , in the same home where @entity4 grew up , learned to crawl , played with his dog and painted a @entity1 golden bear on his bedroom wall			1
this is also where his family hopes he will awake from his yearlong ordeal			0
the 17 - year - old is in a persistent vegetative state after a beach accident deprived his brain of oxygen for more than 15 minutes			1
@entity4 's parents , @entity37 and @entity38 , turned their own bedroom into a hospital ward for their eldest son			1
metal shelves in the room are stocked with adult diapers , splints , catheters and syringes			0
increasingly , families like the @entity49 are bringing children with complex medical needs home for long - term care			1
in previous decades , children with neurological injuries would stay in hospitals or other facilities for the rest of their lives			0
today , children are being moved through these institutions more quickly , said dr. @entity62 , director of the clinic for kids with special health care needs at @entity66			0
part of the reason is that children with these and other health issues are living longer thanks to medical advances			0
another reason for the change in care comes from the insurance companies ' refusal to pay for long inpatient stays , @entity73 said			0
children requiring long - term antibiotics , feeding tubes and / or ventilator support are now sent home with nursing care , rather than living months at a time in the hospital			1
" it has changed dramatically			0
so many things we used to keep kids in the hospital ( for ) , we can now take care of in the home instead			1
" @entity73 is the lead author of an article published in the journal @entity95 in april that outlines ways to transition complex pediatric patients home from the hospital			2
" we send very complicated kids home for their parents to take care of them , " @entity73 said			2
" this puts a huge amount of stress and responsibility onto parents			0
we realize this is an incredibly daunting task			0
" home care places demands on parents ' time and finances , as well as their emotional and physical well - being			1
the most complex patients can require 24 - hour nursing shifts , a rigorous medication schedule and various treatments			2
the cost can be staggering : @entity4 's monthly care is about $ 40,000			1
home care costs less than lengthy hospital stays , but it 's still a major expense			1
the state - funded @entity122 , known as @entity124 , covers @entity4 's home care			1
@entity4 's condition requires nurses or caregivers around the clock to place his legs in and out of splints , change his feeding bag and bathe him			1
" this is just a new life , " said @entity4 's father , @entity37			1
" i do n't look at it as any different than taking care of a normal child			0
" deeply religious , the @entity49 have faith that @entity4 will recover and wanted to bring him home so he would be in a familiar setting			1
throughout the day , his dad , mom and 15 - year - old brother @entity141 pop into @entity4 's room			1
a stream of visitors from his high school , youth group and lacrosse team stops by during the week			0
sometimes , his family watches football in his room , cheering for teams together			0
" we never considered not bringing him home , " @entity154 said			2
" home is where his family and friends are and where he is most comfortable			2
our goal has always been to bring him home when it was safe to do so			2
" the toll of caregiving can be intense , but parents are often willing to make the sacrifice			0
" it 's their child			2
they love them , " said @entity73 , who has seen many parents take their children home			2
" they want them to be part of their lives			0
" @entity4 always had an easygoing swagger , said his mother , @entity178			1
he aspired to study civil engineering and wanted to go to the @entity180 , like his dad			0
fascinated by architecture , he would build model structures and houses			0
as an infant , he played baby jesus in his local @entity187 , and as a teen , he would strum his guitar playing gospel songs for his church youth group			0
teachers would rave about how much they loved him , said @entity141 , who shared a room with @entity4 for most of their lives			1
" i feel like if i did n't have my brother ( growing up ) , i 'd be a mess , " he said			0
" he kind of showed me the ropes and everything			0
i always wanted to do everything my brother did			0
" in june 2011 , the brothers and about 50 kids from their church went on a supervised youth retreat near @entity205 , @entity1			0
on a saturday afternoon , @entity4 and his friends started digging a sand tunnel on @entity208			1
scooping the sand with their bare hands and @entity213 , they created an underground passage about 10 feet wide and 7 feet deep			0
it was about 4 p.m. when @entity141 heard one of his friends shout : " @entity141 , your brother is under the sand ! " the tunnel had collapsed , trapping @entity222			1
there was no sign of him			0
teens were screaming , and everyone dropped to the ground , frantically clawing at the sand with their hands to find @entity4 , @entity141 recalled			1
he dropped to his knees and prayed to @entity231 : " lord , if you can do anything , please take him out now			0
i do n't want my brother to die			0
" by the time rescuers reached @entity4 , he was unconscious			1
but his heart was beating			0
weeks after the accident , the diagnosis became clear : @entity4 was in a persistent vegetative state because he had been deprived of oxygen for 15 to 20 minutes			1
a month later , doctors asked the @entity49 whether they should resuscitate him the next time @entity4 's life was in jeopardy			1
" we have hope that he could still recover , " his mother told the doctors			0
" you 're going to do everything you can for our son to keep him alive			2
" after months in hospitals and other institutions , his family brought him home in february			2
" he seems more comfortable , relaxed at home , " his dad said			2
doctors say it 's notoriously difficult to predict the outcome of neurological injuries , especially those stemming from oxygen deprivation			1
without oxygen , brain cells die within a few minutes , causing extensive damage			1
the situation is dire in most cases , yet no one really knows why a very small fraction of patients emerge from comas			0
" when it comes to neurology , there 's so much unknown , " said dr. @entity271 , a brain surgeon and professor at @entity274 who is not involved in @entity4 's care			1
" we do n't have any statistics			0
it 's very , very rare to be in a vegetative state for a long period of time and wake up			1
" still , the @entity49 continue to hope			1
the uncertainties and caregiving responsibilities they face are often overwhelming , but the @entity49 say they believe that choosing to sustain his life and bringing him home was best for @entity4			1
every day , @entity141 pokes his head into @entity4 's room , which is right next to the bedroom they used to share			1
having " @entity295 " at home brings a " sense of normalness , " @entity141 said			2
he usually recounts to his brother what happened during each day and even pokes fun of him like he used to			0
" i look at him now , and i realize that 's the same exact kid , " @entity141 said			2
" why ca n't he be like the way he was before ? " the @entity49 have set up a website , the @entity305 , where you can learn more about @entity4 and how to help			1
@entity2 's @entity307 contributed to this story .			2

the 17 - year - old was without oxygen for more than 15 minutes
the @entity49 are caring for their son , who 's in a persistent vegetative state , at home
