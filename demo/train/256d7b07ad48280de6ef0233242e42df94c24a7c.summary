-- i am a geomorphologist : a scientist fascinated by the interactions of storms , floods , fires and landslides			1
we humans may feel a bit above that fray -- we refer to the " natural environment " as though it were a separate thing			1
yet , as a landslide near @entity14 , @entity15 , tragically highlighted on saturday , we remain subject to the forces of nature like all the rest of @entity20 's creatures			1
at the latest count , 27 people are confirmed dead and 22 are still missing			1
a painful part of the natural order of things			1
unlike those other inhabitants of @entity20 , however , we know something of how things work			2
this , too , was highlighted last week , when the @entity30 reported on a study i did 15 years ago , one of many for the @entity36 site , which had experienced recurring landslides			1
in that study , conducted for the @entity39 , i had written of the possibility of a " large catastrophic failure " based on numerical analyses that indicated potential instability of a huge mass of material above the zone of previous landslides			1
as a scientist , i knew that material would someday be on the valley floor			2
as intended , that report guided further work			2
@entity53 , an engineer who reported on the site for the @entity39 , was also clear that " catastrophic failure potential places human lives and property at risk			1
" he came up with designs to shore up the slope			1
those designs were put in place ; everything was done that could be done to minimize the potential of a future landslide			1
a pleasant rural neighborhood , @entity69 , sat directly across the river from the site			1
@entity53 's most relevant design to protect lives was to try to buy up the properties and move people away			1
there were meetings to discuss these ideas , but nothing came of them			2
i was n't involved in the discussions , but i did attend a community meeting to discuss my analyses -- after a landslide in 2006 felled trees and crashed into the @entity87 of the @entity88 across the valley into the edge of @entity69			1
one response to my presentation , i was told , was that i was there to take their land			2
construction of new homes continued , even after 2006			1
in some cases , people were informed of the risk , but did n't trust the messenger , or decided it was an acceptable risk			1
i learned that some people were unaware that they lived across the river from an active landslide			2
i 've been asked , " where does responsibility lie ? " the cast is large			2
homeowners choose to live in beautiful , but dangerous , places			1
contractors and developers then build those homes , @entity114 sell them , bankers finance them , local officials grant permits , governments set zoning rules , and voters elect the officials who make those rules			2
at every step , those decisions need to be made from positions of knowledge and understanding of the potential consequences			1
then who is responsible to ensure that scientific findings are disseminated and clearly understood ? the scientists ? the government ? the media ? we can not help those lost at @entity14 , but we can look to do better in the future			2
this is not the last landslide , flood , fire , hurricane , earthquake , tsunami , drought , tornado , or any of a long list of threatening events that we face			2
scientists work hard to understand these processes ; we need to ensure that everyone makes decisions fully aware of the potential consequences of their actions			1
we have work to do			0
i 'm getting calls from concerned homeowners wanting to know where to get information			1
it 's not easy to find			0
landslide hazards have not been systematically mapped across the state , much less the country			0
where work has been done , maps are hard to find			0
if found , they are difficult to interpret			0
many local , state and federal agencies are working to improve this situation , but progress is slow and funding is tight			0
mapping hazards is not a national priority			0
yet it seems that , if my smartphone can tell me how to drive to the nearest coffee shop , it should be able to tell me what 's known about the hazards where i 'm standing			0
we have the technology ; we need the public interest to drive the required investment			0
like most scientists , i toil in obscurity to make my small contribution			0
maybe we scientists are missing the point			0
the problem with toiling in obscurity is that no one hears us			0
we need better special effects			0
getting our messages across can save lives , although it will involve getting houses off flood plains , coastal bluffs and debris - flow fans			0
in general , folks do n't appreciate having a scientist , or government official , suggest they move			1
perhaps there is another approach			0
it took a massive information campaign to dramatically cut consumption of cancer - causing cigarettes , surely we can motivate people to examine the facts in this case and do things that are ultimately good for all of us			0
in 1997 , a colleague and i co-founded a small not - for - profit institute seeking to provide land managers with the data and tools they need to make informed decisions			0
we both had young children ; we saw it as a way to help ensure their generation would have something worth managing			0
that 's gone well , but our targeted audience is too small and public funding too limited			0
to really change things , everyone should have the tools and data to make informed decisions , and use them			0
for that to happen , these tools need to be as cool and easy to use as the latest smartphone app ; lives depend on it .			0

@entity241 predicted possible catastrophic *mudslide* in @entity15 15 years ago
@entity241 : engineers tried to shore up site and offered to buy out homeowners in danger
@entity241 : despite *warnings* , construction went on ; some did n't realize there was a risk
he says *assessments* of danger should be *readily* available to potential homeowners
