@entity0 -- the @entity0 humanitarian chief wednesday criticized a two - day pause in the fighting between the @entity6 army and @entity8 rebels as " inadequate			1
" @entity10 humanitarian chief @entity9 said he would have liked a " proper humanitarian pause			1
" @entity9 , the under secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator , told reporters that the 48 - hour break in hostilities was not sufficient , even as fighting resumed in the northeast of the country			1
the brief cessation of hostilities was announced by the @entity6 government on april 12 and allowed the @entity0 and its partners to bring in necessary aid , said @entity9			1
he said he would have liked a " proper humanitarian pause " that lasted longer than two days , but hoped the break allowed for some progress to occur			2
secretary - general @entity28 had originally welcomed the announcement by the @entity6 government			1
however , @entity28 also expressed his concern that , " this is less than the full humanitarian pause of several days i had pressed for			2
" but @entity28 added that the pause " is nevertheless a useful first step and an opportunity to move towards the peaceful and orderly end to the fighting now so badly needed			0
" the government of @entity6 has been battling the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) rebels in a civil conflict that has lasted nearly 25 years			1
the @entity40 has been declared a terrorist organization by 32 countries , including the @entity45 and the nations of the @entity47			0
as many as 70,000 people have been killed since the conflict officially began in 1983			0
the most pressing concern now , according to @entity9 , is the fact that over 100,000 people are currently crowded in a " very small pocket of land " that is about five square miles , or about twice the size of @entity58 's @entity57			0
" it is a very small area indeed for what we believe is very large number of people " @entity9 explained			0
the crowded population , primarily comprised of @entity66 civilians , is subject to the continuing @entity6 government assaults			2
the @entity69 and @entity70 foreign ministers released a joint statement as well on wednesday , claiming that the @entity40 is also using @entity66 civilians as human shields			0
@entity9 also called attention to the fact that the press has been barred from covering the civil strife in @entity6			0
ultimately , @entity9 and the @entity0 would like to see a peaceful end to the hostilities , but " its pretty clear , frankly , that a ceasefire as such is not something available at present circumstances			2
