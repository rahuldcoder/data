-- today 's world increasingly challenges us to think differently about value and money			0
how important is your reputation ? does it have an impact on your finances ? what is the currency of reputation and is it transferable or exchangeable ? how is reputation created ? reputation is co-created by individuals having experiences			1
looking for a great @entity19 restaurant for dinner tonight ? search @entity22 reviews and see what people who have already dined at a place have to say about it			0
want to know what it 's like to work with a potential hire ? read their @entity32 referrals			0
wondering whether or not other people are happy with a product you 're about to buy ? @entity37 reviews will tell you			0
you 've probably even shared your own experiences with something you enjoyed or warned others about a less - than - positive experience			0
your @entity45 score in the @entity46 measures your credit risk , which is really credit reputation , based on your behavior			1
reputation is crucial for the new economics of the ' @entity51 ' reputation is a requirement of the sharing economy			1
for @entity57 hosts and @entity59 and @entity60 drivers , positive ratings are paramount to their success			1
it might seem crazy to stay at a stranger 's house , but on @entity57 host reviews facilitate trust among strangers			1
your @entity57 , @entity22 and @entity69 reviews have immense values outside their immediate platforms			1
even though these reputation systems have been created for the specific company -- imagine how powerful it would be to have your reputation in one place			2
@entity59 and @entity60 are both independent operator ride - sharing platforms			1
both companies facilitate the connection between driver and passenger			0
drivers must be reviewed and approved before giving rides through their system			0
in a move to gain more drivers and compete with @entity60 , @entity59 reportedly offered bonuses to tempt already - approved @entity60 drivers to the @entity59 platform			1
in some cases , it was apparently easier for a new driver to go through the @entity60 approval process and then switch companies , than it was to apply directly to @entity59			1
reputation and the future reputation will become an increasingly visible part of our everyday transactions			2
while we will create reputation on individual platforms , there will be an increasing demand for fluid exchange of reputation and ratings from one system to another			2
we 'll see tools to aggregate your reputation in one place			2
we may even see reputation system apis developed to enable the transfer of your reputation to new platforms			2
picture this : four friends having dinner in a restaurant in the not - too - distant future			0
after the meal , they pay using a " @entity125 , " using integrated mobile payments , credit cards and private coins			0
as part of the @entity125 experience , diners can rate their experience immediately -- everything from individual dishes , the service , and even the restaurant itself			0
or how about this -- it 's the year 2020 and a woman is searching for a motorcycle at an online classified site			0
as part of her search results , the seller 's reputation is shown			2
this makes it easy to decide which seller to deal with			0
beyond these scenarios , expect to see more fluid exchange of reputation between their original systems -- akin to monetary exchanges			2
we 'll see more of personal reputation integrated in person - to - person transactions , which will enable deeper transactions in the resource sharing economy			1
