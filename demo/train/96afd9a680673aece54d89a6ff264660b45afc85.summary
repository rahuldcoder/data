editor 's note : @entity2 is a fellow at the @entity3 , a @entity4 - based think tank that promotes innovative thought from across the ideological spectrum and at @entity8 's @entity7			1
he 's the author of " the @entity9 : an @entity11 's leader			0
" @entity2 says deals with the @entity13 could further destabilize the situation in @entity15			1
( @entity16 ) -- it is a longstanding cliché that there is no military solution in @entity15 , only a political one			2
linked to this is the newer , related notion , rapidly becoming a cliché , that the @entity24 should start making deals with elements of the " reconcilable " @entity13			2
as with many clichés , there is some truth to both these notions , but neither of these comforting ideas are a substitute for a strategy that is connected to what is happening on the ground in @entity15 and @entity36			2
sunday 's @entity37 ran an interview with president @entity39 in which he said that , just as the @entity24 had made peace agreements with @entity42 militias in @entity43 , " there may be some comparable opportunities in @entity15 and in the @entity36 region			2
" he also cautioned that this could be " more complex " than was the case in @entity43			0
it 's not only going to be more complex , but doing deals with the @entity13 today could further destabilize @entity15			1
before getting to why that is the case , let 's stipulate first that there are always going to be some local commanders of the @entity13 who can be bribed , coerced or otherwise persuaded to lay down their arms			2
in fact , the @entity15 government already has had an amnesty program in place for @entity13 fighters for four years			1
thousands of the @entity13 already have taken advantage of the amnesty , a fact that tends to be glossed over in most of the recent discussions of the issue			2
that being said , there are nine reasons why doing deals with most of the various factions of the insurgencies in @entity15 and @entity36 that are labeled " the @entity13 " are more in the realm of fantasy than a sustainable policy			1
first , the @entity15 government is a sovereign entity and any agreements with the @entity13 must be made by it			1
right now the weak and ineffectual @entity15 government is in no position to negotiate with the @entity13 , other than to make significant concessions of either territory or principle , or both			1
second , while @entity39 did n't talk about dealing with @entity13 leader @entity83 , it is worth pointing out the @entity13 leadership , including @entity83 , has in the past several months taken every opportunity to say that it has no interest in a deal with the @entity15 government			1
and just last week , @entity83 urged the @entity36 @entity13 to refocus their efforts on attacking @entity24 and @entity91 forces in @entity15			1
those statements should be taken at face value			0
third , @entity83 's intransigence is utterly predictable			0
he was prepared to sacrifice his regime on the point of principle that he would not hand over @entity9 after 9/11			0
this does not suggest a @entity101 realism about negotiations , but rather a fanatical devotion to his cause			0
fourth , the @entity13 believe they may be winning in @entity15 , and they also are confident that they are not losing , which for an insurgent movement amounts to the same thing			1
they see no need to negotiate today when they can get a better deal down the road			0
fifth , the @entity13 leadership is largely in @entity36			1
side deals done with the @entity15 @entity13 will have little or no effect on the fact that the command and control of the insurgency is in another country			1
@entity124 , when @entity36 's government has done " peace " deals with the @entity13 in the @entity36 tribal regions in 2005 and 2006 and in the northern region of @entity130 earlier this year , they were made following military setbacks by @entity36 's army			1
those deals then allowed the militants to regroup and extend their control over greater swaths of @entity36 territory			0
why would new agreements with the @entity13 on either side of the @entity15 - @entity36 border yield different results ? @entity143 , " reconcilable " @entity15 @entity13 leaders have already reconciled to the government			1
@entity145 , the former foreign minister who met with @entity15 government officials in @entity147 in september , to discuss some kind of agreement with the @entity151 administration , was a foe of @entity9 's long before 9/11 and was never a hard - liner			1
@entity145 has no standing today with @entity13 leaders , who have been waging war now for 7½ years against @entity151 , and who quickly denied they were in any negotiations with his government			1
@entity161 , while the @entity13 was never a monolithic movement , it is much closer to @entity11 today than it was before 9/11			0
yes , there are local groups of the @entity13 operating for purely local reasons , but the upper levels of the @entity13 have morphed together ideologically and tactically with @entity11			0
@entity168 , for instance , the leader of the @entity36 @entity13 , sent suicide attackers to @entity170 in january 2008 , according to @entity170 counterterrorism officials , and sees himself as part of the global jihad			0
the @entity175 family , arguably the most important component of the insurgency on both sides of the @entity15 - @entity36 border , has ties with @entity9 that date back to at least 1985 , according to the @entity182 journalist @entity181 , who has known the @entity11 leader for more than two decades			0
@entity184 , a commander allied to the @entity13 , has been close to @entity9 since at least 1989 , according to militants who know both men			0
@entity187 was founded in @entity36 two decades ago , and @entity9 has been fighting alongside @entity15 mujahedeen groups since the mid- 1980s			0
@entity189 on the @entity15 / @entity36 border is much less of a " foreign " group with far deeper and older roots in the region than @entity187 ever was in @entity43			0
the @entity13 's rhetoric is now filled with references to @entity43 and @entity195 in a manner that mirrors @entity9 's public statements			2
the use of suicide attacks , improvised explosive devices and the beheadings of hostages -- all techniques that @entity11 perfected in @entity43 -- are methods that the @entity13 have increasingly adopted in @entity15 and have grown exponentially there since 2005			1
ireport.com : should there be a deal with the @entity13 ? one could go on listing examples of the @entity13 's ideological and tactical collaboration with @entity11 , but the larger point is that separating @entity11 and the @entity13 is not going to be as relatively simple as splintering @entity43 insurgent groups from @entity11 in @entity43			1
and ninth , unlike @entity187 in @entity43 , which was a foreign - led group that sought to impose , unpopular @entity13 - style rule on @entity42 areas of @entity43 , the @entity13 in @entity217 areas of @entity15 and @entity36 are not outsiders , but are often neighborhood people whose views about religion and society are rooted in the values of the @entity217 countryside			2
while , of course , the @entity24 should be splintering , buying off and co-opting as many elements of the @entity13 as possible , @entity24 officials also need to be realistic about how much closer @entity187 and the @entity13 have grown together in recent years , and the fact that the insurgency has mushroomed in size on both sides of the @entity15 - @entity36 border			2
@entity233 once observed that " it 's better to jaw - jaw than to war - war			0
but " jaw - jaw " with the @entity13 wo n't work if they think they are winning as they do right now			1
the @entity39 administration has ordered 17,000 additional @entity24 soldiers to go to @entity15 this year			0
as a result , two @entity246 brigades and a mobile , well - armored @entity244 will deploy into the heart of the @entity13 insurgency in southern @entity15			2
@entity246 and @entity244 brigades are not the kind of units you send in to play nice			0
those deployments strongly suggest that for all the public discussion of negotiations with the @entity13 the decision already has been made that any such negotiations should precede from a position of strength rather than weakness			0
these comments are , in part , based on @entity2 's testimonybefore the @entity24 @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 on @entity268 and foreign affairs on march 4			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : idea of dealing with moderate @entity13 is gaining more support
@entity2 says it 's not likely to be a strategy for *success* in the @entity279 war
@entity13 leadership thinks it 's winning the war and wo n't cut a deal , he says
@entity284 : @entity15 government too weak to engage in *meaningful* talks
