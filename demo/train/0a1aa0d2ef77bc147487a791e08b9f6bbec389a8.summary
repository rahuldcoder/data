@entity0 -- actor @entity2 is visibly moved when asked to read an excerpt of remarks made more than a half - century ago by the man he now portrays onstage , the legendary @entity5			1
the @entity8 attorney was arguing before the @entity10 @entity9 in 1958 over whether @entity12 , @entity13 , officials essentially had to follow the order of the courts to desegregate its schools			1
@entity5 , a sharp lawyer , turned the tables on the all - white bench , making the issue not about black students seeking equality but about society 's larger civic responsibilities			1
" education is not the teaching of the three @entity24 is the teaching of the overall citizenship			0
to learn to live together with fellow citizens , and above all , to learn to obey the law , " @entity5 told the court			1
" i worry about the white children in @entity12 who are told as young people that the way to get your rights is to violate the law and defy the lawful authorities			0
i am worried about their future			0
i do n't worry about those @entity42 kids ' future			0
they 've been struggling with democracy long enough , they know about it			0
" @entity2 commands the stage as the first @entity48 on the @entity9 in a new one - man play " thurgood " for a one - month engagement at the @entity52 in @entity0			1
" powerful stuff , " he said about hearing @entity5 's own words in the rarely heard audio argument of @entity55 v. @entity56			1
the 48 - year - old actor thoroughly researched this role , but he was unaware of this all - but forgotten chapter in @entity5 's colorful life			1
" before i read the script for ' thurgood ' , i knew nothing about @entity5 , " he said , sitting comfortably in a lounge just off the @entity63			1
" he was a very , very funny man			2
he was also a very serious man when it came time to be serious			2
i think he understood there was a time and a place for all kinds of behavior from human beings , and he indulged in those things at the appropriate times , " laughing loudly			0
it takes a good man with an unwavering dose of self - confidence to stand alone on a stage for 90 minutes straight , and portray a giant of @entity10 history			1
@entity2 offers a little secret to making it work			1
" the wonderful thing about this piece even though it 's a one - man show , i have a scene partner			1
my scene partner is the audience , " he said			0
" so that makes it really important for me to be paying attention and seeing how people respond			0
" @entity2 has won a @entity96 , an @entity97 and was nominated for an @entity98			1
the actor currently stars as a forensic investigator in " csi " on @entity102			2
he first did the role of @entity5 on @entity104 two years ago			1
after this @entity0 engagement , he takes " thurgood " to @entity106 and the @entity107			1
the creator of the show is @entity111 , who wanted to have @entity5 " make the case for himself , " with just one actor onstage			1
" one - hundred years after the end of slavery in the 1950s , he comes around and lives in a segregated society where people ca n't go to lunch counters , schools , swimming pools , all of that discrimination , housing , " @entity111 said			2
" and decides that you can use the law to change it			0
and that was such an act of imagination			0
and that gives purpose to the play , but it is his sense of humor			2
his sense of narrative throughout his life ; @entity5 was a storyteller			1
and that gives us so much to work with			2
" an example in the play has fishburne as @entity5 talking to his critics in the 1980s who thought he should leave the bench			1
" they said i was too old , too liberal , too tipsy , " says the character			0
" i 'd tell them , i accepted a lifetime appointment			0
i 'm staying for life			0
i expect to die at the age of 110			0
shot by a jealous husband ! " which prompts huge laughter			0
the play recounts through stories and anecdotes the remarkable journey of @entity5 , who was born in 1908 and grew up in segregated @entity160 , @entity161			1
he was rejected from the @entity163 law school because he was black , but after graduating from @entity164 at the head of his class , he became chief counsel of the @entity168 and won 29 of 32 cases argued before the high court			0
he later joined that bench in 1967 , retiring in 1991			0
@entity5 was in the news recently when president @entity173 nominated the justice 's former law clerk @entity174 to the @entity9			1
@entity174 recalled @entity5 playfully called her " @entity177 " during her 1988 - 89 clerkship			1
@entity2 was not the first choice to play the role			1
@entity111 had produced a 1991 television miniseries based on the landmark @entity182 case that ended public segregation			0
@entity5 was played then by @entity185 , who backed out of the current project			1
but @entity111 and director @entity188 saw something in @entity2			2
" he 's a compelling actor			2
and he 's of an age which i originally thought was perhaps too young to do this part , " said @entity111			2
" but i learned the opposite -- he can come out as the older @entity5			1
and when he goes back in memory to his younger days , he has the vitality that brings that alive			0
so he 's just a wonderful choice for this role			2
" dressed in comfortable red sneakers , light khakis and a casual blue shirt , @entity2 said the role is one of the greatest acting challenges he has ever faced			1
" it 's all there , " he said of @entity204 , whom he never met			2
" i mean , we deal with his flaws and we deal with his strengths , we deal with his history , we deal with his disappointments as well as his victories			0
so , it 's all there			0
it 's all there in the show			2
" the actor said it helped that @entity5 was a master storyteller , who combined wit with a touch of lingering bitterness over how he was treated as a black man			1
the story @entity111 and @entity2 weave is more than a history lesson about race , but both men said @entity5 's humanity makes it instantly relatable to a wide audience			1
" it is a uniquely @entity10 life , " @entity2 said			2
" the last thing that he says in the play , he quotes [ poet ] @entity239 , and he says ' @entity10 will be			0
' this is a work in progress , that this is the great experiment			0
and that we all have a stake in it			0
that we are all sort of in a way responsible for realizing it			0
whether we accept that responsibility or not , the fact of the matter is we 're all here together			0

show 's creator : " @entity5 was a storyteller . and that gives us so much to work with "
