-- there were always three possible scenarios for @entity4 gov. @entity3 and @entity5 : one , that he was explicitly involved in the shutting down of three lanes feeding the @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity4 , as political retribution against a no - name mayor who did n't endorse him in an election @entity3 ran away with			1
two , that he was marginally involved , in that he told staffers to " take care of " the problem mayor but was n't specific about the actions to take			2
and three , that he was n't involved at all ; that an appointee at the @entity20 and staffers in his office cooked this up unbeknownst to him , did n't tell him and repeatedly lied to him about their involvement until e-mails proved otherwise			2
wednesday , many assumed the third option impossible , admittedly including me			0
it 's @entity3 , we said			1
it 's politics , we said			2
it 's ... @entity4 , we said			2
nonetheless , that 's exactly the story @entity34 going with , and in his two - hour news conference , he did a tremendous job convincing me , at least , that he really was blindsided by the news			1
and as apologies go , he hit all the right notes : i 'm sorry			1
he stuck around for an hour and a half answering reporter questions			0
he admitted the buck stops with him			0
he fired two staffers immediately			0
he said he planned on meeting with the jilted @entity10 mayor and with @entity10 residents to apologize directly to them			0
in contrast to other well - known news conferences , it was one of the best mea culpas in recent memory			0
but he 's not out of the woods yet			0
democrats would very much like to hang @entity3 on this , and they will not be satisfied with the " it was n't me " defense			1
if there 's any dirt , any inkling that he had knowledge of this , they 'll find it and destroy him over it			0
this is sure to be a sideshow for the next few weeks , if not months , as investigators look into exactly how this happened			0
and even if it turns out @entity3 's hands are clean , it still wo n't paint a pretty picture of politics in @entity77			1
he 's also heading up the @entity79 , a post that requires him to regularly raise funds and speak alongside other @entity79 governors			0
@entity3 said in his news conference that this would n't affect his job at the @entity79 , but that 's pretty naive			1
what governor wants to share a stage , at least in the short term , with a guy embroiled in a seedy , petty political scandal ? in the long term , however , if @entity3 is telling the truth , this is perfectly survivable			1
if he 's not ... well today 's performance was @entity98 - worthy -- and fatal			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity101			2

@entity101 saw three scenarios : 1 . @entity3 knew directly about *bridge* payback . 2 . he knew obliquely
third possibility : he was in the dark . she says this is the one he went with , convincingly
she says news conference hit all right notes ; *opponents* will still try to hang him with issue
@entity120 : if he 's telling truth , his career should survive ; if he is n't , issue will be fatal
