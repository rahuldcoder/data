-- @entity3 secretary of state @entity2 's claim that terrorists " can run but they ca n't hide " following two operations in @entity6 over the weekend is a reminder that @entity3 's military is increasingly active on the continent			1
it also raises questions about the international legality of such operations , and their long - term impact , especially in weak @entity17 states			0
in some cases @entity3 military engagements in @entity6 have already caused further instability rather than reducing the risks for international peace and security ? read more : should @entity3 fear @entity25 ? the @entity28 's @entity27 seizure of alleged @entity30 leader @entity29 , who was born @entity31 , in @entity32 is significant for @entity3 counter-terrorism efforts			1
a few months ago , president @entity34 and former president @entity35 attended a memorial service in @entity37 on the anniversary of the 1998 bombings of the @entity3 embassies in @entity41 and @entity42 that killed more than 220 people			2
@entity44 was allegedly the mastermind behind these bombings and has been one of the @entity3 's wanted men for the last 15 years			1
a second @entity3 military operation by @entity49 in @entity50 was aimed at capturing @entity52 militant leader said to be @entity53 , who also goes by @entity54 , the leader of @entity55 , the group that claimed responsibility for last month 's attack on the @entity59 shopping mall in @entity41			1
the operation was aborted under heavy armed fire during their amphibious assault			0
analysis : @entity55 breaks new ground the @entity50 operation is a reminder of how technically difficult such operations are and how accurate @entity3 intelligence needs to be			2
such operations though fit into a bigger picture of @entity3 and @entity73 counter-terrorism strategy in @entity6 , and how these poorly governed , fragile states provide havens and laboratories for terrorism franchises			1
listening to the difficulties that the @entity49 encountered in @entity50 , reminded me that october 3 , marked 20 years since 18 @entity3 soldiers and hundreds of @entity50 died in a battle that saw two @entity83 helicopters shot down over @entity84			2
this was seen at the time as one of the worst disasters in @entity3 military history			1
the result in 1993 was that @entity3 and international community left @entity50 to its own fate -- which over two decades has brought it back into the front - line of international counter-terrorism efforts			1
while the outcome in 1993 was disengagement , @entity3 engagement policy under president @entity35 in @entity50 to remove the @entity95 in late 2006 resulted in deepened radicalization and the rise of @entity55			0
similarly @entity73 policy toward @entity32 in 2011 , interpreting a narrow civilian protection @entity100 mandate for pushing for regime change resulted in the instability of @entity32 today , and the knock - on effects in the @entity106 , including the radical islamists capturing northern @entity108 until a @entity110 intervention loosened their hold on power earlier in 2013			0
counter-terrorism policies live on the edge of international law : extrajudicial killings by drones or proxy hit squads are clearly contentious and extraordinary renditions -- suspect - grabbing operations -- are unlawful			1
known extraordinary renditions in @entity6 have occurred in many @entity17 countries , including @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , the @entity128 , @entity41 , @entity32 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity42 , @entity50 , @entity6 and @entity132			0
the @entity34 administration has not publically stated if such operations continue			0
today the @entity3 military brief congress with maps showing an arc of instability by @entity52 terrorists from @entity50 and the @entity140 across the @entity106 and @entity141 to the @entity142 and @entity131			1
analysis : what 's behind @entity146 's wave of violence ? the mistake would be to regard this as a homogeneous threat			0
@entity25 in @entity146 is very different from @entity55 , which is different from @entity151			0
what is similar is that all these groups thrive in weakened and poorly governed states but the solutions are much more costly and long term : institution building , good governance and job creation			0
building up professional and accountable @entity17 militaries is only part of the solution and @entity73 efforts in @entity50 in support of the continental body the @entity166 have had success in combatting @entity55 and significantly weakening them , despite the @entity59 attack in @entity41			1
it is though also pursuing policies that do not cause greater harm and radicalize further , as @entity3 strategy toward @entity50 in 2006 did and arguably @entity3 , @entity110 and @entity175 policy did toward @entity32 in 2011			2
if we are to advocate good governance , and rule of law as the ultimate remedies , we should more assiduously find ways of ensuring our policies are values - led , rather than by interests			0
not forgetting the lessons learned from @entity50 and @entity32 about the unintended consequences of non-intervention and intervention is important if international efforts to counter terrorism in @entity6 in the long term are to be successful			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			0

@entity3 raids in @entity6 show that @entity3 's military is increasingly active on the continent
