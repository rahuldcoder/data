-- the secrecy surrounding " @entity2 , " due june 14 , is pretty extraordinary , but composer @entity3 was able to give @entity0 a glimpse of what to expect when we caught up with him this week regarding the score he did for " @entity10			1
" asked if the two projects had anything in common , since both involve a savior figure ( @entity16 , @entity17 ) sent by his father to @entity19 , @entity11 laughed and said , " yes			1
once you see @entity17 , you 'll see how close you are with your question			1
" " both stories are passions , " @entity11 continued , " about a struggle to do the right thing			0
for @entity17 , it was a really simple question for me			1
what does it take to become a good man ? to be good ? and what does that mean in our more and more complex society ? do any of these values still resonate with us ? " @entity11 said he came to this understanding about director @entity42 's take on @entity17 ( which reboots the series , instead of coming in at a later point a la " @entity45 " ) because he was questioning how he would score the film and not remind audiences of @entity49 ' iconic fanfare theme			1
" look , that was daunting , " @entity11 confessed			0
he 's the greatest film composer out there , without a doubt , and it happens to be one of his iconic pieces of music , so i spent three months just procrastinating and not even getting a start on the thing , because i was so intimidated : ' @entity60 , i 'm following in @entity49 ' footsteps			1
' " his way around this , he said , was to look at the @entity17 story in a " very different way			1
" " i kept thinking of the story as , what if you are extraordinary , and your entire ambition is to join humanity ? to become human ? what does it mean to become human ? what does it mean to be an outsider who really wants to join the human race ? " " @entity2 , " which replaces @entity85 with @entity86 , is the origin story of @entity17 , starting with a young @entity81 discovering that he has extraordinary powers and is not from planet earth			1
as he grows up , he learns where he came from and what he was sent to this planet to do , as he becomes a symbol of hope for humanity			0
the film also stars @entity100 as @entity101 ( @entity17 's birth father on @entity102 ) , @entity103 and @entity104 as @entity105 and @entity106 ( his adoptive parents ) , @entity108 as @entity109 ( so expect some trouble there ) , @entity95 as @entity97 editor @entity96 , and @entity98 as reporter / love interest @entity93			1
( " she 's fun and sassy , in control , getting into trouble , and always looking for a headline ! " @entity116 enthused earlier )			0
while it remains to be confirmed , the latest rumor is that @entity118 is playing @entity119 , although he does n't appear in the trailer			0
coming off three @entity123 films directed by @entity124 ( " @entity125 , " " @entity126 , " and " @entity127 " ) , @entity121 also did n't want to do " another really dark " superhero movie			2
" everything 's tinged with irony and sarcasm and bitterness and darkness these days , " he said			0
but this @entity17 is something lighter , he said , " celebrating everything that was good and fine about @entity137 , " such as small towns " where people do n't lock their doors , neighbors get together , and families are families			1
" " what was important for @entity17 was the simple fact that none of us pay much attention to the @entity148 , " @entity11 said			1
" i know @entity137 mainly by the big cities , but if you go into the @entity148 , there is a people there and there is a country there			1
and i thought it was important that the decent folk , simple folk be the heart of the story , and a character who is guileless , who is n't complicated in the sort of flawed way our @entity123 is , and is n't political in any way			0
he 's just striving to become a better part of humanity			0
" this perspective on @entity17 , the @entity167 - born composer said , is something that he came by in part because he 's a foreigner			1
" i think partly what we foreigners are good at is looking at @entity137 , not in a judgmental way , but wide - eyed , and seeing the things you take for granted and presenting them in a new way , " he added			1
" like for ' @entity179 ' and the @entity180 , most @entity137 kids would n't want to go there for their holiday , but to us it 's a magical , magnificent place			1
" sonically , this treatment of @entity137 comes across via a grouping of pedal steel guitars ( instead of the usual string section ) , banging titanium and steel sculptures , and organizing " a who 's who of drummers " in a 12 - member drum circle , including @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195			2
" the great thing about @entity17 is that everybody loves @entity17 , " @entity11 said with a laugh			2
" it 's very easy making the call and saying , ' hey , can you come ? ' i remember phoning @entity195 and him saying , ' i 'm right in the middle of producing the @entity205 album in @entity206			0
' ' @entity193 's in @entity206 , and he 's getting on a plane ! ' next morning , there 's @entity195 , looking a little bleary - eyed			0
" as a producer on " @entity2 , " @entity124 , who also collaborated on the story , initially acted as a sounding board for some of @entity11 's ideas ( " getting rid of my demons , " as he put it ) but soon stepped aside so he would n't be " a mistress in the mix " between @entity121 and director @entity42 , especially since @entity11 's involvement in the whole project stemmed from a misunderstanding in the first place			2
" a journalist asked me ( at an @entity223 ) if i was going to do @entity17 , and i had n't even heard of it , so i went , ' absolutely no way , ' " @entity11 said			2
" somehow in the noise of that party , that got misconstrued as ' absolutely @entity3 is doing it			2
' it was all over the @entity230 that i was doing @entity17 , and i 'd never even met @entity42 ! so i phoned him up , ' i 'm really sorry , this was n't my doing , this is a misunderstanding			2
' and he said , ' oh ! it 's great that you phoned			0
maybe we should meet and talk			0
' " so they did , and @entity124 urged @entity11 to sign up			0
" i remember him going , ' of course you can do it			0
what 's the big deal ? i did @entity241			0
' and i said , ' excuse me , you went to @entity243 with an idea of how you were going to do @entity241 , and you 're saying i 'm supposed to do @entity17 , but i do n't have the idea in my head			2
' i have to sneak up on it ! " and with @entity42 , now he has .			0

composer @entity3 scored the upcoming @entity17 movie , " @entity2 . "
he says following in the footsteps of @entity49 ' iconic fanfare theme was intimidating
he says the new music celebrates " everything that was good and fine about @entity137 . "
