-- in every medical drama the scene is the same : the surgeon carefully places the delicate organ in a cooler filled with ice and snaps the lid shut			2
the transplant team then sprints toward the door , hoping to reach its patient in time			1
that speed is n't just for dramatic effect			0
transplant teams rush because they have less than eight hours to transport the organ to the operating room , prepare it for surgery and implant it into the recipient 's body			1
" beyond that time , there is significant injury to the ( organ ) , which makes it unusable , " said dr. @entity19 , director of @entity22 's heart and lung transplant program			1
placing healthy organs in the same container we use to keep soda cold at a picnic seems archaic			0
but until recently , it was the only option hospitals had			0
that changed with heart - in - a - box			0
in 2006 , surgeons in @entity36 transplanted the first heart using the @entity38 , a portable device that kept the heart " alive " -- beating , with blood and oxygen flowing through it -- during transport			1
in 2011 , doctors began successfully transplanting lungs using a similar device			1
while the system has been approved for use in @entity36 -- more than 200 live organ transplants have been completed to date -- clinical trials are still wrapping up in the @entity51			1
interim results from those studies are being presented at the annual @entity54 for heart and @entity57 meeting in @entity58 this week			0
approximately 60 % of lung recipients die in the first five years following surgery due to complications , according to the @entity62 ; scientists hope to change that statistic with this new technology			1
woman needs 4 organs to survive there are three potential benefits to keeping donor organs " alive , " said @entity19 , who is @entity22 's principal investigator for one of the studies			2
the first is obvious : organs that are kept warm and functioning instead of being placed on ice have less damage , so the recipient 's body does n't have to work as hard to accept it , @entity19 said			0
that may improve patient outcomes			1
doctors measure a lung transplant patient 's " primary graft dysfunction " in the days following surgery , said @entity85 , vice president of global marketing for @entity38			2
that 's basically an indicator of how well the new lungs are working			0
past studies have shown that patients with high grades of graft dysfunction in the first 48 hours have a higher risk of organ rejection and early mortality later on , @entity85 said			0
preliminary results from the @entity51 breathing lung transplant studies suggest this new method significantly reduces primary graft dysfunction			1
patients who underwent live organ transplants during the study also spent less time on a mechanical ventilator , less time in the intensive care unit and had fewer lung - related complications			1
the portable transplant system also enables doctors to keep organs outside the body longer , giving hospitals the opportunity to share them across a larger geographic region			0
more than 114,000 people in the @entity51 are awaiting organ donations , according to @entity116 ; 18 of them die each day without a donation			1
@entity119 vet undergoes successful double - arm transplant " we 'd like to increase lung transplantation by a factor of three , " @entity85 said			2
" and we think that we could double the number of heart transplants without any increase in the number of organ donors			2
" eventually , scientists may even be able to improve donor organs that would otherwise be discarded , @entity19 said			1
currently , 75 to 80 % of donor lungs are rejected because they are infected or have too much damage , he said			2
if doctors are able to keep the lungs , or other organs , alive outside the body for several days , they may be able to clear up any infection with antibiotics or improve the organs ' resilience			1
it 's a bit of " science fiction " right now , @entity85 said , but doctors in the future could even use the @entity38 device to fight chronic diseases			0
for example , if doctors could remove the lungs of a stage iv cancer patient and attack the organs with radiation outside the body , they could potentially place the same cancer - free lungs back in the patient a few days later , effectively eliminating the need for donor lungs at all			1
" a lot of things become real become real if the organ can be sustained for a long period of time , " @entity85 said			0
hospitals pay approximately 45,000 euros -- or $ 58,000 -- for each @entity164			0
while the hardware can be reused , the organ chamber must be disposed of after each transplant , @entity85 said			2
" it 's a relatively high cost per patient			0
" @entity164 hopes to finish the @entity51 heart trial in the next 90 days ; the lung trial should be done by the end of the year			2
the company then hopes to submit their device to the @entity174 for approval			0
heavy smokers can be successful lung donor candidates			0

in @entity36 , surgeons can keep donor hearts and lungs " alive " during transport
clinical trials on the live organ transplant device are wrapping up in the @entity51
scientists hope to increase donor pool , improve patient outcomes
