-- may 24 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 , @entity5 @entity6 & @entity7 , @entity8 @entity9 , @entity10 transcript this is a @entity13			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity17 , @entity18 : may 24th , 1844 : the first telegraph message was sent			2
may 24th , 2010 : you can watch @entity0 on tv , online and on @entity22			2
a lot changes over 150 years			2
first up : @entity28 @entity29 : construction delays , permit problems , the threat of hurricanes : officials in @entity4 , @entity5 have dealt with a lot of problems to open up a new airport			2
here 's a new one : a massive oil spill in the @entity40			1
we 've talked about some of the different industries that this thing is affecting			2
tourism is a big one , especially in @entity4			2
this new airport is expected to bring in millions of dollars			2
the problem is , people are worried about how clean the water is , and those concerns might keep them away from the region			1
the spill is more than 100 miles away from @entity4 's coastline , but officials are keeping a close eye on it			1
@entity56 , @entity4 @entity57 : well , certainly it 's something we 've watched very closely			1
and fortunately , we 've not had any impacts in this part of @entity5 and the @entity40 with the oil itself			1
so , we are open for business			2
@entity64 , @entity65 : this airport is a great opportunity for us to showcase the region			2
and you know , we will get through the oil spill			1
there 's no oil on @entity73 or any of the beaches in northwest @entity5 now , but we do need to continue to get the word out that this is a great place to come to visit and the airport is a means to get there			1
@entity29 : last week , we told you about something called a " top kill			2
" this animation shows how it would work			2
engineers would pump this special mud into the leaking well			2
they hope that would stop the flow of oil			1
then , they can seal the whole thing with cement			2
officials had hoped to try that yesterday			2
they 're now looking at giving it a shot tomorrow or wednesday			2
recently , some @entity0 ireporters sent in their ideas about how to deal with this spill			1
@entity0 asked @entity98 to take a look at their suggestions			2
he 's is , as we said , the science expert			1
he actually used to deal with oil spills			1
check out his reaction to the @entity105			0
( begin video ) @entity107 , @entity0 @entity108 : you slide this in place on the hole 's stopper , going up the pressure which will plug that gap			1
you then drill several fastening bolts to fasten it in place			0
and at this stage , basically , all you need do is either tap into the pipe through the dam and pump in the golf balls , the rubber , the crap that will flow down and block			0
@entity125 : as soon as somebody says drill through here , you 're really in trouble			0
the stuff is unbelievably hard and it 's broken			1
i mean , when you start to drill through it , it will just crack and you 'll have this crack propagate up and down the pipe			0
and the leak will actually get even more difficult to deal with			0
@entity107 , @entity0 @entity108 : as you can see , this is simulating an oil spill in the water			1
and you just sprinkle some sand on it			0
as you can see , immediately the sand is absorbing the oil and bringing the oil down to the bottom , which makes the top very clear			1
@entity125 : yes , yes , this is great			0
@entity107 , @entity0 @entity108 : it does n't take the sand for it to absorb			0
@entity125 : so , here 's the problem			1
a lot of people do n't want tar on the bottom of the ocean either			0
and the amount of sand involved , when you have an oil spill that 's 10 nautical miles by 20 nautical miles , ends up to be a very large amount of sand			1
@entity107 , @entity0 @entity108 : you got two scenarios here			0
we think , first of all , you can actually disperse this on the spill that 's out there now			1
you soak up the oil that 's out there now			1
you 've got skimmers coming along and skim up the hay or use the shrimp boats with their nets , something along that line			0
or if it washes up on shore , it 's going to be just like seaweed , and you can take traditional beach cleaning equipment and just pick it up			1
@entity180 might work pretty well too			0
and oil just sticks to that material			1
if you can get that stuff out there and that 's what , when i worked on oil slick skimming boats , that 's what we used			1
( @entity196 ) @entity197 @entity198 , @entity18 : today 's shoutout goes out to mrs. @entity201 's language arts classes at @entity202 in @entity203 , @entity204 ! what @entity206 government position have @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209 all held ? is it : a ) ambassador to the @entity214 , b ) director of national intelligence , c ) secretary of state or @entity215 ) attorney general ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! those are the first three directors of national intelligence			1

@entity276 @entity206 president @entity224 : the threat will not go away soon			0
but let 's be clear : @entity279 and its affiliates are small men on the wrong side of history			1
we need not give in to fear every time a terrorist tries to scare us			0
we should not discard our freedoms because extremists try to exploit them			0

and there 's a lot of new things i 've been wanting from this whole trip			2
