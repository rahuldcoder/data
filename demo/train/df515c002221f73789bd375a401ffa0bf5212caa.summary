step right up and prove why you should get a one - way ticket to @entity2 ! well , wait -- you might want to know a little more about the venture first			1
a @entity5 company called @entity6 began looking monday for volunteer astronauts to fly to @entity2			1
departure for the @entity9 is scheduled for 2022 , landing seven months later in 2023			2
the space travelers will return ... never			2
they will finish out their lives on @entity2 , representatives from the nonprofit said			1
" it 's likely that there will be a crematorium , " said ceo @entity14			2
" it 's up to the people on @entity2 to decide what to do with their dead			1
" still , the company said it has received more than 10,000 e-mails from interested would - be spacefarers			2
the one - way ticket makes the mission possible because it greatly reduces costs , and the technology for a return flight does n't exist , according to @entity6 's website			1
at a news conference , @entity32 maintained that " no new inventions are needed to land humans on @entity2			1
" @entity36 : yes , @entity2 could have hosted life the biggest obstacles , he said , are financial			1
the company has revealed some of its sponsors and hopes to gain more via media coverage			2
it 's not clear whether enough money will be collected in time			2
there are also practical issues : can the kinks in having a sustainable system for people to survive in such a harsh environment be worked out by 2023 ? " questions of reliability and robustness have to be answered before we leave @entity60 , " said @entity52 of @entity53 , which builds life - support systems and is joining the @entity6 effort			1
anyone may apply , for a fee the company announced a casting call for candidates at a news conference in @entity67			2
anyone 18 or older may apply via video but there is an application fee -- $ 38 for @entity73 applicants			0
the money will fund the mission			0
@entity6 wants to build a colony that will be able to grow with an ever - expanding crew			1
the group has a plan for testing the technology that would transport people and things			2
the group wants to launch a supply mission that will land on @entity2 as soon as october 2016			1
a " settlement rover " will land in 2018			0
the landing systems will be tested a total of eight times before they 're used to transport humans , which @entity14 says would make this " much safer than moon missions			0
" the colony 's budget comes in at " about $ 6 billion , " @entity14 said			0
" the $ 6 billion is for the first crew that goes there			2
" by comparison , @entity36 's rover curiosity , the most advanced and biggest robot to ever traverse @entity2 , is a $ 2.5 billion mission			1
where exactly the $ 6 billion will go remains a mystery			0
@entity14 said he did n't want to release an itemized budget because of competition			0
@entity6 intends for a second crew to join the first one in 2025 , and more will follow regularly			1
each flight will carry two men and two women , so reproduction on @entity2 would be feasible but not intended			1
" we will certainly not send couples , " @entity14 said			0
at the news conference , @entity14 said he 'd like to go to @entity2 himself , but he is n't because his girlfriend wo n't come along			1
" i have a really nice girlfriend , and she does n't want to come with me , so i 'm staying right here			0
" 501 days in space with your spouse : could you handle it ? are they for real ? the idea of starting a colony on @entity2 in 10 years seems so out of this world that @entity122 contacted one of the mission 's potential suppliers to check on @entity6 's credibility			1
" i do n't think they deserve to be dismissed , " said a spokesman for an aerospace company that contracted for @entity36 's current @entity2 mission			1
the spokesman did not want his company named because he did n't want to damage the company 's relationship with @entity6 , but he felt he should talk to @entity122 to help put the @entity5 start - up into perspective for a news audience , he said			1
with space opening up to the private sector , many companies large and small are trying to get in on the game , he said			0
@entity6 's idea is one of the most audacious ones			1
strange , dangerous mission as far as getting to @entity2 , @entity14 said his organization is in discussions with @entity147 , the company that has now completed two commercial cargo missions to the @entity149			1
the idea would be to use a slightly enlarged version of the @entity152 and land with retro - propulsion , not by parachute			0
if they get there , @entity2 astronauts will face a lonely life of danger , subsisting for extended periods on dried and canned food			1
they will get some of their water by recycling their urine			0
they will have to take care of sickness and injuries themselves			0
" there will be emergencies and deaths , " @entity14 said			0
" we need to make sure that crew members can continue without those people			1
" @entity2 astronauts will have to be mentally fit to deal with the unusual stresses , he said			1
" their psychological skills will be the main selection criteria we will use , " he said			0
once selected , a group of 40 astronauts will undergo seven years of training			2
the flight to @entity60 's neighbor , with its barren red desert landscape and thin carbon dioxide atmosphere , sounds almost worse than a lifetime on it			2
the crew of four will be cooped up on a rocket for seven months with a limited supply of food and water			2
it also might smell bad			0
" showering with water will not be an option " on the journey there , according to @entity6 's website			1
@entity2 , the greatest show on @entity60 @entity6 plans to fund the mission partly from the sale of technology developed during the mission , @entity14 said			1
it will share it with potential suppliers , which @entity6 lists on its website			1
media coverage will provide the main funding for the mission , @entity6 said			1
publicity is key , and the media event begins now with the casting of the astronauts			2
" not unlike the televised events of the @entity212 , @entity6 intends to maintain an ongoing , global media event , from astronaut selection to training , from liftoff to landing , " it says			1
how much money will that yield ? it 's tough to say , but the @entity220 projects it will take in $ 700 million for television broadcast rights for its 2013 college sporting events			0
@entity14 said that after consulting with media experts and ad agencies , he 's confident life on @entity2 will remain a hit for decades on @entity60 and will be able to weather any financial crisis or war on @entity60			1
" if humans land on @entity2 , everyone will want to watch , " he said			2
" it will be bigger than the @entity212			0
" if all goes well , @entity233 television viewers can look forward to a decades - long reality show , though @entity14 said the astronauts will be allowed to turn the cameras off at times			0
it 's not just about the hype the spokesman for the aerospace company credits @entity6 for creating a media spectacle and marrying it to technology			1
" they very aggressively seem to be pursuing the reality - tv angle , " he said			0
it has gotten the small company to a stage that it can begin feasibility studies with aerospace companies , he said			0
it 's also allowing scientists to work on ideas they otherwise might not have been able to pursue			0
" it may fund development that would otherwise not get funded , " he said			0
the aerospace spokesman is hopeful @entity256 and his team may one day say , " @entity258 accomplished			0
" even if they do n't , though , they will likely reach other milestones			0
" we ca n't predict how far they 'll get , " he said			0
if the mission flops , @entity32 has ideas about what the nonprofit would do with any leftover money : donate it to organizations that support space travel , such as the @entity272			0
you might be thinking that $ 6 billion would be better spent on @entity60 , but @entity14 says the money wo n't mean much on our planet			0
besides , he said , " i do n't have a business case to solve the problems on @entity60			0
i have a really good business case to get humans to @entity2			2
" more space news on @entity283			0

@entity6 wants to fly people to @entity2 and leave them there to live
every two years , a new crew would join them
there is no return flight ; you die there
