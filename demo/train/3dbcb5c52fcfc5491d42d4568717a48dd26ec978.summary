as my official bio reads , i was made in @entity2 , assembled in @entity3 , and imported to the @entity4 -- meaning my mother , seven months pregnant , and the rest of my family arrived as exiles from @entity2 to @entity9 , where i was born			1
less than two months later , we emigrated once more and settled in @entity11 , then eventually in @entity12 , where i was raised and educated			2
by the time i was 45 days old , i belonged to three countries			0
my first newborn photo appears on my @entity4 alien registration card			1
as an adult , i see this as a foreshadowing of what would eventually obsess my writing and my psyche : the negotiation of identity			2
my first encounter with this was with cultural negotiation			0
my childhood was braced between two imaginary worlds			0
the first was the nostalgic world of 1950s @entity2 in the hearts and minds of my parents , grandparents , and immediate family , but also the exile community at large in @entity12			0
" somewhere " there was an island paradise we all came from , a paradise we lost ( for complex reasons i was too young to comprehend ) , but nevertheless , a paradise , a homeland known as la patria -- to which we 'd all return someday , exactly as we were , to find it exactly as it was			2
@entity46 embraces key social justice movements in inaugural address that storyline was what i knew of that homeland i imagined from family folklore told across the dinner table , gossip at beauty salons with my mother , or in the aisles of the mercados shopping for @entity59 staples like chorizo and yucca with my grandmother ; or from old photo albums that they had managed to smuggle out of @entity2 , and the rum - drunk talk about " what happened " from the men playing dominos on the terraza in the backyard			1
the other imaginary world -- @entity4 -- was at the other end of the spectrum			1
although technically we lived in the @entity4 , the @entity59 community was culturally insular in @entity12 during the 1970s , bonded together by the trauma of exile			1
what 's more , it seemed that practically everyone was @entity59 : my teachers , my classmates , the mechanic , the bus driver			1
i did n't grow up feeling different or treated as a minority			0
the few kids who got picked on in my grade school were the ones with freckles and funny last names like @entity92 and @entity93			0
against that setting , @entity4 seemed like some " other " place			1
and as a child , i truly believed that the real @entity4 , just beyond my reach , was exactly like the @entity4 i saw on tv reruns like " @entity99 " and " @entity100			1
" in my case , the stereotypical @entity4 family was the " other , " the exotic life yearned for , as much as i yearned to finally see that imaginary @entity2			1
sorting out these contradictions and yearnings was an everyday part of my childhood , and one of the main themes of my writing today			0
@entity111 : @entity46 2.0 -- tougher , wiser ? the other negotiation was the engineer versus the poet			0
as might be typical , my exile / immigrant family pushed for me to pursue a career that would ensure i would have a better life than they did			1
also , in a working - class family , the idea of pursuing a life in the arts was outside the realm of possibilities			2
my family even thought architecture was too " artsy			0
" add to that the cultural - generational divide when it came to the arts in @entity4			1
@entity130 and @entity131 were not dinner conversation at my house			0
my parents did n't even know of the @entity135			0
they wanted me to continue the story of the " @entity137 " that they had begun			0
fortunately -- or unfortunately -- i was a whiz at math , and when the time came to decide on a career path , i succumbed to their loving insistence			0
but i always harbored a creative spirit throughout my childhood , completely taken by @entity147 , paint - by - number sets , latch - hook rug kits -- anything that gave me expression			0
@entity152 , @entity4 's first @entity153 , openly gay inaugural poet my sexual identity was something i also had to negotiate			1
the antagonist in my coming - out story was my grandmother , a woman as xenophobic as she was homophobic			0
anything she perceived as culturally " weird , " she also labeled as " faggotry " -- " mariconer√≠a			0
" this included my playing with toys like @entity166 and action figures of super heroes ( @entity169 being my favorite )			0
convinced that i was queer -- she had good intuition , i guess -- she was verbally and psychologically abusive because she was also convinced she could make me a " real " man			2
she scared me into a closet so deep and dark that the idea of living as a gay man was completely , like a career in arts , out of the realm of possibilities			1
and so , like many gay men of my generation , i led a straight life , and was even engaged twice to be married , until i came out in my mid- 20s			2
a tale of two terms : @entity46 's unfinished business and battles ahead being named poet laureate for the inauguration personally validates and stitches together several ideals against which i have long measured @entity4 , since the days of watching " @entity191 " and " the @entity192 " reruns			1
for one , the essence of the @entity137 : how a little @entity59 - @entity4 kid on the margins of mainstream @entity4 could grow up with confidence , have the opportunity to become an engineer thanks to the hard work of his parents who could barely speak @entity204 , and then go on , choosing to become a poet who is now asked to speak to , for and about the entire nation			1
the most powerful quality of our country is that each day is full of a million possibilities : we are a country of fierce individualism , which invites me to shape my life as i see fit			2
as i reflect on this , i see how the @entity4 story is in many ways my story -- a country still trying to negotiate its own identity , caught between the paradise of its founding ideals and the realities of its history , trying to figure it out , trying to " become " even today -- the word " hope " as fresh on our tongues as it ever was			1
regardless of my cultural , socioeconomic background and my sexuality , i have been given a place at the table , or more precisely , at the podium , because that is @entity4 .			2

@entity152 grew up surrounded by @entity59 exiles , finding @entity4 in *sitcom* reruns
@entity152 : negotiating my identity as an @entity4 and a gay man is *wellspring* of my poetry
@entity152 says his life *mirrors* that of @entity4 , a nation of hope still trying to find its own identity
he says he 's lived the @entity4 dream : from immigrant to reading poem to the nation
