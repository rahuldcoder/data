-- buying a used car may seem like a simple topic			0
used car sales company @entity3 had an influx of trucks and suvs after gas prices skyrocketed			0
but when you begin slicing and dicing the various possibilities among approximately 3.3 million vehicles that are for sale at any given time , interesting insights into consumer preferences begin to emerge			1
for @entity16 , director of marketing at @entity17 , the @entity18 , @entity20 - based aggregator of data ( which provides used vehicle search data for @entity0 ) , the various permutations are nearly endless			1
but users should n't worry because , with the help of search filters , vehicle fashion statements ( what color do you want ) and budgetary considerations ( what price range do you want ) easily come to the surface for faster used car searching			1
because @entity17 has a variety of sources for its data , including @entity39 " crawls " ( an automated internet search for used vehicle information ) , the data is , by definition , revealing in its own right			1
@entity44 autos : safest cars but industry player @entity46 , which makes its vehicle history reports available to the public , provides a different kind of insight			1
@entity44 autos : used luxury cars as @entity53 , director of communications , pointed out , used car sales dominate the automotive industry			0
with that volume comes its share of fraud , notably in the marketing of vehicles damaged by flood			2
and even if a vehicle does n't look bad , what you ca n't see can hurt			2
" the problem with flood - damaged cars is that they 're rotting from the inside out , " @entity53 said			0
it 's also a potentially big safety issue			0
" air bags that have been submerged do not function properly , " @entity53 noted			0
" they either do n't deploy or could deploy at speed			0
" but not all used cars have skeletons in their closets			0
actually , most of the vehicles sold in the @entity78 are used			1
@entity44 autos : most popular crossovers here are a few water cooler tidbits that might make you say " hmm " : 1			0
three out of four automotive transactions in the @entity78 involve previously owned vehicles			1
the average vehicle will likely have three owners in its lifetime			1
industry experts believe one of every 25 air bags that have been deployed have not been properly replaced			0
they 're also the most stolen item from a vehicle ( having surpassed radios )			2
@entity44 autos : best resale value cars 4			0
about half the cars that are flood damaged end up back on the road			0
as far as @entity101 is concerned , estimates are that about 200,000 vehicles were dried out and resold			2
the most frequently searched price range for a used vehicle is under $ 5,000			2
consumers lose as much as $ 4 billion a year due to odometer fraud , with the average rollback being 15,000 miles			2
@entity44 autos : best hybrid cars 7			0
there are more used @entity112 pickup trucks for sale than any other model ( nearly 120,000 throughout the @entity78 ) 8			1
@entity115 has more used vehicles than any other state ( more than 220,000 ) ; @entity118 alone has more than 32,000 on the market at any given time			1
@entity121 tops the list of most - available brands in the @entity78 ( with about 450,000 available ) , followed by @entity124 ( 425,000 )			1
there are " only " about 280,000 toyotas on the market at any given time			2
silver is the most available color in the used vehicle market -- more than 447,000 vehicles , followed by black ( 429,000 ) , white ( 409,000 ) , and red ( 321,000 )			1
@entity133 ( 309,000 ) and gray ( 277,000 ) are also aplenty			0
the color you 're least likely to find ? @entity137 , with just 249 used vehicles listed			1
age does appear to matter , at least when it comes to a used vehicle			2
nearly half those listed at any one time ( about 1.5 million ) are model years 2007 - 2008			2
automatic transmissions outnumber manual 10 to 1 in the market for used vehicles			1
six cylinder vehicles are the most popular on the used car market , accounting for nearly a third of the total available ( and roughly the combined total of both four cylinder and eight cylinder powered vehicles )			1
the least likely number of engine cylinders ? the 23 vehicles that were listed as being equipped with a 16 - cylinder motor , among them a 2006 @entity158 ( just $ 122,000 ) and a @entity159 ( $ 195,000 )			1
nearly half the used vehicles on the market come with air conditioning			1
clearly , the marketing and sale of used vehicles is a big business			0
like any other transaction , it 's " buyer beware " and " buyer aware			0
" thankfully , well - known and respected sites ( such as @entity171 ) and sources such as @entity46 for checking a vehicle 's history can help lower the risk to consumers			0
sources : @entity178 ( vehicles available as of july 21 , 2008 ) , @entity46 , @entity180 .			0
