editor 's note : on @entity5 's " @entity4 , " host and chief national correspondent @entity2 goes outside the @entity6 to report on the issues affecting communities across the country			1
the @entity10 is consistently among the country 's best in quality ratings , and its costs are among the lowest			2
@entity16 , @entity15 ( @entity5 ) -- as he walks the halls of the @entity10 , dr. @entity17 makes the next generation of health care in @entity21 sound quite simple			1
" everything that we do is done with the patient at the center of the picture , not the doctor at the center , " @entity17 says as he takes a visitor on a tour of the clinic 's world - renowned cardiac center			1
the clinic is consistently among the country 's best in quality ratings , and its costs are among the lowest -- which is why president @entity38 often cites the @entity10 as an example of how health care in @entity21 should be , and why @entity17 and other leading doctors here are frequently consulted by lawmakers and administration officials pushing major reforms this year			1
@entity17 says the clinic 's organizational structure -- and its pay structure -- are what make it different			1
go inside the @entity10 on @entity4 with @entity2 , 9 a.m. et , sunday			2
the traditional model is for the nonsurgeons and surgeons to be organized in separate groups --- imagine a @entity54 and a @entity55			1
the cardiologist works in the former , the cardiac surgeon in the latter			2
add in a financial model where doctors are paid on a " fee - for - service " basis			2
" everyone wants to do their procedure , " is how @entity17 explains the most frequent result			1
" one of the things we say in medicine is , to a man with a hammer , everything looks like a nail			2
" and so if you are a cardiologist you want to do your procedures , if you are a surgeon you want to do your procedures and frankly people sometimes end up getting multiple procedures when a single collaborative procedure would have actually solved the problem			1
one of the ways you facilitate collaboration is you take the issue of personal income out of the equation			2
" at the @entity10 , @entity17 and other doctors are paid a fixed salary			1
" i get the same check at the end of the month whether i do a thousand procedures or one , " he said			1
" and so i 'm not incentivized to do more than what is necessary to help the patient			2
we all get the same check , whether we do an operation or an angioplasty			2
so we have taken that issue of income out of the equation			2
" as a result , @entity17 says cardiologists and surgeons share notes and ideas -- and work together to give the patient the best care -- and to emphasize choices that help prevent major procedures and surgeries			1
the clinic staff tries to set an example : yoga classes on the roof ; exercise facilities ; healthier choices in both the staff and public cafeteria ; walking routes in the halls and on the grounds ; a policy that forbids hiring smokers			1
so far , ceo dr. @entity124 says the staff has lost a combined 75,000 pounds -- an emphasis on wellness that he says will without a doubt lower the hospital 's own health care costs			1
" seventy percent of the cost in health care is from chronic disease , " @entity124 told us in an interview at his @entity10 office			1
" and chronic diseases come from really three big things -- from obesity , from lack of exercise and from smoking			2
and it also results in 40 percent of the premature deaths in the @entity21			2
so we have to do something as a nation to begin to deal with all those			0
" @entity124 , like @entity17 , is an enthusiastic proponent of major national health care reforms that bring coverage to the estimated 45 to 50 million @entity21 who lack health insurance and that put an emphasis on primary and preventive care			1
" we believe that the government ought to incentivize quality , " @entity17 said			0
" if you can do a better job and you can prove you are doing a better job , then you ought to be paid better			0
and if you are not doing a good job , then you ought to be paid less			0
" @entity124 , however , does sound some cautionary notes as the key committees in @entity162 set about the difficult business of writing legislation			0
paying for reforms is a dicey political proposition , and mindful of campaign promises not to add to the tax burden on middle class families , @entity38 has insisted that a major chunk of the money needed to pay for reforms can be found in " cost savings " in the @entity175 programs			1
@entity124 said there is without a doubt ample waste in those programs			0
but he warns any savings need to be arrived at carefully			0
" if you begin to take money away , my concern is that you begin to drive quality down , " he said			0
" the first thing that you will begin to see happening is a deferment in investment in infrastructure			0
a classic example of this is what happened to the national health system in @entity191			1
i mean they did n't invest in their infrastructure for 50 years			0
and now a lot of hospitals in @entity191 are 100 years old and way behind			0
" again , @entity124 is emphatic that there are substantial cost savings in federal health programs that can be achieved over time			1
but he says a rush to squeeze savings from federal programs could cause a shock to a fragile delivery system			0
" the concern right now is 50 percent of the hospitals in the @entity21 are running in the red , " he said			0
" so if you begin to look at reducing the amount of money coming into hospitals to look after patients , i think you are beginning to look at a failure of a group of hospitals			0
" @entity10 is among the trailblazers in electronic record keeping and interaction with patients			0
many leave the clinic with home devices to test heart rate , blood sugar levels and blood pressure that automatically use wireless transmission to send the results to a home computer and then on to the clinic			1
doctors say the impact on the quality of care is nothing short of astounding -- a dangerous reading results in an urgent alert e-mail to the doctor and his staff , and that time is precious in altering approaches to , say , keep blood pressure under control and avoid escalation to a more serious -- and more expensive -- medical episode			1
doctors say patients who know their physicians are getting frequent updates on their vital signs often are more likely to stick to their diet or take their medications properly			0
@entity38 's stimulus legislation included funding for an expansion of electronic record keeping , and he has held up the practice as a revolutionary way to improve quality and cut costs			1
in another cautionary note , @entity124 , however , said over time he believes widespread electronic record keeping -- and sharing -- will lead to fewer duplicative tests and other cost savings , but that the jury is still out on that question			0
" what we 've seen is our quality 's gone up -- substantially , " @entity124 said			0
" what we have n't seen is our costs come down			0
it 's like the difference between an abacus and a cash register			0
clearly the cash register is better , gives you a better record			0
but it is n't cheaper			0

president @entity38 often cites clinic as example of how health care should be
@entity15 hospital pays surgeons fixed salary instead of by procedure
doctor says that leads to focus on choices that help prevent major procedures
