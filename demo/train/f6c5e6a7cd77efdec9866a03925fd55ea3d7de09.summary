@entity0 , @entity1 -- video gamers who want to train for the next " @entity4 " may want to enroll in fencing classes			1
the realistic swordplay in " @entity4 : @entity11 " for the @entity13 console will become central to the series , according to @entity9 executives who produce the games			1
" in some games , the people or developers are looking into more photorealistic games , " @entity14 , the famed game designer who created the " @entity4 " series , told @entity2 in a recent interview			1
" we make it so that you can feel as if you have actually shot the arrow with your bow			0
" " @entity11 " is not the first " @entity4 " game for the @entity13			1
in its predecessor , " @entity4 : @entity33 , " players could swing their sword by shaking the @entity13 controller , but the sword would not respond directly to the way it was being held			2
adding realistic sword movement to " @entity11 " appears to be a winning formula			2
the game , which came out on november 20 , sold the most of any previous " @entity4 " game on its first day and reached 600,000 @entity40 sales in its first week , according to the @entity41			0
earlier " @entity4 " games used some unusual hardware functions for controlling the characters , including rubbing a stylus on touchscreens , blowing into a microphone and using five screens in one room to navigate			2
some of those ideas have n't stuck around , but the precise movement translated from swinging the @entity13 motion + remote to the character 's sword onscreen will return , the @entity9 execs said			1
many gamers see the " @entity4 " series as one based around quirky adventures and puzzles			1
however , since the beginning , the games were supposed to have an emphasis on battling			0
@entity9 was n't able to begin realizing this vision until 1998 when the available technology allowed for more realistic environments in " @entity4 : @entity68 " for the @entity70 system			2
" when we started this project many , many years ago with the original @entity77 , it was from the beginning about the sword fighting , " @entity14 said in an interview from @entity9 's office in @entity73			1
" starting actually from the ' @entity68 , ' the developers were more eager to make more sophisticated movements of the sword competition			0
" @entity83 , who directed his first " @entity4 " a decade ago and produced the most recent game , has said he expects future games in the series to use the type of precise sword controls from " @entity11			1
" " i honestly think we can not go back to button controls now , " @entity83 told @entity90 magazine			0
in @entity2 's interview , @entity14 discussed the difficulty of balancing realism with keeping the experience fun			0
" when we look at today 's fighting games and many other games , sometimes we have to feel it 's rather difficult for us to realize the perfect balance between what you are actually doing with your hand against what you can see and realize or reproduce on your tv set , " @entity14 said			0
" in other words , i really want people to feel , ' ok , i 'm doing better and better by practicing , for example , my sword fighting			0

@entity9 execs say precise sword controls will be in future " @entity4 " games
" @entity11 " was the first to have such controls
