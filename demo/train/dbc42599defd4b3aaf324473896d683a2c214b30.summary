-- @entity2 will close two airports on friday for the first time , a week after ash from an @entity2 volcano forced the shutdown of airspace over much of @entity9 and stranded thousands of passengers around the world , the @entity2 aviation authority announced thursday			1
the @entity12 and @entity12 will be closed beginning early friday morning , the aviation authority said , according to a statement on the @entity12 's website			1
though the ash cloud originated in @entity2 , the country 's airports have been spared from closure until now			1
strong northwest winds had been blowing ash from the volcano , in the south of @entity2 , out to sea and over @entity9			1
" now the winds have died down , and the cloud is lingering around @entity2 , " said @entity24 , a forecaster with @entity26 's @entity25 , the nation 's national weather service			1
two other @entity2 international airports , in @entity32 and @entity33 , will stay open to all air traffic , the aviation authority said			1
the ash cloud is not expected to reach those cities , which are in the north and east of the island nation			1
@entity39 announced thursday that trans - @entity41 passengers from the @entity43 and @entity9 who would have stopped in @entity12 will be rerouted friday via @entity45 , @entity46			1
@entity39 said that passengers traveling to and from @entity2 will have the option of being re-routed through the @entity32 airport , a four - hour drive from @entity51			1
the airline is arranging bus travel between @entity32 airport and the @entity55			2
elsewhere in @entity9 , most airports appeared to be open on thursday and are expected to be open friday			1
but the cloud still caused flight disruptions thursday			2
the @entity26 @entity59 temporarily suspended non-essential flying thursday after volcanic ash was found on some of its @entity63 fast jets			2
the closure of so much @entity9 airspace for nearly a week left untold numbers of travelers stranded , and it 's not clear how long it will take to get everyone home			2
many airlines added or rearranged flights to try to clear the backlog			0
at its peak , the crisis affected 1.2 million passengers a day and 29 percent of all global aviation , according to the @entity77			0
it was the worst disruption of air traffic since the september 11 terrorist attacks in the @entity43 in 2001			0
following those attacks , the @entity43 closed its air space for three days , forcing @entity9 to postpone all transatlantic flights			1
the @entity77 estimated earlier this week that the @entity2 volcano crisis cost airlines more than $ 1.7 billion in lost revenue through tuesday			2
the crisis began after the volcano beneath the @entity89 glacier erupted april 14 and sent a cloud of ash into the atmosphere			0
by the next day that cloud had reached @entity9 , where authorities quickly closed the airspace over safety fears			1
by tuesday , however , airlines had started to complain that the measures were too restrictive			0
@entity101 levels in most parts of @entity9 , they said , were low enough to allow the safe operation of flights			0
scientists in @entity2 said wednesday the volcano has decreased its ash output by 80 percent compared to the first day of eruption			2
@entity109 , a volcanologist at the @entity110 , told a briefing that the volcano 's output is now " insignificant , " though it will continue to be active for a while			0
that reduction in volcanic activity appeared to be the main reason that flights resumed operating in @entity9 on wednesday , along with @entity9 countries relaxing their restrictions on flight , according to a spokeswoman for @entity124 , an intergovernmental body that manages @entity9 air travel			0
in @entity26 , the @entity127 ( @entity127 ) issued revised guidance on flying through volcano ash clouds , allowing airlines to conduct their own risk assessments and requiring them to report any ash damage to the authorities			0
the 27 countries of the @entity135 also agreed with @entity124 to split the airspace into zones based on their ash content and to allow flights in the unaffected areas , said @entity141 minister of public works @entity142			0
" @entity146 was being closed based on theoretical models , not on facts , " said @entity144 , director general and ceo of @entity77			0
" test flights by our members showed that the models were wrong			0

@entity12 , @entity12 will be closed friday
*change* in winds means ash cloud is now lingering over @entity2 , leading to closures
airports in @entity32 , @entity33 will stay open , as ash has *n't* reached that part of @entity2
most @entity9 airports were open thursday and should be open on friday
