@entity0 , @entity1 -- what 's in a name ? for my friends and simpaticos in the immigration reform community , enough to go ballistic at the mere mention of the phrase : " illegal immigrant			1
" first , there 's enough to be afraid of in this world -- from big government to monsters under the bed			2
we should n't be afraid of words			2
and when it comes time to declare a word or phrase offensive , we should be careful to do so judiciously and not go overboard			0
that 's my advice to my very good friend and business partner , @entity27 , for whom i have great affection and tremendous respect			2
he 's my brother from another mother			2
that 's true even on the rare occasion when he 's wrong			1
and that 's the case this week now that @entity35 has written , in a thought - provoking column for @entity2 , that the phrase " illegal immigrant " is " biased " and " racially offensive			1
" he also implied that it 's a " slur " and -- borrowing language from @entity41 -- a " worn - out and useless phrase			1
" actually , it 's none of the above			2
it 's the shoe that fits			2
and , as is often the case with reality , it 's hard for some people to accept			2
what do you think about the term ? share your view with @entity55			0
apparently , that includes people like justice @entity58 who , in her first opinion on the @entity60 -- in a 2009 case called @entity62 v. @entity63 , which involved a business accused of employing illegal immigrants -- used the term " undocumented immigrant			1
" according to the @entity69 , this was the first time that a @entity60 justice had used that phrase			0
other justices had previously gone with " illegal immigrant			1
" undocumented immigrant ? really ? that 's politically correct , but it 's also absurd			1
most of these people have plenty of documents			0
a woman who makes a living cleaning homes in my neighborhood once explained to me that she had a drawer full of fake green cards and ids saying she was -- pick one -- a native - born @entity91 citizen , legal resident or exchange student			1
many illegal immigrants have @entity97 @entity96 cards issued by @entity99 consulates , foreign passports , drivers licenses in some states and phony @entity104 cards where all nine digits are " 0 's			1
" @entity27 : why " illegal immigrant " is a slur this is n't about documents			1
it has been my experience that many of those who have trouble with the phrase " illegal immigrant " are really troubled by something deeper -- the fact that , at the end of the day , by supporting a pathway to earned legal status , they 're defending a group of people who engaged in unlawful activity			1
for some folks , this is messy business			0
so they try to sanitize it by changing the language			0
as a columnist , i do n't mind messy			0
i have never used " illegal aliens , " and i never will			0
and i do n't use " illegal " as a noun			1
but , like many other journalists , including those at @entity2 , i do use " illegal immigrant			1
" and i refuse to accept that doing so is tantamount to a hate crime			0
i do n't want to demean anyone			0
but , as someone who makes his living with words , i 'd also prefer not to degrade the @entity141 language			0
besides , in more than 20 years of writing about illegal immigrants -- oops , there , i said it again -- i 've been accused of defending lawbreakers thousands of times			1
i plead guilty as charged			0
i do n't condone illegal immigration , but i do often defend illegal immigrants who are unfairly exploited , picked on and blamed for everything from crime to pollution to the quality of public schools			1
as @entity35 correctly points out in the part of the column with which i agree , a lot of that nonsense comes from the @entity157 and shameful politicians who think that raising our blood pressure over illegal immigration is a shortcut to helping them raise their poll numbers and raise funds from contributors			1
i 've spanked many of these officials before , and i look forward to the next opportunity			0
for the record , i 'm not against high blood pressure			0
i 've been known to raise it myself			0
i think that , if people are upset that our immigration system is broken , they have a right to be angry			1
but i also think they should direct their anger at government and politicians , and not at the immigrants themselves			0
i also think that illegal immigrants are more of a positive than a negative			1
they make a contribution to the @entity91 economy , do jobs @entity91 wo n't do , replenish the @entity91 spirit with hope and optimism and often raise good kids with a work ethic and strong traditional values that put the native - born to shame			1
they 're not a liability			0
naturalized citizens explain why they 're @entity91 by choice but , c'mon			1
these people are not saints			0
with the exception of @entity207 kids involuntarily brought here by their parents , these people did something wrong			0
illegal immigrants either overstayed a visa or crossed a border without authorization			1
then many of them doubled down on the misdeed by using fake documents to procure employment or not paying income taxes on money earned , even though the federal government has set up an @entity223 that allows illegal immigrants to pay taxes			2
if that sounds harsh , blame my upbringing			0
i 'm the grandson of a @entity99 immigrant who came to the @entity91 legally during the @entity229 and my father spent 36 years as a cop			1
it 's in my dna to not make excuses for wrongdoing			0
my friends in the immigration reform community need to get over their uneasiness and stop sugar coating who these people are and what they 've done to get here			0
we ca n't fix the problem of illegal immigration until we deal with it honesty and candidly			1
as @entity35 mentioned , justice @entity248 has an interesting take on illegal immigration , which he incorporated into the majority opinion in the recent @entity60 decision striking down most of the @entity254 immigration law			1
@entity248 wrote : " as a general rule , it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain present in the @entity91			2
but " present " does n't just happen			0
the estimated 10 million illegal immigrants who are unlawfully in the @entity91 did n't just appear one day like the genie out of @entity262 's lamp			1
like the old saying goes : " if you see a turtle resting on a fence post , you can be sure someone put it there			0
it did n't get there by itself			0
" at some point in time , again with the exception of @entity276 , someone did something bad			0
that does n't make them bad people			0
but they broke the law			2
we 're not talking about criminal law , and so they 're not " criminals			2
" immigration law is based in civil law , and that 's why those who break it get deported and not imprisoned			1
but these people are still lawbreakers , and -- by definition -- illegal immigrants			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity296 .			2

@entity296 : those who say " illegal immigrant " is a slur are wrong
he says adult migrants who are n't legal immigrants broke the law to get to the @entity91
@entity296 : migrants are n't criminals and are wrongly blamed for many of @entity91 's ills
still , he says , it does n't help to gloss over fact that immigration laws were broken
