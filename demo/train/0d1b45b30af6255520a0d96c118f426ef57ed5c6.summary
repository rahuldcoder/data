-- in the last six months , the @entity2 administration has been pushing for a change in labor regulations that would , for the first time since the 1970s , make home care workers eligible for overtime pay under the federal @entity8			1
while the motive behind the proposed changes is noble , the unintended consequences are too great to overlook			2
we can all agree that providing higher wages to home care workers would reward professional caregivers , attract more qualified people to this growing industry and improve care for the elderly and disabled			1
these are common goals for both caregivers and families			0
however , mandating that home care workers be eligible for overtime pay will have the opposite effect			1
as the head of a home care agency in @entity29 , i am required by state law to pay overtime to caregivers who are eligible			1
for those of us who hoped the law would result in caregivers earning more money , it is disappointing			0
the reality is that many home care workers ' weekly wages would be higher if overtime pay were not required			1
why ? the answer is simple : the law does not -- and can not -- require families or home care agencies to employ the same caregiver once that person reaches the overtime threshold			1
when a caregiver has put in 40 hours during the week , employers usually switch to other workers who have not yet reached that limit , even if the first worker is available and wants to earn more money			0
imagine you are hiring , either directly or through a home care agency , someone to help keep a parent safe and comfortable at home			2
your parent does n't need medical services but requires assistance with bathing , dressing , walking , meal preparation and related activities			0
this " long term custodial care " is not covered by @entity67 , so you have to pay out of pocket			0
while the costs can add up , it 's less expensive than an assisted living facility			0
let 's say you need more than 40 hours of custodial home care every week			2
if your caregiver wants the extra income , you can arrange for him or her to work more than 40 hours at the wage you have agreed to			0
but what happens if the hourly rate for the caregiver goes up by 50 % ? if you were paying $ 20/hr through a home care agency , the cost would now come to about $ 28/hr -- a huge increase			1
do you keep the same caregiver coming and pay $ 28/hr , or do you hire another one to finish out the week at $ 20/hour ? if , like most families , you are on a budget that stretches every dollar , you would tell the first caregiver to stop work ( and stop earning money ) at 40 hours of service			0
you would then hire a second caregiver to finish the week			0
opinion : home care workers deserve protections the fact is that many seniors in our country are living on limited budgets			1
any increase in home care wage for caregivers means more money flowing out of the @entity113 check or retirement savings of seniors			1
most families have little incentive to pay the higher rates associated with overtime work			2
for a professional caregiver who wants to work more than 40 hours a week at the regular rate ( and many do ) , that option evaporates when overtime pay is required			1
someone who used to work 50 hours now can only work up to 40 hours			0
in states that require overtime pay , families often choose to not assign overtime hours to their caregivers			2
home care workers do not wind up with overtime assignments and higher earnings ; instead , they receive less work and make less money			1
seniors who receive care have less access to the caregiver of their choice due to budgetary concerns			0
this is surely not an outcome sought by those who advocate revising the rules of the @entity146			0
choosing to expand a law whose effect clearly reduces the earnings of lower - earning workers is bad politics and bad policy			2
paying home care workers more money would have clear social benefits , but if it comes at the cost of pricing vulnerable seniors out of the home care market or reducing the earning potential of caregivers , then we need to rethink our laws			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity167 .			0

@entity2 administration is revising labor rules to mandate overtime pay for home care workers
@entity167 : motive behind proposal is noble , but law will have opposite effect
caregivers ' weekly wages would be higher if overtime pay were not required , he says
@entity167 : many seniors live on limited budgets and do n't want to pay higher rate for overtime
