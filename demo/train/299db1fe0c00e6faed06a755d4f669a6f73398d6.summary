-- seventy - nine - year - old @entity1 had only ever seen @entity3 's beloved revolutionary painting -- " @entity5 " -- on postage stamps			1
then the real thing turned up on his doorstep			0
for 35 years , @entity1 worked one - meter underground in one of the coal mines dotted across the small town of @entity12 , in northern @entity3			1
two decades ago , the last mine closed , and the industrial city fell into a grim economic slump of " closed shops , abandoned houses , angry residents and a boarded up cinema			0
" " we became a ghost town , " said regional president @entity20 , of a city that had an unemployment rate three times the national average			1
then last year , " @entity5 " came to town			2
or to be more precise , the @entity29 's sister gallery -- called none other than @entity31 -- opened her gleaming doors to the public			1
boasting hundreds of masterpieces on loan from the @entity29 in @entity36 , the slick € 150 million ( $ 204 million ) museum has become an unlikely art haven , sitting in the shadow of @entity12 ' looming slag heaps			1
for retired miner @entity1 , the biggest thrill was seeing the gallery 's star attraction -- @entity44 's " @entity5 " -- a painting commemorating the 1830 revolution and familiar to everyone in @entity3			1
" i had seen it on stamps , " he says , animatedly making the small shape with his hands			0
" and here it is , " he adds , waving at the grand artwork surrounded by a throng of admirers			0
happy birthday this week marks the first anniversary of @entity31 , and already 750,000 people have visited the sleek glass and polished aluminum building , 200 kilometers north of @entity36			2
it 's a very different museum to its glamorous @entity36 sister			2
while the @entity29 -- which attracts over 9 million visitors each year -- sits on the banks of the @entity65 and overlooks elegant @entity66 , @entity12 rests atop a disused coalmine , with views of the local football stadium			1
that 's not to say @entity12 is n't a spectacular building in itself			2
designed by @entity75 architect firm @entity73 , the minimalist museum is remarkable in that it does n't separate artworks according to style or era			1
instead , the pieces -- spanning @entity81 sculpture to 19th century @entity3 painting -- are showcased together in one long light - filled gallery			2
indeed , part of the reason the museum was built , was to display some of the hundreds of thousands of artworks in storage deep under the @entity29 in @entity36			2
" @entity29 has more than 460,000 works of art , and only presents around 40,000 , " explained director @entity88 , who took on the top job at the world 's most popular museum earlier this year			1
" why take them out ? for preservation -- we are close to the @entity65 and they risk being destroyed			0
" of course , @entity31 is more than an expensive storage unit			0
it is hoped the new gallery with the internationally recognized " @entity29 " name will reinvigorate the struggling city -- much like the @entity104 in @entity105 , @entity106 , or the @entity107 in @entity108 , @entity109			1
" there was nowhere the @entity29 was as needed as much as @entity12 , " says the gallery 's director @entity110			1
new era until now , @entity12 had been better known as the place you sped through from @entity117 ' major port , to a more holiday - friendly destination			0
ravaged by both @entity120 , its cemeteries are full of the names of young soldiers -- and miners			0
when the minister of culture , @entity125 , inaugurated the @entity31 construction site , he marked the occasion with a minute silence for the 42 workers who lost their lives in a mining accident in 1974			0
almost four decades later , black coal has been replaced with gleaming glass			1
" there was a one in a million chance for the @entity29 to come here			0
it 's an unimaginable dream , " said @entity20			0
" the miners built @entity3 , they symbolize @entity3			0
this museum is all about restoring justice to this region			0

how did an *ex-mining* town in northern @entity3 become an art haven ?
one year since @entity29 opened sister gallery in @entity12 , attracts 750,000 visitors
hoped € 150m museum will reinvigorate depressed city with *24* *%* unemployment
