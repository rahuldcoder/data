@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is heading back to @entity4 after detours along the @entity6 and @entity7			1
the former @entity1 governor finished his second term in office three years ago with his political career dead in the water thanks to a well - publicized extra-marital affair and ethics violations			0
but he came away tuesday with a victory over @entity17 opponent @entity16 in the special election for a vacant @entity20 seat in the @entity1 's 1st @entity21 -- the same seat he once held			1
here 's what we 've learned , or better yet , re-learned , from @entity3 's victory 1			1
voters give politicians second chances from the start of his bid for @entity31 , @entity3 was very open on the campaign trail about the affair and made it the subject of his first tv ad			1
@entity3 asked for , and received , political redemption from the voters			1
" i want to acknowledge a @entity40 not just of second chances but third , fourth , fifth , sixth , seventh , eighth chances , because that is the reality of our shared humanity , " said @entity3 at his victory celebration tuesday night			1
" i am one imperfect man saved by @entity40 's grace			0
" he repeated that theme minutes later at a news conference with reporters			0
" i think we 're always on the search for redemption and i think this is certainly a degree of political redemption			0
" @entity16 's campaign , as well as two national @entity17 groups which contributed money and support to her campaign , highlighted the affair			0
at their only general election debate , @entity16 confronted @entity3 about his 2009 secret trip to @entity7 to see his mistress			1
and her campaign went up with a tv commercial which slammed @entity3 for using " tax dollars to visit his mistress in @entity7 , disappeared for a week leaving no one in charge , betrayed all who trusted him , then lied to cover it up			1
@entity3 , it 's a question of character			2
" the @entity77 and the @entity78 , which , combined , spent nearly $ 900,000 to try and defeat @entity3 , also spotlighted the affair in their final ads. but in the end , it was n't enough			2
candidates matter for all his political baggage , @entity3 is a veteran on the campaign trail			1
and @entity16 showed her campaign inexperience at times			0
" @entity3 may be a flawed candidate but he 's a fabulous campaigner , " said @entity88 strategist @entity87 , a former executive director of the @entity89			1
" forget the rhetoric or the policy or the delivery -- hand - to - hand , eye - to - eye he 's very good and it 's impossible to outwork him			0
" @entity3 also seemed to win this election one voter at a time			1
the candidate appeared to be everywhere in the campaign 's closing days			0
he held nearly 15 events on monday , with another 10 on @entity101			0
turnout matters we knew @entity17 voters were fired up , but the big question concerned @entity88 voters in a district that the @entity88 has held for more 30 years			1
would they vote even with their reservations about @entity3 ? the answer appears to be yes			2
it was a high turnout for a special election			1
roughly a quarter of the 18 - plus population voted , more than 140,000 votes total , according to a @entity2 analysis of the vote			0
" that seems to have helped @entity3 , " @entity2 polling director @entity119 said			1
" low turnout would have meant a lot of republicans who were reluctant to vote for him and would n't vote for a @entity124			2
high turnout turns that around : plenty of @entity88 who had misgivings about @entity3 came out to vote anyway			1
" and @entity129 @entity128 might be one reason why			0
@entity3 and his campaign repeatedly tied @entity16 to @entity128 , saying that a vote for @entity16 would also be a vote for @entity128 , who has high negatives with @entity88 voters and who most likely would become @entity20 speaker again if the @entity17 run the table and regain control of the chamber in next year 's midterm elections			1
" i 've fought hard over the years to make @entity1 a better place to call home			0
but those efforts pale now against the larger battle for the direction of our country			0
maybe that 's why @entity128 and allies have spent more than a million dollars to defeat me			0
but this contest is bigger than them or me , it 's about two different visions of how we restore @entity157 and reign in @entity4 spending , " @entity3 said , looking into the camera in a tv spot that started running district - wide last week			1
two weeks ago he even debated a cardboard cutout of @entity128 to call out @entity16 for not accepting more than one debate			0
the strategy appears to have paid off			0
location , location , location macro : the @entity166 is @entity88 country			2
@entity167 carried the district by 18 percentage points in last november 's presidential election			2
and rep. @entity171 was reelected by 27 points before he was picked by @entity88 gov. @entity173 to fill the @entity175 seat vacated by sen. @entity176 , who stepped down to take over as the head of the conservative @entity178			1
even a candidate with serious political baggage like @entity3 was able to win			1
micro : @entity3 won all five counties in the district			1
he won big where he needed to , in the conservative counties of @entity185 and @entity186 , taking around 60 % of the vote			0
he carried the district 's second most populous county , @entity190 , by 6 percentage points			0
some democrats hoped that older voters in that county , which includes @entity195 , would be turned off by @entity3 's affair			2
@entity3 narrowly carried his home base of @entity198 , where the most voters were at stake			2
that was also @entity16 's best hope			0
money does n't always matter @entity16 's campaign outspent @entity3 's operation in the closing weeks			2
and the @entity77 and @entity78 combined spent around $ 900,000 to try to defeat @entity3 , who received far less support from outside groups			2
money matters in campaign politics , but it 's just one factor in determining a race .			0

*disgraced* former gov. @entity3 overcame past *scandals* to win @entity20 seat
@entity3 is a veteran campaigner while opponent @entity215 made some *rookie* *mistakes*
*surprisingly* high turnout in solid @entity88 district helped @entity3
