-- june 2 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 , @entity6 transcript this is a @entity9			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity13 , @entity14 : it 's wednesday , i 'm @entity17 , this is @entity0 , bringing you 10 minutes of commercial - free headlines from around the globe			1
in fact , our first story is about a global response			2
first up : flotilla response @entity26 : this international reaction is aimed at @entity28 , and it is not positive			1
protesters around the world speaking out against @entity28			1
the @entity33 @entity32 criticizing the violence			2
@entity35 calling it a massacre			2
even the @entity37 , one of @entity28 's closest allies , says it 's open to an investigation			1
all of this is in response to monday , when @entity28 troops stormed a group of ships bringing aid to @entity4			1
@entity28 set up a blockade to control what goods are allowed into @entity4			1
this group of ships tried to break that blockade			2
some of the activists who were taken into custody during the incident have been released , and @entity28 says the aid that was on board the ships has been delivered into @entity4			1
the anger is over what happened on those ships , and the two sides tell very different stories			1
@entity64 , israeli deputy foreign minister : they have a history of arms smuggling and deadly terror			2
on board the ship , we found weapons prepared in advance and used against our forces			2
the organizers ' intent was violent , their method was violent , and the results were unfortunately violent			2
@entity80 , @entity81 movement legal adviser : there could not have been guns on board , and besides , there is no evidence of it			2
there is a live streaming from the @entity35 boat			2
you see @entity28 soldiers jumping out of helicopters onto the boat shooting			1
had there been crossfire at close range , some @entity28 soldier would have been shot			1
security headlines @entity26 : we 're checking out a couple security headlines now , starting with what could be a serious blow to the @entity108 terrorist group			2
it reportedly announced the death of @entity111 yesterday			2
he was the number three man in @entity108 and the commander of its operations in @entity116			2
@entity111 was also responsible for maintaining @entity108 's relationships with other terrorist groups , like the @entity119			1
one group of experts says his death is one of the most significant blows against @entity108 recently			2
but it also pointed out that the terrorist organization plans for these kinds of losses			2
in the @entity37 , @entity129 , whom you see here , made his first court appearance in connection with last november 's attack at @entity135 , @entity136			1
@entity129 , who is a @entity137 psychiatrist , is accused of killing 13 people in a shooting @entity140 's hearing was the military version of a grand jury			1
@entity129 answered questions that were asked by the judge , and his lawyers asked for an extension so they can gather evidence for the case			2
the judge agreed to that request			2
is this legit ? @entity152 , @entity14 : is this legit ? the @entity37 sees more tornadoes per year than any other country			2
true ! the @entity37 has an average of about 1,000 tornadoes a year			2
@entity157 is second with around 100			2
@entity158 @entity26 : around 25 percent of those tornadoes form in an area that 's called @entity161			1
@entity6 is part of that , and it 's where this tornado showed up on monday			1
these pictures are amazing ; look at this			2
twisters like this one can sometimes do a lot of damage			0
but early reports indicated no injuries or major problems with this one , just a lot of power lines knocked down			0
@entity161 sees a lot of twisters pop up in the spring			0
but forecasters point out that these storms can happen anywhere , at any time			0
dealing with the spill @entity26 : attorney general @entity182 says he 's launching a criminal investigation into the @entity185 oil spill			1
and down in the @entity185 , there 's more bad news for the fishing industry			1
officials have closed off more waters to fishing			0
nearly a third of the @entity185 now is off limits			1
meanwhile , @entity194 is starting the " cut and cap " plan			0
we told you about this yesterday			0
they 're going to cut part of the leaking oil well and then put a cap on it			0
hence , cut and cap			0
making the cut , though , could increase the flow of oil spilling into the @entity185 by up to 20 percent			1
now , you 've heard a lot from @entity210 since this oil leak started			0
he 's one of our reporters covering the story from down on the @entity216			1
today , he explains how hurricane season could impact the oily situation			1
( begin video ) @entity220 , @entity221 : almost five years later , signs of @entity223 are still evident in @entity224 , @entity225			0
and this year 's @entity227 hurricane forecast calls for up to 23 named storms			1
oil from the @entity194 spill is already in the barrier wetlands here			0
@entity233 , president , @entity224 : i 'm scared to death			0
imagine a storm rolling that oil up and bringing it in here and laying it down			0
@entity243 : that 's just the kind of unimaginable devastation that @entity247 , @entity248 is trying to avoid			1
@entity249 : what you see here is the tide is down right now			0
so , the water is below the basket			0
@entity243 : the @entity256 is erecting a four - and - a - half mile barrier to keep the oil from impacting protected wildlife here			0
the baskets are filled with a polymer powder which can turn the wet oil into a solid , making it easier to collect by hand			0
but what happens to these oil barriers if a major hurricane hits ? @entity268 , @entity269 : they 'll be gone just like everything else around here too			1
that category five will take out the houses and take out every building and structure on this island , probably			0
@entity243 : we 're out on part of the thick oil here in the @entity185			1
what does the oil do for hurricanes ? well , it would have a hard time developing right over the oil , because the oil actually suppresses evaporation			0
but that 's actually one of the ways that the water actually cools			1
so , between the lack of evaporation and the darkness of that oil , actually heats up the @entity185			1
this is going to actually feed it , if anything , and bring it onshore and everything with it , including this big mess			0
( @entity305 ) @entity306 @entity307 , @entity14 : today 's shoutout goes out to the students at @entity310 in @entity311 ! when would you wear a mortar board ? is it while : a ) judging , b ) graduating , c ) welding or @entity318 ) scuba diving ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! a mortar board is an academic cap , so you 'd wear it while graduating			1

@entity341 : though @entity334 services low - income neighborhoods , with obstacles that challenge every inner city school ... planning : the 54 of you have earned together a combined total of more than $ 3.85 million in merit - based scholarships			1
@entity341 : that averages to more than $ 70,000 in scholarship money per student			0

this one , we 're still not sure			0
this @entity438 video shows a bear at a zoo in @entity441			0
he 's obviously got some smooth moves			1
but right here , watch this			0
he flips it up , waits for it to drop back down , he caught it and he keeps on going			0
now , we had a reporter check into this , and experts say it 's possible with enough training			1
