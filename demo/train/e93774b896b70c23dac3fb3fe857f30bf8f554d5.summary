-- two years ago this week , the @entity2 administration hailed the advent of the " @entity4			1
" the president 's stimulus bill had passed a @entity8 - controlled @entity7 just over a year before , accompanied by rosy predictions on job creation from the administration			0
president @entity2 claimed that " the economy is headed in the right direction , " and vice president @entity11 confidently predicted the creation of 250,000 to 500,000 new jobs a month			1
meanwhile , treasury secretary @entity16 published an op - ed in the @entity18 boldly entitled " @entity19			0
" two years later , @entity20 are still waiting for the recovery			1
today 's job figures are well below the 250,000 to 500,000 jobs per month that vice president @entity11 forecast			2
this year , the economy created a dismal 77,000 jobs in april and just 69,000 jobs in may , less than half of the 150,000 jobs needed each month just to keep up with population growth			2
unemployment , which the @entity32 predicted would shrink below 6 % by april 2012 , has remained at or above 8 % for 40 straight months			0
it does n't take an economist to realize the president 's economic policies have spectacularly failed to make things better			1
yet , the president does n't seem to understand just how badly @entity20 are hurting			1
despite the more than 23 million @entity20 who remain unemployed or underemployed , the president recently claimed that the private sector is " doing fine " and that what @entity20 actually needs is more government spending and more government workers			1
in other words , more of the same			0
more stimulus spending from @entity46 that explodes the debt			2
more government picking winners and losers			0
it 's time to try something new			0
@entity55 have a plan to get our economy moving again			1
first , we need to ensure businesses are confident enough to expand and hire more workers			0
that means stopping the job - killing regulations that are strangling small businesses and reforming our burdensome and complicated tax code to fuel economic growth			0
it also means stopping a large tax increase , which is scheduled to hit next year unless @entity7 acts			0
the threat of this massive tax hike is creating serious economic uncertainty and discouraging companies from hiring more workers			1
we can create tens of thousands of new @entity20 jobs by encouraging the development of @entity20 's vast energy resources and supporting truly shovel - ready projects like the @entity79 , which would create an estimated 20,000 jobs , according to @entity81 , while boosting domestic energy production			1
we also need to protect jobs by repealing the president 's health care law , which is driving up health care costs and making it harder for small businesses to hire workers			1
the director of the @entity90 testified that the health care law will mean 800,000 fewer jobs over the next decade			1
those are jobs @entity20 ca n't afford to lose			1
finally , we need to cut reckless government spending and tackle the mounting debt crisis			2
@entity20 's brightest days are ahead			2
but if we do n't take action soon , our country could end up in the kind of financial disaster @entity100 and @entity101 are facing			0
our children and grandchildren should not have to pay for @entity46 's inability to stick to a budget			0
we owe it to the next generation to leave the country better than we found it			0
the first step on the road to real recovery is not doubling down on the failed policies we 've seen over the past 3Â½ years			1
@entity55 are ready to get to work to jump - start our economy			0
we hope @entity8 will join us			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity116 .			2
