@entity0 , @entity1 -- in patches across the @entity1 capital , many earthquake survivors are not waiting for an international clearing and rebuilding effort to begin			1
they are pulling out shovels , wood and cement to slowly repair and rebuild themselves			0
" this is what we have to do now , " @entity12 said as he hammered away at huge , fallen slabs of a @entity15 office building , breaking them into chunks to be shoveled into a truck and taken away			1
@entity15 is a telecommunications company			0
@entity12 and three friends working with him at @entity15 expected the company to pay them for their hard labor , but the group insists that they and others who stayed in the earthquake zone are eager to start clearing rubble and building what they can			1
" the people who left [ @entity0 ] have no hope , " he said , his face dripping with sweat			0
" elsewhere in @entity0 , businesses and families repaired cinderblock walls and pounded new beams into fractured roofs			0
one work crew near the airport replaced several broken sewer pipes that were part of a system set up for their neighborhood			2
but this individual rebuilding alarms teams of engineers studying the damage in @entity1 after the 7.0 - magnitude earthquake january 12			1
" it worries me , " said @entity52 , a @entity1 - @entity53 engineer from @entity54 who is part of a volunteer assessment team working with the @entity58 ' mission in @entity1			1
@entity61 and his crew say many @entity1 are using broken pieces of buildings as construction material , including the metal rebar , or reinforcement bars , that critically strengthen concrete but now lie twisted and bent in the rubble			1
that makes the bars weak and potentially unsafe			0
but @entity1 are turning to what 's available -- even though the materials might be deemed unsafe -- to rebuild structures that ultimately may be declared unsound			0
" this is a problem , " fellow engineer @entity74 said			1
" these things can just collapse all over again			2
" indeed , the @entity15 building where @entity12 is working contains massive cracks , is missing a two - story wall and leans over the area he 's cleaning up			2
asked if he 's worried that the place could collapse , undermining his backbreaking work , @entity12 responds , " we ca n't control that			0
that is up to @entity86			0
