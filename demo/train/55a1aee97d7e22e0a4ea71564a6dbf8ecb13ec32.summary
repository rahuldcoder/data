-- @entity2 's new song " @entity4 " featuring @entity3 dropped three days ago and the video has already racked up more than 31 million views on @entity7			1
that 's actually a pretty slow start for the @entity11 superstar , considering " @entity14 " became the first video to pass two billion hits a week ago , while his follow - up single " gentleman " also broke a record for the most views in 24 hours -- it currently has 694 million views on @entity7			1
the " @entity4 " video shows @entity2 taking @entity3 on a ridiculous guided tour of what he does best -- hardcore drinking , @entity11 - style			1
this involves endless bomb shots , hanging out at a jjimjilbang ( @entity11 bathhouse ) , throwing up and karaoke with strangers -- with one particularly surreal scene of @entity3 , @entity2 and and two @entity11 women blithely skipping through an amusement park , presumably drunk			1
true to the premise , @entity2 told @entity0 he was actually hungover when the song came out			0
promotions for the new song kicked off sunday on @entity36 , with the unlikely trio of @entity38 , @entity2 and @entity3 heading to a local karaoke bar in @entity40 and bringing the house down with their yodeling			1
we asked @entity2 to talk about his hot new collaboration			0
@entity0 : how were you introduced to @entity3 ? psy : my manager @entity48 put me in touch with him at my request			2
when i first wrote this track , i thought that @entity3 's slow rapping would fit perfectly with my rapping on this track , so i asked him to put me in touch with @entity3 and it 's how it all happened			2
@entity0 : who came up with the ideas for the video ? psy : when i first spoke with @entity3 on the phone to discuss the collaboration idea , @entity3 loved the title of the song , and i immediately suggested to him during that first conversation to shoot the music video in @entity68 and show us getting drunk and getting hungover in the most traditional @entity11 way			1
@entity0 : where was the video filmed and who chose the locations ? psy : it was shot in @entity77			1
i chose that location because @entity3 only had 18 hours to shoot the video			2
since he was going to arrive at @entity80 , i wanted to shoot the entire video in an area that is the closest to the airport to get the most out of those 18 hours			0
@entity0 : what was the filming process like ? psy : i initially told him that the shoot would be very relaxed and that he would only be in five scenes to entice him to come to @entity91 and shoot the video			0
he ended up being in more than 20 scenes in more than 10 different locations within those 18 hours			0
@entity0 : why did you decide to go with a different director this time ? psy : i co-directed this video so technically it 's the same director , but my co-director [ @entity100 ] was different from that of " @entity14 " and " @entity102 " [ co-directed by @entity103 ] because the type of the song is different -- electronic dance music versus 808 hip hop -- and i also wanted my fans to experience something different			2
@entity0 : what surprised you about working with @entity3 ? psy : we all know how diligent @entity3 is			2
he is all about working hard every time -- haha			0
i was very surprised working with him because he ended up shooting 20 different scenes in a short time -- it was a tough schedule , but he was a total pro and i appreciated it so much			0
@entity0 : how did you celebrate passing two billion views of " @entity14 " ? psy : i really did not have a chance or time to celebrate because i immediately flew to @entity40 for the @entity124 appearance and other promos			0
@entity0 : what are some events / concerts / collaborations coming up for you ? although i can not say at this moment who i collaborated with this past year [ for an upcoming ep ] , but what i can tell you is that i worked with some big name artists ! @entity2 's new ep is slated to come out later this year			1
the lead single on the ep " @entity139 " will be released this summer .			0
