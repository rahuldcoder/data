-- i almost always get asked the same question : how can it possibly be the " end of men " when there are so few female elected officials -- when men still hold the reins of political power ? it 's an excellent question			1
until now , i 've answered by pointing to statistical trends and future projections			0
always , i ask people to take a leap of faith			0
but after this election , i feel like i am on so much more solid ground			2
the women 's vote did not turn out to be historic in the way pundits predicted before the election			1
yes , more women voted for president @entity24 , but not in record numbers			1
the gender gap was in fact a little smaller in this election than in 2008			2
yes , women were important in certain states , but so were young people , african - americans and @entity32 , who , together , make up @entity24 's new winning coalition			1
what 's more , women did not even constitute a unified vote			1
married women tended to vote for @entity38 , while single women went for @entity24			1
what changed in this election was that women accumulated power in a calm and measured way , and began to look for the first time much less like outsiders to the political process			1
@entity53 , arguably a state populated by the greatest concentration of political insiders and obsessives , gave us our first ever matriarchy -- a delegation of @entity57 , @entity58 and governor that is entirely female			1
we elected a record number of women to the @entity58			1
one of those new senators is @entity63 , who over the rest of her career has the potential to embody women 's transition from outsider status to right in the thick of things			1
what about the " war on women , " the constantly mutating arguments over reproductive rights ? on this , women won handily			2
in @entity79 , democrat @entity78 ran against @entity80 , who claimed that in " legitimate rape " the female body shuts down pregnancy			0
@entity78 not only beat @entity80 , she trounced him , winning by 16 points			0
before the election , when @entity78 was still behind in the polls , women looked beleaguered and marginalized , subjected to lectures by men about their internal plumbing			1
afterward , it 's those who did the lecturing who seem like fringe , marginalized characters			2
in fact , practically all the candidates with the improbable @entity80 - type theories lost			0
( check out this scorecard on @entity100 for a complete accounting			0
) once , not all that long ago , women seemed like newcomers to the political scene , alien to its settled ways			1
women were scrutinized in their every public move as though they were a newly discovered species			2
think back to @entity111 's presidential campaign			0
could she be tough enough on @entity113 ? soft enough to cry ? would she wear red suits to all her big speeches ? if so , what did that mean ? now that the sight of a woman in a roomful of senators is becoming less unusual , our analysis becomes much less crude			0
debates about image and optics are ceding to debates about actual policies			1
we also realize that women come in all types			0
more are likely to vote @entity131			0
among female voters , more than 50 % tend to favor abortion rights			0
@entity80 , for example , split the vote among white women			1
@entity139 @entity138 @entity137 , who is strongly pro-life , kept her seat			0
just as men have wide varieties of views , so do women			0
voting as a bloc is something you only do if you 're disenfranchised			0
voting the way you want is a sign that you 're gaining power			0
the important thing is for women to participate in the political process and speak for themselves			1
workplace studies from the 1970s showed that when women reached a third of an office population , their presence no longer seemed unusual			0
the @entity58 will be one - fifth female			1
we 're not there yet , but we 're getting close			0
in this election , people are still discussing historic firsts -- the first openly lesbian senator ( democrat @entity165 of @entity166 ) , the first @entity168 - @entity167 woman ( democrat @entity165 of @entity169 )			2
slowly , over time , we want these firsts to fade away and for female senators to be elected without that fact alone constituting a news story			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity175 .			2

@entity175 : the women 's vote did not turn out to be historic in this election
@entity175 : but for the first time , women look less like outsiders in the political process
for example , we elected a record number of women to the @entity58 , she says
@entity175 : we will debate less about women 's image and more about their actual policies
