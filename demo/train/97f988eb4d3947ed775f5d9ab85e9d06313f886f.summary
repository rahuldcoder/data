-- in my previous @entity0 opinion piece , i explained to readers my reasons why president @entity5 should not be re-elected			0
many keen readers responded : if those are the reasons to vote against @entity5 , then what are the reasons to vote for @entity10 ? opinion : why debate is crucial for @entity5 , too this is an entirely fair question ; @entity10 's obligation is to make the case to the @entity17 people why he should be president			1
here , then , are my reasons to vote for @entity10			1
business and management career success the @entity17 economy is in desperate need of a turnaround artist			2
@entity10 has made his career in the private sector doing exactly that -- turning around failing business and enterprises			1
during his time at @entity31 , @entity10 was responsible for building companies that @entity17 shop at everyday -- @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , and @entity37			2
of course , not all of his investments were successful and some companies failed , but on the whole , @entity31 's returns for its investors were nothing short of stellar			0
in its independent analysis of @entity31 's record , @entity45 reported , " @entity31 produced about $ 2.5 billion in gains for its investors in the 77 deals , on about $ 1.1 billion invested			0
overall , @entity31 recorded roughly 50 % to 80 % annual gains in this period , which experts said was among the best track records for buyout firms in that era			0
" how to watch , clip and share the debate @entity10 was one of the most successful venture capitalists of the late 1980s and 1990s			1
the @entity5 administration attacks @entity10 's business career , but praises that of billionaire investor and @entity64 ceo @entity63			1
that 's quite the double standard			0
perhaps , they should heed president @entity67 , who called @entity10 's business record " sterling			1
" opinion : @entity5 , light a cig ; @entity10 , throw deep @entity10 's success did n't end at @entity31			1
in 1999 , he left to rescue the @entity72 from the verge of collapse			0
@entity10 took control and managed the @entity72 from debt and disaster into a national success			2
if @entity10 can thrive in the private sector , where 5 of 10 small businesses fail within five years , and the public sector , where regulations and inefficiencies often stifle success , surely he can help the @entity17 economy back to its feet			1
executive governing experience @entity10 took office as governor of @entity91 in 2003 , at a time when the state was undergoing its own recession			2
after the dot - com bubble burst , @entity91 lost more than 200,000 jobs and had a $ 3 billion budget shortfall			0
@entity10 closed the budget deficit without raising state taxes , but by raising fees and closing tax loopholes			1
although the number of jobs created during his term was ranked near the bottom compared with other states , @entity91 did progress from shedding jobs to creating tens of thousands			0
the unemployment rate dropped from 5.6 % to 4.7 %			0
and he accomplished all this with a @entity113 legislature			0
according to the @entity114 , @entity91 topped the nation in eighth grade math and reading scores in 2007 , the last year of @entity10 's term			1
while @entity10 did inherit what was arguably already the best school system in the country , he continued his own conservative reforms and was a good steward of the state education system in place			2
today it consistently ranks as the best state education system in the @entity17			0
and thanks to @entity10 's state - led health care reform , in 2012 , @entity91 had the lowest percentage of uninsured , at 4.9 % , according to a @entity132 survey			1
character and leadership to hear many in the mainstream media describe @entity10 , he 's out - of - touch , stiff , insensitive and uncaring			1
in reality , @entity10 , the man , husband and leader , is a deeply benevolent , compassionate , and generous @entity139 but he must tell his story			1
for example , in july 1996 , @entity10 closed down all of @entity31 and sent his employees to @entity143 to search for the 14 - year - old daughter of @entity145 , a partner at @entity31			2
she had snuck off to a rave party in @entity143 and had been missing for three days			0
@entity10 set up a command search center in @entity143 , coordinated with the @entity149 , put up posters all over the city , and sent out alerts			2
it was n't long before the young girl was found in a basement suffering from ecstasy withdrawal			0
referring to @entity10 's efforts , @entity145 said : " it was the most amazing thing , and i 'll never forget this to the day i die			1
" opinion : why you should n't vote for @entity5 at the @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 told the tear - jerking story of their 14 - year - old son , @entity166 , who was diagnosed with terminal hodgkin 's disease			0
@entity10 visited him frequently , becoming a close friend			2
at @entity166 's request , he wrote the young man 's will and gave the eulogy at his funeral			0
these are the untold stories of a good and decent man			0
in 2011 , @entity10 and his wife , @entity178 , gave almost 30 % of their income to charity , more than $ 4 million			1
as @entity10 likes to say , compassion is n't measured by welfare or food stamps , but by the ability to lift people off welfare and food stamps			2
each year he gives millions of his own dollars to help people in such a way			0
@entity10 's plan after four years of president @entity5 's failed economic leadership , @entity10 would bring to the @entity193 a specific , detailed plan for returning to fiscal responsibility and job creation			1
his plan would cut federal spending as a share of gdp to 20 % by 2016			1
it would reform our complex tax code by reducing tax rates 20 % across the board while eliminating loopholes , specifically those for the highest earners , and maintaining revenue neutrality			1
it would also reduce the @entity17 corporate tax rate , now the highest in the world , to 25 %			2
under a @entity10 administration , the largest drivers of our debt would be reformed by giving more choice and responsibility to individuals rather than bureaucrats for managing their @entity219 and @entity220			0
in the case of @entity223 , it would be block granted and sent back to the states			0
@entity10 's plan will reduce onerous regulations and taxes , like @entity229 , and usher in a new era of fiscal certainty for business owners and entrepreneurs			1
in debates , presidential candidates ' tics and tells matter @entity10 will also champion energy independence , will approve the @entity240 pipeline and stop the @entity242 's regulatory war on coal			1
borrowing from his experience in @entity91 , @entity10 will push for more school choice for parents and students , performance pay for teachers , and , with 3 million skilled jobs going begging , new skills training for skilled workers			0
finally , his pick of rep. @entity254 as his vice presidential candidate cements his conservative credentials as a fiscal reformer bent on tackling the debt and entitlements , something our current president ignored			0
@entity10 's experience and success in both government and business , his leadership in public office , as well as his compassion in private , make him a man qualified and equipped to lead @entity17 's comeback , certainly more qualified than @entity5 before his candidacy for the @entity193 in 2008			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity275 .			0

@entity275 says @entity10 's business *acumen* gives him an *advantage* at fixing economy
@entity275 : @entity10 is *portrayed* as uncaring , but he is compassionate and generous
@entity275 : he would cut federal spending as a share of gdp to 20 % , reform tax code
@entity10 will approve the @entity240 pipeline and stop @entity242 's war on coal , he says
