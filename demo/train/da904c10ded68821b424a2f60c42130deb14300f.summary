editor 's note : @entity2 is on @entity3 nightly at 7 and 9 et and also is host of a conservative national radio talk show			1
@entity2 has some lines @entity7 can use in tonight 's speech to articulate his vision for change @entity11 ( @entity3 ) -- campaigns are ugly			1
watching the way politicians act makes you long for the respect and self - control of the @entity18			2
throughout , there are legitimate attacks and outright lies			0
every once in a while , i get a call on my radio show from someone telling me that @entity27 is secretly a @entity28 , who admitted it in an interview with @entity32 , and has a fake birth certificate			0
no , no , and no. as i tell them , there are legitimate reasons not to vote for @entity27 , no need to make them up			0
but the newest target is @entity40			1
let 's take a quick look at just a fraction of what she has faced in her first few days as @entity7 's choice for vice president			0
ireport.com : do you think @entity40 is being treated unfairly ? " @entity40 believes @entity50 told her to go to war with @entity52 ! " there has been some hard - core journalistic malpractice on this one			1
the @entity55 ran this headline about a speech she gave at her church : " @entity40 : @entity60 ' a task that is from @entity50 ' " in the story , they omit the first part of the sentence they 're quoting along with the entire previous sentence for good measure			1
here are her actual words : " pray for our military men and women who are striving to do what is right			0
also , for this country , that our leaders , our national leaders , are sending them out on a task that is from @entity50			1
that 's what we have to make sure that we 're praying for , that there is a plan and that that plan is @entity50 's plan			1
" @entity40 is clearly praying that we 're doing the right thing in @entity52 , something sensible for an introspective woman of faith concerned about the lives of our troops to do			1
she 's not saying that she just received a text message from @entity92 's @entity91 ordering her to launch missiles			0
and for those of you who think politicians asking @entity50 for guidance is offensive , might i remind you of this famous politician 's prayer : " give me the wisdom to do what is right and just			1
and make me an instrument of your will			0
" -- @entity27 " she has no experience ! " it 's fair to assume that @entity27 believed he was qualified to be in the @entity109 when he announced he was running for president			2
at that point , he had been a @entity112 for 767 days			0
when @entity40 was announced as a vice presidential candidate , she had been the governor of @entity115 for 634 days			1
while i 'm sure those extra 133 days were filled with personal discovery , i ca n't imagine anyone seriously trying to make the case that @entity27 is experienced and @entity40 is n't			1
unless , of course , you 're @entity122 , who said a @entity40 presidency would be a really " scary thing " because she has been " governor of @entity115 for ... for less than two years ! " ( @entity122 originally expressed his presidential preference for @entity27 in december 2006 , when he had been a senator for less than two years			1
) more importantly , @entity40 's career has been filled with executive experience			1
she 's the only one of the four in this race who has run a business , town , and / or state ( a state that gives her crucial energy experience in the middle of an energy crisis )			2
when @entity27 's campaign complains that @entity40 would be one heartbeat away from the presidency , they should consider that their candidate would be zero heartbeats away			1
" but @entity27 is running a huge campaign -- @entity40 was just a small town mayor ! " believe it or not , this one was actually trotted out by @entity27 himself			1
" my understanding is , is that gov. @entity40 's town of @entity148 has , i think , 50 employees			2
we 've got 2,500 in this campaign			2
i think the budget is maybe $ 12 million a year			0
we have a budget of about three times that just for the month			0
" apparently , @entity27 missed that she 's become the governor of @entity115 in the interim			0
why would he compare his current duties with her former duties ? well , since he announced his candidacy , @entity27 has raised about $ 22 million a month			0
that 's a large organization for sure , unless you are directly comparing it to @entity40 , who is handling state revenues that are about 61 times as large , or more than $ 1.3 billion per month			2
" @entity40 only supports abstinence to be taught in sex - ed ! " this claim is usually followed by a super classy comment about her daughter and the use of contraception , but the premise is false			1
@entity40 has n't said she does n't want condoms discussed in sex - ed , calling their discussion " relatively benign			1
" " i 'm pro-contraception , and i think kids who may not hear about it at home should hear about it in other avenues			0
so i am not anti-contraception			0
but , yeah , abstinence is another alternative that should be discussed with kids			0
i do n't have a problem with that , " @entity40 said			1
@entity186 is hardly an extreme point of view in @entity189 today			0
" if she cares about children with special needs , then why did she cut spending on them by 62 percent ? " actually , @entity40 almost tripled their funding in only three years from $ 26,900 per student to $ 73,840 per student			2
incidentally , the amount of government money you spend on a specific group does n't equal the amount you care for that group , but that 's another story for another column			2
all of these represent just a small percentage of the bizarre collection of claims being thrown at @entity40 by her opponents and some in the media -- who are desperately hoping something will stick			2
i leave you with my favorite so far : the @entity215 rumors that she harbors racism against @entity217			0
if true , she sure has a strange way of expressing it -- her husband , @entity220 , is half @entity221			2
to balance that out , she must really love his other half			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .			0

@entity2 : many of the things you 've heard about @entity40 are n't true
@entity2 : she did n't say the @entity52 war is a task from @entity50
@entity40 has substantial executive experience in several jobs , @entity2 says .
@entity2 : she does n't oppose *teaching* contraception in sex - ed classes
