-- the @entity1 announced it will stop delivering first - class mail on saturdays , expecting to save about $ 2 billion a year			1
given the rapid rate of decline in letter mail and the loss of revenues , this is a welcome cost - cutting move			1
but this change will not make the @entity10 sustainable for the long term			1
cost cutting would not have made the horse and buggy business sustainable in the dawning age of the automobile			0
the same is true of typewriters during the advent of word processors , or slide rules when calculators arrived			0
there is a natural limit to how far costs can be cut , and to how much that can help the @entity10 survive in the new communications marketplace			1
the @entity10 's business model needs fundamental change for it to thrive and avoid liquidation			1
those reforms must focus not only on reducing costs , but also on allowing the service to generate new sources of revenue from its existing assets			1
the experience in other countries suggests that this is possible			0
following that lead , the first steps should include corporatization and de-monopolization			0
first - class letter mail -- by far the @entity10 's most profitable type -- has fallen by a stunning one - third since its 2001 peak , while overall mail volume is down by almost 25 %			1
revenues have also dropped which , when combined with high costs , have created the @entity10 's own fiscal cliff			1
the service lost almost $ 16 billion in 2012 and is now losing about $ 25 million per day			0
it has hit the limit of its $ 15 billion credit line with the @entity53 , and has only enough cash for a few weeks of operations			0
given the explosion in cheap , instantaneous , electronic communications , none of this is surprising			0
mail delivery is now like offering transportation by horse in the dawning automobile era			2
unlike horse transportation , however , it 's possible for mail delivery services to remain viable , innovative , self - sustaining businesses even in the electronic age , as posts around the world have shown			1
for the @entity10 to survive and thrive , however , @entity71 needs to step up , and soon			1
@entity71 must determine what level of physical mail service , if any , is necessary for government to ensure when there are many electronic alternatives			2
second , it must decide how it ( as opposed to the @entity10 ) plans to pay for that service level			1
dimensions of such guaranteed service include the geographic area to be covered , what rate will be charged ( and whether it will be uniform across areas ) , and how frequent mail service will be			2
@entity71 then needs to free up the @entity10 to become a more commercial entity			1
but that ca n't happen unless it also eliminates both of the service 's monopolies ( one over mail delivery and the other over mailbox use ) and changes its organizational structure			1
repeal of the monopolies is necessary because the service will never get the freedom to pursue new lines of business aggressively , and thus to generate new revenue , unless it is subject to the discipline of competition			2
@entity104 : how to build a better postal service changes in the service 's organizational structure are necessary to attract the management talent and prompt the changes required to become self - sustaining			1
the first step is corporatization , which makes the service subject to the standard set of corporate laws and norms associated with a large commercial entity			0
although it creates ownership shares in the new entity , those shares are not sold to the public			0
this is distinct from privatization in which shares are created and then sold to investors			0
postal corporatization would be a big improvement			2
it provides managers with more focused incentives and helps to raise the additional capital necessary to pursue new services and lines of business			2
focused incentives are critical since the only bright spots in the service 's business are in its most competitive , such as parcel delivery			2
the @entity141 now lags behind most other developed countries in all such reforms			0
all 27 members of the @entity145 have eliminated their postal monopolies			1
@entity147 repealed its delivery monopoly in 1998 , @entity149 in 2003			0
@entity150 and the @entity151 repealed in 2007 and 2009 , respectively			0
the threat of competition associated with monopoly repeal has helped postal services in those countries to become more efficient , more effective enterprises			1
other countries are also far ahead on organizational reforms			0
@entity150 's post -- now @entity161 -- was privatized in 2005 and has become a major player in the global delivery and logistics business			2
it reformed its compensation structure , brought in managers from other sectors and modernized its delivery network			0
it operates in 220 countries and is now the world 's largest courier company			1
the @entity174 post -- @entity175 -- will be privatized this year			0
one hundred percent of the formerly government - owned post in the @entity151 is now privately owned			2
@entity177 was corporatized in 1987 , while all government subsidies were eliminated in 1988			0
@entity177 has become a successful , innovative global company focusing on parcel delivery , logistics and other businesses			0
there is no reason why the @entity10 can not also become a leader in the global delivery sector			1
it already has a far - flung network of sorting centers and letter carriers that allows it to deliver physical documents to every @entity141 address six days every week			1
given the size and diversity of the @entity141 , that is an amazing feat. it could use that capability to deliver mail " the last mile " in innovative ways , such as assisting new businesses in the area to advertise			2
it could also tailor its delivery frequency to the demand for home delivery in a particular region			0
some mailers may want to saturate an area with mail , while others may want slow , steady delivery			0
the current " one size fits all " approach is clearly inefficient			0
the @entity10 would also be freed up to seek new revenue by forming alliances with global logistics and courier companies			2
moreover , it has a massive portfolio of real estate that includes large buildings in prime downtown locations as well as massive sorting centers throughout the country			1
its real estate alone is likely worth tens of billions of dollars			1
selectively selling some of those assets would free up resources for the service to pursue new market opportunities			0
indeed , it probably has enough assets so that -- if properly managed -- it could recapitalize its core business without a taxpayer bailout			0
but @entity71 must act to allow that to happen			0
as the experience in many other countries shows , there is no reason for the @entity10 's agonizing decline and impending collapse			1
if @entity71 borrows from international experience , and acts decisively to reform postal policy , the venerable @entity10 can also emerge as a viable company in the internet age			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity248 .			2

@entity248 : @entity10 wo n't deliver first - class mail on saturdays to cut costs
@entity248 says it 's a good move , but @entity10 must be upgraded to survive
he says other nations have ended mail monopolies , empowered postal services
@entity248 : @entity10 has real estate assets , could be *transformed* for today 's world
