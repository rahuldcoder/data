there 's no other word to describe @entity3			1
sixteen years after her affair with president @entity5 became public knowledge , she 's returned to the limelight with a campaign against cyberbullying -- of which she claims to have been " patient zero			2
" ignore the fact that she was patently not the primary victim in the @entity15 affair ( poor @entity16 was ) or that any comparison with someone suffering a disease , especially at a time when people are dropping dead from @entity22 , is tasteless in the extreme			1
what 's most depressing is that when she rejoined the public stage , she said she was inspired to speak out by the story of @entity28 , a student who committed suicide after a video of him kissing another boy went up online			1
@entity33 was the victim of societal homophobia as well as an invasion of his privacy , and his death makes any comparison with @entity3 's self - imposed troubles ridiculous			1
moreover , @entity33 died in 2010			0
@entity3 has decided to revisit his cause in 2014 , suggesting that the timing may have less to do with him than it does with @entity16			2
and , of course , this will be embarrassing for @entity16			0
@entity3 has joined @entity46 , which will allow her to make uncensored remarks in the course of the 2016 campaign			0
and @entity3 has also lashed out at the way the @entity52 machine trashed her in its desire to protect @entity5 's reputation ( as it was paid to do -- she had an affair with the @entity58 , not an anonymous bank manager no one gave a damn about )			2
another view : stop judging @entity3 all of which will give ammunition to @entity16 's critics on both the right and left			1
the right wo n't have to waste its own resources reminding people of the seedier side of the @entity5 years -- @entity3 can do that now			0
and @entity72 opponents to the left of @entity16 will rejoice that someone is perpetuating the narrative that the @entity76 are gangsters who toy with the lives of others			0
@entity3 's new cyberbullying angle is inspired : a significant number of @entity84 liberals must live in terror of unflattering / undressed photos of them getting out online			1
but while @entity3 grabs some tv time talking about her own liberties , she forgets those of her fellow sisters -- the mistreated wives			0
imagine that your husband was caught cheating and the contents of your marriage were discussed every night on television			0
would you feel happy about his mistress reappearing 16 years later to drag the whole thing up again , and even to play the victim ? does @entity16 not have a right to put this scandal behind her and have a political identity separate from her husband 's ? @entity3 says that she wants to take on the " shame game			1
" but what she did all those years ago and what she 's doing now makes her a perfect candidate for a good , old - fashioned shaming .			0

@entity111 : @entity3 's return to public stage is shameless in several ways
she 's not the victim , and it 's tasteless to call herself " patient zero " of online bullying , he says
he says she *downplays* own *guilt* in affair , *humiliates* @entity16 once again
@entity111 : her presence gives ammunition to @entity16 's critics on right and left
