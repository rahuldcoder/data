-- long before our traveling friends had @entity4 and @entity5 to taunt us , they had postcards			2
so what better way to celebrate @entity9 , marked annually on october 9 , than thumbing through one of the biggest archives of postcards ever amassed ? @entity14 entrepreneur @entity13 began collecting the cards at the end of the 19th century as souvenirs from trips taken to expand his electrical goods business			1
friends and relatives soon pitched in to help supplement his hoard , which passed to his daughter , @entity24 , on his death in 1931			0
the collection contains more than 54,000 monochrome and colorful over-painted photographs depicting scenes from 140 countries , including @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32			1
some of the best postcards have been gathered in a book , " @entity35 in @entity36 : the @entity37 , " by @entity38			2
it 's available from @entity14 company @entity40 and @entity42			1
@entity9 celebrates the anniversary of the 1874 creation of the @entity45 , an international organization linking mail services around the world			1
postcards appeared about the same time , with picture postcards following soon after			2
accidents and natural disasters back then , postcards were n't just for stirring envy among friends and relations			2
they were often used to send day - to - day messages rather than just greetings from vacation spots			0
as well as idyllic scenes , @entity13 's collection depicts cultural differences and news events , such as accidents and natural disasters			1
such postcards were often gathered in albums as mementos in the same way that subsequent generations would collect family vacation snaps			0
sadly , the sending of postcards is now a tradition in decline			0
in 1951 , 4.5 billion were delivered in the @entity74 , falling to 1.4 billion in 2010 and fewer than 1 billion today			0
it 's interesting to speculate how @entity13 would 've adapted to the world of online updates			1
as a businessman whose work involved technology , it 's possible he would 've been ahead of the curve , tweeting and uploading images from his travels			0
then again , such was his enthusiasm for his collection , a post-postcard world might 've lacked the same appeal .			0
