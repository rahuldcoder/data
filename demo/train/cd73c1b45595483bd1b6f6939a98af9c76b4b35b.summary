@entity0 -- the @entity2 has given big business , unions and nonprofits more power to spend freely in federal elections , a major turnaround that threatens a century of government efforts to regulate the power of corporations to bankroll @entity13 politics			1
a 5 - 4 conservative majority crafted a narrow overhaul of federal campaign spending thursday that could have an immediate effect on this year 's congressional midterm elections			1
the justices eased long - standing restrictions on " independent spending " by corporations and unions in political campaigns			1
" when government seeks to use its full power , including the criminal law , to command where a person may get his or her information or what distrusted source he or she may not hear , it uses censorship to control thought , " justice @entity25 wrote for the majority			1
" @entity41 confirms the freedom to think for ourselves			0
" the opinion radically alters the election calculus , offering greater spending flexibility for a broader range of for - profit and nonprofit groups seeking a voice in the crowded national political debate			1
hours after the ruling , president @entity52 responded , saying the court has given " the special interests and their lobbyists even more power in @entity0 -- while undermining the influence of average @entity13 who make small contributions to support their preferred candidates			1
" in a statement , he said he is telling his administration " to get to work immediately with @entity63 on this issue			0
we are going to talk with bipartisan congressional leaders to develop a forceful response to this decision			0
the public interest requires nothing less			0
" " the @entity2 has given a green light to a new stampede of special interest money in our politics , " @entity52 said			2
" it is a major victory for big oil , @entity78 banks , health insurance companies and the other powerful interests that marshal their power every day in @entity0 to drown out the voices of everyday @entity13			1
" reaction on the other side said the ruling was long overdue			2
" the @entity2 's decision today is a victory for the @entity41 and the right of all @entity13 to participate in the political process , " said @entity86 , who successfully argued the case for the conservative @entity88			0
in a dissent to the opinion , justice @entity93 wrote , " in a democratic society , the long - standing consensus on the need to limit corporate campaign spending should outweigh the wooden applications of judge - made rules			1
" he added , " the court 's ruling threatens to undermine the integrity of elected institutions around the nation			2
" the case was the first one heard on the bench for newest justice @entity110 , and she voted in dissent with her three more liberal colleagues			2
the issue hinged on whether corporations ' ability to pour money into election campaigns could be strictly regulated , or whether corporations have free - speech rights to spend their cash to influence elections , just as individual donors do			1
in this ruling , the justices also nullified earlier rulings upholding the core of a 6 - year - old federal law aimed at curbing corporate campaign spending			1
under current law , there are severe restrictions on campaign ads used by corporations for federal elections			1
they generally must be issue - focused -- talking about abortion or taxes , for instance -- and not expressly supporting or opposing a candidate			2
those limits have now been generally removed			0
the specific case grew out of a documentary on @entity144			0
produced last year by @entity88 , " @entity144 : the movie " was a scorching attack on the then - presidential candidate			2
the filmmakers wanted to promote it during the heat of the 2008 primary season , but a federal court blocked any ads , as well as airings on cable television 's video on demand			2
on that specific question , the justices ruled against @entity88 , saying federal restrictions on broadcast ads are appropriate			1
" @entity88 's narrower arguments are not sustainable under a fair reading of the statute , " @entity25 wrote			0
the @entity0 - based nonprofit corporation and advocacy organization balked at campaign finance rules that would have required disclosure of its financial backers , and restrictions on when the film could air			1
it was financed with a mix of corporate and individual donations			0
navigating the complex , ever - evolving landscape of election money rules has spurred a cottage industry of financial , political and legal armies , ready to do battle over the money and the message			1
the crux of this dispute , like others before it , is just how far the government may go to regulate campaign spending and campaign ads. in his opinion , @entity25 acknowledged that , but said @entity13 should be trusted to decide competing election issues			2
" the appearance of influence or access , " he wrote , " will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy			0
" " our nation 's speech dynamic is changing , and informative voices should not have to circumvent onerous restrictions to exercise their first amendment rights , " @entity25 said			1
" the censorship we now confront is vast in its reach			0
" but @entity93 , who read part of his harsh dissent from the bench , said , " the court 's opinion is thus a rejection of the common sense of the @entity13 people , who have recognized a need to prevent corporations from undermining self - government since the founding			1
" justice @entity219 and chief justice @entity220 were key to the ruling , agreeing with their more conservative colleagues			2
@entity219 replaced moderate justice @entity224 , who upheld past corporate restrictions in 2003 , when the high court last confronted the issue			0
section 203 of the comprehensive @entity229 of 2002 , widely known as the @entity231 law , bans the broadcast of " electioneering communication " by corporations , trade groups , unions and some issue advocacy groups , if the material would air close to election dates and identify candidates by name or image			0
the law also requires an on - screen notice of the groups financing such ads , as well as public disclosure of all who donated to the sponsoring organizations			0
the landmark @entity231 law took effect the day after the november 2002 elections			0
among its many provisions are a ban on " soft money , " the unlimited and unregulated contributions to national political parties ; a ban , in the 60 days before an election , on advocacy ads , those criticizing or supporting a candidate 's stand on an issue ; contribution limits ; and donor disclosure requirements			0
much of @entity231 remains unaffected by the high court 's latest ruling , including the current ban on large , unregulated donations to political parties and the candidates themselves by corporations			0
the case also does not affect political action committees , separate groups created by corporations , unions and others that can contribute directly to federal candidates			1
pac money has a $ 5,000 - per - candidate limit , and must be funded through voluntary contributions from employees , members or individuals , not by direct corporate or union treasuries			1
the ruling could have far - reaching effects beyond the federal arena			1
twenty - two states have similar bans on corporate spending in state and local elections			1
restrictions on money in gubernatorial , legislative and even judicial races could soon be a thing of the past			0
" @entity308 was already bulked up with the potential of campaign ad spending , " said @entity304 , president of @entity305 and @entity1 's consultant on political television advertising			2
" now it 's on steroids			0
" excerpts of the movie and the ads can be viewed online at @entity316			0
the case is @entity88 v. @entity318 ( 08 - 205 ) .			0

new : ruling gives special interests " more power in @entity0 , " president says
big business , unions , nonprofits get more power to spend freely in federal elections
majority : " speech dynamic is changing , " and " onerous restrictions " need to be *avoided*
dissent : need to limit spending should outweigh " applications of judge - made rules "
