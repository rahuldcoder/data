the @entity0 got it right on " net neutrality			1
" so did president @entity4 , who took a bold stand in favor of keeping the @entity7 free			2
so did leaders such as @entity9			2
@entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 , and the rev. @entity13 , one of the architects of " @entity20 " protests and a member of the national board of the @entity19			1
so did the @entity21 , as well as more than 100 social justice and civil rights groups			1
and so did countless progressive , people - powered groups , such as @entity26 , an online community ( which i helped to found ) dedicated to bringing about positive change for african - americans			1
ditto for tiny , grassroots dynamos like @entity33 's @entity32 , led by @entity34			2
you know who got it dead , dead wrong ? as much as it pains me to say it : far too many of our old - school civil rights organizations			1
since the first days of the @entity7 , one principle has been in place			2
put simply , it is that " owning the pipes " does not give you license to mess with what flows through them			0
internet service providers ( @entity53 ) can charge a fee to provide internet access			0
but they can not block or censor content they do not like , or charge for a fast lane , or relegate companies that do not pay up to slow @entity7 speeds that could frustrate customers			0
all the @entity0 did this week was keep that principle in place			0
they made sure the @entity7 will work the same way the phones do -- a call to the small business down the street does not sound worse or cost more than one to a big chain store			0
isps like @entity73 and @entity74 stood to make a killing from blocking this change			1
but what is shocking is that some trusted civil rights organizations -- including the @entity79 , @entity19 , and @entity80 -- actively helped the @entity53 make their case			1
worst of all , it was a completely avoidable error			0
they should have known that the argument that large @entity53 would expand access to under - served communities if they enjoyed higher profit margins was out of line with history and common sense			2
it was essentially " trickle - down dial - up , " and you would not expect civil rights leadership to fall for it			1
they should have been paying attention when the @entity53 told investors that a decision in favor of net neutrality would not cause these companies to rethink their broadband investments , while telling the @entity0 the exact opposite			1
in most black households -- in most households of any color -- that is called lying			2
and most importantly , they should have realized that african - americans need internet freedom to preserve our political voices , and foster a generation of young , black entrepreneurs taking on entrenched businesses			0
as a co-founder of # @entity118 , an initiative to help train 100,000 young people from low - opportunity communities for careers in coding , i have met amazing young people who have the smarts and the creativity			2
on a level playing field , they can compete with anyone			0
but if they must pay extortionist fees while the websites of competitors run much faster ? if that happens , we all suffer			0
black leaders and @entity139 companies and churches and @entity26 understood this			0
but the civil rights groups that persisted in citing telecom talking points ? i love them , but they have a little bit of egg on their face today			1
the one hope is that it is not too late			0
republicans and @entity53 have given no indication that they will stop fighting or cease seeking to relitigate this battle			0
they will undoubtedly be eager to use civil rights groups as cover			1
in other words , some of the legacy civil rights groups got it wrong			1
but it is not too late for them to get on the right side of history .			0

*traditional* civil rights groups like @entity19 *backed* isps in opposing net neutrality
@entity172 : the groups blew it , net neutrality is good for communities of color
