@entity0 -- the @entity2 ruled on tuesday federal regulators have the authority to clamp down on the broadcast tv networks that air isolated cases of profanity , known as " fleeting expletives			1
" the @entity2 ruled federal regulators can stop tv networks from airing profanity			1
the 5 - 4 vote was a victory for @entity16 - era officials who pushed fines and sanctions when racy images and language reached the airwaves			1
controversial words have been aired in scripted and unscripted instances on all the major over-the - air networks in the past six years -- dating back to when the @entity25 began considering a stronger , no - tolerance policy			1
" it suffices the new policy is permissible under the statute , there are good reasons for it , and the agency believes it to be better , " said justice @entity27 , writing for the conservative majority			2
the high court , however , refused to decide whether the commission 's policy violates the @entity40 guarantee of free speech , only the agency 's enforcement power			2
the justices ordered the free - speech aspect to be reviewed again by a federal appeals court			1
@entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 were parties in the case			0
a federal appeals court in @entity53 had ruled in their favor , calling the commission 's policy " arbitrary and capricious			1
" the commission then appealed to the @entity2 , seeking restoration of its power to penalize the networks airing " indecent " speech , even if it is broadcast only one time , and even if it does not describe a specific sex act			1
the high court agreed to some extent			0
" even when used as an expletive , the f - word 's power to insult and offend derives from its sexual meaning , " wrote @entity27			1
such language is heard with greater , albeit varying frequency on cable television , the @entity72 , and satellite radio , which do not use public airwaves			0
but the federal government is charged with responding to viewer complaints when " indecent " language reaches broadcast television and radio , which is subject to greater regulation			2
that is especially relevant during daytime and early evening hours , when larger numbers of families and younger viewers may be watching			2
the @entity25 's acting chairman , @entity87 , called tuesday 's ruling a " a big win for @entity90 's families			1
" the commission formally reversed its policy in march 2004 to declare even a single use of an expletive could be illegal			0
the changes became known as the " @entity96 , " for singer @entity98 's 2003 acceptance speech at the awards show on @entity49 , where he uttered the phrase " really , really , f --- ing brilliant			2
" the commission specifically cited celebrities @entity104 and @entity105 for potty - mouth language in the 2002 and 2003 @entity107 , which aired on @entity50			2
@entity112 , in an apparent scripted moment said , " have you ever tried to get cow s -- t out of a @entity111 purse ? it 's not so f --- ing simple			0
" the complaint against @entity47 involved " @entity116 , " a now - canceled scripted police drama , and the @entity48 ' complaint involved " @entity119 , " a news and interview program			0
enforcement of the law had been put on hold while the case was being argued			0
in dissent , justice @entity126 said " customs of speech " and context made the @entity25 's position unworkable			1
" as any golfer who has watched his partner shank a short approach knows , it would be absurd to accept the suggestion that the resultant four - letter word uttered on the golf course describes sex or excrement and is therefore indecent , " he wrote			0
" but that is the absurdity the @entity25 has embraced in its new approach to indecency			2
" and @entity126 wondered why the agency was going after words that he said had a " tenuous relationship " to sex and bodily functions , while at the same time prime - time commercials " frequently ask viewers whether they , too , are battling erectile dysfunction or are having trouble going to the bathroom			0
" justice @entity155 made clear how she viewed the broader free speech questions the high court may be forced to confront in coming years			0
" there is no way to hide the long shadow the @entity40 casts over what the commission has done , " she wrote			0
the @entity2 first ventured into the broadcast speech debate in 1978 , when it ruled as indecent a monologue by comedian @entity166 on society 's taboo surrounding " seven dirty words			1
" the bit had received some radio airplay			0
@entity126 , 89 , was the author of that opinion			0
justice @entity173 sided with his fellow conservatives on the narrow question presented to the court , but noted the changing landscape of television since @entity126 ' 31 - year - old ruling			1
he said that and other high court precedents " were unconvincing when they were issued , and the passage of time has only increased doubt regarding their continued validity			0
" he questioned the communication commission 's underlying authority as a " deep intrusion into the @entity40 rights of broadcasters			1
" and he noted the four networks no longer have a virtual monopoly on television content			0
" for most consumers , traditional broadcast media programming is now bundled with cable or satellite services , " he said , but the @entity25 's authority extends only to over-the - air television and radio content			1
conservative and family groups called tuesday 's ruling an " incredible victory			2
" " we implore the broadcast networks to abide by today 's court 's ruling rather than to pursue a path of attempted obstruction with countless legal maneuverings , " said @entity205 , president of the @entity206 , which monitors content on the airwaves			2
" and we encourage the @entity25 to use today 's opinion to break the indecency complaint logjam , and rule on the merits of the tens of thousands of indecency complaints currently awaiting review at the commission			1
" there was no immediate reaction from the broadcast networks , but groups representing the artistic and creative community expressed displeasure			0
ireport.com : share your thoughts on indecency on television " today 's decision is extremely disappointing , " said @entity233 , head of the @entity234			1
" we remain hopeful that the @entity25 's restrictive policies will ultimately be declared unconstitutional , but there will be several more years of uncertainty , and impaired artistic expression , while the lower courts address the @entity40 issues which the court chose not to confront today			1
" @entity244 -- the parent company of @entity1 -- filed a friend of the court brief supporting the networks fined by the communications commission			0
the company is part owner of the @entity252 broadcast network , and operates several cable networks			0
the case is @entity25 v. @entity255 ( 07 - 582 ) .			1
