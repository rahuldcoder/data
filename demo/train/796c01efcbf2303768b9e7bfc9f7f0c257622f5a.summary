@entity0 -- as @entity0 wraps up its prêt - à - porter shows for the @entity4 collection , young designers from across the globe are hoping to make it up one more rung of a desperately steep ladder			1
tradition , quality materials , creativity and global exposure make @entity0 the ultimate and most desired platform for young and established designers alike			1
international buyers and the press tend to stay in the city longer than in @entity19 or @entity20 and have time to visit the showrooms and recent platforms that have been created to showcase young designers , such as @entity25 , @entity26 or @entity27			1
acknowledging how little help young designers are afforded , several important prizes with varying degrees of funding have been created within the industry , the most recent and most generous being the @entity32 and prizes for young fashion school graduates			1
others include the @entity37 fashion award , and the @entity38 ( @entity38 )			1
still , it takes a combination of artistry , an awareness of the business , psychological and physical resilience to survive the challenging obstacle course to @entity0			1
most of all , say designers , it takes passion			1
@entity49 " you have to stay passionate , " said @entity49 , a young @entity50 designer who graduated from the @entity53 - based @entity52 school of visual arts in 2010			1
" i was ready for the [ grueling ] lifestyle because school was so difficult that i did n't have a life outside of fashion then either			1
" hired 15 months ago by @entity61 , the 26 - year old said that her selection as a finalist in the @entity64 in @entity65 helped her budding career immeasurably			1
with leading fashion companies sponsoring the festival each year , and jury members including designers @entity70 and @entity72 , and former @entity74 fashion journalist @entity73 , @entity65 has enormous cachet and " accelerates the process , " said @entity49 , who presented a collection in synthetic materials with touches of leopard spots and fringes in 2011			1
" but i did n't get here right away — i worked at @entity83 , a microstructure in @entity0 , and then at @entity85			1
it 's important to understand how things work , both in smaller structures where you work with financial constraints and you have to manage everything , and then in larger luxury structures where money is not a problem			0
" what is critical , said @entity49 , is to find work immediately after graduation : " it 's a field where things move very fast and it gets harder and harder when you do n't begin right away			0
" @entity102 32 - year - old glove maker @entity103 is from southern @entity104 , studied in the @entity105 and has been based in @entity0 since 2010 , launching her own brand , @entity107 , 18 months ago			1
her sculptural gloves in materials such as leather from @entity114 salmon , hand - painted python or stingray have been included in haute couture and prêt - à - porter shows and this is her second year exhibiting independently at the @entity27 salon			2
at the @entity118 in @entity119 she specialized in textiles and accessories , and developed the idea of working on gloves			0
during an internship with a luxury textile house in @entity0 , she came across a brochure from the federation of glove factories			1
after writing to every company in the brochure , @entity102 found one that helped her produce her final project at school			0
in 2007 she was selected as a " talent " in the its competition , and was introduced to the @entity138 glove maker , @entity139 , who commissioned a collection from her just before the financial crisis			2
@entity102 slowly made her way towards @entity0 , " which gives you a feeling of being close to inspiration , " as well as being in a country with a heritage of glove making where gloves are being rediscovered as an accessory			1
after creating gloves for various designers , @entity102 decided to strike out on her own			2
her strategy is to grow slowly , so for example she manages her own pr for the moment , lending her gloves to young photographers in exchange for photographs			2
she works mostly with leather from @entity163 and @entity138 and has her gloves made in a factory in @entity166 , which will work with small orders			0
because she does everything herself , " from design , book - keeping , production , sales , @entity156 , trade fairs , material research etc. in the end i only have maybe 15 % time for design during the whole year			2
i am lucky that i am both very sociable and was very good at mathematics as a student			0
" @entity181 although @entity182 - based jewelry designer @entity181 has been working in luxury fashion since 1990 , she launched her own brand in 2012 , working in collaboration with two @entity187 - based designers in a collective			1
she had been thinking about setting up on her own for a while , and had a number of independent clients for whom she made one - off creations , but was so busy that she kept putting it off			2
while working at @entity194 she met the two designers with whom she set up the collective because " it 's not easy to work alone			2
we each have our own distinctive brand , but we put our strengths together			0
we pick a theme and then interpret it in our own way			0
" @entity181 combines semi-precious stones with wood , brass , resin and enamel to make her innovative jewelry , often inspired by nature			2
with her own brand now , she says she has learned more in two years than during her entire time working for fashion houses			0
" you need to have a scope of 360 degrees , you have to control everything — marketing , pr , pricing , all of a sudden you have be an accountant as well			0
" salons like @entity27 are a good way to meet people , says @entity181 , who will rent a space there for her summer collection			0
" they organize parties and you can meet other designers			0
we can share our struggles with each other , which is reassuring since everyone puts so much passion and love into what they are doing and yet it 's easy to have doubts			0
it 's really a psychological and financial rollercoaster			0
you have to have energy and believe in yourself			0
