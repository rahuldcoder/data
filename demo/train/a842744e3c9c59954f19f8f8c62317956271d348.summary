-- @entity1 , or the " @entity2 " as he has been dubbed , is making his final preparations for the @entity4 in @entity5			1
a skier preparing to take part in the @entity8 at this point in the calendar is not the most sensational news , until it is understood the 31 - year - old grew up in @entity13 , @entity14 ( where the annual average temperature is around 79 degrees @entity16 ) and learnt to ski only six years ago on a dry slope			1
@entity1 hopes his remarkable and unconventional rise to prominence -- he achieved the strict qualifying criteria set by the world governing body of his sport from his training base at an artificial snow dome in @entity26 , @entity27 , where he was a former employee -- can act as inspiration to his countrymen			2
" the response that i get from emails and phone calls , that more people are going to come into snow sports , that 's what i 'm hoping to achieve and 10 years from now @entity14 should have a ski racer who is 10 times better than me , " he told @entity0			1
the " @entity2 " first sprung to prominence after announcing his intention to qualify and compete in the downhill at the @entity41 in 2006 , despite only having taken up the sport in 2003			2
" it took 30 minutes for me to be able to just go in a straight line , slow myself down and stop , and the instructor who was my friend , told me : ' you know something , just go and train yourself now , just carry on			0
' and that 's when i started falling down , " he said			0
after becoming hooked on downhill and pleased with his natural ability he set about trying to qualify -- a feat that involved traveling around the world			0
he narrowly missed qualifying for the @entity56 - based games but came back stronger to insure his place in @entity58 , an achievement the 34 - year - old is exceptionally proud of			1
" i think it was like sending a @entity14 to the moon , [ but ] apart from it being really cool -- i still wake up and still think to myself -- this is going to be really tough , people are going to be watching you -- you ca n't just go to the @entity4 and just have fun , " he added			1
the father of two will compete in two events , the giant slalom and slalom , and is anxious not to be a figure of fun like @entity77 ski - jumper @entity75 , who notoriously captured the headlines at the 1988 @entity4 in @entity79			1
he prefers to take his cue from the @entity82 bob sleigh team who also competed in @entity79 and inspired the popular film " @entity85 "			0
" the @entity82 bob sleigh team did actually try really hard to have really fast push off times , really moving down the course -- not all the factors were right for them -- and they crashed -- if they did n't crash , they would have done a really good time , " he said			0
" so i love being compared to @entity85 but not @entity90 " or @entity91 " ( swimmer from @entity93 ) because to me , sports is a serious thing			0
" if you want to be a sportsman , be a sportsman			0
if you want to have fun then do sports for leisure			0
do n't take the seriousness of sport and make a mockery of it			0
" there is another serious point to the @entity14 's participation , his efforts on behalf of the charity which attempts to protect the rare animal from which he gleans his nickname			1
" i 'm working with the @entity117 , they protect the endangered snow leopard , " he said			1
" i 'm also working with @entity119 which is a registered charity in @entity77 , taking kids in tough areas out of @entity122 and out to the @entity123 , showing them a different side to life			2
" @entity1 's ambition is to return with his family , who live in @entity26 , to @entity14 and to open a dry ski slope			1
in the meantime , his attentions are fully on next month where he will pit his skills against the likes of @entity133 and @entity134			0
" i do n't just want to get down , but ski well and not come at the bottom of the table , " he said .			2

@entity4 appearance comes only six years after first ski run on a dry slope
dream of taking part is similar to sending a @entity14 " to the moon " says @entity1
34 - year - old supports a charity which attempts to protect the rare snow leopard
