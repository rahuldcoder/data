and her powerful associates , including president @entity8 himself ( @entity9 )			1
before " @entity13 's " blu - ray / dvd hits stores tomorrow , @entity10 shared with @entity0 her favorite moments from the @entity17 drama , discussed her electrifying chemistry with @entity9 , and even dished on season 2			1
though @entity10 claimed to love the " dirty work of acting , " she clearly prefers watching co-star @entity23 " torture " another actor rather than the steamy scene she shared with @entity9			1
" that stuff is not fun , at all , " she said			2
" those are private moments			2
but that 's what acting is -- it 's about ... having the courage to allow your audience into the private moments of your characters ' lives			2
" another kind of torture ? not letting herself be paralyzed by the knowledge the man with whom she 's steaming up the small screen is happily married			2
it 's just an occupational hazard , though : " anybody who cares about somebody who has to do scenes like that [ has to be ] really compassionate			0
" she adds , " @entity9 's very in love with his wife and his daughters , who i 've met			0
it 's all good ! " never fear , @entity57 fans ! @entity6 assured , " i know @entity9 's still going to be around " when the show resumes filming in july			1
but that does n't mean all @entity62 's relationships are secure			0
how will @entity62 react when she learns what peppy underling @entity63 has been hiding ? " a lot of that depends on who she is , " said @entity6			1
" i do n't think @entity62 makes decisions on how to treat people or how to navigate a situation blindly			0
she really takes into account the circumstance at hand			0
" " scandal " season 1 comes out on @entity77 tomorrow			1
