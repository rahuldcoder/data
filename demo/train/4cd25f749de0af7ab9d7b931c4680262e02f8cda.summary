-- @entity4 away from the somber ceremony on a tarmac where coffins containing the remains of victims of @entity10 were returned , dozens of forensic scientists at a military base in the @entity3 were preparing for the grim task of identifying the remains			1
in all , 298 passengers and crew -- among them dozens of children -- were killed when the packed @entity18 @entity17 777 they were on crashed in eastern @entity19 last thursday			1
all of the bodies and body parts recovered from the crash site will eventually be brought to @entity23 , @entity3 , where a team of experts from the @entity3 national forensics unit ( @entity26 ) will do everything they can to return the dead to their loved ones			1
" you do n't know which nationality each body is , " explains @entity30 of @entity26			0
" so we try to identify all the bodies			1
we are in contact with the other countries to combine efforts to identify the bodies			1
" the @entity26 has experience of other mass disasters , having worked on the 2004 @entity43 tsunami , the crash of @entity45 in @entity46 in 2010 and other incidents in the @entity3			1
@entity48 says great care has and will continue to be taken over the bodies , out of respect for the victims and to avoid any further distress to their families			1
forensics specialist : ' it must be very precise ' it is painstaking work , @entity30 says : " there are lot of bodies and body parts coming our way			2
[ everything ] must be examined			0
... it must be very precise			0
you must make sure you do n't give the wrong body to the wrong family			0
" the team 's work began days ago on the @entity19 field near the @entity75 border where @entity10 's journey from @entity77 to @entity78 came to a premature end			1
forensic genetics expert @entity80 of @entity82 says some identifications will be relatively simple			0
" it sounds as if they have perhaps 200 body bags with identifiable bodies or parts of bodies in , " she says			2
" and while they have been at the site for some time , i would expect that it will be possible to get good dna profiles from most of those			1
" in some cases , working out who is who may be even easier than that -- if a victim has a distinctive scar or clothing , or even a wallet or passport in a pocket			0
dental records can also be used to identify those who are not immediately recognizable			1
if @entity109 is needed , it is usually taken from an area of deep muscle			0
@entity109 may also be used			0
in both cases , the experts will then need to compare the dna taken from the victim with a relative			1
search for @entity109 matches but @entity80 says the fact so many families died on @entity120 may complicate the process			1
" where you have lots of family members traveling together , you may have to rely on @entity109 matches to more distant relatives , " she explains			0
" once you get beyond the immediate family , beyond grandparents or aunts and uncles , it becomes more difficult			0
" in those cases , scientists may have to rely on alternative comparisons , matching dna from the remains to that found on toothbrushes or clothing owned by the dead person			1
@entity48 says work has already begun to collect details and dna matches for those on board the plane , with dozens of detectives interviewing family members			1
" we have been working with the families of the victims			1
from them , we ask [ for ] a description of the victim , and we take dna , look at the dental records and take fingerprints , " he told @entity0 , adding that the process of talking to relatives can take a long time			1
" you try to get as much information during your first visit			0
you do n't want to forget some questions			0
it is very painful to have to get back to families to ask [ more ] questions			1
" " every bit of information you get from a relative needs to be collected very carefully			2
also you need to take records from the bodies			2
it is a delicate procedure for example , [ to ] take dental records or @entity109			1
" @entity80 helped to identify the victims of @entity177 , which crashed into the @entity178 on its way from @entity180 to @entity181 in 2009 , leaving 152 dead			2
she says not every victim will be easy to put a name to : cases where the force of a blast or fire have damaged the remains can be complex			2
and she says that while experts do have the passenger manifest , some cases may never be fully resolved			2
but she hopes knowing , at least , that everything possible has been done , and that the remains were handled with great care will offer some solace			2
" the longer it goes on , the more difficult it can be			0
... if someone is not found , or a body part is never identified , but it is dealt with in a sensitive way , the families know someone has gone to the effort , someone has tried their best			0
" for the experts at @entity23 , the next weeks and months will be busy and difficult			0
@entity48 says the work can be emotional , but everyone is united by their common aim			0
" we have the drive to give the bodies back to the families , " he says			1
" every case is unique , [ but ] you want to get the victim back			0
the drive stays the same			0
" @entity80 agrees : " it 's a tough job , but a good job			0
" it is always grim , but we do it with the knowledge that we are helping someone else : the family want to be able to put it to bed , and we want to give them some peace			0
" @entity10 tributes in @entity231 : ' forgive us ' mother regrets hot heeding son 's fears @entity0 's @entity235 and @entity236 contributed to this report .			2

the remains of victims of @entity10 have been flown back to the @entity3
dozens of bodies collected from the crash site have been taken to @entity245 in the @entity19
@entity3 experts will use dna , dental records and fingerprints to identify the victims
the identification process can be *lengthy* but is aimed at giving families *closure*
