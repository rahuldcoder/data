in recent weeks , @entity0 has been distributed to its first group of beta testers outside @entity3 and in the real world			1
as the pool of new smart - glass wearers grows , they are feeling out the etiquette of using the new technology			1
in more jaded settings , people wearing @entity0 are casually ignored ; their recent life choice to wear a piece of computing hardware wrapped around the front of their faces does n't register as unusual			1
the reactions increase , though , the farther away they go from the safety zones of the @entity3 campus , @entity20 and , last week , the @entity21 in downtown @entity22 , where the @entity24 conference was being held			0
the first reaction from strangers is usually excitement			2
when the doors opened on a crowded hotel elevator , @entity29 attendee @entity28 heard a cry of " he has @entity0 ! come in ! come in ! " @entity28 declined and took the next lift down , only to find the excited guests waiting for him in the lobby , ready with questions			1
@entity38 to get big , personal redesign because it is still so new and somewhat rare , @entity0 is an excellent conversation starter			1
when not being accosted by curious strangers , wearers can use the eyewear to break the ice			1
a friend of @entity28 's had luck wearing his to a bar and meeting new people			2
after the regular barrage of questions ( how does it work ? are you using it now ? ) many strangers ask to try on the $ 1,500 piece of hardware			2
the answer is typically no , and some owners will cite @entity3 's terms prohibiting the lending of @entity0 as an excuse			1
sometimes , the conversations are behind the wearer 's back , and they 're not always " @entity65 " and " @entity66			0
" glass owners reported hearing people whisper after they passed by			2
but snickers and sneering are common with any new , really expensive technology			0
the cost of the devices makes them an easy target ; wearing them is still interpreted as a geeky status symbol			0
" i think there 's definitely a @entity81 - not thing , especially in @entity22			0
there 's a cachet to it , " said @entity82 , founder of @entity83 , a company developing a @entity0 app for remembering people and places			1
@entity3 says you 'll know when @entity0 is sketchy after the initial shock of seeing @entity0 in the wild wears off , there are the new and awkward aspects of conversation with someone wearing the tiny screen			1
when having a casual chat with someone wearing @entity0 , it can take effort to not stare directly at the shiny gadget instead of into the person 's eyes			2
the finger gesture that people use to dismiss the notifications can be distracting , as can the flash of light on the @entity0 itself			1
" there 's definitely an interesting occurrence when the screen lights up with a notification , " @entity82 said			0
" i 've asked people , ' did you just take a picture ? ' " it 's difficult for the other person to actually see what 's on the screen , but the first question has , in fact , become one of paranoia			2
google+ : one @entity3 tool to bind them all @entity28 dismisses privacy worries , pointing out that his battery would die after just three minutes of video recording anyway			0
@entity82 says people should be a more concerned about government surveillance cameras , which he considers less obvious than a person standing in front of you saying , " ok , @entity0 , take a picture			1
" just to be polite , some @entity0 wearers have started pushing the devices up onto their heads like sunglasses when having conversations			1
after the shock and paranoia subside , there is the annoyance			0
can a person really be engaged in a conversation if there are e-mails in the corner of their eye ? advocates for the technology argue that having a screen within eye 's reach could actually improve manners in the digital age			0
people are already habitually checking smartphones that beep and flash regularly with notifications			0
instead of reaching for a phone , which can absorb a person 's full attention , @entity0 brings the notifications directly into the line of sight			2
the camera feature could help fix the problem of people experiencing big moments , such as concerts or a child 's birthday party , through their smartphone screens			0
instead of taking out a phone , they can keep their eyes on the scene and take a picture at the same time			0
" you 're just living your life ; you 're not living through a viewfinder , " @entity28 said .			0

early @entity0 wearers are figuring out the etiquette of a face - *mounted* screen
many owners are *constant*ly *fielding* excited or paranoid questions from strangers
the *flickering* screen and *constant* head - touching can be distracting during conversations
some people have started pushing their @entity0 onto their head when talking
