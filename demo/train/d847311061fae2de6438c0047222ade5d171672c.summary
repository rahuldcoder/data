@entity0 is @entity2 's historical heart , the former capital and home to 1,600 temples			1
from the entertainment district of @entity9 , where geishas can be spotted scurrying along narrow cobbled lanes , to the cherry tree - lined @entity12 , some parts of the city seem timeless			2
but among the striking sights of ancient @entity0 sit less obtrusive buildings that capture the spirit of the city and remain a link between the past and the present			1
they are " machiya " , traditional wooden townhouses			1
their narrow frontage gives way to deep interiors , so long and thin that they became known as " a bed for an eel " ( " unagi no nedoko , " in @entity2 )			2
@entity32 lives in a machiya in @entity0 that has been in her family for 13 generations			1
" this house is rare and very traditional and therefore our identity as @entity2 has been nurtured in this house , " she says			1
" when i think about that , i would say this is the most amazing part of this house and this is what i love the most about it			0
" that enduring love of old homes is not universal in @entity2			2
there is more financial incentive to destroy rather than preserve , as the structure of a home has very little market value after a few decades , and machiya have suffered from demolition and redevelopment			1
around 80 % of demolished machiya in the city are replaced by modern houses and high - rise buildings , according to the @entity60 , while the majority of those that remain have suffered some loss to their original facades			1
however some are focusing on preserving what remains of the city 's old townhouses and believes that they should endure modern development			2
" this one housing type has been developing over 1,200 years , continuously adapting to the different lifestyles , adapting and changing , " says @entity72 designer @entity71 who over a decade has renovated over 30 machiya			0
the challenges of renovation are huge			0
@entity78 first had to learn from carpenters and craftsmen the special skills needed to build machiya before he could draw up practical renovation plans			0
but rather than build museums to a former way of life , @entity71 is keen to create a fusion between the old and new			0
" that balance is very important , " he says			0
" and that 's the part that scares people ( when it comes to renovations )			0
" " there is a great satisfaction in taking something that was going to be thrown away and creating something that people admire , something that people appreciate			0
" there is an unbelievable amount of culture in these houses			0
" @entity32 uses a modern analogy : we view our lives like software , something forever changing then this traditional architecture is the hardware , the very structure that gives @entity2 life its foundation .			1
