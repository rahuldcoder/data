-- with all the scary stuff happening in the world -- @entity3 , @entity4 , take your pick -- it would n't be surprising if audiences steered clear of horror			1
but in fact , they 're doing just the opposite			2
two of the most popular tv premieres in october were in the horror genre -- " @entity16 " and " @entity17 , " to be exact -- and one of those premieres rivaled the biggest comedy on tv			1
( that premiere was the season 5 start of " @entity16 , " to no one 's surprise , and it was right behind the viewership for the fall premiere of @entity29 ' " @entity28			1
" ) and the list of horror successes could go on			1
so what 's behind our bloody fascination ? there are a few theories			2
for one , the genre is an excellent antidote to boredom			1
it 's obvious that the first thing viewers are looking for is " enjoyment of thrill , " said @entity44 , a @entity45 professor of media and psychology			2
watching a show in which your favorite character 's survival is far from guaranteed can bring about anxiety , she says , but that 's also part of the fun			2
" in a lot of horror films , the beloved protagonist ultimately gets away , if only for that particular episode or that particular movie in a series , " @entity59 said			1
" the anxiety we feel when we 're watching the show is palpable , ( and ) when that protagonist escapes , even by only a hair , then that ( anxiety ) feeds into our joy at this person 's survival			2
so we do n't feel a little bit happy , we feel really happy			2
it 's like watching a close sporting event ; it 's a lot more thrilling if your team wins after a really close game than after a landslide			2
" and what if we 're feeling anxious before we even sit down to watch a show ? something that 's resonated with " @entity16 " executive producer @entity81 is @entity85 's idea that zombies are a lot like email : " you kill one , and it 's going to draw two more in its place , " @entity81 said			1
" i can work on my email all day , and at the end of the day , i might have more emails than i had when i started			0
... you get this looming sense of dread that despite however hard you work , that it 's only going to make more work for yourself			0
ultimately , you 're forced to rethink the way in which you live your life , " he continued , not unlike one would have to if faced with a zombie apocalypse			0
" i say that kind of sarcastically , but it also has real resonance with me , " @entity81 said			0
" when my dad came home from work as a kid , he was done			0
unless his office was on fire , no one was calling him			0
there was no email ; no one expected you to respond			0
technology has put us in a state where we 're constantly reachable , which is great if you 're looking to hook up or communicate , but the idea that you 're constantly available leads people to expect you to constantly respond , and i think that leads to a heightened state of anxiety			0
whether you want to call it globalization and economic fears coming off the economic collapse a few years back , i think we 're looking at this situation where people have ... this real sense of unease			0
" if that 's the case , one could imagine that would make that payoff @entity59 talks about even greater			0
another part of it , says horror disciple and " @entity139 " showrunner @entity138 , is that the genre lends itself well to a communal experience			1
" at the movies , part of the fun is going and sitting with the crowd and jumping in unison and hearing other people as frightened as you are and finding safety in collective fright , " @entity138 pointed out			0
translate that experience to tv , especially in the era of social media , and watching a series that has a few jump scares , tension and " @entity159 " moments can make you feel like you 're part of a massive viewing collective , even if you 're the only one in front of the screen			0
it helps , too , that in horror , " the stakes are as high as they get , " @entity138 added			1
" it 's life and death			0
" the stakes were also pretty high for networks to air horror shows before series like " @entity16 " and " @entity17 " proved to be audience magnets			1
yet this current captivation with horror is n't just about scares and thrills			1
( and , it should go without saying , it 's far from the first time we 've had some great horror concepts on tv			1
) what the latest wave of genre - inspired series has been able to do is tap into the classic material in a fresh way and reimagine the methods for telling horror on tv			1
" when you talk about horror , often people think about the gore , the gross - outs , the jump - scares and the tension , and we have those , " @entity81 said			1
" but i do n't think people stay for that			0
it gives you those great moments where you reach over to the other person sitting next to you on the couch and you have that ( shocked ) reaction , but the reason why you go back is because you care about what happens to the character			0
" @entity205 realized the appetite for horror shows when it took a chance on " @entity17 " in 2011 , the network 's first foray into the genre			1
" having a great concept and having @entity218 's execution on that concept made us feel confident about it , " said @entity213 , the president of original programming for @entity205 and @entity215			0
" i do n't think we ever thought it would be the hit that is ; the show 's huge now , and it 's grown over the years			0
it took a little bit of getting used to for audiences , but once they caught on , they became enamored with it			0
" that adoration opened the door for @entity233 's gruesome vampire saga " @entity234 " and , according to @entity138 , for shows like his own " @entity139			1
" " i do n't think @entity236 would have rolled the dice on ' @entity139 ' if it were n't for the successes of ' @entity16 ' and ' @entity17 , ' where they thought , ok , let 's try our own brand of horror , which is different from those two but still in the same trough , " the showrunner said			1
" as with any sort of pioneering show , it just takes one to ... expose the audience to the quality of horror storytelling			1
" @entity236 is n't the only network eyeing horror ; @entity252 just added an adaptation of the 1996 slasher " @entity255 " to its 2015 roster			1
but thankfully , instead of getting 12 " @entity258 , " we got the " @entity259 " - inspired " @entity260 " on @entity261 ; " @entity262 " on @entity263 ; " @entity264 " on @entity265 ; and " @entity139 , " an elegant but deadly psychological thriller that 's amassed a rabid following			0
" horror films have been one of the earliest staples of cinematic storytelling ... so it 's been around as long as cinema has been around			2
all of those things have been in our vocabulary , " @entity138 said			0
now , " all those classic tropes of genre that some would argue are too tired or too stale " are being given " fresh blood for a new audience , and really reinvigorating our taste			2
