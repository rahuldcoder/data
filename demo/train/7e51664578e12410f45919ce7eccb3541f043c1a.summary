-- more than 50,000 people in 2011 were arrested in @entity2 for possessing small amounts of marijuana -- the majority of whom were black and @entity7 -- at a considerable judicial and financial cost			1
@entity2 spends about $ 75 million every year on arresting people for recreational marijuana possession			1
but what many people do n't know is that the state decriminalized this offense more than 30 years ago , making private possession of less than 25 grams of marijuana a violation punishable by a $ 100 fine			2
possession of the same amount in public view remains a criminal misdemeanor			1
despite this change in law , arrests for small quantities of marijuana over the last decade have skyrocketed , with more than 400,000 people arrested and unceremoniously run through the criminal justice system			1
marijuana possession is now the no. 1 arrest category in @entity2			1
why is this happening ? each year , hundreds of thousands of people in @entity2 are stopped , questioned , frisked and searched , often without justification , under the " stop and frisk " policy			1
the vast majority of these people live in communities of color , and almost 90 % are immediately released without arrest or even a summons			2
often , however , the police approach young people and instruct them to empty their pockets immediately and show the officers anything they have			1
people who have a small quantity of marijuana in their pockets take it out and hold it up			1
the marijuana is now in public view			1
thousands of people are then arrested and charged with misdemeanor possession , punishable by up to three months in jail and a $ 500 fine			2
given the change of law in 1977 , had the marijuana remained in the person 's pocket , possession would not have been a crime at all			1
but in complying with a police officer 's request , otherwise noncriminal behavior is instantly transformed into an arrest and unceremonious journey through the criminal justice system			2
many view it as classic entrapment			0
a majority of these arrests happen only in certain neighborhoods			0
indeed , compounding the injustice is the fact that 85 % of the people arrested are black and @entity7			1
yet studies consistently show that younger and affluent whites use marijuana in equal if not greater numbers			0
the consequences of an arrest are severe , especially for young people of color who are already disproportionately subjected to criminal justice system intervention and incarceration			0
an arrest creates serious barriers to going to college or getting a job , and that person 's future may begin to spiral downward			0
the damage to police and community relations can not be overstated			0
another serious problem is that these needless and inappropriate arrests detract from arresting and prosecuting serious criminals			0
millions of dollars in law enforcement resources are wasted			0
thousands of lives are damaged with the contamination of having a criminal record			0
but @entity2 is prepared to take a significant step forward to solve this problem			2
with the leadership of gov. @entity112 , we are on the brink of finishing the job that the state legislature started in 1977			0
we want to reduce the classification of possession of small quantities of marijuana in plain view from a misdemeanor to a violation			1
the possession of small quantities of marijuana is either a crime or it is not			1
but it can not be criminal activity for one group of people and socially acceptable behavior for another when the dividing line is race			0
the connected and powerful -- including many in high political office -- have frequently admitted to smoking marijuana when they were young			0
we did n't unmercifully penalize them			0
we should stop needlessly criminalizing tens of thousands of our young people for doing the same thing			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity145 .			2

in 2011 , 50,000 mostly black and @entity7 people arrested in @entity2 for having a little pot
@entity145 : carrying a small amount is not a crime , but having it in public view is
@entity145 : police order people to empty pockets , and if they take out pot , it is now in public view
@entity145 says the marijuana penalty needs to be reduced and law changed
