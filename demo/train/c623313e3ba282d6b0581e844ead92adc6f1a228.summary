" it makes me feel like there 's no justice			0
" demonstrations also erupted in @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 , where they shut down one of the major roads downtown			1
@entity75 , 22 , a young protester in @entity71 , told @entity0 : it feels like we 're moving backwards , so if we have to march like it 's the ' 60s , we will			1
earlier in @entity80 , protesters marched and lay down in the middle of a street			1
" it 's happening in every city , every town			0
it 's happening here in @entity80 , " @entity86 told @entity0 affiliate @entity61			1
" police are racially profiling people			2
they are harassing people , " she said			0
" there is just no accountability and no justice for the victims			0
" the demonstrations raise the question : if the way we police in @entity102 is wrong , as many suggest , then what 's right ? that 's the problem police and communities now face in the wake of three high - profile investigations that , collectively , have sparked a national conversation around changing the status quo			1
in @entity112 , @entity113 , violence and chaos erupted after a different grand jury elected not to indict a white officer for killing a black teenager			1
a nearly two - year investigation by the @entity120 revealed a pattern of excessive force by police in @entity124			1
and in @entity3 , officials are still in the midst of grappling with what to do in the wake of @entity8 's death			1

even if it 's not illegal , the city 's police department patrol guide states its officers " will not use chokeholds , " which it defines as any action pressuring the throat or windpipe			2
" whenever it becomes necessary to take a violent or resisting subject into custody , responding officers should utilize appropriate tactics in a coordinated effort to overcome resistance , " the patrol guide says			0
once this investigation is finished , it 's possible that a negotiated settlement will be reached or that there will be a department trial			0
" if there 's a finding of guilt , a decision will be made as to an appropriate penalty or discipline for that , " said police commissioner @entity196 , who would decide on the punishment			2
@entity8 's family angry , calls for justice so who was @entity8 ? before his death at the age of 43 , he was a father of six , as well as a grandfather			1
he was also someone with a history of run - ins with the law , including 30 arrests			2
when police confronted him in july , they suspected that he was illegally selling untaxed cigarettes -- something for which he had previously been arrested			2
but his family , and its supporters , ca n't understand how anyone could think officers ' actions that day were justified			0
@entity8 's mother , @entity225 , wondered how the grand jury -- which was of mixed race and heard from dozens of police and civilian witnesses between september 29 and december 3 -- could decide there was n't " probable cause " for an indictment after seeing the widely distributed video			1
and his widow , @entity234 , was angry that " somebody that gets paid to do right did wrong " and was not held accountable for it			0

officers -- on the lookout for people trying to block traffic for long periods of time -- ended up arresting 83 people			2
@entity196 pointed out there was no violence , no vandalism , no looting			0
@entity8 's family wanted it that way , with father @entity271 telling a crowd outside the store where his son gasped in the chokehold , " we ai n't tearing up nothing			1

speaking specifically about the @entity8 case , @entity196 said he understood people 's anger over the scenes on the video , but that he also trusted the legal process and the grand jury 's judgment in spite of the images			1
" as much as we think video is the final determinant , it is not , " he said			0
the grand jury saw much more evidence and argument than the public or he have seen , he said			2
a judge ruled thursday against releasing some of the testimony and evidence presented to jurors , one day after the @entity54 district attorney filed a motion asking for such a release , given the public interest in the case			0

it sat for nine weeks and heard from a 50 witnesses , including civilians , officers and medical personnel			0
sixty exhibits were admitted into evidence , including four videos			0
@entity165 's police union defended his tackle , with @entity345 president @entity344 saying " it is clear that the officer 's intention was to do nothing more than take mr. @entity8 into custody as instructed and that he used the takedown technique that he learned in the academy when mr. @entity8 refused			1
