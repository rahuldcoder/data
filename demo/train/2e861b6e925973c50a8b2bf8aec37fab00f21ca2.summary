-- after four years and more than $ 100 million spent by the international community , the @entity1 rendered its first verdict monday			1
@entity4 , better known as @entity4 , was found guilty of war crimes and sentenced to serve up to 19 more years in prison in what was an open - and - shut case			1
from the start , @entity4 , a born - again @entity8 , fully admitted his leadership role in @entity12 's infamous @entity11 , a school - turned - torture center , where more than 14,000 people were killed			2
on this momentous occasion , i 'd like to step back by reflecting upon and give voice to one victim of the @entity1 : my late mother , @entity20			1
my mom passed away in october at the age of 73 in @entity23			2
when she was only 39 , she had managed to outwit the @entity1 and the @entity25 communists by escaping @entity26 to @entity25 with five young children , including me			1
she did n't live to see this day , but no matter , for her justice would inevitably be rendered the @entity30 way			2
she decided long ago the @entity1 were @entity32 pestilence who would pay the price for their crimes , if not in this lifetime , then in their next life			1
she was an incredible woman			2
she grew up in an age and place when women were the property of men , and yet she sought independence			2
on her home was a sign " @entity47 " ( property of mrs. @entity47 )			2
she married my father in the 1960s and on april 17 , 1975 , we ended up in @entity54 province , where my father was made to work until he died			2
one day , the @entity1 chief told the village that @entity25 citizens would be allowed to return to @entity25			1
she decided to take a chance and claim to be @entity25			1
it was a dangerous gamble			2
if it turned out that she was wrong , she would certainly have been killed			2
people in the commune warned her it might be a trap			2
'' @entity66 , they 're lying , they 'll kill you when you go back there , '' they said			0
'' to stay is to die , to go is to die , so i might as well go , '' she told them			0
as she arrived in the camp on the @entity26 border with @entity25 , she discovered that she 'd given all the boys girls ' names and all the girls boys ' names			1
her spoken @entity25 was that bad			1
but because of the kindness of a stranger , mrs. @entity79 , who pointed this out to her and then tutored her for the next couple of days , her @entity25 improved so much that she passed the language test that the @entity1 and the @entity25 cadres gave her			1
remember , if she failed , we would all be dead			0
imagine the courage it took for her to stand there and pretend to be someone she was not : @entity25			1
on the day of the interview , she wrapped us in blankets and made us pretend to be sick so we would not be questioned			0
the @entity25 cadre asked her : '' sister what is your name ? '' she answered in her best @entity96 accent : '' my name is @entity99 , '' a name she 'd given herself			1
they kept asking whether my father , who had owned a small drugstore , had been a big shot			0
she stuck to her story			0
'' no , he was a trader , that 's all			2
'' read more about @entity108 and his family 's journey when at last she received permission to leave @entity26 , she was so happy			1
this chance to leave was like being reborn with all of her children			2
on the boat to @entity25 , she was given rice and canned milk for me , as the baby			1
without even warming it up , she fed it to me until i became bloated and sick			0
my sister @entity123 cried : '' i want noodles ! i want noodles ! '' @entity126 had no money , so she sold her last ring and bought a pot and some three - layered pork fat to make our first real meal in six months			2
it was her determination that allowed us to survive , for even after reaching @entity25 's @entity135 , we were not out of the woods			1
@entity25 authorities told us to find family or we 'd be taken to a collective farm , which was n't much better than living under the @entity1			1
as luck would have it , mom bumped into someone who knew her sister and brother - in - law , who lived in @entity96 ( @entity96 )			0
she asked that word be sent , and soon after , on a boat down the @entity135 , her brother - in - law came to the rescue			0
he bribed guards to let us out in the middle of the night and in january 1976 , we were finally safe			0
over the next two years , mom somehow managed to survive by her wits and the money another sister who lived in @entity23 sent her			0
the next challenge was how to get out of communist @entity25			1
without diplomatic relations , the @entity157 was impossible to reach after the @entity159 , but @entity160 was an option			1
getting to @entity160 in 1978 took a lot of work			1
for one thing , mom had no direct family there , and someone with the same last name had to be found and persuaded to sign papers claiming a family relationship			0
after signing the papers , they got lost in the mail			0
there again , a random person helped			0
a @entity160 forged signatures , cajoled and yelled at staff in a @entity160 government offices			1
he once demanded they reopen because , by his watch , it was n't yet closing time			0
in @entity160 , mom worked hard to sew fancy tablecloths and napkins with embroidered flowers			1
in 1985 , she packed up her bags again and took her three youngest kids ( @entity190 , @entity123 and i were minors ) to start a new life in the @entity157			1
she worked as a seamstress in the garment factories of @entity196 's @entity195 , making wedding gowns that had labels we 'd never heard of , much less could afford			1
she used those same skills to make @entity123 clothes that were just as good and custom - made			1
all through this time , she pressed us to study in school and to go on to college			0
she was not interested in a life of quick riches			0
cutting school short to work was out of the question			0
she believed in education , and for her , education was not only about making money , it was about learning how to think			1
all this was from a woman who had seven years of formal schooling			0
somehow , she did n't need any more to know that our responsibility was to get an education			2
@entity190 graduated from @entity219 and now works as a software engineer			0
@entity123 finished @entity221 as a pharmacist			0
i received my @entity225 phd and became a professor			0
the @entity227 says that if you save a life , you save the world			0
the @entity231 have another proverb : " when you save a life , you are responsible for that life			0
" my mom saved six lives from the @entity237 , and with 14 grandkids and counting , she has saved 20 lives to date			0
i say counting because two days ago , i learned that my wife is expecting our second child			0
thanks , mom , for helping to bring new hope into this world			0

she and her children were able to escape from @entity26 by posing as @entity25
