-- imagine this : floating in freezing water for 20 hours a day , over seven excruciating days , beneath a 90 - meter iceberg which may or may not collapse on you , crushing you to death			1
why would anybody to do this ? to surf a wave , of course			0
the man crazy -- or brave -- enough to dream up such a challenge , is @entity12			2
the same man who surfed the world 's biggest wave -- a 24 - meter monster -- off the coast of @entity18 in 2011			1
it would be too easy to describe the 45 - year - old @entity20 as an " adrenalin junkie			1
" instead , @entity12 's addiction to " the rush , " as he so frequently describes it , is so all - consuming it 's practically the life - giving blood pumping through his veins			1
it 's also the reason the father - of - three risks his life in one of the most dangerous , and jaw - droppingly breathtaking , extreme sports on the planet -- glacier surfing			1
glacial gladiator in 2007 , @entity12 became the first person to surf a glacier wave -- a wave created when a 75 - meter chunk of ice broke off from a massive glacier in @entity39			1
as the block of ice plummeted into the @entity43 , it created a two - meter - high wave which @entity12 surfed -- the first and probably only person ever to ride such a swell			1
" it was the closest i 've ever come to death , " said the man who has surfed nine - story waves on the most rugged coastlines in the world			2
" i was up to my neck in water , looking up at this 90 - meter tall glacier , waiting for the ice to break off and hoping that it 'll fall straight into the water -- because if it falls flat you 'll be squashed under it			1
" @entity12 spent a week camped out at the glacier , spending up to 20 hours a day in the freezing water , waiting for the ice to break off and give him the most exhilarating ride of his life			1
" i wanted to go home after the first day , " @entity12 admitted			2
" but it 's fun to be the first to do something			0
it 's a totally new experience -- no one can tell you what it feels like , what to expect			0
" tiny terror even as a child growing up in @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity12 was always testing the boundaries of danger			2
" my brothers said i was always the craziest , always pushing buttons , " he said			0
" when i was five - years - old i was jumping off two - story buildings			0
" when @entity12 was 11 years old his family moved to @entity86 , where he replaced his hobby of skateboarding with surfing -- " from the very first day , i fell in love with it , " he said			2
by 17 , he was competing in the prestigious @entity91 and for the next decades traveled the globe as part of the professional surfing circuit			0
" i really just want to get beautiful barrels , " he said			0
" you 're in your own world			0
it 's a place where time stands still , where all you can hear is your heart beat			0
" big wave hunter then in the 1990s came one of the most revolutionary developments since the sport began -- tow - surfing			1
for the first time , surfers could be towed out to the biggest waves in the world with a jet ski -- and @entity12 was quick to jump on board			1
but fear is something we create , " he said			0
" we create fear when we think about the future and what could happen -- i 'm in the moment			0
" watching @entity12 in action , a tiny speck skidding down the towering face of a nine - story wave , is enough to make your stomach drop			1
but he remains almost nonchalant			0
" if you look at the statistics , it 's a lot more dangerous to ride down a highway than a big wave , " he said			2
" if you do n't make the wave , the jet ski will come get you			0
in 2000 we started using life jackets , so as long as you can hold your breath under water for long enough , you 're ok			0
" record breaker it 's perhaps that practical attitude which has seen @entity12 smash surfing records			1
in 2011 he rode the biggest wave in the world -- a 24 - meter monster in @entity145 , @entity18			1
earlier this year he returned to the same spot to ride another huge wave , that may have been up to 30 meters high			2
" i 'm looking for the rush , " @entity12 said			2
" but lately i 've had a really hard time finding it			0
" when i surfed the glacial wave it was mind - bending , it was the heaviest rush			1
but since that day i 've found it difficult to get that rush in the ocean			2
it made me realize how comfortable i feel on big waves			0
" @entity12 's describes his obsession with that elusive rush as " like a monkey on my back			1
" though he chuckles as he adds : " i think the monkey 's starting to lose his grip			0
