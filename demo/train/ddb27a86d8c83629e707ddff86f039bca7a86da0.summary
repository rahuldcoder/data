-- @entity1 was instantly hooked the moment she received her first pair of @entity5 earrings as a gift for her 16th birthday			1
the dangling , leopard - print hearts became her go - to accessory for adding oomph to any outfit			2
now , amid news that 67 @entity5 retail stores in the @entity15 , @entity16 and the @entity17 are liquidating and closing for good , this " @entity20 " from @entity21 , @entity22 , is scrambling to acquire as much merchandise as she can			1
since the fashion house filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in april , @entity23 has driven to the nearest boutique in @entity27 , @entity28 , for loot from the brand 's high - end @entity30			1
" her styles combine the young and girly elements -- like bows , floral patterns , excessive use of hot pink , and sparkles -- with mature and sexy elements , like corsets , high platform heels , lace , fishnets and lipstick , " @entity23 said			0
at 18 , @entity23 embodies that " not a girl , not yet a woman " aesthetic at the heart of the designer 's look for decades			0
an icon of the " @entity53 " mentality , @entity5 is known for her bold and flirty apparel and accessories that incorporate just about every motif of feminine style imaginable , from tulle and silk to pastels and sequins			1
the brand itself is n't going away			2
the decision to shutter stores is part of a larger effort to focus on wholesale business , said a spokesman for @entity70 , which has owned the brand 's intellectual property rights since 2010			1
sales will continue until july or until a store runs out of stock			1
nor is @entity5 disappearing the industry scene			1
she will stay on as creative director of @entity5 and continue working on the brand 's less expensive line , which is sold in department stores and specialty boutiques across the country			1
she even attended the annual @entity85 awards on monday , suggesting that her days of cartwheeling down the runway are not quite over			0
yet , the prospect of her fading from the landscape provoked an outpouring of nostalgia from a generation of fans who connect moments in their lives with her designs			1
" i remember first seeing @entity5 's designs when i was a little girl in fashion magazines			1
thought she was so cool and looked like she was having so much fun , surrounded by all that color & whimsey ! " a fan wrote on @entity5 's @entity103 page			1
" she inspired me to become a jewelry designer , really gon na miss her , but i 'm sure she wo n't just be sitting around , doing nothing , with all that energy & imagination ! best of luck to you & thanks ! " there 's a lot of sentimental longing connected with her designs , said @entity119 , executive editor of fashion and style blog , @entity122			0
for a lot of people , a @entity5 was their first fancy dress			1
" the reason she 's so beloved is that she is sort of her own person and unique in the fashion landscape , " she said			0
" she 's effusive and energetic and positive so that even if young 20 - somethings in @entity132 are n't clamoring to wear @entity5 , or maybe they are because it 's ironic at this point , she 's not someone who 's seen as tired			1
" much of her popularity stems from her industry longevity , not only as a businesswoman but as a vibrant personality known for ending her runway shows with a cartwheel , @entity119 said			0
@entity5 's career began in 1964 , when she officially entered the @entity145 fashion scene by winning @entity148 magazine 's @entity146 , her company biography says			1
one year later , she landed the top designer position for @entity150 , a clothing boutique that housed the hottest young designers			0
in 1978 , after a decade of designing for other labels , @entity5 decided to launch the @entity5 label as it is known today			1
in 1972 , @entity5 , along with @entity155 , won the @entity156 for outstanding designs			1
at the 1999 @entity158 , @entity5 was presented the @entity159 , created especially for her , which recognized her influence on fashion throughout her career			1
in late 2002 , @entity5 was inducted into the @entity163 , honoring her contribution to @entity15 fashion			1
the demise of her stores signals the end of an era			2
as customers gradually buy up the last of the stock inside her standalone stores , what were once pink - walled paradises , equal parts princess and punk , are now somber shells			1
a visit on sunday to the store in @entity22 's @entity180 revealed lonely racks stripped bare of toile jumpers , sequin dolman tunics and crepe babydoll dresses			0
the elaborate displays of colorful purses were gone , leaving empty spaces in their place			0
the pink flowered bench where customers used to try on funky bejeweled high - heeled platform shoes had a big ' sold ' sign on it , as did the artwork in one of the dressing rooms			2
only a few varieties of the celebrated shoes remained on the shelves			0
all of the furnishing and fixtures , including those shelves , were also for sale or sold already			2
yet , the poofy prom - style dresses still cost more than $ 100 , even after storewide discounts from 30 % to 60 % , underscoring complaints that her goods were too expensive and ran too small for the general population			2
" i bet if the prices were more reasonable this would not have happened , " one fan wrote on the @entity5 facebook page			2
" i love her clothes , but it 's hard for me to fit in them			0
they are made for tiny women ; i 'm a 12			0
maybe if she started making larger sizes she could stay open , " another @entity103 fan said			0
it 's a risky move for brands to bypass department stores and branch out into retail because then they have the costs of real estate and overhead to worry about , which usually requires a steep markup , said @entity231 , associate professor of fashion marketing management at @entity145 's @entity233			1
" if your growth is anemic and someone else 's growth is higher than yours , they 're gaining the market share at your expense , " @entity231 said			0
it 's tempting to blame the economy , he said , but the luxury goods market has experienced an upswing the past two years			0
the plain and simple truth is that customers simply stopped shopping at @entity5 as other brands gained market share , he said			2
" you need to think about your target customer and reason for being			0
she was fun and exciting but you need a product that sells			0
your customer out there is looking for goods that are trendy and things you can wear			0
they 're also looking at your competition , " he said			0
" when you talk to fans there 's a loyalty element , she 's hip and cool , but style changes and how does that change affect your purchasing decisions ? " this is n't goodbye forever , though			0
through parent company @entity70 , @entity5 and @entity273 merchandise will still be available in department stores worldwide , which is good news for @entity276 , who embraces @entity5 's exaggerated girliness with a womanly edge			1
" i love how she plays with loud colors , unique prints , and sparkly things			0
i also love the fact that even though her designs are girly and feminine , she makes sure that there 's a twist to them , making girls stand out in any crowd , " the 24 - year - old said			0
@entity292 , who lives in the @entity293 , makes a stop at a @entity5 boutique every time she visits relatives in the @entity15			1
that is , if she has n't already convinced them to send her a little " surprise " in the mail			0
@entity5 even inspired @entity292 to start designing her shoes while in law school			2
while some fans are raiding the shops to keep a bit of @entity5 in their lives , one @entity305 fashionista has a unique connection to the iconic designer			1
@entity312 , 27 , had always been a fan of @entity5 , but when she got married in 2011 , her brand loyalty was solidified by holy matrimony			1
" i was always @entity312 , and then in 2011 i married @entity315 and am now @entity5			2
" on her wedding day , the former ms. @entity312 sported sky - high @entity5 red shoes to pay tribute to her new name			1
while certainly no one can fill @entity5 's shoes , @entity320 does n't think this is the end of @entity5			2
" a lot of designers go ( into ) bankruptcy and bounce back			0
her whole spirit is about being buoyant and resilient and seeing that translating to her business , " she said			0
" her brand will still be around , just not in the same way			0
" are you a @entity5 fan ? tell us about your favorite piece of clothing or accessories by her ! @entity0 's @entity339 contributed to this report .			2
