-- the world is holding its breath for the informal summit between @entity5 president @entity4 and @entity7 president @entity6 in @entity8			1
will @entity4 and @entity6 look into each other 's eyes and see each other as a partner to trust ? will they be able to set the tone for the @entity7 - @entity5 relations for years , if not decades , to come ? i had the privilege of accompanying two @entity7 presidents to the @entity19 in 1985 and 1987 , and being invited as a guest to the @entity19 when @entity7 president @entity21 was welcomed by president @entity22 in april 2006			1
such @entity7 - @entity5 summits have been known for both the substance of the meetings as well as the pomposity and the glamorous bells and whistles of high diplomacy			2
by agreeing to meet without the red carpet and 21 - gun salute , both @entity4 and @entity6 have demonstrated pragmatism and commitment to focusing on the most important , urgent issues between @entity7 and the @entity5 as well as in the world			2
@entity6 should be given credit for his vision , courage and wisdom in agreeing with @entity4 to build up personal rapport and trust between the two most important persons in the world			0
while there have been numerous channels of communications between @entity48 and @entity49 , including the biannual @entity7 - @entity50 , what is sorely lacking between @entity7 and the @entity5 is that trust at the very top			1
what is encouraging is that , unlike the zero - sum game between the @entity5 and the @entity55 in the @entity57 era , today the @entity5 and @entity7 are the two largest economies in the world , and highly integrated with each other			1
the bilateral trade this year will be far beyond $ 500 billion , larger than the gdp of many countries			1
the exchange of people , students , goods , information and investment between the two countries has been breaking records year after year			0
of course , given their different histories , cultural backgrounds , political systems and values , @entity7 and the @entity5 will hardly ever be exactly alike , with friction inevitable between the two countries			0
the challenges are how to establish a sound mechanism to handle such friction effectively and in a timely manner , and how to build common ground and mutual interest so that both countries benefit from increasing trade and exchange			0
furthermore , as the two largest economies and most important countries in the world , the more @entity7 and the @entity5 can see eye to eye on major international issues , the easier it will be to prevent escalation of international crises -- and the more effective they can be at solving them			1
in recent years , i have been using " @entity101 " to describe the high expectations of the future of @entity7 - @entity5 relations			0
the term , which ranks @entity5 and @entity7 alphabetically and in order of their relative importance , is better than " @entity106 " which defies the more logical way of ranking @entity7 and the @entity5 the sense of shared destiny encapsulated in the concept of " @entity101 " will help foster a new way of looking at the @entity7 - @entity5 relations			0
in this spirit , let 's give our best wishes to the @entity4 - @entity6 informal summit in @entity8 , and work collectively to make " @entity101 " a reality			0
@entity101 will be good for @entity5 , good for @entity7 , and good for the rest of the world .			2

@entity121 : what is sorely lacking between @entity7 and the @entity5 is trust at the top
the informal meeting *underlines* the pragmatic relationship between the *superpowers*
@entity5 and @entity7 are the world 's largest economies and highly integrated with each other
the bilateral trade between @entity7 and the @entity5 this year will be beyond $ 500 billion
