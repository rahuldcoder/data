the costs of your airline travel will rise a little today , thanks to the federal government			0
airline passenger security fees charged by the @entity6 are increasing because of the congressional budget deal passed in december			1
the september 11 passenger security fee has traditionally been collected to fund the @entity6 's airport security measures , but not this time			1
most of the new revenue will go to pay down the federal deficit			0
until monday , a passenger was charged $ 2.50 for each leg of a journey			2
for a nonstop round trip , the cost was $ 5			0
for a round trip with a connection each way , the cost was $ 10			0
the fee was capped at two flights each way			0
that means you could n't get charged more than $ 5 each way or $ 10 round trip , even if you took three flights to get your destination			1
now , passengers must pay a flat fee of $ 5.60 in each direction , no matter how many plane transfers are made to get from one city to another			1
for passengers flying a nonstop round trip , that means the fee will increase from $ 5 to $ 11.20			1
passengers flying round - trip with a connection each way will see their fees increase $ 1.20 to $ 11.20 per round trip , versus $ 10 before the fee increase			1
there 's one exception : if you book that terrible trip with a long layover , meaning at least four hours when traveling domestically or 12 hours when traveling internationally , the fees start over			0
passengers with that much of a stopover between their flights will have to pay another $ 5.60 for the next leg			0
the @entity6 's interpretation of the fee increase has been called into question			1
though the @entity6 says the congressional budget deal eliminated caps on these fees , top congressional budget writers say that 's not true			1
sen. @entity66 , @entity67 , and rep. @entity68 , @entity69 , have written the @entity6 demanding an explanation			1
the trade group @entity71 has generally objected to government raising more funds from airline passenger travel and specifically objected to this fee increase and the elimination of the fee cap			1
" our government must stop using airlines and their passengers as its own personal atm whenever it needs more money , " according to a statement			0
" @entity71 strongly opposes @entity6 's elimination of the regulatory regime that rejects congressional intent by removing the cap on the @entity6 fee increase per enplanement as it will disproportionately harm airline passengers who rely on service to small and rural communities			1
" who will pay the fee ? though there 's a chance the airlines could absorb some of the cost , do n't bet on it			2
@entity98 added the fee to its list of taxes and fees charged to customers starting today			0
" effective for bookings starting on july 21 , 2014 , all domestic air carriers are required to implement an increase in the government - imposed september 11th passenger security fee , " @entity98 spokesman @entity103 wrote in an e-mail			2
" the fee increased from $ 2.50 per segment ( with a maximum of $ 10.00 per round - trip ) to $ 5.60 per one - way trip , " @entity103 said			2
" @entity98 customers can view a complete fare breakdown at the time of purchase , which includes the current security fee			0
" @entity119 and @entity120 , which both declined to comment , also appear to be putting the entire cost on passengers			0
a flight search monday at @entity119 showed a charge of $ 11.20 for a nonstop round - trip flight from @entity126 to @entity128 's @entity127			0
so did a @entity120 search for a nonstop round - trip flight from @entity126 to @entity131			0
want to comment on the new rule ? although the fee increase goes into effect today , the @entity6 is accepting public comment through august 19 at regulation.gov			1
search for " @entity6 - 2001 - 11120 - 0085			2
" electronics to be scrutinized under new @entity6 security measures			2

@entity140 raised the fee in a budget deal
most of the money does n't go to back to the @entity6
increase will be $ 1.20 or $ 6.20 for most fliers
