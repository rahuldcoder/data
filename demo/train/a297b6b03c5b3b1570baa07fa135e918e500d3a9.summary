three months of political unrest , one week of horrific internecine violence , a few frenetic hours of negotiations -- it all culminated in a breakthrough deal in @entity5 to cut the president 's powers , reinvent the @entity8 and pave the way to free a key opposition leader			1
these developments friday gave hope to the @entity14 nation			0
but as long as angry protesters pack @entity17 's @entity16 , or @entity16 , as long as the emotions remain raw , as long as the bloodshed is still fresh , this story is n't over			1
" i feel very proud of @entity5 because we showed we are able to struggle for our future , our freedom , " said @entity21 , whose friend was among the scores of demonstrators killed in the capital			2
" but now i feel almost very sadness			0
it 's my first feeling			2
" the agreement -- hashed out overnight and into the afternoon among @entity5 leaders , opposition figures and @entity35 representatives -- drew some cheers when it was announced to the @entity16 crowd			1
track how the crisis in @entity5 unfolded one of the main opposition leaders , @entity41 , took the stage a short time later			1
he got a notably frostier reception , contending that the government was trying to divide the protesters , before walking off to a handful of jeers			2
later , a protester -- not a leader , not part of any political group , just an ordinary @entity5 he insisted -- expressed disappointment with the deal and proposed that action should be taken if president @entity55 does n't resign by 10 a.m. saturday			1
another protester , @entity56 , said simply the deal is " not enough			2
" " this agreement does not pay for the life of my friend and the lives of the @entity5 people , " she said			2
as the crisis brewed in @entity17 , a senior @entity65 official -- who talked to reporters on condition of not being identified and who had just been on the phone with @entity5 's foreign minister -- said that @entity55 had gone to @entity71 , @entity5 's second 's largest city , for a meeting			1
the same official characterized such travel to eastern @entity5 by the president as " not unusual			1
" while the government revolves around @entity55 , there is not a single face of the opposition			1
its demonstrators have strong and varying opinions about what they 'd accept -- and what they 'd be willing to do if these standards are n't met			0
thus , while there is an apparent truce , there 's not peace in the @entity5			1
uncertainty , anger and anxiety still predominating , helping to paralyze parts of this eastern @entity14 nation			0
" it 's not possible to work in this environment , not to study , ( not ) to do nothing , " said another protester by the name of @entity98			0
" basically everything has stopped and we 're waiting for this situation to resolve			0
and it 's really exhausting			0
" deal calls for cutting powers , end to occupation friday was a day of action -- but unlike on tuesday and thursday , thankfully , the action happened in meeting rooms and @entity112 , rather than in pitched battles on the streets			2
the first , biggest announcement on this front was the landmark agreement calling for cutting the president 's power and rolling back the @entity8 to what it had been in 2004			1
according to a draft posted on the @entity125 's website , further constitutional reforms must be completed by september			0
" good compromise for @entity5			2
opens the way to reform and to @entity134 , " @entity130 foreign minister @entity129 said via @entity131			0
the deal also requires presidential elections " as soon as the new @entity8 is adopted but no later than december 2014			0
" and there will be an investigation -- conducted by government authorities , opposition figures and @entity142 representatives -- into the violence			2
by then , security forces should 've long ago stepped back from a " confrontational posture " with permission to use force only to protect pubic buildings , per the agreement			0
and within 48 hours , protesters should have turned in their illegal weapons and withdrawn from streets and public buildings			0
but will they ? in a conversation urging a protest leader to accept the deal that was overheard by @entity161 / @entity160 , @entity129 pleaded , " if you do n't support this , you 'll have martial law , you 'll have the army			2
you will all be dead			0
" the @entity65 official acknowledged the agreement is " a very tough sell " for many seething opposition activists , and called the deal " very , very fragile			1
" speaking to @entity169 , @entity41 said he 's listening to his side 's dissenters and still pushing to maintain pressure on @entity55 -- but not through violence			1
" i tell everybody it is very important ... not to be involved in the war , " said @entity41 , who called ensuring that the country does n't " split " as a top priority			0
" ( it 's ) also very important to find a peaceful way to be the winner			1
" @entity112 acts to free opposition leader hours after that deal was signed , @entity5 's @entity112 , the @entity183 , moved quickly to pass a series of measures seemingly in line with protesters ' demands			1
the first order of business was to fulfill the first requirement of the agreement -- passing a law to roll back the country 's constitution to an earlier version that limits the president 's powers			1
other bills called for the dismissal of the nation 's interior minister and release of @entity205 , a former prime minister who earlier was a hero of the country 's 2004 revolution , and who is a powerful symbol to the opposition			2
a year after @entity205 lost the 2010 presidential election to @entity55 and became his fiercest opponent , @entity5 prosecutors charged her with signing overpriced gas deals with @entity216 state - owned energy provider @entity215			1
she was convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison at a trial she repeatedly called a farce overseen by a judge she called @entity55 's " stooge			1
" international observers criticized her trial as being a politically motivated sham			0
even with parliament 's action , @entity205 's freedom was not expected to be immediate : a court must now act to free her , and other charges pending against her remain in place			0
violence erupts this wave of unrest began in november , amid anger about @entity55 's decision to scrap a @entity35 - oriented trade deal and turn toward @entity216			1
@entity216 , which has offered to lend money to cash - strapped @entity5 in a deal worth billions of dollars and to lower its gas prices , has put pressure on @entity55 to crack down on demonstrators			1
@entity243 leaders , who have offered @entity5 a more long - term aid package requiring economic modernization , urged the president to show restraint , open up the government to the opposition and let the democratic process work out			1
yet , fairly soon , it became clear that the discord was n't just about @entity5 's ties to @entity134 or @entity216 , but about larger issues such as corruption and control			1
the opposition called @entity55 heavy - handed , with @entity41 and others saying protesters would n't leave @entity16 until the president resigns			1
this tension boiled over tuesday , when security forces waded into a @entity17 crowd with water cannons , stun grenades , nightsticks and armored personnel carriers			0
at least 26 people -- protesters and police alike -- were killed			0
late wednesday , the government announced it and opposition leaders agreed to a truce and to start talks aimed at a longer - term solution			0
but it did n't last , collapsing in unprecedented gore in @entity17 and unrest elsewhere in the @entity5			2
some protesters in the capital appeared to be armed , while men wearing what looked like government uniforms fired what appeared to be automatic weapons and , in at least one case , a sniper rifle			0
the government later confirmed its police fired at protesters , explaining they did so to protect unarmed officers			0
the death toll was far more uneven than on tuesday : while authorities said three more police died , protesters said more than 100 of their own had been killed			0
the fresh blood sparked outrage among @entity243 governments , several of which pushed sanctions against those responsible			0
even after friday 's deal was announced , demonstrators went to graphic lengths to remember the dead -- bringing coffins onto their stage in @entity16			2
@entity310 , a demonstrator who identified himself only by his first name , said he 'd helped carry away some of those shot thursday , and he insisted he wo n't forget , nor will he give up			0
" as long as ( @entity55 ) is president , " he said , " the movement will continue			1
" explainer : what and who are behind @entity5 's political crisis ? @entity318 : protester describes bloodied people being rushed to medics @entity322 talks tough , but options limited in @entity5			1

opposition leader : it 's " very important to find a peaceful way to be the winner "
@entity331 , opposition agree on deal to end violence , alter constitution
some protesters say the deal is " not enough , " demand president 's resignation
@entity55 is *believed* to have gone to eastern @entity5 , @entity322 official says
