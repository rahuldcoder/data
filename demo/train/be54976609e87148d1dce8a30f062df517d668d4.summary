-- @entity1 equaled @entity4 's @entity3 appearance record as the @entity6 champions continued their revival under new coach @entity8 with a 4 - 1 win over @entity10 on saturday			1
the 37 - year - old midfielder matched the mark of 519 league games set by @entity14 in 1999 , having passed 700 in all competitions in the black and blue of the @entity18 in may 's @entity20 final win over @entity21			1
he will have the record to himself if he plays in wednesday 's home match against @entity24			0
" there is no end to the positive things to say about @entity1 , he is a wonderful athlete and human being			0
he was my first signing , " said @entity4 president @entity29 , who brought the former @entity31 international to the @entity32 in 1995			0
but it was one of the club 's more recent signings who inspired a win which lifted @entity4 into fourth above @entity40 on goal difference and eight points adrift of leaders @entity44 , who travel to @entity45 on sunday night			0
@entity47 striker @entity46 set up @entity49 's 20th - minute opener and scored a second - half double to take his tally to 23 for the season in just 26 games in all competitions			1
@entity49 provided a perfect throughball that allowed @entity56 to score the second goal on the half - hour , with the @entity58 having headed against the near post early in the match			0
@entity56 's clever backheel provided @entity46 with a one - two into the area in the 63rd minute and the former @entity64 star slotted home a right - foot effort			2
the four - time african player of the year made it 4 - 0 with 19 minutes to play as he curled in a freekick , while @entity70 scored a consolation six minutes later for the visitors -- who remained in 15th place after being penalized three points earlier this week for infringing rules over tax and player payments			1
it was the fourth successive victory for @entity80 @entity8 , who replaced the sacked @entity81 last month			0
second - placed @entity82 could have closed to within a point of @entity8 's former club @entity44 with victory at home to mid-table @entity87 , but ended up being held to a frustrating goalless draw			1
it was a disappointing result following last weekend 's 3 - 0 win over @entity91 .			2

@entity1 makes his 519th @entity6 league appearance for @entity4
*veteran* midfielder matches mark set by @entity14 as @entity4 beat @entity10
