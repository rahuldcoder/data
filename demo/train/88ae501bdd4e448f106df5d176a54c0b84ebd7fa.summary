@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 prosecutors have gathered " great evidence " against the son of former dictator @entity8 , @entity4 chief prosecutor @entity3 said thursday , reopening the controversial question of where @entity10 will be tried			1
both the @entity4 and @entity1 's new authorities want to put him on trial , and the two sides have been battling over it since his capture in november			1
the court demanded this month that @entity1 hand him over immediately to face accusations of crimes against humanity , but @entity1 appealed the decision			1
@entity1 interim prime minister @entity21 told @entity2 in an exclusive interview that @entity8 could " absolutely " get a fair trial in @entity1 and that he should face justice there			1
" we intend to project the real image of the new @entity1 , " he said			1
asked about the doubts voiced by human rights groups over the country 's capacity to stage the trial properly , he responded : " i can guarantee you that we will prove them wrong , we are ready ... to go and give him the proper justice and a fair trial			1
" @entity3 , visiting @entity1 on thursday , raised the possibility that the @entity1 wish would be granted			1
@entity1 prosecutors told him they had interviewed witnesses , including " high - level people " they have in custody , and had gathered phone intercepts and documents , @entity3 said			1
it includes specific evidence showing @entity10 allegedly committing crimes with his own hands , not just ordering it , he said			2
@entity3 said he had just learned for the first time that the @entity1 had opened an investigation in december			2
" we had a meeting with the @entity1 prosecutor , " he said			2
" for the first time we learned he opened an investigation in december 2011 about the same crimes we investigated , and he has many witnesses			0
so he has a case			0
" @entity1 authorities must now present their evidence to @entity4 judges , along with the explanation of how they will be able to hold a fair trial , the international prosecutor said			1
" now @entity1 has to present this to the judges			2
and they promised to do that , " he said			0
they consider it " crucial " for the @entity1 people to see the son of the late dictator face justice in his own country , @entity3 said the authorities told him			1
" the @entity1 have to see @entity10 here , and they have to show that they can do it			1
that 's the goal , " he said			0
if the @entity4 judges are satisfied , they will allow @entity1 to try @entity10 themselves , he said			1
@entity10 was facing an arrest warrant from the court for alleged crimes against humanity at the time fighters from the @entity1 city of @entity88 captured him			1
he has been detained there since november			0
@entity21 said authorities in @entity0 were in negotiations with those holding @entity8 in @entity88 to transfer him to the capital			0
the @entity88 representatives are worried about his safety and security , @entity21 said , but those concerns are ones that can be met			0
the handover " wo n't take long , " he said			0
@entity4 defense lawyers said april 5 that @entity8 had been mistreated and " physically attacked " in custody			2
@entity8 is in a " legal black hole , " held in " total isolation " except for visits from officials , his @entity4 - appointed defense said in a strongly worded statement			2
he also suffers dental pain because he has n't had treatment , and @entity1 authorities have given him nothing to remedy the pain , lawyers @entity108 and @entity110 said			2
" the brutal death of @entity8 deprived the @entity1 people of their right to justice and their right to the truth			0
it would be a travesty for the prospects of a free and fair @entity1 state if the same were to occur to his son , " they said			1
@entity8 died after opposition forces captured him in october			0
but @entity21 rejected the defense attorneys ' suggestion that the younger @entity8 was suffering ill treatment in captivity			0
" i can guarantee you that he has been safe , he has been treated definitely in a humane and a very decent manner , " he said			0
drawing a contrast with the regime under @entity8 , @entity21 said @entity1 had " definitely changed tremendously -- it 's 180 degrees ( different ) when it comes to human rights and respecting human rights			0
" @entity2 's @entity139 contributed to this report .			0
