-- in @entity2 , a 64 - year - old bus driver has been criticized for failing to physically intervene in a three - on - one fight that took place in july			1
the bus driver says he was afraid to step in			1
as a high school teacher , i ca n't blame him			1
the adults who work in public schools are outnumbered			2
when a violent , hormone - fueled scene unfolds , it 's our duty to quell the calamity with every resource we have in the name of safety			2
but where do we draw the line ? early in my teaching career , i was afraid of some of the bigger boys at school , especially one			1
i could see he carried a great deal of hatred inside -- for me , for his classmates , for the world			2
he was tall and muscular ; he could have been an athlete , but his poor grades , bad attitude and spotty record kept him from playing sports			2
one afternoon , as i waited outside my classroom door , i heard a scuffle behind me			0
the boy i feared and another , smaller boy were shoving each other by my white board			0
i stepped in , and told them to stop			1
when they did n't , i shouted louder and told another student , my go - to helper , to get another teacher			1
as the shoves turned to punches , rage grew in the larger boy 's eyes			0
the other student asked him to stop , but he had thrust his hands around his neck			1
i tried to pull him free , but the large boy shoved , pressing the other student and my arm against the cinder block wall			0
i felt trapped and frightened , and thought i might black out			0
just then , two male teachers pulled the boys apart and dragged them to the office			1
" are you ok ? " a third teacher said			1
" look at your hand ! " my wrist was red and swollen			0
it hurt , but not as much as knowing i was n't safe in my own classroom			1
my neighbor teacher took over my class so that i could go to the office to fill out an incident report			1
i could barely grip the pen			0
two police officers assigned to our school urged me to file assault charges against the boys , but i insisted they just had n't seen me			1
i wanted to believe that they would n't hurt me , but i also wondered if the boy would retaliate if the law got involved			1
fortunately , my wrist was only sprained and i returned to work the next day in a cumbersome brace			0
but i kept wondering , what if the boy had pushed the other one harder ? what if his anger was directed at me ? suppose it was my head that was smashed against that cinderblock wall ? what if he 'd had a weapon ? on the other side , what if adrenaline gave me undiscovered strength and i had hurt one of them ? could their parents sue me ? would i lose my job ? both students were expelled , but the one i 'd been afraid of eventually returned			0
" @entity102 , man , " he 'd scowl when i asked him to hurry along to class			0
when i saw anger in his eyes , i backed away , and if needed , i asked for help			0
almost a decade later and much wiser , i 'm no longer afraid of my students , but i 've made some changes to how i approach fights since then			0
i shout at students to stop and try to keep the crowd under control from a distance			1
if available and in working order , i 'll use a radio or phone to contact administrators or school resource officers			1
their appearance usually signals the end of a fight			2
after all , administrators are the disciplinarians in the school , with more training and higher pay than teachers , bus drivers or janitors			1
officers wear badges , carry the pepper spray and , above all , are trained for combat situations			0
of the many classes one must take in order to earn a teaching degree , not one prepares us for the possibility of classroom combat			0
supplemental training in restraints and fight intervention is made available to some teachers , but i and most other teachers i know are mainly qualified to fight ignorance			1
we 're the ones who can prevent fights from happening in the first place			0
i always ask a student who seems angrier or quieter than usual what 's wrong , even if , " nothing , " is the only answer i receive			0
i always listen to my students ' seemingly banal chatter because fights seldom break out without some sort of a build up			0
many times , one of my students , like a high school @entity162 , will bring an upcoming brawl to my attention			2
if fight rumors start to flood the hallways , or even if something seems a little off , it 's best to bring it to the attention of the administrators or school resource officers			1
in many cases , students want an adult to intervene before the first fist is thrown			2
i 've learned that the most responsible action can be protecting yourself so you can care for others			1
in keeping myself safe , i 'm better able to protect my other students , the innocent bystanders			0
i have children of my own who need me to be functioning at 100 %			0
i 'm pregnant now , and when school starts in a few weeks , i must first and foremost protect my unborn child			2
for all of those reasons and more i will remain a conscientious objector during fights that occur in my classroom			0
as a parent , i 'd expect the same of my children 's teachers			2
i know that , like me , they did n't enter their classrooms to be prison guards , and that they 'd prefer to guide children toward higher roads to civility			2
sometimes it just takes a peaceful protest to get them there			0
would you step in to stop a fight among teens ? do you expect the people who work at your child 's school to do it ? share your thoughts in the comments , on @entity213 's facebook page or on @entity214 .			1
