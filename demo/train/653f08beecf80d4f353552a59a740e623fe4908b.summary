-- here 's a little secret @entity1 does n't want you to know : it would be technically impossible for all @entity5 phones or @entity6 to experience a global four - day outage like the one @entity1 saw this week , according to mobile communications experts			1
why ? the answer is in the technical details of how @entity11 -- the company that makes @entity1 smartphones , with their click - clacking keyboards and tie - wearing owners -- handles e-mails and text messages			1
here 's the gist : @entity11 acts as a middleman for all e-mail and @entity1 text messages			1
it picks up messages from the wireless carrier and passes them on to the recipient			0
@entity25 and @entity6 do n't have a middleman for texts and e-mail			2
it 's this @entity1 baton - passing system that went down monday , killing or slowing e-mail and texting services for millions of people in @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , the @entity38 and @entity39			1
the ordeal lasted four days			0
" it 's because of the way @entity11 has set up the ( network ) architecture that is the downfall when it comes to these types of outages , " said @entity41 , who manages wireless communications at a large tech company			0
" when it 's working fine , it 's a great system			0
when it 's not working fine , it 's a failure			0
" this week , it 's fair to say the system was a big ol ' failure			2
on social media sites , some @entity1 users said they were so upset about the outage -- the largest in the company 's history -- that they were switching to @entity63 and @entity64 @entity5 devices			1
and customer satisfaction with @entity1 already was low			2
" add up every other thing we 've ever written about why @entity1 is dying , " wrote the tech blog @entity67			2
" this is not to say that @entity25 and @entity6 never experience network outages			0
but they would n't be global			2
and they would be the responsibility of a particular wireless carrier -- @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 -- or a particular messaging system , like @entity82 , @entity83 or @entity84 , @entity86 's new in - house messaging service			1
not the maker of the phone			0
that makes their problems inherently more localized			0
" all the stuff goes through them for some form or fashion , " @entity92 , a writer for the site @entity94 , said of the way @entity1 handles messages and e-mail			1
that makes it possible , he said , for the global @entity1 network to crash , which would n't be the case for iphones or @entity25			1
@entity11 , however , takes issue with this analysis			0
" i would not characterize that as fair , " @entity11 's co-ceo @entity111 said at a thursday news conference			0
" we run a global , secure - push environment that provides the kind of instant messaging that 's made @entity1 so compelling and so valuable			1
" @entity11 filters e-mails and blackberry messages through its own server farms -- giant warehouses full of computers -- for security reasons , said @entity41			2
the company scrambles messages , making them more difficult to intercept			0
that 's won @entity1 big fans in the business world			1
the system also uses less battery power because @entity11 handles much of the computation work , @entity41 said			0
" the process for checking your e-mail with a @entity1 is done by the @entity11 servers , " he said			1
" so @entity11 is going to handle all the heavy lifting of going to your inbox and looking for new e-mail , and if it finds new e-mail , it 's going to push it back your devices			1
" it also creates the risk of a global crash			2
but maybe that 's not a completely bad thing			0
" for two years , we have n't had a huge issue like this , " @entity41 said			0
" it 's just been little bumps along the way			0
so i do n't really see ( the middle - man system ) as a weakness			1
i see it as expected , because no system can be faultless			0
" @entity156 , who runs the industry blog @entity158 , said it 's clear @entity1 was unprepared for a failure like the one that began on monday			1
" from what we can see from this outage , it appears @entity11 does n't have the infrastructure or the process in place to handle a failure properly when it happens and then to recover from it once it 's got a backlog of e-mail in its pipes , " he said			1
@entity11 has said this week 's outage was caused by a failure at one of its messaging servers in @entity34 , along with the subsequent failure of its backup system			1
@entity178 , a senior editor for technology at @entity180 , said problems like the one @entity1 had this week could actually become more common because people are storing more of their data -- from photos to music and documents -- in the cloud , meaning on remote computer servers rather than at home			1
" if these services ever get disrupted , that could just mean a lot of unhappy customers , " he said			0
" more and more of our stuff is stored on remote servers , and there 's increasing burden on the networks to have them available 24/7			2
" as the @entity1 outage shows , he said , not all of them are ready .			0

experts : iphones and @entity5 devices will not see a global messaging crash
@entity1 filters messages through its own servers ; @entity86 and @entity64 do n't
@entity1 's middle - man *approach* to messaging is what crashed this week
millions of @entity1 users were without e-mail service for more than three days
