" the situation in @entity1 is tense , volatile and unpredictable			1
there is a real risk of loss of life and injury unless human rights are fully respected , " said @entity32 , the rights group 's @entity33 deputy director			1
" security forces should ensure that the right to peaceful protest is upheld -- however , they also have a duty to protect the safety of the public			2
when carrying out their work , law enforcement officials should apply nonviolent means before resorting to the use of force , and always exercise restraint in its use			2
" @entity28 also urged protest leaders to " call on their followers not to commit human rights abuses			1
" the @entity1 government has deployed some 15,000 military and police to the capital ahead of the planned shutdown , the rights group said			1

ambitious goal protest leaders have said they want to rid @entity1 of the influence of former prime minister @entity136 , the older brother of @entity13			1
that 's an ambitious goal in a country where every election since 2001 has been won by parties affiliated with @entity136 , a billionaire who built his political success on populist policies that appealed to @entity1 's rural heartland			2

if he returns , he risks a two - year prison sentence on a corruption conviction , which he says was politically motivated			0
the recent protests in @entity0 were prompted by a botched attempt by @entity13 's government to pass an amnesty bill that would have opened the door for her brother 's return			1

@entity136 's traditional support comes from the populous rural areas of north and northeast @entity1			2

they support the holding of elections on february 2			0
