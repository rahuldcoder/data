into more sexually adventurous waters			2
i 'm always careful to make clear that while the adventures of @entity10 and @entity11 may make for a compelling erotic yarn , their story is by no means an accurate depiction of bdsm relationships ( bondage , discipline , dominance , submission , sadism , masochism ) , nor is " @entity3 " any sort of guide book			1
for instruction on that topic , you 'll need to turn to the works of true sex - positive educators such as @entity29 or @entity30 and their books " @entity32 " and " @entity33 to @entity34 , " respectively			1
but there 's no denying that " @entity3 " has sparked widespread interest in how to improve our sex lives -- and what better way to do that than via a good " how - to " book ? if you 're uncomfortable talking about sex to your friends , doctor , therapist or even your partner , such books can be an important resource , whether they impart new information , help you work through an issue , inspire you to become more adventurous or simply turn you on			1
so , in the spirit of sharing , i asked some of my favorite sex experts to pick their favorite sex books : @entity57 , a research scientist at @entity58 and the author of " @entity60 : " " hands down , i recommend ' @entity61 ' by @entity62			1
a classic in the field , it gives a rich picture of men 's sexual lives including myths they 're taught about sex and common problems such as erectile issues , communication blocks and rapid ejaculation as well as solutions for these problems			1
" @entity77 , a clinical sexologist and founder of the @entity79 and sexual health : " i recommend @entity82 's ' the @entity81 , ' which helps remove the shame of sexual behaviors and fantasies by understanding what they mean in a nonsexual way			0
@entity89 addresses where fantasies and desires come from and how shame can be removed and replaced with healthy acceptance for individuals and couples			0
" stay - at - home dads are sexy @entity98 , sex coach and founder of @entity100 : " ' @entity101 : over 200 things you can try tonight ' by @entity104 and @entity105 is a fun , sensual , seductive , creative and tantalizing book filled with more than 200 ways to tease , play , entwine and explore			1
when i coach couples who are in a sex rut , i suggest they use this book as a tool			1
" @entity113 , sex educator , researcher and therapist : " if i had to pick , i would choose either ' @entity116 ' by @entity117 or ' the 5 @entity118 ' by @entity119			1
both are extremely helpful for couples to understand how men and women are wired differently and to learn how to love one another in a way that lasts			0
" @entity125 , @entity126 social psychologist and online sex columnist at @entity128 : " ' the @entity129 ' by @entity130 chronicles the history of ' hysteria , ' a bogus female medical condition that led to invention of the vibrator			2
@entity130 ' book is a meticulously researched , fascinating and humorous look at the origin of hysteria and the birth of the motorized sex toy			2
" i also adore ' @entity142 : the @entity143 ' by @entity144 , which traces the history of how scientists have studied sexual arousal and orgasm in a very engaging way that refuses to take itself too seriously and never gets bogged down in jargon or technicalities			0
" on a personal level , ' @entity142 ' holds a special place in my heart for helping me realize how much fun a career in sex research could be			2
" @entity159 , certified sexuality educator and sexologist : " ' @entity162 's @entity161 ' by @entity163 describes ridiculous sex laws and research that @entity162 are led to believe are true			2
it 's a must - read book for anyone interested in sociology , psychology , sexuality education , law and parenting			0
" i 'm also a fan of ' @entity173 ' by @entity174 , which discussed women 's fantasies well before erotica became truly popular			0
" are you too tired for sex ? i 've read and recommend many of these books myself , and this list is only the beginning of many exceptional works worth exploring and learning from			1
in my opinion , no list would be complete without @entity189 's " mating in @entity188 , " an excellent guide to integrating a sense of sexual mystery into long - term relationships			2
and on a personal note , in 10 years of writing sex books , my first , " she comes first : the thinking man 's guide to pleasuring a woman , " remains my most popular			1
at the time , i often mused that many men -- through no fault of their own -- knew more about what was under the hood of a car than under a woman 's clothes or what was behind her orgasm			0
in writing " she comes first , " i am grateful to the @entity210 and their book , " @entity212 of a @entity213 " ( unfortunately now out of print ) and to @entity216 's excellent book , " the @entity217			0
" any man or woman truly interested in deepening their knowledge of a woman 's full sexual potential should give this book a read			0
no matter where your sexual interests lie , you 're sure to find something new on the shelves of your local bookstore			0
and if you 're too embarrassed to shop in person -- well , that 's the beauty of the @entity234 , @entity235 and other e-readers -- no plain brown wrapper necessary ! any books to add to the list that have helped you improve your sex life ? tell me about them in the comments below			1
i 'm always looking for a good read			0
