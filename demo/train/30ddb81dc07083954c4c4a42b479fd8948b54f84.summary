-- the last time we saw him on our tv sets , @entity1 was playing " @entity6 " 's beloved dr. @entity4 before he met an untimely end in 2009			1
in his first television role since ( he 's been continuing a successful stage career ) , @entity1 plays somewhat against type : @entity4 was the bumbling , baby - faced surgeon with a nervous smile and horrible luck with women ; his latest character , @entity16 from last night 's " @entity17 : @entity18 , " is an alleged ( spoiler alert ! ) " power - reassurance serial rapist " with a neck tattoo -- sure , the tat is of a yin - yang symbol -- but still , a neck tattoo pretty much never screams " nice guy			1
" @entity16 sure looks like @entity4 , but that 's where the similarities end			0
like @entity4 , @entity16 's into blonds , but only of the submissive variety -- that would certainly exclude @entity32			1
it 's rather inspired to cast an actor so associated with a recognizably benevolent character in such a disturbing role ( sort of the effect @entity39 had as the expressionless , evil @entity40 in " @entity41 " )			1
seeing @entity1 go from a bright - eyed family man one moment to a sinister predator who snarls , " tell me you love me , @entity46 " to the women he 's assaulting ( ick ) in the next is appropriately chilling			2
and , as it turns out , the dichotomy makes even more sense as , in a twist typical of this long - in - the - tooth series , @entity1 is pulling a @entity54 and playing estranged identical twins , one of whom has a seemingly charmed life whereas the other 's is in serious shambles			2
it may be a long shot , but for fans , his appearance on " @entity17 " might be a sign of more @entity1 to come			2
in the enduring spirit of cross-promotion , @entity66 seems to use " svu " as a testing ground for future series leads			0
beautiful relationships between @entity66 and stars often begin in that famous interrogation room			0
just look at @entity75 's two roles ramping up to heroes , and @entity78 's significant role last season en route to @entity81 ( which really is getting better -- save that show ! )			0
even though @entity1 's return to tv was welcome in my eyes , i found his performance weirdly unsatisfying			0
he did n't get to sink his teeth into his role ( s ) as much as i 'd hoped because a lot of the episode was devoted to initiating new detectives @entity94 ( @entity95 ) and @entity96 ( @entity97 ) ; plus , his characters ' @entity99 accent sounded a bit inconsistent -- anyone else notice that ? see the full article at @entity0			1
