-- the score looked close , but @entity3 's domination was all too apparent as the world champions began the @entity5 with a 2 - 1 victory over @entity7 on sunday			1
the eight - nation tournament is a warm - up for next year 's @entity10 in @entity11 , but on this evidence @entity13 's team will once again be favored to lift the trophy			1
" it 's very difficult to generate any kind of danger when you do n't touch the ball , " said @entity7 striker @entity16 , who scored a superb late consolation with a curling free - kick that matched the one by @entity21 's @entity20 against @entity22 earlier in the day			1
" @entity3 is the best side in the world			2
they are a candidate to win the @entity10 , " @entity16 added			2
his team trailed after 20 minutes of the @entity34 opener in @entity35 when @entity37 's volley was diverted into the net by captain @entity39 , completely wrongfooting goalkeeper @entity40			1
if that effort had a slice of luck , @entity3 's second in the 32nd minute was straight from the counter-attacking guidebook			1
@entity16 lost the ball deep inside the opposing half , and seconds later it was in the @entity7 net as striker @entity49 finished off a clever pass from @entity51 which beat the offside trap			1
with @entity3 in control , @entity7 's frustrations grew -- and the team which finished fourth at the @entity56 and won the @entity58 title the following year could have gone 3 - 0 down as @entity51 hit the inside of the post			1
@entity16 , who has been publicly courting a transfer from @entity62 to @entity63 , showed flashes of the brilliance which made him one of the top scorers in the @entity68 last season			2
his 88th - minute set - piece was too good for keeper @entity70 , who started the match despite being frozen out at @entity63 in 2012 - 13 under the @entity74 club 's former coach @entity72			2
@entity21 joined hosts @entity11 on three points in @entity77 after beating @entity22 2 - 1 at the @entity78 in @entity79			1
veteran @entity80 midfielder @entity20 celebrated his 100th international appearance with the opening goal in the 27th minute , curling a superb right - foot shot past goalkeeper @entity85			0
@entity86 leveled before halftime from the penalty spot after @entity89 brought down @entity90 , but striker @entity91 showed great strength to hold off two defenders and fire a 78th - minute winner			1
however , he was booked for taking his shirt off in celebration -- earning a rebuke from coach @entity98			0
" @entity91 needs to stop showing off his muscles			0
with celebrations like that , he 's only going to pick up pointless yellow cards , " @entity98 said			0
" as for @entity20 , i do n't have words to describe what he did today			0
he 's the epitome of football and an example to everyone			0
he deserves a big round of applause			0
he gave us the lead and controlled the game			0
" @entity22 coach @entity114 said his players had hoped to play a cautious game and wear down the four - time @entity10 winners			2
" but we were up against a great side who were very well organized and made the most of their individual assets			0
that 's what made the difference , " said @entity123 , whose team suffered a first defeat since august .			0
