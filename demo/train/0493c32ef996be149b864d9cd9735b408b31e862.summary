@entity3 found not guilty ' they want revenge ' @entity3 's attorney describes him as a marked man			1
" he has to be very cautious and protective of his safety because there is still a fringe element who have said ... that they will not listen to a verdict of not guilty , " said @entity14			0
@entity3 , 29 , has kept his address under wraps for more than a year and worn a disguise whenever he left his four walls			1
he has often strapped on body armor , according to @entity14			0
and he may feel the need to be armed			2
when asked by @entity0 's @entity27 whether @entity3 will keep the gun used in the killing , his brother , @entity31 , said , " i do n't see any reason why he should n't			1
" i think he has more reason now than ever to think that people are trying to kill him because they express they 're trying to kill him , all the time , every day , on my @entity40 feed , on the @entity41			0
" catch up on the trial , verdict @entity31 gave more details sunday on @entity0 's " @entity45			1
" " the threats are vile , they 're vicious , they 're disgusting			2
and sometimes they 're in person			2
people wearing shirts with my brother 's face on it in crosshairs , encouraging others to act out violently against him			1
i know that you ca n't take every one one of those seriously , but you ca n't afford to be wrong either			0
because you can be dead wrong if somebody really were intent on harming you			0
" " he 's going to have to learn to move about in a very low - profile way and keep to himself , " @entity31 said , although having the @entity61 removed and no trial to occupy his days helps end @entity3 's feeling of being " kind of caged in			1
" @entity3 , married with no children , may leave @entity65 and choose to lead a life in the shadows -- like @entity68 , the @entity65 woman acquitted of killing her 2 - year - old daughter in 2008			1
anger , sadness but little surprise @entity3 could face more criminal charges with the state criminal case over , @entity3 could now face new criminal charges			1

the @entity79 has called on the @entity80 to file civil rights charges , and is asking the public to sign a petition			2
" the most fundamental of civil rights -- the right to life -- was violated the night @entity3 stalked and then took the life of @entity8 , " the group said			1
@entity3 , a neighborhood watch volunteer , acknowledged killing the unarmed teen , saying it was in self - defense			1
the @entity80 did not respond directly to the @entity79 demand			0
it has a separate federal investigation going on			2
an official told @entity0 the department " continues to evaluate the evidence generated during the federal investigation , as well as the evidence and testimony from the state trial			1
" meanwhile , the @entity8 family could file a civil lawsuit against @entity3 , seeking damages			1
the suit would claim wrongful death -- which is easier to prove than murder or manslaughter			2
and the rev. @entity107 said the acquittal was " only the first round in the pursuit of justice			0
" @entity79 president @entity112 expects legal action will proceed on both fronts			0
" there will be a civil phase almost assuredly , and then there will be a federal civil rights phase , " he told @entity0 's " @entity119 " on sunday			1
" and we are putting our faith in that system			0
" @entity31 rejected @entity124 ' call for charges against his brother			2
authorities have interviewed " about three dozen of his closest friends and acquaintances			0
and there is not any inkling of racism , " he said			0
" in fact , there 's evidence to show the opposite			2
i would encourage them to cool their jets , give everyone some time to kind of process what 's going on			2
" agitation does n't help us			0
it does n't do anybody any good right now			0
" sports stars sound off on verdict ' emotional and psychological hurdles ' those who defend @entity3 say he will struggle for the rest of his life over what happened , despite his contention that it was in self - defense			1
" in his religious beliefs , death by any definition is a tragedy , " @entity31 told @entity0 's @entity27			1
" so he has moral things that he 's going to have to deal with , and emotional and psychological hurdles he 's going to have to overcome			0
" those who believe he should be in jail for murder are quick to point out that @entity8 lost his life , and say there should be no tears shed for any struggles @entity3 may face			1
a young man 's post on @entity172 about @entity3 's future quickly went viral sunday			1
" for the rest of your life you are now going to feel what its like to be a black man in @entity181 , " @entity174 wrote			1
" you will feel people stare at you			0
judging you for what you think are unfair reasons			0
you will lose out on getting jobs for something you feel is outside of your control			0
you will believe yourself to be an upstanding citizen and wonder why people choose to not see that			0
... " i bet you never thought that by shooting a black male you 'd end up inheriting all of his struggles			0
" @entity174 added , " enjoy your ' freedom			0
' " @entity3 could still be held responsible for @entity8 's death support for @entity3 @entity3 's supporters have sent letters and e-mails to his lawyers , offering moral support and saying they sympathized with a man so concerned about neighborhood break - ins that he bought a gun and dog , and donned the mantle of neighborhood watchman			1
the letters often blame the media for his woes and offer encouragement for the road ahead			0
after the verdict , @entity14 too assailed news outlets for their coverage			0
" he was like a patient in an operating table where mad scientists were committing experiments on him and he had no anesthesia , " he said			0
many supporters sent in money to a website he established to help with his mounting legal bills			0

" he 's got to be careful about who he associates with afterward , even if they are offering financial support , " said @entity227			0
despite what may lie ahead , on saturday night , as his legal team surrounded him and congratulated each other with handshakes and hugs , @entity3 seemed to take a moment to soak in the relief -- aware that a long road lies ahead			2
