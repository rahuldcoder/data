-- three monkeys dressed in suits crouch on bulging sacks of money , striking the symbolic pose of " hear no evil , see no evil , speak no evil			0
" at more than 10 - meters tall , the imposing chimps are the size of a three - storey building , dwarfing onlookers gazing up at their grim , spray - painted faces			0
the menacing monkeys are joined on all sides by similarly fantastical and macabre creatures -- from skeleton divers to slobbering pigs -- and you get the feeling that out here , in the desolate @entity24 marshlands , no one would hear you scream were they to come alive			0
a hulking , rusting , abandoned ship on the @entity29 in north @entity30 , which has become a canvas for some of the most renowned graffiti artists from across @entity34			1
read related : ghostly underwater art gallery breathes new life to sunken ship " it 's got the potential to be the biggest open - air art project in the world , " ship co-ordinator , @entity38 , said			1
" the quality and size of the pieces is spectacular -- there are n't many places in the world that can accommodate artworks 10 - meters high			1
" work of art at a whopping 137 - meters long , seven storeys tall , and weighing 4,500 - tons , the former cruise liner is an awe - inspiring sight in the deserted countryside			2
it was this remarkable setting which prompted graffiti collective @entity55 -- a word play on the @entity30 for " black duke " -- to approach the ship 's owners with the innovative idea of turning the abandoned vessel into a thriving arts destination			1
with the owners ' approval , artists from across @entity34 began spray painting the decrepit ship , using cherry pickers -- a type of hydraulic aerial work platform -- to reach its towering walls			1
they are now campaigning to have the site reopened to the public as the centerpiece of an arts festival			1
" when the pieces first started appearing , we had some people say ' that 's no way to treat the ship			2
" but there 's no doubt that what they 're doing is art -- the key definition between art and graffiti is graffiti is done illegally			2
this , however , is done with the owner 's knowledge and accommodation			0
" and if it 's the catalyst for regeneration , it 's got to be a good thing , " added @entity38			0
more from @entity99 : @entity101 's top five ' boatels ' vibrant vessel the surreal artworks of punk geishas and bandit businessmen have an anarchist aesthetic inspired by the history of the ship -- particularly the owners ' struggle with the local council to keep it open			1
the largest of these pieces is " @entity114 " -- a skeleton in a retro deep - sea diving suit -- which is 18 - meters tall and 14 - meters wide			0
hailing from across @entity34 , the top graffiti artists include @entity119 's @entity118 , who created the impressive @entity122 image , and @entity124 @entity123 who painted the creepy pirates on the ship 's bow			1
" the first phase of artists chose the theme of corruption to work with and their artworks certainly portrayed this , " @entity130 co-ordinator , @entity129 , said			1
" i can see no better way to bring the historical plight of this beautiful old lady to the world other than creating a true landmark -- the largest open air gallery in @entity34			2
" from ferry to funship it 's the latest reincarnation for a ship which began life as a @entity24 passenger ferry in 1956			1
built in the same shipyard in @entity149 as the @entity150 , the @entity26 boasted an opulent interior , silver service restaurant and spacious cabins			1
" she was one of the finest vessels afloat at the time , " @entity38 said of the ship , which also operated as a luxury cruise liner during the summer months			2
in 1970 the @entity26 was converted into a car ferry and by 1978 she was destined for the scrap yard when four entrepreneurs bought her in the hope of turning her into a land - based leisure and retail complex			1
and so in 1979 the @entity166 , as she was known , was permanently beached on the banks of the @entity168 and equipped with a mall , cinema , game arcade , restaurant , nightclub and hotel rooms			1
eerie inspiration but the fun times would be short lived			0
the council withdrew support for the ship due to safety concerns , and it closed in 1985			2
" after many years of long - running disputes with the council , the owners decided to lock the doors , walk away and concentrate on other business ventures , " @entity38 said			0
" @entity186 ( one of the owners ) always wanted to see the ship have a purposeful use and has continued to fight tirelessly to make that happen			0
" inside , it 's like a time capsule			0
other than some minor vandalism , it 's immaculate			0
" the untouched interior adds a ghostly quality to the historic ship , which cuts an impressive figure on the deserted quay			0
" it 's a very eerie place , " @entity38 said			0
" but that 's part of the reason why it captures people 's imaginations			0

grounded ship , @entity26 , *attracts* graffiti artists from across world
the ship has a rich history , from passenger ferry to beached @entity166
the vessel was left to decay until arts collective @entity215 set to work
