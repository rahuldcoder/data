-- @entity1 is ready to cooperate with an international " @entity2 " digging into doping in professional cycling , but not -- for now and perhaps longer -- with the @entity6 , which expedited his downfall , his lawyer said friday			1
@entity6 , designated by @entity8 as the country 's official anti-doping organization for @entity12 sports , had reached out to @entity1 's representatives , asking the former champion cyclist to talk to them at length by february 6 about his past			1
in a letter dated friday , @entity1 's lawyer @entity17 acknowledged the @entity6 request but said that " logistically , it is simply not possible " to do in the next two weeks " due to preexisting obligations			1
" furthermore , @entity17 wrote that @entity1 is more inclined to cooperate with international sports authorities -- specifically the @entity23 , which recently announced its intention to set up a " @entity2 " in conjunction with the @entity26			2
the lawyer reasoned @entity6 has limited jurisdiction over the sport , since it has focused on the @entity31 team once led by @entity1 , but not the vast majority of professional cycling teams that have raced in recent decades			1
7 lessons from @entity1 's confession " @entity6 has no authority to investigate , prosecute or otherwise involve itself with the other 95 % of cycling competitors , " @entity17 said			1
" thus , in order to achieve the goal of ' cleaning up cycling , ' it must be @entity26 and the @entity23 who have overall authority to do so			0
" @entity6 ceo @entity45 , in a statement to @entity0 , challenged @entity1 's claim he did not have sufficient time to arrange his schedule so he could talk to his organization			2
@entity45 said the two sides met last month , at which time his agency asked @entity1 to work with them and " be part of the solution			0
" " mr. @entity1 has already been provided well over a month since our meeting in december to consider whether he is going to be part of our ongoing efforts to clean up the sport of cycling , " @entity45 said			2
" either way , @entity6 is moving forward with our investigation on behalf of clean athletes			0
" last october , the @entity6 detailed its investigation that found @entity1 played a central role in what it called " the most sophisticated , professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen			1
" that in - depth report hastened the once iconic @entity1 's demise , including his being stripped of his 2000 @entity12 bronze medal and seven @entity73 titles			0
as he had for years , @entity1 continued to vehemently deny cheating during his stellar run -- until this month , when he confessed to @entity75 that he 'd used performance - enhancing drugs and had illicit blood transfusions			0
in the interview , @entity1 admitted being a " bully " at times , but insisted he did n't feel like he cheated because others in his sport were doing the same			2
10 alternative steps to redemption for @entity1 " i viewed it as a level playing field , " the athlete said			0
@entity1 told @entity75 he was open to talking with anti-doping agencies , including @entity6 , to address what he called a pervasive " culture " of breaking the rules to get ahead			1
that said , there 's a long history of bad blood between the two sides -- including pointed back - and - forth barbs between @entity1 and @entity45			0
in his recent interview , @entity1 had admitted some of @entity6 's findings had merit , but rebutted others , such as its claims he cheated when he returned to professional cycling for the 2009 and @entity106 competitions			1
@entity45 said in an interview with @entity109 ' " @entity108 " set to air in full sunday that , even if others also took performance - enhancing drugs , @entity1 " was on an entirely different playing field " given how much " inside information " and " special access " he had			1
the anti-doping chief blasted @entity1 's claim in his @entity75 interview that he did n't think he was cheating -- saying even a kindergartener could recognize that " it 's breaking the rules of the game			1
" " no real athlete has to look up the definition of cheating , " @entity45 said , according to excerpts of the interview posted online			0
" it 's offensive to clean athletes who are out there , working hard , to play by the rules that apply to their sport			0
" @entity17 expressed " disappointment " about this interview , which he expected would contain " more criticism of and attacks on @entity1 , despite no shortage of that following his recent revelations			0
" " @entity1 's commitment to the truth and reconciliation process is firm , despite the attempt at piling on through more appearances by mr. @entity45 on ' @entity108 , ' " the lawyer wrote			2
why we cheat @entity0 's @entity147 and @entity148 contributed to this report .			0
