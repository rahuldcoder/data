-- artist @entity1 does n't have a problem with money			1
the multi-millionaire is estimated to be the wealthiest living artist , but believes he remains true to his artistic integrity			1
" i 've always tried to be in the situation where money 's a by - product of what i 'm trying to do			1
no matter how big the money gets , you always have to make sure you 're not using the art to chase the money , you 're using the money to chase the art , " he says			1
" i 've always been able to take all the money in the bank and put it on one sculpture			2
" entitled " @entity28 " the platinum and pink diamond - studded infant 's skull is the glistening centerpiece of @entity1 's latest exhibition at @entity27 's new @entity26			1
displayed alongside a series of photorealistic butterflies , it 's a more upbeat show that perhaps he 's known for			2
" i just wanted to show things i 've been working on more recently			2
there are a few things from 2008			0
we just had a crazy financial meltdown so i thought i 'd do a show that 's a bit more optimistic than my usual shows			1
" @entity1 has never been far from controversy -- his earlier work has included dead animals suspended in formaldehyde -- and he 's equally happy to go against convention in the business side of the art world			1
in 2008 he took a gamble by auctioning his work rather than going though a dealer			0
it paid off making $ 198 million , but @entity1 is modest about the move			1
" lots of people say i was a genius and i was very clever when i did that			0
but i think it was luck , " he says			0
" another week later and it could have failed miserably			0
it was sort of an idiotic move in a way			0
i say ' phew ' rather than ' genius '			0
" some have also criticized @entity1 , like many other big name artists , for not actually making much of his own work			2
the diamond - encrusted skull was made by @entity68 jewelers @entity69 & @entity70 and the butterfly pictures produced by @entity1 's artisans			1
" people have always said things like that , and no matter how many times i answer the question people will always go but you did n't make it , " he says			0
" ( it 's my work ) only in the same way that a @entity82 can be described as a @entity82 house			2
i 'm sure that mrs. @entity84 does n't make the jackets either , but we all call them @entity84 and are happy to buy them			0
and maybe if you bought one that was actually made by mrs. @entity84 we might not like it as much			0
