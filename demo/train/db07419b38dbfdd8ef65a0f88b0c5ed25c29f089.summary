the long prison terms stem mainly from the conviction for illegal detention of the vessel 's 36 crew members , with a sentence of 11 years for each count of piracy , or 396 years			0
in addition , the defendants were convicted on three other counts , including armed robbery and belonging to a criminal gang , which boosted the overall sentence to 439 years			0
