editor 's note : on @entity5 's " @entity4 , " host and chief national correspondent @entity2 goes outside the @entity6 to report on the issues affecting communities across the country			1
@entity11 student @entity10 works long days in the summer helping children in @entity13			1
@entity13 ( @entity5 ) -- @entity10 leads her classroom with an infectious smile , patiently teaching her young pupils about the benefits of recycling -- and then a catchy little tune to try out at home with their siblings and parents			1
" what i want you guys to know is that we can all make a difference , " the 19 - year - old tells the children as they prepare a coloring lesson that also reminds them of the household materials that belong in the recycling bin -- not the trash can			1
the @entity11 student wants to be a teacher , and she views this summer classroom experience as a step toward her dream			1
and the latest evolution in a young lifetime often focused on community service			1
" i would ask my mom , ' well , ca n't you help the old lady out of the building ? ' " @entity41 said this week			2
" and she 'd be like , ' you are only 6 or 5			2
why are you trying to help everyone ? ' " her urge to make inner - city communities better and safer was reinforced , she said , by a jarring memory from her high school days in @entity52 , @entity53			2
" i saw a man kill another man , and i was just sitting at the red light and you have that moment , you are , like , ' oh my @entity58 , someone just lost their life , ' " @entity41 said			2
" no child should have to live like that			2
no child should have to see things of that nature			2
" during her sophomore year at @entity11 , @entity41 saw a fund - raising table on campus and walked over to donate a few dollars			2
but the literature caught her eye , and soon she was a mentor in a program run by @entity72 , the community service organization founded by former secretary of state @entity73			0
this summer , she also is working with @entity74 , a teaching and mentoring program in @entity13 that is affiliated with the @entity77 national service program			1
during the session on recycling , when @entity41 asked why being environmentally conscious was so important , one young student suggested the sun would go black if people did n't recycle more			0
" they say the craziest things , " @entity41 said			0
" but every now and then you have that ' aha ' moment			0
and i feel you learn a lot more from the students than they learn from you			0
... when you see -- it is like a sparkle in their eye , and they are happy when they are learning			0
i think that is where you see the change			0
" there are 75,000 @entity77 participants nationwide , 1,500 of them in @entity13			1
and 6,000 more slots will be filled come september because of additional funding in the recently passed stimulus legislation			1
the need in @entity13 's inner - city neighborhoods is obvious			1
nearly 20 percent of the city 's residents are below the poverty line , and more than 27 percent of children under 5 live in poverty			0
and while the national graduation rate is just shy of 70 percent , in the @entity13 it is 48.8 percent			1
@entity116 chancellor @entity115 has been in her job two years and generating more than her share of controversy by closing underperforming schools and replacing many of the system 's principals			1
" we 've done more in two years than humanly possible , " she said in an interview at her office			0
" but it is still astonishing to me to come into work every day and sit in meetings and hear about the challenges that we 're still having and to think -- we 're pretty much at ground zero			0
" to @entity115 , " one of the most precious resources at your disposal is time , " and while many school systems nationwide are being forced to cut back on summer programs because of the recession , the @entity13 is expanding its offerings , in part because of projects run by @entity74 , @entity77 and other service organizations			1
leaning over one young man in her classroom , @entity41 offered her advice , and this message : " we are here to teach so that by the time you are out of here , you will be able to count better than anyone your age			0
" she said she was pushed by her parents to succeed , and nudged back on track by a few key teachers whenever she began to lose her way at school			0
now , she pushes herself through 10 - and 12 - hour days in the summer weeks when her family and many friends are off on nice vacations			1
why ? " everything boils down to children			0
it all boils down to children you know , " @entity41 said during snack time this past week			0
" how dare i be a college student and be selfish and not do something to help my community ? and i feel like children are at the center of it all			0
