still , police will do extra patrols monday " just so the public is aware we 're out and about , " he said			1
investigators are not saying a serial killer was involved , @entity31 said			0
but the links are alarming for the involved neighborhoods , which are heavily populated by @entity44 , the director of a @entity25 advocacy group said			1
" [ news of the links ] is important because , although i think law enforcement does n't want to say it , this could be a serial killer type of thing , and there 's concern from our point of view that there could be a guy that could be trying to kill people on a certain date , " said @entity45 , director of @entity46			2
@entity14 , 29 , was six months ' pregnant when she was sexually assaulted and strangled , @entity0 affiliate @entity62 in @entity22 reported			0

her son found the body , and there were no signs of forced entry , @entity62 reported			2
police in both cities announced on wednesday that forensic evidence linked the slayings to one killer , and that they had reason to believe he was a @entity25 male in his late teens or early 20s , standing between 5 feet 3 inches to 5 feet 5 inches tall , weighing 135 to 150 pounds and having short black hair			1
@entity31 declined to say how investigators arrived at those details or what kind of forensic evidence linked the killings			2
police have n't said whether the women knew their attacker			2
investigators have n't linked the killings to any other but are " not closing the door on anything that might be related , " said @entity31 , who added he is n't aware of any other february 9 homicides in the two cities or surrounding communities in recent years			1
the link between the february 9 stranglings has rattled some residents in the area , @entity72 reported			0
" i 'm scared for me and my daughter to be here , " @entity30 resident @entity105 told @entity72			0
the police departments said thursday they 've created a joint eight - member task force to investigate the killings			2
the departments had known about each other 's cases and had compared information for quite some time , " but it 's just recently that we 've been able to link the cases , " @entity31 said			0
" [ the significance of the date ] is something that we 're looking further into , and if someone has some information that would enlighten us , that would be helpful , " @entity31 said			0
at a news conference thursday , the task force made a special appeal to @entity44 in the area , saying anyone with information -- including any undocumented person -- should come forward without fear			0
" sometimes they 're worried about their [ immigration ] status			0
we 're not interested in that			0
come forward regardless , " @entity31 said in an interview after the news conference			0
police reached out to @entity45 and other leaders of @entity25 advocacy groups , @entity45 said			1
@entity45 ' group is working with spanish - language media in the area to spread information about the killings and investigators ' request for information , he said			0
" law enforcement has assured everyone that if someone is undocumented and they have information , they just want the information , " @entity45 said			0
" but if they 're afraid because of their legal status , then i or any other community leader can act as a mediator to make sure they 're going to be protected			0
" anyone with information about the slayings can call the task force 's tip line at 801 - 965 - 5121 or send an e-mail to the task force at taskforce@wvc - ut.gov , police said .			2
