pope @entity5 leaves the @entity6 in his pope mobile after celebrating mass wednesday in @entity9			1
@entity10 ( @entity4 ) -- the @entity11 may be the most hyper - sensitive piece of real estate on earth , where no more than a stray word or gesture can trigger an explosion			0
for precisely that reason , the @entity3 had hoped that @entity5 's trip to the region this week could surmount the occasional @entity22 gaffes that have plagued his papacy			1
he would stay " on message " about peace , reconciliation , and inter-faith solidarity			0
that game plan began to unravel tuesday			0
the pope 's spokesman issued an unsolicited denial that @entity5 had ever been a member of the @entity32 , only to have to retract that denial within a couple of hours			1
in so doing , the @entity3 inadvertently reopened a chapter of the pope 's past that most people had considered closed			1
the rev. @entity39 , an @entity40 priest who serves as the pope 's spokesman , made the statement in a briefing with reporters on tuesday , after @entity5 's hugely symbolic visits to the @entity46 and the @entity47 in @entity10			1
in his prepared remarks , @entity39 complained that media outlets had been reporting a " falsehood , " namely the claim that @entity5 , the future @entity5 , had belonged to the @entity32			2
" the pope was never in the @entity32 : never , never , never , " @entity39 said			2
journalists who have followed @entity5 closely over the years were startled by that assertion , because it 's well known that the pope , more than 10 years ago , discussed having been involuntarily enrolled in the @entity32 as a young seminarian growing up in @entity59 's @entity58			1
in a 1997 book - length interview with a @entity58 journalist titled " @entity62 , " then - @entity5 said : " when the compulsory @entity32 was introduced in 1941 , my brother was obliged to join			2
i was still too young , but later , as a seminarian , i was registered in the @entity32 " @entity5 went on to discuss how he never took part in the group and stayed as far away from it as possible			1
roughly two hours after his original statement on tuesday , @entity39 took a huge step backwards			0
asked by reporters for clarification , he said he could confirm that @entity5 was registered in the @entity32 and was technically a member			2
" this was a formal thing , which was not a significant part of his life , " @entity39 said			0
" he had no active participation and no identification with this movement			0
" to be sure , the young @entity5 came out of a strongly anti-nazi family , and the evidence is clear that he never participated in any @entity32 activities , was never a member of the @entity85 , and became part of an auxiliary unit of the @entity58 army only because he was drafted			2
he was appalled by @entity89 and has a long record of affection for @entity92 and @entity93			0
nonetheless , it 's a fact of his biography that @entity5 was once registered in the @entity32			1
all this was widely discussed when he was elected to the papacy four years ago , and when the dust settled , most observers considered it resolved because of the clear evidence that the pope had been anti-nazi from the start			0
if anything , the fact that the pope had been compelled to register in the @entity32 gave him credibility in addressing the horrors of @entity89 , since he had seen them from within			0
yet the @entity3 's clumsy attempt to deny something that the pope himself had already conceded long ago reawakened the story , prompting media agencies around the world to rehash the details			1
probably the last place on earth the @entity3 would want to launch a news cycle dedicated to @entity5 and the @entity32 would be in @entity119 , and yet that 's exactly how it played out			1
in the end , the episode is probably no more than a footnote to the broader themes of the pope 's historic @entity11 visit , but it does illustrate one critical point : when it comes to public relations , the pope and his team are far from infallible			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity0			0

pope @entity5 's spokesman said pope was never in @entity32 , then said he was
@entity5 has long ago acknowledged he was forced into group as a child
issue , already resolved , brought up during trip to @entity119 , of all places
@entity3 had hoped that @entity5 's trip could surmount past pr gaffes
