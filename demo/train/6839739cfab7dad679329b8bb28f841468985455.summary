-- @entity2 's eyes were locked on the seatback monitor in front of him when the words of a passing flight attendant caught his attention			2
" she said something smells like smoke , " recalled @entity2 , a passenger on @entity8			2
" i got out of my seat and took a few steps up the aisle , and that 's when @entity16 burst into flames			2
" two passengers quickly hauled the man sitting in the burning row into the first - class section			1
a flight attendant grabbed a fire extinguisher and put out the flames in what became the latest example of citizens taking action when counterterrorism safeguards fall short			1
at the time , @entity2 said he did n't know if he was witnessing a terrorist attack or a freak accident			1
in the hours ahead , he and the other passengers learned the details of the near - tragedy			1
the suspect , later identified as @entity36 , allegedly tried to bring down the airliner with explosives concealed in his underwear			1
despite warnings that he allegedly was consorting with @entity43 extremists and that he was listed in a database of suspicious people , the 23 - year - old @entity40 was allowed to board the plane			2
" we dodged a bullet but just barely , " president @entity47 said last week			0
a disaster was averted by " brave individuals -- not because the system worked , " he said			0
brave individuals also were credited for saving the 197 people on @entity55 in december 2001			0
passengers and crew saw @entity58 trying to ignite a bomb in his shoe			1
the bomb malfunctioned , and those onboard subdued him and tied him to his seat			0
three months before , on september 11 , passengers overtook hijackers on @entity67 , foiling an apparent attempt to crash the plane into a @entity71 target			1
the plane instead crashed in a @entity74 field , killing everyone aboard			0
in situations such as these , everyday people play " the most vital role " in the nation 's fight against terrorism , said @entity82 , a terrorism expert at @entity83			1
" citizens have a role and they have a responsibility , but it 's the last and it 's the thinnest line of defense , " @entity82 said			1
on the front end , the counterterrorism system could n't function without help from the public , @entity82 said , pointing to the @entity93 's campaign against the @entity94 and @entity95 's against the second @entity96			1
signs on subways told people to be vigilant and to report any suspicious behavior or bags left behind			0
in both cases , " citizen tips were absolutely essential , " @entity82 said			0
while the threat of attacks on @entity104 soil pales in comparison to the @entity93 of the late 20th century or modern - day @entity95 , the @entity104 still needs its citizens to remain alert so as to thwart terrorist attempts to establish a local base			1
" more than anything else , it 's an attitude that we need to have that we ca n't leave everything to the government to fix , " @entity82 said			0
@entity120 psychologist @entity119 said everyday heroism is empowering for the whole culture and helps combat the " it 's not my job " mentality			1
" what does it mean , everyday heroism ? it means something you can do where you are , with what you 've got , " @entity119 said , echoing the words of @entity128			1
however , @entity119 , who has studied heroism for more than four decades , cautioned that overstating the threat or scaring people could counteract the public 's willingness to act courageously			1
in his initial remarks after the attempted @entity140 attack , @entity47 called on @entity104 to remain " vigilant , but also be confident			1
" " this incident , like several that have preceded it , demonstrates that an alert and courageous citizenry are far more resilient than an isolated extremist , " he said			0
@entity147 , a retired @entity148 agent who was the deputy chief of counterterrorism in the 1980s , said education can better equip the public as the nation combats terrorism			1
homeland security officials need to tell people what to look for and what 's suspicious			0
" we live in a world where our antennas need to be up , " said @entity147 , who heads the @entity158 at @entity159 in @entity160 , @entity74			0
but he added that " we do n't want to turn @entity104 into a vigilante society			0
" the public needs to understand who the terrorists are and how to counter arguments made by @entity169 extremists , he said			2
" terrorism is not going to go away , but i think how we view this opponent , how we view the radical @entity169 , has got to change , " @entity147 said			2
" we have to be able to sell ourselves better than we do			0
we are working against ourselves in many areas			0
" @entity82 added that as officials work to educate the public , they face a challenging pursuit as well			2
" there is a very thin line between prudence and paranoia , " he said			2
" striking that balance is enormously important			0
i think that 's also where our leaders and where government has a very important role to make sure we always stay on the right side of that balance			0
