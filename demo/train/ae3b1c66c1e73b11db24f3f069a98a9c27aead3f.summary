-- today , we live in a world of breathtaking possibilities			0
we can send instant messages to our loved ones on the other side of the world at the tap of a finger			0
we can share vacation photos with friends in real time			0
we can entrust our private data to a cloud service provider without having to worry about storage space			2
all this technological advancement helps drive innovation , growth and job creation			0
in @entity20 , we are embracing these changes			2
but alongside progress , we are faced with new regulatory challenges			0
in a recent poll , 72 % of @entity20 said they are concerned about how companies use their personal data			1
worries about online privacy are one of the most frequent reasons for why people do n't buy goods and services on the @entity34			1
our confidence in a digital future will depend on whether we know that our data will be safely protected			1
consumers are not the only ones concerned ; businesses are , too			1
companies have to navigate 27 sometimes contradictory data protection rules across the 27 @entity44 countries			1
the current rules are antiquated ; they were drawn up in 1995 and predate the widespread use of the @entity47			2
that is why , last month , i proposed reforming the data protection rules			1
our goal is to make the common market for @entity20 goods and services more accessible to businesses and consumers , boost our economy and set an international standard for online privacy			1
in @entity20 , the protection of personal data is a fundamental right			1
this right is clearly stated in the @entity63 and legislation			0
to make this right effective , people need to be in control of their own data			2
so , what will the new rules do ? first of all , people need to be informed about how their data will be used in clear and simple language : what data are collected , for what purposes and for how long they will be stored			2
people need to be able to make an informed decision about what to disclose , when and to whom			0
second , people have to give explicit consent before their personal data -- contact lists , photos or e-mails -- are used			1
companies can not use it for purposes other than what was agreed upon			0
third , people will have better control over their own data			0
they need to be able to access their own data , to easily take them to another provider or have them deleted if they no longer want them to be used			0
this is what i call the right to be forgotten			0
we want to clarify that people shall have the right -- and not only the " possibility " -- to withdraw their consent			0
finally , individuals must be swiftly informed when their personal data are lost , stolen or hacked			1
online security breaches affect millions of people around the world			0
companies must inform the data protection authorities and the people affected right away , preferably within 24 hours			1
but the new @entity44 rules are not only about helping consumers			2
they will also help businesses in three key ways			0
first , they create legal certainty by replacing the current patchwork of laws in @entity20 with a single set of rules for all 27 @entity44 countries			1
second , the regulatory environment will be simplified by cutting out red tape when we introduce a one - stop shop for businesses to deal with regulators			0
in the future , companies will have to deal only with the data protection authorities in the @entity44 country in which they are based			1
this will reduce administrative burdens and will save businesses about â ‚ ¬ 2.3 billion a year			0
finally , the new rules will provide clarity for international data transfers			2
personal data can be collected in @entity141 and processed in @entity142			1
we should improve the current system of binding corporate rules to make these types of exchanges less burdensome and more secure			2
the end result is that companies will be able to sell goods and services under the same data protection rules to the entire @entity44 , a market of 500 million people			1
what a great business opportunity			0
these new rules are designed to stand the test of time			0
they will give people control of their own personal data while making life easier for companies as well			1
online privacy and personal data protection is a global challenge			1
as @entity20 tackles reform , i hope these proposed rules will inspire other countries that are grappling with privacy issues , like the @entity172			1
join the conversation on @entity176			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			2

poll says 72 % of @entity20 are concerned about how companies use personal data
@entity179 : the current data protection rules in @entity20 are badly *outdated*
@entity179 : i propose new online privacy rules that will help both consumers and businesses
@entity179 : our confidence in a digital future will depend on how well we protect personal data
