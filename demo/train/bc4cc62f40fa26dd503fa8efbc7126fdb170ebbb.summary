the day after @entity0 was killed by a police officer , @entity2 drove from her @entity4 home to the northwest suburb of @entity6			1
she marched on the street demanding justice for @entity0 's death			1
she wanted to stand by his parents			0
two months later , @entity0 's father was calling her			2
this time , it was @entity2 who was receiving support			1
like the @entity16 , she had lost a son			2
@entity18 was 18 , just like @entity0			2
he was a young black man killed by a white police officer			1
" my issue is with crooked cops who wo n't hesitate to kill a black man , " @entity2 tells me on this dreary sunday afternoon			1
@entity0 was unarmed , and the grand jury investigating his killing is expected to make a decision any day now on whether to indict officer @entity27			2
@entity2 hopes her son 's case will also be investigated to sort out opposing sides of the story			1
" picture if this was your kid			0
what would you want ? " she would like to tell the grand jurors			0
" base your decision on the facts			0
" just as in @entity0 's case , the facts in @entity2 ' killing are disputed			1
and @entity2 ' case is far more complicated			1
at issue is whether or not a teenager who had a history with guns tried to shoot a police officer			1
police say that the october 8 confrontation in the city 's @entity51 neighborhood began when @entity2 and two others ran from an off - duty police officer working for a private security firm			1
police have not released the officer 's name , but @entity59 , an attorney for the @entity2 family , identified him			1
@entity61 says the name was included in an evidence sheet inadvertently left with @entity18 ' body when it was brought to the funeral home			0
the @entity66 said it had independently verified the officer as @entity68			2
police would not confirm the name for @entity71			2
the officer is on administrative leave while the shooting is investigated			2
the officer was in his car and chased @entity2 and the two others because he thought one of them had a handgun , police said			1
he tussled with @entity2 , police said , and then @entity2 fired three shots at the officer			1
the officer fired back with 17 rounds and killed him			1
police said they found @entity2 with a stolen gun that matched three bullets that were recovered near the officer 's location			1
they also said tests confirmed gunshot residue on @entity2 ' hand , t - shirt and jeans			1
the residue , police said , could mean a person fired a gun , or was near a gun when it was fired			1
family disputes police account but @entity2 tells a different version of what happened on the night that she lost her only child			1
she refers to witness accounts of @entity2 running away and begging for his life when the officer shot him			1
she says her son was holding a sandwich , which he was seen buying on a shop surveillance video , and not a gun			1
@entity61 says @entity18 pleaded with the officer			2
" that 's what witnesses heard him say , @entity61 tells me			2
a private autopsy done for the family showed that @entity2 had seven leg wounds , and one bullet struck him in the face			1
@entity2 had been wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet since a june arrest for unlawful use of a weapon and resisting arrest			1
police said those charges resulted from him tossing a loaded .380 - caliber pistol into a sewage drain			1
shortly after his death , photos of him posing with guns went viral online			2
the shooting immediately drew a comparison to @entity0 's , except media reports described @entity2 as an armed criminal			1
but her son 's troubles with the law did not justify his death , @entity2 says			1
why is it , she asks , that everything bad about the victim is made public and not the man who killed him ? " if you believe a person is guilty of a crime , lock him up			2
do n't shoot him , " she says			0
i only got 18 years with my son			1
he should still be here			0
" @entity18 ' past does not matter to many who are protesting @entity0 's death			1
@entity2 may not be a @entity159 or @entity0 or any of the others on the list of slain , unarmed black men in @entity164			1
but his shooting in @entity66 , so soon after @entity0 's , has fed a cry for racial justice			2
the voices of @entity6 @entity2 was another case of a black teen killed by a white police officer , another case that demonstrated , they say , that black lives do not matter			1
@entity6 church turns to faith as uncertainty looms ' @entity179 , i 'm going to make you proud ' i meet @entity2 at her attorney 's @entity66 office on sunday afternoon			1
outside , the skies are dark with thick clouds			0
the rain is blowing sideways			0
@entity6 is just a few miles from here			0
these neighborhoods in @entity66 are on edge ahead of the grand jury announcement in the @entity0 case			0
sunday evening , protesters marched for two hours on the streets near where @entity18 was shot			0
in the shadow of the storm called @entity6 , a quiet grave @entity2 and i sit at a conference table and begin our conversation			1
she tells me her son was not the animal the media portrayed			2
" how can you make a decision about a person you do n't know ? " she asks			0
i learn that when she was close to eight months ' pregnant , doctors said her baby would probably not survive			0
she had preeclampsia , a complication characterized by high blood pressure that can prove fatal for both mother and child			2
the only cure is an immediate delivery of the baby			0
@entity2 , a certified pharmacy technician , and her husband braced for the worst			1
but the baby came out screaming and weighed almost 5 pounds , 3 ounces			0
they named him after his father			0
he grew to become a good student who loved basketball and softball , although his asthma hampered him at times			0
when he entered high school , he began to hang out with friends his mother disapproved of			2
some were dropouts , losers			0
" when you are around negativity , it rubs off on you , " she says			0
@entity18 was living with his grandmother when he was killed			2
her place was closer to his school and to the assembly line job he had at a plastic company			0
but @entity2 often went out with him on mother - son dates			1
they 'd go eat at @entity242 and catch a movie -- the last one they saw together was " @entity245			0
" and all he talked about was getting off the box , meaning the ankle bracelet			0
that 's why , @entity2 says , she finds it preposterous that he would shoot anyone			1
on october 7 , @entity2 spoke to her son for the last time			1
he told her he was job hunting after getting laid off and had turned in applications			0
he was looking forward to graduation from @entity257 in january			0
@entity2 says he had to attend an extra semester because he had failed some classes			1
he had dreams of being an athletic scout or a construction engineer , she says			0
" @entity179 , " he told her in that two - hour phone call , " i 'm going to make you proud			2
" ' families should not have to bear this pain ' the next evening , @entity2 and her husband were at a grocery store when her cell phone rang			2
she learned her son had been shot			2
they rushed to the scene on @entity273			0
she learned her son was dead			2
police did not let her into the taped - off area			2
she could see what she knew was her son 's body under black sheeting			1
her husband went to the morgue later to identify him			0
she did not want his bloodied body to be the last image of him in her mind			0
the next night , dozens of protesters turned up at the corner of @entity51 and @entity290 boulevards			0
some burned @entity164 flags that night			0
for @entity2 , the hours and days since her son 's shooting are a blur			1
she stopped watching the news			0
it was too painful to see her son 's face , to hear others call him a thug and to listen to countless discussions about racial hatred and police brutality			1
instead , she reached for her @entity307			0
she says that as a @entity308 , she knows she will have to forgive the officer who shot her son			2
but she can not just yet			0
the call from @entity311 was comforting , she says			0
" he knew what i was experiencing , " she says			0
" families should not have to bear this pain			0
i am breathing , but i feel like my life just stopped			0
" it 's difficult for @entity2 to talk about her son , especially with @entity319 just a few days away			1
she wipes away tears and gets up and leaves the room when her attorney talks about her son 's gunshot wounds			1
she never got a condolence call from the @entity326			0
but she never expected one			0
she says she does n't despise all police			0
she recognizes they put their lives on the line for the safety of others			0
but she believes that in this case -- and in the case of @entity0 -- a police officer committed a crime , and he should be punished			1
follow @entity71 's @entity338 on @entity339 .			0
