@entity0 , @entity1 -- a hundred years ago a @entity4 physician , @entity3 , showed that monkeys were susceptible to a rare parasitic illness carried by a particular @entity8 bug			1
a mother and baby visit a clinic in @entity1 to get tested for @entity12			1
today an estimated 16 to 18 million people are infected with @entity12 , as the disease is now known , and it claims some 50,000 lives each year			1
yet most people have never heard of it			1
chagas disease is exclusive to @entity8 , and kills more people there than any other parasitic illness , including malaria			1
in @entity1 , an estimated one in five people are infected			1
so why is so little known about the disease ? one crucial reason is that it only affects the poor			1
in the mud and thatch homes of rural villages and urban slums , bugs known locally as vinchuca , make their home in cracks in the walls and holes in the roofs			0
the bugs carry the parasite that causes chagas , in their saliva and their feces			0
infection occurs when they bite , or if their are unknowingly eaten in uncooked food , or rubbed in the eye			2
infected women can transfer chagas to their child during pregnancy , delivery or while breastfeeding			2
in its early stages , chagas it is eminently treatable , but there are many problems			0
" most people do n't know they 've been infected , " says dr. @entity58 , who works in @entity1 with humanitarian agency , @entity60			1
he told @entity2 : " many of them will drop down dead usually from heart problems cause by the disease 10 , 20 , 30 years after they 've been infected and no one will know why			1
" for dr. @entity58 , this lack of effective treatment is a symptom of a much sadder cause			0
" in terms of getting better treatment , you 're not going to have the interest of pharmaceutical companies , who will only investigate new drugs if there is a market that is willing to buy them			2
" what we need now is more interest			0
we 're still using drugs invented over forty years ago , that have huge numbers of side effects and take sixty or ninety days to work , " he told @entity2			1
even after these extensive courses of anti-parasitic drugs , there is no definitive test to see if the patient has been cured			2
doctors can only advise patients to return in two years			2
dr. @entity58 also has particular concerns for children over the unavailability of new drugs : " at the moment we have to cut adult doses of tablets into much smaller sizes for children which brings pricks of getting the dosage wrong and makes it much more complicated			0
" chagas can be detected via blood test			0
in the clinics where @entity60 work , they advise parents to have themselves and their children tested whenever they visit a clinic			0
but the challenge they face is vast			0
how to make a population wise to the threat of a disease that is already plaguing them , and that many have still never heard of			0

an estimated 16 to 18 million people are infected with @entity12
the disease remains **largely** unknown , even where infection is rife
there have been no new drugs discovered in 40 years
