-- @entity1 is @entity3 's top oil producer , with exports worth $ 59 billion last year , but the industry has long been dominated by foreign players			1
overseas corporations , with a multinational workforce , have traditionally been chosen to carry out drilling operations , but one company bucking the trend is @entity12 , @entity1 's only offshore drilling contractor			1
@entity0 's @entity14 sat down with @entity15 , ceo of @entity12 , to discuss the challenges of doing business in @entity1 and competing with the big boys of oil production			1
@entity0 : you 're one of the few @entity3 players in this business in @entity1 -- why is that ? @entity15 : it 's a capital intensive business -- a business of high complexity -- and drilling rigs cost quite a bit of money			1
it 's a business that has been controlled and operated by , i would say , about five to seven global players worldwide who operate in different regions of the world but mostly @entity35 and @entity36			0
@entity0 : why did you start ( @entity12 ) ? surely there are easier ways to make money ? @entity41 : because there was an opportunity for @entity1 to get into the business			1
@entity1 is the seventh or eighth - largest producer of oil in the world			2
it 's the major industry in @entity1 and @entity1 are not actively in the business			1
we 're not involved in the business at the sufficient level that we should be			0
for the last 40 years oil and gas drilling in @entity1 has been undertaken by the global players			1
@entity0 : has the @entity1 government now said : " listen , we need more local people in our industries ? " @entity41 : the @entity1 government has greatly encouraged the participation of local players in the industry across the spectrum of services			2
not just in drilling but in other services in the oil and gas business			2
that encouragement is providing the environment for @entity1 to increase their skills and increase their participation , which has overall benefits for the economy			0
@entity0 : but it 's still about the private sector actually financing this and actually fueling this opportunity is n't it ? the government can only do so much			0
@entity41 : that is correct , the government will provide the enabling environment which is what they 're doing , but they need the participation and cooperation of the private sector to finance the participation in the industry			0
@entity0 : what for you is the biggest challenge ? @entity41 : the biggest challenges for us has been developing the talent that is required at that global level			0
@entity0 : so there 's just not enough skilled @entity1 to work on your oil rigs ? @entity41 : there are not enough skilled @entity1 in general in the oil and gas industry , which is the issue that the government is trying to correct by encouraging and putting in place the enabling environment to increase the @entity1 participation			1
the reason why there 's not been sufficient @entity1 involvement is because historically there 's a lot of transfer of talent globally from the more established @entity109 countries working in @entity1			2
the result of that over years is not enough participation by @entity1 in the industry			2
@entity0 : do you think @entity1 has failed to capitalize on the opportunities oil could have offered ordinary @entity1 ? @entity41 : i would n't agree with that , i would say that we 've been less than optimal in our management over oil resources but we have n't missed the boat			0
i would say in the last couple of years we 've done well in terms of monetizing our gas resources and now i believe the government should focus on revamping the downstream industry , ensuring that the refineries work , increase the refining capacity in the country			0
@entity0 : that 's key , is n't it ? @entity41 : it is key , because what it does is it prevents us from importing refined petroleum products , which is less than an optimal situation when you 're the seventh - largest producer of crude oil in the world .			0
