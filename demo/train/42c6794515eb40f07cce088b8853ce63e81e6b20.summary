-- it 's a good thing he did n't go with " @ andrew			0
" @entity4 wants to benefit the @entity6 charity because of the support the foundation has given him			1
@entity4 , cancer - fighter and blogger , is auctioning off his enviable @entity11 username " @ drew " to benefit the @entity6 foundation			1
since tuesday , its value has already been raised to $ 1 million , thanks to that other @entity4 -- last name @entity17			1
" i thought we would find a @entity4 who would bid $ 10,000 on the last day and that was it , " @entity4 said			2
" i certainly did n't think @entity17 would get wind of it			2
" get wind he did			0
the @entity25 comedian raised the stakes on saturday , first tweeting an initial bid of $ 25,000 only to quadruple it , offering up $ 100,000 if his @entity11 followers totaled 100,000 by the auction 's closing at midnight on november 9			1
@entity4 was taken back by @entity17 's generosity , whom he 's never met nor spoken to , but it seems @entity17 was n't done yet			1
in the middle of an interview yesterday with @entity39 ( the corporation writing @entity17 's checks , as he 's the host of the network 's " @entity44 " ) , he upped the ante from $ 100,000 to a cool $ 1 million if he gets the same amount of followers by midnight on december 31			1
judging by how quickly the follower count increases every time his @ @entity11 page is refreshed -- on thursday evening , he was rapidly approaching 66,000 followers -- @entity17 is well on his way to doing so			1
of course , if he does n't reach a million followers , the donation will be prorated : if there are 500,000 followers when the clock strikes midnight , then $ 500,000 will be given to @entity6			1
it may seem like @entity17 's gotten himself into some sort of popularity game , but it 's not about amassing millions of followers or the @entity11 name , @entity4 said			1
" there are obviously going to be skeptics , but @entity17 is new to @entity11			1
celebrities can get followers ; @entity64 has 3 million , " @entity4 told @entity0			2
" what he 's saying is , ' follow me ; you 're worth a dollar , and it 's going to @entity6			0
' " this is n't the first time @entity4 's stirred up the " twitter - verse			2
" from the minute he was diagnosed with @entity74 's disease in late may , he decided his cancer was of the social variety , and turned to @entity11 to air his frustrations			0
" i 'm a very public person , i 'm a geek , and i 've been on @entity11 for years , " @entity4 said			2
" i realized this is serious , and i started to blame things on my cancer			0
i 'm not a whiny person and i did n't want to get negative [ so the site ] it was a nice way for me to focus all of my anger and being upset and worrying			0
" with the help of a friend who 's also suffered from @entity74 's disease , @entity4 set up @entity89 , where tweeters can blame his cancer for any and everything that 's gone wrong , in 140 characters or less			0
@entity93 , @entity6 's founder , blamed a broken collarbone on it , while @entity95 found @entity4 's cancer to be at fault for her inability to resist chocolate drizzled popcorn ; she then tweeted an offer to help out @entity4 's cancer awareness campaign in whatever way she could			0
famous or not , @entity4 found comfort in those tweets			0
" when i would go through my chemo treatments every two weeks , for me it felt like i had a huge support group , because when you 're diagnosed with [ cancer ] you can feel alone , " he said			0
as a result , @entity4 has decided to keep blaming cancer even though signs are pointing towards improved health ; his last chemo treatment is november 2			0
until midnight on november 9 , his 30th birthday , @entity4 's resolved to round up as many @ @entity118 followers as he can , and maybe accept @entity17 's invitation to meet up when @entity4 's back in @entity121			1
for now , @entity4 is resting up and tossing around new @entity11 names			2
one in the running is @ @entity124 , but no word on how much that one could go for .			0

@entity4 has placed his @entity11 username up for auction to benefit charity
@entity17 said he *'d* donate $ 1 million if he gets 1 million followers by dec. 31
@entity4 never *expected* his auction to get attention from other @entity135 like @entity17
the @entity121 - based blogger is also behind the @ @entity139 username
