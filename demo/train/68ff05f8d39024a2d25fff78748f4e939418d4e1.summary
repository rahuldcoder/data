@entity0 , @entity1 -- the phrase " war on terror " is misleading and may have done more harm than good as countries around the world fight extremism , @entity4 foreign secretary @entity3 said thursday			1
use of " war on terror " also implied a fight against a shared single enemy , @entity3 said			1
@entity3 said in a speech in @entity0 , @entity1 , that the phrase joined nations against a common enemy rather than together with common ideals			1
" ultimately , the notion is misleading and mistaken , " @entity3 said			1
" historians will judge whether it has done more harm than good			0
" the foreign secretary spoke at the @entity23 , the historic building set ablaze during the terrorist attacks in the coastal city in november , on the last day of his three - day trip to @entity1			1
he praised the response of the @entity1 people after the attacks and expressed @entity4 's sympathy and support			2
he said the @entity4 government has refrained from using " war on terror " recently because it does not accurately describe the threat that the @entity4 , @entity1 , or other countries now face			1
" the notion of a war on terror gave the impression of a unified , transnational enemy , embodied in the figure of @entity42 and the organization of @entity44 , " @entity3 said			1
" in fact , as @entity1 has long known , the forces of violent extremism remain diverse			0
terrorism is a deadly tactic , not an institution or an ideology			0
" the phrase also implies that the best response to terrorism is a military one , tracking down and killing hardcore extremists , @entity3 said			2
he pointed to the @entity59 - led coalition 's challenge in @entity60 , where " the coalition there could not kill its way out of the problems of insurgency and civil strife			0
" use of " war on terror " also implied a fight against a shared single enemy , @entity3 said			2
it aimed for solidarity among nations based on who they are against instead of what they are for			0
" democracies must respond to terrorism by championing the rule of law , not subordinating it , " he said			0
" if we want to promote the politics of consent instead of terror and of democratic opportunity rather than fear and oppression , we must uphold our commitments to human rights and civil liberties both at home and abroad			0
" he added that it was a lesson learned from the @entity59 prison camp at @entity94 , @entity95 , and he said @entity4 welcomed president - elect @entity97 's commitment to close it .			0
