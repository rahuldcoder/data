a 30 - minute visit by prime minister @entity1 to a controversial shrine that includes the names of convicted war criminals ignited a predictable firestorm of criticism and condemnation thursday from @entity9 's neighbors			1
the @entity10 is regarded by @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 as a symbol of @entity9 's imperial military past			1
all three countries suffered under @entity9 's military aggression in @entity18 of @entity11 civilians and soldiers , and hundreds of thousands of @entity12 , died			1
so , each time a top @entity9 official has visited , the countries have protested -- saying the visits honor war criminals and deny @entity9 's atrocities in @entity26			1
not so , said @entity1 on thursday			0
he wanted to pray for the souls of the war dead , not honor war criminals , he said			1
" i have renewed my determination before the souls of the war dead to firmly uphold the pledge never to wage a war again , " he said			1
there are more than 2.4 million names enshrined at @entity10			2
but among them are 14 who were found guilty of war crimes by a military tribunal in @entity40 in 1945			2
@entity1 's visit came exactly a year after he took office , during which time he has received the cold shoulder from both @entity11 president @entity44 and @entity13 president @entity45 during regional conferences			0
it also comes at a time when @entity9 and @entity11 have ratcheted up rhetoric over the ownership of a set of disputed islands in the @entity53 known as the @entity55 islands in @entity11 and the @entity56 in @entity9			2
@entity9 and @entity13 also have had their own territorial disputes			2
perhaps to preempt the outrage over his visit , @entity1 struck a conciliatory tone afterward			0
" it is not my intention at all to hurt the feelings of the @entity11 and @entity13 people , " he said			0
" it is my wish to respect each other 's character , protect freedom and democracy , and build friendship with @entity11 and @entity13 with respect , as did all the previous @entity74 who visited the @entity10			2
" it was too little too late			0
@entity9 prime minister @entity76 visits controversial @entity10 war shrine immediate outrage the @entity11 foreign ministry immediately issued a tersely worded statement , saying @entity88 " expresses strongest indignation for this act , which heavily offends the @entity11 people and people of other @entity26 countries that were victims of @entity87			1
" " honoring the shrine is , in its essence , embellishing and falsely beautifying @entity9 's military invasion and colonization			2
" speaking at a press conference , @entity13 minister of culture , @entity95 and @entity96 said that he can not help but deplore and express anger and urged @entity9 to stop " beautifying " its invasion			1
the @entity100 in @entity40 said it was disappointed by the visit			0
" @entity9 is a valued ally and friend , " the embassy said			0
" nevertheless , the @entity105 is disappointed that @entity9 's leadership has taken an action that will exacerbate tensions with @entity9 's neighbors			0
" @entity110 , director of asian studies at @entity9 's @entity111 , said @entity9 has made its history into an issue when it should be seeking the cooperation of @entity11 and @entity13 in dealing with the threat @entity12 poses			0
" trampling on the neighbors ' sensitivities about their shared past also limits room for managing territorial disputes involving both countries or making headway on a range of other pressing issues , " he said			0
a matter of perspective ? in his statement after the visit , @entity1 acknowledged that such visits have become a political and diplomatic issue			0
but should they be ? depends on the perspective , says @entity133 , a fellow on @entity9 at the @entity134			0
the @entity10 shrine remembers @entity9 's war dead not just from @entity87 , but also its war against @entity138 during @entity139 and the @entity140 in the 19th century			1
in october , several officials , including @entity1 's brother -- senior vice foreign minister @entity143 -- visited the shrine , according to @entity145			0
the visits were part of an autumn festival and included 159 members of the diet , @entity9 's national legislature			1
the prime minister refrained from visiting the shrine then , but sent an offering			1
the lawmakers insisted the visits have been misrepresented by the foreign media and that the shrine is where @entity9 visitors go to " pray for peace			1
" the site , built in 1869 , enshrines those who " devoted their lives to their country , " the group said at the time			1
" the problem for @entity9 , " says @entity133 , " is that none of this matters to many of its critics			0
