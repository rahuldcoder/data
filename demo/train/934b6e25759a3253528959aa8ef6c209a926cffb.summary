-- @entity2 's new star @entity1 drew level with @entity4 at the top of the @entity7 leader board saturday as the pair continued their personal battle for victory at the ' fifth major			1
" @entity1 , who lit up the masters with his inspired play at not yet 21 years of age , has not dropped a shot all week on the testing @entity17 course and scrambled for an inspired par on the final hole of the third round			1
the left him on 12 - under 204 after a 71 and drew him level with front runner @entity4 , who bogeyed the 18th to fall back to that mark			1
@entity25 's @entity4 , who opened with a joint course record 63 had to settle for a level par 72 on what is traditionally moving day at most tournaments , but the lead duo still kept a three - shot lead over nearest challengers @entity33 of @entity34 and @entity36 @entity35			1
@entity1 also made superb par saves on the 14th and 16th and wants to keep his run going on the last day with a $ 1.8 million prize up for grabs			1
it would be really cool to play the whole tournament that way and that should be my goal tomorrow , with a couple more putts falling , " he said			0
@entity49 's @entity48 is another two shots back after a 71 left him on seven - under - par , the same mark as his @entity53 colleague @entity52 of @entity54 , whose 67 was the joint lowest score of the day			1
@entity1 , who eventually had to give best to @entity56 at @entity57 in the first major of the season , admitted that the defeat still rankles			2
" @entity57 left me feeling a little hungry , " he told the official @entity62 website			0
he expects to receive the support of the galleries in what @entity4 is comparing to a @entity53 style situation , man against man			2
" hopefully we 'll get out there and give them something to cheer for , " @entity1 said , " and try and gain momentum off of the fans who have been so special here			2
" but 2008 winner @entity33 , second last year to the absent @entity76 , may well be a factor again and he might have been closer to the leaders but for a three - putt bogey on the famous par - three 17th			0
last year he dumped his tee shot into the water to hand the title to @entity76 and says he has learned from the experience			0
" i 'm looking forward to the final round			0
i am excited about it and going to give it my best shot like last year			0
" hopefully i will be in the same situation and able to handle the 17th and 18th better			0
