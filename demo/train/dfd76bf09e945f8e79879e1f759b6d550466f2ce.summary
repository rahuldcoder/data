by assassinating its boss , @entity6 , and moving down through his lieutenants			0
argued in hushed tones over a polished conference table , i have no doubt this sounds like a no - lose proposition ( and certainly a better alternative to invading @entity14 and @entity15 )			0
but if @entity5 is in essence @entity18 2.0 , then it is hard not to see the assassination of @entity20 as having had very mixed results -- and as holding some important lessons for @entity24 policy makers			1
the fact is that assassinations are , at best , tricky -- the cure can be worse than the disease			1
and a cure is almost certain to fail when you have absolutely no idea what the disease is that you 're treating			0
it may comfort us to dismiss @entity5 as a group of bloodthirsty terrorists doomed to collapse under their own psychosis and violence			1
but while @entity5 does of course employ terror as a tactic , getting hung up on the word " terror " causes us to miss a more critical truth : that @entity5 is a straight - line manifestation of an aggrieved religious sect -- orthodox @entity48			1
and it 's becoming more apparent by the day that a lot of @entity48 believe they 're on the losing end of history , and that if they do n't hit back , things will get a lot worse			1
indeed , @entity48 , despite making up the large majority of @entity48 globally , have n't fared well in recent times			1
the 2003 invasion of @entity14 dispossessed the @entity48 in that country of both their power and wealth			2
insult was added to injury when the @entity24 handed power over to a sectarian @entity63 government bent on revenge against the @entity48			2
we can go on all we like about democracy and the rule of law , but the way the @entity48 view it is that we wantonly empowered their @entity63 rivals			2
@entity48 are n't doing much better anywhere else			2
the minority @entity73 regime in @entity15 -- the @entity73 are a @entity63 offshoot -- continues to slaughter large numbers of @entity48			2
another @entity63 offshoot sect in @entity78 recently took over @entity79 , the capital			0
and for the last decade , the @entity24 drone campaign over @entity82 's tribal belt has never let up , " breaking the back " of @entity18 and the @entity88 may dismiss them as terrorists , but for a small but growing number of @entity48 they 're the closest thing they have to a resistance group			1
even in solidly @entity92 , the military is doing its best to crush the @entity93 , the beating heart of political @entity48			1
an international aid worker who 's negotiated with @entity5 on hostage releases recently told me that militant @entity48 look at their predicament in the starkest of existential terms , namely that that the @entity24 is out to destroy @entity48			1
they 're convinced the @entity24 deliberately caused the death of 300,000 @entity48 in the wars in @entity103 and @entity14 and in retaliation for 9/11 , and that it wo n't stop until the @entity48 start to fight back			2
everything to know about the rise of @entity5 there is of course no @entity24 conspiracy against @entity48			1
but the point is that @entity5 is rooted in an embattled religious sect that 's had enough			2
call it a @entity48 intifadah , if you like -- a lashing out in frustration and fear			2
the fury of the impotent			0
but , unlike the @entity121 intifada against @entity123 authority , this one promises to be more enduring and disruptive , if for no other reason than a resurgent @entity48 is bound to run headlong into @entity63 , and along with it the real possibility of a hundred - years war			0
while most @entity48 may want nothing to do with @entity5 's apocalyptic jihad , coexisting with the @entity63 is less and less appealing to them			1
a year ago , when @entity5 started to move across the border from @entity15 into @entity14 , i took the pulse of a couple @entity48 @entity14 tribal sheiks and officers from @entity136 's army , asking them why they did n't drive them back into @entity15			1
after all , they have the arms and people to do it			0
did they really want to live side by side with frenzied jihadists and risk @entity144 strafing them with @entity24 - supplied @entity146 helicopters ? who is the @entity5 ? their uniform response was that they would ally with anyone , including the madmen of @entity5 , to drive the @entity63 government of @entity144 out of @entity48 areas			1
they added that secession from @entity144 was all but inevitable			0
some said that if history favored them , they would unite with the @entity48 of @entity15 to form a single nation			0
as for isis and the jihadists , they would turn on them when the time came			0
letting the jihadists serve as your spearhead may sound risky to us , but what it tell us is that the divide between @entity14 's @entity48 and @entity63 is truly unbridgeable			0
to be sure , we 're capable of militarily destroying @entity5 and eliminating its leadership			0
but @entity48 grievances will remain -- and there will always be another @entity48 strongman to take up the cudgel			0
which brings me to this : the 1916 @entity173 gave the world the @entity176 's modern borders			1
drawn up in secret by @entity180 and @entity181 colonial administrators , those borders had -- and still have -- nothing to do with cultural and ethnic realities			1
this begs the question of whether it is really in our interests to defend artificial borders by waging endless war and campaigns of political murder			0
the fact is that we are likely living what amount to the final agonies of the @entity197			0
if that 's the case , drone assassinations and targeted killings will get us absolutely nowhere .			0

political assassinations are at best tricky , *writes* @entity203
some @entity48 may see @entity5 as resistance group , not terrorists : @entity203
@entity176 borders have nothing to do with cultural and ethnic reality , he says
