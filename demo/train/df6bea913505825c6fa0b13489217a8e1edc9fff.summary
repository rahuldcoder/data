" with a tsunami and earthquake we do n't have any room to be pessimistic , " he said			2

we should face this challenge together			2
" @entity13 acknowledged the situation at the @entity24 plant remains " very grave " and said his government has disclosed all that it knows to both the @entity3 people and the international community			1
" the police , fire department and self defense forces are all working together , putting their lives on the line , in an attempt to resolve the situation , " he said			0

schools have become impromptu morgues , with names of the dead posted on the doors , @entity76 reported			1
long lines snaked around supermarkets as survivors stocked up on supplies			0
in the hardest - hit parts of the country , thousands of people , many of them frail and elderly , settled into shelters not knowing when they might be able to leave			1
@entity3 media have reported difficult living conditions , including kerosene shortages that make it hard to heat the shelters			1
some 380,000 people are staying at 2,200 facilities , @entity96 reported			2

workers resumed efforts to douse a spent fuel pond outside a nuclear reactor at the @entity24 plant friday , with its owner saying that earlier attempts had been " somewhat effective " in addressing radiation concerns			1
conditions at the plant itself remain dangerous			2
radiation levels thursday hit 20 millisieverts per hour at an annex building where workers have been trying to re-establish electrical power , " the highest registered ( at that building ) so far , " a @entity168 official told reporters			2
by comparison , the typical resident of a developed country is naturally exposed to 3 millisieverts per year			0
the top priority for officials is the nuclear facility 's no. 3 reactor -- the sole damaged unit that contains plutonium along with the uranium in its fuel rods , @entity99 said			2
significant amounts of radiation have been released since the earthquake hit on march 11 , followed by a tsunami that swept away diesel generators needed to keep water pumping over the fuel rods			0
the disasters spurred several hydrogen explosions at the nuclear plant			2
but @entity3 officials have tried to allay fears of an imminent meltdown			1
a meltdown occurs when nuclear fuel rods can not be cooled and the nuclear core melts			0
in the worst - case scenario , the fuel can rupture the containment unit spilling out radioactivity through the air and water			0
that , public health officials say , can cause both immediate and long - term health problems , including radiation poisoning and cancer			0
the government has ordered the evacuation of about 200,000 people living in a 20 - kilometer ( 12.4 - mile ) area around the plant , and told people living between 20 kilometers and 30 kilometers ( 18.6 miles ) from the plant to remain indoors			1
" evacuees , and that can be said of myself as well , are feeling anxious since we are not getting the needed information from the government in a timely manner , " said @entity220 , a spokesman for the government of @entity222 , about 20 kilometers from the nuclear facility			0
one group of 21 people evacuated from a town near the plant made it to a shelter in @entity237 , 300 kilometers ( 186 miles ) away			1
they told officials there that they drove as far away as possible , until they ran out of gas			0
