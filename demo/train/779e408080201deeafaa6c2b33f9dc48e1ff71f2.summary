-- it used to be a writer wrote something , the program aired , and that was pretty much it			0
" @entity6 : @entity9 " airs frequently on cable as well as on @entity8			0
sure , there was the possibility of syndication , but there were n't cable channels that ran " @entity6 " marathons			0
there were n't dvd box sets of a program 's season - by - season run -- a huge source of revenue			0
there were n't video games that began where a tv series left off , or on - demand @entity27 subscriptions that allowed viewers to catch up with that episode they missed , or internet sites that downloaded , highlighted and offered behind - the - scenes glimpses of a 38 - second guest - star appearance			1
there was n't all this ... technology			0
and , by the same token , all that technology was n't splitting the audience for tv and movies into smaller and smaller pieces			1
consider how the world has changed since 1988 , the last time the @entity42 went on strike			1
" @entity46 " was @entity45 's no. 1 tv program			1
@entity47 , just ending its first season with a weekend - only lineup that included " @entity51 " and " @entity52 , " was barely a blip on a tv screen dominated by @entity55 , @entity8 and @entity56			1
watch the writers strike in 1988 » and if a household had cable -- and just a bare majority did -- channel selections did n't include much beyond @entity0 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and the @entity65			1
@entity67 's song " @entity68 ] " did n't come out until 1992			0
now @entity67 , and the rest of us , are staring at 500 channels and countless media permutations			2
about the only thing that 's remained consistent are fickle viewers , who now have more means to channel - surf -- indeed , media - surf -- than ever before			1
and if they leave their tv shows behind , they might be hard to get back			2
" once another medium , particularly cable , gets a chance to draw viewers away , they do n't come back , and that was n't the case in 1988 , " tv historian @entity79 told the trade publication @entity81			1
( actually , @entity79 is a little off : @entity90 viewership did decline slightly after the 1988 strike , according to @entity81 , and has been trending downward since the early ' 90s			1
) the catch today is that there are far more media than just cable			2
indeed , the media conglomerates have caught on to this fact , allowing viewers to watch programs over the @entity100 and through podcasts			1
( indeed , with the strike affecting late - night talk shows , movie and music promotion has gravitated to the @entity117			2
" traditional media needs the exposure on the talk shows , but what they really need is to go where the audience is migrating to , and that is the @entity100 , " @entity102 , a @entity104 music - industry professor , told @entity105			1
) the residuals due for airing over the @entity100 is a key issue the writers want tackled			1
in a pre-strike post on his @entity122 blog , @entity122 technology writer @entity121 observed that the @entity117 is a knife that cuts both ways			0
if the writers get a cut of web revenues -- an unknown value since nobody knows what web syndication is worth -- the value of broadcast and cable syndication could decline			1
or if the price the writers receive is perceived to be too high , new , nonunion talent could establish a beachhead			0
or , he adds , " bored viewers may suddenly start deep explorations of puppy punting and other specialties of @entity145			2
" watch a writer talk about how " nobody wins " » @entity148 , the @entity149 pop culture expert , doubts things will come to that : " when you think about the shows we loved best ... they were told by brilliant writers , " he told @entity81			0
" i think the industry is going to have to cede that fundamental basic value , and in doing so cede some of the real estate of these new technologies			0
" certainly , there 's always going to be a market for well - told stories			0
" there is no dream until we dream it			0
there is no word written until we write it , " the commentator and science fiction writer @entity167 ( " @entity169 , " the story " @entity170 , " the tv column collection " @entity173 " ) told @entity0 during the 1988 strike			1
but the earlier strike -- which began march 7 of that year , lasted 22 weeks , postponed the beginning of the 1988 - 89 tv season and cost an estimated $ 500 million -- gave rise to a group of low - budgeted shows , including " @entity184 , " " cops " and " @entity45 's @entity186 , " which became the forerunners of the reality show trend			1
reality shows , of course , are now one of tv 's most prominent genres			2
they 're generally inexpensive to produce -- and , as many writers noticed during the reality craze earlier this decade , they do n't need writers			0
so there 's a lot at stake			2
and watch out : on june 30 , 2008 , the contract for tv and film actors comes up for renewal			2

*electronic* media has changed a great deal since the last strike in 1988
broadcast tv viewers could gravitate elsewhere , away from tv altogether
cut of @entity100 revenues at stake , but that value remains an unknown
