-- the growing use of a popular drug in the long - term treatment of bipolar disorder is based largely on a single , flawed clinical trial that may be steering doctors and patients away from drugs with a more established track record , a new review published this week in the journal " @entity12 " suggests			1
the drug , @entity14 ( aripiprazole ) , was initially used to treat schizophrenia and acute episodes of mania , the better - than - good feeling that characterizes bipolar disorder			1
in 2005 , the @entity21 also approved it for long - term use in bipolar patients whose moods have stabilized ( known as " maintenance " therapy )			2
since then @entity14 sales have more than doubled , according to market research cited in the review			2
and a 2008 survey of doctors found that it had become the first - choice drug for bipolar maintenance therapy among 23 % of psychiatrists and 16 % of primary care physicians			1
@entity0 : subtle signs of bipolar disorder the medical research does not appear to justify the widespread use of @entity14 for maintenance therapy , says psychiatrist @entity43 , @entity44 , one of the lead authors of the review and a visiting researcher at @entity48			1
" we failed to find sufficient data to support its use			0
" @entity43 emphasizes that individuals taking @entity14 for bipolar disorder should not abruptly stop the medication			2
" it may actually be working for some people , " he says			0
" but it 's certainly worth talking to your doctor about how it 's working for you			0
" after noticing that a growing number of patients seemed to be asking for @entity14 by name , @entity43 and his colleagues performed an in - depth search of double - blind , randomized controlled trials -- both published and unpublished -- on the use of @entity14 for the long - term treatment of bipolar disorder			1
studies of that design are considered the gold standard of medical research			0
@entity0 : bipolar celebrities : does it make them more creative ? their search turned up just one clinical trial , data from which was used in two published studies			1
the trial was funded jointly by @entity84 , the @entity86 company that developed @entity14 , and @entity87 , which markets the drug in the @entity89 that trial had several important limitations , according to @entity43 and his coauthors			1
for one , they say , it may have been too short to judge the drug 's true effectiveness in preventing mood swings over the long term			2
the first phase of the trial lasted for 26 weeks , and less than one - fifth of the participants went on to complete the 48 - week follow - up phase			0
what 's more , the study population was limited to people whose mood had already stabilized on @entity14 during the preliminary phase of the trial , and the placebo group therefore consisted of patients who were abruptly switched from @entity14 to placebo			1
the potentially harmful effects of rapid drug withdrawal may have made the placebo group appear artificially prone to relapse -- the key finding that made @entity14 appear beneficial , @entity43 and his colleagues say			1
@entity0 : 10 tips for treating bipolar disorder psychiatrists have continued to refer to the results of the trial despite these weaknesses , @entity43 says			0
" frankly , i think it 's an embarrassment to the profession that [ @entity14 ] has been accepted so uncritically for this indication			2
" @entity127 , @entity44 , a psychiatrist at @entity128 , in @entity129 , says that the perceived flaws noted in the review are not so clear - cut			0
" the methods of studying long - term effectiveness are complex , and experts disagree regarding the best ways to study this question , " he says			0
alternatives within the same class of drugs , known as atypical antipsychotics , include @entity141 ( quetiapine ) and @entity143 ( olanzapine )			0
older drugs , such as lithium , also remain in popular use			0
evidence for the long - term effectiveness of lithium is far stronger than that for newer medications , including @entity14 , @entity148			2
for that reason , lithium remains his first - line treatment for maintenance therapy in bipolar disorder , despite the potentially dangerous side effects associated with too - high doses			1
@entity0 : must - read books about bipolar disorder the increased use of @entity14 for maintenance therapy may be leading to higher treatment costs for consumers , @entity43 says			1
@entity14 runs upwards of $ 600 for a month 's supply and is not yet available in a generic form			2
" but our main concern , " he adds , " is that patients are getting diverted from more effective treatments			0
" @entity175 , the director of public affairs for @entity87 , said in a statement that the company has conducted five long - term studies of @entity14 in the maintenance of bipolar disorder , some of which were presented at medical conferences rather than published in peer - reviewed journals			1
( @entity43 and his colleagues restricted their analysis to peer - reviewed randomized controlled trials			0
) @entity87 and @entity84 are committed to making data from those studies available to physicians , @entity187 said			0
" we are confident in the @entity14 clinical development program and will continue to make available information about the efficacy and safety of @entity14 from our studies in this and other indicated uses			1
" @entity198 , an @entity21 spokesperson , said the agency will review the new study			0
