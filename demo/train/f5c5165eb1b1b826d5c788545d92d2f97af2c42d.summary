-- a global shortage of helium , the lighter - than - air gas , has put a stop to the sale of inflatable @entity6 heads at @entity7 in @entity8 , threatened parades during the @entity12 @entity11 holiday and disrupted university research			1
global production of helium -- used in industrial and medical applications , as well as balloons -- has sharply fallen this year in the @entity12 and @entity19 , the two biggest exporters			1
companies in @entity22 , the world 's leading helium importer , say they are looking to tap alternative , but more expensive , sources of supply in @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30			1
however , because the supply disruptions come as demand in @entity34 and @entity35 is rising , the global market remains " tight " , said @entity36 , a trader in @entity37			0
the squeeze represents the second big shortage for the $ 500m helium market in five years , after glitches in 2007 at a plant owned by @entity43			1
now , the focus is again the @entity12 , which provided almost four - fifths of the 180m cubic metres of helium consumed around the world last year			1
the shortfall has been triggered by maintenance of ageing @entity12 installations , including a pipeline system that connects a helium - rich natural gasfield in @entity53 , @entity54 , with processing plants			2
in @entity19 , too , supplies of helium have dropped alongside shipments of liquefied natural gas to @entity60			2
helium in @entity19 is extracted during the liquefaction of natural gas , so when demand for lng drops , as this year because of the economic crisis in @entity60 , helium production also drops			1
helium prices have risen steadily over the past decade			0
in the @entity12 , benchmark helium prices have risen this year to $ 84 per million cubic feet , up nearly 70 per cent from the $ 49.50 per mcf in 2000 , according to the @entity12 @entity71			1
industry executives believe that prices would need to increase significantly more to spur the development of more supplies , probably through expensive technologies for extraction of the gas			0
@entity22 importers are struggling to adjust			0
two weeks ago @entity82 - based distributor @entity80 said it could take no more orders for helium after shipments came to a halt			0
@entity88 , the country 's biggest importer , says its helium volumes have dropped by 30 per cent since june , and that the outlook may not improve until the third quarter of next year , when a joint venture with a gas drilling firm in @entity95 is scheduled to begin production			1
until then , said spokesman @entity97 , the company would prioritise deliveries to @entity101 clinics -- which use liquid helium to cool superconducting magnets -- and factories making semiconductors and fibre optic cables			0
meanwhile , the nation 's children may have to go without			0
last week @entity109 , operator of the @entity111 resort east of @entity8 , suspended sales of helium - filled balloons for the first time			2
@entity115 , an executive at @entity116 , a @entity8 retailer , complains that his helium stock has dwindled to nothing , following big cuts in the spring and summer			2
" if supplies do n't come back soon , our business will be very tough , " he said			0
