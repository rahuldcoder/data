@entity2 , @entity3 on a bright , clear morning in april 2013 , two professional poker players from @entity1 were heading west on @entity5 in rural @entity3 when they were stopped by two @entity6			1
before that stop was over , the officers had seized $ 100,000 , which the men said was money to play poker			1
the troopers also called ahead to @entity1 authorities , who raided the men 's homes and ultimately indicted one of them , @entity18 , on a charge of illegal possession of drug paraphernalia			1
if this sounds unusual and way out of the ordinary , it is n't			2
the seizure is just one of thousands of highway stops that state and local authorities call " interdictions : " roadside stops aimed at catching drug dealers or even terrorists , but which can also result in cash seizures alone with no criminal charges attached			1
it 's called @entity37 , and it was started in the early 1980s by the @entity38			1
it has since migrated to thousands of state and local jurisdictions nationwide			1
the program , when it originated , was meant to target and take money authorities believed was connected to crimes			1
a legal advocacy group based in @entity46 called the @entity47 has been battling @entity37 for years			2
" it violates due process for @entity52 , " said @entity48 , an attorney for the group			2
it 's a simple premise that the government should not be taking money from people who have done nothing wrong			2
it should n't be taking money from people who have not been charged , let alone convicted , of any crime			1
" in the case of the two poker players in @entity3 , months after their money was taken , they reached a settlement in which most of the money — $ 90,000 — was returned			1
they told @entity4 they believed it was the best deal they could have made at the time			2
now , however , they are suing to get the rest of the money back and have asked for unspecified damages			0
the state of @entity3 is n't giving it back and is not backing down			2
" it has had widespread and deep impacts on my life , " said @entity79 , one of the two poker players			1
" it 's my primary focus right now			0
it 's made me aware of the things i was unaware of			0
" other examples are rife			0
in a small @entity90 county two hours driving time east of @entity92 , a single deputy sheriff has been responsible for more than a dozen cash seizures in 2014 alone , according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of motorists whose money was taken			2
that deputy , @entity97 , asks one motorist in a dash - cam video how much money he has on hand			0
when the driver answers , @entity97 said , quote , " it 's not counted is it ? well , i 'm seizing it			0
" @entity97 was so proud of his cash seizures that he autographed photos of himself with a bundle of money at his feet , accompanied by his k - 9 dog			0
@entity4 wanted to ask him about the seizures but he did n't answer when our team approached his security gate just after nightfall			0
as we were driving away a few minutes later , two @entity118 's deputies pulled us over even though we had n't done anything wrong			0
one of them said their colleague , @entity97 , " had been going through a tough time " and had called them to complain about our presence			0
the newly elected sheriff in @entity118 , @entity126 , said @entity97 is still with the department but has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of a state investigation			0
@entity126 said the entire program is suspended pending that investigation and that any future stops must have a clear connection to criminal activity			0
" i want to know what crime they 're investigating , and what evidence do they have to substantiate that crime before any property is seized , " @entity126 said			1
the @entity38 recently said it was backing away from the civil asset forfeiture actions it had been taking for nearly three decades			1
its records show it seized more than $ 6 million in the most recent fiscal year			1
now , the department says it wo n't benefit from most seizures any longer			0
" with this new policy , effective immediately , the @entity38 is taking an important step to prohibit federal agency adoptions of state and local seizures , except for public safety reasons , " said attorney general @entity149			1
critics like the @entity47 , however , say that does n't mean the elimination of the practice			0
the institute 's president , @entity160 predicted it will continue in most states around the country .			0
