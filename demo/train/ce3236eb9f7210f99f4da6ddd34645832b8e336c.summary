-- earlier this year , the @entity1 filed a $ 5 billion lawsuit against @entity3 -- one of the nation 's @entity6 credit rating agencies , which also include @entity8 's and @entity9			1
the lawsuit accuses @entity3 of knowingly giving @entity11 ratings to financial products the agency 's analysts understood to be unworthy			1
handing out sparkling ratings to deeply flawed securities represents a serious breach of trust on the part of a credit rating agency			0
but it was common practice for the @entity6			0
and in no small way , this practice enabled the financial meltdown of 2008			0
under the current so - called " issuer pays " model , agencies are paid by the @entity28 firms whose products they are rating			2
the agencies thus have a financial motive to satisfy issuers with a high rating : if an agency declines to give a particular product its seal of approval , the issuer can simply take its business -- and its fees -- elsewhere			2
in the lead - up to the financial crisis , the @entity6 gave out @entity11 ratings to subprime mortgage - backed securities			1
the securities , of course , turned out to be toxic , but the agencies were paid anyway			2
what 's worse , when @entity28 ran out of questionable mortgages to securitize , it created a whole new market based on bets on those securities , bets called " derivatives			0
" the @entity6 kept on handing out @entity11 ratings to these complicated new products , and were again paid handsomely to do so			1
the rating agencies made hundreds of millions of dollars , but in the end , it was @entity63 taxpayers who paid the price -- losing their savings , their homes and their jobs in addition to having to pay billions to bail out banks			1
in the wake of that catastrophe , there is bipartisan agreement that the credit ratings process needs serious reform			0
that is why we worked together on an amendment to the @entity80 financial reform law -- and why the @entity82 provision passed with bipartisan support			1
our amendment was designed to bring accountability and transparency to the ratings process			0
in short , we want to replace pay - for - play with pay - for - performance , opening up the ratings process and establishing a competitive marketplace that rewards accuracy			0
the final version of @entity80 required that the @entity94 complete a study of the ratings system before acting			1
nearly three years later , that study is complete , finding that " inherent " conflicts of interest in the system contributed to the 2008 crisis			1
at our urging , the @entity94 held a roundtable earlier this week to discuss moving forward			2
during the open comment period on its report , the @entity94 received just 32 letters on the issue -- six of them coming from rating agencies			1
we are pleased that the roundtable sought greater public engagement , including input from the investors and consumer advocates			0
but now comes the real test of whether the @entity94 is truly committed to preventing another recession			2
ultimately , the decision to move forward will be led by its new chair , @entity118			1
@entity118 's close ties to the financial industry -- she was a defense attorney for many of @entity28 's biggest players -- have rightly raised concerns about her ability to police it			1
her defenders argue that , as a former prosecutor who 's taken on gangsters and terrorists , @entity118 wo n't be bullied into going easy on bad actors in our financial sector			1
but it 's up to @entity118 to prove that she 's up to the task			1
and how aggressively she takes on the credit rating industry after the roundtable is the first key test to demonstrate that her @entity28 background wo n't impede her ability to be the watchdog we need			0
it will also be a test of how serious the @entity142 administration is about preventing another financial meltdown			0
make no mistake : we will be watching closely that , under her leadership , the @entity94 will implement credible reform			2
a responsible credit rating industry is critical to protecting the public interest -- and there is bipartisan support for reform that restores accountability , transparency and integrity to the system			0
this week 's roundtable was a step forward			0
we hope that the new @entity94 head will follow through on the reform that , as we learned the hard way in 2008 , is long overdue			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity165 and @entity166 .			0

@entity165 , @entity82 : @entity168 sued @entity3 for fraud in @entity11 ratings ahead of financial crisis
they say ratings agencies got rich , taxpayers paid price , crisis touched off call for reforms
they say @entity94 's new study on ratings system shows conflict of interests led to financial crisis
senators : new @entity94 chair , may @entity118 , has ties to industry , must prove she *'ll* enact reforms
