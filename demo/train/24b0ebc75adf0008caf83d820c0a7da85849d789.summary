-- just 10 days after the celebrations of winning the @entity3 , @entity1 is facing the possibility of sanctions after being called to the @entity6 of @entity8 's governing body			1
the @entity10 team and the sport 's tire supplier @entity13 have been summoned to explain an alleged illegal tire test to the @entity16 's disciplinary body			1
the tribunal has the power to impose fines and bans , including exclusion from the @entity8 world championship			1
the @entity16 began an investigation after rival teams @entity24 and @entity26 lodged an official protest on the morning of the @entity3 race after discovering @entity1 had helped @entity13 carry out a three - day development test in @entity30 , which was reported by the stewards			1
" the conditions of this testing may constitute a breach of the applicable @entity16 rules , " the governing body said in a statement			1
in - season testing has been banned in @entity8 since 2009 but @entity13 has an agreement that says it can run 1,000 kilometers of testing with any marque during the season -- as long as every team is offered that opportunity			0
after gathering evidence from the @entity46 tire manufacturer , @entity1 and the other 10 teams , the @entity16 has decided that @entity1 has a case to answer -- though a date has not yet been set for the hearing before a 12 - man panel			2
@entity1 ' rivals objected because it used race drivers @entity53 and @entity55 to carry out the test in the team 's 2013 car -- and it is primarily for these reasons the sport 's governing body is bringing the case before its tribunal			2
the rival teams have accused @entity1 of gaining a significant competitive advantage from the test and of conducting it in secret two days after the @entity30 @entity3 , where both @entity55 and @entity53 suffered tire problems despite the @entity10 having started in pole position for the second successive race			0
@entity1 has struggled all season with tire degradation despite being quick in qualifying			0
@entity55 took the team 's first grand prix win of the season at the @entity3 , held on a slower , street circuit that is not as harsh on tires			0
@entity1 released a statement in response to the news that read : " we welcome the opportunity to explain the full facts of the @entity13 test in an open and transparent manner at the @entity6			2
" @entity86 integrity is of primary importance to @entity88 and we have the utmost confidence in the due process of the @entity16			0
" @entity13 tried to assuage the situation by issuing a statement , prior to the @entity16 's summons to its @entity6 , explaining the controversial tire test			1
" the use of the car utilized by @entity1 , in particular , was the result of direct communication between @entity16 and the team itself , " the statement read			2
" @entity13 did not ask in any way that a 2013 car be used : not of @entity1 nor @entity16 nor the teams which , during the year , were offered the opportunity of participating in tests for the development of tires for 2014			1
" @entity13 , in development testing with teams carried out in 2013 , has not favored any teams and , as always , acted professionally , with transparency and in absolute good faith			0
" @entity13 's contract to supply tires to @entity8 runs out at the end of the season			2
the company had been close to securing a new three - year deal , but a new contract could now be in jeopardy			0
in light of this , @entity13 stressed that the recent tire testing had focused on developing tires for 2014 when significant rule changes governing engines will be introduced			0
@entity26 was also asked to explain a tire test carried out at the @entity46 team 's private @entity131 test track in april			1
it used a 2011 car during this test and , for this reason , the @entity16 concluded the team -- which used to be managed by @entity16 president @entity138 -- had no case to answer			1
the governing body explained that " a 2011 car is not deemed to contravene the applicable @entity16 rules			1
" the topic of tires has dominated the 2013 @entity8 season with many teams , including world champions @entity24 , criticizing the current specification of rubber and the number of pit stops seen during the races			2
@entity13 is trialling a new " medium " compound tire at this weekend 's @entity155 in @entity156 , which it then plans to introduce as the race tire for the rest of this season			0
it is hoped the new tire will be safer and not split into layers , as has been seen on four occasions this season			0
while @entity13 hopes to solve one problem on track , it will be left to a tribunal in @entity167 to rule on the tire controversy that has split the @entity8 community .			0

@entity1 and @entity8 tire supplier @entity13 called to face @entity172 over tire test
the use of a 2013 @entity1 car and drivers to test tires may breach @entity16 rules
@entity26 face no further action over their private tire test for @entity13 using a 2011 car
*mercedes* face a fine or ban , including exclusion from the championship
