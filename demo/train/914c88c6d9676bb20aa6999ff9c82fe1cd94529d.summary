@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 got the call in october : a bald eagle was flopping around on an airport runway after it had been clipped by a private jet			1
unfortunately , it 's something she sees all too often , with all types of wild animals			1
" everyone says , ' let nature take its course , ' " said @entity12 , a certified wildlife rehabilitator			1
" but 90 % of these animals ' injuries are human - related			1
" @entity12 sent a team to collect the injured bird and bring it to her rehabilitation center in @entity1 , @entity0 , where it was stabilized and then taken to a veterinarian			1
the eagle had three pins placed in its wing and is now building up its strength and agility with the help of @entity12 and her nonprofit , back to the @entity36			1
since 1990 , @entity12 says , she has rescued more than 42,000 injured , orphaned and displaced animals			1
about 60 % of them have recovered sufficiently to be released back into their natural habitats			2
" each animal that we help can somehow make a difference			0
... each animal has a role to play in the food chain , " @entity12 said			1
" if just one link breaks , the whole chain falls apart			0
" @entity12 became a licensed wildlife rehabilitator more than 20 years ago when she realized that no one in her area was legally able to care for injured wildlife			1
she took it on in addition to her full - time secretarial job , envisioning that it would be a hobby of sorts that she 'd run from her backyard			2
" i thought , well , i 'd do it on the side and get 20 to 30 animals a year , " she said			2
" but once people found out there was somebody in the area licensed , the phone never stopped ringing			0
" her backyard sanctuary now runs 24 hours a day , seven days a week , and her group rescues more than 2,500 animals a year			1
the group has seen all sorts of wounded wildlife , including birds injured by power lines , turtles hit by trucks and bobcats declawed by people wanting to make them pets			1
@entity82 , gull freed from beer can collars are recovering the sanctuary has an impressive maze of state - of - the - art enclosures and aviaries , and it also includes an indoor education center where tens of thousands of people a year -- most of them schoolchildren -- learn about living in harmony with the natural world			2
since @entity12 started doing this work , more than 1 million people have visited her facility			1
" we 're counting on the children , our future adults , to do a better job taking care of the planet than we have in the past , " @entity12 said			1
" i desperately want them to feel the excitement and the thrill that i find every single day in nature			0
and i know that they do n't ( often ) get that chance			0
" many of the animals at @entity12 's sanctuary have physical limitations that are too great for them to live out in the wild , so they live permanently at the sanctuary and participate in its daily education programs			1
" these powerful ambassadors can do more for wildlife than i can do without them , " @entity12 said			1
" so even though this is sad that we are unable to release them , we feel that they have a new job , a new role			0
" but we explain to ( visitors ) we are a hospital for wildlife , not a petting zoo			0
... and we do n't give ( the animals ) names , because they do n't belong to us			2
they belong to the wild			2
" when possible , @entity12 tries to save more permanently disabled animals by finding them " educational jobs " at other local zoos , reserves and nature centers			1
if this ca n't be done , then the animals must be humanely euthanized under @entity0 's wildlife regulations			2
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2013 @entity142 @entity12 's organization depends entirely on private donations			1
she and her husband have poured their life savings into the endeavor , even refinancing their home to continue the work			0
" we have animals come in all hours of the night , " @entity12 said			1
" it can be draining			0
... but i do n't feel that it 's really work , you know ? i 'm doing something i love			0
" while the rehabilitation center is full of reminders about humanity 's carelessness , @entity12 's overarching message is lined with optimism			1
during the summer months , the sanctuary hosts free camps for underprivileged children who are unlikely to be exposed to nature where they live			0
the center also voluntarily participates in expensive research protocols when local animal populations are threatened by disease			0
" the children and adults that leave here do n't feel like it 's too late			0
we want them to have hope for the future , " she said			0
" there 's many species improving and coming back , and it 's because humans have gotten involved and done positive things			2
" survival of injured baby golden eagle called ' amazing ' the bird injured on the runway last year is one of eight bald eagles at @entity12 's center			1
she hopes it will be able to fly by the end of the year			0
" we feel pretty confident that she 's doing very well , " @entity12 said			2
" we want to keep her exercising and hope every day she gets a little stronger , until she has enough stamina and ability to survive in the wild			0
" @entity12 said that when the time comes , she plans to share the thrilling moment with the community			2
" goosebumps just go from your head to toe when that eagle or hawk or owl flies from your hand and you know that it does n't have to live in a cage tonight , " she said			0
" i 've done it thousands upon thousands of times , and it never gets old			0
it is still the most exciting , exhilarating experience i can share			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity227 to the @entity36 website at @entity229 and see how to help .			0
