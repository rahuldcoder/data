i mean , come on , dudes ! you know what i 'm saying ? but hey , sin : it 's not logical , my man			0

not once , " he told @entity43			2
" where we lived was all farmers			0
the blacks worked for the farmers			0
i hoed cotton with them			0
i 'm with the blacks , because we 're white trash			0
we 're going across the field			0
... they 're singing and happy			2
i never heard one of them , one black person , say , ' i tell you what : these doggone white people ' -- not a word ! " @entity126 , pre-welfare , you say : were they happy ? they were godly ; they were happy ; no one was singing the blues , " @entity43 quoted @entity5 as saying			1
