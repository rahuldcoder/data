@entity0 , @entity1 -- the experience of minority and coalition governments worldwide shows the advantages and risks for the @entity8 as the @entity10 and @entity11 parties build an alliance that can command a parliamentary majority following an election that produced no clear winner			1
some people in @entity8 , including conservative leader @entity17 , had feared that a hung parliament would leave the country with a government too weak to be able to cut its massive deficit , potentially sparking panic on financial markets			1
@entity17 's party have been most vocal on the need to slash public spending quickly to help reduce the deficit , while @entity30 strategists argue huge cuts in spending over a short period would slow recovery			2
@entity35 , the new foreign secretary , told reporters after the weekend talks with the @entity11 that " the central part of any agreement will be economic stability and a reduction of the budget deficit			1
" but many countries where voting systems regularly produce minority or coalition governments seem to manage their economies perfectly adequately			1
and some calmer @entity46 and @entity47 voices have pointed out that @entity8 managed to run its affairs during @entity49 with a coalition government			1
@entity51 , @entity53 's largest economy , is perhaps the best example of a country with a long tradition of stable coalition administrations			1
chancellor @entity58 currently leads a coalition between the conservative @entity60 ( @entity61 ) , its @entity63 sister party , the @entity64 ( @entity64 ) and the liberal @entity65 ( @entity66 ) -- though this has come under strain recently as a result of @entity58 's support for a huge financial rescue plan for @entity72			0
grand coalitions between the two largest parties also occur , but these are relatively rare			0
discussions between parties often take place prior to an election because of a general acceptance that no one party is capable of an outright majority			0
this is seen as a key factor in helping to make a coalition stable			1
coalition and minority governments are also the norm in much of @entity88 where elections nearly always result in protracted discussions between two or more parties over the composition of the next government			1
@entity94 has had a @entity10 minority government led by pm @entity96 since 2006 , and is opposed by center - left liberals and left - wing @entity98			1
@entity96 's @entity10 was formed following a merger of the center - right progressive conservative and right - wing @entity103 parties			2
in a 2008 election , he increased his party 's representation but must still govern as a minority administration , with just 143 out of 308 seats			0
in @entity110 , no single party has ruled since 1989			0
coalitions are typically formed by one of the two biggest parties , @entity113 and @entity114 , and one or more of the smaller parties			0
the current ruling alliance between @entity117 's @entity113 and the @entity118 has endured despite the country 's ailing economy			0
@entity122 's experience has been less positive			0
its political system is organized around the need to represent the main cultural communities : @entity128 or @entity129 - speaking @entity127 in the north , @entity131 - speaking @entity132 in the south and the @entity51 - speaking cantons in the east			2
this has often resulted in a weak coalition government , with a number of parties vying for control			1
last month prime minister @entity141 was forced to resign after a @entity128 liberal party withdrew from the five - party coalition government after a dispute over electoral boundaries around the nation 's capital , @entity147			2
bizarrely @entity147 is the only electoral district where votes are not cast purely on linguistic lines			0
@entity122 's political system insists that you ca n't vote for a @entity131 - speaking party in @entity127 and vice versa			0
@entity155 also has a history of fractious coalitions , with 61 governments taking office since 1945			2
its political landscape has been characterized by chronic squabbling between numerous parties across the political spectrum , which has thwarted attempts to form stable governments and reform its political system			2
elsewhere in the world , @entity168 has always been governed by alliances between its various parties , with power traditionally alternating between a center - right - led @entity175 government in coalition with several right - wing and religious parties and periods of rule by the center - left labor in coalition with several left - wing parties .			0

fears in @entity8 that a hung parliament will leave the country with a weak government
@entity30 and @entity190 have been *negotiating* with @entity11 to form coalition
economic stability key to any agreement , according to senior @entity10 *lawmaker*
@entity51 has a history of *successful* and stable coalition governments
