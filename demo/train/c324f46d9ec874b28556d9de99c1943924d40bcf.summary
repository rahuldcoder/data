@entity0 -- all @entity2 had to do was hand a @entity5 birth certificate to immigration officials and he was on his way to becoming a @entity9 citizen			1
" i started to receive my work permission , i went to the @entity11 , got my driver 's license , i get my @entity14 and that was it , " he said			1
those are the privileges afforded to @entity16 who flee the @entity18 regime and make it to the @entity9 to seek asylum			1
but @entity2 , who asked @entity1 not to use his real name , was not entitled to the privileges			0
he 's @entity23 , not @entity5			1
the forged birth certificate he said he bought for $ 10,000 was enough to pass initial scrutiny and he was able to live free and clear in the @entity9 for years			1
pretending to be @entity5 has become a trend in visa fraud , according to @entity28 , special agent in charge of the @entity32 's @entity31 office in @entity0			1
anatomy of a fraud the scam starts with the purchase of a @entity5 birth certificate for between $ 10,000 and $ 20,000 , she said			1
birth certificates are not yet computerized in @entity16 -- they 're torn from a book and the information is filled out by hand before being logged into a register			1
" the documents that they are presenting in some cases are actual @entity5 birth certificates which are smuggled into the country blank , and then filled in with fictitious information here , " @entity44 said			1
and while the documents are easily falsified , the benefits they can bring are real			0
" there 's little doubt that @entity16 are treated better than any other group , " said @entity55 , executive director of @entity56			1
" and that 's been the case for decades			0
" since the 1966 @entity62 , @entity16 automatically gain refugee status upon arriving in the country and are put on a fast track to naturalization			1
the minute @entity16 set foot on @entity9 soil they do n't need to worry about being deported , unlike migrants or even asylum - seekers from other countries			1
they receive a green card after being in the @entity9 for a year and a day -- a much shorter time than faced by other legal immigrants			1
paying for a forged birth certificate often also brings coaching on how to answer questions so immigration officials believe the holder is @entity5			1
@entity28 recalls one case in which the document - seller told the buyer , " ok , we 're going to need you to get really sunburned and we 're going to drop you off in the water and you 're going to have someone that is going to rescue you and you 're going to say that you were on a raft or a boat and it sunk			0
" arriving in the @entity9 on a raft is the same advice that @entity92 gave one of his buyers , who turned out to be an undercover officer taping the conversation			2
on camera @entity97 can be heard telling the agent , if asked " why do you have a @entity101 accent , " to say , " uh , because i work with a lot of @entity101 , i caught it			0
he declined @entity1 's request for an interview			0
court documents show special assistant u.s. attorney @entity108 accused @entity97 of being the leader of a ring that sold fraudulent documents to at least 50 illegal aliens , with proceeds exceeding $ 500,000			0
last year , @entity97 pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit immigration fraud and he is currently serving a 33 - month sentence in a federal prison			0
officials say in recent cases they have found more documents that can be traced to @entity97 's ring			0
' a rising trend ' it was an increase in @entity5 asylum claims that prompted @entity125 , the lead agency for the @entity127 and @entity128 , to take a closer look at the application process			2
when they found fraud , a task force initiative , " @entity134 , " was created			1
@entity28 says the initiative was specifically set up to " combat a rising trend of immigration fraud based on false claims to @entity5 birth and citizenship			1
" the operation was launched in august 2012 and includes representatives from @entity143 , @entity144 and the @entity9 @entity145			2
there have been 40 arrests since it was started			0
investigators are going back as far as five years , the statute of limitation on these cases , in search of asylum claims made with fraudulent @entity5 documents			2
" in the past things were probably processed through more along the lines of a rubber - stamp type process , " @entity28 explained			0
" now they are all scrutinized			0
" that scrutiny may have led to the letter @entity2 received from immigration authorities asking for more documentation to support his @entity5 birth certificate			1
it came four years after @entity2 presented himself to immigration officials as a @entity5			2
in that time he had built a business , gotten married and started his @entity9 life			2
left with few options , @entity2 decided to " self - deport " instead of being charged with a crime			0
he went back to @entity23			0
immigration attorney @entity171 , who 's representing people involved in the fraudulent scheme , said : " really what this is , is a desperation act by people who do n't realize that it is never a good thing to present fraudulent papers			0
" @entity2 has now abandoned his forged @entity5 papers , but he said resuming life as a @entity23 at home did not work			1
he said he was attacked and did not feel safe in his home country			0
that fear and a longing for his old @entity9 life led him to sneak back into the @entity9 over land just last month			2
he is now living as an undocumented immigrant , under the threat of deportation if caught			0
that 's something @entity97 will never understand			0
when he finishes his prison sentence he will be released back onto the streets of @entity9			2
unlike his buyers , @entity97 wo n't be deported			0
he really is @entity5 .			2

a task force finds that some immigrants are claiming to be @entity5
forged birth certificates are used to gain privileges offered to @entity16 in the @entity9
one *man* got a driver 's license and @entity14 number within days
