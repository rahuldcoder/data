-- world leaders are meeting in @entity2 this week to discuss how to deal with the threat of nuclear terrorism			1
the effort to prevent the misuse of nuclear materials and the spread of nuclear weapons has long - placed most emphasis on defensive measures			2
these are essentially on the " supply side " -- aiming to choke off the flow of nuclear weapon components and radiological materials to terrorists			0
while there is a place for such steps , there is another , and perhaps more successful way , to accomplish the goal			0
one of the gravest threats to nuclear proliferation arises from the nations that use proxy groups -- seemingly independent organizations that are paid to further the interests of governments			1
ending or reducing the use of such proxy groups has real potential to reduce the availability of such materials to terrorists			1
perhaps the single , most dominant security threat stems from the nuclear - tipped country of @entity41 , with its accepted use of proxy groups to promote the perceived national interest			1
third - party transfer , where a country receiving weapons sells or gives them to another party , is always a danger , and with it looms the possible catastrophe of nuclear weapons in the wrong hands			0
it is clear that the @entity57 government is working hard with @entity41 officials to ensure that security at nuclear facilities and radioactive material storehouses is more robust			1
this has been taking place for years			0
for example , @entity64 and @entity67 's @entity66 article in 2007 ( @entity57 @entity68 in @entity69 ) describes initiatives undertaken from the time of the @entity74 and @entity75 administrations and the complexities associated with efforts to work with an ally that remains fundamentally " suspicious " of our intentions			0
but the broader question remains : why does @entity41 leadership continue its half - hearted support for counterterror practices aimed at those in a position to acquire such materials ? for one thing , @entity41 has a legacy of using proxy groups to promote its national security interests that goes back at least to the 1950s			1
at the time , prime minister @entity94 of @entity95 worked to stoke nationalist demands and aspirations from the @entity99 population in geographical locales near the " @entity101 , " the disputed border between @entity41 and @entity95			0
in turn , @entity41 leaders used @entity105 as a framework and its own proxies as counterweights , to promote an alternate vision of a unified region unfettered by political instability and social unrest			2
@entity113 ( " @entity113 " ) is perhaps the most prominent @entity41 proxy in the contemporary world because it is generally recognized as having carried out the @entity117 terrorist assaults in 2008			1
this terrorist group is long known for its fierce struggle in @entity120 against @entity122 - supported political leaders and @entity122 security forces			2
to be sure , @entity41 is not the only country in @entity125 that practices international politics in this way ; @entity122 has also used its own set of proxies to promote national interest in effective and sustained ways in places such as @entity95 and @entity133			0
but while the use of proxies in the region is not especially new , the risks nowadays are compounded by the presence of nuclear weapons and radiological materials			0
it is vital that @entity41 comes to grips with its use of proxy groups and explores alternatives			1
the use of proxies in pursuit of national policy also has implications with respect to @entity152 , with its track record of trying to enhance its power in @entity155 by supporting insurgents and providing know - how for the building of improvised explosive devices			0
in @entity95 , where the weak @entity162 government remains unable or unwilling to meet its security obligations outside of @entity164 , @entity152 proxies wield their influence			0
it is likely that @entity152 leaders support the @entity169 organizations in @entity170 - dominated @entity41 as well as @entity169 militant group @entity171 with the broader aim of destabilizing @entity41 , in no small part to undermine @entity57 efforts in the region			1
what does that portend for possible short - run relationships between @entity179 and @entity41 if @entity152 is deemed a common threat ? in turn , what does that portend for the @entity57 from its own geostrategic position ? we should take a page out of the conflict resolution literature playbook and use bargaining techniques that seek to isolate and identify motivations behind @entity41 's position on the use of proxy groups			1
for example , the fears and anxieties political leaders experience often drive " hard - line " bargaining positions on issues , and knowing what those fears are in the case of @entity41 , @entity57 leadership can work to relieve those fears by providing alternatives			1
another technique is to break down large seemingly unsolvable problems into smaller , more manageable ones			0
for instance , the broader policy of drone use by the @entity57 can be broken down into smaller policies where agreement is possible			0
one possibility is putting in place tighter restrictions to satisfy @entity41 's leaders on when drones should be used , in what specific cases or as backups to other forms of interdiction			2
in turn , compromises like those can and should be linked to issues of importance to the @entity57 such as stronger @entity41 support for @entity57 talks with the @entity230 and greater transparency by the @entity41 about security policies			2
such talks might start a process that could lead to new agreements that come closer to confronting @entity41 proxy use			2
all of this requires unequivocal @entity57 commitment to @entity41 for the long haul , to allay fears of abandonment			0
against that backdrop , such problem - solving efforts would generate alternatives that might lead to innovative thinking about new security arrangements in @entity41 and other countries such as @entity122 and @entity95			1
it is possible to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons and radiological material dissemination by reducing reliance on proxy groups , and that could be our most effective tool in this ongoing battle			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity260 .			0

world leaders meeting in @entity2 to discuss security measures against nuclear terrorism
@entity260 : one major *source* of risk is the use of proxy groups by nations
he says nuclear - armed @entity41 is one of the countries where proxy groups have been used
@entity277 : in a nuclear age , *empowering* proxy groups could lead to disaster
