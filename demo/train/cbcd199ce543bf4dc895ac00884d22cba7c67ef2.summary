-- two @entity4 students are on probation for the rest of their time at the @entity9 state school for using a gun to scare a man they say was trying to barge into their apartment , their lawyer said tuesday			1
having such a firearm on university - owned property violates @entity4 policy , a fact that led to the possibility that students @entity21 and @entity23 would be suspended or expelled			1
the two were instead placed on probation , according to their lawyer @entity27			1
harsher penalties may follow if either is found to have violated university policies in the future			0
@entity21 and @entity23 think being on probation goes too far because the penalty goes on their permanent record and means they are n't " in good standing " at private , four - year @entity38 university in @entity39 , @entity9			2
they are appealing the school 's decision , said @entity27			2
the lawyer also said he 's found that @entity4 does not own the apartment complex where the incident took place ; rather , the university has a 99 - year lease from the complex 's owners and is subleasing units to students			1
the penalties stem from an incident the night of october 24 , when the two students got a knock on their apartment door			1
@entity21 told @entity0 affiliate @entity58 in @entity39 that he opened the door , and a stranger , who said he 'd just gotten out of jail , asked for $ 15			0
@entity21 told @entity58 he offered the man a blanket and a can of food but " did n't feel comfortable " giving the man money because he was a stranger			2
" my gut instinct was telling me i was n't going to be able to get that door closed before he came through , " @entity21 said			0
as the man started coming through the door , @entity21 said , he yelled for @entity23 , his roommate			2
@entity23 said he came to the door with his pistol drawn , and the students said the man turned and ran away			1
both police and campus security responded when @entity21 and @entity23 then called 911			0
according to the @entity4 's executive vice president @entity75 , all university housing is patrolled at regular intervals by campus security			1
but this particular apartment complex is n't gated , and secured key cards or codes are n't required for entrance			0
shortly after the incident , police captured the man , whom they identified as a six - time convicted felon			1
at about 2 a.m. the next day , campus security officers returned to @entity21 and @entity23 's apartment and confiscated a pistol and a shotgun from the apartment			1
the gun is owned by @entity21 , who uses it to hunt periodically , and @entity23 has a state - issued permit to carry a concealed handgun , @entity27 said			0
in @entity9 , gun owners are not required to register their weapons			0
in a disciplinary board hearing on friday , the board , made up of three faculty members and two students , found @entity21 and @entity23 guilty of two infractions -- possessing weapons on school grounds and putting others in danger by the use of weapons , according to @entity27			2
the next day , university president @entity108 said he believes this incident offers " an opportunity to do some important work , as a community , to objectively re-examine our firearms policy and openly debate perspectives and contextual issues			0
" until a change is made , though , the current rules remain in effect			0
