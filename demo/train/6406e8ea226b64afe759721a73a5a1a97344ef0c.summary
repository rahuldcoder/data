a rich kid gets pulled over driving a yellow @entity1 in @entity2 by police and arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence while allegedly street racing			2
it happens , but when it happens to @entity7 , it 's beyond a big deal			1
the teen idol is just the latest young star to run afoul of both the police and public relations folks			1
but is it to be expected when a teen has both fame and access to so much wealth ? tons of young stars with more money than years behind them have run into such troubles before			1
for many , standing on the precipice of adulthood or just over that line , has appeared to trigger a spate of issues in recent years , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 have dominated headlines with legal issues and rehab stints			1
" these kids do n't have their identities set and no one says ' no , ' " said @entity35 , a psychologist and author of the book , " loving yourself : the mastery of being your own person			2
" " these kids get all this money and they stop feeling themselves so they act out and they act out until they get in trouble , almost in that they have to lose everything in order to experience what they have , " she said			2
according to @entity50 , as of june 2013 the 19 - year - old had earnings of $ 58 million			0
since being discovered on @entity53 in 2008 , the singer had enjoyed an almost squeaky clean image until last year			0
then the dogs from bad publicity hell were unleashed			0
from being accused of public urination to rumors of a visit to a @entity62 brothel and the run - ins with police ( authorities recently swarmed his mansion is @entity67 , @entity68 , as part of a vandalism investigation ) , @entity7 spent most of 2013 in the news for alleged bad behavior			1
his musical mentor @entity73 , a former teen star himself , told @entity74 in december 2013 that his young protege was experiencing the pains of growing up in the spotlight			1
" with success comes great responsibility			0
and being able to grow up in it and unfortunately be analyzed in front of the world for just growing up , i think they will be able to see the truth , " @entity73 said			0
" and they can make an assessment based off of what his reality looks like			0
" lately , @entity7 's reality is not looking so great			1
meet @entity7 's inner circle former child star @entity92 said on his @entity94 radio show on @entity95 thursday that @entity7 's recent arrest could be just what the embattled teen star needs right now			1
" this is the best thing that could have happened to him , " said @entity92 , who in the past has struggled with addiction and legal troubles			1
" speaking from personal experience , this could save his life			0
" some of his fellow celebrities have condemned his behavior while others have offered support			0
psychologist @entity35 pointed out that " fame is its own addiction " and said celebs are often under the pressure of the public 's expectations			0
" i think sometimes these stars think they have to live up to their own image to the point that they almost becomes fans of their own image , " she said			2
@entity7 arrest : celebs offer sympathy , but jokes , too for some young celebs , that type of skid is almost a rite of passage at this point			1
@entity132 went from pop princess to investigated mother when in 2006 she was videotaped driving with her then - infant son @entity135 in her lap. a deputy was sent to @entity132 ' home to investigate , though no charges resulted from the incident			0
what followed was a year of outrageous behavior including the infamous hair shaving incident , and @entity132 ' father being awarded conservatorship over her fortune			2
since then , @entity132 has managed to turn her life around , bagged a gig as a judge on " @entity150 " for a season , as well as a new boyfriend , album and @entity155 residency			0
other celebs have not bounced back as well as @entity132			0
see @entity132 through the years @entity26 recently announced she will be starring in and producing a new film , and there 's a six - episode documentary series on the way			1
but her last film bombed and her career is nowhere near what it once was			0
likewise , @entity27 's reputation has never fully recovered from his 2009 arrest following the attack on then - girlfriend @entity167 just before the @entity168			1
in october 2013 , @entity27 was arrested in @entity169 on suspicion of punching a man , and then he was kicked out of a rehab facility for " acting violently			1
" now @entity7 finds himself a member of the club of @entity175 's young , rich and infamous whose mugshots join their paparazzi shots			1
his being accused of drag racing in a sports car comes just months after an outpouring of sorrow for " @entity183 " star @entity182 , who died in a crash where speed was a factor			2
it remains to be seen what the singer 's response will be to his latest troubles			0
in the past , he has been less than repentant , telling the @entity194 in november about those who criticize his behavior , " i do n't give a f * * *			0
" " not ' i do n't give a f * * * ' to just be reckless and do whatever , but ' i do n't give a f * * * what they say , " @entity7 reportedly said .			2

@entity7 is one of several rich , young and famous in trouble
