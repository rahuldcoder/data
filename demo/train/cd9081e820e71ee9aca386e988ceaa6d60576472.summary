-- @entity1 took to the streets for the second day of a nationwide strike tuesday , showing their anger over a government decision that has more than doubled fuel prices in the largely impoverished country			1
some protests over the end of fuel subsidies were marred by clashes that left 16 people dead and 205 injured , according to a tally collected by the @entity1 @entity14 tuesday			1
the strike , continued religious violence in the north and a long - simmering separatist movement are all issues that have created growing problems for @entity20 , the country 's president , and fueled tensions on the street			1
the southern state of @entity25 was a focus for much of the violence , according to the @entity14 figures , with five people killed and 83 injured			1
the situation is tense amid rumors that people from the north will be attacked , and some 4,000 people have fled their homes and sought refuge in camps , the @entity14 report says			1
@entity39 , joint secretary of the @entity25 state branch of the @entity14 , told @entity0 three people had died monday and two tuesday , as different communities clashed in the state capital , @entity44			1
one mosque building was burned and another vandalized , with cars and buses also set alight , before the police and military restored calm , he said			0
he told @entity0 he did not know if there was a religious motivation for the clashes			0
meanwhile , the situation in the northern @entity1 state of @entity55 was " generally chaotic " tuesday , the @entity14 reported , with three people killed and 55 injured , some with gunshot wounds			1
police in the neighboring state of @entity60 , where one person was killed and three injured , used tear gas to try to disperse protesters gathered in front of the government house , the @entity14 said			1
in the southwest , violence flared at some rallies in @entity69 , the country 's commercial capital , as protesters clashed with police , resulting in seven injuries and three deaths , the @entity14 said			1
three deaths were also reported in @entity74 , and one in @entity76 , according to the @entity14 figures			2
other states reported protests that were largely peaceful , despite outbreaks of vandalism and protesters burning tires or blocking roads			0
@entity84 , a @entity1 freelance journalist , attended a protest concert in @entity69 tuesday staged by musician @entity87 , son of the legendary @entity88 , and said he was proud to be there			2
" @entity1 loves peace and this is why we are peacefully protesting , even though the @entity1 police and army have inflicted injuries and in some cases , killed innocent people , " @entity90 said			2
" revolution has come to @entity1 and the youth will spearhead it			1
until our demands are met , we are ready to protest every day and make sacrifices			0
" @entity20 tried to explain the need for the end of subsidies in a recent address , telling @entity1 that the government would invest the money in the country 's crumbling infrastructure			1
" my fellow @entity1 , the truth is that we 're faced with two basic choices with regards to the management of the petroleum sector , " @entity20 said			2
" survive economically or continue with a subsidy regime that will continue to undermine our economy			0
" but assurances from the president did not allay fears from many @entity1 who do not trust the government to use the money to improve the country 's infrastructure			1
another @entity84 , 38 - year - old filmmaker and web designer @entity127 , who filmed protests in @entity69 monday , said @entity1 have lost faith in @entity20 's government			1
" @entity1 are united in this cause to see corruption dealt with , and eventually removed , " he said			2
there have also been complaints from demonstrators that the police have responded too aggressively			0
in @entity55 , a physician who was among the protesters monday said police there fired on the crowd , injuring at least 13 people			2
demonstrators were gathered listening to speeches when police " suddenly came and some were shooting and some were throwing tear gas , " said @entity148 , vice chairman of the @entity149			0
@entity148 said one protester , a 12 - year - old boy , was shot in the neck			0
another protester was shot in the groin , he said			0
but @entity55 police commissioner @entity154 denied that officers fired on protesters			0
he said that officers were forced to use tear gas on " miscreants and drug addicts " who had tried to storm the governor 's residence			0
elsewhere , there have been more conflicting reports about the violence			0
@entity167 , a union official , said three union members had been killed by police gunfire during a peaceful protest in @entity69 monday			0
but sunday @entity171 , a trade union president , said he had no reports of union members dying			0
some analysts say the changes could help @entity1 in the future			0
" if they 're prepared to try this petroleum subsidy removal then perhaps they can push through electricity reform too			0
if they do that , @entity1 's growth can be instead of 7 % -8 % a year , 10 % or 11 % , " said @entity179 , a chief economist at the global investment firm @entity180			2
but many @entity1 view the subsidy as the only benefit of living in an oil - producing country that has little infrastructure , poor roads , high unemployment and intermittent electric power			1
" though we know that in the long run , removal of ( the ) subsidy will help the economy , for now it is a high - profile lifestyle that is unbearable for most @entity1 , and soon the poorer ones will die out , " said protester @entity192			1
@entity0 's @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity201 , and journalist @entity202 contributed to this report .			2
