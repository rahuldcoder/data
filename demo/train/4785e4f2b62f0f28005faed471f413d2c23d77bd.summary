-- it 's almost impossible for a photographer to find fresh visual perspectives these days			1
@entity5 - based @entity4 had to travel to a different continent and strap into an ultra-light aircraft to find one			1
his @entity11 series presents the country from between 50 and 500 feet , providing a unique and captivating view of the savannah			1
" within the first few minutes of being up there , i was just completely blown away , " he says			2
" being in that airspace , you 're really seeing the world from a perspective that only birds see			1
obviously no human on the ground can see that , and the big jumbo jets up above do n't fly that low			2
so it 's kind of this hidden airspace to the human eye , and it just immediately struck me as a really powerful visual			2

most of it is covered by the @entity44 , a vast stretch of forbidding sandy savannah			1
it 's also the site of the @entity48 , one of the world 's largest salt flats and a surreal landscape coated in turquoise algae			2
the pans and its surrounding marshes and wetlands ( known for their baobab trees ) , as well as the @entity59 , became @entity4 's visual sandbox as he soared between photo opportunities			1
the project started in 2009 when @entity4 visited @entity11 for another assignment and had some downtime			2
he asked his client to suggest activities to fill his final free days			0
@entity4 was soon introduced to a pilot , who took him on his first ultra-light flight over the salt flats			1
" it 's just me and the pilot sitting right next to each other , knees practically touching , " he says			0
" there are no real doors , no windows — there 's only a windshield , propeller , and wings			0
" @entity4 was hooked , and returned to do three more shoots from an ultra-light and a small @entity83			1
the animals in this series — impressive when seen up close — become tiny figures that add a sense of scale and isolation			1
@entity4 took thousands of photographs of the landscape itself , but found that even with strong compositions , the pure landscapes could become harder to make sense of			0
" they look like they could be a painting ; they look like they could be shot from the moon ; they look like they could be microscopic bacteria			0
it 's hard to know what it is , " he says			0

part of what makes the photos in @entity11 work is that they straddle a line somewhere in between			1
the landscapes are comprised of familiar features , but they lose a degree of definition due to their distance from the lens			0
" you can make out trees , you can make out animals , you can see things that are recognizable to an extent , " @entity4 says , " but at the same time because of the bird 's - eye view , so to speak , things are slightly abstracted as well			1
" after graduating from college in 2003 , @entity4 started working as a photojournalist			0
by 2008 , he had acquired a taste for the more conceptual , hands - on approach of art and commercial photography			1
his personal projects tend to be thoroughly designed , humorous and forethought visions that require careful planning			0
the shots in this series , by contrast , were obtained in the midst of a heady , visceral experience , representing yet another departure from form for him			0

" for me it was capturing a really unique vision of our world , a beautiful landscape from a unique perspective , and framing moments that create interesting contrast between living things , whether they be animals or flora , and the earth itself			1
" @entity4 says he 's been flattered by the response to the series , and credits its positive reception in part to a dearth of public exposure to aerial photography as art. each photo is carefully composed and subtly balanced against the others in the series , something that would be difficult to achieve with a uav or octocopter			0
an overarching palette also unifies the work — a slightly subdued , pastoral tone achieved with slight color correction to certain frames			0
it 's an artistic sensibility that differentiates this work from straight aerial documentary photography			0
" there 's not a lot of manipulation ; it 's as you would 've seen them if you were in the seat next to me , " he says			0
" they 're documentary , but i do n't think that precludes them from being art , either			0
" photos from @entity11 are on display through march 9 at the @entity211 in @entity212			2
