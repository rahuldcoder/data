@entity0 -- twice - convicted killer @entity4 was granted final - hour stays of execution on tuesday , his attorney said			1
the stays came from the 11th @entity8 @entity7 and the @entity9			1
" i think we were within about a half hour of the execution , " said @entity10 , an attorney for @entity4 , whose supporters say is mentally disabled			1
the @entity9 acted on a appeal of a challenge to the way the prison handles the lethal injection drugs used in executions , while the federal appeals court issued a stay " ordering a further briefing on the issue of mental retardation , " @entity10 said			2
earlier tuesday , the @entity8 @entity25 denied a stay of execution , as did the state @entity25 , while the @entity29 similarly denied a request for clemency			2
listen : asking for mercy in the end the execution had been scheduled for 7 p.m. et at a state prison in @entity36 , about 45 miles south of @entity0			0
@entity4 was sentenced to death for the 1990 killing of @entity39 , another inmate in a @entity41 state prison			1
he was convicted of beating @entity39 to death with a nail - studded board while serving a life sentence in the 1985 killing of his girlfriend , @entity48			2
his lawyers have argued that @entity4 's iq of 70 means he should be spared under a 2002 decision that barred the execution of the mentally disabled			1
but a string of state courts has said @entity4 does n't qualify under @entity41 law , which requires inmates to prove mental impairment " beyond a reasonable doubt			1
" " this is the strictest standard in any jurisdiction in the nation			0
even @entity62 , a man with an iq of 70 who is diagnosed as mentally retarded by every doctor who has examined him , found it impossible to meet this standard of proof , " @entity10 said			0
@entity39 's family has called for the execution to be called off			0
the @entity70 on @entity71 also weighed in against the execution , stating , " no other state risks the lives of those with developmental disabilities to this extreme			0
" three doctors who examined @entity4 for the state " have now revised their opinions and find that mr. @entity4 does meet the criteria for mental retardation , " his lawyers argued in court papers			0
but lawyers for the state have said that @entity4 served in the @entity88 , held a job and managed his money before @entity92 's killing -- signs that he did n't necessarily meet the legal standard for retardation , even though he has a low iq			2
@entity4 had previously been scheduled for execution in july , but the state @entity25 halted the execution on procedural grounds			1
@entity41 has executed 52 men since the @entity8 @entity25 reinstated the death penalty in 1973 , according to the @entity41 @entity102			1
there are currently 94 men and one woman under death sentence in the state			0
@entity1 's @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 contributed to this report .			0
