-- teachers -- like me -- love " teachable moments , " so here 's a big one from monday 's sweeping @entity6 decision on gun rights and the states , @entity9			1
in it , the court not only validated individual gun rights , but applied them to every state and locality in the country			1
@entity17 know they have rights			1
even some of my students who confess to near - total ignorance of @entity17 politics know they have free speech , the right to peaceably assemble , and the right to have a lawyer , should they run afoul of the law			1
but what none of my students know -- and what most @entity17 also do n't know -- is that we can lay claim to these and other sacred @entity32 freedoms because of a different constitutional amendment , a cluster of 20th - century court cases , and something called " incorporation			1
" early in @entity17 's history , court rulings established that the @entity40 's @entity32 applied only to actions by the federal government , not the states			1
so , for example , if local police tried to shutter a newspaper for publishing legitimate , if unpopular , news , the newspaper would have to turn to that state 's constitution for protection or help , and not to the @entity53 's protection of a free press			2
and since every state constitution is different , the actual rights of citizens varied widely from state to state			2
moreover , in the nation 's first century , citizens rarely had direct dealings with a national government of limited size and reach			0
all this changed when the @entity65 was added to the @entity40 after the @entity66			2
several decades later , the court concluded that the @entity65 's provision saying that states may not deprive persons of " life , liberty , or property , without due process of law " could now be used to apply or " incorporate " key provisions of the @entity32 to the states			1
note , however , that this process occurred selectively , provision by provision , and over seven decades			0
the first @entity32 protection to be applied to the states was in 1897 , when the @entity84 's guarantee that private property was not to be taken for public use " without just compensation " was incorporated			2
following that , the court incorporated free speech in 1925 , press freedom in 1931 , free exercise of religion in 1934 , and so on until 1969 , when it applied the protection against double jeopardy ( being tried for the same crime twice ) to the states			0
by design , this piecemeal process did n't include everything			0
( no one would argue that the @entity103 's unincorporated right to common law suits " where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars " was the equivalent of free speech			0
) but most felt that incorporation was at an end , until two years ago			0
in its landmark 2008 decision , @entity111 , the @entity6 struck down the @entity113 's decades - old handgun ban as in violation of the @entity116 's right to bear arms			1
this decision was momentous for two reasons			2
first , it was the first time in history that a gun law was struck down as a violation of the amendment			0
second , the court contradicted past rulings that interpreted the amendment as pertaining only to citizen gun possession in connection with the " well regulated militia " mentioned in the first half of the amendment , and instead concluded that it protected an individual or personal right to own a handgun for protection in the home			2
because @entity113 is a federal enclave , the @entity116 could be brought to bear without addressing the fact that it had never been applied to the states ( the high court has repeatedly refused to hear @entity116 - based challenges in the past )			0
this brings us to @entity145 , in which gun rights advocates challenged @entity149 's local handgun ban as in violation of @entity111 -- but they also asked the court to now incorporate the @entity116			1
a five - member majority obliged			0
in his majority opinion , justice @entity153 concluded that the individual right to bear arms , while subject to the limits outlined in @entity111 two years earlier that recognized most existing gun laws , was " fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty " -- the litmus test for judging whether a right was important enough to be applied to the 50 states			1
readers eager to learn more about competing theories of incorporation are invited to plow through the five separate opinions that compose the case 's @entity170 decision			0
but whether one agrees with @entity153 that the right to own handguns promotes ordered liberty because they are " the most preferred firearm			0
for protection of one 's home and family , " or with justice @entity179 , who wrote in his dissent that guns in society " destabilize ordered liberty " by taking the lives of 30,000 @entity17 annually , @entity17 should at least know better today that the path to @entity17 rights runs through the @entity65			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189			0

@entity189 : @entity6 validated individual gun rights and applied them to every state , locality
@entity6 's 2008 decision in @entity111 was momentous , @entity189 says
the path to @entity17 rights runs through the @entity65 , @entity189 says
