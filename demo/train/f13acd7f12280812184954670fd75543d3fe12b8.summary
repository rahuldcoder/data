@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 stares at the mass grave where his youngest son is buried			1
he struggles to comprehend the split second that changed his life forever			0
he relives the moment he started to run inland with his family after feeling monday 's earthquake and hearing the distant roar of the tsunami			0
" my youngest son 's hand slipped out of my wife 's hand when the tsunami hit us			0
it just slipped , " @entity3 says			0
" we did n't know where he was			1
we could n't see a thing -- it was pitch black			1
" nine - year - old @entity24 is one of 30 victims in the village of @entity0 on the @entity1 island of @entity28 , one of the areas worst hit by the tsunami			1
most of those who died had run into the village church , around 350 meters inland , thinking it was far enough			1
all that remains of the church are the foundations and small pieces of concrete and steel , ripped apart as if it were paper			2
the villagers tell us the tsunami hit approximately six minutes after they first felt the earthquake			2
for some it simply was n't enough time to flee to higher ground			2
it 's hard to overstate how remote these @entity1 islands are			2
aid agencies are struggling to reach them , and harsh weather and torrential rain kept one aid ship out at sea for 16 hours before it was safe to dock near the devastated area			0
the @entity61 villagers say an aid helicopter dropped rice and water to them thursday , but a @entity2 crew was the first to actually land there			0
their food is almost completely gone			0
there is no shelter from the harsh storms , and the majority of the survivors are still hiding in the hills -- too scared to return to their destroyed village at sea level .			1

villagers fled to village church , but it was n't far enough
30 die in the remote village of @entity0
most survivors are still hiding in the hills
