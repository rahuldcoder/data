along the @entity0 -- a green flag fluttering in the wind designated @entity5 territory			1

@entity29 reigned along @entity0 's western border tuesday as @entity8 police attempted to hold back a tide of people , mostly foreign workers caught in the storm of change blowing through the region			1
there were simply too many people crossing too fast , overwhelming @entity8 authorities , aid agencies and volunteers trying to get a handle on what the @entity44 called a humanitarian catastrophe in the making			1

i do n't know , " he said			0
some of those fleeing @entity0 do not possess passports and other travel documents , which are often confiscated by the companies that employ them until their contracts are fulfilled , said @entity102 of the @entity103			1

one of them is @entity118			0
@entity118 , who had been working for a @entity120 construction company in the eastern @entity5 city of @entity122 for three years , was anxious to board a plane back home to @entity55			2

" as we know , @entity50 is also under a lot of stress now politically , " said @entity151 , a field officer with the @entity44 refugee agency			1

and the outgoing is 3 to 4,000			0
so we need to have a bigger capacity of people leaving the country			0
