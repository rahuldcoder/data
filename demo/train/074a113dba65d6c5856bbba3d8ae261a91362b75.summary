-- the current round of fighting between @entity3 and @entity4 will eventually stop			1
when it does , grieving and exhausted @entity4 and @entity6 will still be neighbors			2
the aftershocks of this war will reverberate not just in @entity11 , the @entity12 and @entity4 , but also in the streets of @entity14 and @entity15 , in the cafes and living rooms of @entity18 , in the foreign ministries of @entity21 countries and in the meetings rooms of the @entity23			1
this war has exposed damaged nerves , deep prejudices and flawed policies			0
here are five places where we will see the impact after the fighting stops			0
@entity4 as @entity4 were taking cover from @entity3 rockets and the @entity11 - based @entity37 group announced it was also targeting planes flying in and out of @entity4 's main airport , a television anchor in @entity33 offered a most unhelpful suggestion			1
@entity42 , she said , should give nuclear weapons to @entity3 to fight @entity4			1
meanwhile , @entity42 's @entity44 reiterated his wish to see @entity4 wiped away			2
these messages remind @entity4 of the seriousness of their situation			2
@entity3 has no interest in a two - state solution			1
it is committed to obliterating @entity4			2
@entity4 do have disagreements regarding settlements and withdrawal from the @entity12			2
but when it comes to @entity3 , there is no question			2
the @entity3 charter reads : " our struggle against the @entity60 is very great and very serious			0
" as the writer @entity61 put it , leftist @entity4 now see that " the right wing 's fears are not mere paranoia , " and the right will see that there are limits to the use of force			0
this fight will erode the position of the extreme left and the extreme right in @entity4 , giving a boost to pragmatic advocates of security			1
the debate will revive calls to find other options and strengthen more moderate forces among @entity6 who have lost ground to @entity3			0
the imperative to find a new way forward with moderate @entity6 will re-emerge after frayed nerves cool			0
but an old obstacle has grown : @entity4 ' greatest fear is a @entity6 state falling to extremists , as @entity11 did to @entity3 , receiving weapons from @entity42 and others			1
there is no way @entity4 will now accept an armed @entity6 state within tunneling distance of its major cities , especially if @entity3 remains a dangerous player			1
@entity99 @entity3 ' bravado and its killing of @entity4 may give a popularity boost to the group			1
but @entity6 are pondering @entity3 's tactics			0
they will blame primarily @entity4 , no question , but they will take a look at the @entity3 strategy that resulted in so much death and destruction			1
@entity111 president @entity110 was one of the first to say it publicly			0
when @entity4 was warning @entity3 to stop the rocket fire that triggered a ground assault , @entity110 sounded exasperated			1
" what are you trying to achieve launching rockets ? " he asked @entity3 , adding , " we prefer to fight with wisdom			2
" with @entity3 fighters hidden in tunnels , drawing @entity4 fire to civilian areas , no matter how much you hate your enemy , is a tactic that warrants examination if not outright condemnation			1
in a stark shift from previous conflicts , criticism of @entity3 was widespread in @entity21 media			0
@entity133 journalists , in particular , fulminated against @entity3			0
@entity134 the suffering of the @entity6 population of @entity11 has been a heartbreaking aspect of this conflict , and it 's hardly surprising that it spurred protests , particularly in cities with large @entity143 populations			1
but what happened in a number of @entity134 cities in @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , the @entity150 and elsewhere was something that goes far beyond a show of sympathy for the victims of war or a rejection of @entity4 's tactics			1
@entity134 saw some of the ugliest eruptions of blatant anti-semitism since the 1940s			0
critics of @entity4 often claim that @entity4 unfairly hides from critics by charging anti-semitism , but cries of " death to the @entity60 , " " slit the @entity60 throats , " or " jews to the gas chambers " along with the smashing and torching of @entity60 - owned shops and attacks on synagogues , have pulled back the cover , revealing anti-jewish sentiment that still runs deep , and in most cases remains unspoken in polite circles			2
we will find out how seriously @entity134 leaders address the matter now that we have found what lay hidden behind the curtain of civil discourse			0
@entity184 the @entity4 - @entity3 war has highlighted the emerging ideological and political alliances of a new @entity184			1
@entity187 and @entity188 have emerged as the champions of @entity3			0
their support for the @entity192 during the @entity193 became increasingly bold			0
now the two countries have become the defenders of @entity37 groups across the region , drawing the ire of other @entity21 governments			0
advocating for @entity200 in @entity11 is particularly beneficial to their political objectives , because the @entity6 cause draws popular support			0
that 's why @entity133 's decision to stand back is so remarkable			0
@entity133 under its new government has taken a firm stance against @entity3 and increasingly clashes with its supporters , particularly with @entity187			0
these political alliances complicate matters for the @entity212			0
@entity213 the fighting in @entity11 , with the dramatic pictures of @entity6 civilian deaths and thousands of rockets fired by @entity3 towards @entity4 civilians , has caused a diplomatic conundrum for @entity212			1
@entity4 is @entity213 's foremost ally in the region			1
but president @entity222 and prime minister @entity223 have disagreements			0
instead of taking a firm stance on @entity4 's side , the @entity213 has engaged in diplomacy with @entity188 , which supports @entity4 's deadliest enemies , and @entity187 , whose leaders have slandered and smeared @entity4			1
details of the diplomatic process , which amazingly excluded @entity6 moderates , have caused consternation in @entity4 , fury in @entity6 circles and disdain in @entity133			2
when the cease - fire comes , the @entity213 should review how it balances allies and their antagonists in times of crisis , because even after the shooting stops , this conflict is far from over .			1

violence continues as @entity4 and @entity3 *militants* fight in @entity11
@entity248 : this war impacts not just @entity11 , but also @entity134 and @entity184
she says the @entity213 should review how it balances allies and their antagonists
@entity254 : @entity3 has no interest in two - state solution ; both sides need moderates
