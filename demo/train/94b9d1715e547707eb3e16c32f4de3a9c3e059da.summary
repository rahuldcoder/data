@entity3 driver @entity1 grew up in @entity8 , @entity9			1
he grew up in @entity8 and could n't wait to get out of town , but after living in @entity11 for three years , he was ready to come back			1

@entity1 has recovered from a frightening crash - ending to his last race in @entity23 , @entity24 , and is looking forward to racing in @entity25 , @entity26 , this week , hoping for his first trip of the season to victory lane			2
his fans are eagerly awaiting that trademark victory back flip			0
but through all of the excitement and acclaim , @entity1 remains grounded and true to his @entity9 roots			1
he took @entity0 home with him to @entity8 -- which is between @entity36 and @entity37 -- to share some of his favorite spots			1
the day started at @entity39 , 2,273 acres of natural beauty and serenity that is hard to believe is only 10 minutes from the bustling center of this college town			1
" this park is one of @entity8 's best secrets			1
it 's a beautiful place to come mountain biking , hiking			0
there 's a cave that runs under this ground that goes for over 50 miles			0
" the park boasts 15 miles of trails and endless possibilities for adventure , from hiking and biking to canoeing and even cave exploration			0
when @entity1 gets the need for speed at home , he opts for two wheels instead of four			2
he grabs his bicycle and heads to the @entity64 , just up the road from @entity66			0
" this used to be an old railroad , and now it 's a state park			0
it 's 10 feet wide , it 's over 200 miles long , and all of this is open to the public			2
" @entity1 also showed us one of his favorite trail features : a beautiful giant bur oak tree simply referred to by @entity9 natives as " the big bur oak			1
" @entity1 says it 's one of the oldest in the state and thinks that it is one of the coolest spots along the trail			1
all that exercise and fresh air can certainly rev up an appetite , and @entity1 has two favorite places to cure that			1
for what he calls the best burger in the world , he heads to @entity93 , one of his high school hangouts			1
" we used to come here in high school when we probably should have been in school			0
we 'd shoot pool , eat booch burgers and just have a good time , " he said			0
we were greeted by one of the owners , @entity101 , who poked a little fun at @entity1 ' trademark backflip celebration			2
" the only thing flipping in here is the burgers , " @entity101 said			0
@entity93 has been in operation in @entity8 since 1884			1
next up is @entity110 , which has been serving slices in @entity8 for more than 35 years			2
" they can make you anything you want			0
they 've got whole wheat crust if you 're into the health stuff like i am			0
and it 's so good , they even catered my wedding			0
" these are just some of the hidden gems of @entity1 ' @entity8 , but this town has much more to offer			1
there are museums , festivals and parades , and the @entity130 has provided a lot of athletic excitement with its football and basketball teams over the past few years			0
it 's a perfect weekend getaway from its larger surrounding cities			0
and if you live farther away than that , it 's worth the trip !			0
