-- be warned @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 -- from here on in it 's all about grand slam titles for @entity7			1
the 31 - year - old @entity7 has done it all in the world of tennis , winning more championships than any other male player in history and spending a record number of weeks at the top of the world rankings			1
but as he approaches the twilight of his glittering career , the 17 - time major winner is prioritizing adding to that record haul over returning to the no. 1 spot			1
after clinching a record - equaling seventh @entity23 singles title last year , the @entity22 maestro occupied the top berth for a 287th week , breaking the previous record held by @entity29 icon @entity27			2
while admitting reaching no. 1 for the first time in 2004 was a special achievement , when asked by @entity0 's @entity34 whether he would rather win grand titles or returning to the top , the current no. 2 replied : " at this stage in my career grand slam titles			1
" last year , to get back to world no. 1 was incredible , but i think it is really the first time you get there			1
you can not match that up with any other moment , maybe in your career , because it 's such a big thing			0
" at this point in my career its titles			0
i 've won a lot and i feel if i keep playing the way i am i can still achieve a bit more			0
so i guess its titles now			0
" records since turning professional 15 years ago , @entity7 has notched up a steady stream of records , but surpassing landmarks has never been something he has paid much attention to			1
" i never had a ' to do ' list , " continued the 31 - year - old @entity22 player			1
" it 's really the media who talk about it			0
" when i was close to the all - time grand slam record or the all - time weeks at world no. 1 , i was one week away , one slam away , of course you 're going to push to try and beat that , but i never adjusted my schedule accordingly			1
" i knew if i played well , records would fall along the way			0
" motivation despite his unparalleled success , in recent years @entity7 has seen his position as the reigning power in tennis taken by the all - conquering @entity1			1
the @entity83 has won five of his six grand slam titles in the last two years , while world no. 3 @entity3 has also risen to the top by winning his first major title as well as reaching the last three showpiece finals			1
it was @entity91 's @entity3 who eliminated @entity7 at the semifinal stage of last month 's @entity93 , an event @entity1 won			2
" i still have the hunger and the urge to achieve more , because i truly love this sport , " added @entity7			2
" that 's the easiest part for me , the motivational part			0
" i get a lot of questions asking how i do it , but for me it 's pretty simple			0
i wake up in the morning excited to be a tennis player			0
" balance despite his sporting ambition , @entity7 is very conscious of the importance of spending time with his wife and twin daughters			2
" i 'm working hard i 'm training hard , but at the same time i 'm making sure i have enough rest and family time , " said the @entity22 star			2
" at my stage of my career , i need to make sure i get the balance right			0

@entity7 would rather win more grand slams than return to no. 1 ranking
