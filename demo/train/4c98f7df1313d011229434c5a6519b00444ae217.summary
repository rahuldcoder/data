-- get a kick out of this : researchers reported wednesday finding the world 's oldest leather shoe in a cave in @entity7			1
the 5,500 - year - old one - piece shoe antedates @entity9 by a millennium and precedes every loafer , mukluk , wader , clog , bootee , stiletto , wingtip , mule , @entity18 and cross trainer anyone has ever seen , according to @entity21 , a lecturer in prehistoric archaeology at @entity23 in @entity24			1
the effort that resulted in the find dates to 2005 , when @entity21 and his team of archaeologists first entered the cave about an hour south of the capital city of @entity32 , in @entity34 province on the border with @entity36 and @entity37 , and decided it looked promising			2
two years later , @entity21 returned , dug down about half a meter and " started discovering everything , " including rare , well - preserved organic material such as textiles , ropes and wooden stakes , leading them to redouble their efforts			1
the next year , they excavated in a house that had been constructed inside the cave and found a pit covered with sheep or goat dung			1
below the dung , they found broken pottery and goat horns covering the shoe , said the authors , who published their findings in the online scientific journal @entity60			1
the right - footed , undecorated shoe -- today it would be a size 5 -- probably belonged to a woman , " but we can not be certain ; it could be a man with small feet , " @entity21 said			1
a leather thong is stitched through four sets of eyelets in the back and 15 sets in the top			2
the shoe was lightly worn			2
some of the eyelets have been recut , but the sole shows little wear			0
" we thought originally it could be a discard , but at the same time , it 's very strange , because we have only one shoe , and it 's in very good shape , " @entity21 said			2
" it looks like it was more than likely deliberately placed in this way			0
" if so , it would join a number of other items that appear to have been placed as offerings			0
at the back of the cave , the archaeologists found pots full of grain and three pots , each containing the skull of a child -- their jaws removed			1
" it 's pretty weird , " he said			0
two leather samples were taken : one was sent for carbon dating to the @entity102 at the @entity103 and the other to the @entity105 ; a piece of the straw was sent to @entity18			2
age estimates were the same for all three			0
@entity21 said he had no idea how common it would have been at that time for people to wear shoes			0
his is the second - oldest shoe find ; a pair of 7,500 - year - old sandals made of fiber was found in @entity116 , he said			1
but that does n't mean shoes were not commonly used			0
the fact that so little footwear from those days has been found could be explained by the fact that shoes do n't tend to age well			1
had it not been for the conditions inside the cave , the shoe would probably have disintegrated long ago			1
though temperatures in the region range from sweltering in the summer to icy in winter , the interior of the limestone cave remains a dry , consistent 20 degrees @entity129 ( 68 degrees f ) , key to the shoe 's survival , he said			1
" what was exciting was that it is so complete and it looks so much like a modern shoe , with the eyelets and everything			2
obviously , these people already knew how to make it			0
" and there was a level of sophistication in the product that he did not expect			0
the cow leather appeared to have been split and cured with a vegetable oil , said @entity21 , who favors size 10Â½ birkenstocks			2
" they actually look a little bit like the shoe , " he said			2
" not quite -- a bit more sophisticated			0
" the fact that the cave remained untouched for so many millennia is surprising			2
it can be seen from a heavily traveled road and is only about 300 yards from a fish restaurant , he said			0
but government authorities are now posting a guard to keep away looters			0
" it 's turning [ out ] to be sort of the most important site in @entity7 , " he said			1
though he wants to display the shoe in a museum in @entity7 , he first wants to take it to @entity174 or @entity175 for preservation			1
in the two years since the footwear was unearthed , the elements have taken a toll			1
" when it came out [ of the ground ] , the leather was absolutely soft , " the @entity181 archaeologist said			0
" now , it 's hard as a rock			0
" but legislation does not exist in @entity7 that would allow him to remove a national treasure from the country , so he is waiting			1
meanwhile , the shoe sits in the @entity191 at the @entity192 in @entity193			0
on friday , @entity21 plans to return to the region , this time to dig in a cave near the one that held the shoe			1
" we want to see if it 's unique , " he said			0
even if nearby caves turn out to hold no such treasure , the 41 - year - old researcher has plenty of work ahead of him			1
" we must have excavated about 2 percent of it , " he said			0
" it could take decades " to finish the rest .			0

5,500 - year - old leather shoe found in @entity7 cave
footwear may have been left as offering
in 2 years since shoe was found , leather has hardened
