-- @entity1 lauds itself as a company committed to operating responsibly and ethically , and many of its policies reflect a strong corporate conscience			1
but when it comes to responsible gun policy , @entity1 has lost its moral compass			1
@entity1 refuses to ban loaded guns from its coffee shops in the 43 states that allow people to openly carry loaded weapons			1
as mothers , we wonder why the company is willing to put children and families in so much danger			2
nobody needs to be armed to get a cup of coffee			0
and that 's why thousands of moms across the nation are asking @entity1 to put the safety of its customers first			1
we 've started a petition asking @entity1 to ban guns from its stores			1
in response , @entity1 has referred concerned moms to a statement on its website , a statement last updated in march 2010 , about 90,000 @entity36 gun deaths ago			1
the statement reads , " the political , policy and legal debates around these issues belong in the legislatures and courts , not in our stores			0
" @entity1 spokesman @entity44 recently told @entity45 that it is a legal strategy			2
" in communities that permit open carry , we abide by local laws			1
where these laws do n't exist , openly carrying weapons in our stores is prohibited			0
" moms do n't want a gun debate with our coffee either			0
but when children are shot in schools , in movie theaters and even at @entity58 parades , we can no longer keep the debate in the places where they " belong			0
" as the debate on guns spreads to town hall meetings nationwide in august , do we really have to have one in @entity1 too ? @entity1 ' refusal to ban guns from its stores has made it a nationwide venue for pro-gun rallies , where customers toting loaded weapons gather over coffee			1
there have even been accidental shootings : earlier this year a woman shot another customer when she dropped her purse and a loaded weapon inside discharged			0
a pro-gun site called @entity80 sells a coin that looks like the @entity1 logo , except the mermaid is wielding handguns			2
on sunday , for example , 60 pro-gun activists carried handguns , semi-automatic rifles and shotguns into a @entity1 in @entity90 , @entity91			2
@entity1 claims its open carry policy simply follows state laws and local ordinances			1
however , the company is willing to overlook those in other instances ; it recently announced a smoking ban within 25 feet of any store			1
why is @entity1 willing take a public health stand on smoking , but not gun violence , which kills more than 55 children and teens a week in @entity36 ? since when is second - hand smoke more dangerous than second - hand bullets ? @entity1 also claims that banning guns from its stores would put its employees in a " potentially unsafe position " if they had to ask a gun - wielding customer to leave			1
this alleged concern has not stopped other companies -- including @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , and even @entity1 competitor @entity118 -- from prohibiting guns in their stores in states where open carry is legal			1
in fact , these companies have banned guns in order to keep employees and customers safe			1
@entity1 bans guns from its corporate headquarters in @entity131 , where open carry is perfectly legal			1
this same protection should be afforded to the millions of unarmed customers @entity1 serves each week			1
an overwhelming majority of @entity36 want common - sense gun reforms			0
but it 's not just @entity139 and state legislatures that impact society ; business policies also affect our safety			0
shame on @entity139 for failing to act , but that 's no excuse for companies like @entity1 to fail to lead			2
we never saw ourselves becoming activists			0
but like so many mothers on december 14th , we were horrified by the @entity149 shootings			0
the realization that our country 's lax gun laws led to the massacre of 20 innocent children shook both of us to the core			0
as mothers , we can not and will not abide politics and policies that needlessly put our children and other children in danger			0
@entity163 has become a rallying point for mothers across the nation who refuse to tolerate the inaction over the epidemic of gun violence			0
we will not stop until gun reforms and responsible policies are in place at the federal level , in our states and at @entity36 businesses			2
we have the most important reason of all for never backing down -- our kids			0
risking their safety is n't worth a nonfat misto at @entity1			2
women make the vast majority of spending decisions in @entity36 ; you can be sure we 'll spend those dollars with companies that value the safety of our families			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers .			0

@entity1 refuses to ban loaded guns from its shops in 43 states that allow open carry
writers : thousands of mothers want @entity1 to ban guns ; nobody needs to be armed
