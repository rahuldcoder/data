@entity0 -- on the outskirts of @entity0 , behind a high wall is a building that used to serve as a school classroom			1
on the outside , painted on the dusty gray walls , are murals of brightly colored animals			2
inside on the worn - out carpet sits a family , huddled together			1
@entity12 smiles shyly as we enter the room			1
the 25 - year - old mother of two invites me to sit on a deep red cushion , used at night for their bedding			1
her children -- five - year - old @entity21 and eight - year - old @entity22 --- sit close to their grandmother , @entity23 , who looks much older than her 54 years			1
@entity12 's sister , 20 - year - old @entity26 , and older brother @entity24 , 27 , lean against the wall looking on as we set up for the interview			1
they may look like any normal @entity32 family , but they 're hiding a shameful secret : they 're all addicted to opium , the main ingredient of heroin			1
it is a drug so prevalent that one million @entity32 are addicted to it -- that 's 8 % of the population , according to the @entity43			1
" it 's very bad , " explains @entity12			1
" at first when i started to use the drug , it was like a medicine for pain relief after my husband died			1
but when i became completely addicted and needed it every day , i knew i had to search for a way to stop all this			1
" @entity12 's mother , sister and older brother also used the drug to dull their pain when @entity12 's younger brother died soon after her husband			1
" it made us feel calm and gave us comfort , " says @entity12			1
" when i felt bad about my husband and younger brother , using opium decreased my sorrow			1
" after inhaling the additive smoke that often swirled around the house , @entity12 's two young children soon became addicted , without her even realizing			1

" i always say to myself , why did i do this ? why did n't i think about my children , my future ? people want nothing to do with us			1
" that was until @entity84 found them			2
the local @entity32 woman set up @entity87 in the abandoned school about a year ago			2
it 's a place for drug addicts to live , escape their destructive environment and hopefully get clean			1
she and her small team of volunteers offer counseling to help the addicts become " mentally strong			2
" there is no government assistance to fund the program			2
instead the profits from a restaurant she owns keep @entity87 running			2
" i was sick of seeing all these drug addicts			1
they used to congregate under the @entity106 bridge , near @entity107 , " she recalls			0
" the people where in such bad condition -- hundreds maybe more were there every single day			0
the police moved them on so now they 're spread out all over the city			0
but nobody is there to think about their life and take care of them , so that 's when i came up with idea to start @entity87			1
" read more : @entity43 : @entity32 ' world 's biggest producer of hashish ' she admits that not everyone is cured by the time they leave the program			1
in fact many return to their former lives , but she says she has to try and help these people who 've lost all hope			0
" nobody is helping people in my country , " she says			0
" everything is so wrong here			0
the government is corrupt , which means society is also corrupt			0
" in another suburb , close to the slums of @entity0 , is a methadone clinic operated by @entity144 ( @entity144 )			1
it 's the only clinic in @entity32 that is allowed to dispense methadone --- a substitute for heroin			1
some 71 addicts registered on the program arrive each day to receive the methadone -- a liquid poured into a small paper cup and drunk once a day			0
program director @entity153 says this is the best and most effective way to get drug addicts off heroin			2
it also eliminates the use of needles and dramatically reduces the risk of @entity161 spreading			0
" what we fear is that this epidemic , we have a concentrated epidemic of @entity161 among the entire population ... if this grows , and it will grow if you do n't put any effective intervention into place , then automatically it will get out of hand and then there 's nothing you can do , " he says			2
two years ago , the @entity32 government allowed @entity144 to expand the methadone program to 200 clients			0
several months later they shut it down , @entity177 says , claiming they had n't decided if this was the best form of treatment			2
" this decision means there are only 71 clients under methadone in the whole of @entity32 , " explains @entity177			0
" the drug addiction problem in @entity32 is enormous and growing and unless they extend the program , the situation is only going to get worse			2
" watch video : drug addiction rampant on @entity0 's streets in a small room at the back of a clinic is a bed for addicts who walk in off the street			1
the program has been able to take a new patient because one of the registered addicts came off methadone			0
@entity177 introduces me to 38 - year - old @entity207 who has just arrived			0
he gets off the bed and shakes my hand -- a huge smile reveals his missing teeth			0
what teeth he does have are black and decaying			0
@entity207 decided to come to the clinic after meeting the outreach team of @entity144			0
several times a week , the health workers visit areas around @entity0 where drug addicts live and hand out clean needles , sterile swabs and offer counseling			1
" i know these people , they used to give me clean needles			0
they kept telling to come to the clinic and finally i did , " he proudly explains			0
" i feel better now , because the methadone is a replacement of the drug -- it gives us a better feeling			2
i want to use methadone until i forget about drugs completely and to find a good way to start a normal life again			0
" @entity207 has been using heroin for the past 14 years , supporting a habit of three grams a day , which costs about us $ 24			0
but the father of four says his family has had enough , and has told him he has to get off drugs or they wo n't support him any longer			2
" drugs are ruining my life			0
it 's a bad thing in our society , " he says			2
" i also have got bad effects from drugs and my family has also been affected -- that 's why i need to stop this			1
" one man who now works at the clinic knows exactly what @entity207 is going through			0
@entity255 , 48 , was one of the first patients to arrive at the clinic two and a half years ago			0
" i 'd been using drugs for 17 years			0
i started when i was in a prison in @entity259 , " he says			0
" during that time i faced a lot of problems and difficulties			0
i did n't have any information or contact with my family and that 's when i started to use heroin			1
" when i got out of prison someone told me methadone was coming to @entity32 and i wanted to get on the program			0
now i do n't even use methadone			0
" @entity255 's journey is inspiring but sadly it 's the rare exception in @entity32 , not the rule .			2
