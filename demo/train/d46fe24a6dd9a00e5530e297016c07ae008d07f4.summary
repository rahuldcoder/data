-- much was made of the death of the @entity2 last year , when the last van rolled off a @entity5 factory floor after more than 60 years of continuous production			1
but there are still places where this icon of world travel can be found , spluttering and stuttering along the dusty paths of adventure			0
a small tour company in @entity15 has discovered a few kombis rusting away , abandoned by their owners in dusty corners of the country , and is putting them to use as hardy servants of travelers seeking alternate means of travel			1
in 2009 , @entity24 and @entity25 toured @entity15 from the @entity26 on a motorcycle and saw several deserted @entity2 vans along their way			1
a year later they returned , bought and revived one of these relics , named it " @entity34 , " and founded @entity35			1
from ambulance to tour bus @entity34 , a 37 - year - old red @entity2 , was first registered as an ambulance in the northwest of @entity15			1
" she 'd been last used as a matatu ( bus / taxi ) , " says @entity40 , director of @entity35			1
" though when we found her , she was being used as a storage for car parts with the words ' please enjoy me again ' painted on the back window			0
" the company quickly found two more camper vans , namely @entity51 ( @entity52 ) -- formerly an ambulance -- and the dude , formerly a chicken hutch			1
many of the @entity57 were used as taxis and minibuses until they become difficult to maintain			0
" @entity2 are no longer common in @entity15 , " says @entity40			1
" they ceased to be used as taxis and buses in 2000			2
" they 're actually the more expensive choice because of the amount of ( maintenance ) invested in them but most clients still choose them for the novelty factor , " says @entity40			0
every recovered @entity2 is reincarnated by chief mechanic @entity71 , who refits the engine and brakes , reworks the body and takes the van on a 700 - kilometer test drive			1
" when i get back [ from the test drive ] , we have a nice @entity2 , " says @entity71			2
good , bad , ugly of a @entity2 tour not all @entity2 fans are confident the vehicle is suited to @entity82 's terrain			1
" having been to @entity82 , i believe there are more appropriate vehicles for touring this part of the world , " says @entity84 @entity83 , a @entity2 fan who toured @entity85 in a @entity2 in 1973			2
" @entity90 is / was fun and has great memories , but it 's old technology and i would n't seek out a tour that uses these for a nostalgic rationale , " he adds			0
thus , the company also owns a fleet of 4x4 @entity99 as backups			0
" [ our camper vans are ] a bunch of old ladies , and this means that they do occasionally have hiccups , usually related to poor - quality fuel confusing their guts , " says @entity40			0
but the company says no major breakdowns have occurred so far			0
" @entity35 was born out of @entity25 's and @entity24 's motorcycle tour and it remains the inspiration of the tour company , " says @entity40			1
" [ @entity2 tours ] are to replicate that trip , a true adventure , " says @entity40			2
" many of the clients that we attract are from that ' nostalgia market , ' those who traveled in a @entity2 back in the 1970s			1
" one quality that has turned @entity57 into icons of resourcefulness are the stories that get towed along in their exhaust stream			0
@entity40 describes one such episode : " in february 2014 , we were traveling between @entity130 , home of the tree - climbing lion and @entity134 , home of the mountain gorillas			0
" we left the savannah of the national park only to find the road had been resurfaced the day before and raised about 40 centimeters and we could n't get the @entity2 onto the main road			2
" luckily , @entity141 , one of the clients who had owned a @entity2 in @entity143 in the ' 70s , and her nephew , had a good sense of adventure			1
" together we dug some of the gravel and sand -- luckily not yet tarmac -- and made a clearance to drive the vehicle up -- and replaced it afterward of course			0
" ' they 'll be around another 40 years ' the @entity2 has been in production since the 1950s but @entity155 shut down its @entity5 plant , the last facility making the vans , on the last day of 2013			1
" we are , of course , all saddened that they will at some point fade away , " says @entity40			0
" but we think they 'll be around for another 40 years or so			0
from a business perspective , it makes them more special and unique			0
" on tour outside of @entity167 [ the vans ] certainly turn heads			2
children run to them in the village and sometimes just stare at them , confused , in the very remote areas			0
" old men wave and its been known for them to stop walking and take off their hats ! " have you traveled in a @entity2 ? share your experience in the comments section .			2

@entity155 ended the production of the @entity2 last year , but the vans ' resourceful spirit *thrives* in @entity15
@entity35 recovers abandoned kombis and turns them into tour buses
" many of the clients that we attract are from that ' nostalgia market , ' " says company director
