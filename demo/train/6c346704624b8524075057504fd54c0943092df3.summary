-- the world of @entity2 may seem an unlikely source of inspiration for a major carbon - cutting initiative , but technology used for coordinating pit - stops is primed to slash emissions from airports across the globe			1
according to @entity16 's @entity15 ( @entity15 ) , more than half the planes landing at @entity14 's @entity13 airport are stuck in circles overhead -- often for 20 minutes at a time -- as they wait for its congested runways to clear			1
@entity15 says the carbon cost of this pile - up in the sky is an estimated 600 tons a day			0
and this is where @entity24 , the hugely successful @entity2 team behind former world champions @entity26 and @entity27 , have come in with an unexpected solution			2
over the years the company has developed modeling software to analyze live racing data and visualize a range of potential scenarios -- allowing pit crews to make strategic decisions in the blink of an eye -- all in an effort to get their cars back out onto the racetrack milliseconds ahead of their competitors			0
it 's this ground - level tracking technology that could hold the key to unlocking congestion , reducing co2 emissions by streamlining the way aircraft make their own pit - stops once they 've landed -- dropping off passengers , refueling and departing again with @entity2 efficiency			1
this similarity between a motor race and an airport runway was first observed by @entity56 , head of aviation data solutions at @entity15 , while attending a workshop on cross-industry collaboration at @entity24 's @entity16 technology center three years ago			1
" it became clear that the pit - stop in a race track , with cars coming in , changing tyres and refueling and going out again actually is pretty similar to an aircraft arriving at the airport , parking at the gate , passengers getting off , refueling and going out , " said the air traffic veteran , who has over 30 years experience in the industry			1
the beauty of @entity24 's system is that it reduces the complexity of a racetrack into a circle " so at the point of decision , presentation of the data is very simple , which allows the engineer in a very stressful environment to make the right strategic decision and also see the data in a very clear , crisp format , " said @entity56			0
for the last three years @entity15 has been working with @entity24 's engineers to map @entity13 's taxiways and runways -- much as they do a @entity2 track			1
but now , says @entity56 , in place of a race strategist the system is operated by @entity13 's air traffic control , and instead of a circle the airport 's network of runways and taxi lanes are represented by a simple rectangle -- enabling planes to be guided around the airport with greater ease and accuracy once they 've landed			2
the collaboration has been " groundbreaking " according to @entity110 , managing director of @entity111 -- the @entity2 team 's tech division			0
" to my knowledge this is a first -- @entity15 has invested in this because there is nothing like it available , " he added			0
the system is now in its " proof of concept " stage and hopes are high that it will be used by airports around the world within a year			0
" think in terms of the environmental benefits of that , " enthused @entity56			0
" large airports with about 1300 to 1400 flights a day - if you save just one minute of taxi time per flight on average , that equates to one day 's worth of taxi time - and that 's how much we could save using @entity24 's technology			2

@entity14 's @entity13 airport hopes to cut @entity146 emissions by using motor racing technology
software developed by @entity2 's @entity24 reduces waiting time in pit - stops
@entity16 's @entity15 , software could be use to cut air congestion
