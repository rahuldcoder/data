-- last friday , i was in @entity3 's @entity2 as a member of the legal team that persuaded its judges to overturn our country 's inhumane anti-homosexuality law			1
today , i am in @entity10 for the @entity13 - @entity12 " investing in the @entity11 " with a message : invest in human rights in @entity16			1
it 's hard to believe that @entity16 leaders and some development experts still debate whether human rights is a " @entity22 concept " and whether countries can grow without human rights			1
@entity16 leaders have been too eager to advance their own economic and security agendas without consideration of the rights of their citizens			1
let 's take the record of my country , @entity3 , and its @entity32			2
this law codified rampant discrimination against lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people , who were targeted by police and arrested , detained for prolonged periods , extorted and blackmailed by those who should have been guaranteeing their rights under our constitution			2
the law stipulated punishments of up to life in prison for gay people engaging in sex and long sentences for " attempted homosexuality " or even promotion of it			1
although the @entity2 invalidated the anti-homosexuality law , it did so on a procedural point , not on the grounds of human rights			1
and a law that criminalizes sex acts " against the order of nature " dating back to colonial times is still on the books			0
we do not know if the @entity3 parliament will vote on this law again in a way that would pass scrutiny by the @entity2			2
the fight might not be over			0
but if supporters of this law reintroduce it , or if it is appealed , we will fight it every step of the way again			0
the @entity3 government 's intolerance of homosexuality created an atmosphere of fear and intimidation for nonprofit @entity3 organizations as well			2
it recently ordered the well - respected @entity84 at @entity85 to suspend its work over the ridiculous allegation that it was promoting homosexuality and lesbianism			0
even health and development projects funded by the @entity13 have not been spared			0
in april , the @entity3 police raided and closed the @entity93 in @entity94 because it works in partnership with the lgbt community to combat @entity97 and was " training youths in homosexuality			0
" sadly , human rights violations in @entity3 are not limited to the government 's prejudicial and irrational treatment of @entity104 people			1
for instance , our constitution , like the @entity107 , guarantees freedom of assemblyâ € ” but in practice , the @entity3 government restricts this right			0
in recent years , my country 's police have used violence more and more frequently against opposition protesters , going as far as breaking up public meetings and arresting and intimidating pro-democracy activists			0
this trend is only likely to increase with the enactment of the new @entity123			0
this law grants even more power to the @entity3 police to regulateâ € ” and in practice , to stifleâ € ” public assemblies and demonstrations , with no legal recourse for the protesters			2
i love my country , @entity3 , and do n't mean to focus on it unfairly			0
one need only look to recent excesses in @entity135 and @entity136 to gain a broader view			0
our leaders in @entity16 selectively demonstrate their support for human rights , often when the continent is reminded of its obligations under international and regional human rights treaties			1
this limited conception of human rights so often means that unpopular people and ideas find themselves attacked and abused			1
in @entity3 and across the continent , civil society organizations are looking to @entity16 leaders and the @entity13 to join us in making history			1
the summit 's website accurately describes @entity16 as " one of the world 's most dynamic and fastest growing regions			2
" we are all proud of that , and understand that the summit must address crucial issues of economic development			0
but to make this summit truly historic , the @entity13 and @entity16 nations must work together to promote democracies rooted in national constitutions and human rights , committed to protecting the dignity of all their citizens .			1

*president* @entity170 holds first - ever @entity13 - @entity16 summit in @entity10 this week
@entity173 : @entity16 leaders often give lip *service* to human rights , but abuse them
@entity173 : @entity3 , other countries still torment gay people , jail protesters and opponents
@entity173 : @entity13 and @entity16 leaders must work together toward human rights in @entity16
