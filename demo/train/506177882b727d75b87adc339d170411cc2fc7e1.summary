-- @entity2 are in a war that pits the politically correct against @entity5 carolers , some say			1
they say it 's a battle that plays out in the halls of @entity8 , retail stores and public schools across the country , and it 's one that 's been raging for years			2
@entity13 rep. @entity12 of @entity14 introduced a resolution this month asking that the @entity16 express support for the use of @entity5 symbols and traditions and frown on any attempt to ban references to the holiday			1
" each year , i could see a diminishing value of the spiritual part of @entity5 , " @entity12 said			2
" it would seem like another group would go from the @entity5 spirit to the holiday spirit			1
" " what i 'm afraid of -- if we do n't bring some kind of closure to this continuous change , then in 20 years it will almost be completely different from what we see today ... and so we would lose the whole emphasis of what the very early beginnings of @entity5 was all about			1
" so far , the resolution has one @entity40 and 72 republicans as co-sponsors			0
the @entity16 has n't taken it up , but the chamber adopted similar resolutions in the past			1
@entity47 , an ordained minister and executive director of @entity49 , is n't keen on the prospect of congressional action			0
" resolutions like this come up because there is this bizarre view by some members of @entity8 that there is a war on @entity5 and that they have to be the generals in some responding army , " he said			1
" my advice to the lawmakers would be promote any religion you have through your private acts , and do n't try to ' help ' the baby @entity66 by passing a resolution on his behalf			2
it is arrogant and ridiculous at the same time , " @entity47 said			0
@entity5 is in no danger of being ignored , @entity47 said , noting that signs of the holiday emerge as soon as @entity73 passes			1
" you would literally have to be living in a very deep cave not to understand that there is a religious holiday called @entity5 that is soon to come , " he said			1
in his view , some people feel a " false sense of some kind of attack on @entity5 " if a school holds a winter concert instead of a @entity5 concert , or if retailers declare " @entity84 " instead of " @entity5			0
" time.com : brief history of the war on @entity5 in @entity93 , @entity92 activist @entity91 is trying to get support for a ballot initiative that would require that public schools give their students an opportunity to hear @entity5 songs			1
( parents could opt out for their children )			0
@entity47 said the move violates the principles of church - state separation			0
" it 's not being @entity106 to recognize that most @entity5 carols are really hymns , and a hymn is a prayer set to music			2
" @entity112 , law school dean at @entity114 , a @entity115 college founded by the late rev. @entity116 , said , however , that some schools and businesses are going too far to " censor " @entity5 because they do n't know the laws			1
@entity112 founded the @entity121 , a nonprofit litigation group dedicated to advancing religious freedom and conservative values			0
the counsel provides free legal advice and defense for government entities to ensure religious viewpoints on @entity5 are not censored			0
one example @entity112 cited began in @entity130 , where an elementary school principal replaced @entity5 trees with snowmen and banned all religious symbols , saying @entity135 fell into the category			1
@entity121 sent the principal a letter telling her the law does n't require her to " secularize " the holiday			0
the counsel also pointed out that by banning religious symbols for a holiday with secular components , she risked violating the @entity145 by not being " viewpoint neutral , " @entity112 said			2
parents were upset as well			0
the principal eventually changed course and restored the tree and jolly @entity135			0
@entity151 keeps a " @entity156 " list that shows which retailers include references to @entity5 in their advertising and which do not			2
when he started the list five years ago , both sides were about even , but this year the " nice " list is longer			0
" it 's better this year than it was in 2005 , but i think it 's better this year because we and others have made a point to make sure that @entity5 is not forgotten , " he said			2
@entity167 , a senior fellow for policy studies with the @entity169 , which promotes christian values , said the " pro-christmas side " has made progress in recent years			0
in some circles , he said , " political correctness is preventing people from even sayings ' @entity5			1
' " he said it 's important to defend the right of people to celebrate the holiday and noted that december 25 is a federal holiday the government recognizes as @entity5			1
" if we want to be concerned about the fact that we are a multicultural nation , then the solution is to allow everyone the freedom to celebrate what they want rather than stifling the celebration of the majority because it might be offensive to the minority , " @entity167 said			0
in @entity197 , republicans have taken up the war on @entity5 as their own battle			2
" republicans and conservatives have definitely gained a lot of political points by pointing out some of the silliest and more extreme examples of political correctness , " said @entity200 , director of the @entity201 at the @entity202			1
but @entity13 also should worry about pushing it too far , he added , because the @entity2 people believe in " good liberal thoughts " like " diversity and different people all being treated the same			0
" it 's ok to attack political correctness , he said , but the @entity13 must be careful not to come off as " anti-minority or against diversity			1
" the attack can backfire as well if voters think their representative is more committed to protecting @entity5 than protecting jobs or economic stability , @entity200 said			0
for @entity151 , the campaign to save @entity5 continues , and it 's one he will never abandon			2
" what happens this year is not necessarily an indication of what will happen next year , so i think each @entity5 has to stand on its own and i think each one is worth fighting for , " he said			0
" i think we are winning a lot of the battles in the war on @entity5 , but i do n't think the war is done , and i do n't think it ever will be			1

there 's a resolution in the @entity16 to frown on attempts to ban references to @entity5
others say signs of the holiday are everywhere in public space ; " war " over @entity5 is not real
some go too far to " censor " @entity5 because they do n't know the laws , @entity112 says
attacking political correctness is a balancing act , survey *research* expert says
