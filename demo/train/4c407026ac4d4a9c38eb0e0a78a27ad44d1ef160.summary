-- for more than two years , details about the investigation into who killed @entity4 have been as murky as the waters where his body disappeared			1
his grieving widow told police that attackers shot him in the head on a lake that straddles the @entity16 - @entity15 border			1
she said she was forced to flee and leave his body behind			0
some blamed her for his death			0
then the severed head of the case 's lead investigator was delivered in a suitcase to a @entity15 military post			2
the trail seemed to go cold until monday , when @entity15 authorities said they had arrested a leader of the ruthless @entity29 drug cartel and linked him to the @entity31 killing			1
@entity34 @entity33 also is a suspect connected to the slaying of the @entity15 state police investigator who was heading the investigation into @entity4 's killing until he turned up dead himself nine days later , the @entity15 navy said in a written statement			1
@entity4 's widow , @entity40 , told reporters in @entity42 that the news was " a complete , out - of - the - blue shock			1
" she said she had heard no news about her husband 's killing for 10 months , and she and her family were trying to learn more " from anyone			1
" " we 've got calls out to all these different agencies , and we have n't heard back from any of them , " she said			2

they had offered a reward of more than $ 1 million for information leading to his capture			0
he was picked up in the @entity15 border city of @entity70 on saturday night and presented to the media on monday			2
but one @entity73 sheriff says the 31 - year - old alleged cartel leader was n't on a list of five suspect names in the @entity4 case that he 's handed over to the @entity78			1
" based on the information i have , he may have been the one responsible for that area , but not the one responsible for the actual killing , " said @entity82 , sheriff of @entity83 , @entity73			1
the navy did n't explain why or how authorities believe @entity56 is connected to the case			2
but his arrest appears to be the first that officials have publicly tied to @entity4 's killing			1
" if this is , in fact , true that he was involved , " @entity82 said , " it 's a welcome sign that the @entity15 government is trying to solve the killing of yet another @entity16 citizen on @entity15 soil			1

they are n't in @entity115 , they are n't in @entity116			0

" suspect 's alleged ties to high - profile crimes another @entity29 leader captured some @entity15 reports monday about @entity56 's capture mentioned his alleged ties to @entity4 's killing			1
but his arrest drew national attention for his alleged connection to some of the region 's most high - profile crimes , including the 2010 massacre of 72 migrants in @entity209 , in addition to other slayings , mass graves and large - scale prison breaks in northern @entity15			1
@entity56 is accused of leading the @entity29 in the @entity15 states of @entity209 , @entity216 and @entity217 , authorities said			1
@entity15 officials also said monday that he is suspected in " the execution of more than 50 people by his own hands in different parts of the country			2

@entity82 , the @entity83 sheriff , has said there were reports of fishermen on the lake being warned away from the @entity15 side as long as a year before @entity4 's shooting			1
@entity235 has eked out about possible suspects in the case			0
but information on the investigation has seemed scarce			0
last year , @entity40 sued the @entity240 , the @entity241 and the @entity78 in an attempt to get answers and find out why no one had been brought to justice in her husband 's killing			2
all three lawsuits were dismissed this year after settlements were reached , according to court documents			0
but the case has remained unsolved			0
" it did n't happen in the @entity16 , " @entity82 told @entity0 last year , adding that @entity15 authorities have " somewhat of a zero solvency rate , and a zero conviction rate			0
