-- a @entity2 judge friday denied @entity4 's request to be included in the state 's newly revamped women 's health program			1
judge @entity7 said he denied the organization 's request for a temporary injunction because it was unlikely @entity4 would win at trial , since federal funds are not at issue in the case			1
" if , as plaintiffs argue , a successor program must be @entity18 - funded then the only legal remedy would be for this court to shut down the state - funded women 's health program , not to order the inclusion of @entity4 , " judge @entity7 wrote in the ruling			1
@entity2 lawmakers applauded the ruling			0
" this is great news for @entity2 women and further proves that @entity4 's case attempting to derail the @entity32 lacks merit , " gov. @entity27 said in a statement			1
he added that the injunction request was " nothing more than a desperate move by an organization more concerned with obtaining taxpayer money than with helping women get care			0
with this ruling , our state can continue caring for @entity2 women , " @entity2 attorney general @entity44 said he was pleased the agency would not " skirt " the law			0
" the texas attorney general 's office will continue to defend the @entity52 's decision to prohibit abortion providers and their affiliates from receiving taxpayer dollars through the @entity32 , " @entity49 's communications director , @entity48 , said			2
a state law that went into effect with the new year requires the state to fully fund women 's health clinics with the exception of those that are affiliated with abortion providers			1
with that new law , @entity2 is no longer eligible for federal funding for women 's health and , therefore , @entity4 and other such establishments in the state will no longer be able to receive federal funding			1
previously , such organizations in @entity2 obtained 90 % of their money through the @entity70 and other federal funding			0
late last month , a @entity2 judge denied the group 's request for a temporary restraining order that would have extended the organization 's ability to participate			0
@entity4 and fellow plaintiff @entity78 of @entity79 , @entity2 , filed the request for a temporary restraining order seeking exclusion from the new law , arguing the organization provides preventative women 's health care not associated with abortions to nearly 50,000 @entity2 enrollees annually			1
the organization says more than 90 % of the services its clinics provide are for preventative measures aimed towards cancer screenings , birth control and testing for diseases			0
" governor @entity27 should not be able to decide which health centers a woman can go to for birth control , well - woman exams or cancer screenings , " @entity4 president @entity95 said			0
" this case is n't about @entity4 â € ” it 's about the women who rely on @entity4 health centers for basic care every day			2
ending funding for birth control , annual exams , or cancer screenings at @entity4 would hurt the millions of @entity109 women and families that rely on @entity4 health centers for health care , " @entity95 added			2
" that is why women and men in @entity2 and across the country strongly oppose attempts to deny funding to @entity4 health centers , and will fight with us to ensure @entity4 health center doors across @entity109 are open today and open tomorrow			2
" late last month , a @entity2 judge denied the group 's request for a temporary restraining order that would have extended the organization 's ability to participate .			0

new : judge says with no federal funds involved , @entity4 does n't have a case
@entity4 is excluded from the state 's @entity32
the law puts funding of women 's health clinics in state hands rather than federal
no clinics associated with abortion providers can receive any of the money
