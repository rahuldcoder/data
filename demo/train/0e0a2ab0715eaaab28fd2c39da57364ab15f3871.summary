-- if the best architecture aims at eternity , to paraphrase famed @entity5 architect @entity4 , then these new hotels are bound to be immortal			1
the 11 hotels on our list all opened within the last four years , and each is an example of awe - inspiring design in its own right			1
you can stay in a wave - like skyscraper in @entity15 , a stack of cantilevered cubes in @entity18 , or a hotel tucked into the wild cliffs of an @entity22 island			1
and , even better , it wo n't cost a fortune to spend a night in these architectural wonders			1
seven of the 11 are under $ 200 a night			1
see more photos of the hotels @entity28 ( @entity29 , @entity30 ) the two structures that make up the @entity28 each incline at a slightly different angle			1
or as the architects sweetly put it , the towers are drawn to each other , " yet seem a little shy			1
" in fact , the creative use of angles is employed both inside the property and out -- geometric angles give the exterior a filigreed look , while inside the hotel there are rooms where there are no 90 - degrees at all ( there are over 200 different room shapes in the 812 - room hotel )			1
the location , in the @entity29 neighborhood of @entity54 five miles from the city center , actually inspired the leaning - tower design			1
the buildings are so close to the airport that height restrictions dictate that they must not exceed 246 feet			1
011 - 45/3247 - 3000 , bellaskycomwell.dk , from $ 155 per night			1
jumeirah at @entity61 ( @entity62 ) @entity64 architecture firm @entity63 won the @entity66 's @entity65 for 2011 for this stunning $ 1 billion residential and retail center			2
the complex is made up of five towers on a beachside stretch on a peninsula in @entity62			2
constructing the buildings that now dominate the modern skyline posed structural challenges			2
the towers all curve , meaning each floor slab is a different shape			2
the 382 - room @entity80 hotel takes up 66 stories of one of the towers			2
888/645 - 5697 , @entity84 , from $ 192 per night			2
@entity0 : 12 elevators you have to see to believe @entity87 ( @entity88 , @entity89 ) perched atop a ridge , this collection of 10 freestanding , wood - clad modernist cubes , or " @entity92 " suites , opened in 2009			1
located in the rural mountain town of @entity98 ( a three - hour drive from both @entity100 and @entity101 ) , the sleek cubes create a beautiful juxtaposition with the groves of olive and almond trees that surround them			2
each suite has a sliding glass wall that opens onto a private terrace , and , inside , sparse interiors combine slate , copper - treated pine , and metal sheeting			1
the hotel incorporates some classic elements as well : a converted 14th - century hermitage serves as a communal area for guests			2
011 - 34 - 978/85 - 67 - 55 , consolacion.com.es , from $ 185 per night			2
@entity119 ( @entity120 , @entity22 ) architect @entity121 designed this lodge to blend into the dramatic surroundings of @entity120			1
tucked back behind cliffs , the hotel opened in 2008 and consists of 21 suites cascading down a windswept slope , following the natural curve of the land , each with floor - to - ceiling glass walls and sweeping views of the @entity119			1
suites were constructed from lightweight materials -- steel screw piles , timber framing , iron cladding -- that could be carried in to create minimal disturbance to nature , and which also could handle the challenge of building on precarious soil conditions ( several feet of sand atop solid limestone )			1
inside are environmentally sound sandblasted limestone floors and recycled spotted - gum walls			2
the off - the - grid location led to innovations such as sculptural containers for collecting rainwater			2
931/924 - 5253 , southernoceanlodge.com.au , from $ 1,000 per person , per night with a two - night minimum @entity152 ( @entity153 ) this trio of 55 - story towers opened in 2010 and hold an incredible 2,561 hotel rooms , plus a museum , casino , convention center , waterfront promenade , shops , and restaurants			2
architect @entity163 has said that his challenge " was to create a vital public place at the district - urban scale - in other words , to address the issue of megascale and invent an urban landscape that would work at the human scale			0
" his way of dealing with that was to design the complex around two central axes to give a sense of orientation			0
the towers are connected at the top by the cantilevered , two - and - a - half - acre @entity181 , home to gardens , 250 trees , a public observatory and a 492 - foot swimming pool -- all perched high in the sky like a fantastical cruise ship forever suspended in midair			0
011 - 65/6688 - 8868 , @entity190 , from $ 350 per night			0
@entity0 : @entity66 's 16 most picturesque villages @entity192 ( @entity62 ) this 499 - room hotel was the first to be built straddling a @entity195 racetrack ( it opened in 2009 and was renovated in 2011 to become a @entity196 )			1
the structure consists of a pair of 12 - story towers joined by a sweeping , 700 - foot curvilinear skin of glass and steel -- actually 5,800 pivoting , diamond - shaped glass panels that reflect the sky by day and are illuminated up by an led system at night			1
the architects ' aim was to reflect artistry and geometries associated with ancient @entity211 art and craft traditions , and from a distance the panels create the appearance of a spectacular veil			0
888/622 - 4567 , viceroyhotelsandresorts.com ; from about $ 210 per night			0
@entity217 ( @entity218 , @entity219 ) the piece de resistance at this 414 - room hotel of white polished stone and rough black stone is its attached conference center -- a glass structure with an exterior made up of 13 miles of semi-transparent stainless steel rods			1
they reflect the sky and water , radically change the skyline , and are what architect @entity232 describes as " a reminiscence of the @entity234			0
" the interiors of the hotel , which opened in 2011 , follow straight lines and geometric precision			0
800/333 - 3333 , @entity239 , from $ 155 per night			0
@entity240 ( @entity241 , @entity18 ) the 88 - room @entity240 was a striking addition to the folkloric village of @entity241 do @entity244 when it opened in 2008			0
the exterior is made up of reflective aluminum , black glass , and green stone , and the cantilevered design changes the shape of the hotel depending upon your vantage point			1
the contrasting interior consists of white finishes and materials including wood and stone			1
it 's all edged by a shimmering outdoor pool and surrounded by views of the @entity262 and @entity263			0
011 - 351/258 - 802 - 000 , @entity264 , from $ 100 per night			0
@entity265 ( @entity266 ) the 10 - story @entity265 sits on the site of a former parking garage in @entity271 's @entity270 neighborhood			0
neighbors were likely pleased with the swap when the hotel opened in 2011			0
the building looks like a massive metal sculpture -- perfect for the gallery - filled neighborhood -- with floors connected by catwalks and wrapped with stainless - steel mesh			0
the industrial façade holds 56 rooms plus two restaurants , a lobby café and two basement bars ; for urban escape , there is a roof deck with a pool , bar , and peaceful garden terrace			1
212/216 - 0000 , hotel - americano.com , from $ 295 per night			0
@entity0 : 12 hot springs worth traveling for @entity294 ( @entity295 , @entity296 ) rising like a geometric spaceship in the @entity298 is this distinctive hotel made of concrete , sheet metal , violet glass , @entity303 , and stone			1
@entity305 opened in 2011 and is divided into three parts , one of which seems to levitate above the ground , plus two side wings containing the 44 rooms			0

the striking hotel also has an impressive art collection , with works by @entity320 , @entity321 , and @entity296 sculptor @entity322			0
known for his large - scale installations , @entity324 's works here include an almost 30 - foot - tall stainless - steel man pushing against the exterior of the hotel			0

@entity331 ( @entity15 , @entity332 ) architect @entity333 literally made waves in a city full of iconic skyscrapers with her showstopper building			0
the 82 - story glass structure 's exterior has undulating concrete balconies resembling the swirls and ripples of nearby @entity343			1
such a unique design brought with it a unique construction challenge -- each floor plate is a different shape , which means a different concrete pour was required for every story			0
to manage it , the concrete was poured into a specially designed flexible metal edge that was reused over and over again -- an important detail for green architecture			0
much of the building is designated for private residences , but the 334 - room @entity355 opened on 18 floors in november 2011			1
