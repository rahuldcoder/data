-- @entity1 faces the possibility of being hit by a massive earthquake within the next four years , according to @entity5 researchers			1
the @entity7 's @entity6 predicts there is a 70 % probability that the capital 's metropolitan area will experience a magnitude - 7 quake within four years and a 98 % probability within the next 30 years			1
nearly one year ago , a magnitude 9.0 quake struck off @entity5 's @entity17 coast , triggering a devastating tsunami and aftershocks that left more than 15,700 dead , according to a government report in december on @entity5 's recovery from the catastrophe			1
about 4,500 were listed as missing			0
nearly 700 aftershocks registering magnitude 5 or greater followed last year 's quake , the government report said			2
the march 11 earthquake -- dubbed " @entity30 " after the region in which it occurred -- also damaged the @entity32 nuclear power station , where three reactors experienced full meltdowns , creating a nuclear crisis for a country already grappling with disaster			1
the research institute cited for its findings the @entity40 , which states that an increase in small tremors will likely increase the number of larger earthquakes			2
according to another paper published in september , the institute concluded that the quake ruptured a fault area nearly 500 kilometers in length and 200 kilometers wide offshore			2
the fourth strongest quake recorded in history , @entity30 caused abrupt stress changes in the upper plate and triggered widespread seismic activity throughout the @entity5 island			0
the northern part of @entity58 , in particular , saw a significant increase of shallow seismicity after the quake compared with the extremely low rate eight years prior , the researchers said			2
should @entity1 's inhabitants be worried ? the research institute 's findings carry great consequences for the 42 million people who live in the @entity1 metropolitan area			1
the @entity69 has estimated that a large - scale earthquake in the next few decades could result in 11,000 deaths and an economic loss of 112 trillion yen ( us $ 1.5 trillion )			0
its goal is to halve the estimated death toll and reduce the estimated economic loss			0
how precise are seismic forecasts ? @entity77 , a seismologist at @entity79 's @entity78 , called the @entity6 's findings " not at all unexpected , " given the level of seismic activity and their model			0
" seismologists can not predict with certainty when , where and how large the next big earthquake will be , " he wrote in an e-mail to @entity0			0
" however , it is possible to forecast the probability of an earthquake in a particular time range ( e.g. the next four years ) , location area ( e.g. the @entity1 region ) , and magnitude range ( e.g. greater than magnitude 7.0 )			1
" long - term forecasts use average activity levels from all known past earthquakes , geological data from fault displacements , and data about plate movement and deformation from very precise gps measurements and other methods to determine these probabilities			0
" what is the government saying ? the government 's @entity109 had put a 70 % probability of a magnitude - 7 quake in @entity113 , which encompasses @entity1 and @entity114 , within 30 years , based on long - term seismicity and hazard studies			1
scientists have already dubbed as " @entity118 " an expected 8.0 quake near @entity120 , where large quakes have historically struck every 100 - 150 years , according to the @entity122			2
the last one , a magnitude - 8.4 quake , occurred in 1854 -- nearly 160 years ago			1
according to @entity77 , the seismologist , the enhanced seismicity in the area affected by the @entity30 quake may fall towards normal levels and could affect the research institute 's findings			2
results for the six - month period after the quake would become available after this coming march 11 , the quake 's anniversary , he noted			1
why is @entity5 so prone to earthquakes ? the @entity5 archipelago and neighboring areas rest on or around four tectonic plates -- the @entity17 , @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity144 plates -- whose movements account for one of the most seismically active places on earth			0
can @entity1 withstand a 7.0 quake ? @entity77 said that while the area is a very active one seismically , building standards are high , therefore reducing the damage caused by earthquakes			1
buildings in @entity1 held up well in the face of the " @entity30 " quake			2
reinforced concrete and anti-seismic systems in buildings are among features that have helped absorb shocks when earthquakes occur			0
watch @entity1 's quake - proof communities " a magnitude 7.0 earthquake is very much smaller than the magnitude 9.0 @entity30 earthquake , " he wrote			1
" it would need 1,000 magnitude - 7.0 earthquakes to release as much strain energy as the magnitude 9.0			1
the fault rupture size is tens of kilometers , rather than hundreds of kilometers , and the fault displacement two to three meters rather than 20 to 30 meters			0
" serious damage could be limited , if it occurs offshore , he added			0
and the shallower the quake , such as within 10 kilometers of the surface , the more localized the damage			0
@entity0 's @entity182 contributed to this report .			0

forty - two million people live in @entity1 metropolitan area
institute : @entity1 faces 70 % probability of @entity189 within four years , 98 % chance within 30 years
government puts 70 % probability of magnitude - 7 quake in region within 30 years
march 11 quake and tsunami left more than 15,700 dead , government says
