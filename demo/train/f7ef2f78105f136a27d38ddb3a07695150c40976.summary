-- three years ago , when @entity1 moved from @entity2 to @entity3 for work , his marriage , and all the rights that went with it , dissolved in the transition			1
that 's because @entity3 -- a deeply conservative place -- is one of 38 states that bans marriages between same - sex couples			1
to make the move , @entity1 , 52 , and his husband , @entity16 , 59 , who got married in @entity17 in 2009 and have been together since 1991 , had to come to grips with the fact their relationship would no longer matter under the eyes of the law			2
they had to redo their wills and create new trusts to ensure their assets would be passed smoothly if one of them were to die			0
if they were put into long - term care in @entity3 , he said , the men would have to occupy separate rooms			2
they must file their taxes separately			0
and it 's almost impossible for them to use the word " husband " without comment			0
" well , who are you ? are you his driver ? " a nurse recently asked @entity1 when he was pushing @entity16 through a hospital in a wheelchair , as he related it to me			0
" no , i 'm his husband			0
" " oh , good @entity50 , " she said , dismissively			0
oh - good - @entity50 is right			2
how does it make sense that a couple 's love for each other would be recognized by one state and mocked in another ? for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people , the @entity57 has turned into a complicated mess of 50 @entity62 -- most of which discriminate against them			1
opinion : @entity57 is at a crossroads on gay rights for what other group -- with the possible exception of pregnant women seeking abortions -- are state borders so important ? if you 're @entity73 or tall or @entity74 or black or fat or old or poor or sad ... your fundamental rights as a human do n't change if you drive from the panhandle of @entity79 , where same - sex marriage is banned , into @entity81 , where it 's legal , or from the yellow plains of @entity84 , where employees can be fired because of their sexual orientation , to @entity87 , where @entity89 workers are protected from institutionalized bigotry			1
it makes sense speed limits and marijuana laws would differ			2
but not basic rights to dignity and inclusion			2
@entity57 deals with a host of issues that affect @entity89 people -- not just same - sex marriage -- in this sloppy , checkerboard fashion			1
you can explore some of them with @entity0 's handy new " lgbt rights calculator			1
" the point , to me , is that this patchwork of laws makes no coherent sense			1
some states allow same - sex couples to adopt. others , such as @entity111 , ban it			1
that leaves couples such as @entity115 and @entity116 -- whom i met on a recent trip to @entity111 , a state that , according to my calculations , ties for having the fewest protections for @entity89 people -- to fear that if and when they have a child , it may be difficult for both to maintain custody			1
some states protect @entity89 tenants from being evicted because of who they are			1
others , such as @entity128 and @entity129 , do n't seem to think that matters			0
some states let teachers talk about homosexuality in schools -- a healthy step toward ensuring future generations continue to be more accepting of all people			2
others , such as @entity139 , require teachers to mention " in a factual manner and from a public health perspective , that homosexuality is not a lifestyle acceptable to the general public and that homosexual conduct is a criminal offense under the laws of the state			1
" never mind that homosexuality is not a crime , as the @entity57 @entity150 held in @entity151 in 2003			1
and that about half the nation is cool with same - sex marriage these days , a percentage that only will grow with time			1
each state is so different we might as well put up signs on the borders			2
welcome to @entity3 ... oh , you 're gay ? ? ? please turn around			0
we can fire you for that here			0
... at least then the statutory inequalities would be visible			0
it seems @entity89 people have already taken notice			1
opinion : gay marriage , then group marriage ? a recent @entity170 survey of 206,186 people found states with more accepting laws and cultures tend to have higher percentages of openly @entity89 residents			1
@entity177 , for example , which allows same - sex marriage , has a 10 % @entity89 population			1
@entity181 , where laws and the culture ( " @entity185 " may have something to do with it , too ) are less favorable , is only 1.7 % openly @entity89			1
that may be because @entity89 people in conservative states are less likely to be open about who they are , particularly with a pollster , @entity191 and @entity192 write in an explanation of the survey on @entity170 's website			1
" it is also possible that @entity89 adults make conscious choices to reside in certain states rather than others , " they said , " but this possibility is difficult to assess and seems less likely			2
" plenty of gay people , @entity1 included , hope the @entity150 , which is hearing two cases related to same - sex marriage next week , soon will expand rights for same - gender couples in this country			1
but even in a favorable scenario -- if @entity212 's same - sex marriage ban is invalidated , and if the federal government starts recognizing same - sex marriages -- @entity89 people still will be subject to vastly different laws depending on where they live and work			1
folks like @entity1 , who moved from @entity2 to @entity3 , might as well be going from @entity220 to @entity221			0
@entity57 , of course , should n't give up their right to self - governance			2
but when it comes to civil rights issues , they have an awful history of clinging to laws long past their expiration dates			2
in 1967 , 16 states banned interracial marriage			0
@entity111 and others fought against racial integration in schools			0
but level heads , and courts , prevailed			0
i 'm no legal scholar , and i 'm not sure exactly what the best strategy would be for ensuring gay people are seen as equal under the law in all states			0
but i do know that it 's far too complicated right now			0
@entity1 , the man who lived in @entity2 , decided to move to @entity3 , where he had grown up , to take a job as executive director of the @entity248 , a statewide lgbt rights group			1
the nonprofit asked him , he said , if he wanted a corner office in the new community center the group is unveiling this month			0
it has nice big windows , the group told him			0
he worries he would be targeted			0
listen : voices from the @entity258 closet " we are seeing an uptick in @entity265 violence here , " he told me on the phone			0
( in one instance , last year , a @entity268 man said he was beaten up because he 's gay )			0
" and i think that 's part of the change process			0
when people feel like they 're really losing their grip or their hold , oftentimes violence results			0
" if , heaven forbid , @entity1 were to be victimized because of his sexual orientation and because he 's a leader of an lgbt rights group , @entity3 's state laws would n't treat it as a hate crime			1
on the federal level , as of 2009 , @entity89 people are explicitly protected			1
@entity284 , a two - hour drive to the north , lists lesbian and gay people as specifically protected from hate crimes , but does not extend rights to transgender people			1
sounds fair , right ? either we live in a nation that supports @entity89 equality or we do n't			2
but we ca n't have it 50 ways			0
the views expressed in this column are solely those of @entity298 .			2

@entity300 : lgbt rights break the country into 50 parts
the @entity150 is set to hear two same - sex marriage cases next week
@entity298 : even if court rules for same - sex marriage , a patchwork of laws remain
he says state borders matter more for @entity89 people than others
