in business , if one of our companies is failing , we take steps to identify and solve the problem			0
what we do n't do is continue failing strategies that cost huge sums of money and make the problem worse			2
it 's this kind of logic that underpins a new report published tuesday by the @entity14 , one that aims to take the debate on drug regulation to the next level			1
i 'm a member of the commission , and i am pleased to note that since our initial report in 2011 , international leaders and heads of state have increasingly echoed our calls for a major shift in global drug policy			1
@entity29 and @entity30 took the discussion from theory to reality in 2012 by becoming the first political jurisdictions in the world to approve the legal regulation of the production , distribution and sale of marijuana			1
@entity41 took it a step further last december by becoming the first country in the world to do so			0
this latest report , " taking control : pathways to @entity49 policies that @entity53 , " reflects a new evolution in our thinking			1
we not only reiterate the case for decriminalization , alternatives to incarceration , and greater emphasis on public health approaches , but we now also call for permitting the legal regulation of psychoactive substances			1
the reality is that the most effective way to advance the goals of public health and safety is to get drugs under control through responsible legal regulation			1
much can be learned from the successes and failures in regulating alcohol , tobacco , pharmaceutical drugs and other products and activities that pose health risks to individuals and societies			0
and drug regulation is not as radical as some might think			2
in fact , it does n't even require a fundamental reconsideration of established policy principles			2
there is a wide spectrum of policy options to control various types of drugs			2
at one end of this spectrum are illegal , criminally controlled markets subject to a full - scale war on drugs			2
at the other end are legal , unfettered free markets controlled by commercial enterprises			2
both of these options are characterized by an absence of regulation , with governments essentially forfeiting control of the drug trade			2
what 's needed are appropriately regulated legal drug markets			1
true , the importance to public health of legally regulating drugs comes not because they are safe , but precisely because they can be dangerous and pose serious risks			0
yet however dangerous a particular drug may be on its own , its risks increase dramatically when it is produced , sold and consumed in an unregulated criminal environment			0
putting accountable governments and regulatory bodies in control of this market can significantly reduce these risks			0
when thinking about how to best reduce the harms of drugs , alcohol prohibition in @entity127 is a lesson in unintended , disastrous consequences , as i wrote in 2012 on @entity131 on the anniversary of the end of alcohol prohibition , that policy prompted an increase in consumption of hard liquor , organized crime taking over legal production and distribution , and widespread anger with the federal government			1
since the war on drugs began in 1971 , over $ 1 trillion has been wasted and the @entity127 has the highest prison population in the world			2
some of these prisoners , from @entity148 , shared the stage with me in may during @entity152 's first @entity151 talk at a prison : while it was encouraging to see their anti-recidivism efforts and preparation for productive lives after prison , we should not be overcrowding prisons in the first place with people who need treatment and people who are nonviolent offenders			0
under prohibition , no product controls exist			0
illegal drug markets are driven by economic processes that encourage the production and supply of more potent -- and therefore more profitable -- drug preparations			1
effective regulation could help gradually reverse this dynamic			0
in the @entity127 and around the world , ending drug prohibition is being openly discussed			1
elected officials , businessmen , physicians , educators , civil society and religious leaders are breaking the taboo and engaging in debate about common sense alternatives including reducing the harm done by existing drug policies			1
law enforcement officials such as @entity189 district attorney @entity188 support the upcoming @entity191 and @entity190 , which @entity152 will vote on this november			0
if a majority says " yes on 47 , " nonviolent drug crimes will be treated as a misdemeanor , reducing prison overcrowding , focusing law enforcement to go after violent criminals , and freeing up $ 1 billion over the next five years from prisons to education and health care			0
imagine the possibilities when drugs are treated like a health issue , not a criminal issue			0
the one thing we can not afford to do is to go on pretending the war on drugs is working			0
@entity152 has a chance to reverse the harm done to its communities and its fiscal health by failed drug policies			1
more voters deserve opportunities to support alternative approaches to public safety , health and education that go hand in hand with the responsible regulation of legalized drugs			0
if drug policy , which costs $ 100 billion annually , were my business , i would call it a failure and shut it down before it ruins more lives			1
it 's time to apply that sort of thinking to our failed drug policies			1
