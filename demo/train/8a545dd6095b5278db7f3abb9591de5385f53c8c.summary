@entity0 -- i would n't necessarily call myself a true germaphobe , but if entering a domestic partnership with a bottle of @entity6 were legal i 'd certainly consider it			1
perhaps this is that slippery slope they 've warned us about			1
i 'm one among the insane masses who is chronically over-sanitizing himself because -- whoa -- it 's possible that a lone speck of someone else 's butt germs somehow drifted into my three - foot personal safety zone and is now infecting my life with disease and disgust			1
this , says the guy who will happily eat an unidentifiable rolling tube of meat under a heat lamp at a @entity27			2
" and , uh , how about three of those things			2
" " sir , they 've been there for 16 hours			2
" the point , here is that bathrooms gross me out , and people gross me out , and , though it 's all completely irrational , this mild phobia is getting to the point where , for safety , i may have to consider wearing pants in public			2
of course , the biggest concern for most germaphobes is the dreaded public bathroom			1
while many people in the world would be overjoyed just to have public bathrooms , here we 're socially conditioned to be a little worrisome of any place where another human being and his lunch burrito may have had their final intimate encounter			2
however , in @entity0 that soon may not be a problem			1
a company called @entity59 and @entity60 is aiming to change all that with upscale , private bathrooms			1
the idea is this : customers pay a yearly $ 15 membership fee			1
after that , they can then purchase different packages that range from three days ( $ 24 ) to six days ( $ 42 ) to 10 days ( $ 60 )			1
and this includes free use for up to three children under the age of 18			2
unfortunately , if you have four kids , it 's like a really bad remake of " @entity76			2
" " @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 ... let 's go inside and use the potty			2
@entity83 , @entity82 , good luck out there			2
" @entity59 's founder , @entity86 , explains why this might be perfect for tourists			2
" everyone who visits @entity90 needs a home base , " he says			2
" we will keep building locations as membership grows , so anyone can have a home base in every section of town they find themselves			1
" right now , the plan is to launch three flagship posh locations this summer , situated near the @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105			0
so , being that i was in @entity0 for a work trip , i decided to visit one of these areas to see just what kind of options already exist			1
and i started right in the heart of it all at : @entity105			0
on the main level of the terminal , i did n't immediately see any signs for public bathrooms			0
the floors could be cleaner , and it had a slight odor of asparagus , but the loo at @entity105 is certainly passable considering thousands of people pass through each day , and some of them may have had shepherd 's pie for lunch			1
i 'm also told there is a super ( no longer ) secret women 's bathroom in the @entity136 station master 's office			1
the secret men 's bathroom is on @entity139			1
now , it 's worth mentioning , of course , that the @entity105 @entity59 and go location wo n't be directly in the terminal			0
it 's going to be near the terminal			0
thus , i decided to get outside and do a full lap of the property -- one time around the block -- vowing to stop in five different private establishments to see if i could make use of their facilities without being a customer			1
which is sort of a debatable practice			0
last year , @entity155 ran a poll on whether restaurants should allow non-customers to use the bathroom			1
about 36 % said yes , but only if the individual was in obvious discomfort			0
surprisingly , only 12 % said flat - out no. so , looking back on it , i do n't feel that bad , and , amazingly ( at least at 3:30 pm on a wednesday ) there was absolutely zero trouble finding a place that would let me use the toilet			0
i even had a backup line to express my desperation -- something about a bad street - cart gyro			0
but i definitely went five for five , dressed in jeans , a wool hat and a puffy winter coat			0
which is to say schleppy			0
and for those of you keeping score , know that i rated the bathroom at @entity183 a 9.5 out of 10 based on cleanliness , smell and lack of other people			1
that last part was important			0
and so does the founder of @entity59 and @entity60			0
" i unabashedly admit that i 'm bathroom - shy			1
i do n't want to hear anyone else 's business , " @entity86 says			0
which is why the bathrooms at @entity59 will be soundproofed with music , solid core doors and sound - deadening walls			0
there also will be some heavy duty ventilation			0
but as the name suggests , @entity199 and @entity60 will be more than just bathrooms			0
members will also be able to stow their bags in secure lockers or just have a quiet rest in a comfortable chair			1
but the big question is whether this business model will actually work			0
however , @entity86 is confident that if he builds it , members will come			1
" i have yet to talk to anyone who prefers a dirty bathroom , " he says			1
" it will be profitable if there are enough people like me that do n't like lugging business presentation materials , shopping bags , diaper bags , etc. around the city			0
" of course , if it does n't work , there 's always @entity139 32			0
follow @ @entity226 on @entity227 .			0

for a small fee , a new startup will offer visitors to @entity0 a clean , private bathroom
yearly membership costs $ 15
members can then purchase day passes which cost about $ 8
