@entity0 -- i took a long stroll through the cavernous @entity4 , just off @entity5 , this month			2
it was the first time i went though the museum without breathless @entity10 yanking me around , impatient children or a looming deadline			2
the place was packed , not with tourists , but mostly with @entity14 schoolchildren			1
they were led around by amazingly patient guides explaining the most minute of details about every little bit and piece on display			2
a few of the schoolchildren were n't listening very closely , but most were paying attention			0
they clearly did feel a connection , at some level , with these ancient pharaonic artifacts			0
they must have recognized , in those ancient faces , their ancestors			0
certainly , if you look closely at some of the more lifelike statues , you will see faces identical to the faces you see every day here			0
there are some in @entity14 , however , who seem hell bent on repudiating , indeed destroying , the link between @entity14 's distant past and its messy present			1
opinion : @entity45 tomb attack is an attack on our humanity @entity49 , a jihadi sheikh with a history of radicalism , appeared on the private @entity14 tv channel @entity52 2 saturday evening and declared that if he and his ilk ever came to power , they would not hesitate to destroy the @entity56 and the pyramids			1
he 's no stranger to the notion of vandalizing ancient artifacts , boasting to the show 's host , @entity60 , that while in @entity62 , he took part along with the @entity64 in the demolition of the @entity66 in march 2001			0
his threat was met by @entity60 and the other two guests with shock			0
just to be clear , @entity60 asked the same question three times			0
@entity60 : " am i going to wake up tomorrow to find that , just as you did with the statue of @entity75 , that you have demolished the @entity56 and the pyramids ? " @entity49 : " that is dependent upon abilities and possibility			1
according to our @entity81 , every pagan and idol must be destroyed			2
" @entity60 : " if you are in power , will you destroy the @entity56 and the pyramids and all the pharoanic statues and all the pharoanic artifacts ? " @entity49 : " everything , if it is a pagan statue or idol , that is worshiped or suspected to be worshipped , or is worshipped by one person on @entity90 , must be destroyed			1
we , or someone else , must destroy it			2
" @entity60 : " so you would destroy the @entity56 and the pyramids ? " @entity49 : " yes , we will destroy them , if they were worshipped before or afterwards			1
" one of the guests , writer @entity98 , seemed repulsed by this and told the sheikh : " you do n't know the history of your country well			2
those pharaohs were the first to know religion in the world			0
" @entity56 and the pyramids , he continued , " are mankind 's heritage and not the property of @entity14 alone			1
they are the property of all mankind			0
" the sheikh was unswayed			2
@entity115 's threat inspired @entity0 's prolific blogger , known simply as @entity117 , to write a blog on her website , @entity120 , titled " visit the pyramids while you can ! ! " the @entity123 , born in rapture and enthusiasm , now resembles @entity126			2
@entity127 sprang forth , but so did extremism , demagoguery , crime , disorder and fear			0
and no one has come up with a way to put them all back in the box			0
in the days of @entity138 , everyone knew the extremists lurked on the dark , outer fringes of @entity14 society , but most kept a low profile , were behind bars or holed up in @entity62 or @entity144			1
in the new @entity14 , they 've come out of their cells and back from exile , and like @entity49 , rant on national television or make inflammatory speeches in @entity5			1
@entity14 have heard this all before -- that the pyramids and the @entity56 are pagan monuments and idols , and must therefore must be destroyed			1
there was a widespread rumor last year that a @entity159 ( ultraconservative @entity158 ) leader was advocating covering the monuments in wax but that proved to be spurious			1
it 's no secret , however , that the extremists here do n't like what these ancient monuments represent -- proof that magnificent human achievement is not the monopoly of any one religion or race			0
in fact , @entity49 is not the first one to call for the destruction of @entity14 's ancient landmarks			1
back in 1378 , an equally zealous @entity158 mystic took offense at the @entity56 and took it upon himself to try and demolish it			1
there are several versions of what happened next			0
some stories say a flash flood ensued , and villagers , fearing a pharaonic curse , promptly lynched him			0
other accounts say he was charged with vandalism and subsequently executed			0
the point is that the @entity56 , minus its nose , is still here .			1

@entity194 sheikh tells @entity14 tv he might destroy pyramids if in power
anything " worshipped by one person " must be destroyed , @entity199 says
a zealous @entity158 mystic tried to demolish @entity56 in 1378
