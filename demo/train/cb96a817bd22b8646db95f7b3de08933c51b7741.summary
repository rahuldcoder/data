-- when it comes to social media 's heavy hitters , there are no bigger players than @entity6 or @entity7 , right ? not if you 're in @entity9			1
mobile network @entity10 claims to have nearly 10 million users in the country , making it @entity9 's most popular social media platform by far , eclipsing @entity6 's six million users and @entity7 's 1.1 million subscribers			1
founded seven years ago by @entity17 - born software developer @entity16 , @entity10 has grown from an instant messaging application into a global mobile social network			1
the handset - agnostic network is tapping @entity9 's booming mobile market to serve a growing community of users and developers			1
@entity10 users can chat with their contacts , exchange photos and use a digital currency to buy virtual goods , while aspiring entrepreneurs can find a large audience for their applications and services			2
speaking to @entity0 before his recent resignation from the business he bought in september 2011 , former ceo @entity36 - @entity35 said he was still astonished by the power of mobile and how engaged the millions of @entity10 users are			1
" firstly they 're looking to meet people , secondly they 're looking for attention , they want to be heard or want to be seen , " said @entity35			2
" and lastly , people are looking to have fun , they 're looking for entertainment and there 's only one thing in their life : the cell phone -- there 's no @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 or tv , there 's just the phone and @entity10 is that escape			1
" the company says its users transfer between 500 and 850 million messages every day			0
that 's roughly double the number of tweets sent daily on a global basis			2
the average user now spends 85 minutes a week using @entity10 and logs on up to four times a day			2
@entity35 says the statistics prove that the growing popularity of mobile internet has transformed the way people communicate across @entity9			1
" before mobile @entity9 really was a dark continent -- i mean literally people could n't communicate , " @entity35 explained			1
he added : " in @entity9 17 years ago , before mobile phones came along , there were five million phones out of a population of 35 million people			1
now there are 60 million phones out of a population of 60 million people			0
" so literally , with the advent of mobile , it 's gone from almost a billion people not being able to talk to anyone except those they see , to being able to talk to anyone regardless of where they are			2
" so that 's the first revolution			2
no existing cable operator or tv player or @entity102 -- there 's nothing , there 's just mobile			0
" the other thing is the fact that credit cards are just non-existent			0
you 'll never build a big business by billing people via credit cards in @entity9 and probably in all emerging markets , and again that problem is being solved within an @entity116 context by trying to build the systems to sell prepaid airtime			1
" @entity119 succeeded in that because it unlocks the communications grid of the continent			0
the next step is to unlock the economic grid via mobile payments			0
" so how does @entity10 make money ? its primary revenue is n't generated through advertising , which is unusual compared to other social networks			2
instead it makes most of its money by selling content to its users			0
the site acts as a marketplace for hundreds of millions of micro-payments using its digital currency , @entity137			0
around 13 % of active users are spenders and use @entity137 to buy skinz , wallpapers , games and music			0

" i think they make 90 % of their money from advertising and 10 % from content -- we make 70 % of our money from selling third - party developer content , and 30 % from advertising			0
" @entity35 stepped down as ceo in october 2012 , citing a difference of opinion with shareholders			1
" while the shareholders and i share the same vision , we differ on how to get there , " he said in a statement			0
but although he 's left the company , @entity35 has described @entity10 as @entity9 's biggest tech success story -- and one he believes will continue to grow			1
" you can build a big global tech company @entity173			1
it does n't have to come out of @entity175 and i did n't know that before because i had n't seen that before , " he said			0
@entity177 contributed to this report .			0
