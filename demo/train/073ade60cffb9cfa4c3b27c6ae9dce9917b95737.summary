remember the obnoxious guy in the early - ' 80s mr. @entity2 commercial ? while cruising in a convertible with his friends , he uses the old @entity6 toy to come on to a pedestrian			0
" hey , good lookin ' , we 'll be back to pick you up later ! " he yells			0
this is not the way you approach a woman on the street			1
that point was brought home this week with a video posted by @entity20 on behalf of the anti-street - harassment group @entity22 ! @entity20 , inspired by the experiences of his girlfriend , tracked a volunteer , @entity26 , as she walked through @entity27 over the course of 10 hours			1
what 10 hours of street harassment in @entity27 looks like over the course of the video , men offer @entity26 greetings such as " damn ! " , " hey baby , " " what 's up , beautiful ? " and " sexy			1
" a few men follow her for blocks			1
others seem offended that she does n't respond			0
the reaction on the @entity41 has ranged from perplexity to outright anger			1
" unless one of these guys physical assaults you then they have every right especially if you do n't tell them to leave you alone			0
it does n't f * * * * * * matter if it 's scary or if it offends people , " wrote one commenter on the video 's @entity54 page			1
" i call bullsh * t. new wave feminazi persecution complex professional victim bullsh * t , " added another			0
on a @entity62 thread about the video , one person asked , " if a guy ca n't open a conversation with ' how are you doing today ? ' then what is he supposed to open it with ? " good question			1
being a nuisance there can be a fine line between flirtation and harassment , and it 's been used for comic effect in movies and television shows			0
" has anyone ever told you that you have the face of a @entity81 and the body of a @entity83 ? " asked @entity84 in the 1987 movie " @entity86			0
" sure , there are men and women who sometimes do want a quick fling with a passer - by			1
for them , maybe come - ons and catcalls work			0
still , only in a romantic comedy -- albeit one written and directed by the shrewd and flinty @entity95 -- would @entity84 's character make women swoon			1
as @entity101 has noted , " every time a man 's being nice to you , all he 's doing is offering d * * k. " which is why would - be lotharios should tread lightly			0
" you almost never approach it , " said @entity105 , @entity107 's urbane @entity106 columnist			0
" almost always , the guy is going to be making a nuisance of himself			0
i ca n't see a reason to ever greet a strange woman with anything more intrusive than a quiet , warm smile			1
" women have been saying this for years , of course			1
" street harassment has a negative effect on us all			1
no single man wants the actions of a few to be attributed to his entire gender , but studies show that male harassers impact victims ' perception and reaction to men in general , " wrote @entity122 in a 2010 essay			1
@entity122 observed that one catcaller was caught off - guard when a woman called him on his behavior			2
the man , abashed , said that he understood : he had sisters , and he would n't want them treated the same way			0
' talk to her , not at her ' @entity122 offers a simple solution : respect			2
" there 's a huge difference between harassing a woman and trying to start a conversation , " she wrote			1
" here are some tips : talk to her , not at her			0
treat her with respect : be aware of her personal space , ask her how she 's doing or what she 's reading instead of commenting on her body parts , look at her face instead of her chest			1
if she ignores you , drops eye contact , or walks away , back off			0
" it was n't rude of you to approach her , but she 's not being rude if she does n't want to keep talking to you , especially if you initiated conversation while she was running an errand , waiting for the bus , or on her computer at a coffee shop			0
" @entity163 , an activist and filmmaker who serves on the board of @entity166 , points out that the problem is one of dehumanization			2
" it 's not taking ( women 's ) word at face value , " he said			2
" men are socialized to think that women do n't really say what they mean			1
" moreover , he adds , society tends to judge women the way they dress			2
" we 're taught not to see women as human beings on the street , " @entity163 said			1
" the way they look totally supersedes their humanity			0
" opinion : attention , men : stop with the catcalls a way for ' dudes to blow off steam ' ? not all greetings are out of bounds			2
there is the matter of context , @entity105 says			0
early - morning runners and dog - walkers may offer courteous " good mornings " to one another as if they 're part of a big club , while doormen and shopkeepers do n't lose points for an appropriate , welcoming attitude			2
but commenting on a woman 's form as she walks past ? not acceptable			2
even the reaction men sometimes see -- a smile -- can be a defense mechanism to get the comments to stop , says @entity163			1
so why make comments at all ? " @entity220 is , in general , a way to relieve boredom during a dull workday and establish ' hey we are all straight ! ' amongst guys working together , " a " @entity218 " contributor explained to @entity219			0
" it was n't an attempt to hit on the woman or to be threatening			2
it was just a way for the dudes to blow off a bit of steam and be like ' we are men ! ' " on the @entity62 thread , which has drawn more than 6,500 comments , one man observed that lack of respect knows no gender			1
" as a fat guy who once walked around @entity27 for a day sightseeing i got so many comments , " he wrote			1
" ' lose weight , ass * * * e ! ' ' hey fatty want me to buy you a hot dog ? ' ' hey kill yourself you fat f * * * ' i would have been happy with just a ' good morning			0
' " in the right context , so would most people			0
" if your baseline value is showing respect to all people , everything will be ok , " @entity105 said .			2

video of woman being catcalled on streets of @entity27 gets huge reaction
activist : " we 're taught not to see women as human beings on the street "
men trying to meet women wonder : " what am i supposed to do ? "
proper response is to treat women -- and everybody -- with respect
