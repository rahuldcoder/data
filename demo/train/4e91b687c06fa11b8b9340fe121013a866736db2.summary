" the rev. @entity7 has invited them to appear at a leadership and compassion forum in his @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , on august 16			1
@entity7 , the author of the best - selling book " @entity18 " spoke with @entity0 's @entity19 by phone tuesday from @entity21 , @entity22			1
@entity19 : pastor @entity7 , how did you do it ? how did you convince both of them to show up ? @entity7 , @entity14 : well , @entity19 , they 've both been friends for a long time			1
i knew both @entity3 and @entity1 before either of them decided to run for office , had talked with them			2
both of them have helped me in the past with our peace plan and with -- they 've sent messages to @entity14 at some of our conferences			2
and so i just thought let 's -- you know , i might be the guy to get them together			1
so , i called them up and said , let 's do it			1
and they said , well , we 'll do it if you be the only questioner , if you do n't have a forum , do n't have a panel			2
and if you 'll ask all the questions , then we 'll do it			2
@entity19 : but they 're not going to be together			2
they 're going to be separate			2
these are going to be pastor @entity7 and @entity1 , followed by pastor @entity7 and @entity3			1
but there 's not going to be any interchange between the two of them , is that right ? @entity60 : yes			1
i 'm going to -- my plan is to bring them out on stage together at the beginning or at the end			0
but what i want to do is i want to let each of them talk without interrupting each other			0
and it 's not a debate format			1
there will be plenty of time for debates			0
what i want to do is get people to know the real person like i know them without a time barrier and a buzzer and a time for rebuttal			1
let them just speak what they need to say			0
@entity19 : the last time we spoke was right after you invited @entity1 when he was still running for the @entity2 presidential nomination			0
you got some criticism from a few fellow evangelicals out there			0
you called him in the interview with me an amazing , an amazing man , @entity1			0
could you see yourself supporting him for president ? @entity60 : well , i do n't support anybody for president publicly			0
you know , as a pastor , i do n't really think that 's my role			1
i have to shepherd both sides of the flock			0
and i have a church full of @entity2 and a church full of @entity109 and a church full of independents			1
so , i think they 're both amazing men			0
i 've known them for a long time			0
they 're both very , very different			0
they have both different theories of government , different theories of leadership , different approaches to life			0
and i -- what i do is i think , because i know them , i think i can set up an environment that people can actually say , oh , so that 's what that guy 's really like			1
and i think i can do that for both @entity3 and for @entity1 .			0
