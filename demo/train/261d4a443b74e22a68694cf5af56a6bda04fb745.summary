-- visiting @entity2 , it appears that @entity3 is well poised to sweep through the @entity2 , and probably @entity4 and @entity5 , on toward the nomination			1
but the campaign here suggests that , as he looks toward november , darkish clouds loom on the horizon			0
@entity2 voters love to surprise , and perhaps they will again this time			1
some 37 % remain undecided ( according to a @entity15 / @entity14 poll released friday ) , and one can never be certain how many independents will vote nor whom they will support -- especially with @entity3 making several unforced errors in the past 48 hours			1
still , he has been a steady front - runner for months : his @entity21 background makes him nearly a favorite son for many @entity2 republicans , and far more than in @entity27 , his message of job creation resonates in this hard - hit state			1
he is almost cruising to victory			0
so , the first question the press is asking is not whether he will win but by how much			0
if his vote total is in the mid- 30s or better and he wins by double digits , the media will call it a major victory ; if above 40 , he will " crush			0
" only if he goes below 30 , and that seems unlikely , will be he be seriously hurt			0
follow developments on the @entity41 's live blog the related question is how others will stack up behind him			0
if there has been real news so far in @entity2 , it is the lackluster performance of @entity48			1
typically , a candidate who came out of nowhere in @entity27 to nearly win ( what a difference those eight votes have made ) would have built on that momentum in the first primary state			0
but @entity48 appears to have plateaued and may even be fading			0
that means the conservatives still do n't have a darling to rally behind in @entity4 , leaving @entity3 once again to divide and conquer			1
meanwhile , the @entity59 team hopes that he can break through to second in @entity2 or at least be in a tight cluster with @entity62			1
that would give him a chance to compete elsewhere , especially in @entity5 ( where he first planned to have his headquarters )			0
but the fact that no one is yet challenging @entity3 for the brass ring this tuesday means he is closing in rapidly on the nomination			2
only one @entity70 ( president @entity71 in 1976 ) has ever won back - to - back in @entity27 and @entity2 , and never before has a nonincumbent @entity70 done it			1
with a victory in @entity4 , @entity3 would be 3 - 0			2
with most of his rivals already forced to scrimp and save , who could raise enough money to take him on after that ? even so , one can not escape the sense in @entity2 that if he is the nominee , @entity3 and his team still have serious work to do if they want to defeat president @entity82			1
that was instantly apparent sunday afternoon when @entity3 appeared with gov. @entity84 of @entity85 at a rally in @entity87 , @entity2 , drawing one of the biggest crowds of his campaign			1
while supportive of their guy , the crowd seemed relatively quiet , almost subdued , a sharp contrast to the electric rallies that @entity96 and @entity82 held four years ago			2
granted , the @entity97 were locked in a much closer race			0
but several veterans of @entity2 politics say that the energy is n't flowing as it has in years past			2
that is consistent with a @entity104 poll announced monday that found only 51 % of @entity70 and @entity70 - leaning voters nationwide rating this year 's candidates as excellent or good , compared to 68 % four years ago ( and compared to 78 % on the @entity97 side in 2008 )			2
another striking ( and related ) impression on sunday came with the speaking lineup			0
@entity113 , as a special guest , @entity84 would have taken the microphone first , warmed up the crowd , and then introduced the candidate , who would turn up the juice and send people marching into the night			2
instead , @entity3 spoke first , delivering a fairly boilerplate homily before handing off to @entity84 , who delivered a barn - burner ( listening , one got the sense the @entity70 convention keynote may be in his future )			1
wisely , the @entity3 campaign prevented the narrative from becoming " @entity3 opens for @entity84 " by asking @entity127 to close out the evening , which she did so with warmth and grace			1
still , the odd sequencing begged the question that has been nagging the former @entity21 governor for what feels like centuries now : can he connect with voters strongly enough to win a general election ? the other issue that arises for @entity3 is whether he can unite his party behind him			1
we have seen for some time that this is a fractured , motley field of candidates , but , listening to different campaigns ( and their voters ) , it seems clear that , just as importantly , they may well represent a philosophically fracturing party			0
more than one united front , the @entity70 right now looks more like a group in the midst of a heated battle between at least three camps : the old - line , more moderate " establishment " @entity70 ( a group that clearly favors @entity3 ) , the growing libertarian movement ( exemplified by chief hero @entity62 ) , and the more communitarian , religious phalanx of social conservatives ( who propelled @entity48 to near - victory in @entity27 )			1
what casts the fissures in the party in such sharp relief is how little fondness these groups seem to have for one another : not only is it easy to imagine a typical @entity3 voter looking down his nose at a @entity62 candidacy , but evangelical voters are exactly the type @entity3 has so singularly struggled with ( as @entity175 notes , he even lost ground with them from 2008 to 2012 , judging from exit polls ) , while @entity62 and @entity48 themselves have appeared substantially more at odds with one another in the debates than either has been with @entity3			2
by contrast , the 2008 election on the @entity97 side , while hard - fought between @entity185 and @entity82 , was still a rivalry between two groups of voters who , in terms of policy , ultimately agreed on a great deal			2
despite the fact that common wisdom deems @entity97 the more diverse coalition , there was little doubt that the party 's voters would stand firmly behind whichever nominee was crowned			0
as with the 2008 race for the @entity97 , @entity3 's biggest advantage this cycle is that the various voters punching ballots in the @entity70 primaries do have one thing in common : they desperately want a new president in the @entity209			1
for many evangelicals and libertarians , opposition to @entity82 will ultimately outweigh distaste for @entity3 , if he wins the nomination -- so he is likely to be competitive as the nominee no matter what			1
but winning the presidency ( especially against a campaigner as able as @entity82 , who has been shoring up his own base of late ) requires generating enthusiasm from voters , and governing well requires generating even more			0
which underscores a serious concern that @entity3 and the president should share : that either of them , winning in a squeaker , would be hard - pressed to accomplish much with the country , and their parties , as divided as they are			0
both parties talk about a country in need of a level of policy change that would traditionally require overwhelming support from voters , but nothing approaching a mandate is in sight			0
so even if @entity3 is on the glide path to the nomination , he still has a lot more work to do			0
if he wants to challenge @entity82 and become a successful president , he would need to find a way to unite his ideologically fraying party , and he 's definitely going to need to summon enough fire so that @entity84 can start opening for him			1

@entity253 , @entity254 : @entity3 appears to have an edge in @entity70 contest
they say the question is how well he would fare in a race against @entity82
@entity3 wound up as the opening act for @entity84 in a @entity2 appearance
authors : @entity3 needs to show he can be the headliner
