-- @entity1 will announce the @entity2 2 next wednesday , as made rather obvious by invites sent out to press this morning			1
apart from the new @entity2 , that means one thing : speculation			2
i 'm not immune , so here 's my list of things i think will make it into an already capable machine			1
i have stuck to features , rather than things like cpu speed , as the internal specifics matter less than what they actually enable you to do			1
cameras @entity21 , this one			2
we 're almost certain there will be a front - facing camera for @entity25 and other webchat applications , but i really do n't care			1
i 'll use that for @entity28 once in a while and that 's it			2
what i want is a decent rear - facing camera , like that in the @entity34 ( not the crippled piece of junk in the @entity36 )			1
why ? because it would be so useful , and not just for photography			2
augmented reality , @entity43 , scanning things , snapping photos and then drawing on top of them , the list goes on			1
one of the things i took away from all the tablets i tried at @entity49 in @entity50 last week was just how good a camera is on a big device			1
it seems like it would be awkward , but the big screen is great for composing and the size turns out not to matter at all			0
speakers the single @entity2 speaker is n't bad , but for movies and music you really want something beefier , and preferably in stereo			0
the rumors point to at least one big speaker grille on the back of the @entity2 's case			1
currently i get around this with an assortment of @entity72 speakers around my apartment , but i 'd rather do without them			0
sd card slot this one would be purely for importing photos and video			0
basically , it would be nothing more than a built - in camera connection kit			1
the @entity1 's @entity81 is great , but it is one more thing to lose and carry			1
i use my @entity2 more and more for processing photos ( courtesy of @entity87 and @entity88 ) , and until i can send direct from my camera via @entity90 , a slot is a lot more convenient than yet another dongle in my bag			1
a better connector the 30 - pin dock connector is one of the worst things @entity1 has made ( the other is " all mice it has ever created " )			1
it is symmetrical , so it 's hard to put in the right way in bad light			0
it 's delicate ( the cord breaks easily where it enters the plug ) and worst of all , it 's huge			2
in fact , the @entity109 is barely big enough for the connector slot			2
the likeliest candidate for a replacement is @entity114 , or @entity1 's rumored implementation of it , @entity114 , which might show up in this week 's new @entity116			1
this could be a small port that could carry power and data of any kind			0
that in itself would be good enough , but you know what i 'd really like ? a @entity114 data - cable with a magsafe plug			2
that would be just about perfect			0
better case the size and weight of the current @entity2 are just fine			0
anyone who complains that a 1.5 pound sliver of aluminum and glass is too heavy needs to shut up and go join a gym			0
i keep mine in @entity1 's own case 24/7			1
this is partly to protect the screen , but mostly to stop me dropping it , especially when i 'm walking on crutches with it tucked under my arm			0
a little more friction on the back would help a lot			1
perhaps a plastic rear , or just a grippy coating			1
bonus : the screen this is a small request			0
i do n't want a retina display ( or rather i do , but i do n't want the current penalties of price and battery life associated with it )			0
all i want is a dimmer screen			0
the brightness at the top end is fine , but even at its dimmest setting , the screen is too bright for using indoors at night			0
it 's true , i keep my apartment fairly dim ( i call it " moody and romantic , " but you may call it " cheap " ) , but unless you keep your place lit up like an office , the screen glows a little too much			0
what about yours ? do you want a built in printer ? a near - field communications chip to turn your @entity2 into the world 's biggest wallet ? or even a flashlight ? let us know your suggestions , as ever , in the comments			2
