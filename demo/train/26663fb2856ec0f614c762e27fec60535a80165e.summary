-- @entity3 @entity2 wo n't support raising the federal government 's borrowing limit without new spending cuts from the @entity8 administration , and the @entity3 risks an unprecedented @entity10 default by refusing , house speaker @entity1 said sunday			1
speaking six days into a partial government shutdown and 11 days before the @entity12 expects to hit its statutory debt ceiling , @entity1 told @entity15 's " @entity14 " that he wants " a serious conversation " about spending , but no tax increases			1
asked if the @entity10 would default on debt payments unless president @entity8 makes concessions , @entity1 said , " that 's the path we 're on			1
" " the votes are not in the @entity3 to pass a clean debt limit " -- one with no conditions attached -- " and the president is risking default by not having a conversation with us , " said @entity1 , @entity23			1
but speaking on @entity0 's @entity32 , treasury secretary @entity31 said @entity34 is " playing with fire " by threatening to leave the @entity10 government unable to pay its creditors -- a risk he called " unthinkable			1
" " we 've never gotten to the point where the @entity10 government has operated without the ability to borrow , " @entity31 said			0
" it 's very dangerous			2
it 's reckless , because the reality is , there are no good choices if we run out of borrowing capacity and we run out of cash			1
" @entity31 said the government has been managing to make payments since may by shifting money around , but it will run out of those options on october 17			0
unless @entity34 votes to raise the debt ceiling , the federal government will be left with " a very , very short window of time " before it would have to stop cutting checks for @entity59 recipients or disabled veterans and would undermine the full faith and credit of the @entity10 government , he said			2
what 's up with the debt ceiling ? in the 2011 debt - ceiling standoff , @entity34 and the administration agreed to $ 2 trillion in across - the - board spending cuts over a decade			1
though default was narrowly averted , the crisis spurred one of the top three bond - rating houses , @entity71 's , to cut the @entity10 credit rating for the first time			2
government offices across the country shut down tuesday after republicans in the @entity3 held up the passage of a temporary spending bill , demanding changes or delays to @entity8 's signature health care law			1
more than 800,000 federal workers have been on unpaid leave since then			0
a @entity85 poll released last week shows a 72 % majority of @entity10 disapprove of the government shutdown , with more @entity10 blaming @entity2 lawmakers than @entity8			2
but @entity1 told @entity15 he does n't have the votes to end the standoff without the @entity2 conditions on the @entity92 , widely nicknamed " @entity92			1
" complete coverage : health care in @entity10 " i have 233 republicans in the @entity3 , and you 've never seen a more dedicated group of people who are thoroughly concerned about the future of our country , " he said			2
" they believe that @entity92 , all these regulations coming out of the administration , are threatening the future for our kids and our grandkids			0
it is time for us to stand and fight			0
" @entity8 and his @entity112 allies in @entity34 say all @entity1 has to do is to bring to the floor a @entity115 - approved measure that temporarily funds the government , let @entity112 and a handful of moderate @entity2 vote for it , and the standoff ends			2
but after similar rounds of brinksmanship over the last increase in the debt ceiling , in 2011 , and the expiration of the @entity127 tax cuts in december , the administration has refused to make new concessions to @entity2			1
" in 2011 , there was a very dangerous turn in the political debate in @entity132 , " @entity31 said			0
" you had the same 50 to 100 members who were really willing to default if they did n't get their way			0
i 've been through a lot of budget debates			0
i 've been through a lot of debt ceiling debates			0
never did i hear people who said , ' if it do n't get my way , it 's better to default			2
' that 's not acceptable now			0
" @entity3 @entity2 have responded by passing limited spending bills aimed at restoring funds to popular agencies , such as the @entity147 or the @entity148			1
senate majority leader @entity149 has refused to consider them , demanding that @entity2 agree to fund government operations in full -- leading republicans to blame the president and @entity149 , @entity153 , for the shutdown			2
do n't want to raise the debt ceiling ? get ready for austerity @entity158 sen. @entity157 , a tea party - backed @entity2 seen as the architect of the new impasse , told @entity0 that many previous congresses have attached conditions to debt - ceiling increases and accused @entity8 of hyping the risks of a default			1
he said @entity2 should demand " some significant structural plan and reduce government spending " as a condition of raising the borrowing limit , as well as " ways to mitigate the harms from @entity92			1
" after soaring to more than $ 1.4 trillion in 2009 , the annual federal budget deficit was expected to shrink below $ 650 billion in 2013 , according to the nonpartisan @entity174			0
but the total federal debt is nearly $ 17 trillion and is expected to go up by another $ 6 trillion by 2023 , the @entity174 predicts			0
among the reasons for the shrinking deficits are increased tax collections since january , when @entity127 - era tax cuts for top earners and a temporary cut in social security withholding were allowed to expire			0
@entity1 said that 's why he wo n't accept tax increases in any deal			0
" the president got $ 650 billion of new revenues on january the first ... now , it 's time to talk about the spending problem , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity190 contributed to this report .			1

default ? " that 's the path we 're on , " @entity3 speaker tells @entity15
@entity2 are " playing with fire " on debt limit , @entity12 chief tells @entity0
