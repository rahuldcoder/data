new details provide a clearer chronology about what might have happened to @entity3 between its takeoff and its last known spotting seven hours later			2
here 's how experts and officials have reconstructed key moments of the flight , which disappeared march 8 with 239 people aboard			0
12:41 a.m. : takeoff all tracking systems are working as the @entity14 takes off from the @entity16 capital of @entity17 , headed for @entity18			1
1:07 a.m. : @entity19 sends communication one of the plane 's communication systems sends what turns out to be its last transmission , according to @entity27 ceo @entity26			1
" it showed nothing unusual			2
the 1:07 a.m. transmission showed a normal routing all the way to @entity18 , " according to a statement from @entity16 's @entity34			1
the @entity35 and @entity36 is the onboard computer that collects information -- a lot of it -- about aircraft and pilot performance			0
it 's akin to computers in automobiles that track oil levels and engine performance			0
aboard aircraft , @entity19 computers measure thousands of data points and send the information via satellite to the airline , the engine manufacturer and other authorized parties , according to @entity56 aviation and airline correspondent @entity54			0
see maps of possible debris field , search areas the information is useful for operations , maintenance , scheduling and performance purposes , @entity60 said			0
1:19 a.m. : @entity67 check - in someone in the cockpit makes a voice check - in with air traffic controllers as the plane is apparently leaving @entity16 airspace and entering @entity75 airspace			1
initial investigations indicate it was the co-pilot , @entity3 , according to @entity27 officials			2
" all right , good night " were the final words from the cockpit , said @entity82 , a @entity16 civil aviation officer			1
the phrase " good night " is the radio parlance used by pilots when executing a handover from one airspace to another , @entity60 said			1
that happens a gazillion times , " @entity54 said			0
" ' all right , good night ' is a pleasantry at the end of radio communication			1
" it remains unclear , however , whether @entity75 air traffic controllers had any contact with the plane during the handoff , @entity60 said			2
1:21 a.m. : transponder off the plane 's transponder stops communicating at 1:21 a.m. , said @entity101 , director of the @entity16 @entity102			1
a transponder sends electronic messages from the plane : " squawks " to radar systems about the flight number , altitude , speed and heading			1
this is enormously useful information to air traffic controllers who are looking at scores of blips on their screens , and each blip is a plane emitting identifying information , thanks to the transponder			2
with the transponder off , " now the plane is flying blind from the ground 's point of view , " @entity54 said			2
" if there is radar there , the radar will see a blip , but they wo n't know who it is , where they are going			0
they will just now know it 's there			0
" that 's because the transponder is n't sending identifying information about the plane			2
shutting off the transponder is a simple turn of a switch in the cockpit , @entity60 said			0
" the air traffic controller should notice			0
i suppose it would cause alarm			0
... ( the information from ) a plane that you 're monitoring all of a sudden disappears , " @entity54 said			2
1:22 a.m. : plane disappears from @entity153 military radar @entity153 military radar is tracking the plane 's signal , but it disappears at 1:22 a.m. , a @entity155 spokesman told @entity56			1
1:28 a.m. : @entity153 radar picks up unknown aircraft the @entity153 radar station in southern @entity163 province picks up an unknown aircraft flying in a direction opposite to what @entity3 had been traveling , a @entity155 spokesman told @entity56			2
1:21 a.m. -1:28 a.m. : plane appears to change course the plane appears to have changed course in this time frame			1
the @entity16 government has not said when or if the plane was reprogrammed to fly off course			1
again , according to the @entity16 , the last data from the @entity19 at 1:07 a.m. indicated that it " showed normal routing all the way to @entity18			1
" about 1:30 a.m. : civilian radar loses contact with plane @entity16 air traffic controllers in @entity179 , outside @entity17 , lose contact with the plane over the @entity181 between @entity16 and @entity75 at coordinates 06 55 15 n and 103 34 43 @entity182 1:37 a.m. : expected @entity19 transmission does n't happen the @entity19 was supposed to transmit a half - hour after it last did so			1
therefore , it was supposed to transmit at 1:37 a.m. -- but it did n't , @entity26 said , so , the @entity19 stopped communicating sometime between 1:07 and 1:37 a.m. it 's a significant event : turning off @entity19 takes know - how , @entity60 said			1
if the flight were hijacked or a target of terrorism , cutting off @entity19 would be a strategic move because the system reports to satellites anything being done to the aircraft , @entity60 said			0
2:15 a.m. : military radar detection though the @entity16 plane is not transmitting information -- by @entity19 or transponder -- radar on the ground or elsewhere can still detect a plane in the air			1
according to a @entity16 @entity155 official , military radar tracked the plane as it passed over the small island of @entity204 in the @entity205			1
at this point , the plane was hundreds of miles off course			2
in fact , it was on the other side of the @entity211			0
military radar showed that it flew in a westerly direction back over the @entity211 , @entity16 prime minister @entity212 said			1
it is then believed to have either turned northwest toward the @entity216 or southwest elsewhere into the @entity217			2
this was the last time any civilian or military radar is known to have tracked the aircraft			0
the focus now is searching for the missing flight in the southern @entity217 , according to a @entity224 official			0
" the southern scenario seems more plausible , " the official said			0
the @entity16 military is handing over its raw radar data to @entity224 and @entity230 officials , apparently setting aside concerns about any sensitive military intelligence			1
@entity60 called this sharing of information a " huge " development in the case			0
" they do n't want anyone to know how good their radar is			2
they obviously decided that does n't matter , " he said			0
" we do n't know much about the @entity16 military and that has been one of the issues , " @entity54 added			1
" it appears that @entity16 was providing an interpretation of the analysis -- and not the raw data			1
now they are handing over the raw data			0
" 2:40 a.m. : @entity27 says it learns plane missing from radar @entity16 air traffic controllers told @entity27 at 2:40 a.m. that @entity3 was missing from radar , according to the airline			1
2:40 - 3:45 a.m. : @entity27 preliminary search during this time , the airline " sourced every communication possible to ( @entity3 ) to locate its whereabouts before declaring that it had lost contact with the aircraft , " the company told @entity56			1
" during this period of uncertainty , @entity27 needed to establish facts by contacting other air traffic controllers and aircraft flying within the same route , " the company said			0
3:45 a.m. : @entity27 issues alert @entity27 said it issued a " code red " alert that the plane was missing from radar			1
the airline said " code red " is when it declares that a crisis requires immediate deployment of emergency response plans			0
it said it took about an hour to issue the alert because it was trying to locate the plane and confirm that it was missing			2
to verify , it used various measures , including sending messages to the plane and awaiting a response			0
6:30 a.m. : plane should have arrived in @entity18 this was the time that @entity3 should have landed in @entity295 's capital			1
7:24 a.m. : public announcement of disappearance @entity27 announces the plane 's disappearance on @entity300			2
8:11 a.m. : satellite ' handshakes ' @entity212 revealed that a satellite tracked the plane at 8:11 a.m. , more than seven hours after takeoff			1
@entity212 did n't provide details on the satellite tracking , but it appears that orbiters high above the ocean detected the plane as the satellite or satellites attempted a series of " handshakes " -- or electronic connections -- with the plane below , @entity60 said			0
it 's likely that the plane did n't complete the handshake because its communication systems were disabled , @entity60 said			1
nevertheless , the satellites would have been able to trace a plane flying below them and would have extended an electronic message equivalent to a hailing : " there 's a plane : hello , hello , hello ? do you have anything for us ? " @entity60 said			0
the @entity16 prime minister said the " raw satellite data " confirms the plane was @entity3			1
the @entity332 and the @entity333 , along with @entity230 's @entity331 , concur , @entity212 said			0
" due to the type of satellite data , we are unable to confirm the precise location of the plane when it last made contact with the satellite , " @entity212 said			0
authorities believe the plane was in one of two flight " corridors " : a northern route stretching to northern @entity153 , @entity345 and @entity346 in @entity347 or a southern route toward @entity349 and the southern @entity217			0
growing number of airplanes scour southern @entity217			0

the @entity16 government has not said when or if plane was reprogrammed
a 1:07 a.m. transmission showed a " normal routing all the way to @entity18 "
co-pilot believed to have checked in by radio , ending with " all right , good night "
two communication systems stopped transmitting *shortly* after takeoff
