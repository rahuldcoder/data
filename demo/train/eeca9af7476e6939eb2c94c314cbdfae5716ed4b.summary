-- president @entity2 's speech to the @entity3 public monday night was eloquent and forceful			1
but given the odds arrayed against him -- some of his own making -- the persuader in chief likely wo n't make the sale			2
indeed , it 's likely that none of the other great communicators and explainers -- @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 -- could have either			0
and here 's why : @entity19 was right impersonating @entity20 in " @entity21 , " @entity19 makes a remark that sums up @entity2 's challenge : " who are you going to believe , me or your own eyes ? " the @entity3 people are their own experts this time around on what constitutes a vital national interest for the @entity3 and what they want done about it			1
after two of the longest and most profitless wars in @entity3 history , the public has a more discriminating assessment of what 's worth fighting for and what 's not			1
and , deeply dismayed by the standard for victory -- when can we leave , not how do we win -- most @entity3 rightly see a @entity3 military strike on @entity44 as an imperfect option that is likely either to be ineffective or to draw the @entity3 into another country 's civil war			1
one speech could never overcome the skepticism and doubts left by a decade of two pointless wars			0
and this one did n't			0
it 's not that @entity3 are unmoved by the president 's heartfelt descriptions of dead @entity44 children gassed by , the administration says , president @entity59 's murderous forces ; it 's that their priorities lie elsewhere			1
but it 's @entity3 's broken house that 's in need of repair , not someone else 's			1
and no amount of false analogies to @entity67 and appeasement will sway them			0
they know what they see , and it 's not compelling enough to justify the uncertainties of a military strike			2
the president 's words last night did n't allay those doubts			2
opinion : @entity2 's speech a model of persuasion @entity2 's @entity44 policy is a @entity85 movie over the past week , one got the feeling that every day another door opened on the @entity44 issue with yet another surprise			1
the twists and turns did n't help the administration 's case for clarity and consistency , which is so critical to providing the background of a speech to the nation			1
indeed , events of the past week made the president 's task much harder			0
first , after a buildup to one of the most widely telegraphed military actions in the history of warfare , the president surprised the nation by deferring military action while he sought an authorization to use force from @entity113			0
that was followed by an off - the - cuff remark by secretary of state @entity116 on how @entity59 could preempt a military attack by turning over all his chemicals weapons			0
the next surprise was a @entity121 endorsement of @entity116 's idea -- and then @entity44 jumping aboard the peace train			1
the result : on the eve of the president 's speech -- presumably aimed at making the case for a military strike -- the momentum had shifted away from war as the @entity132 , the @entity133 and the secretary - general all try to figure out how to make peace and take @entity59 's chemicals off line			1
the @entity3 public -- already confused as to whether the strike would be " unbelievably small " ( in @entity116 's words ) or , in the president 's words , more robust ( " the @entity3 military does n't do pinpricks " ) -- could be forgiven if it was a tad bewildered			1
read the speech overselling the risks of not acting much of the president 's speech dealt with the consequences of not acting militarily in the face of the largest single deployment of chemical weapons against civilians since @entity154 used them against the @entity156 in 1988			2
there 's no doubt that doing nothing would broaden @entity59 's margin to use these weapons again if he felt it necessary			0
but we need to be clear : this regime is engaged in a fight to preserve itself and will do whatever is necessary to stay in power			0
a @entity3 strike would have to be extremely punishing to deter @entity59 from using these weapons and extremely comprehensive in its scope to degrade @entity59 's capacity			1
the president ca n't make his case by playing down the severity of any @entity3 response			1
the other risks of inaction -- deterring @entity178 from nuclear weapons or suggesting that the @entity3 is threatened by these weapons -- just do n't add up and are n't compelling			1
indeed , should @entity59 be weakened or lose control , these chemical weapons might well fall into the hands of @entity184 and other jihadist groups that could use them directly against the @entity3			2
opinion : speech aims to keep heat on @entity44 our cardboard conception of leadership even under normal circumstances , a single presidential speech to persuade @entity3 to back a military strike would be a tough sell			1
presidential speeches rarely move the needle much on an issue like this			0
we have this artificial conception of our president 's capacity			0
if only the president could make the case with powerful logic , he can indeed persuade			0
the only thing that 's missing is leadership			0
but that 's really not the way it works			0
presidents are more often prisoners of events			0
the great ones -- @entity216 , @entity15 -- are fortunate ( if that 's the right word ) to have circumstances that allow them to do so			0
and they intuit and extract opportunities from those circumstances that allow them to lead			0
@entity2 does n't have these circumstances			1
he faces a public that is deeply skeptical of attacking another @entity227 / @entity226 country ; a divided and skeptical @entity113 ; and an international community that fears military action			2
and he confronts this environment with a military option that he himself does n't really believe in either			0
there 's no real sense of urgency or emergency , partly because the president has willfully downplayed that sense of crisis			0
@entity2 seeks support for attacking @entity44 while pursuing diplomacy @entity2 is an ambivalent warrior			1
he fashions himself the extricator in chief charged with getting @entity3 out of profitless conflicts , not getting them into new ones			2
monday night 's speech reflected a man who on one hand would like to be rescued by a diplomatic solution to a problem he himself knows ca n't be resolved by military force and on the other , one who realizes he has a very bad military option if he must go forward			1
and as a consequence , what was hyped as a major speech really could n't be , in large part because there was nothing to decide and no urgency to do so			2
@entity113 is n't going to vote this week ; the @entity3 is n't going to war soon ; and @entity267 's diplomacy from @entity121 has yet to play itself out			1
indeed , right now the president ca n't be the decider in chief because there 's nothing to decide			2
for now , @entity2 -- along with the rest of the country -- is stuck in limbo between a war he clearly does n't want and diplomatic approach he knows faces long odds			1
and no presidential speech could free him or the country from that predicament			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity282			2

@entity284 : @entity285 could not sell skeptical @entity3 on need for action on @entity44
he says speech could n't *convince* war - weary citizens that @entity3 interests at stake
he says @entity2 's handling of @entity44 issue has not inspired *confidence*
@entity282 : a strike would have to be broader than @entity2 describing , and @entity3 fear this
