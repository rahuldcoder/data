it 's too easy to let @entity1 off as simply " @entity1			1
" it 's true the state has magical desert vistas , @entity6 playgrounds and charming adobe communities that predate @entity9 ' arrival by a few thousand years			1
but there 's an undeniably eclectic and occasionally dark side to the 47th state as well			1
in @entity14 , residents see ufos with frightening regularity			2
in @entity17 , they burn @entity18 , or " @entity20 , " at the stake every fall			2
and @entity21 , near @entity22 , is the first spot on the planet where humans detonated an atomic bomb			2
considering that @entity1 is essentially a bilingual state , where about one - third of families speak @entity28 ( some villagers in the northern mountains speak a dialect of 16th - century @entity28 ) , @entity1 often feels like a foreign country			1
add the interesting juxtaposition that it 's the fifth - largest state ( 121,589 square miles ) , but has a population of about 2 million people ( about half the population of @entity38 ) , making it one of the least densely populated states in the country			1
all of which means that there is quite a lot of space to explore			2
you might be surprised by what you find			2
@entity47 is served 365 days per year			1
walk into any @entity1 restaurant , order an enchilada or burrito and the waitress will ask the inevitable : @entity52 , green , or @entity47 ? that 's local parlance for " how do you prefer your chile ? " the spicy , capsaicin - rich sauce made from the official state vegetable smothers most everything that comes out of a @entity1 kitchen			1
whether you prefer spicy green , mellow red , or " @entity47 , " a combination of the two , the little - known secret about @entity1 chile is that red and green are one and the same			1
the difference is how ripe the pepper is when picked			2
drive about 65 miles northwest of @entity17 on @entity73 84 , past @entity74 , the iconic flat - topped peak painted by @entity76 , and @entity77 , where portions of " @entity79 , " " @entity80 " and " @entity81 " were filmed			1
then take a left on @entity83 151			2
at the end of the 13 - mile - long road is @entity87 's tap room , where you 'll find the smooth , cool tang of a classic @entity91 ale			1
the @entity93 monks grow their own hops to brew six of the best beers in the @entity96 under the label @entity98			0
beware : @entity99 has 9.2 % alcohol content , and beer is not allowed at vespers			0
reserve a free tasting at least 48 hours in advance			0
the wine industry here is older than @entity107 's			1
it all began in 1629 when @entity111 friar @entity109 and a @entity113 monk named @entity114 planted the first wine grapes in the @entity116 to use for communion			1
by 1884 @entity1 was producing almost a million gallons of wine annually			1
@entity120 raids in the 19th century and flooding in the early 20th century brought the industry to its knees , until a group of @entity126 investors began importing @entity128 hybrid vines to @entity1 to grow small boutique wineries			1
today , the state has more than 42 wineries that produce more than 700,000 gallons of wine annually			1
the @entity137 family , established @entity128 winemakers who moved to @entity1 to run an experimental vineyard in 1984 , grow grapes at 4,300 feet			1
the altitude must work magic			0
@entity137 's sparkling wines are some of the best in the country			0
not likely to stop for a sip in @entity1 ? try a @entity145 at the @entity146 or @entity147 in @entity148			1
@entity151 's @entity150 today and the buildings might be described as faded retro			0
flashback to the 1950s and this blacktop strip was the soul of @entity149 , the 2,400 - mile scenic highway that passed through eight states along the way from @entity159 to @entity38			1
at the height of " @entity149 's " popularity in 1955 , 98 motels lined @entity150			0
today one of the strangest corners is the intersection of @entity150 and @entity166 in downtown @entity151			0
due to a change in the road 's alignment in 1937 , this is where historic @entity149 ( @entity166 ) intersects with modern @entity149 ( @entity150 )			0
@entity17 is very high , very old , and contains a miraculous staircase			0
quirky and charming , @entity17 sits at 7,000 feet above sea level , making it the highest state capital in the country			1
it 's also eerily reminiscent of the @entity175 , especially the downtown plaza 's @entity176 , which was built in 1610 , more than 300 years before @entity1 became a state			1
the " @entity183 " is also home to a few miracles , like the @entity182 's circular wooden steps			0
built by an unidentified man who is said to have shown up at the chapel in 1879 with a donkey and a toolbox , his staircase has two 360 - degree turns , no visible means of support and wooden pegs instead of metal nails			1
some faithful at the time believed that the mystery man was @entity198			0
it 's still the @entity175			0
like many villages west of the @entity201 , @entity202 , in the northeast corner of the state , staked its claim as the " cowboy @entity206			2
" @entity208 once managed a goat ranch just outside of town and @entity80 , @entity211 , and @entity212 stayed at the @entity213 , famous for being haunted by the men who were murdered there			0
the outlaw @entity216 ( a relative of the legendary frontiersman ) murdered three @entity218 in the bar in 1876			0
more than a century later , new @entity220 are still allowed to openly carry a gun , no permit required , almost anywhere , including state parks and state and national forests , and restaurants that do n't serve hard alcohol			1
@entity231 is n't your typical sand			0
we may be getting hung up on a technicality , but the " sand " in these 275 - square miles of shifting dunes 15 miles west of @entity22 is actually gypsum crystals			2
( most inland sand is made from silica in the form of quartz crystals or coral			0
) that 's not the only reason @entity245 is surreal : 93 @entity247 oryx were imported from the @entity248 and set free between 1969 and 1977			0
today more than 3,000 animals , each weighing up to 450 pounds with horns that average 34 inches , roam the dunes			0
archaeologists have identified more than 25,000 @entity256 sites in @entity1			1
arrowheads are unearthed almost everywhere in the state , but for the most complete and mind - boggling perspective of these hunter - gatherers who thrived 10,000 years ago , visit @entity263 near @entity264			1
the park covers 33,677 acres and centers around @entity267 , where a mile - long hike takes visitors past petroglyphs and masonry walls built into a cliff face			2
the @entity256 cleared out of @entity273 sometime after 1250 , possibly because of drought , deforestation , crop failure , or internal conflict			0
the reasons are still not known			0
but to this day their ancestors are scattered across @entity1 in 19 @entity282 communities			1
one - thousand - year - old @entity282 , a multistory adobe one mile north of @entity282 , is considered to be the oldest continuously inhabited community in the @entity73			1
you do n't need lightning to be awed by " the @entity287			0
" in daylight the famous outdoor sculpture built in 1977 by @entity289 , appears to be little more than 400 stainless steel poles sticking out of the ground			0
but come sunset on a stormy @entity296 summer evening , the poles will provoke pyrotechnics that make hairs stand on end			0
even without lightning , the high desert sky at sunrise and sunset here at 7,200 feet on the edge of the @entity303 near @entity304 is breathtaking			0
make a reservation at least six months in advance to stay in the one rustic , three - bedroom cabin adjacent to the field through the @entity308 ( diaart.org )			2
@entity312 's mineral waters have worked wonders for thousands of years			0
ancestors of the native @entity316 tribes , 16th - century @entity28 colonizers , and ailing bodies in search of a miracle cure have all made the pilgrimage to soak in the geothermal water that flows from an ancient volcanic aquifer to the surface at the rate of more than 100,000 gallons per day			2
@entity96 of @entity282 , @entity326 officially became a " spa " 145 years ago , but it still has public @entity328 , @entity329 , @entity330 , and arsenic springs			0
for privacy , rent a brand - new @entity334 with kiva fireplace and a private soaking tub .			2

@entity47 is served 365 days a year in @entity1
the state has a longer wine - growing history than @entity107
new @entity220 may openly carry a gun , no permit required , almost anywhere
