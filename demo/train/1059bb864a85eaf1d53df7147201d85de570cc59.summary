officials say they have gone to great lengths to make sure nothing like last year 's attacks will happen			1

" we are aware that many people want to participate in some way in this year 's @entity50 as a display of support , " the @entity20 said in a statement			1
" but we ask that those who are not official participants to refrain from entering the course for the safety of the runners and themselves			2
" the anniversary scare at a memorial to mark the one - year anniversary of the bombings , one sight evoked memories of the gruesome attacks : suspicious bags near the @entity50 finish line			1
police spotted the bags on @entity70 -- not far from where two pressure - cooker bombs exploded a year ago			1
the first clue that something was amiss came when an officer spotted a man carrying one of the bags walking barefoot in the rain down @entity70			1
police said he became very vocal and started yelling			0
when asked what was in his backpack , the man told the officer it was a rice cooker , @entity79 superintendent @entity81 said			2

he was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct , disturbing the peace and possession of a hoax device , @entity81 said			1

keeping that in mind , police will double the number of officers on patrol from last year , with 3,500 scattered among the crowd			0
they will be aided by 100 additional security cameras and bomb - sniffing dogs			0
" in this world , you never eliminate risk ; you never bring it down to zero , " state police col. @entity146 told reporters last month			0
" but we are working very hard at reducing that risk level and managing it to the best of our collective abilities			0
" authorities have not disclosed how much the extra security will cost			0
all they will offer is that it will be " much greater " than last year 's cost			1
but this year 's race will also reap millions of dollars			1
