a trio of heavily armed state troopers looked down intently from a bridge in rural @entity3			1
behind them , a slow procession of unmarked cars climbed a steep hill to deliver the next tour of local , state and federal law enforcement agents in the nearly two - week hunt for cop - killing suspect @entity12			1
broken branches beneath the span caught the troopers ' attention			2
two officers , carrying rifles and wearing ballistic vests , descended to inspect			1
the third stood guard above			2
every disturbed branch merits a closer look for clues to the whereabouts of the self - styled survivalist with a grudge against law enforcement			1
@entity12 , 31 , is the suspect in a september 12 ambush that left cpl. @entity30 dead and another trooper wounded outside the @entity33 barracks in @entity34 , @entity3			1
on wednesday , with as many as 1,000 law enforcement officers involved in the manhunt at a given time , authorities revealed that the meticulous , grid - like search over up to 3 square miles of hilly terrain may be paying off			1
there have been a number of sightings of a man believed to be @entity12 -- a war buff obsessed with @entity48 military conflicts -- by both local residents and police , state police lt. col @entity41 said without giving further details			1
the last sighting came about 24 hours ago			0
the sightings were from a significant distance , however , and @entity12 has continued to elude authorities			1
the search has yielded an empty pack of @entity59 cigarettes , @entity41 said			0
@entity12 claims to have fought with @entity59 in @entity60 and has studied @entity62 and @entity59 languages , according to the @entity63 , which last week named him one of its @entity65 fugitives			1
soiled adult diapers were also found , perhaps used by @entity12 to stay in a stationary position for long periods of time			1
" i think this is a game to him in some ways , " @entity41 said			0
it 's a game that 's wearing thin on some residents of @entity76 and @entity77 counties who have been affected by the massive manhunt			1
local lawyer @entity80 is asking residents who feel that their rights have been violated during the police manhunt to contact his law firm			1
" i 've spoken with a number of individuals who have either been excluded from their homes , ordered to stay in their homes or have been subjected to searches of their vehicles all without warrants or court orders , " he said			1
" these are innocent third parties , " he added			0
" they have no relationship with mr. @entity12 , and the @entity33 and @entity63 appear to be merely doing whatever they want up there and ordering people to allow them to go through their homes and vehicles , all in violation of the @entity103			1
" in a statement tuesday night , the @entity33 , the lead agency in the investigation , said that " at no time " were residents completely restricted from access to their homes			1
" to clear up any misconceptions regarding the search , we have been diligent in respecting the rights of the public while working hard to keep both residents and law enforcement personnel safe			1
we need to be deliberate and methodical in our operations , as we still believe that @entity116 is armed and very dangerous , " the statement said			1
@entity41 thanked residents for their " patience and understanding " and said troopers were " doing their best to balance safety concerns			2
" over the weekend , authorities discovered an @entity125 rifle , some magazines and a small bag of ammo believed to belong to @entity12			1
@entity129 , who owns the @entity130 about 100 yards away , said many residents were inconvenienced but understood the work of law enforcement			2
" there is frustration , but i do n't think it 's due to the troopers or local responders doing their jobs , " he said			0
" it 's an inconvenience , obviously			0
... we 're frustrated because the search is still ongoing and we have a dangerous criminal in our backyard			0
... everybody that 's talking about being locked out or being locked down , they understand why it 's happening			0
but yes , they 're frustrated			0
" area schools opened tuesday for the first time since the middle of last week , although some school buses were kept off roads because of heavy police activity			2
there was increased security throughout the @entity159 , and students would remain indoors , according to the district 's website			0
" this is an extremely difficult situation for our community , " the website said			0
" schools will be in session but , ultimately it is your decision as parents whether to send your children to school			0
@entity174 will respect your decision and all absences will be excused and will not impact a student 's perfect attendance			0
" for the moment , the reopening of schools and roads tuesday provided a sense of relief vof a community under virtual lockdown			0
on wednesday , attendance in the 9,800 - student district was up to 84 % after dropping to 70 % the day before			2
after - school athletic practices were moved indoors and home athletic competitions canceled			2
" i talked to a mom or two that had n't sent their children to school but wanted to know how things were going , " district spokeswoman @entity191 said			0
" once i reassured them , they said they were considering sending their children to school			0
they 're concerned about the safety of the students			0
" @entity41 said an examination of @entity12 's notes and reading material as well as interviews with relatives and others reveal that he probably had planned the shootings for months , if not years			1
the distance and rugged terrain separating officers from the suspect during recent sightings meant " he has had the ability to disappear , " @entity41 said			2
@entity218 planned for months ? authorities have said that @entity12 hated law enforcement and that they believe that he 's solely focused on hurting more officers but not civilians			1
" we 're not going away , " @entity41 said			0
" we 'll be here until we apprehend him			0
" for residents , life in the @entity226 has changed			2
" we 're the country , but it does n't seem very country - ish right now , " @entity191 said			2
" it 's not the normal routine			0
