@entity0 -- the @entity3 @entity2 ruled monday that federal judges have the discretion to give " reasonably " shorter prison terms for crack - cocaine crimes to reduce the disparity with crimes involving cocaine powder			1
lawyers argue that crack - cocaine offenders were unfairly targeted			2
the 7 - 2 ruling represents a victory for lawyers who argued that crack - cocaine offenders were unfairly targeted under @entity3 sentencing guidelines			2
current federal penalties for selling 5 grams of crack cocaine can warrant the same prison sentence as dealing 500 grams of the powdered variety			1
the @entity2 case centered around @entity23 of @entity24 , @entity25 , who according to court records , pleaded guilty to distributing more than 50 grams of crack cocaine			1
federal sentencing guidelines called for 19 to 22.5 years behind bars			0
but judge @entity30 instead gave the defendant a 15 - year sentence , calling the case " another example of how crack - cocaine guidelines are driving the offense level to a point higher than is necessary to do justice			2
" a federal appeals court overturned the case and sent it to a higher court , saying @entity30 's discretion was " unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses			1
" @entity48 's attorney , @entity47 in october , " a sentence of 19 years for a man with no felony convictions who served his country honorably , who had never spent a night in jail ... that was ridiculous			0
" @entity23 is a veteran of the 1991 @entity57 and is african - american			0
african - americans were nearly 82 percent of defendants sentenced in federal court for dealing crack , but only 27 percent of those sentenced for dealing powder cocaine , according to 2006 federal statistics			1
each year , federal courts handle about 11,000 cocaine sentences , which are roughly evenly divided between crack and cocaine cases			2
the issue long has been a source of contention between government prosecutors and civil rights advocates , who argue crack dealers are often targeted for longer prison terms because that drug is prevalent in urban and minority communities , while the powdered version is more commonly associated with higher - income users			1
writing for the majority , justice @entity81 took a practical approach , saying it is important to preserve judicial discretion , while ensuring most sentences remain within federal guidelines established two decades ago to ensure a measure of uniformity			2
@entity81 said a federal judge was right to give a crack offender a lesser prison term than the guidelines called for , since federal law " mandates only maximum and minimum sentences , " she wrote			1
" it says nothing about appropriate sentences within those statutory guidelines			0
" @entity81 noted the trial judge " honed in on the particular circumstances of @entity23 's case and accorded weight to " reports by the @entity105 that show " the crack / powder disparity yields unjustifiably harsh sentences for crack offenders			1
" justices @entity111 and @entity113 dissented in the @entity23 case			1
@entity111 said it will now be up to courts " to assume the legislative role of devising a new sentencing scheme , " something @entity118 never intended			0
the government had no immediate reaction to the high court 's ruling			0
the @entity105 -- an independent federal agency that advises all three branches of government on sentences -- recently cut the gap in recommended prison time for crack - cocaine offenses			1
the guidelines took effect november 1 after @entity118 decided not to overturn the changes			0
the commission is scheduled to vote tuesday on whether to make those guidelines retroactive for prisoners convicted in the past of crack dealing			0
almost 20,000 inmates could be eligible for shorter sentences under the proposed changes			0
@entity118 recently has introduced at least four bills that would reduce the current disparity in cocaine sentences			2
one widely circulated proposal led by sens. @entity146 , @entity147 , and @entity148 , @entity149 , would revise the cocaine ratio downward to 20 - to - 1			0
that ratio is also supported by the @entity105			0
harsher sentences for crack offenses came after a social epidemic of crack cocaine began destroying many urban areas in the 1980s			1
" the crack - cocaine guidelines were put in place because crack was fueling crime waves across the country , in particular with respect to street violence , " said @entity157 , a former @entity3 attorney in @entity158 who comments on legal matters for @entity1			0
" and it is clear that crack cocaine and white powder cocaine had a very different impact in terms of not only the lives of the users but the impact on the community			1
" the case is @entity23 v. @entity3 ( 06 - 6330 )			0

new : justices @entity113 , @entity111 dissent
new : @entity81 writes , " law says nothing about appropriate sentences "
@entity2 : judges may impose shorter prison terms for crack cocaine
ruling aims to shrink disparity between powder cocaine and crack sentences
