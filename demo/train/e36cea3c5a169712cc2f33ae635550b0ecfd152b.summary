-- he came from @entity2 to leading @entity4 club @entity3 in a mega-bucks transfer touted as the new @entity6			1
a series of niggling injuries this season put paid to any hope of @entity11 living up to those high expectations , while the tax issues surrounding his complicated transfer from @entity16 cast a shadow over his new career in @entity19			1
but the @entity20 , who has managed just nine league goals for @entity3 since touching down in @entity23 , is quick to rule out any correlation -- as some have done -- between those off - field issues and his form in a " @entity3 " shirt this season			0
which will be a relief to @entity2 given how important @entity11 is to their team and its hopes of winning the @entity34 on home soil			1
" no , i do n't think [ it has affected my performances ]			2
i 'm used to leaving all those problems aside , i 'm very relaxed when it comes to that , " said @entity11 , who was talking to @entity0 at a @entity40 event			2
" it 's unpleasant when everyone is talking about things that are not true , but on the pitch it does n't get in the way			0
" true or not @entity11 's club is being investigated over tax fraud regarding the transfer -- which @entity3 was forced to confirm actually totaled 86.2 million euros rather than the 57.1 million euros first announced -- while @entity53 had to step down from his role as president as controversy over the deal intensified			1
@entity11 's former club @entity16 , meanwhile , is unhappy with how the transfer fee was divided up -- with a large chunk having been paid to a company controlled by the player 's father , @entity62 -- and has been seeking a bigger cut than the 17.1 million euros it originally received			1
earlier this year @entity16 president @entity66 reportedly criticized @entity11 's father calling the deal he did with @entity3 " unacceptable			1
" " i was very sad by the way that @entity16 handled this problem , " @entity11 , who has previously defended his father 's role in the deal , said			1
" we had n't done anything wrong			0
" the way that @entity16 handled this left me very sad , but what are you going to do ? i ca n't answer for them , but i can speak for myself and my dad and say that we were truly saddened by how they wanted to resolve this			1
" @entity16 was the club that molded @entity11 into the player he is today			1
making his debut in 2009 at the age of just 17 -- after coming through the youth ranks -- he helped lead the side to @entity91 @entity90 glory in 2011			0
" what i lived at @entity16 will stay with me for the rest of my life , they were wonderful years where i made history			2
i think that wo n't be erased , " he said			0
" i 'm sad with the board , i 'm sad with who was in presidency -- with those i am upset			0
with the club , the fans , the players ? no. " i have a lot of love for @entity16 , because it was a club where i was for 10 years , so my love will always be great			1
" like @entity11 , @entity3 have had an up and down season , losing the @entity4 @entity111 final to rivals @entity112 and crashing out of the @entity113 at the quarterfinal stage , while a @entity4 @entity116 title looks unlikely			2
@entity11 , though , insists he is enjoying life at the @entity118 , which brings with it the privilege of playing alongside one of the finest players in the world -- @entity6			2
" everything is going really well , i 'm very happy in this city , " he said			0
" [ @entity6 and @entity125 ] have n't played all the games together but i think that the affinity that we have , that we 've been creating , is very good			0
the relationship that we have , it 's been wonderful			0
" some people were saying we would n't get along , and that 's been shown as being the opposite			0
he 's a very relaxed guy , he 's someone that i admire a lot			0
" despite the difficulties he has faced at @entity3 , @entity11 still has the chance to achieve what could ultimately be his career 's crowning glory			2
in six weeks ' time , the 22 - year - old and his @entity2 teammates will step out onto the @entity144 field to open the @entity145 against @entity146			1
the world 's most successful footballing nation will be attempting to land the sport 's biggest prize in its own backyard for the first time , roared on by an expectant set of supporters			0
" it 's a dream that is about to happen and i hope that dream that i 've always had , also happens with winning the title , " said @entity11 , who led @entity2 to @entity156 glory in 2013 having been named player of the tournament in the process			1
" it 's a dream to put on the @entity2 shirt , even more so at a @entity34 in my own country			1
for me it 's a great satisfaction			0
" winning the @entity34 in front of its own supporters would help banish the memories of the nation 's darkest sporting hour -- letting slip a lead to allow @entity174 to become world champions in 1950 , the last time the tournament was held in @entity2			1
@entity11 , the national team 's poster boy , is well aware of the pressure being piled on the shoulders of him and his teammates , especially given that they won the @entity156 in front of their own supporters last year			1
but the @entity3 man , who has represented his country on 48 occasions , says he and the rest of the @entity2 squad are relishing this once - in - a - lifetime opportunity			2
" i think that the responsibility that i have at the national team , like my teammates also have -- each of us has their responsibility			0
one needs the help of the other and we are getting ready so that we can win the @entity34 , " he said			2
" so close to the @entity34 , every time you see a @entity20 flag or you see some action of the national team , you hear people talking about the @entity34			0
i can imagine myself lifting the trophy			0

@entity11 says his performances have not been affected by transfer saga
the 22 - year - old is saddened by how former club @entity16 has behaved
the @entity2 *international* is *targeting* a @entity34 win on home soil
