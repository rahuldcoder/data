-- in light of reports that linked the name " @entity4 " with the operation that took down @entity6 , @entity7 expressed disappointment thursday and pointed to the sacrifices they have made in the service			1
" to associate a @entity14 warrior with @entity6 is not an accurate reflection of history and it undermines the military service of native people , " said @entity11 , president of the @entity12			1
" it 's critical that military leaders and operational standards honor the service of those who protect our freedom			2
" initial press reports said that " @entity4 " was used in the raid to refer to @entity6 , but a senior administration official later told @entity0 that it was code for the act of capturing or killing @entity6 , not for the man himself			1
@entity11 said that according to his understanding , the most - wanted terrorist 's code name was " jackpot , " and the name of the operation was " @entity4			0
" @entity4 was an @entity38 leader in the late 1800s who is revered by many in the @entity41 as a hero , the @entity12 said			1
@entity4 , a descendant of the warrior , was sharply critical of the use of his great - grandfather 's name			0
" whether it was intended only to name the military operation to kill or capture @entity6 or to give @entity6 himself the code name @entity4 , either was an outrageous insult and mistake , " he said			1
to use the name is " such a subversion of history that it also defames a great human spirit and @entity59 leader , " he said			0
@entity60 , communications director of @entity12 , said that whatever the reason behind the use of the name " @entity4 " and the debate over it , the real conversation was being lost			0
that conversation , he said , is about the 24,000 @entity7 active members of the military			0
a disproportionately high number of @entity7 serve in the @entity69 military , he said			0
the group pointed out that 61 @entity7 and @entity72 natives have been killed serving in the armed forces in @entity74 and @entity75 , and 445 have been injured			2
" let 's be very clear about what is important here : the successful removal of @entity6 as a threat to the @entity69 honors the sacrifice these @entity14 warriors made for the @entity69 and their people , " said @entity11 , himself a veteran .			2
