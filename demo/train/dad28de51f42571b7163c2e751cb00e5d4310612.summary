@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 strolled through the religion section at @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity1 , on monday searching for a last - minute christmas gift			2
the @entity8 looks at the text through the lens of the environment			1
" i 'm looking for a book on [ the @entity16 ] @entity17 for my husband , " she said clutching a 15 percent off coupon and lamenting the limited selection			2

@entity3 said she and her husband already have five copies of the @entity8 in their home			1
consistently the best - selling book on the planet , publishers are constantly repackaging it to lure new audiences			0
@entity36 in october released the @entity8 , looking at the @entity8 through the lens of the environment			1
in an effort to keep it true to its eco-conscious motif , it was printed in the @entity41 on recycled paper with soy ink , and has a sustainable linen cover			1
" it is still printed on paper though , " conceded publisher @entity45 , who said a digital format would be greenest			1
@entity45 said publishers were hoping to capitalize on the growing trend in @entity51 circles of eco-theology and creation care			0
the @entity8 is filled with essays from across the theological spectrum as a companion to the text			1
former archbishop @entity58 wrote the forward while @entity60 , a popular progressive author and pastor , and @entity63 , the staunch conservative theologian , contributed essays			0
anytime the text mentions something about the environment , the letters are printed in green , similar to how some bibles print the words of @entity69 in red			1
in the @entity41 , where religion and politics have danced and intertwined into a sometimes unrecognizable amalgam , environmentalism has been viewed by many politically conservative evangelicals as a " liberal issue			0
" @entity77 is the author of " serve @entity78 , @entity79 " and for years he has been trying to convince churches that environmentalism and creation care are theologically sound			0
their attitude , he said , has changed rapidly in the past few years			0
" recently i went to @entity85 , the largest church in @entity86 , [ @entity87 , ] and the pastor introduced me and said , ' i used to be against this , but examined my heart and the @entity8 and came to the conclusion i was wrong			1
' " another @entity8 out in time for the holiday season is the @entity92			1
the glossy oversized magazine format could easily mingle on coffee tables with @entity95 and @entity96			1
it takes the text of the @entity99 from the good news translation and mixes it with editorial photos			2
pages following a verse from @entity45 's gospel referring to @entity116 -- " @entity78 said i will send my messenger ahead of you to open the way for you " -- are adorned with pictures of the rev. @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 to hammer home the point to a modern day audience			0
" the text is our heritage even if you 're not a believer			0
we are stuck with it			0
let 's know more about it , " said @entity122 , the @entity123 advertising executive who is behind the project			0
@entity122 said his motives were philanthropic			0
though not a practicing @entity51 , he said the more people who read the @entity8 , the more who will see what it is all about -- and that will generate more religious tolerance			1
@entity135 's first goal was to make the packaging like a glossy fashion magazine so it would be more accessible to a modern audience , making it , " something you can find in a hair salon , something you can find anywhere , " he said			2
the @entity92 debuted last year in @entity146 , @entity123			1
when bookstores would n't carry it , @entity135 brought it to friends who owned fashion boutiques and design stores and said it flew off their shelves			2
there have been a few tweaks to the @entity156 language version			0
" there were some pictures that were sexy here [ in @entity123 ] that we took out because i do n't want to make it more offensive than i have to			0
" @entity135 hopes to have an @entity164 version in stores in time for @entity166			0
