-- it was a monumental challenge , a logistical effort @entity3 had never faced before : simultaneously moving a small army of technicians to 13 international locations , transporting 15 tons of tools per repair kit , and installing newly designed equipment in the field , taking five days per airplane working around the clock in two 12 - hour shifts			1
the goal : get 50 new 787 @entity14 back in service as quickly as possible following a three - month grounding			1
@entity3 's pride had been stomped on by the first ever grounding of one of its airliners			1
pride and a commitment for customer service meant going all out for five disappointed , sometimes cantankerous customers			2
the task fell to @entity3 's @entity26 , or @entity27 , to complete a task unprecedented in its scale			1
elements have been revealed by @entity3 's chief 787 program engineer , @entity31 , in various press conferences			1
below is the inside story of the planning process , the first time @entity27 has granted an interview about its planning and implementation process			1
outlining how @entity27 reacted to the two now famous lithium - ion battery incidents is the head of @entity27 , @entity41 , senior vice president , and @entity43 , managing director of @entity45 ( @entity45 ) aircraft services			1
i spoke with them at the company 's @entity50 headquarters in @entity52 , @entity53			1
single ' meltdown ' to worldwide grounding the first incident involved @entity57 on the ground at @entity59 on january 7			1
there was a battery meltdown , a " propagation " of eight cells , followed by a fire , which was confined to the electronics bay where the battery was housed			1
@entity27 was already planning to repair the @entity57 787 when another battery incident occurred january 15 on an airborne @entity69 flight shortly after takeoff in @entity71			1
an emergency landing and evacuation followed			2
@entity74 revealed another propagation incident , but this time no fire			2
what began as a typical repair reaction by @entity27 to the @entity57 incident became an international crisis a day later on january 16 when the @entity81 grounded the six @entity83 - registered 787s operated by @entity84			2
regulatory authorities worldwide followed suit			2
@entity27 's @entity45 unit knew immediately after the @entity69 incident it would be facing a monumental task , driven by the sheer scope and scale of the impending logistics			1
" i would call this not a simple job , but a straightforward job , " @entity41 says			2
" @entity97 's ( @entity43 's ) team thought a lot about laying it out so we could get as efficient as possible			1
compared with ripping a landing gear off or part of a wing off or replacing a rear pressure bulkhead , i would call that very serious work			1
this is more the large - scale logistics of it all			0
" within days of the @entity69 event , @entity43 's @entity45 team realized they would need to construct a mockup of the 787 's electronic bay on the ground			1
they also would construct a mockup in a 787 on the flight line at @entity115 ( @entity53 ) , where planes were waiting delivery and where more were coming off the production line			1
this work began in parallel to the research , development and design that ultimately involved thousands of employees across the @entity127 and from battery experts outside the company			1
" it was n't serial , " @entity41 says			0
" during that process it was becoming pretty clear there would be a series of steps : changes to the battery , changes to the charger , changes to the vent tube , the enclosure			1
@entity97 's team started engaging about halfway through as certain details got more refined			1
there was more clarity and preciseness to the event			0
we started bringing in @entity97 's team early on so he could start formulating his plans and actions			1
" the worst thing would have been to wait for everything to be done and say , ' here , @entity150			0
' " multiple skill sets " within @entity27 we had enough personnel to do what we needed to do [ to install the fix ] , " says @entity43			1
" however , because of the way the teams were going to have to be built , there were some very specific skills that were needed			1
a good example would be engine run			0
within @entity45 we have two engine run folks but obviously we were going to need more , so we did reach across the enterprise			2
" we reached out to our @entity164 ( @entity165 ) counterparts			0
we reached out to our factory			0
we reached out to our avionics functional test guys and the @entity115 flight line people really helped			0
a vast majority of it came from the @entity115 flight line			0
they are as close to the same skill set as we would require			0
" @entity164 employees are military specialists but a large group worked on the difficult birthing of the 787 during the four - year program delay			2
" it 's not like we had to train them , " @entity43 says			2
" they had already been trained and they were current on a lot of their training			0
" engine run is starting up the engines for a short time in order to complete tests and take readings			0
it is also important when " waking up " an airplane that has n't been operational for some time -- such as the case of the @entity14 that had been grounded for several months			0
" we were treating @entity59 as a one - off event , " @entity43 says			0
" [ we ] were trying to understand the damage			0
as the other events began to unfold , then we stepped back and said we need to take what we are doing right now and figure out how we do that on an expanded level			0
" once the grounding occurred , then we said we need to take this to the next step , to build the mockups , we need to go out on the flight line and figure out how this is going to go			2
" " we immediately began working with the 787 program to understand where they were headed , what they were thinking and to go out on the flight line and to understand some of the scenarios			2
the engineers would say this is what we think it is going to look like , this is what we believe are the areas we 're going to affect			0
" @entity221 was a huge deal			0
i would say that within two weeks we began to assemble that [ mockup ] room			0
we also had a live mockup out on the flight line			0
" @entity3 designed a " robust " fix that includes separating battery cells , a new charging system , venting and a containment box			1
' tedious ' fix the fix itself is far from the most complex job @entity27 has done in the field			1
@entity3 has in the past changed pressure bulkheads , grafted an entire nose onto an airplane and repaired badly damaged aircraft in the field			1
it 's not unique to @entity3 : all aircraft manufacturers have to support their customers			1
@entity245 had to undertake difficult and lengthy aircraft repairs for the @entity247 involved in an engine explosion over @entity249 that badly damaged the wing , structures and components			2
@entity245 also had to replace the entire tail of an @entity254 damaged in a takeoff accident in @entity256			0
@entity43 said the installation of the fix was n't onerous , but tedious			1
" we were worried about the logistics			0
three hundred people around the world when you have 10 teams out , that 's a pretty large package for us to do			2
the traveling behind it , moving the equipment			0
we had to go out and purchase the equipment to get multiple units			2
" the parts easily go into a lower cargo hold but the tools and logistics to do the work are more suitable for a freighter , @entity43 says			1
the equipment weighs close to 28,000 - 30,000 lbs. " we have to take everything that we need with us , kitted by crew size			0
once we determined what a crew size would be , we matched that up with kit			0
hand tools , power tools			0
one kit would take up a good portion of a lower lobe on a 777			0
" " this was on such as large scale , this is probably the single largest thing we had to focus on , the logistics behind being able to accommodate the movement			0
we moved equipment sometimes several times to satisfy the customers			0
" @entity27 's 10 teams fanned out to @entity296 , @entity297 , @entity298 and the @entity83 while awaiting the @entity81 review of the design and fix			1
the first 787 returned to service within days			2
the last of the aircraft are expected to return to service next month			0
all @entity307 airlines to resume flights			1

exclusive interview with @entity3 unit that handled the @entity307 fix
@entity3 built mockups of 787 battery bay
work was tedious rather than onerous , @entity3 says
fix involved multiple parts of @entity3 's enterprise
