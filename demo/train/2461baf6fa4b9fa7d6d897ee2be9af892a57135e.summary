the director of a video showing a woman being catcalled on the streets of @entity5 has weighed in on the seeming racial disparity of the men featured			1
@entity8 , who posted the video on behalf of the anti-street - harassment group @entity11 ! , told @entity0 that those shown were just a small sample			1
" looking at this as being some type of sample that is completely balanced , i think , is never going to be accurate , " he said			2
" to do that , we would have had to shoot for days and days , and we did n't set out to make a long video			0
" @entity8 , who was inspired by the experiences of his girlfriend , tracked volunteer @entity22 as she walked through the city over the course of 10 hours			1
the video shows her being greeted by mostly black and @entity27 men with calls like " hey , baby , " " damn ! " and " what 's up , beautiful ? " some of the men even follow her			1
in a @entity34 article headlined " @entity35 , " writer @entity32 notes that " the one dude who turns around and says , ' @entity37 , ' is white , but the guys who do the most egregious things -- like the one who harangues her , ' somebody 's acknowledging you for being beautiful ! you should say thank you more , ' or the one who follows her down the street too closely for five whole minutes -- are not			0
" @entity8 said that during the 10 hours captured on video , there were 108 instances of street harassment , of which he had 30 to 40 scenes with good enough quality for him to consider			1
he whittled that down to 20 scenes in the one minute and 57 second video			0
it 's difficult to distinguish that about six of the men were white because the faces were blurred , @entity8 said			1
" we have 18 scenes where someone is visible and on camera , and two of the scenes ate up half of the run time " of the video , he said			0
" and yes , those two men were not white			0
" we knew this was n't going to be an accurate representation , " @entity8 added			1
" for example , there are no @entity72 men , but that does n't mean that @entity72 men do n't do this , too			0
" critics questioned the disparity on social media			0
one tweeted , " to demonize men of color as the only perpetrators of aggression towards women is patently false and irresponsible			1
" another person tweeted , " i just got an attitude from an older white male , i did n't say good morning			0
# catcalling since everyone wants to make this a race issue			0
" @entity32 points out that @entity8 , who heads the marketing company @entity94 and told @entity95 " i make viral videos for a living , " has been accused of not being inclusive before			1
in 2011 , a blogger wrote about the @entity98 lip dub video project , which @entity8 hosted			1
directed on the streets of the @entity102 city , it featured participants lip - syncing the words to @entity106 's " @entity105 " and according to the @entity107 was one of several community events @entity8 organized			1
but a blogger identified as " kswheeler " wrote that the result did n't exactly reflect the racial makeup of @entity98 at the time : 57 % white , 18.9 % black , 13 % @entity27 and 1.62 % @entity72			1
" otherwise , @entity98 looks like @entity115 , " the blogger wrote			0
" and the people look like they 've been reincarnated from those peppy family - style 1970s musical acts from @entity119 or @entity121 's @entity120			0
" @entity8 , 26 , said the @entity98 video had an open call for participation			1
as for his latest project , he said the focus on the race of the men has been a distraction and " very frustrating			2
" in no way was he trying to portray one race as being more apt to harass women in the streets , he said			2
" i simply wanted to capture street harassment in a very intimate , close - up way in the real world and have people talk about it , " @entity8 said			2
" i just wanted to lay it all bare			0
" thursday morning on @entity0 's " @entity140 , " @entity22 discussed her experience with the catcalls , noting that because she was carrying two microphones while @entity8 walked ahead of her with a backpack camera , " we had great audio			2
" as for the racial makeup of the men who attempt to interact with her , she said they were " men of all colors -- in my experience every day , men of all colors			2
it does n't matter what size , shape , color			0
