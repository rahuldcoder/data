-- the great irony of the government spying controversy is that even @entity4 's state - of - the - art spy agency could not keep secret the fact that it might be spying on our secrets			1
nobody 's secrets are safe			1
not spies , not corporations , and certainly not the rest of us regular people , with our clever little passwords , our privacy settings and our restricted friends ' lists			1
the danger is not just from government intelligence agents using sophisticated computer algorithms			2
our privacy is vulnerable on many fronts			1
a 29 - year - old technician can personally decide to reveal the existence of @entity26 , a surveillance program that @entity28 , the director of @entity29 , says has brought " among the most important and valuable foreign intelligence " the @entity4 has gathered and its release will cause " long - lasting and irreversible harm " to @entity4 security			1
when the government is the one doing the snooping , as @entity37 , the former @entity39 contractor accuses the @entity39 of doing , it raises unique issues			1
@entity4 was founded on ideals that emphasized restraining the power of government and empowering the individual			2
opinion : massive spying on @entity4 is outrageous if the government is indeed engaging in wholesale spying with practically no restrictions on what it can record and read -- something president @entity53 denies -- this is an affront to the constitution , and it demands action from @entity56			0
and the breach of government secrets demands attention as well			2
if we pull the thread on @entity37 's allegations we may just find details of our own lives unspooling			2
everything about us is online , waiting for a corporation or a hacker or a spy to reveal it			1
@entity37 claims that the @entity39 and the @entity70 have direct access to the servers of the biggest internet service providers in the world , as well as the biggest social media companies and the most popular search engines , mapping applications , and internet telephony firms			1
opinion : why we need government surveillance the companies all deny this			0
@entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , and @entity92 -- all say the government has no direct access			0
before we find out where the truth lies , we should pause to consider what exactly those companies ' servers contain , because that information exists , whether the government looks at it or not			0
it is detailed information about everyone who uses the @entity106			0
think about this : if the @entity39 could not safeguard its information , how do we expect anyone to do it ? what kind of information are we talking about ? let 's review , from those " privacy policies " we always approve without reading because the alternative has become too burdensome			1
yes , the companies provide enormously valuable products and -- in theory -- we have the option of not using them			0
@entity84 's servers store much more than your @entity122 e-mails			2
they contain the words you have looked up , the illnesses you have tried to learn about			0
it knows what high school sweetheart you 've tracked down , it knows what pictures you 've looked at online			2
it knows what phone calls you 've made on @entity133 , and it knows where you have been when you made searches , over which cell tower or @entity137			0
@entity87 admits that even after we delete material from our page , it is not permanently deleted from its servers unless we delete the entire account			0
opinion : @entity37 is a hero @entity145 , the executive chairman of @entity84 , famously said , " if you have something that you do n't want anyone to know , maybe you should n't be doing it in the first place			1
" but that dismissive attitude assumes that if you want privacy you must have done something wrong , which is patently incorrect			1
it disregards the idea that we have a right to not have parts of our lives exposed without our consent			0
some argue the loss of privacy is " the cost of admission " to our new world , and see no problem with that			1
but the problems will come			0
there will be misunderstandings , insinuations and accusations			0
we wo n't be there to explain why we looked something up			1
why we talked to a certain person			0
@entity177 will be lost , relationships damaged , lives destroyed			0
will these firms sell our information ? of course			0
will they give it to the government ? @entity84 's @entity145 said yes , " it is possible that the information could be made available to authorities			1
" the important part to remember is that what we do online , what we post , what we search , what we store , what we write , what we put into words or pictures , is not protected , not even if its corporate guardians promise they will keep it safe			2
if someone in @entity201 can decide to reveal government secrets , it means another government contractor at the @entity39 or the @entity204 or the @entity70 , or an employee at @entity84 or @entity85 or @entity87 , or a hacker in @entity207 or @entity208 , could get his or her hands on the digital threads of our lives and make them public for fun or for profit			1
in the old days of the @entity216 , people would go to places like @entity219 's @entity218 if they wanted a private conversation			2
there is no @entity218 online			2
we may need to revert to face - to - face meetings for assured privacy , but that is simply not practical in today 's world			1
the debate over @entity39 surveillance should extend to other areas of privacy			1
it 's time @entity106 companies stopped holding on to our information without much more explicit permission			2
much more should be discarded without discussion			0
but even if progress is made in this area , we must know that we have entered a new age of greatly diminished control over our personal information			0
the @entity39 is no doubt enduring what countless victims of hackings have experienced , frantically trying to fix and explain and prevent more damage from the unwanted exposure			1
the data hunter has fallen prey			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity250 .			0

@entity252 says it 's *noteworthy* that even the @entity39 could n't keep its secrets secret
passwords , privacy settings and restricted friends ' lists wo n't protect our secrets either , she says
@entity252 : everything about us is online , waiting for someone to reveal it
@entity145 is wrong to say you should n't do anything you do n't want world to know , she says
