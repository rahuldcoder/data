@entity0 , @entity1 the predicament @entity4 found himself in -- pulled from his home by masked men , a dud bomb strapped around him , and ordered to clean out the bank where he worked -- is the stuff of movies			1
but this whodunit began monday in a quiet cul - de - sac in @entity15 , @entity1			0
and two days later , police say they are still searching for the two men who forced their way into @entity4 's home and ordered him to carry out the heist			1
it was still dark , when @entity4 pulled into his driveway , he told police			1
as he tried to go inside , the men forced their way in with him			2
the men , who @entity4 said wore dark clothes , ski masks and goggles , tied the two of them up and affixed " explosives " to them , @entity4 told police			1
when the men spoke , their accents made them sound like they were n't from the area			2
the men gave @entity4 an order			1
he was to drive to the @entity39 , where he worked as chief financial officer , clean out the vault and return home with the cash , @entity4 told authorities			1
as he drove , @entity4 did n't call 911 , but instead another bank executive			2
the executive called 911 , the @entity46 reported			0
the credit union evacuated ; police rushed in , and @entity4 never made it inside			1
officers took no chances and had schools in two towns locked down			0
they also shut down a main highway for three hours			0
" it was a very scary day , " mayor @entity56 said			0
police called in a bomb squad to free @entity4 from the device , while he sat in his car			1
they said the object strapped to him was harmless , the @entity46 reported			2
@entity4 was led to an ambulance in handcuffs and was checked over at a hospital			2
when @entity4 told police his home had been invaded , they cordoned off the area around his house			1
but then his mother came walking out on her own			0
she had freed herself , she told police , who found no sign of explosives in the home , the @entity46 reported			1
@entity58 also said that the suspects in @entity4 's account drove a white 4 - door automobile			1
a neighbor told the @entity46 that he had seen a strange vehicle outside @entity4 's house on monday			1
but he declined to give more detail , as the @entity84 has asked him not to discuss the case			0
the plot surrounding @entity4 is reminiscent of that of pizza delivery man @entity88 in 2003			2
@entity88 walked into a bank with a jerry - rigged bomb around his neck , saying if the bank did n't hand over money , the people behind the scheme would detonate the bomb and kill him			0
@entity88 died , when the bomb exploded on live tv			0
but investigators later determined that @entity88 himself was in on the scheme			0
@entity88 ' family still insists he was an innocent victim			0
