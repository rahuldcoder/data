-- when talking to @entity2 , it wo n't be long before she mentions that special guy in her life : her 3 - year - old son , @entity5			1
the 49 - year - old single parent has been frank about putting her role as a mom ahead of her role as @entity2 , recently telling @entity10 that she would n't hesitate to " move to @entity13 " should her career begin to negatively impact @entity12			1
but for now , @entity2 is still ensconced in @entity14			1
the actress has been selective with taking new work after her @entity18 - winning turn in 2009 's " @entity19 , " but her decision to star in @entity22 's october space thriller " gravity " just might lead @entity2 into another busy awards season			1
@entity2 squashes @entity26 romance rumors in the film , she plays a medical engineer by the name of dr. @entity30 , who , accompanied by @entity26 's skilled astronaut @entity31 , embarks on her first shuttle mission			1
as you 've probably seen in the heart - stopping trailers , all goes well until the shuttle is destroyed , leaving @entity30 and @entity31 stranded in space			2
@entity2 was challenged with simulating the concept in a believable way and consulted an astronaut to make sure she nailed the role physically as well as emotionally			2
yet even with that preparation , shooting " gravity " was still " hard on a daily level , for many reasons , " @entity2 told @entity0			1
@entity48 : ' gravity ' wows , propelling @entity2 toward an @entity18 nomination " the nice thing was that no matter what was going on , i got to go home to the same little guy , or have him there , " she continued , speaking of her son			1
" they made it so that he could be there with me 24/7			0
they created ' louis - land ' on a sound stage in damp , cold weather ; they created @entity66			2
so i knew that he was ok , ( and ) he was happy			0
and so it was worth going in and struggling for those 12 hours , because there was someone not struggling , right over there			0
" working with @entity22 did fuel @entity2 's natural fascination with what else is out there in the universe , but as far as turning her on to the idea of space travel , that 's still a no - go			1
" actually going into space ... that 's not me			0
i 'm very happy right here , " she said , relenting that perhaps a payment -- in the neighborhood of $ 1 billion , let 's say -- could convince her to change her mind			0
@entity2 hails law limiting paparazzi : ' children should not be sold ' " if i was 80 years old and they said ' here 's a billion dollars to go , ' i would do it , or if i was 80 and my son was a thrill - seeker or an astronaut and asked me to go with him , then i 'd do it , " @entity2 said			1
" and i 'm assuming that i 'd perish			0
that 's why i 'm picking that 80			0
i 'm grown ; he 's good ; any resentments that we need to work out , then let 's go to space			0
" at this age , though , @entity12 is completely unaware that his mom is famous and probably wealthy enough to pull that off			1
" he has no idea ( that i 'm famous ) , " @entity2 said			1
" i 'm simply the mom who makes the lunch , drives to school , finds where the toys are , washes the clothes , and i 'm here to play			2
and that 's all i should be			0
he should have no idea what i do			0
it should have no importance			0
... he 's supposed to be a little person for as long as possible			2
and i hope i do n't impede that with by what i do			2
" @entity0 's @entity124 and @entity125 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 loves to talk about her son , louis
the actress said the 3 - year - old helped motivate her on long days
he had his own *playground* built on the set of her new movie , " gravity "
as of now , @entity12 does n't know how famous his mom is
