@entity0 -- pro-russian protesters who disarm and leave occupied buildings will not be prosecuted , @entity3 's acting president @entity2 said thursday			1
" in the case when people put down their weapons and free administrative buildings , we do n't need to approve laws about amnesty			0
we guarantee there will be no criminal prosecutions of people who put down their weapons and leave the buildings			0
and i am prepared to formalize it with a presidential decree , " @entity2 told parliament			0
he added that " the main problem is that the people who are holding the buildings in @entity23 and @entity24 are being used by the enemies of @entity3			2
" the announcement came a day after @entity3 acting interior minister @entity27 said the separatist protests in @entity3 's eastern region would be resolved within 48 hours -- either through negotiations or the use of force			1
the protests , which began sunday , have been centered in three eastern cities : @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity35			0
the @entity36 has accused @entity37 of fomenting the separatist unrest as a pretext for military intervention			2
speaking thursday in the @entity43 , @entity42 secretary general @entity41 also pointed the finger at @entity45 for " stirring up ethnic tensions in eastern @entity3 and provoking unrest			1
" and he cast doubt on @entity37 's assertion that the troops it has along @entity3 's eastern border are simply there for military exercises			1
" as i speak , some 40,000 @entity37 troops are massed along @entity3 's borders , " he said			1
" not training , but ready for combat			0
we have seen the satellite images , day after day			2
" the @entity36 also estimates there are up to 40,000 @entity37 troops near the border , based on classified and commercial satellite imagery			1
military hardware a series of satellite images released thursday by @entity42 appear to show large amounts of @entity37 military hardware , including armored vehicles , helicopters and surveillance aircraft , massed at different places near the @entity3 border			1
this is accompanied by the full range of " combat support " capabilities , such as medical facilities , fuel , food , spare parts , logistics and maintenance , @entity42 sources told @entity1			0
the @entity36 ambassador in @entity0 , @entity85 , also posted photos via @entity87 on wednesday to illustrate the @entity36 estimates of @entity37 's troop buildup			0
the images depict what is said to be a field outside the southern @entity37 city of @entity94 -- empty in october , but filled with troops and armored vehicles on april 2			2
a @entity36 official with direct knowledge of the matter told @entity1 those photos " are consistent " with classified imagery			0
@entity102 is sharing some information with the @entity3 , but not highly classified intelligence , the official said			0
@entity3 was aligned with @entity45 until a month ago , and it is believed that @entity3 's security services are still penetrated by the @entity37 , the official said			1
' nothing but propaganda ' @entity37 's @entity109 said wednesday that @entity3 and the @entity36 have " no reason for concern " about the presence of @entity37 forces , which it says are on military exercises			1
" @entity37 has repeatedly stated that it does not conduct unusual or unplanned activities which are militarily significant on its territory near the border with @entity3 , " the ministry said in a prepared statement			1
but @entity41 had stern words for @entity37 's leaders , accusing them of spreading misinformation to justify their behavior			2
" @entity37 is trying to justify its actions by accusing the @entity3 authorities of oppressing @entity37 speakers			2
and by accusing @entity42 of a @entity130 mentality , " he said			0
" this is nothing but propaganda			0
designed to subvert the @entity3 government , pervert the truth and divert attention from @entity37 's own illegal and illegitimate actions			1
" the @entity137 has strongly condemned @entity37 for annexing @entity3 's southeastern @entity139 region last month , after a referendum held while @entity142 forces controlled the @entity144 peninsula			1
it fears @entity37 president @entity145 may next seek to invade eastern @entity3 , where there are also many ethnic @entity37			1
@entity145 said thursday that @entity37 had not planned in advance to absorb @entity139 , according to @entity37 state news agency @entity148			2
" i made final decisions only after the mood of the people became clear , because we had not been preparing for such developments , " @entity145 is quoted as telling @entity37 social activists			2
asset freezes as the interim government works to realign the country with @entity159 , the state financial monitoring office announced asset freezes thursday against ousted president @entity161 and dozens of those close to him			0
bank accounts belonging to 67 representatives of the previous government have been blocked , the office said			0
the action comes as the office investigates the alleged laundering of money " obtained as the result of corruption , theft and appropriation of budget resources and property by the @entity3 ex-president and his family , as well as members of the previous government and people connected with it , " it said			0
it also concerns people accused of involvement in the deaths of protesters whose street demonstrations pushed @entity161 out of office , and of those accused of organizing separatist activity in @entity3 , the office said			0
gas prices the crackdown on alleged corruption comes as @entity3 's interim government seeks also to shore up its struggling economy			1
its dependence on @entity37 for supplies of natural gas is a key area of concern , especially in light of a hefty price hike last month that took the cost to nearly $ 500 per 1,000 cubic meters			0
@entity3 owes about $ 2.2 billion for natural gas bills to @entity205 , @entity37 's state - owned energy monopoly			1
@entity145 warned in an open letter thursday to 18 @entity159 leaders that @entity205 could demand advance payment or even shut off the gas supply to @entity3 if it does n't pay up , according to the state - run @entity212 news agency			1
" we fully realize that this ( move ) increases the risk of natural gas passing through @entity3 's territory being siphoned off as it heads to @entity159 consumers , " @entity145 is quoted as writing			1
" we also realize that this may make it difficult for @entity3 to accumulate sufficient gas reserves for use in the autumn and winter period			0
" @entity3 energy minister @entity227 told @entity1 earlier that @entity37 was using its energy dominance as a weapon			2
" @entity37 announced an unacceptable price for @entity3			2
there is no justification for this , and of course @entity3 can not accept that price , which is almost $ 500 for 1,000 cubic meters , " he said			0
" this is a political cost			0
it is an economic weapon which @entity37 is now using after they made a war in @entity139			0
" he said that @entity3 is ready to pay its debt but wants to pay it within the parameters of a 2013 agreement -- a deal that has since been torn up by @entity37			1
negotiations continue over the price , which @entity37 has increased by 81 % since @entity161 was ousted in february , but @entity45 has not accepted @entity3 's proposals , he said			1
@entity227 says @entity3 , which produces only limited amounts of gas itself , is not piping gas from @entity37 and has enough in reserve to last three months			1
but it needs a new deal either with @entity37 or @entity159 for gas before july , when it has to start stockpiling gas for essential winter heating , he said			1
@entity1 's @entity255 reported from @entity0 and @entity256 wrote and reported in @entity257			0
@entity1 's @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 contributed to this report .			0
