-- it 's not the most ambitious @entity2 in history , but maybe that 's the secret ingredient that 's making one man 's pitch on the crowd - funding website so successful			1
well , maybe that and a little dill			0
" basically i 'm just making potato salad			2
i have n't decided what kind yet , " wrote @entity12 on his campaign 's @entity2 page			1
in a campaign that went online over the holiday weekend , @entity12 's goal was to raise only $ 10			1
he tempered any expectations -- if there were any			0
" it might not be that good			0
it 's my first potato salad			1
" despite his own lukewarm forecast , potential investors were not shaken by @entity12 's recipe indecisiveness and lack of experience			1
by sunday evening , @entity12 had raised nearly $ 5,000 by 850 backers			1
" i never thought it would go this far , " @entity12 of @entity29 told a @entity31 " @entity30			0

" so what do investors -- which @entity2 calls " backers , " get in return ? a pledge of $ 1 -- of which there were more than 300 by sunday evening -- earns a " thank you " from @entity12 on the website as well as aloud while the potato salad is made			1
but for $ 20 , you get a potato - salad themed haiku written by @entity12 and a signed jar of mayonnaise			2
as the campaign caught steam over the holiday weekend , a new goal was set : at $ 3,000 the " whole @entity56 " would be invited to @entity29 to taste the potato salad			1
that did n't take long			0
" we 're going to need a lot of potato salad ! " he wrote when $ 3,000 came and went			2
" it could take me weeks to make it			0
" asked on @entity31 why he was doing it , @entity12 got philosophical			0
" @entity66 is n't controversial , but it seems to unite us all			0
