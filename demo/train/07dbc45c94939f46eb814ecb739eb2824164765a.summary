@entity0 -- a december 22 briefing , prepared by the top @entity4 intelligence official in @entity5 and obtained by @entity1 , maps out the strategy and strength of the @entity8 and their allies in @entity5 , and concludes that the @entity8 insurgency in @entity5 is increasingly effective			1
the briefing , which warns that the " situation is serious , " was prepared by maj. gen. @entity13 last month			2
his assessment is that the @entity8 's " organizational capabilities and operational reach are qualitatively and geographically expanding " and the group is capable of much greater frequency of attacks and varied locations of attacks			0
according to the unclassified briefing , the insurgency can now sustain itself indefinitely because of three factors : the increased availability of bomb - making technology and material ; the @entity8 's access to two major funding streams , one from the opium trade and the other from overseas donations from @entity34 countries , which reach the @entity8 by courier or through a system of informal banks known as " hawalas " that operate across much of the @entity34 world ; and the @entity8 's continuing ability to recruit foot soldiers based on the perception that they " retain the religious high - ground , " and factors such as poverty and tribal friction			2
a chart in @entity13 's briefing notes that security incidents -- which include improvised - explosive attacks , ambushes , mortar and missile assaults -- routinely hit 500 a week in the second half of 2009			1
that compares with a weekly average of no more than 40 five years ago			0
even in the generally slower winter fighting season , incidents have not fallen below 300 a week			0
the 23 - page briefing predicts that " security incidents [ are ] projected to be higher in 2010			1
" those incidents are already up by 300 percent since 2007 and by 60 percent since 2008 , according to the briefing			0
one section of the briefing is based on findings from the interrogations of captured insurgents			0
those insurgents said the @entity8 saw 2009 as the most successful year of the war , because violence had expanded and because the @entity5 presidential election on august 20 was marred by low turnout and fraud			1
detainees also told interrogators that the @entity8 see @entity74 as a handicap -- a view that is spreading as the @entity8 try to present themselves as a nationalist group seeking to liberate @entity5 from foreign forces			1
the @entity13 briefing also says , however , that @entity74 " provides facilitation , training and some funding " to the @entity8 and predicts that " perceived insurgent success will draw foreign fighters " into @entity5			1
a map of insurgent groups operating in @entity5 -- part of the briefing -- shows that an @entity90 militant group , the @entity89 , already has a presence in five provinces in northern and southern @entity5			2
the briefing also says the @entity8 maintain a " mutually supportive relationship " with @entity99 and central @entity101 fighters and will seek to " manage " their relationship with @entity74 so as not to alienate the @entity5 population , but still " encourage support from the global jihadi network			1
" among the @entity8 's motivations , according to interrogations of the captured insurgents : the @entity4 is seen as desiring a permanent presence in @entity5 ; promised infrastructure projects are either incomplete or ineffective ; the government of president @entity107 is seen as corrupt or ineffective ; and crime and corruption are pervasive amongst security forces			1
detainees also said @entity8 leaders strategically aim to portray their insurgency to @entity5 as fair and uncorrupted			1
part of that strategy is a " code of conduct " that @entity8 leaders published in mid-july 2009			2
it advises foot soldiers to " keep good relationships " with locals and warns them against mistreating civilians , forcing people to pay donations , searching homes , kidnapping people for money and using child soldiers			0
@entity5 in depth : @entity129 blog a @entity132 report released this month shows that the new @entity8 code has not translated into the insurgents killing fewer civilians			1
the @entity132 found that the @entity8 killed 1,630 civilians in 2009 , representing a 40 percent increase over the previous year			1
according to the @entity13 briefing , the @entity8 have largely re-created the command structure they had before the @entity4 invasion of @entity5 in fall 2001			1
the new structure consists of the " inner shura " ( inner council ) , an 18 - member group headed by @entity8 leader @entity146 that arrives at decisions based on consensus , but " within @entity146 's guidance			0
" those decisions are then communicated to regional shuras of up to 20 members , then to provincial shuras and the @entity8 's " shadow [ provincial ] governors			0
" the @entity13 briefing suggests that the @entity8 are effectively creating a parallel government , in competition with the @entity159 government			2
one measure of that , the briefing says : eleven provinces had a @entity8 shadow governor in 2005			2
the number was 33 by 2009			0
can @entity8 deliver justice better than @entity107 government ? the @entity8 's strategy in 2010 , as described by @entity13 , includes expanding into the north and west of @entity5 , where the @entity8 traditionally have had scant support ; continuing aggressive operations during winter , when warfare has traditionally eased in @entity5 ; and increasing @entity8 influence around the key cities of @entity159 and @entity176			1
the @entity8 's overall strategy is not to defeat international forces in @entity5 , but to " outlast international will to remain in @entity5			1
" that is to be achieved partly with more improvised - explosive attacks			0
improvised explosives caused 80 percent of @entity4 casualties last summer , according to senior @entity185 officers in @entity186 in southern @entity5			2
the explosives do for the @entity8 what surface - to - air missiles once did for the @entity5 mujahedeen fighting the @entity191 -- somewhat equalize the fight against a superpower , @entity13 says			2
the number of casualties from improvised - explosive attacks in @entity5 has risen from 326 in 2005 to 6,037 in 2009 , according to the briefing			2
the size of the insurgents ' explosives has dramatically increased , according to @entity13			0
in may 2008 , most weighed less than 25 pounds			0
as of december , more than three - quarters weighed more than 25 pounds			0
in the past , the report says , improvised explosives were made mainly from military ordnance , such as shells			0
they are increasingly made from homemade explosives			0
about 85 percent of improvised explosives in @entity5 are made with ammonium nitrate , a common fertilizer -- the same ingredient used in the 1995 @entity213 bombing			0
on friday , @entity107 banned the use , production , storage or sale of ammonium nitrate			0
the @entity13 briefing also outlined @entity8 weaknesses , including disagreements among local @entity8 leaders , the group 's dependence on marginalized ethnic @entity223 , and over-reliance on " external support , " an apparent reference to @entity8 havens in @entity220			0
the briefing concludes that the @entity4 and its allies have a key advantage -- the @entity8 have not yet reached the level of a popular movement			1
a senior @entity4 military official in @entity5 called @entity1 's account of the report accurate			1
the official also cited what he called " fundamental positive change " : significantly fewer civilian deaths caused by @entity4 and @entity243 forces , improved counter-insurgency efforts , and more effective partnering with @entity5 security forces .			1

" situation is serious , " warns intelligence briefing on @entity8 in @entity5
" security incidents " up to 500 per week in 2009 , from 40 per week five years earlier
detainees say @entity8 trying to *distance* themselves from @entity74 , the briefing says
