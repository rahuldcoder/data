-- the question has dipped in and out of the national conversation for decades : what should the @entity4 do about marijuana ? everyone has heard the arguments in the legalization debate about health and social problems , potential tax revenue , public safety concerns and alleviating an overburdened prison system -- but there is n't much new to say			1
the nation has moved from the abstract matter of " if " to the more tangible debate over " how , " said @entity19 , co-director of the @entity20 and co-author of " @entity22 : what everyone needs to @entity24			1
" changing attitudes about weed are part of a larger shift in the country 's collective thoughts on federal drug policy			1
just this week , on the heels of @entity0 's @entity35 reversal of his stance on medical marijuana , attorney general @entity32 announced an initiative to curb mandatory minimum drug sentences and a federal judge called @entity42 's stop - and - frisk policy unconstitutional			1
" between attorney general @entity32 's announcement , the decision made on stop - and - frisk and dr. @entity35 coming out with his documentary , it was a big week for drug policy , " @entity19 said			1
peruse the @entity50 website and you 'll see decrying pot prohibition is no longer confined to the convictions of @entity54			0
today 's debate involves an unlikely alliance that unites conservatives @entity57 and @entity59 with rapper @entity60 ( aka @entity60 ) , blogger @entity61 and @entity62 of " @entity63			2
" in june , the @entity64 cited organized crime , a national change in attitude , the efficacy of medical marijuana and exorbitant costs to local governments in its resolution supporting " states setting their own marijuana policies , " a stance similar to the one endorsed by the @entity76 and the @entity77			2
" i 'm surprised by the long - term increase in support for marijuana legalization in the last six or seven years			1
it does n't look like a blip , " said @entity83 , a @entity84 public policy professor with 30 years experience researching drug policy			1
@entity83 , who co-wrote the book " cannabis policy : moving beyond stalemate , " said he believes two factors are spurring the shift in national opinion : medical marijuana has reduced the stigma associated with the drug , making it " less devilish , " and the number of @entity4 who have tried the drug continues to rise			1
resistance fading when @entity103 and @entity104 legalized pot -- with strict controls by established state agencies and a coherent tax structure -- opponents were n't able to raise the money to fight the initiatives , which @entity83 considers an " important signal that the country is no longer willing to fight this battle			2
" as important as the lack of resistance , @entity83 said , is the subsequent response			0
though he does n't see federal legalization on the horizon , he noted that the @entity119 could easily shut @entity103 and @entity104 down , either via a @entity121 crackdown or an @entity123 prohibition on tax deductions for the purchase of marijuana , which @entity83 said would be a " killer for the industry			1
" instead , this week saw @entity32 make his mandatory minimum announcement without so much as a word about what 's happening in the states			0
likewise , @entity133 has been reticent , @entity83 said			0
" it may be that everyone 's waiting to see what happens , " he said			0
" i take their silence to be some form of assent			0
" in 1969 , a @entity142 poll showed 12 % of @entity4 supported pot legalization , and it estimated that same year that four in 100 @entity4 had taken a toke			1
last week , @entity142 reported that number had spiked to almost four in 10			2
@entity142 , @entity147 and @entity148 polls conducted in the past three years indicate a nation evenly divided , and @entity35 's documentary plants him among a loud chorus that has sung the drug 's praises since @entity154 approved medical marijuana in 1996			1
since then , 20 other states and the @entity157 have passed similar laws , while @entity104 and @entity103 have legalized it for recreational use -- a move @entity162 , @entity154 , @entity163 and @entity164 each twice rejected between 1972 and 2010 , according to the @entity165			0
sixteen states have decriminalized possession of personal amounts of marijuana since 1973 , including @entity104 , which approved decriminalization 37 years before voters legalized cannabis in 2012 , according to the @entity173			1
@entity174 , a @entity175 public policy professor who has been tapped to mold @entity103 's legal pot industry , noted that even in states where recent ballot initiatives were shot down , there are telling results			1
perennial red state @entity183 ' medical marijuana vote in november , for example , was a squeaker , failing 51 % to 49 %			2
" when 49 % of voters in @entity183 are voting for legal pot , we are n't in @entity189 anymore , " said @entity174 , who co-wrote " @entity22 " with @entity19			2
a savvier debate the tone of the debate is also a sign that the country is nearing a tipping point at which public opinion effects political change			1
rather than engaging in a simple yes - vs. - no debate about legalization , proponents are asking more nuanced questions : should " grows " be large or small ? what should the tax structure look like ? should potency be limited ? will the model involve for - profit companies ? how will weed be distributed ? " the discussion over time -- and i think it 's for the better -- the discussion is starting to focus more on the details , " @entity19 said			1
" before , nobody has ever really had to confront those decisions			0
... those decisions are really going to shape the cost and benefits of policy change			2
" president @entity220 's drug czar , @entity219 , said in 2010 that marijuana legalization was a " nonstarter , " an assertion the @entity224 says holds true today			1
the office emphasizes that the administration 's 2013 drug policy takes a new tack with the realization that @entity4 ca n't arrest its way out of its longtime drug epidemic			1
the @entity119 policy , announced in april , favors prevention over incarceration , science over dogma and diversion for nonviolent offenders , the office says			1
arguments for marijuana legalization , however , run counter to public health and safety concerns , the @entity224 says			1
the federal government may have a difficult time maintaining its stance , experts predict			0
@entity247 , a federal judge in @entity104 , said in december he sees marijuana following the same path as alcohol in the 1930s			2
toward the end of @entity253 , @entity247 explained , judges routinely dismissed violations or levied fines so trivial that prosecutors quit filing cases			0
" the law is simply going to die before it 's repealed			0
it will just go into disuse , " @entity247 said			0
" it 's a cultural force , and you simply can not legislate against a cultural force			0
" @entity174 , who is also @entity265 , a think tank applying public policy analysis techniques to the issues of crime and drug abuse , said the federal government may have tripped itself up in the 1970s by classifying marijuana as a @entity273 drug with no medicinal use and a high potential for abuse			1
if the government had made it @entity282 , the classification for cocaine and oxycodone , 43 years ago , it would be easier today to justify a recreational ban , he said			2
states to take lead @entity174 said the infrastructure he is helping establish in @entity103 could provide a model for other states , but ideally , he 'd prefer a model that involved federal legalization and permitted users to either grow their own marijuana or patronize co-ops			2
" all the stuff i want to do you ca n't do as long as it 's federally illegal , " @entity174 said			0
" by the time we get it legalized federally , there will be systems in place in each state , " which will make uniform controls at a national level tricky			0
the push for legalization has gained momentum , though , he said , and he does n't foresee it moving backward			2
in 10 years , proponents might even move politics at a national level , he said , though predictions are problematic so long as pot prohibition endures			2
" it 's sustained right now			0
whether it 's going to be sustained is another question , " he said			0
in the meantime , states are expected to continue to lead the charge			0
@entity162 could put a legalization ballot before voters next year , while @entity321 , @entity322 , @entity154 and @entity164 may give it a shot in 2016 , when the presidential election promises to bring younger voters to the polls			0
" i think a lot 's going to depend on how legalization plays out in @entity104 and @entity103 -- also , how the federal government responds , " @entity19 said			0
" we still have n't heard how they 're going to address commercial production facilities in those states			0
" the next @entity119 administration could easily reverse course , just as it could on mandatory minimums , @entity19 said , but while pot 's future is nebulous , the nation 's change in attitude -- not only since the 1960s , but even since a decade ago -- is clear			1
that makes proponents hopeful , if reluctant to make predictions			0
" i did n't see this ( shift in opinion ) coming , and i think that 's true of my collaborators , " @entity83 said			1
" so much for experts			0

in legalization debate , nation has moved from " if " to " how , " drug policy expert says
@entity119 calls legalization a " nonstarter ; " new policy favors prevention over incarceration
shift in opinion in last 6 - 7 years " does n't feel like a blip , " public policy professor says
poll says in 4 in 10 @entity4 have tried marijuana , up from 4 in 100 in 1969
