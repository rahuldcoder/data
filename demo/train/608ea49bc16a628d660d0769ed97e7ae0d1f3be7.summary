@entity0 -- as a 9/11 widow , i understood my role on the memorial jury to have both a personal and a public component			2
at no time was the confluence of those roles more clear to me than when we discussed the placement of victims ' names on the memorial			1
and nothing had a more profound effect on my feelings of closure than the decision to use the concept of " meaningful adjacencies " to determine the placement of those names			1
when i first heard the phrase " meaningful adjacencies , " i had no idea how powerful the concept would prove to be			1
at the time , in 2004 , those of us who had the honor of serving on the jury that selected the winning design for the @entity32 had been struggling hard with how best to display the names			1
it was clear that arranging the names alphabetically or by company would be too cold and dispassionate , as if this were a listing you 'd see in a building directory posted near the elevator			1
the alternative , displaying the names randomly , seemed at first to make more sense			2
after all , it was random , was n't it , who lived and who died on that terrible morning 10 years ago ? but ultimately , we realized , a random arrangement felt wrong , too			1
the deaths of our loved ones may have been random , but their lives were not			1
in the concept of meaningful adjacencies , we had at last found a powerful response to the senselessness of our loved ones ' deaths			1
placing names in thoughtful proximity to one another would give us the opportunity to bear witness to the shared care and concern , the labor and joy that bound these people together while they were alive -- whether as siblings or colleagues , as friends or family , or even as former strangers who turned to one another for comfort at that moment of cataclysm			0
in a profound way , we realized that meaningful adjacencies would convey both the disturbing appearance of randomness with a comforting underlying truth : we are all connected			1
the idea captured us all			0
@entity82 , the designer of the memorial , came up with this simple yet powerful concept			1
i will always remember how he explained it to the jury : a memorial is a monument unless it lists the names of those lost			1
it was crucial that the names on this memorial be displayed , and displayed with purpose			1
and so although it would be a herculean task to get the needed input from family members , we all felt strongly that the effort to evoke this underlying network of connections would elegantly and simply convey not only the way in which these precious lives were lost but , perhaps more importantly , how these precious lives were lived			2
it would be upon us , the family members , to decide who to list our loved ones near , and it would come from knowledge that only we could supply			0
when the @entity32 sent personalized letters to victims ' next of kin across the globe , there were more than 1,200 meaningful adjacency requests			0
all of them were honored			0
powerfully calling to mind the image of an invisible web linking those who perished , the reasons for some adjacencies will be fairly obvious to the general public			0
the @entity124 family — @entity126 , @entity127 , and their 2 - year - old daughter @entity125 , the youngest victim on september 11 — died together on @entity129 and will be listed together			2
their names might have been adjacent even in an alphabetical listing			2
but then there is a family that died on flight 77 — @entity137 and @entity138 , married for 17 years , and their children @entity141 and @entity142 — whose names would have been separated by a simple alphabetical order			2
and then there are adjacencies that express connections that are more hidden , and yet profound			0
@entity147 lost both her father , @entity148 , on @entity149 , which crashed into the @entity150 , and her best friend , @entity151 , who was working that morning in the @entity150 on the 96th floor			0
for @entity147 , the names of these two loved ones will forever be linked in her memory and now also at the memorial			1
it 's important to note that the memorial also launched a @entity159 , a digital tool to help family members and visitors locate any name			0
not only does the guide show the exact place where a person 's name will be , but it also provides background information on all of the victims and lists any adjacencies			0
people will be able to locate a name in advance via the @entity32 's website or use an on - site kiosk to find a loved one or learn more about any of the victims			0
in the case of my husband , @entity179 , i requested that he and his trusted colleague and friend , @entity182 , be listed near each other			1
although we will never know for certain , @entity186 's widow and i are convinced that our husbands died together			0
there is no more powerful testament to the special bonds that could not be broken by the murderous attacks of that day			0
we are comforted to know that their names will be kept close , reflecting how they stood together on the morning of september 11			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			2

@entity197 was one of the jurors who selected the memorial design
architect @entity82 had an idea for listing names by " meaningful adjacencies "
those who lived or died together are listed together if families wish
@entity179 : the deaths of our loved ones may have been random , but their lives were not .
