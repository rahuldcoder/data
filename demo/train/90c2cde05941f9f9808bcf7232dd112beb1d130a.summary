-- @entity2 mayor @entity1 now has a new fight on his hands : a tumor			1
the president of @entity7 announced wednesday that the embattled mayor -- just over two months removed from treatment for substance abuse -- has been admitted to the hospital , where doctors will try to get " a definitive diagnosis			1
" " it is being investigated further and we need to determine exactly what type of tumor it is , and then we can decide on what type of treatment is required , " said dr. @entity14 , the @entity2 hospital 's president			1
according to @entity14 , @entity23 has been " complaining of abdominal pains " for over three months that got worse over the last 24 hours			0
that prompted the mayor to go the hospital , where a ct scan revealed the tumor in his abdomen			1
it 's not known yet if the tumor is malignant , according to @entity14			2
@entity32 , the mayor 's brother and a @entity2 city councilor , asked reporters " just to give our family a day or so " as they learn more about the situation and determine what to do next -- including deciding whether or not @entity1 will continue his campaign for re-election			1
" @entity1 is in good spirits , and i just want to thank the well - wishers for all the calls that are coming in , " @entity32 said			1
the health ailment adds to the list of struggles facing @entity23 , whose fall from grace began in may 2013 with the release of a cell phone video that appeared to show him smoking crack cocaine			0
the @entity2 city council largely stripped him of his mayoral powers months later over those and other allegations of bad behavior			2
@entity23 did n't back down , though , instead vowing " outright war " on the city council			0
the mayor apologized for " a lot of stupid things , " including having used crack cocaine , but he refused to resign or enter rehab			0
in fact , despite all the criticism and his becoming a punchline for jokes in @entity69 as well as the @entity70 , @entity23 launched a bid for re-election			0
yet this past spring , after a local newspaper reported on a new video that allegedly shows him smoking crack cocaine , @entity23 relented on one front : by going into rehab			0
he returned to work in late june , after a two - month rehab stint , saying he was " ashamed , embarrassed and humiliated " by some of his past actions			0
but even then , he refused to resign or refrain from campaigning , saying to the voters of @entity2 , " i look forward to serving you for many , many more years			2
" ' ashamed , embarrassed ' @entity1 returns as @entity2 mayor after rehab			2

@entity2 hospital **executive** : a ct scan shows @entity1 has a tumor in his abdomen
it 's not known if the tumor is malignant or how it will be treated , the **executive** adds
@entity1 is " in good spirits , " his brother says
the mayor , who is running for re-election , has been *dogged* by his substance abuse
