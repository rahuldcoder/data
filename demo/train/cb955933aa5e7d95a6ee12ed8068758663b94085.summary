@entity0 -- in @entity4 , milk is used in holy ceremonies , it is offered to the gods , poured over deities and generally considered the healthiest of drinks			1
but a first - of - its - kind government survey reveals that a stunning 68.4 % of milk sold in @entity4 does not meet basic government standards			1
the @entity13 tested milk across the country			2
it took 1,791 samples -- and of of those , 1,226 were found to be " non-conforming			1
" in seven @entity4 states , 100 % of the samples failed to meet standards			1
some samples contained water and milk powders ; others included potentially toxic ingredients			1
" we found about 14 % of the samples which found traces of detergent , " said @entity28 , the chief executive officer of the food safety authority			1
in lesser percentages , the tests also found hydrogen peroxide and urea -- a substance found in fertilizer and urine			2
" there is a problem and they need to face it head - on and they have to kind of really take some strict action against those people who are violating simple consumer rights of getting a clean glass of milk , " said @entity40 , the food safety and toxins deputy program manager with the @entity41			2
doctors say ingested over long periods of time , chemicals like detergent can eat away the lining of intestines , stomach and affect the liver and the kidneys			2
just adding water to the milk can pose a real danger in @entity4 where waterborne illnesses are commonplace			1
" what you get is diarrhea			0
what we call gastroenteritis , " said dr. @entity69 , a senior consultant for internal medicine at @entity0 's @entity72 hospital said			0
" you can get something like cholera			0
there are infections like typhoid fever , which are all part of water - borne infections in this part of the world			0
" at a dairy on the outskirts of @entity4 's capital , a worker dilution is widely practiced -- but that his plant does not participate			2
" a lot of people do it			0
they add water and take the milk and sell it , " @entity95 said			2
" they add water because it increases the quantity of milk and there is more to sell			2
" the milk industry in @entity4 is a chaotic mix of producers and sellers			1
milk comes to the market in many different ways			0
it can be carried in on the heads of farmers in pails , put in containers which are strapped to a train or a bicycle , or delivered in a massive milk truck			0
in many places , including the capital , fresh milk is still delivered to homes			0
the sources also vary : from a family with three cows , to farms with more than 30 cows and buffaloes , to huge dairy plants			0
government authorities say 70 % of the milk on the market comes from small to medium farms that operate in , what is known , as the " unorganized sector			1
" in the government test , less than a third of the milk samples came from large producers			1
while @entity4 has strict regulations in place to ensure milk safety , consumer advocates say enforcement is so lax it 's laughable			1
" well it does reflect that there is a need to strengthen our implementation machinery , @entity28 said			0
" that need is definitely underlined by this study			0
" but , he said , his office has been granted new powers recently and it plans on more surveys			0
he expects there will be better enforcement in the coming weeks , months and years			0
food safety watchdog groups say milk dilution has been around for decades			1
they hope the milk survey will mean good news for consumers because -- for the first time -- the government itself has revealed the true scope of the problem and pledged to do something about it			1
@entity1 's @entity172 contributed to this report .			0
