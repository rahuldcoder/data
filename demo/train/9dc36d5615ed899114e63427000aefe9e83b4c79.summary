@entity0 , @entity1 -- the first batch of departing @entity5 soldiers left @entity1 this week , beginning a drawdown of 10,000 @entity5 troops scheduled to leave by year 's end			1
about 650 @entity5 soldiers left the northeastern province of @entity10 on wednesday , according to lt. commander @entity11 , a spokeswoman for the @entity13 - led @entity12			1
military officials say this is the first group of soldiers whose redeployment will not be replaced by a new rotation of fresh troops			1
another 600 troops are in the process of leaving , @entity11 said			1
both groups are from the @entity24			0
the remainder of a 33,000 @entity5 troop surge -- which began in 2009 -- are expected to return home by the end of 2012 , president @entity25 has said			1
the full draw - down is expected to take place by the end of 2014 , gradually transferring responsibilities to @entity1 government forces			2
about 150,000 @entity12 forces are currently in @entity1 , including nearly 100,000 from the @entity5 -- the largest @entity13 presence in the region since the @entity5 - led war began in 2001			1
but the costs of a near decade - long conflict may appeal less and less to a war - weary public , still reeling from the effects of a global recession			2
last month , nearly three - quarters of @entity5 polled said they support the @entity5 pulling out some or all of its forces from @entity1			1
friday 's news comes a day after gen. @entity48 -- the outgoing top commander of the @entity13 forces in @entity1 -- crossed into @entity50 with his successor , @entity52 lt. gen. @entity51 , to meet with top @entity50 military brass			0
the meeting -- @entity48 ' seventh trip to the neighboring country as @entity12 commander -- was part of an effort to " improve regional security , " according to a @entity13 statement			0
the @entity5 is currently holding back $ 800 million in aid to its longtime ally , after @entity50 decided to reduce the number of visas for @entity5 military trainers			1
relations between the two nuclear powers had soured after a @entity5 raid on former @entity72 leader @entity71 's compound in may			2
tensions have also been strained by @entity5 drone attacks in @entity50 's tribal areas that have sometimes resulted in civilian casualties			2
meanwhile , @entity48 ' exit and the troop draw - down comes amid a rash of recent violence across @entity1 , particularly in country 's restive southern and eastern provinces			0
on thursday , a suicide bomber slipped into a @entity86 mosque and killed at least six people , wounding 15 others , a hospital official said			0
the attack occurred as several high - ranking @entity1 officials had gathered to remember president @entity92 's half - brother , @entity91 , the @entity86 provincial council chief and a key powerbroker in the region , who was slain tuesday by a long - time bodyguard			0
news of the draw - down has since raised looming queries about the country 's future			0
while diminishing numbers of @entity13 forces are expected to transfer power to their @entity1 counterparts , skeptics question whether @entity1 's fledgling security apparatus can effectively repel a resurgent militancy without foreign intervention .			0
