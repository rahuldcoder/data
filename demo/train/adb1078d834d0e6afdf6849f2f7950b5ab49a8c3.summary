-- strategically located in the eastern @entity2 , @entity1 has stood at one of the geographical , cultural and economic fault - lines between @entity6 and @entity7 since ancient times			1
in mythology , it was the birthplace of the @entity13 goddess of love , @entity10 , however the island has seen plenty of conflict throughout its history			2
when the @entity17 divided in the 4th century , @entity1 came under the rule of the @entity19 , developing the @entity22 - @entity21 culture that remains the hallmark of @entity24 today			2
but for the next 1,500 years , @entity1 remained at the mercy of successive waves of foreign invaders			2
during the @entity29 - @entity19 wars between the 7th and 11th century , @entity1 was subject to everything from small piratical raids to full - scale assaults in which thousands were slaughtered			1
the cycle of invasion and foreign rule continued to the mid- 20th century as @entity1 fell variously to @entity36 during the @entity37 , the @entity38 under the @entity39 and the @entity40 in the 15th century			1

cyprus in the 20th century by the time @entity1 came under @entity53 administration in 1878 , @entity13 @entity1 were already agitating for union with @entity55			1

in july 1974 , the @entity13 military junta backed a coup d'etat in @entity1			1
in response @entity49 launched military intervention and by august it had landed thousands of troops and successfully partitioned the island along what is known as the " @entity84			1
" around 180,000 @entity24 were forced south and some 50,000 @entity57 moved into vacant properties in the northern @entity49 occupied zone			1
@entity1 has existed as a de-facto divided country ever since and the events of the bloody summer of 1974 still dominate , not just the politics of the island , but @entity93 - @entity49 relations in general			1
in 1983 , the administration in northern @entity1 declared the " @entity95 ( @entity95 ) " ; an entity that is not recognized internationally by any country other than @entity49			1
efforts to resolve the conflict have ended in failure			0
attempts at reconciliation in 2004 , the @entity103 , named after then @entity105 secretary general @entity104 , led to a referendum on reunification which was supported by @entity57 but rejected by the @entity13 side as being too heavily weighted in favor of the @entity49 side			0

@entity118 -- a pedestrianized shopping area -- became the sixth crossing point on the divided island			0

" in 2004 , @entity1 gained accession to the @entity129 which recognized its entry as a whole but suspended its legislation in the @entity49 north , saying that " these areas are outside of the customs and fiscal territory of the @entity129			1
but the @entity129 notes that this does not affect the personal rights of @entity57 as @entity129 citizens			0
" economic ups and downs erratic growth in the 1990s -- largely due to fluctuations in tourist arrivals that reflected the island 's political instability -- gave way to stronger growth			0
the @entity1 was first listed as an advanced economy by the @entity151 in 2001			0
according to the @entity151 , @entity1 are among the most prosperous people in in the @entity2 region with gdp per capita surpassing $ 26,000 in 2012			1

in the north , however , the economy struggles			0
according to the @entity175 , its gdp remains one quarter the size of the south and , with @entity49 its primary public and private investor , its per capita gdp is around half that of the south			0

in a major economic crisis , @entity1 banks exposed to local property companies , the @entity195 and hammered by a junk rating downgrade by international ratings agencies , @entity1 banks teetered on the verge of collapse			2
only a â ‚ ¬ 10 billion ( $ 13.7 billion ) @entity129 bailout package , which included those losses for depositors , averted a financial disaster that threatened to drag the @entity2 financial sector down with it			0
ironically for partitioned @entity1 , the solution from the @entity207 was to split the country 's second largest bank - the @entity209 - into two banks ; one " bad " which would be wound down over time and one " good " that would be absorbed by the @entity213			0
