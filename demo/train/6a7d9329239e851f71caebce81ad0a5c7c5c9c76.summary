-- by the time photographer @entity3 arrived in @entity4 early august , the @entity2 epidemic had spread like wildfire			1
contagion and death rates grew exponentially during those summer months of seasonal rainstorms while , strangely , an eerie calm prevailed in the capital city of @entity11 , he said			2
that 's when @entity3 , on assignment with @entity15 's @entity14 daily , trekked through the muddy roads of the @entity18 nation , straight into the eye of the storm : the village of @entity22 on @entity4 's porous border with @entity24 and @entity25 , an area cordoned off by presidential decree for its alarming rate of @entity2 cases			1
" @entity11 was quiet , " said @entity3 , adding that at the time , there was still a level of denial in the capital			1
" @entity22 is a place where you had to get a special permission to go there			2
... when i arrived , the situation was so tense at the local hospital ... doctors and nurses would not touch anybody , " he said			0
a bustling diamond hub in @entity18 , the trading town of @entity22 and its outlying villages by then seemed like an apocalyptic science fiction movie , said @entity3			1
panic was palpable in the streets , lined with health workers in white suits , wallpapering public spaces with alarming bright posters depicting figures vomiting blood , spraying bleach here and there and taking the temperature of anyone suspected of carrying the virus			0
this new body language in the age of @entity2 is unnatural in such a tactile culture , where mourners embrace corpses and people are often seen holding hands			1
" in the streets , you do n't shake hands , you just say hello from afar , " said @entity3			1
" usually people talk about 1 meter away from each other because they are afraid			2
" but the real horrors , said @entity3 , he witnessed in the makeshift hospitals in the outskirts of @entity22 where people suspected of having @entity2 were put together in forced quarantine with little food or no access to family members			1
the state - enforced isolation , however , did n't stop family members from visiting these wards , said @entity3			1
daring fate , sisters , cousins , uncles traveled through the thick forest in order to bring food to family members infected with @entity2 , several times a day			1
" i tried to take a different point of view about @entity2 : not only the cemetery , not only guys with white clothes but the people , but life as it is			1
i took a picture of two women walking close to each other talking but they do n't touch each other			0
" @entity3 , who was only allowed to shoot from a distance of a meter or more , said he did not sense there was a great fear of contagion from locals in and near @entity22 , at least the kind of hysteria he 'd seen in developing nations			1
a very physically expressive culture , he said , people from the area found it hard to repress their desire to touch a loved one , heal a family member , kiss a child , frustrating many health officials			0
" but it is in the culture of the local people			0
they touch all the time , " said @entity3			1
" and in even smaller villages people follow old traditions			0
they are not afraid of @entity2 because they do n't believe it too much , " he said			1
" there is a much bigger relationship between each other in a smaller village			0
and if someone has @entity2 , they are in denial			1
they say : ' maybe this is malaria			0
' " the way a nation copes with a monumental crisis such as @entity2 is revealing , said @entity3			1
there is a lot to learn from their grief			0
" they are fatalists , " said @entity3			2
" they continue to live the same kind of life			0
they wo n't change anything			0
they are not so afraid			0
they say we need help , but they continue to go on as it was before , " he said			0
" one man said he was sick with @entity139 and called a man with a taxi , " said @entity3			2
" this man drove the sick one without any care or precaution and took him to another village			0
so both of them died of @entity2 , " he said			2
the avalanche of tragic stories are followed by moments of tenderness			0
a priest who closed the eyes of a man infected by @entity2 only to die a few days later			2
mourners who insist on kissing the body of their deceased loved ones			0
many who refuse orders not to perform important rites of passage in order not to contract @entity2			2
" this is all normal to them , " said @entity3			2
considering that in @entity4 more people die from @entity139 than @entity2 , " it is normal for a mother to know that if her child reaches the age of 5 , she is very lucky			1
because many many children die when they are 2 or 3 years old , " he said			0
@entity3 is an @entity15 photographer			1
you can follow him on @entity194 .			0
