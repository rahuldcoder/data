-- diners at @entity3 and @entity4 restaurants in @entity5 and @entity6 caught an intestinal illness after eating salad mix that came from @entity9 , according to the @entity10			1
the federal agency said its investigators have traced the outbreak to four " illness clusters " of restaurants , which spokeswoman @entity16 later identified to @entity0 as @entity3 and @entity4 locations			1
the probe did n't find indications that any bags of salad mix with the rare type of parasite -- known as cyclospora -- were sold at @entity26 grocery stores			0
the tainted salad mix came from @entity9 , " a processor of foodservice salads , " according to the @entity10			2
@entity30 -- the parent company for @entity4 , @entity3 and other restaurant chains such as @entity33 -- described the august 2 announcement from the @entity10 as " new information			1
" " nothing we have seen prior to this announcement gave us any reason to be concerned about the products we 've received from this supplier , " @entity30 said in a statement , in which the company insisted " it is completely safe to eat in our restaurants			0
" @entity46 has been cooperating with @entity26 officials , the @entity10 said , adding that tests will be conducted at the company 's processing facility in @entity9 " to try to learn the probable cause of the outbreak and identify preventive controls			1
" the last inspection there , in 2011 , turned no notable problems , according to the federal agency			0
the company 's ceo , @entity58 , told @entity0 on friday night that the company 's plant in @entity9 produced and distributed about 48 million servings of salads to thousands of restaurants in the @entity65 and eastern @entity26 this past june			2
" we have an extensive testing program in @entity9 to test water sources and raw product for coliforms , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 , " said @entity58			0

@entity5 health authorities said thursday that the prepackaged salad mix of iceberg and romaine lettuce , carrots and red cabbage was no longer in the state 's supply chain			2
" bagged salads and all other vegetables are safe to eat , " the state 's health department said			0
what 's happening in that state and @entity6 may be linked to 140 cyclospora cases in @entity101 , that state 's department of health services said friday			1
as of then , authorities had not singled out a common source for the @entity101 's outbreak , which is largely centered in and around @entity105 and @entity106			0
despite the lack of a connection , a @entity105 woman sued @entity30 on friday -- soon after the @entity10 implicated the restaurant company -- " for all general , special , incidental and consequential damages " tied to her july 1 visit to an @entity4 in @entity113 , @entity101			1
@entity114 contends in her lawsuit that four days after eating spaghetti with meat sauce and a salad from @entity4 , she suffered severe intestinal issues			1

@entity114 says she 's still not feeling completely recovered			0
" i think i 'm getting better , but i still do n't have a lot of energy			0
i 'm worn out , " she told @entity0			0
while he had n't been aware of the lawsuit until being alerted by @entity0 , @entity30 spokesman @entity126 said that his group 's restaurants in @entity101 have a different supplier than its restaurants in @entity5 and @entity6			1
the @entity26 @entity132 has been collaborating with health officials in numerous states since late june trying to pin down what 's causing the spate of cyclospora			2
