-- it was billed as a bright new beginning			0
but in the end @entity4 's opening day fixture of the @entity6 season bore all the hallmarks of its recent troubled past as @entity10 upset @entity12 's side to win 2 - 1 at @entity13 saturday			1
goals from @entity15 and @entity16 either side of a spectacular @entity19 overhead kick ensured the @entity20 were full value for the three points			1
apart from a @entity19 free - kick that cracked the post midway through the second half , @entity4 rarely threatened or looked like a side capable of getting its league campaign off to a winning start			1
" it is very disappointing that we have lost our first home match , " @entity12 told @entity29 in his post game interview			0
" we did n't reach the level we can play at			0
that is disappointing because we have done it much better and when you can not do it in your first home match that is disappointing , especially for the fans			0
" the feelgood factor had seemed to have returned to @entity4 since @entity12 's appointment earlier in the summer			1
a busy pre-season witnessed promising victories over @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			0
but saturday 's performance had more in common with last year 's disastrous campaign under @entity52 which saw the @entity53 finish seventh , their lowest placing in @entity6 history			1
" we were very nervous in first half , made the wrong choices and that is a pity			0
in the second half we never played as a team , therefore i 'm responsible , " @entity12 continued			0
" we had more chances than @entity10 but that shall say nothing about the result			2
it is the goals that count			2
" i thought we would win ( when the scores were tied at 1 - 1 in the second half ) but because we are not playing as a team in the second half we made the wrong decisions going forward			1
" @entity12 intimated later in an interview with @entity72 that there would be further signings arriving at @entity13 before the transfer window slams shut at the end of august			0
judging by this performance , the prospective new arrivals ca n't arrive soon enough			0
@entity4 began with a 3 - 5 - 2 system similar to that employed by @entity12 's @entity82 side at the @entity83 earlier this summer before switching to a 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 as the game progressed			1
there were competitive debuts to new $ 48 million midfield signing @entity87 and 20 - year - old center half @entity89			2
newly installed captain @entity19 led the line alongside @entity92 with @entity93 still missing after he was given extended holiday to recover from his @entity83 exertions			2
like many a visitor to @entity13 , @entity10 sat in deep and attempted to play on the break			2
it was a tactic that would work to perfection as @entity4 pressed and dominated possession but produced few goal - scoring opportunities			1
@entity15 was a standout in midfield for @entity10 while @entity103 was his usual commanding self at the back , organizing when required and reading the game exceptionally well			1
" we have been working hard in pre-season on defensive shape and we can get even better at that but there were pleasing signs in the way we stuck together and the goals we scored against a side of @entity4 's resources , " said @entity10 manager @entity106			1
" we have worked on the mentality side of things so that even when things go against us we continue to believe in what we are doing			0
" having lost a raft of key players over the summer , including @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 , many observers had questioned whether @entity10 would be relegation candidates			2
with more solid , mature performances like this over the coming season such predictions will be made to look badly placed .			0

@entity4 suffer 2 - 1 defeat to @entity10 on @entity6 opening day
goals from @entity15 and @entity16 ensure victory for @entity20
@entity19 scores overhead kick but @entity4 fail to *inspire*
