-- @entity3 ski resort gondola cars that were left dangling and swaying with terrified skiers inside failed because ice buildup snapped a supporting tower , the resort said thursday			1
one gondola car is suspended above an icy creek at a ski resort near @entity10 , @entity11			1
in a rare occurrence called ice - jacking , water seeped into the lower section of the lift tower and turned to ice tuesday at @entity19 resort , 177 kilometers ( 110 miles ) north of @entity20 , a resort official said in a press release thursday			1
the lift hangs from a tower that is spliced into two parts			1
extremely cold temperatures caused the ice buildup that exerted 800 tons of pressure between the two parts that hold the tower together , causing them to rupture , according to @entity19			1
the section of the lift affected by the accident had 15 cars going up the mountain and 15 coming down at the time , but they were n't carrying a lot of passengers , according to @entity39 , senior vice president of the resort			1
he said 53 passengers had been rescued from the stranded cars			2
no skiers at the @entity10 , @entity11 , resort were seriously injured			1
" the towers are not normally designed to allow for any water penetration and so this failure is a very unusual situation , " said @entity46 , senior vice president of @entity47 , the engineering firm that investigated the accident			0
they are trying to figure out what caused the water to pool			2
he said independent structural engineers are examining the tower from @entity20 - based @entity60			2
" the evidence so far indicates a sudden rupture rather than a fatigue failure over an extended period , " @entity61 said			0
at least two gondola cars broke away and hit the ground , both from relatively low heights near the tower that split , and caused the system 's heavy cable line to slacken , according to @entity72 , a reporter for @entity74 affiliate @entity73 in @entity20			1
" one hit a bus stop and the other hit a house , " @entity72 said wednesday			0
" another one was suspended over a creek , but everyone is out of that car			0
" the broken @entity83 was not operating thursday			0
@entity10 engineers checked eight similar towers across the two mountains of the resort			1
all passed those inspections , and are open thursday , the release said			0
the @entity90 says it does not expect to rescind operating permits on any lifts at the resort , other than the @entity83			0
@entity94 , general manager of @entity95 in @entity96 , @entity97 , said a lift tower at his resort was similarly damaged by ice in december 2006			1
the damage was discovered in the morning before the slopes opened , so no one was endangered , he said			0
the damaged tower was replaced in about three weeks , @entity94 said , and the resort 's business was not significantly disrupted			2
" we check our towers in the summer now , and we also check before we open up for ski season as well just to make sure they do n't have any water in them , and we 've worked with the manufacturers , " he said			2
holes have been drilled in the bases of towers so that water can drain out , @entity94 said			0
@entity0 's @entity118 and @entity119 contributed to this report .			0
