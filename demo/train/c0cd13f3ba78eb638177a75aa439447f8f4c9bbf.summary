@entity0 -- attorney general @entity2 stepped up his call for the passage of federal hate crimes legislation thursday , arguing that the federal government needs to take a stronger stand against criminal activity fueled by bias and bigotry			1
attorney general @entity2 has been a vocal proponent for tougher laws regarding hate crimes			1
he also sought to assure opponents that such a bill would not allow @entity16 clergy to be prosecuted for outspoken opposition to homosexuality			0
@entity2 made his remarks during testimony before the @entity21 , which is currently considering the @entity22			1
the bill would allow the @entity24 to provide assistance to state and local authorities in the prosecution of hate crimes while also expanding federal protection against hate crimes to cover disability , gender and sexual orientation			1
" hate crimes victimize not only individuals but entire communities , " @entity2 said			1
" perpetrators of hate crimes seek to deny the humanity that we all share , regardless of the color of our skin , the @entity43 to whom we pray or the person who we choose to love			1
... , " he said			0
" the time is now to provide justice to victims of bias - motivated violence and to redouble our efforts to protect our communities from violence based on bigotry and prejudice			0
" the attorney general argued that recent numbers " suggest that hate crimes against certain groups are on the rise , such as individuals of @entity63 national origin			1
" specifically , he said , more than 77,000 hate crime incidents were reported by the @entity66 between 1998 and 2007 , or " nearly one hate crime for every hour of every day over the span of a decade			2
" in light of such statistics , he said , it was one of his " highest personal priorities ... is to do everything i can to ensure this critical legislation finally becomes law			0
" republicans on the @entity21 disputed @entity2 's assertion that there has been a noticeable increase in the number of hate crimes			1
they also questioned the need for federal involvement in the prosecution of violent acts -- traditionally a function of state and local governments			0
they pointed to @entity66 figures showing a slight decline from 7,755 hate crimes reported in 1998 to 7,624 in 2007 , the most recently compiled statistics			2
it is " important to know ( if ) we have a problem of significant numbers of ( hate crime ) cases ... not being prosecuted in state and local governments , " said @entity103 sen. @entity102 , the ranking @entity104 on the committee			0
" murders occur all over @entity107 every day			0
robberies , assaults , rapes , burglaries occur every day , and those are handled by our state and local jurisdictions			0
... they do a pretty good job			0
" when pressed , @entity2 acknowledged he had no hard evidence of trends showing the problem getting worse , nor that states are not prosecuting cases based on their own state hate crimes statutes			1
the attorney general insisted , however , that the issue should be viewed more broadly			0
" it seems to me this is a question of conscience , " @entity2 argued			2
he emphasized that the bill is designed to give special protections to groups that historically have been victims solely based on who they are			0
@entity2 added that while state and local governments generally do a good job prosecuting violent crimes , there is nevertheless a need for the federal government to serve as a " backstop " on occasion , particularly if localities lack the resources for an effective investigation or prosecution			2
" there are instances where the ( federal ) government needs to come in , " he said			0
he also asserted that any federal hate crimes law would be used only to prosecute violent acts based on bias , as opposed to the prosecution of speech based on controversial racial or religious beliefs			1
" it is the person who commits the actual act of violence , who would be subject to this legislation , not the person who is simply expressing an opinion , " @entity2 said			2
several religious groups have expressed concern that a hate crimes law could be used to criminalize speech relating to subjects such as abortion or homosexuality			1
the attorney general has been a vocal proponent of federal hate crimes legislation since his tenure in the @entity171			1
last week , in a speech on civil rights , he cited three recent fatal shootings in calling for stricter hate crimes laws			1
" the violence in @entity0 , @entity177 and @entity178 reminds us of the potential threat posed by violent extremists and the tragedy that ensues when reasoned discourse is replaced by armed confrontation , " he said			0
@entity2 was referring to the shooting death of a security guard at the @entity188 in @entity0 , allegedly by a self - avowed white supremacist ; the shooting of two @entity107 soldiers in @entity177 , @entity192 , allegedly by a man prosecutors say was targeting the @entity107 military for its treatment of @entity196 ; and the slaying of a doctor who ran a women 's clinic in @entity178 , @entity200 , allegedly by an abortion opponent			2
@entity1 's @entity202 contributed to this report			0
