the " @entity2 " protests have ended , the prosecutor did n't step aside and the world awaits word from a grand jury determining whether charges should be brought against a white police officer who fatally shot unarmed @entity10 - @entity9 teenager @entity8 in @entity11 , @entity12			1
protesters demanded criminal charges against officer @entity15 , who some witnesses said shot and killed @entity8 while he was surrendering with his hands up			0
but police said @entity15 shot @entity8 after the 18 - year - old attacked him and tried to take his service gun in august			0
demonstrators also sought for @entity25 prosecuting attorney @entity24 to recuse himself from overseeing the case because , they allege , he ca n't be impartial after his police officer father was killed on the job by a black man in 1964			0
but he said he will not try the case if there is an indictment			0
meanwhile , two assistant prosecuting attorneys have been assigned to the case			0
here are key five things you 'll want to know as the legal system moves forward : 1			0
what kinds of charges are the grand jury considering ? it 's not just one potential crime			1
the grand jury is deciding whether @entity15 should be charged with any one of several possible crimes , including : first - degree murder , second - degree murder , voluntary manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter , said @entity48 , spokesman for the prosecuting attorney 's office			1
the grand jury can issue an indictment on any of those four charges , and it also has the option of adding a charge of armed criminal action , authorities said			1
at the same time , the grand jury will receive the @entity12 statutes for self - defense and the police use of deadly force			1
how many votes are needed on a grand jury to issue an indictment ? there are 12 members on the @entity12 grand jury ( some other states have different numbers ) , and nine of the 12 must vote yes to indict someone			1
the grand jury proceedings are conducted in secret			1
the same goes for the grand jurors ' race or ethnicity			1
does the grand jury have a deadline ? yes , the grand jury has until january 7 to make its decision			1
but the prosecutor 's office says there could be a decision by mid-november			2
how often does it meet ? normally a grand jury in @entity25 meets every wednesday			2
but the grand jury has been extended for the @entity8 case so jurors have extra time to hear from a number of witnesses and to focus solely on this case			1
in this scenario , the panel is allowed to meet on days when all 12 jurors can get together			0
once agreed upon , the schedule is given to the prosecuting attorney 's office			0
has the grand jury received all the evidence yet ? no , according to the prosecutor 's office			2
they have not heard from all the witnesses			0
some witnesses are still reluctant to cooperate , the prosecutor 's office said			0
ultimately , witnesses can be compelled to appear to the grand jury by subpoena			2
in past statements , @entity24 has promised a fair and thorough investigation			0
" we will be presenting absolutely everything to this grand jury			2
every statement that a witness made , every witness , every photograph , every piece of physical evidence			0
absolutely nothing will be left out so the grand jury is making their decision based upon absolutely everything and we 'll go from there , " @entity24 told @entity124 in august .			1

the grand jury in @entity12 is looking at several potential crimes , not just one
the grand jury has been given *permission* to set its own schedule
grand jurors have until january to make a decision
