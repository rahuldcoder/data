@entity0 , @entity1 -- police in the northern @entity1 province of @entity0 are looking for a man they say strangled his wife after she bore him a third child that was not a son			1
@entity11 , 29 , married his 22 - year - old wife , @entity12 , four years ago , police said			1
the couple had three daughters , the last of whom was born three months ago , said @entity16 district police chief @entity15			0
after the youngest daughter was born , @entity11 blamed his wife for not being able to deliver a boy , @entity15 said			2
" finally on saturday , the man , with the help of his mother , first beat the woman and then strangled her to death , " the police chief said			2
@entity16 is about 50 kilometers ( 31 miles ) from @entity0 city			0
police arrested the mother , @entity28 , and detained her at the @entity0 city jail			2
in a jailhouse interview , @entity28 said her son 's wife committed suicide out of guilt			1
" my son did not commit the crime , " @entity28 said			0
" ... but after three daughters , @entity38 herself felt guilty and committed suicide			1
" the report comes weeks after @entity1 police said they rescued a 15 - year - old girl who was locked up in the basement of her in - laws ' house , starved , and had her nails pulled out			1
the girl , @entity48 , was married off to a 30 - year - old man last year			1
authorities in northern @entity51 said the girl reportedly was tortured after she refused to submit to prostitution			0
activists say women continue to suffer in parts of @entity1 despite overall progress since the fall of the @entity59			2
in the second quarter of last year , the @entity60 ( @entity60 ) registered 1,026 cases of violence against women			0
in 2010 , it recorded 2,700 cases			0
in december , gunmen attacked and sprayed an @entity1 family with acid in their home after the father rejected a man 's bid to marry his teenage daughter			2
in another case , a 21 - year - old , identified only as @entity75 for her own protection , was sentenced to 12 years in prison after she reported that her cousin 's husband had raped her			1
her plight attracted international attention when it came out that she had agreed to marry her attacker to gain her freedom and legitimize a daughter conceived in the attack			0
she was eventually freed , following president @entity87 's intervention			0
@entity88 , a @entity89 - based @entity1 researcher for the rights group @entity90 , said the abuse inflicted on @entity92 is not an isolated instance			2
" generally the human rights situation , and particularly women 's rights , is deteriorating , " she told @entity2			1
" i am in constant contact with women 's rights groups across the country , and they say they are seeing an increase in violence			1
" this is in part because the @entity1 government does little to implement or enforce the laws that protect women 's rights , she said			1
she also sees it as a consequence of women across the country gaining greater awareness of their rights , which is leading both to a backlash from men and to more cases of violence being reported			0
on top of that , the @entity1 government 's move toward peace and reconciliation talks with the @entity59 has led many people to think the current oppression of women will simply continue as it is , @entity88 said			2
" we need to make sure that we protect the women -- it 's so important that women 's rights in @entity1 are non-negotiable , " she said			1
the alleged involvement of @entity92 's mother - in - law in her abuse is not unusual , @entity88 added , as women often play a role in violence against other women within the family , as do husbands , fathers and brothers			1
and there is a heavy cultural pressure to bear sons , who are viewed as the breadwinners , she said , with the birth of a daughter seen as a burden rather than something to celebrate			0
if the situation of @entity1 women is to improve , @entity88 said , a strong political will is needed at the government level , backed up by strong pressure from the international community			0
" where ( the international community ) puts so much pressure and focus on a military solution , they should also think about the protection of the @entity1 people and @entity1 women , " she said			0
@entity2 's @entity160 contributed to this report .			0
