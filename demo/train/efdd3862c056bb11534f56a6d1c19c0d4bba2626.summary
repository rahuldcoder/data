-- @entity2 pop star @entity1 is catching all sorts of heat after her saturday performance of " @entity6 , mr. president " to one of the world 's most notorious dictators , @entity8			1
" it was our pleasure , and we wish you the very , very happiest birthday , " @entity11 says in a @entity13 video of the performance			1
statements like that feel gross , of course , if you know that @entity8 has been accused of imprisoning political dissidents , imposing " draconian restrictions on freedom of expression and association , " says @entity27 , and , according to the @entity28 , ordering his goons to kill or get rid of stray cats			0
" singing happy birthday to dictators while dissidents and journalists die in their torture chambers ? " human rights lawyer @entity31 ( son of actress @entity33 ) wrote on @entity34			1
" still @entity40 , @ @entity1 ? " he followed - up that tweet with this orthographic quip about the pop star 's visit to the former @entity46 country , squished between @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			1
" more like @entity50 from the bloc , am i right ? " the criticism is fully warranted			0
but there could be a positive here : when @entity1 and other celebrities stumble unknowingly ( yes , apparently unknowingly : a publicist told @entity0 that " had there been knowledge of human right issues of any kind , @entity1 would not have attended			1
" this , in the age of @entity63 ! ) into human rights quagmires , a kind of awareness gets raised			1
@entity1 's concert in @entity68 may at least give the rest of us a chance to learn something about a desperate nation that never would make @entity2 headlines if not for such a celebrity appearance			1
raise your hand if you could name ( much less spell the name of ) @entity68 's president before this weekend ? considering how well - controlled the country 's internet is , i 'll assume you 're not from there and knew almost nothing about the place			1
now that we ( @entity1 , that is ) have your attention , consider these sobering facts : @entity92 ranks @entity68 as one of its " worst of the worst " countries			1
the group says @entity68 is " not an electoral democracy " since " none of the country 's elections ... have been free or fair			1
" additionally : " employment and educational opportunities for ethnic minorities are limited by the government 's promotion of @entity68 national identity			1
freedom of movement is restricted , with a reported blacklist preventing some individuals from leaving the country			0
traditional social and religious norms , inadequate education , and poor economic conditions limit professional opportunities for women , and anecdotal reports suggest that domestic violence is common			0
" @entity27 condemns @entity68 for imprisoning and silencing political opposition figures			2
" as a result of more than two decades of the government 's practice of using imprisonment as a tool for political retaliation , " the group says , " unknown numbers of individuals languish in @entity68 prisons on what appear to be politically motivated charges			2
during the previous ( @entity131 ) , the government rejected an important recommendation to ' account for those prisoners whose fate is unknown			0
' the fate of some of several dozen prisoners convicted in relation to the november 2002 alleged assassination attempt on then - president @entity141 remains unknown , with their whereabouts not disclosed even to their families			0
" @entity68 is basically @entity145 plus oil , as @entity147 writes on the @entity148			2
( hat tip to @entity150 for spotting that			0
specifically , @entity147 says @entity145 has been referred to as " @entity68 without the oil			2
" ) @entity8 ( here 's a pronunciation guide from @entity154 ) hates pets as well as humans			0
@entity157 quotes from a diplomatic cable released by @entity159 : " there have been reports about a recent incident in which a motorist crossed an intersection in front president @entity166 's motorcade as it moved through @entity167			0
several high ranking police officials were fired after the incident , and the driver of the vehicle was reportedly beaten and charged with attempted assassination			0
in another incident , a military official was fired after a cat ran in front of the president 's car as he was traveling to his dacha , " or second home			0
calls and e-mails to @entity68 's embassy in @entity183 were not returned on tuesday morning			2
it would be easy to argue @entity11 's performance served only to legitimize @entity68 's government			1
or that her appearance could serve to paint the country ( inaccurately ) as a modern and welcoming place -- the kind of open , dance - ready society that loves freedom and rocks to " @entity195			0
" exactly the opposite is happening in the wake of her performance , however			0
people are learning a thing or two about how desperate @entity68 is			2
and a diva 's visit with a despot can raise more than awareness			1
after being publicly shamed for performing on behalf of the government of @entity208 dictator @entity207 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 and @entity212 announced in 2011 that they had donated or planned to donate the money they received to charity			0
@entity1 should do the same , as @entity218 columnist @entity217 has suggested			2
in effect , that would mean @entity68 's dictator unwillingly is funding human rights efforts			1
and it would be a sign @entity1 , too , learned something from this experience			2
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity229 .			0

@entity231 @entity1 draws criticism for her performance in @entity68
@entity235 says the " @entity6 " concert actually was productive
he says @entity11 inadvertently lent her celebrity to raising awareness about human rights
@entity229 : " a diva 's visit with a despot can raise more than awareness "
