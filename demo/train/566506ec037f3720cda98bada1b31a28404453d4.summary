@entity0 -- president @entity2 accepted the @entity3 on thursday by talking about war and the limits of nonviolence			1
but he also praised the peacemakers of the past and said the world can and should still strive for peace			0
" let us reach for the world that ought to be , " he told the 1,000 - member audience at @entity13 in @entity14			0
" @entity17 - eyed , we can understand that there will be war , and still strive for peace			0
" the @entity23 committee 's choice of @entity2 as this year 's laureate sparked debate , in part because he is a president waging two wars abroad			1
@entity2 said force is sometimes necessary , but said that is simply " a recognition of history , the imperfections of man and the limits of reason			2
" read a transcript of @entity2 's acceptance speech @entity38 , author and host of @entity1 's " @entity38 : @entity41 , " spoke to @entity1 about the speech @entity1 : what message was president @entity2 trying to send the world in his @entity3 acceptance speech ? @entity38 : the speech reflected his basic philosophy , which is why it worked so well			1
i think @entity2 is somebody who is a realist - idealist			0
he tries to balance idealism with the realities in the world			1
he clearly believes in the idea of doing good in the world , but believes you have to be pragmatic and realizes the dangers of over-reaching			0
@entity1 : will the focus on the @entity58 war being " just " be well received by world leaders ? @entity38 : most of the world supports the war in @entity58			1
the @entity63 approved it , and over 50 countries are participating one way or another , so countries wo n't react negatively			0
@entity2 wanted to remind people , including those in his own party here in the @entity72 , that the @entity58 war has a morally legitimate basis and that there are occasions in history where force is necessary			1
@entity1 : are there any potential pitfalls to spending so much of the speech defending the war on moral grounds ? @entity38 : the great danger of moral certitude is that you get distracted from the practical issue of whether things are working			2
are we creating a stable government ? are we being successful against the @entity90 and @entity91 ? from @entity94 to @entity95 , the question of whether a military action is morally legitimate can overshadow whether it works			0
@entity1 : does the speech give us any window into how @entity2 might conduct @entity72 foreign policy going forward ? @entity38 : the @entity58 speech last week and the @entity23 speech are the two clearest statements of his worldview			1
he is n't making a broad statement like president @entity104 , when he vowed to end tyranny in the world			0
@entity2 says the @entity72 is a force for good , but is engaging with the world and is trying to avoid open - ended commitments			2
@entity2 wants the @entity72 to play a world role that is progressive and idealistic , but remains aware of the practical limitations inherent in trying to operate in a messy world .			2
