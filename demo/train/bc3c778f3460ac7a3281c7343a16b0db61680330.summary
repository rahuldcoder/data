@entity1 president @entity0 said he and @entity1 's first lady were going through " painful moments , " as he faced questions tuesday over an alleged affair with an actress			1
in his first appearance before the media since the allegations surfaced in the @entity1 tabloid closer linking @entity0 romantically to actress @entity12 , the president was immediately asked about his personal life when he handed the floor to journalists following a nearly 40 - minute speech			1
asked whether his partner , @entity17 , was still the first lady of @entity1 , @entity0 said personal affairs should be dealt with in private			1
" everybody in their personal lives can go through hardships			0
this is the case for us , " he said			0
" these are painful moments , but i have one principle : private affairs are dealt with in private			2
this is not the place nor the time to do this			0
" @entity0 and @entity17 are expected next month on a state visit to the @entity33 at the invitation of president @entity35 and his wife , @entity36			1
their itinerary includes a february 11 state dinner at the @entity40			0
speaking at the @entity41 to outline his new - year plans for the economy , @entity0 said he would clarify the situation before the february trip			1
the allegations , which emerged friday , have sparked a media firestorm of a kind not usually seen in @entity1 , where privacy is closely guarded			2
@entity17 was hospitalized shortly after the report appeared			1
" @entity52 scenario " according to @entity1 national daily @entity53 , @entity0 's news conference -- the first of 2014 and only his third in office -- was supposed to be a chance for the embattled leader , who has seen his popularity slump since his 2012 election , to relaunch his agenda			1
instead , it is a " catastrophic scenario , " the newspaper reported -- with him trying to deal with questions about his private life as briefly as possible and turn the focus back to economic matters			0
@entity72 , leader of the opposition @entity73 , told television channel @entity1 5 over the weekend that the allegations were " disastrous for the image of the presidential office , " adding that the story was dominating international media coverage of @entity1			2
former prime minister @entity81 , also of the @entity73 , is quoted by @entity83 affiliate @entity82 as saying that " many people overseas who specialize in ' @entity1 bashing ' are having a field day			2
" asked if there should be moves to formalize the position of the first lady -- in contrast to the @entity33 , the partner of the @entity1 president has no defined status -- @entity81 said that might not be the solution			1
" in @entity1 , we love status			2
we can create a status for the first lady and for the second lady as well , perhaps , " he joked			0
hospitalization @entity104 , head of @entity17 's @entity41 office , told @entity83 on sunday the first lady had been hospitalized since friday			1
he said she " needed rest " and he hoped she would leave the hospital early this week			0
" we all know why she went in after the story came out , " said @entity104 , clearly making the link between the revelations of the magazine and @entity17 's hospitalization			1
@entity0 , 59 , left his longtime common - law wife , @entity117 -- the mother of his four children -- for @entity17 , 48 , before the 2012 presidential election			2
the two are not married but live together , and she makes official state appearances			0
they met when @entity17 was a reporter for @entity124 magazine			2
she still works for the publication			0
right to privacy @entity0 did not tackle the claims in the closer article head - on as he announced ideas to tackle unemployment and measures such as deep public spending cuts to boost economic growth , which he said had to be " as vigorous as possible			0
" the story has however prompted questions in @entity1 media about @entity0 's right to privacy , whether his security may have been jeopardized during his alleged liaisons , and @entity17 's future status as first lady			1
closer reported that @entity0 had been slipping out of the back door of the @entity41 and hopping on a motor scooter driven by a bodyguard to @entity12 's apartment			1
the magazine also said the bodyguard brought croissants to the apartment one morning			0
asked whether his security was jeopardized in this case , the president said , " my security is insured everywhere and all times			0
privately i go around with less security			0
" @entity0 has not confirmed or denied the alleged affair but has threatened legal action			1
a statement from his entourage friday to news agency @entity161 said @entity0 " deeply condemns the attacks on the right to privacy which he has a right to like every other citizen			0
" a survey last month by @entity1 polling organization @entity169 gave @entity0 an approval rating of 22 % , a rise of 2 percentage points from the previous month , when he hit a record low			2
@entity0 , who was elected after campaigning to put growth before austerity and introduce higher taxes on the rich , has been urged by his @entity178 partners and international institutions to be bolder with his economic reforms			0
@entity1 's faltering economic performance last year , accompanied by stubbornly high unemployment figures , led to fears the second - biggest economy in the eurozone could act as a brake on the region 's fragile recovery .			1
