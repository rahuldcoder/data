@entity0 -- the @entity3 administration aims to cut the annual number of new hiv infections in the @entity6 by 25 percent over the next five years , according to a nationwide hiv / aids strategy unveiled tuesday			1
federal officials are also seeking to combat a growing sense of complacency about the disease , partly by reducing the percentage of infected @entity6 who are unaware of their status			1
specifically , the strategy focuses on three key areas : reducing the number of people who become infected , increasing access to care , and decreasing @entity21 - related health disparities			1
" the actions we take now will build upon a legacy of global leadership , national commitment , and sustained efforts on the part of @entity6 from all parts of the country and all walks of life to end the @entity21 epidemic in the @entity6 and around the world , " president @entity3 said in a memorandum sent to a number of federal departments and agencies			1
" the question is not whether we know what to do , but whether we will do it , " the president said tuesday evening at a @entity41 reception			2
" whether we will fulfill those obligations ...			0
" the @entity41 's goal , @entity48 secretary @entity47 noted , is to make new infections rare while ensuring that those who are infected have an " unfettered access to high quality life - extending care free from stigma and discrimination			1
" among other things , the strategy calls for an intensification of hiv prevention efforts among communities where the disease is most heavily concentrated			2
it highlights the need to steer federal grant money toward organizations dealing with high - risk groups such as gay and bisexual men and illegal substance users			0
it also cites the importance of greater education and " scientifically proven biomedical and behavioral approaches " to reduce the spread of the disease , including the use of condoms , abstinence , hiv testing , and access to sterile needles and syringes			2
while the spread of the disease has slowed since the 1980s , an estimated 56,000 @entity6 still contract @entity21 each year , according to @entity85 director @entity84			1
roughly 1.1 million @entity6 are currently living with @entity21			1
approximately 1 in 5 infected @entity6 is unaware of his or her status , according to the @entity89			2
the plan does not call for a major increase in the roughly $ 19 billion the federal government spends on hiv / aids programs , though administration officials on tuesday cited new benefits provided by the recently passed health care reform law			1
one leading hiv / aids activist , however , was sharply critical of the administration 's strategy			1
@entity100 , president of the @entity102 - based @entity101 , told @entity1 in an interview that " when you see what this administration has done on @entity108 , you have to give them very low grades			2
" @entity3 has " consistently underfunded @entity108 " programs , @entity100 said			0
the president " did not mention the word @entity108 for the first five months of his administration			0
this national @entity108 strategy has been worked on for 15 months , [ and ] i think it could have been done in 15 minutes			0
there 's nothing new in it			0
" @entity100 criticized the administration 's intention to redirect money to those groups at greatest risk of contracting @entity108			0
" it 's not good to pit one group against another and it 's unnecessary , " he said			0
" the bottom line is that we should be seeking to get all sexually active people to get an hiv test			0
" the @entity41 announcement came less than a week after a group of scientists published a study saying they had made a key discovery that could help in the development of an hiv vaccine			2
scientists at the @entity138 said last week that they had found three human antibodies that neutralize more than 90 percent of the current circulating @entity21 - 1 strains			0
" this is significant because we 've now found antibodies that are good templates for hiv vaccine development , " said @entity141 , co-author of the study published last thursday in the journal @entity144			0
more than 18,000 people with @entity108 die each year in the @entity6 , according to the @entity89			1
more than 576,000 people with @entity108 have died in the @entity6 since the epidemic began			1
the @entity152 says @entity108 accounted for an estimated 2 million deaths in 2008 , and more than 33 million people are living with @entity21 worldwide			1
@entity1 's @entity155 and @entity156 contributed to this report			0
