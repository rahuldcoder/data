-- @entity1 has begun rolling out a full redesign of @entity3			1
the changes will make the pages look and operate more like user profiles			1
the new @entity5 redesign was first seen in december , when @entity1 accidentally launched it and quickly took it down			1
the update not only removed tabs , but it gave page admins the ability to post and comment on other @entity3 through a " @entity14 as page " feature			1
those prototype features have made the cut for today 's launch			0
as @entity1 's @entity21 , the lead product manager for @entity3 , explained to me earlier today , the company has wanted to redesign @entity3 ever since it launched the profile redesign			1
" we strongly believe you should have consistent experiences when possible , " @entity21 said			0
the big difference everyone will notice will be the new layout			0
the left - hand menu for editing pages has been removed in favor of a new navigation menu that replaces the old tabbing system			0
and like the @entity36 redesign , the left - hand " information " box is also gone			0
however , page admins can now add info about their brand at the top of the page under the main title			1
the right - hand menu has also been tweaked			0
there is now a section that features the page 's admins ( if you so choose ) as well as a section that shows users how many of their friends have also " liked " that particular page			2
finally , just like profiles , a page can now feature relevant photos at the top			2
this could lead to some very creative uses for @entity3			2
log in as your @entity1 page there are some other notable differences between the new @entity3 and the old version , especially for page admins			1
the " @entity14 " feature gives admins the ability to interact with the rest of @entity1 as a page , not an individual			1
for example , i could log in as @entity0 and start commenting and " liking " things on @entity3 that have " liked " @entity0			0
admins will also see a different @entity76 if they are logged in as their page ; it will display the most important news from the pages you 've " liked			1
" " a page can now use @entity1 as if they were an individual with the ability to interact with other pages , " @entity21 said			1
" it provides interesting content when people are visiting the page			0
" @entity0 : what the new @entity1 pages mean for users & owners pages ca n't do everything a user can , though			1
most importantly , they can not post on a user 's wall or comment on his or her status			2
the lone exception is for a user who has opted for the " everybody " privacy setting ; pages can comment on status updates for those individuals			2
the other update @entity1 is adding is an " everyone " filter that brings the most interesting and engaging posts from a page 's community to the top of the page			2
this makes it easier for users and admins to easily find the most " liked " and commented - on conversations on a particular page			0
the new @entity3 are also smart enough to filter out posts that are not in a language you speak			0
the new design launches today as a preview for @entity128 admins			0
before switching , they can check to see what their page will look like and tweak elements of the design before launch			0
the company is also releasing a @entity136 and a manual to explain the new design			0
admins will have until march 10 to switch over though , before @entity1 automatically updates every page to the new design			1
