-- there were goals , there was choreographed dancing , there were moments of great footballing beauty , but @entity8 -- one of the teams to excite most at this thrilling @entity12 finals -- is going home after friday 's quarterfinal defeat at the hands of @entity16 in @entity17			1
strikes from the center - back pairing of captain @entity20 and @entity21 put @entity16 into an unassailable lead and , despite a late penalty by @entity24 , the tournament host held on to win 2 - 1			1
the home fans ' jubilation was dampened , however , by an injury to @entity16 's star striker @entity29 , who was stretchered off in what seemed like considerable pain in the game 's closing moments and will miss the rest of the tournament			1
the result marks the first time @entity16 has reached the semifinal stage since winning the title in @entity40 and @entity41 in 2002 , and sets up an intriguing clash against @entity43 on tuesday -- a repeat of that year 's final			1
" i think @entity29 wo n't be able to play , " coach @entity46 told reporters after the game , before the team 's doctor revealed the 22 - year - old forward had a fractured vertebra from being kneed in the back by @entity8 's @entity54			1
@entity43 overcame @entity55 in the day 's earlier quarterfinal in @entity57 thanks to an early goal from defender @entity59			1
in the sweaty evening heat of the @entity62 , however , it was another pair of defenders who were the unlikely heroes			0
@entity20 opened the scoring after seven minutes , tucking home a @entity29 corner with his knee , and the @entity70 star was then in thick of it once more at the other end moments later , blocking a shot from @entity74			1
@entity20 was criticized heavily after apparently refusing to take the sixth penalty in @entity16 's round of 16 shootout victory over @entity78 last saturday			1
he was all action here , however			0
marshaling the back line and flying into tackles when required			0
but a yellow card midway through the second half means he will be suspended and miss the semifinal			2
the @entity8 players composed themselves as the first half progressed , coming more into the game despite the rough - house treatment handed out to star player @entity24			1
on at least four occasions the @entity90 star was subject to the stray boot of @entity16 's midfield enforcer @entity93			1
still , the home team continued to have the better chances			0
hulk and @entity97 came close with a snap - shot that @entity8 keeper @entity99 palmed away and a header that flashed over respectively			1
the second half commenced at a far slower pace and there was little of note until @entity20 was booked for blocking a kick out from @entity105			2
@entity8 did have the ball in the net after 66 minutes as @entity108 bundled the ball over the line after a scramble in the @entity113 box			2
but a linesman 's offside flag cut short the nascent celebrations			0
moments later there was a goal , although it was to come at the other end			0
@entity96 was fouled by @entity120 yards from goal and @entity21 stepped up to crash a spectacular free - kick beyond the despairing @entity105			1
it was a remarkable strike that dipped and swerved as it arrowed into the top corner of the net			0
there seemed no way back for @entity8 now			2
but " @entity8 " were handed a lifeline with 12 minutes to go after goalkeeper @entity130 scythed down substitute @entity131			2
@entity24 did the honors from the penalty spot , sending @entity130 the wrong way to score his sixth goal of the tournament -- two more than closest rivals @entity29 , @entity138 and @entity139			1
all of a sudden , the game was back on			0
@entity8 pressed and threw caution to the wind with @entity108 playing as an auxiliary striker			1
but when one final corner kick delivery drifted beyond @entity130 's goal in the 95th minute there was time left for little else			0
@entity46 's side has now overcome the barrier that has proved too high at the last two @entity12 tournaments			1
however , @entity16 has not yet looked like a team certain to become world champion for a record - extending sixth time -- as its demanding public expects -- despite having world - class talents like @entity29 , @entity20 and @entity157			1
yet somehow they find themselves only a game away from next sunday 's final			0
stuttering performances and the occasional stroke of good fortune against @entity165 and @entity166 in the group stages and once more against @entity78 has hardly inspired confidence in " a @entity16			2
" poor showings from the likes of strikers @entity96 and @entity97 have been singled out for particular scorn , although the former put in a solid performance against @entity8			2
much was also made in the @entity113 media of 2002 's winning coach @entity46 -- a man who prides himself on being a father figure to his players -- bringing in a psychologist to speak to his team after many broke down in tears during the national anthems and once again after the dramatic penalty kicks victory over @entity78			1
was this team soft and mentally weak ? are the expectations of 200 million football - mad @entity113 proving oppressive and too much to bear ? " @entity188 " truculently replied earlier this week that journalists who did n't like his methods could " go to hell			0
" @entity193 said reporters took heed or not , surely lack of maturity is not an accusation that can be leveled against @entity16 now			2
the men in yellow were nothing if not committed , controlled and tactically astute , biting into tackles and closing down with an intensity that ruffled their opponents			0
several gestured towards the crowd throughout the contest to increase the noise and crank up the pressure			0
@entity8 , by comparison , can hardly have been accused of being afraid			0
@entity210 's team has played with a style and confidence throughout the tournament that has been a joy to watch for neutral observers			0
the delight the entire squad takes in their choreographed dancing celebrations , meanwhile , speaks to the relaxed vibe created by the coach , previously a @entity12 quarterfinalist with his native @entity222 in 2006			0
tellingly , however , @entity8 has only ever beaten @entity16 twice and never in @entity16 -- a run that extends all the way back to 1945 and the formative years of the @entity225			1
that record will now last at least until the two sides meet next in qualification for the next @entity12 in the coming years			0
still , today 's @entity8 players will be heading back homes as heroes , the bright hope of a new generation as the country itself moves on from a dark past			2
it was 20 years ago this week that defender @entity238 was murdered in @entity239 upon returning from the 1994 @entity12 in the @entity240 where he scored a cruel own - goal			2
thankfully , those dark days are largely gone and @entity244 hopes will be high when the campaign for @entity246 2018 begins			0
@entity16 , however , is still involved in 2014 and will be going to the semifinals in @entity248 .			0

@entity16 beats @entity8 in @entity12 quarterfinal in @entity17
goals from @entity20 and @entity21 secure 2 - 1 victory
@entity24 scores late penalty to reduce *deficit*
@entity16 's star striker @entity29 may miss semifinal against @entity43
