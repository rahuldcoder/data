-- @entity1 disappeared saturday somewhere over @entity2			1
authorities do n't know where the plane is or what happened to it			1
here are answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about this baffling disappearance : did the plane go off course ? possibly , but not certainly			1
while accounts from @entity16 authorities have been at times confusing and sometimes conflicting , authorities said wednesday that radar picked up an unidentified aircraft flying over the @entity19 into the @entity20 early saturday night			1
that 's hundreds of miles from the @entity25 - bound plane 's flight path			1
but authorities cautioned they are n't sure the blip was @entity1			1
on tuesday another @entity16 official said there was n't any evidence the plane had turned around			1
and early thursday ( wednesday evening @entity32 ) , @entity31 announced one of its satellites had spotted " a suspected crash area at sea " -- including three " suspected floating objects " up to 24 meters ( 79 feet ) long			0
we could find out more soon , as @entity16 officials have asked international experts to help interpret the data			2
what is a transponder ? it 's a radio transmitter in the cockpit that works with ground radar			0
when it receives a radar signal , it returns a code with the aircraft 's position , altitude and call sign			2
air traffic controllers use the signals to determine a plane 's speed and direction			2
why did it stop working ? that 's one of many million - dollar questions			1
the transponder is situated between the pilots and can be disabled with a twist of the wrist , but former airline captain @entity67 said that because of the vital information -- and thus , protection -- the transponder provides , it 's highly unlikely a pilot would turn it off			0
without the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder , it 's difficult to say who was in the cockpit and exactly what happened , @entity67 said			1
experts also give conflicting opinions : while one expert says the circumstances point to someone -- perhaps a hijacker -- deliberately turning the plane around , another says a catastrophic power failure could explain the anomalies			2
how does the search work ? authorities break huge swaths of @entity92 into much smaller grids			1
then , planes or ships scour the grids to eliminate them as candidates for the crash site			0
as of wednesday , 42 ships and 39 planes from a dozen countries were involved			0
the grids are massive and make up 27,000 miles of land and sea , including the southern tip of @entity104 , @entity105 , about half of @entity16 and parts of the @entity108 , @entity109 of @entity105 and @entity20			0
could ' crowdsourcing ' help find the plane ? ostensibly , sure			2
@entity112 firm @entity111 has one of the most advanced commercial satellite networks , and its images of the @entity20 and @entity109 of @entity105 can capture details as small as a baseball field 's home plate , the longest side of which is 17 inches			0
volunteers can flag anything they find interesting , but so many answered the call this week that the firm 's website crashed			0
( the website appeared to be up wednesday )			0
also , there 's the troubling size of the search area			2
is this the first time a plane has vanished ? not at all			2
several plane crashes have posed problematic searches -- 1988 's @entity134 103 , 1996 's @entity135 and 1999 's @entity136 , among them			2
but perhaps none was as a tricky as @entity139 447 , which went down after departing @entity140 on june 1 , 2009			0
it took four searches and almost two years before the bulk of the wreckage and majority of bodies were recovered			0
the voice and data recorders were n't found on the ocean floor until may 2011			1
how does a plane disappear ? there 's no simple answer here , especially when you consider the bevy of technology on a state - of - the - art jetliner , which includes @entity158 and @entity159 radios , automatic beacons , @entity161 and computer communications systems			1
it does n't help that @entity1 's flight path is unclear and that the search areas include vast waters and sparsely populated jungles and mountains			1
were the pilots experienced ? the short answer is yes			0
@entity171 , 27 , joined @entity172 in 2007 and was first officer on the flight			1
he has 2,763 flying hours and was transitioning to the @entity175 777 - 200 after finishing training in a flight simulator			1
the pilot , capt. @entity178 , 53 , has 18,365 flying hours			0
he joined the airline in 1981			0
there are reports @entity171 let passengers in the cockpit on another flight ? is that legal ? @entity187 has told several media outlets that @entity171 invited her and a friend into the cockpit for most of a 2011 flight from @entity105 to @entity16			1
while this would be a strict violation of @entity195 regulations put in place after the 9/11 attacks , the legality would vary from country to country			0
upon learning of @entity202 ' claim , @entity172 said it was " shocked , " while former @entity195 @entity203 chief of staff @entity204 said such behavior by a pilot " just violates every code of conduct			1
" is foul play possible ? hijackers ? terrorism ? the @entity213 and @entity214 are n't ruling it out , but to be fair , authorities are n't ruling out much at this point			1
it 's highly suspicious that the plane may have turned around			2
those suspicions are further fueled by the loss of communication with the plane , considering the aircraft had " redundant electrical systems " that would have to be disabled			1
@entity226 , former vice chairman of the @entity227 , said his first thought upon hearing the circumstances of @entity1 's mysterious disappearance was that it blew up , but even then , an explosion would not be hard - and - fast evidence of terrorism			1
what about those passengers with stolen passports ? @entity237 says it has identified the men as @entity240 @entity239 , 18 , and @entity241 , 29 , and @entity16 investigators say neither of them has any apparent connection to terrorist organizations			2
stolen passports certainly are n't indicative of terrorism			2
in fact , @entity237 says passengers flew without having their travel documents checked against its lost - and - stolen passport database more than a billion times in 2013			1
among the reasons someone might use a stolen passport : to immigrate illegally to another country , to import goods without being taxed or to smuggle stolen goods , people , drugs or weapons			0
what about pilot error ? certainly possible			0
that 's what the investigation showed happened with the 2009 @entity139 flight , though there was an element of mechanical failure as well			1
in that case , though , there was also inclement weather -- not the case with @entity1			0
as of wednesday , nothing suggests that pilot error played a role in the flight 's disappearance			1
so , could mechanical failure explain it ? it 's one of the stronger possibilities			0
the absence so far of any debris field could suggest the pilot had to make an emergency landing on water and it later sunk beneath the sea , but there is still the mystery of the distress signal			2
there 's was n't one			2
however , aviation consultant @entity294 has said it 's possible there was a power problem , the backup power lasted only an hour and the pilot attempted to turn back to " the airports and a region he knows			0
" there 's also the possibility of a tail or wing ripping off			0
this particular @entity175 suffered a clipped wing tip in the past , but @entity175 repaired it			0
another frightening possibility is that a window or door failed , which would allow ambient temperatures of 60 degrees below zero into the cabin , creating a freezing fog and giving crew members only seconds to don oxygen masks before they were disoriented and then incapacitated			2
could it have been hit by a meteor ? there was a known meteor in the area at takeoff , but this seems to be atop a list of strange conspiracy theories popping up in the absence of empirical data explaining the plane 's disappearance			1
given what little is known about the flight path , it seems like a long , long shot that a meteor is to blame			0
what about reports that passengers ' cell phones continued operating after @entity1 's disappearance ? please see earlier question about meteors and conspiracy theories			1
when phones are disabled or turned off -- which would presumably happen after a plane crash -- calls to those cell phones do n't ring , but go to directly to voice mail			1
friends and loved ones of the missing passengers , however , reported ringing when they called			0
technology industry analyst @entity347 says a call would first connect to a network before trying to locate the end user , and the ringing sound callers hear masks the silence they would otherwise hear while waiting for the connection to be made			0
" if it does n't find the phone after a few minutes , after a few rings , then typically , it disconnects and that 's what 's happening , " he said			0
interactive : what happened to @entity1 ?			0

answers to common questions in the disappearance of @entity172 flight
the @entity25 - bound aircraft disappeared saturday with 239 passengers , crew aboard
authorities still do n't know where it is or what happened to it ; search is *ongoing*
many conspiracy theories have emerged in the absence of hard data on the plane
