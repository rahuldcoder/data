-- you probably heard the story			1
it is , after all , so last week			1
a wealthy banker goes out to lunch with a colleague			1
the banker disdainfully leaves a 1 % tip on a $ 133 bill with the message , " get a real job			1
" the colleague , who runs a blog called " @entity13 , " takes a picture of the receipt , which then goes viral -- first on @entity16 , then on @entity17 and @entity18 , soon everywhere ( including @entity0 )			1
it was a hoax , however , though it took a few days before the restaurant found proof the original receipt had been photoshopped			1
by that time , despite some disclaimers along the way , the bill had become water - cooler gospel and left outrage in its wake			1
so it goes on the @entity32 , where errors , mistakes and knee - jerk reactions can be let loose at the click of a button			1
@entity0 photos : our mobile addiction sure , it 's been that way since your grandmother e-mailed you the story about the @entity47 chocolate - chip cookie recipe			1
but in an increasingly connected world where social networking has made us all news sources , that means missteps and misinformation get issued -- and repeated -- more quickly than ever			1
@entity56 is declared dead , @entity55 lets fly with profane rants , and it all makes the rounds before anyone has time to think			1
" there 's never been such pressure to speak before one knows , " says science writer @entity63 , who traced the increasing speed of society in his book " faster " and the deluge of data in last year 's " the information			1
" there 's always been a desire to gather and disseminate news , he points out , " but never until now has it been global and instantaneous			2
" we want information , but more than that , we want it quickly -- and thanks to smartphones , which now comprise the majority of cell phones in the @entity82 , we 're never far away from the latest bits of media			1
moreover , with cellular companies promoting blazing " @entity86 " speeds and trying to expand their networks , it 's harder and harder to be out of touch -- and easier and easier to give in to the twitch of the clicker finger			2
and accuracy ? speed rules , baby			2
even when your phone attempts to helpfully autocorrect a hastily written text , the result is as often mocked as appreciated			2
we want the world to listen , and we want it now			2
" everyone now has a global platform on which they can shout their opinions and voice their beliefs , " says @entity102 , a psychology professor at @entity103 and former president of the @entity105			2
but people have n't become more cautious about putting words out there , he adds -- even if they 're wrong			2
" there 's an old economic principle , that bad money drives out good , " he says			2
" one thing that worries me is that bad information is driving out good			2
" me first ! of course , the desire to be first , even at the risk of being wrong , is nothing new			2
but social networks and real - time internet portability have combined to spawn errors and reactions at an increasingly breakneck pace , particularly on @entity17 , which -- with its brevity and scope -- makes it easy to disseminate clickbacks and comebacks in 140 characters or fewer			1
actor @entity135 , mistaking @entity17 's private and public spheres , accidentally released his phone number to the entire @entity139 , then backtracked with a joke			2
celebrity rumors roar through all the time , causing quick kerfuffles as they 're checked and then dismissed			2
others , however , are more dramatic			2
last month controversial hip - hop singer @entity55 posted a defiant message after the @entity145 -- a tweet that did n't go over well			1
soon afterward , @entity55 ( or his handlers ) deleted all evidence of his @entity17 tantrum , but not before bloggers had grabbed screen shots of the offending missives			1
several news services initially tweeted that @entity154 rep. @entity56 had died in the @entity156 shootings last year			2
when @entity56 was confirmed to be alive , some deleted their early posts			1
actor @entity159 , who has close to 10 million @entity17 followers , tweeted a protest of @entity164 coach @entity163 's firing -- before realizing why @entity163 was being let go			0
@entity159 later apologized , deleted his earlier messages and finally put his @entity17 account under the control of his publicists			1
wrong or right , speed is exciting , says @entity63			0
" the fact is , we love this fast pace			0
we 're exhilarated by it , " he says			0
" we 're happy to be able to reach in a pocket and press a button or speak to our device and instantaneously get an answer to a question -- even if we know that the answer is not 100 % reliable			1
" and being first ( or , to many @entity32 commenters , " first ! " ) is even better : the " primacy effect , " it 's called in psychology			0
we tend to remember the first items in a series more than later entries			0
with speed of the essence , some websites have built a following by trafficking in rumors and uncertainties			0
in tech , of course , there are any number of sites devoted to all things @entity198 , which seize on the smallest bits of information , then watch as the unconfirmed reports get picked up by larger tech sites until they go mainstream			0
the sociologist @entity204 observed that people have " front - stage " and " backstage " presentations of themselves -- the former a polished form intended for public consumption , the latter raw and unedited			0
" i think there 's more and more of the backstage leaking into day - to - day conversation , " says @entity211 , a pop culture professor at @entity212			0
that 's not necessarily a bad thing			0
for corporations such as @entity198 , an outburst of rumors certainly creates ( or maintains ) interest			0
the availability of smartphones encourages citizen journalism			0
and the ability to post quickly means that misinformation can also be corrected quickly , often after the @entity139 flags an error			1
@entity229 the flip side , however , plays off @entity102 's concern that bad information will drive out good			0
" you can do a fast correction , but it hardly ever has the value of the original , " he points out			0
social networks are also useful in spreading propaganda and disinformation , observes @entity240 , a professor of informatics at @entity242			1
it 's the latest twist on unwittingly forwarding viruses via e-mail			0
@entity240 , who directs @entity242 's @entity246 and @entity247 , has helped develop @entity229 , a system to analyze @entity17 posts that he was inspired to set up after the 2010 @entity251 special senate election			0
an activist group created several fake @entity17 accounts and put out misleading claims about one candidate ; thousands of followers retweeted the information			0
though @entity17 quickly disabled the accounts , the information was spread widely enough to rank highly in @entity260 results			1
@entity229 attempts to find out who 's responsible for the initial message , how it has been spread and determine if the message is true			0
there are some tip - offs , @entity240 observes , such as if the initial message comes from a now - inactive account or one with a suspicious name			1
( in the case of the 1 % receipt , the " future ex-banker 's " blog was inactive by the time other sites started sniffing around , though it was thought that he was remaining anonymous for less suspicious reasons			1
) americans may associate such disinformation campaigns with domestic politics , but they have also taken root overseas , @entity240 adds			0
as social media has become a key tool in quickly spreading the word about meetings and protests -- such as the world saw during the @entity288 -- it can also be used against such efforts			1
during @entity293 's current election campaign , for example , fake accounts posted inaccurate information , making it very difficult for protesters to coordinate through social media , he says			1
given the rush of information on the @entity299 -- and that ever - itchy clicker finger -- the best strategy may be a little self - control , says @entity103 's @entity102			0
though , he adds , it 's not easy , particularly with a generation that has come of age with the latest technologies and thinks nothing of not thinking			0
" in this world of hyper - stimulation , how do you develop kids who are reflective , who can think before they act ? " he says			0
" that 's going to be extremely important going forward , because there 's so much opportunity for stimulation			0
" better to take a breath , have the facts straight -- or risk adding to the flood of error			0
it 's a truism that certainly predates the @entity32			0
" a lie can travel halfway ' round the world while the truth is putting on its shoes , " @entity322 once said			0

thanks to social media , missteps and misinformation get repeated more quickly than ever
@entity334 @entity55 posted profane tweets after the @entity145 , then deleted them
a story about a banker leaving a 1 % restaurant tip went viral before it was revealed a hoax
mistakes *online* can be fixed quickly , but not before damage is done
