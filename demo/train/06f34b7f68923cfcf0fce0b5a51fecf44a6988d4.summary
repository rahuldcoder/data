-- despite the worldwide economic downturn it seems there is one commodity that remains as valuable as ever			1
with media companies around the world paying record sums for broadcasting rights , the @entity10 -- with its array of world - class players -- continues to prove a hugely marketable			1
@entity13 won an @entity10 competition that was beamed into 600m homes			1
with the new 2009 - 2010 football season approaching , the @entity10 appears to have usurped every other domestic league as the sporting product of choice for most international broadcasters			1
the fact that companies are still willing to hang their financial hats on the @entity10 , despite increased global uncertainty , is a testament to the large audiences the thrills and excitement of the competition can draw			2
and , with the division 's international broadcasting rights for the next three years currently up for tender , there appears no sign that financial constraints are hindering the bidding process			1
a @entity10 spokesman told @entity0 : " currently we have 39 international rights broadcast holders , beaming the @entity10 into 211 countries worldwide			1
" @entity10 matches are played into 600 million homes around the world , with an estimated audience of four billion viewers and there is no sign that the huge interest in the product is subsiding in any way			1
" the spokesman added : " the quality of the @entity10 stimulates interest to markets everywhere and attracts audiences from all over the globe			2
" it 's a very polished product			0
the grounds are full , the atmosphere is passionate and the top clubs attract supporters from every corner of the globe			0
" if broadcasters are going to invest in any sporting property , they are going to choose the one that brings in the biggest audiences , which in turn makes it the most attractive for advertisers			0
" the @entity10 is touted by many as the " most competitive " in @entity73 , but pinning all you financial strategy on one product is a dangerous game -- as one broadcaster recently found to its cost			2
@entity81 - based broadcaster @entity80 , which also had major audiences in @entity84 and the @entity85 , had an impressive portfolio of sporting rights and events at its disposal			0
but the company 's purchase of 46 @entity10 matches , for Â£ 131 million ( $ 215m ) was the centerpiece of its coverage for two seasons -- a figure they hoped to recoup from customer subscriptions			1
but when the company lost the rights to half of their games , meaning they could show only 23 matches of the upcoming campaign the @entity105 operation was forced to cease trading due to a projected loss in subscriptions			2
@entity85 broadcaster , @entity110 , quickly snapped up the rights in a bid to increase their market share , a policy that makes sense according to football business expert @entity117 , of sport sponsorship company @entity118			0
" not only is the quality of the product excellent , but the fact that the @entity10 is full of players from all over the world makes it both viable and successful , " @entity117 said			1
" unlike some other major leagues , it is not a foregone conclusion who wins the @entity10			0
there is a greater distribution of top players across the teams than in any other league and that makes it both interesting and exciting			0
" in recent seasons we have seen the growth in popularity in @entity139 and @entity140			0
in the past , countries like @entity142 have tried to down - play the @entity10 in an attempt to promote their own domestic competitions			0
" however , the demand and popularity of the league has been too great for these countries not to broadcast matches , and now they embrace it completely			0

the @entity10 's international rights are currently up for tender
despite current economic downturn the @entity10 is in high demand
@entity10 matches are played into 600 million homes around the world
