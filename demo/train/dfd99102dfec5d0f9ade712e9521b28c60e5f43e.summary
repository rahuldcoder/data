@entity1 special operations units were sent into @entity3 this summer to rescue @entity1 journalist @entity4 and other hostages held by @entity7 militants , a @entity1 official told @entity8			1
several dozen of the most elite @entity1 commandos from units like @entity12 and @entity13 flew in aboard helicopters but could n't find the hostages , including @entity4 , whose grisly execution was captured on video and released this week by @entity18 , the terror group that refers to itself as the @entity19			1
" unfortunately , the mission was not successful because the hostages were not present at the targeted location , " @entity21 spokesman rear adm. @entity20 said on wednesday			2
it 's the latest revelation about @entity4 's final days in the hands of @entity18 , which taunted his family in an e-mail a week ago , saying he would be killed			1
" the message was vitriolic and filled with rage against the @entity1			1
it was deadly serious , " said @entity31 , ceo of the online publication @entity33 , which employed @entity4			1
" obviously , we hoped and prayed that would not be the case			0
... sadly , they showed no mercy			0
" @entity31 told the @entity40 that the captors originally demanded a ransom sum of 100 million euros ( $ 132.5 million ) from @entity4 's family and @entity33			1
then came the message sent to @entity4 's family last week			1
" there was no demand , " @entity31 said			0
@entity48 : @entity18 is a ' cancer ' @entity48 says isis a ' cancer ' that must be eradicated in the video , which @entity8 is not showing , @entity4 is seen on his knees as a man cloaked in black , his face covered , stands behind him			1
the video of his killing also shows another @entity1 journalist , believed to be @entity59			1
the militant in the video , who speaks @entity62 with what sounds like a @entity65 accent , says the other @entity1 's life hangs in the balance , depending on what president @entity48 does next in @entity69			1
but the threat did little to curb @entity1 military operations in @entity69 , with @entity1 warplanes carrying out at least 14 airstrikes against @entity18 targets			1
calling isis a " cancer , " @entity48 said the @entity1 " will continue to confront this hateful terrorism and replace it with a sense of hope and civility			1
" several @entity18 operatives were killed in the special operation earlier this summer that tried to rescue @entity4 and others , the @entity1 official said			1
no @entity1 personnel were killed , but one was slightly wounded			1
fighters jets and surveillance aircraft provided overhead protection to the troops			2
who is the @entity18 ? @entity4 's father : they showed no mercy messages from @entity4 's captors began last fall , @entity31 of @entity33 said			1
@entity4 , a freelance journalist , was on assignment when he disappeared on november 22 , 2012 , in northwest @entity3 , near the border with @entity98			2
" the captors never messaged a lot			2
there was a very limited number with a very specific purpose			1
... they made demands , " @entity31 said			0
some messages were political and some were financial			2
then came the final message last week , without any demand			0
@entity4 's family , according to @entity31 , responded in an e-mail , pleading for mercy and asking for more time			1
they did not hear back			0
the captors showed no mercy , @entity4 's father , @entity114 , told reporters on wednesday , breaking down in tears			1
@entity4 's family appears to have been among the journalist 's final thoughts			1
in the execution video posted tuesday to @entity122 , @entity4 reads a message , presumably scripted in part , if not all , by his captors			1
" i wish i had more time			0
i wish i could have the hope for freedom to see my family once again , " he can be heard saying			2
@entity4 's parents , flanked by one of his brothers , talked to reporters about their son 's plight			1

there is no reason for their slaughter			0
" @entity4 , 40 , previously had been taken captive in @entity162			2

afterward , he said that what saddened him most was knowing that he was causing his family to worry			2
his parents talked about asking him why he wanted to return to conflict zones			0
" why do firemen keep going back to blazing homes ? " @entity144 told reporters			0
" this was his passion			0
he was motivated by what he thought was doing the right thing ... that gave him energy to continue despite the risk			0
" his mother said she remembered him telling her , " @entity178 , i found my passion			0
