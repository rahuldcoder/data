@entity0 , @entity1 -- when i was a little boy , my dad and i would sit on the floor next to his old reel - to - reel tape deck , taking turns talking into it and playing our voices back -- the same reel - to - reel he unwittingly used to gain his 15 minutes of fame			0
it was october 3 , 1951 , when @entity16 , a 26 - year - old travel agent living with his parents in @entity18 , set up the deck next to a radio before setting off to work in @entity21			1
he asked his mom to record the 9th inning of the third game of the @entity25 - @entity26 playoffs			0
what he and my grandmother captured turned out to be the only known recording at the time of @entity32 ' famous call of @entity35 's game - winning home run , " the @entity26 win the pennant ! the @entity26 win the pennant ! " @entity37 : @entity35 tops list of 10 most memorable home runs my dad 's reward was a tape cartridge , $ 100 and access to box seats at the @entity46 the next season -- a pittance for which my mom often needled him			1
those memories came flooding back this week when i heard the news that @entity35 had died at his @entity55 , @entity1 , home at age 86			1
@entity35 's " @entity62 " was heard often at our home , each time i asked my dad to tell me once more how he saved the call			1
he kept the original tape safely boxed up , instead playing one of the @entity66 records of the call that @entity32 ' sponsor pressed as gifts to its dealers			2
for a long time , no one but a handful of friends and family knew the real story of my dad 's role in helping immortalize a bit of baseball history			1
then , on the 50th anniversary of the game , the @entity80 ran an interview with @entity84			0
his local paper , the @entity85 , did a similar story			0
accounts of his recording later appeared in books such as " the @entity90 " and @entity92 's " @entity91			0
" @entity93 even captured the event in his 1997 novel , " @entity96 , " referring to @entity84 only as " a man on 12th street in @entity18			2
" here 's how @entity84 and the @entity80 told the story : " ' i knew i would n't be able to listen to the broadcast , and i knew something was going to happen , ' said @entity16			2
... ' it was the third game of the playoffs			0
that kind of game had to be climactic , even if it was a blowout			0
' " was @entity16 's mother , @entity105 , a baseball fan ? no. was she paying strict attention to the game ? no , he said , ' she was paying attention to her only son			1
' ... from the @entity37 vault : the @entity112 hit the @entity113 " the night after the game , @entity16 wrote @entity32 to ask if anyone at @entity116 had recorded the game ; if not , he would lend him his			1
@entity32 replied quickly , and used the tape to make records as @entity121 gifts			0
... " in later years , when @entity32 related the tale of the tape , he would refer to @entity16 as a @entity125 fan who made the tape so he could hear the voice of the @entity26 weep when @entity18 won			1
a good yarn , but untrue			0
'' ' i was a @entity130 fan from 1933 on , when i was 8 , ' @entity16 said			0
" i 'd been thinking about @entity35 , @entity32 and @entity84 just the other day when my son and i went to our first @entity133 game of the season -- our first game since @entity84 died a year ago in april			1
it was a little before 7 p.m. at @entity0 's @entity138 , and the @entity133 were about to face the @entity26 -- now long since relocated to @entity139			2
my son and i were sitting down to eat on the stadium 's terrace when the matrix board began playing a video introducing the visitors			0
images of past pennants were flashing on the screen when it suddenly hit me -- these are the same @entity26 that once called @entity150 's @entity46 home			1
and before i knew it , they were playing the call i 've come to know so well -- @entity35 hitting his " long fly ... into the lower deck of the left - field stands			2
" once more , " the @entity26 win the pennant ! the @entity26 win the pennant ! the @entity26 win the pennant ! the @entity26 win the pennant ! ... the @entity26 win the pennant ! and they 're going crazy			1
they 're going crazy ! '' i wanted to phone @entity84 and tell him about it , at the same time realizing i could n't -- that i 'd even told the story about the call at his funeral			2
and then i knew he was with us there in the stadium , smiling down on a perfect summer evening of baseball .			0
