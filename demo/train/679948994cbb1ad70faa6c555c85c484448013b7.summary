the @entity0 , or the " @entity2 particle , " which was discovered last year , garnered two physicists the @entity4 in physics on tuesday , but it did n't go to the scientists who detected it			1
nearly 50 years ago , @entity8 of @entity9 and @entity10 of the @entity11 had the foresight to predict that the particle existed			1
now , the octogenarian pair share the @entity4 in physics in recognition of a theoretical brilliance that was vindicated by the particle 's discovery last year			1
the @entity18 awarded the prize to them			2
@entity10 and @entity8 's theories behind the elusive @entity0 explained what gives matter its mass. the universe is filled with @entity10 bosons			1
as atoms and parts of atoms zoom around , they interact with and attract @entity10 bosons , which cluster around them in varying numbers			1
certain particles will attract larger clusters of @entity0 , and the more of them a particle attracts , the greater its mass will be			1
the explanation helped complete scientists ' understanding of the nature of all matter			2
" the awarded theory is a central part of the @entity46 of particle physics that describes how the world is constructed , " the @entity18 said in a post on @entity43			1
as is tradition , the academy phoned the scientists during the announcement to inform them of their win			0
they were unable to reach @entity10 , for whom the particle is named			1
the conversation with @entity8 was short and sweet			1
" i feel very well , of course , " he said , when he heard the news			0
" now , i 'm very happy			0
" what is the @entity0 and why is it important ? the discoverers when the @entity4 announcement came down , the @entity0 's discoverers in @entity63 , @entity64 , broke out the champagne , said lead physicist @entity67			1
" the place erupted into applause			0
" there must have been over 100 people in the room at @entity74 , the @entity74 , he said			0
many of them were @entity77 scientists			0
about one quarter of the physicists involved in the discovery came from the @entity77			2
the researchers felt equally recognized alongside the @entity4 recipients			1
they were not expecting to receive the prize themselves			0
that would have been atypical			0
it goes more often to those involved on the theoretical side and not on the experimental side , @entity67 said			0
but it did n't matter			2
" we 're extremely happy with that , " he said			0
we feel that we 've been recognized			0
" the fact that the prize was awarded to the theorists so soon after the particle 's existence was detected by experimenters is a confirmation of the value of their contribution , @entity67 said			1
the discovery the july 2012 discovery of the @entity0 in the most powerful particle accelerator in the world , the @entity105 at @entity74 , has been billed as one of the biggest scientific achievements of the past 50 years			1
but the @entity111 passed over the @entity0 last year , to the surprise of many			1
the scientists , in the meantime , have confirmed their discovery and solidified its place in science			2
on march 14 , what would have been @entity120 's birthday , they announced that , over time , the particle they found looked even more like the @entity10 boson they had been chasing for almost 50 years			1
it was a landmark scientific advancement , and it was a first			2
many scientists dislike the term " @entity2 particle , " even though it 's become popular in the media			2
the nickname came from the title of a book by @entity131 , who reportedly wanted to call it the " @entity133 " since it was so hard to find			0
the @entity4 in physics makes a nice lifetime achievement award for @entity8 and @entity10			1
both are professors emeritus : @entity8 at the @entity138 ; @entity10 at the @entity139 in @entity140			1
though deserving , they are lucky , as the @entity111 had a long list of brilliant scientists and achievements to choose from			2
and the field of physics covers a virtually infinite scale , from beyond the smallest sub-atomic particles to the largest , most distant stars and quasars in the vast reaches of the universe			2
last year 's winners last year 's prize to @entity155 and @entity156 rewarded work in the field of quantum optics			0
it could lead the way to superfast computers and and the most precise clocks ever seen			0
the two approached the same principles from opposite directions			0
the @entity77 used light particles to measure the properties of matter , while his @entity171 colleague focused on tracking light particles by using atoms			2
both @entity4 laureates found ways to isolate the subatomic particles and keep their properties intact at the same time			1
prior to the breakthrough , such particles quickly interacted with matter , which changed their qualities and rendered them unobservable			2
that left scientists stuck doing a lot of guesswork			0
past and future @entity4 since 1901 , the committee has handed out the @entity4 in physics 107 times , including this year 's award			1
the youngest recipient was @entity191 , who won in 1915 at the age of 25			0
@entity191 is not only the youngest physics laureate ; he is also the youngest laureate in any @entity4 area			1
the oldest physics laureate was @entity195 , who was 88 years old when he was awarded the prize in 2002			1
@entity197 was the only physicist to receive the prize twice , for work in semiconductors and superconductivity			0
two @entity77 and a @entity201 shared the @entity4 in physiology or medicine this year			1
@entity77 @entity204 and @entity205 and @entity201 @entity206 were awarded the prize monday for discoveries of how the body 's cells decide when and where to deliver the molecules they produce			0
disruptions of this delivery system contribute to diabetes , neurological diseases and immunological disorders			0
in the coming days , prize committees will announce the laureates in chemistry , literature , peace and economics			0
@entity225 industrialist @entity224 created the prizes in 1895 to honor work in physics , chemistry , literature and peace			0
the first economics prize was awarded in 1969			0
@entity4 medical prize goes to 2 @entity77 , 1 @entity201 follow @ @entity233 on @entity43 for more science news updates			2

@entity8 and @entity10 are awarded the @entity4 in physics
the @entity0 is what gives all matter its mass and is a central part of scientific theory
the july 2012 discovery of the particle is billed as one of the biggest scientific achievements
