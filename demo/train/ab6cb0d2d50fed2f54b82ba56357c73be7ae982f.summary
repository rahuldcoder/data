-- @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3			1
it sounds just like another soiree for those who run international football			0
yet it 's fundamentally different this time for the @entity9 in question is a certain @entity11 , the 55 - year - old who launched his campaign to dethrone @entity3 president @entity14 on monday			1
once one of @entity14 's closest allies following his work as @entity3 's deputy secretary general between 2002 and 2005 , the former diplomat is now eying the top job itself ahead of the presidential elections in june 2015			1
he is the first candidate to throw his hat into the ring , although both @entity14 and @entity26 president @entity25 are also expected to stand -- albeit without declaring their intentions yet			0
adding sparkle and fizz to the opening of @entity9 's campaign was the backing of former @entity34 star @entity2			1
" i can not stay away from a debate which is so important for the future of football and thus , i support @entity1 and his vision , " the 73 - year - old said in a video message			2
@entity2 said that the pair became friends when he was @entity34 's minister of sport and @entity1 was working at the @entity44 in @entity34			1
however , @entity9 -- who worked at @entity3 for 11 years before leaving football 's world governing body in 2010 -- chose @entity48 and the site where the @entity51 , the planet 's oldest , was founded in 1863 to launch his bid			1
image problem in a wide - ranging reform program , the @entity55 outlined his support for greater use of technology in football , a desire to see orange cards and the use of a sinbin to be used between a yellow and red card while also calling for more transparency in the running of @entity3			1
" i have to recognize there is an image problem that we need to reconcile , " @entity1 told @entity0			2
" if we want to tackle the challenges of the game in the 21st century , we need a @entity3 that is more proactive , regulating and democratic -- and that comes with transparency and accountability			2
" campaigning under the banner " @entity80 , @entity81 " , a man who helped @entity14 stand for a successful reelection in 2002 also expressed a desire to redress global imbalances , believing in major disparities in the power of certain leagues , countries and continents			1
" @entity3 is no different to the rest of our society , " he told @entity0 's @entity93 program			1
" we see a growing wealthiest 1 % controlling more of the game , and the middle and less favored classes suffer from that situation			0
@entity99 is a universal vehicle , and that 's why we need to protect it so that it can connect people and nations together			2
" in a move likely to find favor with many football fans around the world , @entity9 also backed an ongoing investigation into how @entity111 won the right to host the @entity113			0
" @entity114 is the largest , most followed sport event in the world			0
we need to go to a @entity113 with total tranquility and serenity , " said a man who is bidding to become the first @entity55 president of @entity3 since @entity119 , the founder of the @entity113 , in the 1950 's			1
" if something ( improper ) has happened , we need to know and if nothing has happened , we need to know as well			0
" the decision has proven highly controversial , especially with the mooted suggestion that the tournament will now be played outside of the traditional months of may - july for the first time in @entity113 history because of the intense heat during the @entity111 summer			0
funding his own campaign , @entity9 needs the support of five national associations to be eligible to stand for election			2
he believes this will be possible because of his consultancy work with a number of @entity51 's around the world since leaving @entity3 in 2010			1
televised debate he may need to work on his campaigning style though , after telling reporters on monday that he was not sure he could beat @entity14 when asked if he could depose the man that has led @entity3 since 1998			2
" no , i do n't think so			0
he is someone of relevance and we 'll see but it 's a very hypothetical question , " he replied			0
" a lot can happen			0
" nonetheless , @entity9 seems as though he will be happy if he can make how the game should be run into a global conversation			0
he wants all the presidential candidates to take part in live televised debates whereby both viewers and fans can ask questions			0
" at the very least i want to open up the debate so these issues are examined properly , " he added			0
should he perhaps surprise even himself and emerge victorious in 2015 , @entity1 would not have to move far -- since he already lives in @entity161 , where @entity3 is based , with his wife and children .			1
