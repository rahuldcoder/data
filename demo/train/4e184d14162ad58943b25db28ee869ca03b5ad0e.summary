-- i always pictured myself graduating from college , getting a cool job and even having a cute little place of my own			1
so far , i have a master 's degree , and i got the coolest job ever as an emergency medicine physician assistant			1
but instead of waking up in a posh apartment , i hear the early - morning sounds of my family dog barking and my parents making coffee downstairs			1
at 27 , i still live with my parents , and i love it			1
despite the bad press my generation of " boomerang millennials " has generated , some of us are happy and even grateful to have a soft place to land after college , even if we 're gainfully employed			1
my decision to live at home was not one of absolute necessity			2
as a physician assistant , i make a good salary and would be able to live on my own comfortably if i needed to do so			2
by the time i finished graduate school , i had amassed a $ 150,000 debt from both undergraduate and graduate tuition			1
with several of these loans earning a 7.9 % interest rate , my father calculated that my loans were increasing by $ 15 a day in interest alone			2
at this rate , it would take me 30 years to pay off my student loans , with much of it going straight to interest			2
i thought of my options : live on my own and pay rent , utilities and food costs , as well as skyrocketing student loans , or move back in with my parents and pay an all - encompassing , smaller monthly rent that would allow me to try and get a jump on my student loans			1
beyond the endless supply of home - cooked meals , the best thing about moving back home is that i am not alone			1
several of my physician assistant friends are in the same boat as i am -- we are all highly educated , white - collar employees who live at home			2
our co-workers in the medical field think it is a great idea because many of them are facing the same gut - wrenching piles of debt			2
they often say if they could do it all again , they would do the same thing			0
with so many millennials moving back in after graduation , the term " boomerang generation " was born			1
about three in 10 adults ages 25 to 34 still live at home , according to a 2012 study by @entity75			1
the number of young adults living at home hit a low in the 1980s , but it 's been on the rise since the recession started in 2007			1
about a quarter of these individuals felt their living situation was bad for their relationship with their parents			2
there 's a stigma that comes along with this arrangement			2
some people might assume that we are mooching off our parents or that we 're too lazy to find a job			1
i do n't think my neighbors understand it , as they continually ask me when i am going to graduate and if i am old enough to babysit their children			0
my mom is quick to dispel any negative comments from people we know though			0
she just tells people that i 'm successful , well - educated and that i save lives			2
millennials are n't saving a dime i love living at home			1
there is a constant supply of coffee and people to pal around with , and i 've been slowly chiseling away at my student loans for the past year			2
now that i 've paid off $ 68,000 of my student loans , those loan payments are n't nearly as nauseating as they used to be			1
i 'll be honest , moving back home did take some getting used to			1
my parents were extremely gracious in opening their home back up to me as i trampled into their empty nest			1
i was not used to having to tell anyone what time i would be home , where i was going and what i was doing			0
i agreed to keep them posted on my whereabouts so they do n't worry if i 'm not home at a certain time			0
as for my parents , they had to get used to me coming home at all hours from the hospital , trying to be quiet while i sleep during the day after working the night shift and putting up with the horrible television shows i like to watch			1
our new relationship is symbiotic			0
my parents benefit from having an extra set of hands around the house to help with chores and a constant source to explain all pop - culture references			0
in terms of romance , i am 27 , and my boyfriend is 33			0
he is not allowed upstairs and has to sleep on the couch if he stays over			0
thankfully , he is understanding and has a place of his own			0
i spend a couple of nights a week hanging out at his place			0
as it stands right now , i say that i am going to move out next year			0
but honestly , i have no reason to do so			0
moving out on my own would mean that i would have to cook for myself , clean my place and go grocery shopping			0
i know that i can live on my own if i need to , but right now i do n't want to			0
i am fortunate to have such loving parents , and i understand that not everyone is lucky enough to be in this same situation			0
thankfully , my parents have not told me i need to move out by a certain point			0
if i stay here long enough , i might get to the point where i start telling people that my parents live with me			0
but as it stands right now , i live with them , and society should be ok with that			0
