@entity0 -- immigration reform entered an uncertain new phase on wednesday as @entity4 signaled some willingness to compromise with president @entity6 and @entity7 but rejected a @entity9 - passed bill and insisted they would take their time drafting their own version			1
following more than two hours of talks on how to proceed , @entity13 legislators said the biggest question was whether to give the 11 million immigrants living illegally in the @entity17 a path to eventual citizenship , as provided by the @entity9 measure			1
participants in the @entity13 caucus meeting described a 50 - 50 split over the undocumented immigrant issue , with more consensus on the need to produce some kind of legislation to show the party 's commitment to fixing a broken system and addressing concerns of @entity33 -- the nation 's largest minority demographic			2
despite the divisions on the undocumented immigrant issue , @entity37 majority leader @entity36 of @entity38 told the @entity13 members that children living illegally in the @entity17 through no fault to their own should receive legal status			1
@entity46 chairman @entity45 said he and fellow @entity47 were working together on a bill focused on children , which is a priority of @entity7 pushing for immigration reform			0
at the same time , @entity37 @entity13 leaders made clear they intended to slow the process down by tackling individual components of the broad measure passed by the @entity7 - led @entity9 last month with bipartisan support			1
@entity56 welcomes new citizens in soft push for immigration reform prospect of political attacks that means taking up smaller bills on specific provisions , such as border security and employment verification measures , in coming months while also seeking a compromise within the caucus on providing legal status for undocumented immigrants			1
house speaker @entity69 warned his caucus that @entity13 would face political attacks if they failed to move legislation , according to several @entity13 sources in the room			2
" we do n't want the @entity37 to hope that we fail to make it a campaign issue , " said @entity13 rep. @entity75 of @entity76			1
" @entity4 want to do this on our terms , and not on the @entity9 's terms and not on the @entity37 terms			2
" another prominent @entity37 @entity13 leader , @entity84 chairman rep. @entity83 of @entity85 , told his colleagues that doing nothing was not an option			1
the unsuccessful @entity13 vice presidential nominee in last year 's election , @entity83 made the case also pushed by the @entity37 that immigration reform would help boost the @entity17 economy , participants said			1
meanwhile , a group of bipartisan @entity37 legislators trying to draft its own immigration measure met for several hours on tuesday night and would continue its work , said @entity7 rep. @entity99 of @entity100			1
the group is working on a comprehensive bill closer in form to the @entity9 measure and @entity99 argued the incremental approach advocated by @entity4 would n't work			2
" it 's better to eat your wheaties and do it right than do it poorly and 5 - 10 years from now have to come back at it again , " @entity99 said			0
how immigration reform would affect 3 families path to legal status the 1,000 - plus page @entity9 immigration bill passed last month takes a comprehensive approach that removes the threat of immediate deportation for most undocumented immigrants and provides a path to legal status and eventual citizenship			1
it also includes stronger enforcement provisions including the virtual militarization of the @entity127 border with almost double the agents , new technology and a longer fence , as well as requiring employers to verify the immigration status of workers and improved monitoring of visa holders			0
while the @entity9 measure passed 68 - 32 with support from 14 republicans , @entity37 @entity13 leaders insist they will not bring it up because most of their caucus opposes it			1
@entity69 has repeatedly said any immigration bill brought up for a @entity37 vote must have support from a majority of @entity13 , and he repeated that guarantee to his @entity13 caucus on wednesday			1
@entity7 called on @entity69 to allow a @entity37 vote on the @entity9 version , believing it could pass with unified @entity7 support along with several dozen @entity13			1
rep. @entity152 of @entity153 , the no. 2 @entity154 in the @entity37 , said wednesday that @entity13 were " splintered and confused " on immigration , describing what he called a " deeply divided party " that was " much more into ideology than they are into solving problems			2
" opinion : should the @entity17 be more like @entity127 ? midterms loom in 2014 the immigration issue will be significant in next year 's congressional elections , with @entity4 under pressure from conservatives to oppose what the political right - wing calls amnesty in the form of a path to legal status and even citizenship for people who sneaked into the country illegally or overstayed their visas			1
" once you start down that line , you 're destroying the rule of law , " conservative @entity13 rep. @entity177 of @entity178 said after wednesday 's caucus meeting			0
he and fellow conservative rep. @entity183 of @entity184 described the @entity13 caucus as evenly divided on the question			0
" the real issue is amnesty			0
the whole game is about legalization , the status of legalization , " @entity183 said			0
on the other side was rep. @entity193 , a @entity194 immigrant from @entity195 , who told reporters that " we have different points of view			0
" " i hope we can also look at the 11 million people who want to legalize their status , " she added			0
for @entity6 and @entity7 , passage of immigration reform would mean following through on a promise to the nation 's largest minority demographic -- @entity33 @entity33 -- to reduce uncertainty for millions of them living illegally in the @entity17			0
searching for the @entity209 in @entity127 moderate republicans , including most of the party 's leaders in @entity213 , want a compromise that would represent a potential breakthrough for the @entity13 with @entity33 who voted overwhelmingly for @entity6 in last year 's election			2
earlier wednesday , former president @entity56 added his voice to calls for a solution , telling a ceremony for new citizens that the present system was broken			1
" i do hope there is a positive resolution to the debate , " @entity56 said in a rare public comment about politics since he left office			2
while he refrained from taking sides , he sounded moderate in saying he hoped that " we keep a benevolent spirit in mind			0
" " we understand the contributions immigrants make to our country , " said @entity56 , a @entity13			2
" we must remember that the vast majority of immigrants are decent people who work hard and support their families and practice their faith and lead responsible lives			0
" @entity37 keeps up pressure however , conservatives fear that legalizing undocumented immigrants means guaranteeing future electoral hardship for @entity13 by adding millions of new voters who generally lean @entity7			1
the @entity37 sought to keep up pressure on @entity4 , asserting wednesday that the @entity9 immigration measure would boost the @entity17 economy and help create jobs			2
a @entity252 report released in june indicated the @entity9 bill could reduce deficits by $ 175 billion over the first 10 years and by at least $ 700 billion in the second decade			0
the @entity252 , working with the congressional @entity255 , estimated that eight million unauthorized residents would become legal in the first decade			0
in addition , the @entity252 report estimated the bill would boost the @entity17 population by a net of 10.4 million people by 2023 and by 16 million by 2033			0
" the benefits are clear			0
the fact that there is a broad bipartisan consensus behind this is clear , " @entity37 spokesman @entity264 said wednesday			0
" it can not be acceptable , broadly and in the long term , that immigration reform would be blocked because some minority of @entity4 is concerned about a primary challenge from the far right			0
that 's not a good argument			0
it 's not a good argument politically			0
it 's certainly not a good argument economically , " he said			0
@entity9 immigration deal includes tougher border security ' fully comprehensive ' on the @entity37 side , the bipartisan group working on an immigration package would require that border security measures be in place before any process toward residency for undocumented immigrants could begin			1
@entity13 legislators endorsed that strategy after wednesday 's caucus meeting			2
" the @entity17 people want our border secured , our laws enforced , and the problems in our immigration system fixed to strengthen our economy , " said a joint statement by @entity37 @entity13 leaders that expressed distrust in @entity6 and @entity7 to fully enact tougher security laws before legalizing undocumented immigrants			1
@entity13 @entity304 rep. @entity304 of @entity100 told reporters the end result in the @entity37 would be " fully comprehensive immigration reform " that would address undocumented immigrants			1
he outlined legislation that would provide some with legal status , such as those who served in the military and children of undocumented immigrants brought into the country illegally by their parents			1
while other immigrants also could be considered for legal status , those with criminal records should be kicked out , @entity304 said			2
sticking points in the @entity37 debate include whether undocumented immigrants would be eligible for health care benefits during the years it would take to get legal status , and empowering state and local police to work with federal authorities in enforcing immigration laws			1
opinion : on immigration , @entity13 offers fear , not ideas @entity1 's @entity331 , @entity332 , @entity333 , @entity334 and @entity336 's @entity335 contributed to this report .			0
