@entity0 -- @entity2 is one of the few outsiders who has seen firsthand how people live in the @entity6 countryside , and he describes a population " lethargic " from malnutrition			1
just two weeks ago , he visited an orphanage as part of his work as the @entity6 program director for the relief organization @entity13			2
he said the last protein children had eaten was in january -- eggs			0
" that tells us not only are they not getting a balanced diet but in terms of the rations , they 're getting only about 60 % of what a child needs , " he said			0
@entity2 describes widespread severe malnourishment and " an entire generation " that is " stunted physically , developmentally because of chronic malnutrition			1
" no sign of @entity6 rocket launch according to @entity2 , in seven visits since 2007 , he has been to dozens of orphanages and hospitals and more than 19 private homes			1
he says he is troubled that the @entity34 plans to call off a massive shipment of food aid as a result of the anticipated rocket launch by @entity6 between now and monday			1
@entity39 insists that the rocket is necessary to put a weather satellite in orbit , but @entity0 and @entity43 consider it a ballistic missile test in disguise			0
such launches by @entity6 breach @entity48 resolutions			0
under a recent food deal with the @entity34 , @entity6 agreed to refrain from long range missile launches and nuclear tests			1
in exchange , the @entity34 would provide what @entity2 described as a year 's worth of corn - soy porridge mixed with vegetable oil for children younger than 10 and pregnant women			1
the food " would n't taste delicious but it saves lives , " @entity2 said , noting that it would have helped 2.4 million people			0
at the @entity66 , president @entity65 's aides suggest their hands are tied after @entity39 announced the launch just weeks after the food deal was agreed			1
the @entity6 ' " blatant disregard for their commitments makes it impossible for the @entity34 to provide the nutritional assistance that it had hoped to provide for the @entity6 people , " said @entity70 , the @entity66 press secretary			1
some observers have doubts about the @entity66 's approach			1
" i have real questions about whether we should have linked humanitarian food assistance to the nuclear missile program in the first place , " said @entity80 , who was senior director for @entity82 affairs at the @entity83 during the @entity85 administration			2
" it is not the fault of the average @entity6 who needs the food , who is at starvation level , that the regime is developing nuclear missiles			2
" he said the threatened missile launch was a " provocation that should have been predictable			0
" but @entity80 acknowledged that if the @entity6 flaunt the deal , sending the food " would be a political liability for the administration at home , and it would look weak internationally			2
" @entity107 was careful not to criticize the @entity65 administration			0
but he did say the administration had previously made it clear it would send food to @entity6 if there was a verified need for that aid			1
" we know there is a need and we know we can met the need			0
as a humanitarian organization we are saying there is an opportunity to do that , " @entity2 said			0
" i do n't want to assign blame			0
but i 'm saying there is an opportunity to engage positively and constructively with a group of people the @entity66 describes as innocent and starving , and we can do that			2
