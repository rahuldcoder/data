-- some 518 days after she first set off alone in her sailboat , 16 - year - old @entity1 glided into a @entity4 port on saturday to complete her historic , and controversial , voyage around the globe			1
the @entity9 citizen arrived in @entity10 around 3 p.m. ( 2 p.m. et ) , her spokesman @entity7 told @entity0			2
and a picture linked from @entity1 's official website saturday shows her standing behind a group of children holding a sign , " congratulations @entity1 ... welcome back to @entity10			1
" while other teens have made similar sea voyages -- some of them without stopping , as @entity1 did -- the @entity9 girl unofficially appears to be the youngest to do so sailing alone			1
in 2010 , @entity21 @entity20 finished a non-stop , unassisted solo circumnavigation days before her 17th birthday			0
but sailing journalists have said , and her team did n't dispute , that her route was less than 21,600 orthodromic ( or , in the same direction for a great circle ) nautical miles , which is the length of the equator and the distance generally used for round - the - world sailing records			2
@entity1 states on her website that she traversed about 27,000 nautical miles on her own solo voyage aboard her 38 - foot yacht , which she has dubbed @entity35			1
she was 14 when she began august 21 , 2010 , in @entity36 and then headed west across the @entity37 , through the @entity38 , across the @entity39 , through the @entity40 , around the @entity41 , and ultimately to her final destination in the @entity4			0
the trip almost did n't happen -- not because of problems at sea , but rather due to a high - profile legal fight by @entity9 authorities to prevent the teen from setting sail , for her own safety			1
14 - year - old attempts world record in august 2009 , @entity1 was put under state care for two months , following her parents ' refusal to prevent her from undertaking the voyage			2
then , in october 2009 , a @entity9 court ruled the girl could n't sail around the world because she was not considered experienced enough to do so			1
but it left the door open for a future trip , deciding that she could depart if she fulfilled certain requirements the court had established for her			0
" as a 13 - year - old girl , it was never my intention to be the center of world news , " @entity1 wrote on her blog three days before docking in @entity10			1
" now , after sailing around the world , with difficult port approaches , storms , dangerous reefs , and the full responsibility of keeping myself and the @entity35 safe , i feel that the nightmares the @entity9 government organizations put me through , were totally unfair , " she added			2
16 - year - old circumnavigates the globe @entity1 made stops in numerous coastal sites during her trip , in places such as the @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 , @entity85			0
according to multiple published reports , including in the @entity10 newspaper today , she had once planned to return to @entity36 by going through the @entity88 , but altered her route and headed around @entity85 toward @entity10 to avoid pirates			0
the day before docking for the last time , she reflected on the early days of her voyage , including her initial time in the @entity4 more than a year earlier			0
" it feels like it was just yesterday but at the same time it seems like it was an eternity ago , " wrote @entity1 , who was actually born on a boat in port in @entity95			2
" back then i had no idea i would be back now with a life load of new experiences and 27,000 nautical miles under @entity35 's keel			1
" but here i am having almost circumnavigated the whole world			0
yes , that idea is slowly sinking in ... but i do n't really believe it			0
" @entity0 's @entity108 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 was at sea or in port for 518 days , her website states
she traversed 27,000 nautical miles before docking in @entity10
the teen fought efforts by @entity9 authorities who did n't want her to sail
