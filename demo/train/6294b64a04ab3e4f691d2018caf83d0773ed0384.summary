-- in just 12 years leading up to 2010 , @entity1 cut the country 's malnutrition rate in half by investing in small scale farming			1
poverty in the country has plummeted from 58 percent in 1993 to 18 percent by 2006 , says development charity @entity8 , who cites the @entity12 country as a exceptional model for others around the world			2
@entity1 went from being a rice importer to the second biggest exporter of rice in the world			1
" the magic formula is political will and vision , " says @entity21 , head of economic justice policy at @entity23 " planning a government strategy and making sure the investment gets to those who need it most is the key , " she says			0
smallholder farming , a term used for small scale or family farming , is in fact the best way to describe 500 million farms globally where two billion people live and work			1
the term includes a wide range of producers from the most marginal and impoverished to those working in markets at a local , national or international level			0
very often these farmers are women who must work to provide the food for their families			2
@entity8 is a staunch believer that smallholder farming is the way forward			2
" all evidence in small scale farming , family farming on small plots of land , show it is one of the surest ways to relieve poverty , " says @entity21			1
fair trade success in @entity63 , one of @entity66 's poorest countries , thousands of farmers are now part of the @entity70 ( @entity69 ) group , farming mainly tea , coffee , sugar and ground nuts			1
" @entity63 is the first of its kind in @entity66 to have a fair trade network , and there is a lot of interest in how we are doing it , " says @entity75 , network coordinator for the @entity76			0
in the last 18 months , many have seen their hardships turn into success , says @entity75 , who serves as the liaison between many farmers and the @entity69			2
watch : planting a million trees a year to tackle deforestation @entity63 already has 30,000 farmers involved in fair trade farming methods , plus another 20,000 working on these farms			1
" when we talk about smallholder farmers , we are talking about the farmer who owns one to five acres of land , using rudimentary means of farming , who is not able to easily access finance , " says @entity75			1
" the majority of the farmers in @entity63 today are smallholder farmers			2
" indeed , says one @entity63 farmer , @entity106 , whose small tea farm now has a bridge to help her get between her home and the tea field during the rainy season			2
" the fair trade premium bought an ambulance which serves my family and relatives when we are sick			0
before that we used to carry a very sick patient many kilometers before reaching the hospital , " says @entity106			0
schools , electricity , irrigation , and much more has been put in place in @entity63 due to the success of the cooperative - style network			0
a further bonus is many of the farmers then find themselves able to diversify into businesses			2
in southern @entity133 , @entity129 , director and founder of the @entity132 , decided to take matters in her own hands after she was tired of watching local farmers suffer waiting for food aid during @entity133 's civil war			1
she has set up her group to help farmers with supplies and the skills needed			1
" there is enough land in @entity133 and it is really fertile , it just needs work			0
what we need and want is for people to grow their own food , not to depend on @entity153 and @entity154 , " she says			0
as @entity129 has proved , the importance of smallholder farmers is even more important in times of political strife			1
@entity159 in @entity164 , the @entity162 ( @entity163 ) , a cooperative of 2,000 farmers started in 2010 , has established tree nurseries planting one million trees a year in a country which has lost 98 percent of its trees to deforestation			1
the @entity163 provides high quality seeds , tools and training , and has already helped the farmers increase their yields by 40 - 50 percent			2
one @entity164 farmer said the @entity163 has helped her turn her life around , especially since recent hurricanes ruined her crops			1
" my life situation is better , " said @entity179			0
" i have enough food to feed my kids and the sell the remaining food at the market			0
i now have a dream and i know how to protect my dreams , " she said			0
@entity179 says thanks to a flat interest rate loan from the @entity163 , she was able to restart her business , purchase new livestock and save money			0
smallholder farming spells big business from the economic side , opportunities for smallholder farmers are exponential			1
" there 's a huge opportunity for smallholders to sell to big businesses , " says @entity198 , head of policy and research at @entity201			0
" the risks are that you can get locked into a big supplier who holds the power and pushes your prices down , " said @entity198 , who added that recent controversy at the @entity208 meetings in june addressed how to empower the smallholders so they do n't end up stuck in unhelpful relationships with multinational corporations			0
the @entity218 has declared 2014 the @entity219 with the aim to support and recognize the importance of smallholder farming			1
by doing so , the @entity218 says it will help eradicate hunger , reduce rural poverty and reach food security through sustainable production			1
while the scale of investment of what 's needed has n't yet happened , @entity8 says there are glimmers of hope out there with farmers learning about the market system , how to improve their yields , form cooperatives , and access credit safely			1
" there 's all kinds of brilliant stuff that 's going on but it needs to be scaled up , " says @entity8 's @entity21			0
once that happens , she says " the poorest people will start benefiting from their labor			0
