" surviving is very difficult on a daily basis , " @entity1 , founder and president of the @entity24 party , had told earlier the crowd of analysts , activists and members of the diaspora gathered at @entity31 's @entity30 ( @entity30 )			1
unemployment is soaring , he said , and acute food shortages threaten vulnerable parts of the population with starvation			0
schools are short of books and hospitals often lack the most basic supplies -- just a few days ago , he said , a hospital in @entity44 was left without running water			0
" this is why all our leaders when they 're falling ill they leave the country and go for treatment in @entity52 , in @entity53 , in @entity54 , in the @entity11 and the rest of us must die , " he said			0

but also in august , a survey by @entity150 described a different picture , giving @entity59 32 % and @entity107 31 %			0
