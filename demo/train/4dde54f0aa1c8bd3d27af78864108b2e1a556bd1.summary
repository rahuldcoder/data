-- although a massive earthquake destroyed her home and her office in january 2010 , @entity1 has been relentless in her efforts to support rape victims in @entity7			1
@entity1 is a rape survivor herself			2
in 2004 , she established @entity9 , an organization that helps other survivors find safety , medical care and legal aid			2
since the earthquake , she and her group have helped more than 1,400 women			2
@entity0 asked @entity1 for her thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 @entity19 of 2012			1
@entity0 : what do you hope this recognition will mean for @entity9 ? @entity1 : it 's an opportunity for people to know the situation in @entity7 -- for women , especially			1
we feel that ( this ) will allow @entity9 to reach out to more women and provide more support			2
@entity7 is a country where many of the women are victims			1
for me , this is a huge thing			0
i was raped in 1992 and in 2003 ; i survived an attempted rape in 2010			1
and yet in the face of the problems in our country , i gave my entire life for this project			0
this will enable me to continue to fight , and i hope it brings about a change for my country			0
@entity0 : what was your reaction when you found out that you 'd been selected as a top 10 @entity19 ? @entity1 : i knew it was something special			1
when we found out , all the victims mobilized , and it was a victory for them			2
this gives encouragement to me and our outreach agents to continue to serve other women and girls who are victims			2
more from @entity19 : living in fear " under the tent " @entity0 : how will you use the $ 50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a top 10 @entity19 ? @entity1 : we will use a portion of it so we can help the children			1
we have a lot of children that we are helping in education			0
( an ) organization that was sponsoring a school could no longer pay to keep up the school			0
we would take the children we are working with already and work on finding a school that they can attend			0
the money will give us the opportunity to help the children not lose a full year and get an education			0
when children do n't have an education , it becomes a problem for everyone			0
secondly , ( it will ) help in hiring security guards , for improving security for those involved with @entity9			0
@entity0 : what do you want people to know most about your work ? @entity1 : there is too much violence in @entity7			1
i want people in the @entity99 to know the work that @entity9 is doing to combat corruption			0
we are fighting for the women and children who , after the earthquake , became victims			1
we are fighting for justice			0
