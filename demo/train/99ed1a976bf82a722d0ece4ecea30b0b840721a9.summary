-- @entity1 , a professional motivational speaker who has flown nearly half a million miles , is no stranger to airline trouble			1
even the most savvy of business travelers , like @entity5 , are not spared inconveniences due to delays , cancellations and mechanical failure			1
but @entity1 experienced something new last month			1
for the first time in his 20 - year career , he said , he was ordered off a plane that had been cleared for takeoff for what could be called his own mechanical failure			1
@entity5 is wheelchair - bound because of cerebral palsy , a condition he has managed to turn into a source of inspiration for the national audiences he addresses regularly			1
" my first reaction was to worry about my family 's safety , " @entity1 said about the request for him to get off the plane			1
" i 've got kids , my father 's 78 years old and not in good health ; i thought , ' they 're going to tell me something i do n't want to hear ' " they did , but it was of a different sort : he was told he was removed from the plane because of his physical condition			1
" their argument was if something were to happen , i ca n't help myself or somebody else , which is an assumption first of all			0
second of all , the people that made the decision are not medical doctors , " said @entity1 , 47 , of @entity44 , @entity45			1
" they basically told me i was too disabled to fly and i had to fly with a companion and i had to purchase that companion 's ticket , " he told @entity55 's " @entity54			2
" the airline , @entity56 , said he was ordered off the flight for his own safety			0
" he did not appear to have the ability to assist himself in evacuating in the event of an emergency , " said @entity59 , a @entity56 spokeswoman			0
" he appeared to have a lot of difficulty moving			0
" @entity1 had been on a @entity56 flight from @entity66 , @entity67 , to @entity68 , @entity69 , where he had a late - september speaking engagement			1
@entity1 said he had looked into what legal courses were available to him			1
the @entity73 outlines how airlines should deal with people with disabilities , but it is unclear whether @entity56 ' actions violated the act 's provisions			2
but afterwards , he told " @entity54 " that he would not sue			0
instead , he said , he would prefer to approach the matter from a civil rights standpoint			0
" it 's against the law to stop me from traveling for a specific reason , and if i 'm already on the plane , they violated my civil rights			2
it 's like telling @entity90 you ca n't sit on the bus , " @entity1 said			1
" i 'm not angry			0
i was just embarrassed because i could n't do my job			0
" @entity56 ' official policy on disabled passengers stipulates that " for safety - related reasons , if a passenger has a mobility impairment so severe that the person is unable to physically assist in his or her own evacuation of the aircraft , the airline requires that the passenger travel with a safety assistant to assist the passenger to exit the aircraft in case of an emergency evacuation , " @entity59 said			2
" safety is our number one priority and we did not feel it was safe for mr. @entity1 to fly that day , " she said			1
@entity1 said that , after he was escorted off the flight , he booked a seat on @entity115 and had no problems traveling alone on that flight			1
the airline did not contact him until nearly three weeks later , @entity1 contends , after stories began to emerge about the incident			1
its only offer at that time , he said , was to reimburse him for the flight			0
but friday , as the story spread to more media outlets , @entity59 said @entity56 ' " customer relations team had an extremely productive discussion " with @entity5			2
" we asked mr. @entity1 if he might be interested in working with us as a sounding board to help us continue to work toward improving our service for our customers with disabilities , " she said			2
@entity1 confirmed they had " a very productive talk			2
" " they do want to right this wrong and they do want to work with me , " he said			0
" and i am hopeful -- do n't want to sound cynical but it is a big company -- i am hopeful we can come up with a solution that wo n't only work for the two of us but will make sure that this does n't happen to anyone with a disability in the future			0
" @entity143 , who is on the board of trustees of @entity145 and also has the disease , did n't see the incident as one of negligence or an intent to discriminate on the part of @entity56			0
he attributed @entity1 's experience to a lack of training and a lack of clarity about policies and how they 're applied to disabled travelers			1
" there 's a general lack of understanding of disability amongst the entire travel industry , and i think that 's simply because they look at it as a compliance issue , rather than a customer - service issue , " said @entity143 , who is the chief investment officer of @entity160			0
@entity1 said he wants to make sure this does n't happen to other disabled passengers			1
" i do n't want a little boy with a disability not have the opportunity to go somewhere			0
i do n't want a young girl with a disability going out for her first job interview by herself to be told she ca n't fly in an airplane , " @entity1 said			2
@entity143 said he hopes this incident will serve as a learning experience for airlines and make customer service better			0
" i think some dialogue and some handwringing and some getting down into the weeds here is what needs to happen so that this stuff does n't occur again , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity190 and @entity191 contributed to this report .			0
