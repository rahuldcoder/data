-- @entity3 's 218 public schools may not open on time in september unless the district receives $ 50 million from the city by friday , superintendent @entity1 says			1
@entity1 gave the city the ultimatum after the layoff of close to 3,800 employees this summer due to a " drastic financial shortfall			1
" the massive layoffs included aides , assistant principals , social workers and arts teachers			0
if the city does n't pay up by friday , @entity1 says , the district may not be able to open all 218 schools for a full - day program on september 9			1
" without the funds to restore crucial staff members , we can not open functional schools , run them responsibly or provide a quality education to students , " @entity1 said			2
mayor @entity26 called it one of " the most chilling " statements he had ever heard a superintendent make , but he said stands " shoulder to shoulder " with @entity1 and will not allow schools to open with the staff that he can currently afford			1
@entity1 and @entity26 have urged the @entity33 to extend a 1 % sales tax to make up the difference but -- despite approval from the @entity37 and @entity39 gov. @entity38 -- city council president @entity40 says he would rather focus those funds on the city 's critical pension problem			0
if the city does not solve the retirement fund issues , @entity40 said , @entity3 could quickly follow in the footsteps of other major cities with significant financial problems			2
as an alternative , @entity40 proposed the city purchase the school district 's surplus vacant real estate for $ 50 million and sell the property to developers who could turn it into potential job producers			1
@entity1 does not believe that will bring the district closer to financial stability , according to @entity60 , spokesman for the school district			0
@entity1 and @entity26 are also negotiating a contract with the local teachers ' union , hoping to save money by asking teachers to make concessions on certain benefits			0
because there has been no agreement with the union , $ 45 million in aid from the state previously allocated to the school district is being withheld			2
once the negotiations are complete the funding will be released , budget secretary @entity75 said tuesday			0
with @entity1 's friday deadline looming , mayor @entity26 said he believes opening the school district without the necessary funding would be " irresponsible			1
" " we have what we have and we fight another day to get more , " @entity26 said .			0
