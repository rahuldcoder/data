as soon as monday , travelers nationwide could face flight delays because of the federal spending cuts , with delays averaging 10 , 20 , and 30 minutes at major hub airports during peak periods , but soaring on days when controller furloughs force airports to shut down runways			1
in those infrequent circumstances , delays could exceed an hour at @entity14 and hit three - and - a - half hours at @entity16 's @entity16 airport , top federal transportation officials warned			1
airlines ask court to block @entity20 furloughs and those delays , long as they are , could grow longer if compounded by bad weather or equipment failures , officials said			1
a dour secretary of transportation @entity25 and his @entity20 chief , @entity27 , briefed the airlines on tuesday and reporters on thursday , saying the public needs to be informed about the impending impacts of the forced spending cuts , known as the sequester			1
the @entity34 needs to cut $ 1 billion from its budget , with some $ 637 million of that coming from the @entity20 's $ 16 billion budget			0
congressional republicans say the @entity34 could have chosen less harmful cuts			0
but @entity25 , himself a @entity41 , says there 's no way to cut $ 1 billion without impacting services			1
" we have done everything ( possible ) to find a billion dollars , and if we had our way we probably would n't be sitting here , " @entity25 said			1
" this is very painful			1
this is not what we signed up for			0
this is a dumb idea			1
@entity53 is a dumb idea			1
not one person in @entity56 would use the sequester to figure out their budget			1
it 's a meat - ax approach			0
" @entity25 and @entity27 said impacts will reduce the efficiency of the system , but will not imperil passengers ' safety			1
" i want to make it abundantly clear , we will not take a backseat to safety during sequestration , " added @entity25			1
furlough notices have been sent to the @entity34 's 55,000 employees , telling them that they will be placed on unpaid leave for 11 days by september 30 , the end of the fiscal year			0
all employees face furloughs , including the 47,000 @entity20 employees , many of whom are air traffic controllers			1
" we can not avoid furloughs , " @entity25 said			1
@entity27 said the nation 's large hub airports face " heavy to moderate " delays , and delays are likely to ripple to other airports			1
the impact is uneven at the hub airports because of differing traffic volumes and configurations , he said			1
airports can have intersecting or non-intersecting runways , single or multiple control towers , and varying technology			1
furloughs will be managed at the airport facility level , @entity25 said			1
in an effort to predict the impact , the @entity20 studied actual airport traffic at 13 major airports on march 29 , a clear weather friday			1
mondays and fridays traditionally are the busiest air travel days			0
the @entity20 looked at the actual traffic and the rate at which it can accept aircraft and calculated the impact of fewer controllers			1
the @entity20 said its study showed a " wide range of impacts , " and it predicted " average delays " and " maximum delays " at six airports it considers illustrative : @entity117 's @entity116 : average delay : 20.5 minutes			1
maximum delay : 51 minutes			1
the @entity20 said peak air traffic already exceeds the airport 's capacity			0
a reduced staffing could lead to ground delays , which is a hold on traffic at the originating airport until the load is reduced			1
@entity129 's @entity128 : average delay : 12 minutes			2
maximum delay : 50 minutes			2
the @entity20 expects it will have to introduce ground - delay programs to meet afternoon demand on busy days			0
@entity129 's @entity132 : average delay : 30.5 minutes			2
maximum delay : 80 minutes			2
the airport 's small , compact size contributes to difficulties storing planes on the ground , @entity27 said			0
@entity138 : average delay : 50.4 minutes			2
maximum delay : 132 minutes			2
furloughs will lead @entity138 to occasionally shutter one of its two control towers , closing one runway and reducing takeoffs and landings			0
@entity14 : average delay : 10.1 minutes			2
maximum delay : 67 minutes			2
@entity146 : average delay : 11.3 minutes			2
maximum delay : 210 minutes			2
safety limitations could create situations where the @entity20 would not be able to use all of the airport 's five parallel runways			0
the @entity20 said it plans to release predictions for seven other airports : @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159			2
@entity25 said the @entity20 shared the information with airlines on tuesday			1
the officials called the maximum delays " an estimate ... a forecast			1
" of the most extreme delays , @entity27 said , " we think they will be infrequent			2
" @entity168 came from all directions thursday			0
@entity170 , which represents major @entity56 airlines , said it is reviewing legal options to prevent the furloughs			2
" we have consistently said -- and we have three , third - party legal opinions affirming -- that the @entity20 has the discretion to implement cuts without furloughing air traffic controllers , " said spokeswoman @entity174			0
sen. @entity180 , @entity181 , said " savings can and should be found elsewhere			0
" " i am baffled by the administration 's continued insistence on putting its top - line message -- that we ca n't cut a dime without severe consequences -- before the safety and well - being of @entity56			0
" sen. @entity191 , @entity192 , blamed @entity41 for " refusing to work " for a budget compromise and slammed the @entity20 for not doing more to warn the public			0
" i am deeply disappointed that the agency has failed to inform the public on how dramatically their travel plans will be impacted in the days and weeks ahead , " he said			0
" the @entity20 immediately needs to do substantially more to explain the impact of sequestration on the traveling public			0
" industry groups said the impact of furloughs would be far - reaching			0
" for the airlines , it means significant cuts in capacity and major financial losses , " said the @entity203			0
" for pilots , it could span from challenges getting to work to losing their jobs			0
for passengers , it could mean a lot of time waiting in airports and not making it to their destinations on time			0
" a group representing airports thursday also warned that the @entity20 furloughs could impact passengers			0
@entity225 said it is " standing ready to assist passengers whose travel plans are disrupted by sequestration - related furloughs			0
" the @entity20 also plans to close control towers at 149 small - to medium - sized airports on june 15			0
it postponed plans to close the airports beginning april 7 to give airports a chance to find alternate sources of funds for the towers .			0

transportation officials say travelers will wait , and wait , and wait out effects of sequester
" this is very painful ... @entity53 is a dumb idea , " says secretary @entity25
delays could run from minutes into hours at major airports with fewer controllers
weather problems could make delays even longer
