-- @entity1 was a mesmerizing presence on the pitch during four @entity5 finals as a player			1
when he returned to football 's biggest stage in 2010 as coach of @entity11 , it soon became clear that his capacity to entertain remained undimmed			1
his theatrical displays from the touchline during @entity11 's matches became one of the unexpected highlights of the tournament			1
@entity19 , senior staff photographer at @entity20 , had a ringside seat as @entity1 took charge for his first competitive @entity5 finals match against @entity24 at @entity26 's @entity25			1
" you just know that this was going to be a worldwide story , " @entity19 told @entity0 's @entity28 series			1
" i decided to try and sit as close to the dugout as i could get away with -- just to get a portrait or a reaction shot			0
i wanted to get in , get that feeling of what it 's like to be part of that bench when and if @entity11 scored			1
" it 's quite a careful balancing act taking photos in these situations , " adds @entity19			1
" you do n't want to get too close and start upsetting someone			0
" but @entity1 did n't seem to care			2
i do n't think he even noticed i was there			0
" when @entity46 's diving header had the net bulging in the sixth minute , @entity19 took his chance			1
" obviously , there 's a huge element of luck involved in it , " the photographer concedes , pointing to the substitute on the left of the photo who jumped out of the dugout when he celebrated			2
" i 'm glad he did it there and not bang in front of @entity1 or i would have missed the picture			2
" it 's an iconic image , he thinks -- one that brings @entity1 's @entity5 story up to date			1
" he 's a man that practically won it single - handedly for @entity11 back in 1986 ( in @entity73 ) and then was banned , " @entity19 says referring to @entity1 's ignominious exit from the 1994 @entity69 tournament after testing positive for the banned stimulant ephedrine			1
" for him to them come back as coach for the @entity77 team -- the whole world wants to know what 's going to happen			0
" @entity1 's last finals as a player in 1994 was also the scene of @entity19 's debut as a @entity5 photographer			1
back then he was still using film , sending reels back to the office for processing with pictures ready for clients usually within a couple of hours			0
" in @entity92 , i 'll be sending pictures instantly to the editors within a second of it actually happening , " says @entity19			2
" it will be edited and cropped and captioned and then beamed to the world so people have it in two minutes			0
" technology has n't just helped make sports photography become more efficient , it 's also helped it evolve			0
" you 're constantly under pressure because it 's a competitive industry , " adds @entity19			1
" there might be upwards of 200 photographers on the pitch and people are just looking for the absolute best image of a particular incident			0
" @entity19 , 52 , has thrived in that cutthroat environment , and came up trumps a second time in @entity114 when he captured the moment @entity118 @entity117 's right boot violently connected with @entity121 midfielder @entity120 's chest			1
" it was a very feisty final			0
it happened very quickly , out of the blue , so i was just fortunate that i was in the right position to get the kung fu kick			1
" sitting on the touchline level with the 18 - yard line , @entity19 took the shot using his 400 mm lens			2
" because it was a night game under floodlights you 're shooting wide open -- a very large aperture -- so the depth of field on these images is very small , maybe about six inches			0
" but it 's good because it throws the background out ( of focus ) completely and isolates the players very well			0
i must have shot it at about 1/1,000th of a second			0
" @entity145 escaped with a booking -- one of 14 in the match -- but the tackle became perhaps the defining image of the final which @entity152 went onto win 1 - 0 after extra time			2
" it 's quite an iconic image from a @entity5 final -- they do n't come around very often , " @entity19 says			1
" there 's a large element of luck involved -- being in the right place at the right time -- but you still have to get the image			2
" @entity19 experience extends across the sporting spectrum with a portfolio that includes six @entity168 , four cricket @entity169 , four @entity171 and two round the world yacht races to his name			0
for now , another @entity5 final at @entity177 's @entity176 awaits @entity19			1
not bad for a man who started out as an amateur snapper shooting park football on @entity181 in east @entity182			0
" we get to go to some great places and cover some great events			0
i had the pleasure of photographing the @entity188 in @entity189 ( in 2013 ) which was magnificent , " he says			0
" it 's times like these where you think : ' well , life does n't get any better			0
' " next week , @entity19 discusses an incredible image of @entity196 in full flow			2
