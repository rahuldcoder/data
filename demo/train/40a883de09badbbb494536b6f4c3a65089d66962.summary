-- nearly every day , @entity1 comes face to face with cancer and ca n't help but think about her life and how short it could be			1
for more than four years , the 56 - year - old photographer from @entity6 , @entity7 , has taken free portraits of people with terminal and life - threatening illnesses as part of the @entity13 , the nonprofit she founded in 2008 after her husband 's two sisters - in - law died from breast cancer			1
although the @entity13 , named for the two sisters , provided photos for families and children , @entity1 started @entity22 , a campaign specifically aimed at women with cancer , in summer 2010			1
" i 'll never be the same , " she said			0
" these women are already dealing with the choices of the things they want to accomplish or need to accomplish before their time here is over			0
they really see the things that are important			0
" the campaign began as a way to provide the women who lost their hair from cancer treatments photos in which they felt beautiful			1
although she had already been taking photos of people with cancer , @entity1 wanted to raise awareness , and from her extended family , knew what a powerful effect going bald had on women in particular			1
" when they lose their hair , 99.9 % of these women have said that they lose themselves , " she said			0
" they lose their identity			0
" @entity1 remembers one woman telling her that when her eyelashes and eyebrows fell out , she looked in the mirror and saw an alien			2
but when the women see their photos -- some somber and some lighthearted , posing with something significant to them -- they regain their self - image			2
@entity1 said some have even told her that they stopped wearing their wigs after the session			2
since the campaign started in july 2010 , @entity1 has photographed about 100 women -- ages 20 to 82 -- who have had cancer , as well as partnering with a local spa to pamper them and try to make them feel gorgeous for a day			1
although it began as a campaign planned to run until october , which is @entity73 , @entity1 said the feedback from the women was overwhelming and she extended the campaign to be a permanent fixture of the @entity13			1
" your will has a lot to do with progress that you make when you 're sick , " @entity1 said			2
" i firmly believe that if i can make women feel better about themselves , while they 're undergoing this treatment and have no hair , their treatment will be much more successful			2
" before starting a session , @entity1 turns up the music in her studio and strives for an optimistic perspective , determined to make the day an uplifting experience for the woman , even though she knows this particular visit is likely a trip woven into a schedule of radiation treatments and countless doctor visits			2
" you ca n't help putting yourself in these women 's shoes as i talk to each and every one of them , thinking , ' what if that was me ? ' " @entity1 said			1
" how would i react ? how would i deal with that ? many times , i do n't even have words			0
" if she did n't consciously take a more analytical approach to each woman 's cancer , @entity1 said , the project would be awful			1
it does n't mean the emotions are absent , but @entity1 , who used to be a nurse , knows she ca n't take on every burden she witnesses			2
toward the end of last fall when @entity117 , feel @entity118 was in full swing , @entity1 was scheduling sessions with up to 10 women a week and began to become physically and emotionally drained			1
" i was sleeping three hours a night because i was thinking about the person i photographed yesterday or the woman i was going to , " she said			0
" when you hear these people 's stories , you spend a couple hours with them -- photographing them , interviewing them -- you become part of their lives			0
" she stepped back from updating the campaign 's blog -- which was as often as she had a session -- and to her husband 's relief , scheduled the portraits at a slower pace to give herself time			2
@entity1 said the only thing more difficult than a session is hearing the news that one of her photo subjects has died			0
the first was @entity143 , 55 , who died in august 2010 after fighting lung cancer , and was also the very first person to be photographed with @entity146 , feel beautiful			1
@entity1 said five women have died since she began and it is devastating every time			1
dealing with the grief and looking mortality in the face has made @entity1 live differently			0
she said she does n't stress out about as many things because she has realized they simply do n't matter			0
what gets her out of bed in the morning when she knows that the day 's session will be tough is imagining that she has the ability to watch a woman overcome her insecurities and find peace in how she looks			0
" it does n't matter how bad my day is , i 'll bet you their day is worse , " @entity1 said			0
" and i 'm going to do all i can to make them look as good as i possibly can			0
" a little more than a year later , @entity1 knows it sounds like an extraordinary statement , but she believes the ongoing campaign has the potential to save lives			1
" if other women who are just newly diagnosed or have n't even been diagnosed yet see women like this who are strong , powerful , bold and feel good about themselves , they , too , will know that i can do this , " she said			1
" they wo n't panic when they find a lump , they wo n't just stick their heads in the sand and hope it 'll go away			0
