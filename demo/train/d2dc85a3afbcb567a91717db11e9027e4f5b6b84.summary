-- if you 're at a coffee shop , anywhere in @entity4 , or if it 's late at night , hang on to your smartphone			1
losing your smartphone can be stressful , given how much important data and access to services a typical one contains			1
on average , people lose their smartphone once per year , according to @entity13			1
recently , @entity13 analyzed phone loss data and found some interesting trends about where and when people lose their phones			1
this data is presented on a new interactive website , @entity21			0
@entity13 gathered data from its mobile security app , which is on more than 15 million cell phones around the world ( mostly @entity27 phones )			1
in 2011 , @entity13 found 9 million smartphones			2
( the company considered a phone as having gone missing whenever a user logged in to @entity13 via the @entity32 to find a phone			1
) " losing your phone is absolutely the biggest mobile security risk cell phone owners currently face , even more than malware , " said @entity34 , @entity13 's chief technology officer			2
" people lose their phones in the places they go every day			2
it 's not a stray comet from the sky snatching your phone			0
that 's why we wanted to study this			0
" when are people most likely to lose their phone ? @entity13 found that the vast majority of smartphone losses happen late at night , from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. looks like nightlife may be a culprit			1
but on holidays , or during major events such as festivals or big sporting events , people are especially likely to lose a phone			2
in 2011 , phone losses around the world spiked on @entity62 and @entity63			1
and on february 27 , 2011 , phones in @entity65 , @entity66 , were lost at nearly three times the normal rate during a major international rugby tournament there			2
in general , throughout the @entity73 , the five types of places where people are most likely to lose a cell phone are coffee shops , bars , restaurants , at the office or at home			0
also , the five @entity73 cities where people are most likely to lose a smartphone are @entity4 ; @entity82 ; @entity83 , @entity84			1
; @entity85 , @entity84 ; and @entity86 , @entity87			0
@entity34 observed that several of the top phone - losing cities also have high crime rates , but that does n't necessarily mean that more phones are stolen in these cities			1
@entity13 's data does not indicate what actually happened to those missing phones -- how many were stolen vs. lost , or how many were eventually found			2
that might be a subject for future @entity13 research , he said			0
however , where you 're most likely to lose your phone may depend on which city you live in			0
for instance , people in @entity106 , @entity107 , are most likely to lose phones at a gas station or garage , at the grocery store or at a pizza place			0
but church is the third most common setting where @entity116 lose their phones			0
and in @entity119 , people are most likely to lose a phone at the office			0
one reason why losing your smartphone is so risky is that recent research by @entity126 ( another mobile security provider ) showed that more than 95 % of the time , people who find lost smartphones try to access sensitive data or accounts on those phones -- which can including e-mail , online banking , photos and more			1
this is why it 's so important to always protect your cell phone with at least a security passcode or swipe pattern			0
what 's the cost of a lost smartphone ? @entity13 estimates the average replacement cost ( just the device , not counting costs associated with lost data , international phone calls , unauthorized online purchases and illicit access to online banking or other accounts ) is about $ 200			1
" for a lot of people , $ 200 is a lot of money , " @entity34 said			1
" it could be a month 's rent , or groceries			0
" that said , @entity34 emphasized that @entity13 did n't conduct this research to frighten people , but rather to help them understand the importance of protecting your phone			2
" you should never be afraid of your phone , " he said , " but you should know how to protect it			0
" consistently using a passcode or swipe pattern to lock your phone is the most basic level of protection -- not just from a random person who finds your lost phone , or a deliberate thief or snooper , but also from police			0
courts in several states have authorized police to conduct warrantless searches of cell phones seized from people under arrest , but they probably can not compel an arrestee to unlock a seized phone			2
several mobile security services offer additional features ( for an annual fee ) such as causing a lost phone to beep ( which can help if you just ca n't find where you put it down at home ) , or to show the current location of the phone on a map ( which in one case helped catch a carjacker ) , or to remotely lock or even wipe all data and contacts from a lost or stolen phone			1
the opinions expressed in this report are solely those of @entity205 .			0
