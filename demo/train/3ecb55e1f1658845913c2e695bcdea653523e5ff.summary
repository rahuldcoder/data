to understand @entity1 , it helps to go back 10 years , to a night he spent flying kites on a beach in his native @entity5 with the woman who would become his wife			1
she asked him whether he knew how to listen to the wind			0
being an engineer , he responded that wind produces only white noise , and white noise contains no information			0
but he loved her , so he opened his mind and gave it a try			0
" and i felt a deep joy , " @entity1 said during a recent talk at the @entity21 conference here			1
" and then i stopped pursuing information and efficiency , and i changed my life 's course a little and started to practice rituals of joy			0
" this childlike sense of play , curiosity and discovery -- one that many people lose as they move through adulthood -- has informed @entity1 's life and work ever since			1
it 's no accident that he shows audiences video clips of wide - eyed toddlers encountering snow for the first time or an @entity46 candy skittering around on a moving escalator			2
or that he took the stage at @entity21 in a t - shirt , baggy shorts and a surfer cap , looking more like a skateboarder than someone with a ph.d. from @entity55			1
yes , at 33 , @entity1 is something of a big kid himself			1
he 's also a leading proponent of the " maker movement , " the do - it - yourself culture of inventing , hacking and prototyping that inspires many young engineers in tech fields			1
at the @entity63 , @entity1 studied how to make tools that engage people 's creative spirit and help them make things with modern technology			1
one of his first creations was @entity70 , an electronic pencil that lets you make music as you draw			2
next up was something with the @entity77 name of @entity78 , an invention kit he developed at @entity55 with fellow student @entity81			1
funded by @entity83 ( they set a goal of $ 25,000 and raised $ 568,000 ) , the simple electronic kit contains a circuit board , alligator clips and usb cables and helps anyone turn everyday objects into touchpads that can be used to interact with a computer			1
people clamp the alligator clips to an object and then connect them through the kit to their computer			2
touching the object produces a tiny electrical connection , which the computer interprets as a keystroke or the movement of a mouse			1
the kits cost $ 50 and say " be stoked			2
the world is your construction kit ! " on the box			0
since they began shipping last summer , people around the world have used them to control computer programs with anything that can conduct electricity : fruit , plants , water , even household pets			2
one student at @entity119 won a talent show by hooking @entity121 to plates full of food and eating his way through a crowd - pleasing rendition of " @entity127			2
" @entity78 seems like a toy , and educators have used it to play games or teach kids about basic electrical circuitry			1
but @entity1 believes that his kit can also help engineers test concepts and prototypes more cheaply			1
" some people are just totally goofing around ( with the kits )			2
some people are making devices so that their son with cerebral palsy can access browsing the @entity142 , " he said			2
" i do n't know which of those two things actually are more important			0
they 're both , to me , really valuable			2
" @entity1 , now a maker - research scientist at @entity147 , hopes @entity78 will awaken the creative impulse in people and encourage them to tackle their own diy projects			1
" right now , in culture , there 's this feeling that we have to make ( things )			1
and i think it 's because we did n't make ( things ) for a while , with the @entity160 , " he said			2
" i think when you make something , you 're kind of making meaning and purpose			1
you 're kind of making the world what it is			1
you 're voting with your hands -- not in a booth but making change , right now , that really happens in your own space			1
" @entity174 long before that night on the beach , @entity1 's roiling imagination was inventing stuff			1
as a boy in @entity179 , @entity5 , he duct - taped a fork to a hand drill to make an automatic spaghetti - twirling machine			1
in fourth grade , he discovered by accident that his walkie - talkies communicated at the same frequency as his remote - control car			2
so he combined the car , an upside - down trash can and some other parts to make a robot he controlled by making certain sounds into the walkie - talkies			1
" like any good child of the ' 80s , i watched a lot of ' @entity197			0
' but i was pretty bad at making things , " he said			2
kites have more questions than answers			0
i love things with more questions than answers			0
" silver is fascinated by the idea of combining or refashioning objects , like his spaghetti twirler , to create uses for which they were not intended			1
" what is the purpose of things ? who said that was the purpose of it ? " he asked			2
" other people do n't have to decide the meaning of things			2
" it 's the same impulse that leads kids to play with a box instead of the toy that came in it			0
" i did n't need anything special to hack as a child			0
i just used whatever was around			0
i think all children do this , " @entity1 wrote in an e-mail			1
" i think this is one of the most special and also least unique things about all humans : they try everything every way and have very open minds , especially when young			0
" at @entity55 , @entity1 became part of a group called @entity174 , which seeks to foster creative adults through a " kindergarten style of learning " that emphasizes designing , experimenting and exploring			1
it was a great fit for him because it taught him to not fear failing , to keep trying different things			0
" i 'm kind of a bottom - up maker			1
i do n't have a plan			0
i do n't really know how things work that well			0
i just mess around with stuff , and things start to emerge , " he said			0
" it 's kind of like a conversation with materials			2
" @entity1 's approach -- part engineer , part artist , part curious 5 - year - old -- impressed his mentors at @entity55			1
" @entity1 is an incredible creative force			1
rarely have i met someone who spins out so many creative ideas			0
he really has the spirit of a tinkerer , always trying out new things , " said @entity263 , professor of learning research at the @entity63 " @entity1 has held on to that playful curiosity ( that children have ) and uses that to engage with people , " @entity263 added			1
" one thing that 's for sure is that @entity1 will do something that none of us will expect			1
he 'll create new paths that none of us are even thinking about today			0
and whatever it is , it 'll help people explore the world around them and bring joy to their lives			0
" creative confidence today , @entity1 lives in @entity285 , @entity286 , with his wife , @entity288 , an artist and early - childhood - creativity educator , and their son , @entity293 , 2			1
his job at @entity147 takes him to festivals and events such as the @entity297 , where he leads creative workshops on such activities as making digital circuits by drawing with a pencil			2
in return , he takes some of what he learns about prototyping back to @entity147 , which does research in a variety of futuristic computing fields			0
@entity1 is also still spreading the word about @entity121			1
his production company , @entity308 , has distributed about 20,000 of the kits			2
" the reason i 'm making this kit is that i 'm totally stoked about what i can do with it and what other people can do with it , " he said			2
" i hope that other people use it in a way that makes them feel alive			0
and if they are , it does n't matter to me if what they 're doing can be called useful or not			0
" silver talks wistfully about a utopian future where everyone creates their own unique space instead of settling for cookie - cutter homes or furnishings or decorations			1
" we just do n't want people running to @entity334 when they have a wobbly table , " he said			0
instead , @entity1 envisions a new generation of creative thinkers who cut and paste disparate materials to make something new that holds personal meaning for them -- like what artists and writers have been doing for centuries but on a broader scale			1
" take , for example , one of the cornerstones of creative icons : @entity353			0
legos let you build anything , right ? well , i am a fan of @entity353 , but there is one thing they are not communicating : the world you live in is a set of @entity353 , " he said			0
" that 's my message			0
you do n't need a kit , and you do n't need to stick to the pieces that come in the box			0
" to silver , such tinkering boosts " creative confidence " : the transformative power that comes with making something tangible and fresh			1
" if you get some kids thinking ' i can do this ' -- especially ones that would n't have had a chance to think that way -- that 's good enough for me			0
and we 're already seeing it happen , " he said			0
@entity1 's workshops are aimed mostly at children , but there 's a reason why he 's invited to speak at idea - driven conferences like @entity384 and @entity21			1
his lessons are applicable to any hidebound grad student or business executive : rewrite the rules			0
do n't be afraid to fail			0
to @entity1 , it 's human nature			1
" the world that i 'd like to live in is a world where everybody helps to make it in their own way , " he said			0
" so it 's a hodgepodge of different collections , of contributions ... reflecting everyone 's own internal inspiration			0
kind of the way nature is , but with humans			0
that would be a beautiful world			0

@entity1 is a leading proponent of " maker movement , " the do - it - yourself culture of inventing
his @entity78 kits let anyone turn everyday objects into computer interfaces
