-- if there were ever a contest for " @entity5 's sweetheart , " @entity1 would be tough to beat			1
the daughter of an @entity8 employee and a @entity10 vocal coach , @entity1 has continually struck a chord with fans over her nearly 30 - year career			1
at turns charming and relatable , she comes across as extremely genuine in a field that makes its magic through pretending			2
as the actress celebrates her 50th birthday on july 26 , her stock as the long - standing favorite is as solid as ever			1
examine the evidence : she is firmly in the top 10 list of @entity24 's highest paid actresses , and her films tend to make money			2
her 2013 sci - fi thriller " gravity , " which starred @entity1 as an astronaut lost in space , earned $ 716 million worldwide			1
and in her personal life , @entity1 has managed to remain pretty scandal - proof			1
at the height of a devastating marital breakup from @entity35 in 2010 , when lurid tabloid headlines appeared about his alleged affairs , @entity1 shocked the world with news that she had secretly adopted an @entity41 - @entity5 son from @entity42			1
not only was it surprising that the @entity45 - winning actress had such a tight circle that she was able to conceal a monumental personal moment , but unlike some other celebs who had been criticized in the black community for transracial adoptions , @entity1 and her decision were mostly embraced			1
even other celebrities adore her			2
" @entity54 " star @entity53 has been quoted as saying @entity1 was his first celebrity crush			1
" i saw ' @entity56 ' when i was in seventh grade , and i was like , that 's my lady , " @entity53 said			2
" i literally had a big poster ( of her )			0
" it 's easy to see why a preteen @entity53 fell for @entity1			1
in interviews @entity1 can be funny , self - deprecating and just downright cool			1
during an appearance on " the @entity66 with @entity67 " to promote her 2013 buddy cop comedy , " @entity69 , " she and the host good - naturedly took verbal swipes at each other			0
when @entity67 mentioned the film " @entity72 " ( in an apparent reference to the way their interview was going ) , @entity1 volleyed back about that movie			1
" poop humor is fun , " she said jokingly			0
" if you do the toilet scenes well and commit to them they can be really , really powerful			0
" not many @entity45 winners would tackle such a subject , but it 's not surprising from @entity1 , who proudly told @entity86 that her now - 3 - year - old son , @entity87 , is fully potty - trained			1
while the actress has almost always been tagged as more girl next door than vixen , motherhood has clearly helped settle her even more			2
she 's been very outspoken about the fact that she would give it all up , the career and the fame , if it was n't good for her son in any way			1
" i do n't want him to have pressures brought on by what i do			0
i will leave , " she told @entity100 last year			0
" if i see whatever i 'm doing affecting him negatively , i will pack up and move to @entity103			0
" that probably helps explain why the self - professed homebody would much rather be spending time with her kid than working the press			0
eschewing the @entity24 scene , the " @entity109 " star has made paparazzi literally chase her outside the usual city limits , choosing to build her life in cities like @entity115 , @entity116 , and @entity42			0
being on the red carpet , she told @entity0 at a 2013 premiere of " gravity , " is extreme enough for her			0
" being in front of a camera , in a nice dress , getting all dressed up is extreme , " @entity1 said			2
" there 's a lot of other extreme situations , you know , just getting out of bed sometimes is extreme -- but i do it			0
just got to do it , just got to get up			0
put your sweatpants on , brush off the dog hair and just get out of the house ! " part of what @entity1 does when she gets " out of the house " is give back to the @entity42			1
after the devastation of @entity138 , @entity1 " adopted " @entity139 , and has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to the institution			2
in may 2014 , she surprised the graduating class with a commencement speech			0
" they 're infections , they inspire me , " @entity1 said of the students			2
" they make me get off my butt and try to do better			0
... i 've been taking and taking from ( the @entity42 ) , and when everything happened with @entity138 , that 's when you realize you have to put back			0
