-- the parents of @entity3 @entity2 , found hanging in his @entity6 apartment last june , tell @entity0 they may exhume their son 's body to conduct an autopsy in the @entity3			1
@entity2 's mother @entity10 says an exhumation may be the only way to prove " for sure " the family 's contention that he was murdered			1
the @entity15 walked out of the @entity6 inquiry into their son 's death earlier this week , saying , " we 've lost faith in the process " and @entity6 's inquiry process was " pre-determined " to conclude their son 's death was a suicide , and that police and investigators never considered evidence that may suggest @entity2 was murdered			1
" we told the police at the very beginning			0
we talked to shane every week for three months at least , all the way up to june when he passed away , ( and he said ) that he was in fear for his life , " @entity2 's father @entity31 told @entity0			0
" you would think they would look into it			0
but none of that happened			0
" the inquiry into the death of @entity2 , found hanging in his @entity6 apartment on june 24 , comes after @entity6 's medical examiner concluded that @entity2 committed suicide			1
state attorneys said during the hearing that @entity2 's laptop shows he accessed suicide - related web pages in the months before his death , with a search in march on how to tie a hangman 's noose			2
but @entity2 's parents -- who had flown from their home in @entity57 to attend the hearings -- claimed there was evidence that his death was a homicide			2
the @entity62 claim their son was murdered because of sensitive knowledge he had of a project using gallium nitride ( @entity67 ) between the @entity68 ( @entity69 ) -- a @entity6 government - backed research agency -- and the @entity73 telecom giant @entity72			1
@entity67 is material that can withstand high temperatures and can be used in power amplifiers with a range of applications from light emitting displays to radar communications			0
documents found on @entity2 's laptop after his death reportedly indicate @entity69 may have had plans with @entity73 telecom giant @entity72 to co-develop an amplifier using @entity67			1
such a device could have both military as well as civilian uses			0
the 31 - year - old @entity2 had been working for 18 months at @entity69 when he decided to quit his job and return home to the @entity3 shortly before his death			1
employees of @entity69 have testified that there were several meetings held with @entity72 , including a meeting with their senior level employees that @entity2 attended , but both @entity69 and @entity72 assert no project agreement was concluded , according to testimony			1
@entity96 , deputy executive director of research at @entity69 and @entity2 's supervisor , testified that his agency does not conduct any classified military research			1
the @entity62 say they have evidence to show their son had been instructed to hand copy a @entity67 " recipe " or formula from a @entity3 vendor where @entity2 had been sent for training			2
the family says he had been left alone in a room to hand copy formulas , and say evidence from @entity2 's computer shows he had handwritten " highly sensitive recipes			2
" @entity96 denied in court that he had instructed @entity2 to hand copy recipes and said hand copied recipes would be inaccurate and therefore " useless			0
" the @entity15 stood up in the middle of the inquest proceedings tuesday and walked out in objection to a witness they were unfamiliar with -- a friend and former work colleague of their son 's who testified he 'd had a beer with him the night before @entity2 was found hanging on june 24			1
" we 're getting sprung stuff at the last moment , " @entity123 said outside court			0
he said the state had given them no prior notice of the witness @entity129 @entity130			0
the @entity15 said they had been " told from the beginning that this will be honest and open " and pointed out that their own lawyers had just hours before been chastised by @entity6 's judge @entity134 for introducing last - minute documents			2
@entity6 senior counsel @entity136 referenced @entity130 in his may 13 opening statement and at that same time said the state would try to bring @entity130 in as a witness			0
just hours before , a key witness for the @entity2 family , @entity3 medical examiner dr @entity141 , retracted his original assertion that @entity2 had been strangled by a cord and hanged			2
testifying via video link , @entity141 agreed with other forensic pathologists in the case including two @entity3 medical examiners , who reviewed the case at @entity6 's request , that there would need to be evidence of internal neck injuries if @entity2 had been " garroted			1
" however , @entity141 continued to assert that @entity2 had been murdered and speculated that he had been killed and then hanged to make it look like suicide			2
" i have to assume that people who know how to kill you can do it in a way that is difficult to detect , " @entity141 added			0
he did not examine @entity2 's body and came to his initial conclusions on the basis of photographs taken by the family just before the funeral and @entity6 's autopsy report			1
his new opinions come after the family provided him with a series of photos obtained from @entity6 police and forensic officials			0
questioned about the photos by a lawyer for the state , @entity141 admitted , " the cause of death is difficult for me to say			0
