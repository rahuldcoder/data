-- they are known as the hippies of the ape kingdom , a peaceful and affectionate species that is more interested in making love than killing each other			0
one of the world 's rarest apes , bonobos are close cousins of chimpanzees and share 98.7 % of human dna			1
but unlike their ape relatives -- and humans -- bonobos shy away from engaging in vicious conflicts			0
instead , they share food , groom each other and use a variety of sexual activities to build relationships , promote social bonding and strengthen alliances			0
it is , then , an ironic twist that the very existence of this affable species has come under threat by decades of war and deforestation in one of @entity34 's most troubled parts			1
found only in the @entity36 , the bonobos inhabit the country 's lowland rainforests along the south bank of the @entity40			1

although the bonobo habitat is located several hundred miles away from the epicenter of the crisis , conservationists say that the country 's instability over the years has made it almost impossible to study bonobos and find out where they are or determine how many are left			1
at the same time , the expansion of the commercial bushmeat trade -- the selling of wild animal meat , such as that of the endangered bonobo -- threatens the survival of the apes even further			1
" the decade of war in the late 1990s resulted in extensive population displacement , military / rebel movements and a greater availability of firearms and ammunition , which contributed to increased hunting of wildlife , including bonobos , " says @entity69 , of @entity70 , a group supporting @entity72 , the world 's first and only sanctuary for the endangered species			1
born of necessity from the increasing threat of the bushmeat trade , @entity72 was founded in the mid- 1990s by @entity89 , a @entity90 - born conservationist who was working at the time as a volunteer in @entity93 's zoo			1
it was there that @entity96 , who moved with her veterinarian father to @entity40 at the age of three , saw a bonobo for the first time -- an encounter that was destined to change her life forever			0

but soon she found herself needing a bigger space as the number of bonobos she took under her wing started to grow			2
the @entity36 government eventually stepped in to help set up a more permanent home that would become @entity72			1
the sanctuary , which is located just outside @entity93 in some 30 hectares of primary forest , is today home to at least 65 bonobos , many of which are young orphans that have been either rescued from the wild or brought in after hunters killed their parents			1
" bushmeat never stops , " says @entity96			0
" we have no solution and we receive more and more orphans every year			0
" an important part of the sanctuary 's work is rehabilitating injured bonobos from the forest and , hopefully , one day returning them to the wild			1
" conservation asks us to make a test for reintroduction in the wild , " says @entity96			0
" so we make this experience two times already since 2009 , a group of bonobos from here , returned to the wild			0
and for them it was a success because after two - three months , they are home			0

staff at @entity72 say that some 40,000 people come through its doors each year , including tourists and local schoolchildren , as well as graduate students conducting research on everything from bonobo behaviour to the evolution of the human brain			2
conservationists say stability in the @entity36 is essential to ensure that bonobo conservation programs are not jeopardized			2
" advocating for wildlife conservation is always a battle in a country as poor as the @entity36 , " says @entity69			2
" in times of crisis , when the security and basic needs of civilian populations are often not assured , it becomes even more challenging			0
if eco-guards and staff have to be evacuated from certain areas for their own safety , equipment , infrastructure and sometimes animals suffer			0
" only with peace and stability can long - term investments in wildlife conservation -- research , conservation education , community - based habitat protection and eco-tourism -- be successfully implemented			0

the endangered bonobo is only found in the @entity36
war , deforestation and bushmeat trade are all threatening bonobos
@entity72 is the world 's first and only sanctuary for the peaceful apes
it is currently home to more than *60* bonobos
