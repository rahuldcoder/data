-- goofing around in the office has been taken to a whole new level by a couple of guys who work for @entity4 , a website creation company in @entity6			1
@entity7 and @entity8 started making what they call " painting remixes " in early november			1
the side - by - side mashups of everything from @entity17 's " @entity16 " to @entity15 's 1943 self - portrait " @entity23 " have gathered thousands of followers on their website , @entity21 and @entity22 pages			1
the project they 've dubbed " @entity26 " began on a whim , and got an unlikely assist from @entity7 's mother			1
" we were sitting around with some friends at work and we randomly ended up reenacting a scene from the @entity34 , " the pair wrote in an email to @entity0			2
" one of our coworkers pulled out her phone and took a picture which we thought was funny but we did n't initially think anything of it			0
@entity7 texted the photo to his mom , who then stitched our shot together with a photograph from the actual @entity34 and texted it back to @entity7			1
" thus began a quest to recreate some of the most iconic works of art in the world in their downtime at work			1
the rules : they can use only props that are available in the office and any photo editing must be done on their smartphones using apps like @entity60 , @entity61 , and @entity62			2
" we really enjoy the @entity66 look of the photos so we also made a rule against using @entity69 , " the pair said			2
both men are art lovers and avid photographers outside of work too			1
@entity8 was printmaker specializing in antiquarian photo - chemical printmaking processes before moving over to the tech field			1
so they 've got some background in creating beautiful things			0
they 've also got access to much cooler office supplies than your average cubicle dweller			2
@entity4 is a creatively fertile workplace , they say , and you never know what 's lurking around , waiting to be incorporated into a photo shoot			1
" there 's always lots of strange stuff sitting around , " they wrote			0
" some of it has been left from past @entity92 costumes and some has just randomly appeared			0
the unicorn mask was a mystery for a long time			0
no one knew where it came from			0
we found out recently that it belongs to a coworker in another department who brought it over a couple years ago			0
" their bosses are supportive , and the shoots are a small part of their workday			0
it can take anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes to do one recreation , " depending on how complex the image is and how creative we have to get with the costumes			2
" colleagues have been eager to get in on the fun by posing , assisting and lending clothing and props to the project			1
you can help too : the guys are taking idea submissions via their website			0
maybe a little @entity123 abstraction next ?			0
