-- ca n't stand the heat of the first tennis grand slam of 2014 ? then you clearly have n't been doing enough @entity5 yoga			2
that 's the view of leading sports scientist dr. @entity7 , who suggests any tennis star with designs on success at a sweltering @entity11 in @entity12 should have come already acclimatized to the hot and sweaty conditions			1
@entity15 @entity14 branded conditions at this year 's tournament " inhumane " after he fainted during his opening match , while other players have complained of burned feet and melted water bottles in temperatures which have lingered above a sweltering 40 degrees @entity22			1
" if you go there and you 're not prepared for the heat , it 's not going to be your grand slam , " dr. @entity7 , who has worked with the @entity24 , @entity25 and the @entity26 among others , told @entity0			1
" we know acclimatization makes a massive difference to performance in the heat			0
there 's a mental and a physical component to the training			2
it 's those little nuances in preparation that make the difference			1
" world no. 4 @entity44 has been a finalist in @entity12 in three of the last four years and for the last five years has been a bikram yoga practitioner - a sequence of 26 yoga moves done in a piping hot studio at temperatures of over 40 degrees @entity51			1
while even @entity44 has questioned the wisdom of staging a tournament in soaring temperatures , world no. 1 @entity52 revealed wednesday the fear of dehydration was giving her sleepless nights			1
not that the myriad of player complaints have influenced tournament doctor @entity61			2
blog : five players to watch in 2014 " we look into the health and well being of players , but we know over the years in different parts of the country and world they play under these conditions , " dr. @entity61 told a press conference			2
" ( players ) sit down every five to ten minutes for every 90 seconds at change of ends , so there is chance to lose some heat at that time			0
tennis by and large is a low risk sport , and that 's why by and large , like cricket , we can play in these conditions and not be too concerned			1
" a lot of people get hot and look distressed and hot and bothered , as we all do			0
the actually risk to the health is relatively small compared to other sports			2
" dr. @entity61 was equally bullish on players ' fears surrounding dehydration			2
. " dehydration , look , we have never had anybody die from dehydration on a tennis court , " he added			2
" we have had players almost die from drinking too much			0
so the danger is overdrinking , not underdrinking and becoming dehydrated			0
" again , given the length of time tennis matches generally go for and the sweat rate of most normal , healthy athletes , they wo n't get to a state where they get too critically dehydrated			1
" so , no , we have never had to put a drip in someone who has been so dehydrated that their vital signs , blood pressure and heart rate , have been compromised			0
" if the weather , in the eyes of the event officials , becomes too extreme for play to continue , tournament referee @entity110 has the power to call a halt to proceedings			1
he makes the judgment , in consultation with other parties , using a scale which not only factors in the ambient temperature , but also wind and humidity			0
so far , according to @entity110 , the relatively low humidity has meant conditions are fine for play to proceed as planned			0
in theory , unless humidity increases , play could continue even if the mercury hits 42 , 43 or even 44 degrees			2
@entity44 used his press conference to voice concerns over players suffering from heart attacks or other serious health problems as a result of the oppressive weather			2
despite @entity14 's collapse , and @entity142 's @entity141 vomiting and complaining of cramps , dr. @entity7 supported @entity61 's assessment that playing in the tournament would prove fatal for any of the players			1
put simply ; it 's hot , it 's horrible , but it 's probably not going to kill you			2
" i do n't want belittle what the players are experience , " explained dr. @entity7			1
" i 'm of the opinion that the danger is a little bit overhyped			0
" death is a failure of normal physiology , it 's not a normal situation			0
your body temperature is around 37 degrees @entity22 , when you hit 40 degrees that 's pretty much lights out but not death			1
" death happens when your body temperature is at 41 or 42 degrees and you have to be there for quite a long time			0
your body has a defense mechanism which forces you stop exercising , to fail , to become fatigued , to potentially pass out at around 40 degrees			1
" the risk is more about performance			0
@entity14 is fine , he did n't die and he would n't have			1
as soon as you remove yourself from the heat , the risk has gone			0
" to try and give the players respite from the blazing sun , organizers implemented an extreme weather contingency plan which allows for extended player breaks between the second and third sets			1
but there 's a catch ... it only applies to women 's matches			1
it 's a plan which has irked @entity44 , who called for greater equality between men 's and women 's games			1
" you would need the same for the men , " said @entity7			1
" the men are bigger , being big in the heat is a disadvantage			0
the smaller you are the better you are in the heat			0
big guys generate more heat , that 's why long distance runners are always small			0
" the rationale behind the break is good , but i do n't know why they 're only giving it to the women			2
if it keeps going like this they might need more of those kinds of breaks			0
" while he is receptive to the concerns voiced by players like @entity44 and @entity14 , not to mention @entity219 's @entity218 who was concerned for his life during his match , dr. @entity7 does n't think the tournament needs to be relocated or rescheduled			1
" it 's a bit fatalistic to say the show must go on , " he concluded			0
" how many players have played ? only one has collapsed			0
" i would argue that the story might be the 259 guys who have n't collapsed			0
yes they 're struggling and it 's really challenging , but it 's going to become one of the distinctive things about the @entity11			1
" if you ca n't stand the heat , stay out of the @entity237 .			0

temperatures at the @entity11 tennis tournament have exceeded 40 degrees @entity22
@entity15 @entity14 fainted during his first round defeat on *tuesday*
sports scientist dr. @entity7 says @entity245 is good preparation for high temperatures
tournament 's " extreme weather " contingency plan has been implemented in women 's matches
