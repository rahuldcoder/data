-- an environmentally - friendly surfboard has taken to the waves after five years in development			0
surf 's up : @entity5 tries out the @entity7 eco-surfboard			1
@entity9 profession surfer @entity8 was one of the first to try the @entity9 - made board at @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , giving its performance and eco-credentials the thumbs up			1
" it felt good and i can see these boards being popular with surfers			2
we spend a lot of time on the beach and in the sea and surfers have been campaigning to clean up the oceans for years			2
this board goes hand - in - hand with that philosophy , " said @entity5			0
the surfboard has been in development in the south west of @entity13 for five years and is the culmination of a collaboration between the @entity7 gardens and biosphere and three local companies			1
@entity39 , former sustainability director of the @entity7 and a lifelong surfer and committed environmentalist came up with the idea for the board when a balsa tree had to be taken down in the rainforest biome			1
" i said , well , let 's make a completely sustainable surfboard , because i knew people who could laminate in hemp cloth and plant - based resin , so we went for it			0
it was a eureka moment : we thought , let 's really have a go , let 's really see what we can do , " he told @entity0			0
@entity39 and the @entity59 soon realized that balsa and hemp cloth were too heavy for commercially viable surfboards , but desire remained to produce a surfboard that reduces the reliance on petroleum chemicals and uses more sustainable materials			0
the @entity7 team worked with local company @entity70 to create a new type of foam core for the eco-board , 15 to 20 percent of which is made from plant derived material			1
another local @entity12 company , @entity76 , developed a resin made almost entirely from linseed oil instead of oil - derived coatings , meaning over 50 percent of the final finished surfboards are made from renewable materials			1
completing the use of local companies , the boards are being manufactured by surfboard shapers , @entity86			1
junior @entity9 surfing champion @entity87 is set to compete at the @entity89 in @entity90 on a new @entity7 surfboard			2
" it 's a really good board , it worked really well , " said @entity92 after her first outing on the board			0
" it feels a lot more buoyant in the nose which makes it easier to catch waves			0
it will really catch on when people realize that it 's as good as a regular board			0

new eco-surfboard made with over 50 percent renewable materials
developed by @entity7 in @entity13 in *tandem* with local companies
manufacturers hope it will appeal to surfers who are *traditionally* *eco-conscious*
