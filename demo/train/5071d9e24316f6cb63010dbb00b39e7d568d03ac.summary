-- @entity1 was diagnosed with prostate cancer when he was 47			1
his response was to set up " @entity4 , " an organization that uses the universal language of beer to reach men with its message about the importance of prostate cancer screening			1
in 2008 , at the insistence of a colleague with prostate cancer , @entity1 , from @entity17 , @entity18 , had himself tested for illness , even though he had no health problems			1
his doctor was initially reluctant to have him tested , as men under the age of 50 are n't considered to a high - risk group for prostate cancer , but tests came back positive and @entity1 needed surgery to remove the cancer			1
his surgeon said that if @entity1 had waited until he was 50 to be screened , he would probably have only lived another two or three years			0
" i 'm doing great now , " @entity1 told @entity0			0
" i have to get tested every six months for the next 15 years , but i really feel like i dodged a bullet			0
" prostate cancer affects one in six men @entity33 men , with 27,000 @entity33 expected to die from the disease this year			1
the @entity35 believes health care professionals should discuss the potential benefits and limitations of prostate cancer early detection testing with men before any testing begins			2
it says that should include an offer for yearly testing with the prostate - specific antigen blood test and digital rectal exam , beginning at age 50 , to men who are at average risk of prostate cancer and have at least a 10 - year life expectancy			1
but @entity1 says other groups recommend that men should be screened once they reach their forties			0
" i think it 's a financial issue in a lot of cases rather than a health issue as to why that guideline is 50 , " he told @entity0			0
" the fact of the matter is not many men are going to have prostate cancer in their forties , but for those who do , if they wait until they 're 50 to be tested , their numbers are n't going to look very good			1
" @entity1 founded " pints for @entity69 " to spread the message about need for regular prostate health screenings			1
the organization travels to beer festivals and tries to engage with men in an informal way			1
" beer is a universal thing for men , " @entity1 told @entity0			2
" where women get together and talk about health issues , men really do n't , so we try to use an atmosphere like a pub , where guys are a little bit more relaxed , to talk about prostate cancer			2
" he says prostate cancer is a highly personal disease for men , in much the same way that breast cancer is for women			2
treatment for prostate cancer can sometimes result in impotence			0
" the pink ribbon campaign has really made it possible for women to talk about breast cancer , so we 're trying to do the same thing for guys			0
they need permission to talk about it , " said @entity1			0
as well as setting up stalls at beer festivals and organizing events in pubs , " pints for @entity69 " has run adverts in magazines and @entity1 estimates its message has reached about 30 million people			1
a year after his own surgery , @entity1 's first granddaughter was born			0
he is aware that by being screened for prostate cancer he has vastly improved his chances of seeing her grow up , and he hopes that by encouraging other men to be tested he will give them a similar opportunity			2
he told @entity0 , " i 'm hoping that there 's a whole bunch of other guys out there who 'll be able to experience the same thing [ as me ] -- see their families grow up and grow old			0
