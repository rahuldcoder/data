-- this @entity1 is no protector of reputations			0
nor is it anything other than steadfast in its refusal to reveal any clear favorite to hoist the 20th incarnation of football 's prime feast			0
@entity12 certainly counts as one of a pool of nations capable of capturing glory , but its performances so far have shown a worrying brittleness			2
still , it just keeps on winning and can now look forward to a last eight clash with either the @entity20 or @entity21			2
the latest side to come close to toppling @entity12 was @entity23 , but just like @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 before them , one moment of magic was all that separated the two in tuesday 's penultimate last - 16 clash			1
with the contest a matter of seconds away from penalties , the decisive blow was conjured between two men who operate at opposite ends of @entity41 's fiercest rivalry			0
@entity42 , of @entity43 , drove deep into @entity45 territory and swept the ball wide for @entity48 's @entity47 , who stroked confidently into the corner			1
yet there was still more agony for @entity23 to endure			2
with even its goalkeeper playing as a striker , a point - blank header from @entity53 crashed against the post before squirming wide in the 122nd minute			0
@entity12 's fevered reaction upon the final whistle underscored a palpable sense of relief that its bandwagon continues to edge closer to a first triumph since 1986			1
" i was nervous towards the end because we could n't score and any mistake could have knocked us out , " @entity12 captain @entity42 told a press conference			1
" the minutes were passing by and we did n't want the match to go to penalties			0
we were suffering , but we had a special play , i passed to @entity47 and now we can celebrate			2
" with @entity23 keen to limit any slice of space for @entity12 's array of attacking talent to operate in , the opening stages of the game in @entity73 were predictably tight			1
there was a glimpse of goal for @entity42 a little under the quarter hour mark but his stabbed cross-shot was pocketed by @entity45 goalkeeper @entity83			2
once the contest had settled into a pattern , @entity12 's failure to engage an powerful offensive arsenal afforded @entity23 a growing confidence which reflected in its play			1
the game 's first gilt - edged opening arrived on 28 minutes , and it was one carved out by two players who operate in @entity94 's @entity93			2
@entity96 star @entity95 found midfielder @entity97 , who plays for @entity98 , with a pullback but his low , powerful drive was repelled by @entity101			0
@entity103 star @entity102 tested @entity83 from striker @entity105 's knockdown as @entity12 looked to reassert its dominance			1
@entity95 was again the provider when a sharp counter attack released @entity109 in on goal			0
with @entity101 caught in two minds whether to hunt down the through ball , the @entity112 striker looked to take advantage with a chip but got the execution horribly wrong			0
@entity12 's stopper continued to look uncertain after the interval as he spilled a @entity95 free kick from range and had to scramble to prevent the ball from escaping his penalty area			1
as the hour mark loomed @entity12 rediscovered a glimmer of its attacking brio , with @entity23 forced to retreat further and further towards its own goal			1
as red - shirted legs became heavy @entity12 pressed for the breakthrough and @entity83 was prompted into action when @entity132 's attempted cross crept towards the net			1
@entity105 then rose highest to power a header towards goal but @entity83 was alert to acrobatically divert the @entity138 striker 's effort over the bar			0
perhaps inspired by the goal of the tournament so far -- @entity143 's explosive volley in @entity145 's last - 16 win over @entity146 -- @entity42 attempted his own , firing narrowly over the bar			1
it looked as though @entity42 's moment had arrived on 78 minutes as he picked up the ball on the edge of the box and jinked onto his wand of a left foot			1
but just as the thousands of @entity12 fans inside the stadium prepared to hail their saviour once more , @entity83 flung out his right hand to make a superb save and ensure the game remained goalless			2
as @entity161 had done the previous evening , @entity23 burrowed away with the prospect of an extra half an hour the prize at the end of a long , weary tunnel			1
and despite a few nervous moments , when the right weight of pass or split second decision could have fashioned a late winner , the @entity45 saw it through to the end of 90 minutes			0
the extra half hour continued in the same vain , the @entity45 content to soak up pressure in a congested final third and look for counter attacking opportunities			0
@entity83 was called upon to save from a glancing header from @entity180 while @entity42 was lucky to escape a booking after a tangle with @entity183			2
@entity47 , who enjoyed such a stellar end of season with @entity186 winners @entity48 , cut a profligate figure through the game , but tested @entity83 with a stinging drive from range			1
and his big moment would arrive , as so many of @entity12 's have , via the boots of @entity42			1
the three - time @entity194 winner drove towards a flagging @entity45 defense before offloading to @entity47 , whose precise finish back across @entity197 found the far corner			1
that sparked delirium among the hordes of traveling @entity12 fans but its side 's leaky rearguard almost offered up another twist in the game 's dying stages			1
with @entity83 installed as center forward , a succession of crosses flowed into @entity12 's penalty area			1
from one , midfielder @entity53 found himself unmarked and five yards from goal when the ball arrived at his eye level			0
but his header cannoned off the post with @entity101 stranded and struck him once more , only for the ball to trickle wide of the upright			0
@entity95 then won a free kick right on the edge of the penalty area as nerves at both ends shredded yet further , but once the wall had repelled his effort the final whistle sounded			0
coach @entity225 stuck to the classic football adage of taking one game at a time			0
" our dream is only to work for the next match and try to move onto the semifinals , " he said			0
" we do not look beyond that			0
to do so would be a mistake as we have already seen good teams like @entity41 , @entity146 , @entity236 and @entity237 have gone out			0
" @entity12 limps on , but winning ugly wo n't matter a jot to its players or fans should a first @entity1 in 24 years result from it .			2

@entity47 strikes deep in extra time as @entity12 defeat @entity23 1 - 0
the @entity48 star scores from @entity42 's cute through ball
@entity12 were far from their best but continue to march on in @entity249
they will meet the @entity20 or @entity249 in the *quarterfinal*
