-- muslims around the world woke up sunday and welcomed the end of a long month of fasting with hearty greetings of " @entity5 , " or happy festivities			1
@entity8 women perform the @entity10 dawn prayer at a stadium in @entity12 , 120 km north of @entity13			1
the faithful were ushering in @entity10 -- three days of celebrations that @entity1 mark with joyous community prayers , acts of charity , visits from far - flung relatives , gift - giving and elaborate feasts			1
" @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity24 's -- all rolled into one			2
it 's that huge for us , " said @entity27 of @entity28 , @entity29			0
@entity32 follows a lunar calendar , and the timing of @entity10 varies around the world depending on when the crescent of a new moon is sighted			1
so , while most countries -- including the @entity40 -- observed @entity10 on sunday , some will begin their celebrations on monday			1
the night before @entity10 , entire communities gather on rooftops , scanning the sky with giddy anticipation			2
" it only needs one sighting of the moon in the whole country , and the whole nation erupts in cheers , " said @entity46 , 35 , of @entity47 , @entity48			2
" it 's a divine feeling , hard to describe			0
" @entity10 bids goodbye to @entity56 -- a month of dawn - to - dusk abstinence from food , drinks and other sensual pleasures			1
@entity1 believe the @entity61 , the religion 's holy book , was revealed to @entity63 during @entity56 more than 1,400 years ago			1
the @entity10 is one of two major holidays in @entity32 , alongside another called @entity66			2
the latter commemorates the prophet @entity69 's willingness to sacrifice his son , @entity70 , for @entity71			0
on the morning of @entity10 , @entity1 don new clothes and head to prayers that are often held in open fields to accommodate crowds too big to contain in mosques			1
those who can afford it donate a small percentage of their possession or its equivalent to the poor and needy so they too can avail themselves for the celebrations			0
feasts await at every house			0
" it 's a festival principally about community			0
we 're even asked to take a different route when we walk back from prayers so that we can meet different sets of people to greet and celebrate with , " said @entity89 of @entity90 , @entity91			2
for @entity1 in @entity99 -- and countries where they are the minority -- @entity10 is a more subdued affair			1
" if you have family close by , then you can kind of capture the mood that you remember from back home , " said @entity102 , a native of @entity8 who lives in @entity103 , @entity104			0
" but it 's not the same			0
" because the @entity40 @entity111 does not ask about religious affiliation , it is difficult to gauge the @entity1 population in the @entity40			2
the @entity115 study conducted two years ago estimated it at 2.5 million , while the @entity117 places it as high as 6 million			0
on saturday , both president @entity119 and secretary of state @entity120 offered greetings to @entity40 muslims			1
" we know there is more than unites peoples of faith than divides us , " @entity123 said			0
" so as @entity56 draws to a close , let us hold on to that spirit of community throughout the year to achieve our common goals of peace , prosperity and stability			2
" it is a message that @entity137 's president , @entity136 , also shared during @entity10 prayers when he called on the @entity139 to join the peace process in his war - weary country			1
the day was n't one of universal comity , however			0
in @entity147 , the government and rebels accused each other saturday of breaking a cease - fire they both asked for to commemorate @entity10			1
and @entity151 's supreme leader @entity150 used his @entity10 sermon to launch another volley at the country 's arch - rival @entity156 and at @entity158 powers			1
" we 're not quite there , i 'll will admit , " said @entity159 of @entity160 , @entity161			0
" but have you seen an @entity10 prayer ? rows and rows of @entity1 all prostrating together in unison			1
it 's a feeling of such unity and brotherhood			0
you have to believe that with that spirit present , anything is possible			0
