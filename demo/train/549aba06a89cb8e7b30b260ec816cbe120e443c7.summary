-- @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 are the top three destinations to visit in 2014 , according to the hot - off - the - press @entity6 in @entity7			1
the rationale : well the first is pretty obvious since @entity1 is hosting the @entity9			1
it 's the centenary of polar explorer @entity12 's @entity2 expedition , while @entity3 's nod is mainly due to it staging the @entity15 in the summer and celebrating the @entity16 for overseas @entity3			2
a great accent probably also helps			0
published this week , @entity6 's ninth annual roundup of best destinations around the world for the upcoming year was based on " scores for topicality , excitement and that special x-factor , " as determined by their inhouse experts and outside writers			1
and there are a few surprises			0
the quiet , peaceful , pretty and sometimes ( unfairly ) maligned @entity29 in @entity30 made the top 10 cities for 2014 ( possibly because of some of those adjectives )			0
the ranking prompted this response from an @entity37 media outlet : was @entity6 drunk when it rated @entity29 ? the travel guide went with @entity40 as the best city next year ( it did n't make the top 10 last year ) , with @entity43 in second place ( january marks the 500th anniversary of the foundation of @entity43 ) and @entity47 coming in third			1
in terms of regions as destinations , @entity48 in @entity49 was voted the best , for " showing the way for what could be the future of @entity49 's tourism industry			1
" some more notable predictions included @entity59 region as " the next big thing " in @entity61 and the @entity62 as the best value destination due to recently lowered tourism prices and fewer tourist numbers			2
in addition to the more standard roundups , there are also some more inventive lists ranging from " 10 essential travel destinations for @entity71 " ( it 's the 50th anniversary of the @entity73 going to in @entity74 ) and " the cat 's meow : top 10 destinations for feline fanatics " to " 10 shakespearean sites for travelers " in honor of the 450th anniversary of the playwright 's birth			2
