@entity2 will complain that they had a cast iron penalty denied by the officials , when @entity25 was brought down in the box in the 80th minute			2
but the referee did n't see it that way and booked the @entity31 striker for diving			0
moments later , @entity11 evaded @entity2 's offside trap before executing a cool finish over a flailing @entity35 in goal			2
the @entity38 misery was compounded when @entity11 broke through again in injury time , weaving through a series of tackles , before firing precisely into the top corner			0

@entity78 opened the scoring for the visitors with a pinpoint strike after 18 minutes , while @entity82 added a second shortly after the break , dinking the ball over a defender before firing home -- the ball rebounding off both posts before finding the net			0
a red card for @entity12 striker @entity92 in the 65th minute made a @entity76 comeback even less likely			0
and so it proved as @entity95 added a third three minutes after @entity92 departed			0
the win moves @entity72 up into second place in the group on nine points , which is enough for them to qualify for next year 's knockout phase			0

@entity133 halved the deficit four minutes into the second half thanks to a goal from striker @entity144 , but @entity133 fans were kept waiting until the 81st minute for the equalizer from @entity147			2
second half substitute @entity148 completed the turnaround when he converted an 84th minute penalty to put @entity133 within touching distance of the knockout phase			2
in the other @entity137 game , a 15th minute strike from @entity154 was enough to give @entity156 a 1 - 0 win over @entity158 .			0

a late brace from @entity8 striker @entity11 sinks @entity2 in @entity162
