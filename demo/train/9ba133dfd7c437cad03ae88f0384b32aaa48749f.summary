@entity0 -- two of the three suspects believed to be involved in a potential 9/11 anniversary plot against @entity0 or @entity5 are of @entity7 descent and traveled to the @entity8 last week , according to a @entity8 government official			1
authorities are operating under the assumption that two of the suspects have arrived on @entity8 soil , and have been piecing together clues gleaned from flight logs and manifests , among other sources , said the official , who declined to be named			1
a third plotter is believed to have been traveling in @entity22 , though it is not clear whether that person has arrived in the @entity8 , the official said			1
@entity8 spy networks had intercepted communications of an attack from an @entity28 operative in @entity29 , derived from a source who has provided accurate information in the past , official say			2
no other corroborating evidence of an attack has been uncovered , but it has prompted intelligence officials to sift through communications from other @entity28 cells			2
the information suggests the plan -- thought to involve a vehicle - borne explosive device -- is meant to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the september 11 attacks			2
the exact type of strike , however , is largley unclear and still remains unconfirmed			2
@entity8 officials rarely speak on the record about intelligence intercepts			2
and in the days following the raid on @entity52 's compound , officials indicated @entity28 had gone to great lengths to avoid having its communications intercepted by the @entity8			2
while the precise nature of communication intercepts is rarely discussed , @entity8 officials repeatedly have indicated their comfort with sharing the results of those intercepts			2
authorities also say they have picked up " chatter , " or widely divergent communications , from extremists that suggest the newly tapped @entity28 head , @entity65 , is in some way involved in the current plot			1
meanwhile , heightened security was visible saturday in @entity0 and @entity5 as intelligence officials worked to pin down information about the potential threat			1
a senior @entity8 official said the plot was believed to involve three individuals			1
it is believed to entail a vehicle bomb , but " we can not rule out other means , " the official said			1
@entity8 vice president @entity80 also weighed in friday , saying the information was at least in part gleaned from the may raid against @entity52 in @entity84 , @entity29			1
" this is the first ... credible piece of information we 've gotten , " @entity80 told @entity86 's " today " show			2
" all hands are on deck			0
" it is not clear how the @entity52 raid helped authorities connect the dots to the prospect of an anniversary attack , but @entity80 downplayed the threat of a widely sophisticated plot involving multiple conspirators			1
he said the administration 's principal concern is a plot from a " lone actor , not some extremely complicated plan like it took to take down the world trade ( center ) towers or the plane in @entity109 ( @entity110 ) or the @entity111			1
" he added , " it does n't mean they could n't happen , but it 's much less likely			0
the lone actor is the more worrisome thing because there are fewer trails to follow , there are fewer leads to move on			0
" on saturday morning , police officers stopped and searched box trucks as they approached the @entity123 , which links @entity124 with @entity0 , as well as the @entity125 , the @entity126 and the @entity127 , connecting the boroughs of @entity129 and @entity130			1
police also manned checkpoints in @entity133 and downtown @entity134 , where they examined vehicles , particularly vans and trucks , for possible bombs			1
@entity0 police also are sweeping parking garages for explosives and using digital license plate readers to check for stolen vehicles			1
@entity0 gov. @entity145 has directed state police and asked @entity147 to help secure areas during the anniversary weekend , bolstering an already heightened level of security			1
" we already had a great security plan in place , and in an abundance of caution , we 're deploying more resources , " he told reporters			1
" we should n't allow this threat to diminish the importance of the 9/11 anniversary , because that would be doing just what the terrorists want us to do			1
" a senior @entity8 administration official said friday that it is the " origin " of the intelligence information that is causing particular concern			0
@entity8 officials believe that operatives came out of the tribal @entity29 - @entity172 border region -- a volatile semi-lawless area that is home to extremist groups -- and that they are part of @entity28 " central			0
" the official also noted a possibility that @entity29 - based groups such as @entity179 or @entity180 could be involved			1
a senior @entity182 official said president @entity183 had been updated about the potential threat after his speech to a joint session of @entity187 on thursday night , and @entity182 counterterrorism adviser @entity188 briefed him again friday			0
no changes have been made to the president 's schedule for the weekend			0
@entity0 mayor @entity192 told reporters thursday night that while additional police will be deployed around the city , " there 's no reason for any of the rest of us to change ... our daily routines			1
" a joint intelligence bulletin issued by the @entity202 and the @entity203 on thursday indicated other methods than a truck or car bomb could be used , including attacks with small arms , homemade explosives and poisons			0
@entity28 probably would provide its operatives with enough autonomy to select the particular target and method of attack , the bulletin said , and an attack may involve operatives carrying @entity8 documentation			0
intelligence officials believe @entity28 " likely maintained an interest since at least february 2010 in conducting large attacks in the homeland timed to coincide with symbolic dates , to include the 10 - year anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , " according to the intelligence bulletin			1
@entity52 's death and the " removal " of senior @entity28 figures since then could add to the organization 's desire to stage an attack on a symbolic date such as september 11 , the bulletin said			0
in @entity5 , local officials said the city has a robust plan in place and has been on heightened alert since september 1			0
" i want to urge all of our citizens ... to remain calm and let our law enforcement professionals do their job			0
at the same time , we ask people to remain vigilant , " mayor @entity245 said			0
" if you see something , say something			0
" unattended vehicles around key infrastructure will be towed , @entity5 metropolitan police chief @entity250 said			2
federal officials said they are taking the threat seriously , while trying to temper the news by saying such threats are commonplace in connection with key dates			0
rep. @entity259 , @entity260 - @entity0 , chairman of the @entity261 , said specific details were revealed to lawmakers about the threat			0
" many agencies are looking at this from every possible angle , " he said			0
but it is not known yet if the threat is real , he said , adding , " i would tell people now to go about their lives			0
there 's no need to panic			0
" @entity1 's @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity279 , @entity280 , @entity281 , @entity282 , @entity283 and @entity284 contributed to this report .			0
