@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 president @entity3 condemned a suicide bombing monday at a military airfield , the latest incident in a spike in violence after the burning of @entity10 by @entity12 troops last week			1
at least nine people were killed and 12 wounded in the early - morning explosion near the front gate of the @entity12 - led @entity17 base at @entity18 in eastern @entity1 , according to gen. @entity19 , the provincial police chief			1
there were no @entity12 casualties			1
the @entity23 insurgency said the attack was in retaliation for the @entity27 burning and said it hoped the attacks will continue " with the anger of the public			1
" another attack of " some significance " was reported later monday in @entity34 province , near the @entity36 border , said @entity37			1
@entity38 , an @entity17 spokesman			1
a statement from the @entity23 said its fighters also attacked @entity42 troops and border police in southern @entity34 on monday evening , claiming to have inflicted a dozen deaths on the @entity42 and @entity1 force while losing five of their own			1
but @entity38 said that while some insurgent casualties had been reported , there were no deaths among allied troops			1
the qurans that were burned were among religious materials seized from a detainee facility at @entity54 last week			2
@entity42 president @entity55 apologized to @entity3 last week , calling the burning an inadvertent error			2
in a statement issued on the bombing monday , @entity3 condemned the " inhuman and un-islamic " act and urged that " the ruthless enemy would earn nothing but growing public hatred and punishment before @entity65 , the @entity66			2
" gen. @entity67 , commander of @entity12 and @entity42 forces in @entity1 , said insurgents tried to attack the @entity17 installation and failed , instead taking more innocent lives			1
the @entity23 also claimed monday to be behind the poisoning of food at a dining facility at @entity75 , near the @entity1 - @entity36 border			1
it too was a retaliatory attack , the group said			1
@entity17 confirmed that food at the base appeared to have been contaminated over the weekend , though it was unclear whether it was deliberate			1
a dining facility worker came to his leaders at the @entity85 and said that something had been poisoned , " said maj. @entity82 , an @entity17 spokesman			1
" the dining facility was shut down , and we brought in environmental health , who found traces of chlorine bleach in the coffee and fruit			0
soldiers are now eating pre-prepared rations , and no one was affected			0
there is a full investigation that is narrowing down who was responsible			0
" capt. @entity101 , a @entity102 spokesman in @entity0 , said it 's not clear whether the incident was a deliberate attempt to poison troops or " was just inadvertent , perhaps using more @entity107 in the cleaning process than they should have			0
" the @entity23 has frequently exaggerated its claims or claimed responsibility for attacks that later turned out to be the work of another group			0
even so , monday 's bombing and news of the contaminated food come on the heels of a week of violent protests over the @entity27 burning			1
the violence has left at least 39 people dead , including four @entity42 soldiers , and hundreds more wounded			1
in northern @entity126 over the weekend , protesters attacked a police chief 's office and a @entity42 military base , authorities said			1
some threw hand grenades at the base , known as @entity133 , with resulting blasts wounding seven @entity42 personnel believed to be @entity137 members , they said			1
demonstrations outside the @entity140 office in @entity126 on saturday left four civilians dead and prompted the @entity140 mission there to say monday that it is temporarily relocating its international staff			0
two @entity42 soldiers were gunned down last week at a base in eastern @entity1 by a man wearing an @entity150 uniform			2
@entity67 pulled military advisers from @entity1 ministries after saturday 's shooting deaths of two other @entity42 officers inside the heavily secure @entity155			0
authorities are searching for the suspect , identified by @entity1 police as a junior officer in the ministry 's intelligence department			0
the suspect had been fired by the @entity163 but rejoined the intelligence services as a driver a couple of months ago , a senior @entity1 counterterrorism official said monday			2
" we do not know how he was allowed into the office , as the command and control center requires a password for access , " said the official , who is not authorized to speak to the media about the topic			2
" there is something fishy there			0
" the official said he believed that the gunman used a silencer on his weapon , as no one heard the gunshots			2
he said he doubts that an angry exchange led to the shooting , because the " way he entered was not accidental			0
" @entity101 said it 's not clear whether the shooting was linked the the @entity27 burning			0
" we do n't know what the motivation was behind the murders , and we do n't know all the facts surrounding how this individual got into this space and frankly was able to get out as quickly and apparently as easily as he did , " @entity101 said monday			0
@entity67 has told his commanders he will not authorize the return of personnel to @entity1 ministries until new security measures are in place and working , according to an official who has access to the latest intelligence and is involved in administration discussions but declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the situation			2
the religious materials , including @entity10 , were removed from a detainee center library at @entity54 because they had " extremist inscriptions " on them and there was " an appearance that these documents were being used to facilitate extremist communications , " a military official said			2
the ensuing attacks have put pressure on already strained @entity42 - @entity1 relations at a time when the @entity42 is working to reduce troop levels and transition security as part of its plan to withdraw by 2014			0
@entity102 officials on monday acknowledged the significance of the attacks but denied they are affecting the @entity42 or @entity12 mission there			1
" these events , they 're troubling			0
they 've gotten everybody 's attention , " @entity101 said			0
" yes , tension is high here in @entity0 right now , but across the country at large , the mission continues , and we 're seeing the protest activity decline			0
" the number of protests in @entity1 has gone from 24 on saturday to three on monday , only two of which were because of the @entity27 burning , @entity101 said			0
@entity2 's @entity247 and @entity248 contributed to this report .			0
