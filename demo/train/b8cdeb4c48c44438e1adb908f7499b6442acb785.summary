@entity0 -- speaking from @entity0 on tuesday , @entity3 secretary of state @entity2 said last week 's deadly shooting there was an act of terrorism , and the @entity3 is taking steps to counter extremist groups including @entity11 online , which has sought to recruit and radicalize @entity12 to its cause			1
" there are a great many avenues here , all of which are being structured within the confines of an overall strategy , " @entity2 said of @entity3 efforts , " but we will leave no effort untested with respect to our efforts to shut down the ability of these people to propagandize , to lie , to deceive , and to have whatever influence they may be able to have on young minds			1
" both @entity28 and the @entity3 have seen dozens of their citizens leave @entity31 in recent months to join militant groups on the battlefield in @entity34			1
just last week , three teenagers from @entity37 were stopped from leaving the @entity3 with the intent of joining @entity11 , law enforcement officials said			0
and the terror group has featured fighters with @entity31 accents in recent propaganda videos			0
the @entity3 and @entity28 also share concerns about the prospect of more so - called " lone wolf " attacks like the one in @entity0 last week			2
the shooter , @entity48 , was only the latest in a string of young @entity51 men , often converts to @entity52 with criminal backgrounds , who have become radicalized by extremist messaging and who sought to commit attacks			0
just a few days before @entity48 opened fire at a war memorial and @entity59 , another @entity28 man rammed his car into two @entity28 soldiers , killing one of them			0
and following the @entity0 attack , an @entity31 man , @entity65 , attacked four @entity67 police officers with a hatchet before he was shot dead			0
@entity67 police said @entity65 was a self - radicalized convert to @entity52 , and they categorized the assault as a terrorist attack			0
the ability of groups like @entity11 to influence and recruit @entity12 online is one of the capabilities the @entity3 and @entity28 governments hope to disrupt			2
during his visit , @entity2 also laid a wreath at the @entity79 where @entity48 gunned down army reservist cpl. @entity80 on wednesday , before continuing on to a nearby @entity82 building where he ultimately was shot and killed			0
@entity2 's trip , happening the same day @entity80 was laid to rest , gave the @entity86 administration another opportunity to express solidarity with the @entity28 people in the aftermath of the attack			2
" president @entity86 , the @entity92 and our entire administration pledge to work even more closely with your leaders at every level in order to deter and prevent terrorist attacks , " @entity2 said			1
@entity2 also had a message for @entity11 and other terrorist groups			1
" the question that our adversaries want us to ask is ' is there nowhere safe ? ' " @entity2 said			0
" and that is a question to which we firmly reply : no. " there is nowhere safe for those who would pervert the teachings of a great religion , murder the innocent , betray their neighbors , and line up on the side of such pernicious groups as ( @entity11 ) and @entity115			1
" this is @entity2 's first trip to @entity28 as secretary of state .			1

secretary of state @entity2 is on his first official trip to @entity28
he has a message for terrorist groups , and efforts to *thwart* their recruiting
no place is safe for those who " pervert the teachings of a great religion , murder the innocent "
@entity2 pledges the @entity3 will work " even more closely " with @entity28 to prevent terrorism
