-- it was like any other day			2
if anything , it might have been a little better than usual -- with more deserved honors for the kids , more jokes and songs , more smiles			1
even @entity10 , after storms the previous day , seemed at first to cooperate as the sun shone brightly			2
and in @entity14 , where adults and children alike habitually practice what to do if a tornado strikes , change can prove deadly			1
things are different , more heartbreaking now for students and staff at @entity22 and @entity24 elementary schools in @entity25 , both of them leveled by a tornado			1
" a lot of pain , a lot of tears , very little food and very little sleep is the way you get through it , " @entity22 principal @entity28 said friday			1
they are not just of the horrible moments when the twister tore through their schools , but the minutes before as teachers did what they could to keep their students safe and in control as it approached , the short time before that as frenzied parents rushed in looking for their sons and daughters , and the hours before that when everything seemed perfect			1
" what started off as a normal day at @entity22 tuned into a horrible , horrible thing for seven families , " said @entity28 , referring to the seven of her students killed by the storm			1
inside a tornado - ravaged school a frenzied , yet controlled few horrific minutes each school week at @entity22 starts with " @entity62			1
" it 's a chance for students to see their teachers and counselors , to sing and recite the school creed , and to honor youngsters ' accomplishments inside and outside school			1
" during that morning meeting , we celebrate kids , " the school 's principal said			1
on monday , the celebrations did n't end there			1
@entity28 recalled then heading to an hour - long award ceremony for first and second graders to toast their many achievements , then to a practice for sixth - graders ' commencement exercises			1
after that , kids started filing into the cafeteria for the first of six lunch sessions the school has			2
" everything in the morning went exactly as it has for the last 170 days , " @entity28 recalled			1
it was after lunch that teachers first got word to be on alert for severe weather			2
still , at that point , no one knew a twister was heading their way			2
@entity28 continued to go about her business , interviewing a candidate for a pre-kindergarten position , when she noticed heavy thunderstorms roll through			2
a balm after the storm @entity28 ended the interview and noticed parents starting to stream in to pick up their kids			0
this happens often when it rains heavily , but the principal sensed something abnormal was up as parents rushed in faster and in greater numbers than usual			1
" at that point , i made a decision that you did n't have to check out your child the formal way , " @entity28 recalled , saying she stood out front to see who was coming and going			0
some parents were noticeably scared			0
one father , @entity28 said , was " in a panic			0
" she told him that he had to calm down -- so as not to alarm any students -- before he went through the hallways to retrieve his child			1
this steady stream lasted 5 or 6 minutes before the sirens went off , indicating a tornado on the ground			1
@entity28 got on the intercom and told everyone to do what they 'd practiced in all those drills			1
then she walked up and down the hallways			0
( she could n't get to where her second and third - graders were , however , as they were in a different building			0
) some teachers tracked the twister on mobile devices , until @entity28 asked them to turn them off			0
she did another walk - through and saw her staffers rubbing the backs of their students , some of whom -- with their heads down and hands over their heads -- sang			1
when the principal got back to the front of the school , the tornado was nearly on top of them			1
she got on the intercom one more time			1
" just doing their jobs ? teachers save lives during tornado rising from the rubble @entity28 huddled in a bathroom with four other women			1
" the only time i yelled ( i said ) , ' in @entity172 's name , go away , go away			1
' i said it about four times			0
" debris was still flying when @entity28 pushed out the door , stepped over a sink , and noticed " the whole neighborhood was gone			0
" somehow , her phone rang			0
it was her mother , and she told her to call 911			1
there were no more walls left in her school			0
the bumper of a car sat between the pre-kindergarten and kindergarten students			1
" i could see the kids peeking around what used to be a corner , " @entity28 said			0
@entity192 , a fifth - grade teacher who was the first to spot the twister , was the first one out on one side of what had been the school			1
men and women , meanwhile , were running foward to help			0
within minutes , @entity28 recalled , the pre-k , kindergarten and first graders were safely out			0
her husband soon arrived and put his hand on her shoulder			0
" i said , ' go help second and third grade , ' " referring to those students who were in a different , nearby building			1
" i have n't seen any of them yet			0
" more and more students emerged , some of them heading to a nearby church			1
but what had been the second - and third - grade building was precarious , at best			0
" i made my way around there , then i begged and pleaded for the human chain to get me up there , " @entity28 said			0
and they were pulling out students and teachers			2
" all seven killed at @entity22 died in that rubble			2
" the rest of the evening was a nightmare			0
" one block , two tornadoes : life in the crosshairs ' they grew up really fast ' @entity24 elementary principal @entity232 's first impression of monday ? " i remember thinking , " yeah , it 's sunny ! so we 're going to be able to go outside			1
" @entity235 started , as it always does , with what 's called the @entity237 -- a time for singing , dancing , celebrating			2
" ( i remember ) the happy faces , how excited they were , just seeing them smile , " said @entity240			0
and there was laughter when a special guest -- a sheep -- made a special appearance			0
staffers had to give it a kiss , because a group of students had reached their reading goal			2
lunchtime that day was especially fun			0
" this is what school is about , " @entity240 remembered saying at the time			2
" this is why we do what we do			0
" the next few hours went by in a blur -- in some ways , much like at @entity22			0
there were the students and staff doing what they 'd practiced in tornado drills -- the sirens , and more			1
@entity240 felt stronger , more resolute this time than when the last @entity270 tornado -- the strongest such classification -- came through @entity25			1
when that happened , she was alone and horrified			0
she had a sense of purpose , beyond simply making sure they survived			0
" i have 675 students that i promise their parents every single day , i will protect your kids , " @entity240 said			2
" i 'll feed them , they 'll be safe , and i 'll give them back at the end of the day			0
" @entity286 did n't survive the tornado , but everyone who had been inside did			2
they included 4 - year - olds and students set to move onto seventh grade , though they were still kids at heart			2
yet on monday , one of them reached down to a teacher , who was trapped in the rubble with water from a busted pipe blowing in her face			1
" he grabbed her hand and said , ' calm down , i 'm going to dig you out			2
" and he did , just a few days after letting loose during a " @entity305 " party			0
" here they were , being silly on friday night , ... dancing , being sixth - graders , " @entity240 said			0
" they grew up really fast			0
" graduations provide respite from tragedy			0
