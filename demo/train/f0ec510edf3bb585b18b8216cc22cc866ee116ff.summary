-- @entity1 has released satellite photos that show the extent of @entity5 's military mobilization on its border with @entity7 -- including fighter jets , tanks , artillery and thousands of soldiers who are prepared to invade within 12 hours if called upon , say officials			1
the photos appear to confirm @entity16 leaders ' fears that @entity5 may be preparing for a ground invasion of eastern @entity7 , despite @entity1 's call for @entity5 to withdraw its forces from the border			1
what do the photos show ? the photos , which private satellite imaging firm @entity24 says it took between march 22 and april 2 , purportedly reveal dozens of @entity5 " fast jets , " helicopters and infantry units that were not spotted in photos of the same areas last year			1
@entity1 estimates there are up to 40,000 troops massed at various locations along the @entity7 border , and says it has spotted @entity5 forces at more than 100 different sites			1
the photos of military equipment and infantry personnel should be greater cause for concern than the ones of the fighter jets , according to experts who have examined the photos for @entity0			2
the photos of tanks , artillery battalions , and infantry brigades near @entity51 -- just 50 kilometers from the @entity7 border -- show @entity5 's preparation for a potential invasion , says @entity54 , a research fellow for @entity5 studies at @entity56 , a defense and security think tank			1
another photo shows more than a dozen @entity60 or @entity62 attack helicopters sitting in a sparse air field at @entity64 , a @entity5 facility just 40 kilometers from the @entity7 border			1
" moving these helicopters closer to the operational area would make sense in the event of an invasion , " @entity54 says			0
another photo purportedly shows a build - up of @entity5 @entity72 , @entity73 , and @entity75 fighter jets at the formerly vacant @entity77 air base , 150 kilometers from the @entity7 border			1
@entity54 says the recent build - up of these jets in what appear to be sparsely resourced air fields does n't make much sense from a strategic standpoint			0
" the planes seem to be more about parade than about preparation , " he says			0
" firstly , they 're designed to fly hundreds of kilometers anyway , so moving them another 90 kilometers closer to the border wo n't make much difference			0
" he added : " if the @entity5 do not have installations to service the planes , or utilize weapons storages , and if they 're far from their permanent bases where their rear - support units are concentrated , they can not be operationally effective for an invasion			0
" why has @entity1 released the photos now ? are they exaggerating the threat ? @entity104 , an associate fellow at the @entity105 think tank , says there must be serious cause for alarm for @entity1 to have released the photos			2
" you have to assume that there have been behind the scenes consultations between @entity5 and @entity1 , but obviously those have been limited in effectiveness for @entity1 to release this kind of imagery , which it would not normally do , " @entity104 says			1
" should we trust @entity1 on this ? yes , because it has no interest whatsoever in exacerbating the situation			0
this is a crisis which they 're trying to play down wherever possible and make it clear it 's not involved			0
" @entity104 also says that the @entity5 military officers he regularly speaks with have suddenly gone silent			1
" one possible explanation is that they 've been told to curtail contact with foreigners , " he says			0
" and if that is the reason , whenever that 's happened in the past , it has not been a good sign			0
" what is @entity5 saying about the photos ? a @entity5 military official told @entity137 that the photos were taken in august of last year during military drills -- a claim @entity1 called " categorically false " in a statement friday			1
" this is a force that 's very capable at high readiness , " @entity143 brigadier @entity142 said at a briefing at @entity1 military headquarters in @entity146 , @entity147 on thursday			2
" and as we 've illustrated through the imagery , it 's close to routes and lines of communications and it has the resources to be able to move quickly into @entity7 if it was ordered to do so			0
" could @entity5 really invade @entity7 in 12 hours ? while many of the @entity5 troops are 50 kilometers or more from @entity7 's border , some are just 6 - 7 kilometers away , according to @entity56 's @entity54			1
" in one hour some of these troops could be on the @entity7 side , though for others it will take longer , " he says			0
one of key aims of the @entity5 military transformation effort since 2008 , according to @entity105 's @entity104 , was to create " permanent readiness units " that need just an hour to move if required			1
" what we 're seeing on the border does n't necessarily mean @entity5 is preparing to invade , " he says , " but it would seem to mean that @entity5 wishes to be fully prepared to launch an invasion if @entity173 sees that it 's necessary			2
" what is @entity1 saying by releasing the photos ? @entity54 says @entity1 is trying to show the @entity182 that even the slightest move now will provoke a disproportionally severe reaction			2
" @entity1 is telling @entity5 : ' look , we are serious and we mean business			2
we 're not going to keep silent over any of your moves , so you better just pull back			0
