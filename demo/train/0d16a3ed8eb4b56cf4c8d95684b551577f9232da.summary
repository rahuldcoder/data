-- @entity1 will probably be incarcerated for the rest of his life for child sex abuse convictions , but the former @entity6 assistant football coach is making sure he has his say outside the prison walls			1
documentary filmmaker @entity9 interviewed @entity1 , 68 , for a project he calls " @entity11 of @entity12			1
" on monday , @entity14 's " today " show aired a portion of a phone conversation between the two men			1
in the broadcast excerpts , @entity1 questioned the credibility of prosecution witness @entity20 , another former @entity6 assistant coach , who testified that he walked in on @entity1 raping a child in the showers at a school facility			1
" i think there 's a lot of things that transpired			0
i think these investigators , the way they went about business , you know , his story changed a lot			0
i think he said some things , and then it escalated on him , " @entity1 said			2
" i do n't understand how anybody would have walked into that locker room from where he was and heard sounds associated that was sex going on			0
( laughter ) you know , like he said that could 've been , i mean , there was ... that would have been the last thing i would have thought about			0
i would 've thought maybe fooling around or something like that			0
( laughter ) " @entity1 also discussed what @entity12 , the legendary @entity6 head coach who was forced out as a result of the scandal , knew -- or did n't know			1
@entity12 family : @entity59 report ' factually wrong ' " if he absolutely thought i was ( a pedophile ) , i 'd say no. if he had a suspicion , i do n't know the answer to that , " @entity1 said			1
@entity9 wrote an open letter to the media on sunday , and said on the " today " show that " the media , in this particular case , has an agenda			2
they do n't want to hear what the truth is			0
this has been a rush to judgment from the very beginning			0
" " @entity1 had his day in court			1
i am trying to get @entity12 , effectively , his day in court , " @entity9 said , later adding , " this is all about @entity12 's alleged culpability , which i do n't believe the facts back up			1
i think he was railroaded			0
" both @entity6 and the @entity12 family lambasted @entity1 and the release of his audio			1
" @entity1 's statements today continue to open wounds for his victims , and the victims of child sexual abuse everywhere			1
we have tremendous respect for the men who came forward to tell their stories publicly , " said @entity6 spokesman @entity89			2
' the @entity1 8 ' describe seduction , molestation and betrayal and @entity12 family attorney @entity98 released a statement saying , " the release of the audio recording of @entity1 is a sad and unfortunate development			1
@entity1 had the opportunity to speak , under oath , during his trial and he chose not to do so			2
releasing a recording at this time , nearly a year after he was found guilty on 45 counts , is transparently self - serving and yet another insult to the victims and anyone who cares about the truth in this tragic story			0
" the @entity12 family would prefer to remain silent on this matter , but they feel it is important to make it clear that they had no role in obtaining or releasing this recording			2
moreover , they believe that any attempt to use this recording as a defense of @entity12 is misguided and inappropriate			2
i encourage anyone who wants to understand the facts of this case to go to @entity129 and read the reports of former attorney general @entity131 , former @entity133 profiler , @entity134 , noted pedophilia expert , dr. @entity136 and the @entity137 and @entity139 legal team			0
" from the beginning , the family has been committed to due process and a careful , objective examination of the facts			0
this is the path they will continue to follow			0
" @entity1 was sentenced in october to 30 to 60 years in prison for abusing 10 boys during a 15 - year period			1
on february 21 , he filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence with the @entity153 , according to court records			0
letters by @entity1 , wife blame everyone else @entity0 's @entity158 and @entity159 contributed to this report			2
