@entity0 -- the word " terrorism " in the @entity12 usually brings to mind plots linked in some way to @entity4 , while the danger posed to the public by white supremacists , anti-abortion extremists and other right - wing militants is often overlooked			1
militants linked to @entity4 or inspired by jihadist ideology have carried out four terrorist attacks in the @entity12 since september 11 , which have resulted in 17 deaths			2
thirteen of them were in a shooting incident at @entity21 , @entity22 , in november 2009			0
by contrast , right - wing extremists have committed at least eight lethal terrorist attacks in the @entity12 that have resulted in the deaths of nine people since 9/11 , according to data compiled by the @entity29			1
and if , after investigation , sunday 's attack on the @entity34 temple in @entity35 is included in this count , the death toll from right - wing terrorism in the @entity12 over the past decade rises to 15			1
the shooting suspect , @entity38 , posed with a @entity40 flag on his @entity42 page and has played a prominent role in " white power " music groups			0
the @entity46 is investigating the case as a " domestic terrorist - type incident			2
" a particular concern for law enforcement is the @entity52 movement , whose adherents reject all @entity12 laws as well as taxation and @entity12 currency			0
an @entity46 report published in 2011 said " lone - offender sovereign - citizen extremists have killed six law enforcement officers " since 2000			2
the numbers in the @entity29 database may well understate the toll of violence from right - wing extremists			1
another @entity46 study reported that between january 1 , 2007 , and october 31 , 2009 , white supremacists were involved in 53 acts of violence , 40 of which were assaults directed primarily at african - americans , seven of which were murders and the rest of which were threats , arson and intimidation			0
most of these were treated as racially motivated crimes rather than political acts of violence , i.e. terrorism			0
in the past year , the @entity46 has concluded investigations into a number of right - wing extremists , in some cases securing lengthy sentences for violent plots			1
in december , @entity92 of @entity93 , @entity0 , was sentenced to 32 years for planting a bomb at the site of a @entity97 parade			0
city workers found the bag containing the bomb an hour before the streets filled with parade - goers			0
after 9/11 , there was great concern that @entity4 or an allied group would launch a terrorist attack involving chemical , biological , radiological or nuclear ( @entity110 ) weapons			2
but in the past decade , there is no evidence that jihadist extremists in the @entity12 have acquired or attempted to acquire material to construct @entity110 weapons			2
by contrast , 11 right - wing and left - wing extremists have managed to acquire @entity110 material that they planned to use against the public , government employees or both			1
not included in those numbers were four elderly @entity124 men who were arrested in november , accused of plotting to produce the deadly toxin ricin , which they wanted to throw out of a car window as they drove along a highways in the eastern and southern @entity12			0
the government says that one of the men , @entity131 , was recorded by an informant as saying , " there is no way for us , as militiamen , to save this country , to save @entity124 , without doing something that 's highly , highly illegal : murder			0
" right - wing extremist individuals over the past decade in the @entity12 were as likely to use violence as a means to express their political or social beliefs as those motivated by @entity146 's ideology			1
even more worryingly , during the same time period , right - wing and left - wing extremist groups and individuals have been far more likely to acquire toxins and to assemble the makings of radiological weapons than @entity4 sympathizers .			1

@entity46 is investigating shootings at @entity34 temple as act of domestic terrorism
**authors** : @entity4 gets more attention ; right - wing extremist terrorists pose a deadly threat
since 9/11 , @entity12 has had more incidents of right - wing extremist terrorism than jihadi ones
**authors** : right - wing , left - wing extremists more likely to *obtain* chemical , biological , radiological weapons
