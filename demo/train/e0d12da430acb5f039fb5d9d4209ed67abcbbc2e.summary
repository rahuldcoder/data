-- an @entity2 mother who sent her gay son to school with a stun gun after administrators apparently did n't do enough to stop the bullying against him said she would do it again -- even though the teen now faces expulsion			1
" i do not promote violence -- not at all -- but what is a parent to do when she has done everything that she felt she was supposed to do ... at the school ? " the mother , @entity16 , told @entity0 's @entity11 on sunday			1
" i did feel like there was nothing else left for me to do , but protect my child			2

he raised it in the air , setting off an electric charge , and sending the group scurrying , @entity23 said			1
unlike a @entity39 , which fire barbs attached to long wires at a target , a stun gun has to be near or pressed against a person to shock them			0
" i got kicked out of school for me bringing the weapon to school , but i honestly do n't think that that was fair , " @entity23 said			1
" i did n't use it on nobody			0

@entity23 is known as a flamboyant dresser and @entity66 , the @entity67 principal , said school staff had been trying to get him to " tone down " his accessories			1
" if you wear female apparel , then kids are kids and they 're going to say whatever it is that they want to say , " @entity66 told @entity70			0
" because you want to be different and because you choose to wear female apparel , it may happen			0
in the idealistic society , it should n't matter			0
people should be able to wear what they want to wear			0
" @entity0 could not immediately reach school officials for comment			0
@entity16 contends that school officials have n't done enough to protect all students on campus			1

it a common complaint among lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender students			2
a 2009 survey of 7,261 middle and high school students found that nearly nine out of 10 @entity103 students had experienced harassment at school over the previous year and nearly two - thirds felt unsafe because of their sexual orientation			1
