@entity0 , @entity1 -- a century ago , the rise of @entity4 and the fear it created in @entity7 led to world war			1
some analysts predict a similar fate from the rise of @entity12 and the fear that is creating in the @entity13			1
one should be skeptical about such dire projections			0
by 1900 , @entity4 had surpassed @entity7 in industrial power , and @entity17 was pursuing an adventurous , globally oriented foreign policy that was bound to bring about a clash with other great powers			1
in contrast , @entity12 still lags far behind the @entity13 economically and militarily , and has focused its policies primarily on its region and on its economic development			1
while its " market leninist " economic model ( the so - called " @entity27 " ) provides soft power in authoritarian countries , it has the opposite effect in many democracies			2
soft power is the ability to produce preferred outcomes by attraction rather than coercion or payment , and @entity12 has announced major efforts to increase its soft power			1
watch an interview with @entity40 even if @entity12 's gross domestic product passes that of the @entity13 around 2030 ( as @entity44 projects ) , the two economies would be equivalent in size , but not equal in composition			1
@entity12 would still have a vast underdeveloped countryside , and it will begin to face demographic problems from the delayed effects of the one child per couple policy it enforced in the 20th century			0
moreover , as countries develop , there is a tendency for growth rates to slow			0
@entity57 : @entity59 's rise ... how and when assuming a 6 percent @entity12 growth and only 2 percent @entity13 growth after 2030 , @entity12 would not equal the @entity13 in per capita income until sometime in the second half of the century			1
@entity12 is a long way from posing the kind of challenge to @entity13 that the kaiser 's @entity4 posed when it passed @entity7 at the beginning of the last century			1
unlike @entity69 , which was born with a democratic constitution , @entity12 has not yet found a way to solve the problem of demands for political participation ( if not democracy ) that tend to accompany rising per capita income			0
the ideology of communism is long gone , and the legitimacy of the ruling party depends upon economic growth and ethnic @entity84 nationalism			0
premier @entity85 talks of reform but faces conservative resistance			0
the @entity12 political system suffers from a high level of corruption , and should the economy falter , it is vulnerable to political unrest			0
whether @entity12 can develop a formula that can manage an expanding urban middle class , regional inequality , and resentment among ethnic minorities remains to be seen			0
@entity99 has been anointed the likely next leader ( in 2012 ) , but not even he knows how @entity12 's political future will evolve			2
the current generation of @entity12 leaders , realizing that rapid economic growth is the key to domestic political stability , has focused on economic development and what they call a " harmonious " international environment that will not disrupt their country 's growth			0
but generations change , power often creates hubris , and appetites sometimes grow with eating			0
already , some younger party members and military men argue that @entity12 's success in recovery from the global financial crisis should lead to a greater political role			2
and the @entity13 objected last summer when @entity12 defined its " core interests " as including the distant waters of the @entity125			2
@entity57 : why nations should pursue " soft power " whatever @entity12 intentions are , it is doubtful that @entity12 will have the military capability to expel the @entity13 from @entity59			1
the region has its own internal balance of powers , and in that context , many states welcome an @entity13 presence in the region			2
@entity12 leaders will have to contend with the reactions of other countries as well as the constraints created by their own objectives of economic growth and the need for external markets and resources			0
too aggressive a @entity12 military posture could produce a countervailing coalition among its neighbors that would weaken both its hard and soft power			1
@entity12 's recent overreaction to a maritime collision near the disputed @entity153 led to a hardening of attitudes in @entity156			1
a recent @entity158 poll of 16 countries around the world found a positive attitude towards @entity12 's economic rise , but not its military rise			1
the fact that @entity12 is not likely to become a peer competitor to the @entity13 on a global basis does not mean that the dangers of conflict in @entity59 can be completely ruled out			2
but given the global challenges such as financial stability , cybersecurity , and climate change that both @entity12 and the @entity13 will face , they have much to gain from working together			2
unfortunately , hubris and nationalism among some @entity12 and unnecessary fear of decline among some @entity13 make it difficult to assure this future			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity40 .			0

@entity40 , who *coined* term " soft power , " says @entity12 's power is far behind that of @entity13
he says rise of @entity4 a century ago *threatened* @entity7 , led to world war
@entity40 says @entity12 's focus has been on its own region
he says @entity12 has major internal and external challenges to *overcome*
