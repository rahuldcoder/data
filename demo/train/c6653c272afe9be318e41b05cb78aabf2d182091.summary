they questioned why such weapons are available and why anyone would need them			0
" personally i do n't know how any ordinary citizen can justify owning an automatic or semiautomatic gun , " writes @entity0 commenter @entity18			1
" ca n't we leave those guns to the trained military ? " self - described gun owner @entity27 comments , " i ... fully support a ban on rapid - fire weapons			1

@entity44 was one of more than 100 gun enthusiasts who shared opinions on @entity48 about owning firearms that would have been banned under the now - expired 1994 federal weapons ban			2
" sure , i could try to say that the reason i own these guns is self - defense , but the truth of the matter is that , although they will technically serve this purpose , they are not why i own them , " he says			2
@entity61 gun owner @entity60 describes his enthusiasm for his rifle more succinctly , saying , " i like to shoot , and that is one heck of a fun carbine to plink with			1
" @entity48 : tell us why you own your military - style weapon background can factor into a gun owner 's choice of weapon			1

@entity48 : why some own military - style weapons ' a part of history ' " since coming of age -- and in the decades since -- i have collected many different firearms , some of them historical pieces , some for sport , some of them even the so - called ' assault weapons ' that are now a controversy , " says @entity141			1
" guns like these are as much a part of the history of this country as the muskets carried by pioneers , the rifles toted by doughboys in the trenches , and the other arms that have served and protected throughout the years			0
to hold one in your hands , appreciate its history and design , and to be able to take that piece of history to the range and work -- it is a feeling that many people in this debate do not understand or appreciate			0

rifles are generally easier to learn how to shoot , say military - style rifle owners			1
like most firearms , military - style weapons such as the @entity9 are semiautomatic -- increasing protection because the shooter can fire off many shots without having to manually chamber a new bullet			1
with a bolt - action rifle or pump - action shotgun , firing multiple shots takes more time			2
" when you weigh it all out , these types of guns are stigmatized , " says @entity84			0
military - style weapons look more dangerous than other guns , he says , but really , there are many weapons available which are just as lethal , but which are not designed in a military style			1
