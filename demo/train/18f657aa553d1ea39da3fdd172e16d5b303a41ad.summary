-- sunday is the series finale of " @entity2			1
" for the past six seasons of " @entity2 , " every single episode has brought us at least one new oddity to ponder			1
and yet , as frequently as questions are posed , it 's not that often a question is actually answered			2
this is why the love the show , but also what makes it such an ever - evolving mind bender			2
now we are down to the final episode			2
it 's a long one -- two and a half hours to be exact -- but it has all us fans wondering , how the heck are they going to tie up all the loose ends ? sadly , they wo n't			2
today , producers @entity22 and @entity24 announced that because they felt they did n't have enough time to finish all the story lines , the season six dvd will contain 20 extra minutes			1
but , um , we do n't want to wait until august or have to drop $ 50 to know everything ! so , guys , here are 10 questions we need the answers to on sunday			0
mmm - k ? the @entity0 : 11 most romantic ( and hawt ) " lost " clips 1			0
what the heck is the island ? so many different theories have been presented by different characters this season			1
is the island a cork on a wine bottle of evil that keeps the darkness from spilling out into the regular world , as suggested by @entity43 ? is the island hell and everyone on it is dead , as @entity46 told @entity47 ? or is it a hiding place for the world 's life source , as @entity43 and the @entity53 's mother proposed ? or is it something else entirely ? 2			0
what 's up with that white light ? @entity43 has been tasked with guarding the white light for forever , and in this week 's episode , @entity59 volunteered to take over the job -- which makes sense , as @entity43 tells him that the light is near the bamboo field where he awoke in the show 's first seconds			1
but , uh , what is the light exactly ? and whom does it need to be protected from ? the @entity0 : the 5 most kick - butt scenes in " @entity2 " 3			1
why are the characters ' lives in the " sideways " universe different from what they were before the crash ? all season , we 've been getting flashes to an alternate reality where flight 815 never crashes and lands safely in @entity83			1
some of the characters ' lives match up with what we 've seen in flashbacks to their lives before the crash			0
but most are way different -- for example , @entity59 has a son , @entity89 has a loving fiancé , and @entity94 appears to be a bad guy ( maybe ? ) pulling strings and making puppets dance			1
speaking of , what is @entity94 's function in all this ? last episode , we found out that @entity94 is a " fail safe			0
" and we 've known for a while now that , somehow , he survived the electromagnetic explosion of the hatch			0
is @entity94 super-powered ? because of the explosion , or has the island always been his destiny too ? how will he play into whatever is coming ? the @entity0 : 8 things i will not miss about " lost " going away 5			0
what about the polar bears ? in the series pilot , @entity115 shoots and kills a polar bear			0
we know that the @entity119 kept them in the cages -- but did they bring them ? or were they already there ? 6			0
why ca n't women have babies on the island ? another question that goes seasons back with no explanation			1
why was @entity131 able to give birth to @entity133 and @entity43 and the @entity53 's mother able to give birth to them -- but all other women on the island are unable to have babies ? 7			1
how will @entity59 try to kill the @entity53 ? when @entity59 took over for @entity43 , @entity43 said @entity59 must " do what he could n't -- kill him			1
" so how exactly does one go about killing a lethal cloud of black smok ? guess we 'll have to find out			0
the @entity0 : they were " lost " on a remote island , but still stylish ? 8			0
how is @entity43 still conversing with the candidates when he is dead ? in last year 's season finale , the @entity53 convinced @entity148 to kill @entity43			2
so , uh , how is @entity43 sitting around a campfire explaining to the candidates how he picked each of them because they had no ties , led miserable existences , and were alone in the world ? 9			0
what 's up with @entity59 's neck wound ? in the sideways universe , @entity59 has a wound on his neck that keeps reopening for no apparent reason			1
this has me a little nervous			0
i 'm worried that in the final showdown between @entity59 and the @entity53 , @entity59 might not come out alive			1
if his throat gets slashed , it would explain that detail in the sideways reality			0
why was the island underwater ? remember back in the season premiere when the island was shown totally submerged underwater ? why ? how ? when ? is that the end result of whatever battle is coming ? @entity175 all rights reserved			2

the " @entity2 " season six dvd will contain 20 extra minutes
why was @entity131 able to give birth , but the other women are not ?
@entity59 has a wound on his neck that keeps reopening for no apparent reason
