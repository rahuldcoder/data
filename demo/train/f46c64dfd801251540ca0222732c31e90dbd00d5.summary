-- as @entity3 emerges from her comatose state , she mistakes the man at her bedside , her husband @entity5 , for a doctor			0
you realize @entity3 has no memory of her life with @entity5 -- not their marriage , their love , nor their " vow			0
" and that 's when it happens : tears ready behind your eyes			0
before you know it , they 've rolled down your cheeks and into your popcorn			0
from " @entity25 " and " @entity26 " to " the vow , " which opens in theaters today , @entity24 has long sought to cash in at the box office by tugging at viewers ' heartstrings			1
and while some moviegoers will buy tickets to a poignant love story looking for a sort of cathartic experience , @entity32 , a professor of media studies at @entity34 , says it 's unclear if movies actually serve such a purpose			1
people certainly go to the movie theater with the intention of having a good cry and letting out certain emotions , @entity43 said			1
however , she added , there are many reasons why films make people feel better , and the movie itself might not even be one of them			2
" a lot of it has to do with who you 're watching the movie with , " @entity43 said			2
" if i go to the movies with my best friend , and we cry all over each other and comfort one another , i end up feeling better			2
but really , it was ... the support my friend gave me that made me feel better			0
but i attribute it to the movie			2
" while movies might not actually make viewers feel better , they do " allow us to experience strong emotions in safe places , " said @entity70 , an associate professor specializing in mass media effects at @entity72			1
" good writers and producers know how to arrange the elements of the film to hold you in a non-critical experience state where you are engaged with the main character , and that character 's experience , " @entity78 said			2
" done well , you experience the main character 's emotions along with her			1
" and there 's a reason why movies make for such great dates			2
" the way that we react to the emotional experiences in movies gives insight to how we might handle those emotional moments in real life , " he added			0
when two people are just getting to know one another , and impress one another , they might think twice before expressing such emotions , said @entity107 , a professor of psychology at @entity109			0
@entity107 , who has studied couples ' experiences with watching romantic movies , said more women than men give themselves permission to respond to sad or romantic movies			0
but holding back emotions can actually affect a viewers ' overall experience , he said			1
" the enjoyment of a movie is more based on the emotions you feel , rather than the emotions you express , " @entity107 noted			1
" but expressing [ those emotions ] can actually help you enjoy [ the experience ] more			1
" it 's like a fan allowing themselves to get caught up in the competitiveness of a sporting event			0
" when people watch a sporting event , and they 're all rooting for the same team , they 'll yell , cheer , hug each other , " @entity107 said			0
" that stuff enhances the enjoyment ( of the experience )			0
" even " the vow 's " stars , @entity142 and @entity143 , said they 've had movie - induced sob sessions in the past			1
@entity143 told the @entity147 that " @entity152 " and animal movies , like " @entity154 , " always seem to move him to tears while @entity142 admitted to crying so loudly during " @entity149 , " that she woke her sister up out of a sound sleep .			1

based on a true story , " @entity158 " opens in theaters on friday
" ( movies ) allow us to experience strong emotions in safe places "
@entity142 and @entity143 have admitted to having movie - induced sob sessions in the past
