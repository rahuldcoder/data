-- a graduate student is suing a @entity3 university , alleging that professors are requiring her to change her " biblical views " on homosexuality or be expelled from the counseling program there			1
@entity9 filed a civil rights action in @entity11 on july 21 saying @entity12 violated her " constitutional rights of speech , belief and religious exercise			1
" the action says university faculty have " promised to expel " @entity18 " because she has communicated both inside and outside the classroom that she holds to @entity21 ethical conviction on matters of human sexuality and gender identity			0
" after @entity9 expressed her views verbally and in written assignments , faculty mandated @entity9 complete a " remediation plan			1
" @entity0 obtained a copy of the remediation plan from the @entity32 , which represents @entity9 in the action			1
the plan addresses issues such as writing ability and organizational skills , as well as @entity9 's ability to be a " multiculturally competent counselor , particularly in regard to working with gay , lesbian , bisexual , transgender and queer / questioning populations			2
" among the plan 's requirements , @entity9 was to attend at least three diversity workshops , get more exposure to gay populations ( one suggestion was to attend a gay pride parade in @entity53 , where the university is located ) , do outside reading about gays and write reflections on these experiences and how they might benefit future clients			2
at first , @entity9 agreed to the remediation plan , according to the suit			1
then , she had second thoughts			0
in video provided by the @entity32 , @entity9 says , " i want to stay in the school counseling program , [ but ] i ca n't honestly complete the remediation program knowing i would have to alter by beliefs			1
i 'm not willing to -- and i know i ca n't -- change my biblical views			0
" in a statement to @entity0 , @entity12 said it " does not discriminate against any individuals on the basis of their personal , social , political , or religious beliefs or views			1
no student is asked to change their religious beliefs or views in order to participate in any program			1
" without commenting specifically on the @entity80 suit , the university also said , " the professional counselor 's job is to help clients clarify their current feelings and behaviors and to help them reach the goals that they have determined for themselves , not to dictate what those goals should be , what morals they should possess , or what values they should adopt. " in an interview wednesday on " @entity93 , " @entity91 , a senior counsel with the @entity32 , said all @entity9 did " was express her religious views inside of class and outside of class			1
" " as a result of that , she 's being subjected to what is best described as a thought - reform program , " @entity91 said			0
" it all goes back to a student engaging in constitutionally protected speech			2
" @entity91 added there was no allegation @entity9 has done anything to harm anyone in a counseling setting , or violated any code of ethics			1
also appearing on the program were @entity113 , manager of ethics and professional standards for the @entity117 , and @entity118 , a supervising senior staff attorney for the advocacy group @entity119			0
@entity113 said the @entity117 's code of ethics " is not an issue of thought - policing or putting any restrictions on beliefs of any kind			0
" " the code is concerned with counselors ' behaviors and how they interact with their clients , " she said			0
" talking to others -- espousing ideas about homosexuality or other beliefs is a behavior , " @entity113 said			2
" and if that behavior goes into imposing values , that does become an issue			0
" @entity91 said the remediation program itself seeks to change @entity9 's beliefs			1
he said while the @entity117 code prohibits imposing values , " these counseling professors have won the gold medal in the @entity145 of imposing values by trying to change her religious beliefs			1
" " this is not an issue about conduct in any form of a counseling setting , " @entity91 said			0
" this is a @entity154 issue about freedom of expression			0
" @entity118 , the attorney for @entity119 , said the potential problem is that " many people , especially young people in the coming - out or questioning process , are looking for a sympathetic and understanding ear			0
" to have somebody who is going to introduce their value system in a negative way can be extremely damaging , " he said			0
@entity91 said @entity9 has repeatedly told the counseling department she would uphold the valid code of ethics of the @entity117			1
asked how @entity9 would respond in a hypothetical situation of a child coming to her and saying he was gay , @entity91 said @entity9 would respond in an " ethical and appropriate way			2
" @entity91 said the counseling department has imposed its own set of values to " cleanse " @entity174 from students ' belief system , violating its own ethics code			1
when @entity118 mentioned that @entity18 espoused " conversion therapy , " @entity91 said the allegation was unsubstantiated			0
@entity118 said @entity9 's or anyone 's belief system had to be " pushed to one side			2
" @entity113 concurred , saying , " in the counseling profession , as with the medical profession , the needs of the client supercede the needs of the counselor			0
" @entity9 's suit asks for nominal and actual damages based on violation of her civil rights			2
" @entity93 " writer @entity193 contributed to this report .			0
