@entity0 -- for many families , a night at the ballpark is a treat			1
but it can be a nightmare for those with autistic children			1
autism causes a greater sensitivity to environmental stimulation			1
so the lights , music and roar of the crowd can trigger a severe meltdown that is difficult to anticipate and control			2
" they 're frustrated and they 're scared and they 're just overwhelmed , " said @entity18 , whose 8 - year - old son , @entity19 , has autism			1
" you have to ask yourself if it 's worth it			2
" the @entity27 recently reported that 1 in 68 children in the @entity29 are on the autism spectrum			1
for many of these families , fear of how their child will react to new situations -- and how others will react to them -- keeps them from gaining everyday experiences others get to have			1
" it is tough to go out into public , " said @entity40 , mother of @entity41 , 6			2
" when he 's having a meltdown on the floor and the whole entire store 's looking at you like you 're a bad mom , you just want to go and crawl under a rock			2
" dr. @entity50 was heartbroken to hear stories like this from families			1
the developmental pediatrician also knew that isolation did n't serve her patients well in the long run			1
" if kids are not in the community , building their skills from very young ages , then there 's no reason to expect them to be independent one day , " @entity58 said			1
" it 's a social disability			1
it needs to be addressed in a social setting			1
" so in 2007 , @entity58 set out to do just that			2
today , her nonprofit , @entity69 , helps families affected by autism navigate challenging social situations , such as airport travel , sporting events and museum visits			1
" if you start taking steps outside of your door , your world gets bigger and bigger , " said @entity58 , 43			0
" we just want people to have opportunities			0
" take me out to the ball game many @entity87 teams hold annual " autism awareness nights , " when they take temporary measures such as lowering the volume on the public address system			1
but @entity58 wanted to do more			0
" you ca n't turn down the volume of the world , " @entity58 said			0
" it 's nice to do it for one night , but our goal is for families to be able to go to a game on any night			1
" to that end , @entity58 partnered with the @entity102 in 2012 to develop an innovative program			0
she armed all the @entity102 game - day employees -- approximately 3,000 people -- with knowledge about autism and how to interact with individuals who have the disorder			1
now , everyone from the ticket takers to the hot dog vendors at @entity113 help create an atmosphere where families feel supported			1
" i do n't expect the staff to be experts , just to be aware of it and ( be ) understanding , " @entity58 said			0
" if families need a break , the staff know where to take ( them ) for a little sensory rest			1
" @entity58 also helps prepare the families for the event			1
they are given a booklet with pictures illustrating each step of the game , from arrival and getting a hot dog to the seventh inning stretch			0
then she escorts families to their first game , with tickets donated by the @entity102			1
each family is also provided a clinician at the game who gives additional support if problems arise			0
for @entity18 , having the professional assistance was a huge relief			0
" when @entity19 was anxious or ready to leave , i had somebody to turn to , and she had some ideas , " @entity18 said			0
" without her there , it would 've been a very tough game for me			0
" @entity58 hopes that this supported experience will give families the confidence to return on their own			2
she also believes that this dual approach -- working with the @entity102 and the families -- just makes sense			2
" it 's not enough to work with a child with autism , because we need the community to accept them , " she said			2
" you would never show someone how to use a wheelchair and then not have a ramp			0
" beyond the ballpark @entity58 has also found her airport travel program to be successful for families			1
using the same principles , she trains airline and security staff at major airports and then guides families through a simulated travel experience , including checking in , going through security and boarding a plane			1
since 2010 , more than 200 families have benefited from @entity58 ' initiatives			2
building on her success with the @entity102 , she is now working with @entity0 's football and hockey teams			0
soon she wants to partner with the city 's public transportation agency			0
" the hope for @entity0 is to make it the most autism - friendly city in the country , " she said			2
" it will serve as a model of independence for other cities everywhere			0
" @entity58 also hopes that the tools she gives families can help them explore other settings on their own			2
" we really see it as a stepping stone to a brighter future , " she said			0
" i feel like it changes the trajectory of lives			0
" after their successful outing at the ballpark , @entity18 took @entity19 to a football game			0
she believes this is just the beginning of their family 's adventures			0
" hopefully , there will be zoos in our future , and aquariums , " @entity18 said			0
" the world is our oyster			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity69 website at www.autismir.com and see			0

parents of children on the autism spectrum often skip social situations out of fear
but dr. @entity50 wants her young patients with autism to have those experiences
her nonprofit helps families navigate events like ball games , air travel and museum trips
