@entity6 sure has done a lot to take a good picture			1
the chief financial officer from @entity10 , @entity11 , has a second life as a wildlife photographer			1
his passion started early , at age 8			2
his grandparents gave him a camera before a trip to @entity19 , thinking he might like to photograph the bears			2
" i struggled when i was young with focus , so they thought picture - taking would be a good hobby , " he said			2
since then , he 's visited @entity25 10 times , taken photos of animals on all seven continents , and been to both the @entity31 poles			1
he 's photographed pandas in @entity39 , gorillas in @entity37 , lions in @entity33 and polar bears in @entity35			2
he 'd ultimately like to take underwater photos of a @entity41			1
experience the majesty of @entity6 's wildlife photography , and that of other @entity46 , in the gallery above			1
and if you 'd like to shoot gorgeous animal photos of your own -- whether of the birds in your back yard or on a monthlong safari -- follow their tips below			1
get comfortable outside if you want to take pictures of animals , you 'll be spending a lot of time outside			2
" starting out , you need a passion for the outdoors , " said @entity6			2
" shooting animals is all about having enough time to linger for an extended amount of time waiting for the right shot			2
start with a sure thing for those who are n't used to shooting wildlife , photographer and @entity69 recommends visiting your local zoo for some practice			1
" the variety of animals on display in a relatively confined area will give the beginner the opportunity to be up close to numerous species in a setting that makes them easy to capture , " he said			2
pets and backyard animals can also be good practice subjects			2
when you 're ready to up the ante , head to a nearby state or national park to find and photograph animals in the wild			2
splurge on your lenses " buy the absolute best lens you can -- glass makes all the difference in quality photographs -- and be less focused on the camera body , " said @entity69			2
" the ' guts ' of most dslrs in any brand are similar across the various lines " ( and prices )			2
although it 's helpful to have a variety of lenses for capturing animals , if you 're only going to buy one for your wildlife shots , make it a telephoto or super telephoto lens			1
" it is a basic lens of wildlife [ photography ] , " said nature photographer @entity113 , as it allows you to zoom in			1
" more often than not , the animals are a distance away from you , and that is probably good idea since it is always preferable not to place yourself in close proximity to certain animals , " advised @entity69			2
@entity6 recommends going with a 400 - millimeter for the strongest close - ups			2
but if you 're not sure , @entity46 producer @entity129 , who is also a wildlife photographer , advises renting before you buy			1
" start at a local camera rental shop , " she said			0
" test out a few of their @entity134 beginner recommendations " to find out what you like and are most comfortable with			0
even if your budget limits you to a point - and - shoot camera rather than a higher - quality @entity134 , make sure you get one with a good optical zoom			1
@entity140 , which is achieved electronically rather than by adjustment of the camera 's lens , reduces quality and can result in pixelation			0
this " may not give you the clarity that makes for a good image , " said photographer and @entity147 @entity146			0
skip the tripod you might think a tripod is a good idea for capturing sharp photographs , but when it comes to animals , you 'd be wrong , says @entity69			0
" you may set up a tripod looking forward and an animal may suddenly appear to your left , right , [ or ] behind and you will miss the opportunity trying to get the angle if mounted on a tripod , " he explained			1
if you 're looking for more stability , " a monopod would be a good thing to buy instead of a tripod , " advised @entity6			0
its single leg will help steady the camera without limiting your range of motion like a tripod can			0
be patient " if you think things happen quickly like the @entity176 , social media or sports , you will be disappointed , " warned @entity6			0
he spent hours hiking through the " dense jungle " of @entity37 and @entity178 over three different trips to capture a stunning close - up of a mountain gorilla			0
" if you want to photograph wildlife , you have to be quiet and when you see them , you have to move slowly and try not to scare them , " added freelance photographer @entity182			1
" i always look for their tracks on the ground			0
" " animals do n't pose and seldom smile on cue , " agreed @entity190			0
" you have to learn to be very , very patient			0
it could take hours , days or even years to get just the right shot			0
" @entity113 will spend up to 10 hours a day waiting for a photo -- and has been shooting some species for more than 10 years			0
change your perspective as you 're clicking away , think about the perspective and goal of your images			1
for @entity6 , that means creating " a special relationship between the animal being photographed and the person viewing the picture			1
" as a result , he likes to shoot from the animal 's perspective -- " get on your knees and shoot at their level			1
" @entity113 tries to capture the human side of the animals he shoots , while @entity69 focuses on their wildness			0
" my goal as a wildlife photographer these days is to photograph animals in their natural settings , unencumbered by artificial environments such as zoo captivity , and show their beauty as they were meant to be , " he said			1
and @entity223 hopes to pass along an environmental message with her pictures			0
" i hope to bring people closer to nature ... to pass on a message that we all must strive to minimize our impact on the earth , " she said			0
capture the eyes they 're the windows to the soul , you know , and @entity190 says they 're also the key to a stunning animal portrait			1
" they will help you tell the story and give the image that extra spark of life that will touch you and all those who eventually see the image , " he said			0
" get as close as possible			0
know your equipment imagine how you 'd feel if you dropped a wad of cash on a fancy new camera , went on your fabulous safari vacation , saw a majestic lion posing perfectly -- and could n't figure out how to turn off your flash or adjust your aperture			0
give yourself plenty of time and opportunities for practice before your holiday of a lifetime			0
" there is nothing worse than buying the latest hot camera and leaving the next day , hoping it was be the thing that gets you that award - winning photo , " warned @entity190			0
anticipate " animals are unpredictable , " said @entity6			0
they 're not going to hold their pose for you , so try to anticipate and start snapping before they strike that perfect silhouette or move into just the right spot			0
" look for the anticipative moment , " advised @entity190			0
" one of the most common things for us all to do is to be watching the action in front of us and forget to push the little button			0
shoot , shoot , shoot all our experts agree that more is more when it comes to photographing wildlife			1
experiment ! " said @entity6			0
take photos at " different exposures , different shutter speeds , different apertures " to see what works best , advises @entity190			1
shoot from a variety of angles and times to capture different light levels , said @entity113 , and be sure to capture the animal making a variety of expressions			1
finally , whatever you do , bring lots and lots of digital storage and extra batteries so you can click away without worry			1
