we all know what makes a great beach bar			0
killer ocean views , sunset exposure and a creative menu from which , for once , you do n't have to feel ashamed about drinks that come in coconut shells garnished with pink umbrellas			0
in @entity11 , though , perfect beach drinkeries also have to be imbued with that distinctive mahalo spirit			0
these 10 waterfront watering holes have all that , and then some			0
@entity16 of @entity17 ( @entity18 ) @entity16 of @entity17 almost seems too obvious , with its prime @entity20 location and unobstructed views of @entity22			1
as the name suggests , it sits right on the edge of the @entity17 's infinity pool -- happy souls occasionally float past you on orange bean bags			1
every morning between 10 a.m. and noon , bartenders serve $ 3 draft beers and $ 7 cocktails ; in the afternoon , there 's live acoustic music and umbrella - topped pina coladas			1
for all the cliches , the bar remains quintessentially @entity17 , frequented by visitors and locals alike			1
@entity16 of @entity17 , 2255 @entity40 on @entity20 , @entity41 ; +1 808 922 4422 @entity42 ( @entity43 ) @entity44 might be your textbook @entity46 beach bar -- tiki torches , swaying palms , hula dancing and a live band -- but its kitschy charm works			1
the location helps -- it 's on quiet @entity54 on the @entity43 's northwestern coast			2
though its decor can be described as casual , at best -- basic rattan chairs and tables on the sand -- the drinks are strong and cheap , with $ 5 cocktails during happy hour , and service is attentive and energetic			0
@entity42 , 69 - 1081 @entity65 on @entity54 , @entity66 , @entity43 ; +1 808 769 5282 @entity67 ( @entity68 ) though @entity67 is located just steps from low - key @entity71 on @entity68 's southwest coast , it 's not exactly what you 'd call low key			1
its beechwood exteriors , surf - inspired art and artisan cocktails attract a largely young clientele , mainly guests at the @entity82			2
but there 's no attitude here : bartenders are chatty and easygoing and there 's a solid local presence , particularly during football season when drinks are half - price during games			1
the signature @entity92 cocktail , a mix of @entity95 , tequila , rum , pineapple and lime , is a crowd favorite			0
@entity67 , 3550 @entity101 on @entity71 , @entity82 , @entity68 ; +1 808 573 1234 @entity102 ( @entity18 ) sheltered beneath the sprawling branches of a century - old kiawe tree behind the @entity106 's orchid pool , @entity102 feels tucked away despite its central @entity20 address			1
each night on a small , oceanfront stage , live @entity46 music is paired with traditional hula dancing performed by former @entity113 winners as the sun sets over @entity17			1
the signature cocktail is a mai tai -- more than one call it the best on the island -- served over crushed ice and a sugarcane stick , and garnished with a mint leaf and a @entity123 orchid			0
@entity102 , 2199 @entity124 on @entity20 , @entity41 ; +1 808 923 2311 @entity125 ( @entity126 ) quite possibly the only true beach bar on @entity126 's north shore , @entity125 pairs barefoot appeal with strong drinks and views over @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134			1
though the bar is part of the @entity138 , it 's more minimalist than posh			2
its clientele skews young and moneyed			0
drinks are typically priced for a five - star resort bar -- $ 10 for a local beer , $ 16 for a margarita -- but cocktails are served with flair and made with the fresh juice of local fruit like lilikoi and lychee			2
@entity125 ; 5520 @entity151 on @entity133 , @entity152 , @entity126 ; +1 808 826 9644 @entity153 ( @entity68 ) though the @entity153 at the @entity68 is known more for its swim - up appeal -- it 's on the edge of a 120 - foot infinity pool -- it 's also located beachfront , directly overlooking @entity159			1
an ocean - facing terrace with lounge chairs offers views over the @entity165 mountain range and the island of @entity167			2
the bar offers a substantial selection of local and organic beer and 18 cocktails , the most popular being the mai tai , which can be served in a pineapple upon request			0
@entity153 at @entity68 , 3900 @entity101 , @entity82 , @entity68 ; +1 808 874 8000 @entity175 ( @entity18 ) @entity176 and @entity177 ( for whom a cocktail has been named ) are said to frequent the @entity20 institution that is the @entity175			1
though the outdoor bar is encircled by a low barricade , the separation of bar and beach feels imperceptible thanks to the proximity of the sand -- you can reach over in your seat and grab a handful			0
a contemporary @entity46 musical trio plays six nights a week			0
their sunset rendition of @entity196 's " @entity197 " is predictable but never tired			2
@entity175 ; 2259 @entity40 on @entity20 , @entity41 ; +1 808 923 7311 @entity198 at @entity200 's @entity199 ( @entity68 ) located on @entity201 , the lower - key @entity68 outpost of @entity200 's @entity17 is an easy stroll from @entity203 , but far enough away from the @entity205 beach bar crowds to feel somewhat secluded			1
its thatched umbrellas and tiki torches are proudly kitsch -- this is @entity200 's , after all			2
half - price happy hour kicks off at 3 p.m. and ends at sunset			2
local crooners hop on the mic shortly after to set the aloha vibe in full swing with renditions of " @entity217 " and " @entity218			0
" @entity198 at @entity200 's @entity199 , 130 @entity219 on @entity201 , @entity220 , @entity68 ; +1 808 662 2900 @entity221 ( @entity126 ) just 15 minutes from @entity224 , this @entity223 coast bar is perfectly situated for a pre- or post-flight drink			1
its outdoor dining deck overlooks the long expanse of @entity230 , and the bar menu is large and interesting			0
popular drinks include macadamia hot - buttered rum with cloves , and the spicy @entity237 martini			2
on wednesday evenings the entire bar menu is half price			0
the small plates are made with 90 % local ingredients			0
@entity221 ; 4820 @entity242 at @entity230 , @entity243 , @entity126 ; +1 808 822 9332 @entity244 ( @entity43 ) located on the sands of @entity247 on the @entity43 's @entity248 , the @entity245 is good for sunset cocktails and turtle - spotting -- sometimes simultaneously			1
though the thatched - roof bar has an informal vibe , it 's got a sophisticated beer and wine menu ( more than 60 wines by the glass ) and 19 cocktails , including the popular limoncello - pear concoction that 's the signature @entity260			1
bartenders and wait staff avoid cheesy aloha shirts for casual blue tees and share local knowledge freely			0
