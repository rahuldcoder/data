@entity0 -- a massive crowd of demonstrators swelled around an iconic church in the heart of @entity0 on thursday , shouting " down with corruption " and " i can live without the @entity7			1
" @entity1 affiliate @entity8 reported that police used tear gas in some areas of the city as clashes erupted			2
police initially reported tens of thousands of protesters in @entity0 but later said the crowds had grown to more than 300,000 people			2
one death was reported in @entity20 state , where a young man was run over by an suv at an intersection during a demonstration , state police said			1
outside the @entity26 , organizers called for protesters to march peacefully as they listed a wide variety of demands directed at the @entity32 country 's government			1
in the nation 's capital , a group of protesters on thursday twice forced their way into the foreign ministry building			2
police repelled both incursions , but not before protesters lit a fire inside the building , state media reported			1
large demonstrations in @entity0 , @entity20 and @entity46 came a day after a movement that started as a protest against a 9 - cent increase in bus fares scored a major victory			1
both @entity20 and @entity0 agreed to roll back the prices on bus and metro tickets			1
but will it be too little , too late ? the movement has galvanized people across the country who say they 're fed up with high taxes and a lack of services -- such as health and education -- while the government spends billions on preparations for the @entity7			1
in @entity0 on thursday , protesters held signs saying , " i 'd swap 10 stadiums for one decent hospital in this country " and " i 'd give up the @entity7 for better education in my country			1
" " fundamentally , people are on the streets because they have very different demands , but they do n't have a forum for expressing them and for being heard			2
and the bus fares were just one of these many many different things , " said @entity80 , one of the protest organizers			0
@entity80 said she hoped this week 's protests will mark a turning point in @entity87 , where democracy is still relatively young			1
" i think that what government has n't understood is that there will be no single demand that will calm people down , per se			0
i think fundamentally , if they do n't open up , if they do n't become more transparent and truly welcoming of participation , people will continue to demonstrate , " @entity80 said			0
" it might be for now			0
it might be in the future , but this is n't going to go away until we have a democracy that works			0
" whom does the @entity7 benefit ? protesters say the poorest are being short - changed while the government spends the large bills on new stadiums and glitzy infrastructure for the soccer competition @entity87 is hosting next year and the @entity108 coming in 2016			1
they complain that corruption is driving up the costs			0
' the man who made a nation cry ' the government responds the country 's investment in those projects includes money for health and public transportation , deputy sports minister @entity114 has said			2
" there is absolutely nothing contradictory between organizing a @entity7 and investing in health and education , " he said			2
an elite @entity126 , made up of specially trained firefighters and police officers , will deploy to states hosting the games , the @entity125 said late tuesday			0
the government has stressed that the force 's mission is to mediate and not repress			2
@entity87 president @entity134 told peaceful protesters tuesday that their message was being heard			1
she praised them as active participants in democracy and said her government is committed to " social transformation			0
" police for the most part stood back , and the atmosphere grew festive and loud , with throngs singing and beating drums			0
hidden in the peaceful multitudes were bands of rowdies who kicked down doors and broke windows , looted shops and tipped over cars and set them on fire			0
they left a trail of rubble down the protest routes			0
while asking police to back off from peaceful protesters , @entity134 has condemned " isolated and minor acts of violence , " telling police to confront them " with vigor			0
" in light of the protests , the @entity87 president has postponed a trip to @entity171 , the state - run @entity165 news agency reported thursday			1
@entity134 had been scheduled to travel to @entity171 on june 23 - 28 , the government news agency reported , citing the president 's communications secretary			1
a new date for the trip has not been announced , @entity165 said			0
weeks of protests for nearly two weeks , tens of thousands of @entity87 marched through the streets night after night			1
crowds originally protesting bus fares grew into multitudes decrying social injustice on tuesday , as broad avenues filled to capacity for blocks			0
the protests come amid the soccer @entity188 tournament , a friendly array of matches , in which the host country , @entity87 , plays against a small group of national teams from around the globe			1
the cup serves as a precursor to the @entity7			2
the majority of marchers are young and well - educated			0
@entity200 , a university student and one of the organizers , says public transportation should be free -- especially in expensive , sprawling cities such as @entity20			2
" you ca n't go to hospital ; you ca n't see your friends ; you ca n't go to school ; you ca n't go to work , " he said , describing how much the city 's residents rely on mass transit			0
lowering fares , he said , would prove that the government was listening			0
but it 's too soon to know whether it will bring an end to protests or fuel further and more far - reaching demands			1
are you there ? share photos or video , but stay safe @entity87 wins @entity188 opener @entity1 's @entity224 reported from @entity0			1
@entity1 's @entity225 reported from @entity20			1
