-- ten years and 1.2 billion users into its existence , there 's no question that @entity6 has changed our lives			1
whether it was an inspired vision , deft execution , a bit of dumb luck or a combination of all three , @entity15 's social juggernaut has ingrained itself into the daily lives of digital - age users in a way that forebears like @entity19 and contemporaries like @entity21 could only imagine			1
which is not to say it 's all " likes " and " shares " and happy kid pics			2
as with any new ( or newly discovered ) technology , the impact of the end product is largely in the hands of the user			0
we are , after all , only human -- with all the joy and sadness , decency and ugliness that that entails			0
so here , as @entity6 turns 10 on tuesday , is a look back at five ways the social network has changed us -- for better and for worse			1
share ! share ! share ! the good : wedding announcements ? thing of the past			2
birth announcement ? just slap an @entity46 shot of that bouncing baby boy or girl on your timeline			0
dating ? graduated ? bought a house ? got a puppy ? same deal			0
we take it for granted now , but the ability to share major events with all the people closest to you with a single click of the mouse is unprecedented			0
there were the @entity64 of the world before @entity6			1
but mom , your second cousin and @entity69 were n't on them			2
and it 's not just the good stuff , either			2
changing that relationship status to " single " can save you from those awkward " how 's @entity74 doing ? you two are so cute together ! " conversations			2
the bad : overshare ! overshare ! overshare ! seriously			0
ten years in , some folks have n't figured out what everyone on their friends list wants , or needs , to know			1
ok , sometimes those pictures of your dinner look delicious			0
but the detailed updates on your mundane day are mind - numbing and the play - by - play of your 3 - year - old 's potty training is just -- too much			1
we all want to know you got a wedding ring			0
the fact that you just polished the one you 've had for 14 years ? not so much			0
the past is not really past the good : when a site has 1.2 billion users ( ok , we all know some of those are multiple or abandoned accounts , so let 's say at least a cool billion ) it 's a pretty amazing database of the world 's web - enabled population			1
that means your odds of finding just about anybody are a heck of a lot better than they were 10 years ago			2
there have been the remarkable tales , like the woman who -- after years of failed efforts -- reunited after 44 years with her birth mother			0
how long did it take on @entity6 ? two days			1
for most of us , it 's less dramatic than that			2
childhood friends who moved long ago , college roommates who drifted away , even former teachers who served as inspirations are now but a quick search away			2
there 's no doubt we have friends because of @entity6 that we would n't have otherwise			1
the bad : sometimes , drifting apart is n't a bad thing			1
yes , your old high - school classmates got annoying and your cousin 's politics disgust you			1
but we 're not talking about that			0
we 're talking about exes			0
nostalgia is part of life			0
but , with @entity6 , getting nostalgic about an old crush or flame could lead to a late - night @entity6 message			1
or , you know , a poke			0
" i see @entity6 issues breaking up marriages all the time , " @entity147 , a divorce attorney in @entity148 , @entity149 , told the @entity150			1
more than 80 % of @entity154 divorce attorneys say they 've seen an increase in cases involving social media , according to the @entity158 of @entity159 , and one - third of all divorce filings last year contained the word @entity6 , according to a survey by @entity163			1
temptation is always out there			0
but with @entity6 , it can be a little too convenient			1
it makes you happy the good : in 2009 , a survey of 2,600 college students by researchers at the @entity171 showed that those who were the heaviest users of @entity6 were the most satisfied with their lives			1
they also were more likely to be engaged socially and politically			0
more recently , a @entity175 study showed that , after five minutes of looking at their own shiny @entity6 profiles , users experienced a significant boost in self - esteem			1
a 2011 @entity181 study delivered similar results			0
" for many people , there 's an automatic assumption that the @entity187 is bad , " associate professor @entity183 said at the time			2
" this is one of the first studies to show that there 's a psychological benefit of @entity6			1
" the bad : or maybe it makes you unhappy			0
other studies have looked at aspects of @entity6 use and the results have been less encouraging			1
last year , a @entity200 researcher found that looking at posts by @entity6 friends -- you know , the photos of smiling kids on vacation in the @entity204 or announcements about promotions , engagements and awesome nights on the town -- can make us feel sadder about our own humdrum lives			1
" on the surface , @entity6 provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling the basic human need for social connection , " the study reads			1
" rather than enhancing well - being , however , these findings suggest that @entity6 may undermine it			1
" as with many things , your mileage may very			0
but what 's clear is that @entity6 has become such a part of our lives that it tweaks our emotions , for better or worse			1
every day is a reunion the good : reuniting with classmates from high school or college has never been easier			0
@entity236 , a class reunion committee looking to celebrate five , 10 or 20 years post-diploma faced a thankless task			0
" where does @entity239 live these days ? " " who has @entity243 's phone number ? " " do you know @entity246 's married name ? " now ? one @entity6 event invitation and you can focus on booking the best ' 80s cover band available			1
the bad : if every day is a reunion , why have a reunion ? actually reuniting with old classmates is losing some of its appeal when we know the names of the former theater club president 's three kids and which character from " @entity262 " she 'd be			0
@entity263 , co-founder of reunion website @entity265 , told the @entity266 that he has noticed a drop - off in the number of reunions in recent years , particularly among folks in their mid- to late 20s			1
" people i have n't talked to in years will see my wedding pictures on @entity6 , then i 'll see them in person and we wo n't say one word to each other ... , " @entity272 , a 23 - year - old whose five - year reunion fizzled to a small party at the class president 's house , told the paper			1
" why go to a high school reunion when you 're going to stand around and go , ' so , how did that doctor 's appointment go yesterday ? ' " privacy the good : for those willing to find and use them , @entity6 provides tools that let you select who sees what			1
so , while grandma is welcome to look at those pics of the kids playing in the snow , she might not need to be privy to your strongly worded rant about the cable guy who is two days late			0
you can direct that one instead to buddies with a proper appreciation for your expansive vocabulary			0
rival @entity21 is designed by default to be a public forum , where you broadcast your 140 - character pearls of wisdom to the world			0
@entity6 allows that , too , but is more geared toward limiting your thoughts to certain family and friends			2
the bad : well , you know			0
security breaches have been a reality of many websites ' growth			0
but as its user base grew dramatically , @entity6 's problems ( like the time ceo and founder @entity15 got his own page hacked ) played out in front of a massive , and nervous , audience			1
while @entity6 has privacy settings that let users protect information , some privacy advocates say the network does n't make them easy enough to find and use			1
( @entity6 has worked to ease those concerns , especially for younger users )			2
at the end of the day , @entity6 benefits when you decide to share more openly			2
the details about your life that you share on @entity6 are rounded up and compiled into a profile of you that helps advertisers target you with things they think you 'll like			2
so , when you announced your pregnancy and were , soon after , bombarded with @entity6 ads for a bunch of baby stuff ? that was no coincidence			2
to be clear , @entity6 is not handing advertisers information about you personally			2
but , somewhere , there exists a nameless profile of a user with your hometown , gender , age and likes and dislikes , just waiting to be used for marketing purposes			0
that , in a nutshell , is the entry fee to use this remarkable social tool			0
yes , @entity6 has changed the way we communicate			1
whether it is truly cost - free remains another question .			0

@entity6 turns 10 next week and has *undeniably* changed how many of us live
for many of those changes , there are *positive* and *negative* sides
in the @entity6 age , there 's rarely such thing as a long - lost friend
but some folks still have n't figured out *etiquette* of social sharing
