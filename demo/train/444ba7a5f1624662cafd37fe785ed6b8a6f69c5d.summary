when president @entity1 decided to take questions directly over social media he did n't turn to his 28 million @entity5 fans , or his 19 million @entity7 followers			1
instead , he turned to a website called @entity9 where popularity is measured , fittingly , in votes			1

in roughly 30 minutes , @entity1 waded through hundreds of questions , answering only 10 on a wide range of topics including balancing life and family , and protecting internet freedom			1
his unexpected online appearance caused a traffic surge that temporarily locked users out of the @entity9 site , said general manager @entity42 in a g - chat interview with @entity44			1
