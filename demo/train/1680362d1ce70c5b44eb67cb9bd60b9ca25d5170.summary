-- @entity1 walks into a big open room , sits down on the floor and points to a number , which is stenciled on the wall			1
it was his prison number and the spot on the floor where he says he was shackled in @entity13 's infamous @entity12			1
the prisoners who entered were often killed			1
@entity1 was one of the few who survived the torture , starvation and executions routine when the @entity19 were in power			1
led by the late @entity22 , the regime was responsible for the deaths of millions of ordinary @entity13 during a four - year reign of terror that was eventually halted in 1979 by invading @entity26 forces			1
but the memories of this dark chapter continue to haunt victims such as @entity1 more than 30 years later , as four surviving members of the @entity19 leadership , including @entity22 's " number two , " prepare to stand trial for their alleged role in the genocide			1
in 1975 , the @entity19 ordered everyone out of the capital @entity39 and other cities in @entity13 to work in the countryside as farm laborers			1
@entity1 , an artist , was sent off to work in the paddy fields			1
one day in 1977 , he was told he was being moved away from farm life			1
" i was supposed to move to the @entity45 of @entity46 , but instead i was brought to s - 21 , also known as @entity12 , " he says			1
" the first thing i saw was the people that had long hair to the waist			1
their eyes were sunken and their bodies were only bone and skin			2
" it did n't take long before the plight of the others became his fate			2
but art saved his life			2
the prison officials asked him if he could draw brother number 1 , the man known as @entity22 , the leader of the @entity19			1
they were impressed by his work , so he began working on a huge portrait that would take him months			2
the @entity19 government was then wreaking havoc on the entire country			1
it is said to be responsible for about 1.7 million deaths , roughly a quarter of the population back them			2
its aim was to create a communist utopia but instead the regime forced @entity13 into a living hell			2
city dwellers were marched into the countryside and forced to work as farm laborers			2
those already living in rural @entity13 were expected to produce enough food for the country while teaching farming to those who had never done it before			1
currency was abolished , and anyone with an education was considered a threat			2
no one was allowed modern medicine and the country isolated itself trying to become completely self - sufficient			2
the results were disastrous : people died of starvation and disease as soldiers tortured and killed anyone suspected of being disloyal			1
eventually , everyone , including the soldiers , became a target due to the leadership 's paranoia			2
@entity104 was a soldier , although he says he never had a gun and was only given farming tools			2
by 1978 , a year before the fall of the @entity19 , @entity104 and all the soldiers in his brigade were arrested and sent to work on an airport			1
@entity104 said he saw people dying of hunger as they tried to build the airport and the road leading up to it			0
as he walks up to the airport road where he once toiled , he suddenly begins to sob			0
it is the first time he has been back since 1979			0
" i cry when i remember the people and my older brother who they separated from me			0
" he has not seen his older brother since			0
he does n't even know where the body is buried			0
@entity104 himself was supposed to be one of the tens of thousands of bodies dumped in what have become known as the " killing fields " located all over @entity13			1
but @entity104 and a few others in his brigade fought back the day they were supposed to die			0
he says when the soldiers came into the building where all 292 members of his brigade had been taken it was clear they meant to exterminate them			0
" when we got inside they were shouting you betrayed ( us )			0
then they came inside the house and we fought back			0
" he and 12 others escaped			0
@entity104 's sister - in - law @entity145 worked at the same site where the soldiers were taken and watched in horror the fate of hundreds of unarmed people			0
" i saw a truck full of people			0
... i hid and tried to listen more			0
then i saw them ( soldiers ) holding guns			0
they were hiding in the forests on both sides with guns , " she recalls			0
" shoot , shoot , shoot , bang , bang , bang , " @entity145 re-enacts with her hands			0
" ... when the people got off the truck they tied their hands and then they walked the people to the hole they had dug , then they killed all those people and then the second truck came			0
" eventually , she says , a tractor would cover the hole with dirt even if the people inside it were still alive			0
there are still two noticeable indentations where villagers point out you can still see the gravesites in their village			0
similar scenes were repeated around the country			0
more than three decades on and the story is not yet over			0
the remaining leaders of the regime are finally being put on trial			1
the indictment , more than 350 pages long , includes accusations of everything from genocide to torture to war crimes			1
case number 002 is the second and perhaps most important case being heard by the @entity205 - backed tribunal in @entity13			0
" they are alleged to be responsible for the whole policy , which ended up in crimes being conducted all over this country , " says @entity206 , the spokesman for the @entity207			0
" it is probably one of the first times since the @entity215 ( the case against the @entity217 that began in 1945 ) where the whole remaining political leadership ... have been put on trial together			1
cambodians have been waiting for more than 30 years for someone to be held accountable for what happened during the years the @entity19 was in power			1
" tens of thousands of people from around @entity13 are expected to come watch the trial , even if for only one day			1
as for @entity145 , @entity104 and @entity1 , they hope the trial provides the answer to one question that has haunted them all these years : why would a government treat its own people this way ? @entity0 's @entity233 contributed to this report .			1

survivors of torture , disease , starvation have many questions
tens of thousands died under @entity19
remaining leaders of @entity19 to stand trial
thousands expected to come watch the trial
