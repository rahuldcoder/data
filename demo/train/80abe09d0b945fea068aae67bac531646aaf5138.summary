-- the week - old redesign of quick - messaging service @entity2 was meant to simplify its tools and make it more accessible to newbies			1
but it has had some unintended consequences			0
independent developers of applications that tie into @entity2 's network say they have experienced significant accelerations in downloads and revenue since @entity2 launched last week			1
when addicts of the social network got their hands on the new version , many recoiled upon seeing the changes			0
they were especially vocal about the loss of some features in @entity2 's mobile apps and about the private - message tab being hidden within another menu			1
so thousands flocked to the various app stores to get third - party apps that look more like the previous version of @entity2			1
some of the most popular apps cost a few dollars , unlike the free app made by @entity2			1
@entity31 , an anime - themed app for the @entity34 , more than doubled its usual revenue just after @entity2 's major redesign , said @entity37 , a co-founder for app maker @entity38			1
when the small developer cut the price of @entity31 in half on friday , to 99 cents , revenue increased more than tenfold , @entity37 said			0
independent trackers of app downloads verify that @entity31 and others experienced big gains			0
" word of mouth really goes a long way on @entity2 , " @entity37 wrote in an e-mail			0
the maker of another popular app , @entity53 , saw a " bump " after the @entity2 changes , which carried through to this week , said @entity56 , the head of app maker @entity57			1
this effect is common , but short - lived , after a major change to @entity2 , he said			2
@entity53 , which offers a free version with ads or a full version for $ 4.99 , experienced a similar boost in march after @entity2 updated its @entity34 app with a much - maligned feature called the @entity67 , @entity56 said			2
the @entity67 , which critics dubbed @entity70 after @entity2 ceo @entity68 , added an ever - present ticker showing trending topics and ads. within a month , @entity2 had removed the feature			2
" please stop complaining about the new @entity2 app , " @entity37 wrote on his @entity75 account last week			2
" they might revert back , and i 'm really enjoying the increase in sales			0
" for a relatively new @entity2 app , like @entity81 , the backlash provided some much - needed attention			2
that app , which costs $ 1.99 , has seen about three times as many downloads in the week since @entity2 4.0			1
" we 've definitely seen a spike since @entity2 updated their official client , " @entity87 , the @entity81 developer , wrote in an e-mail			0
" changes like the ones they 've made tend to be quite polarizing , oftentimes magnetizing audiences towards newer third party clients			0
" in march , during the @entity67 fiasco , @entity2 began discouraging makers of these types of apps from pursuing development			0
@entity103 , a leader on @entity2 's developer relations team , wrote then in a memo to partners that they should not be building software that reproduces the functions of a standard @entity2 app. " we need to move to a less fragmented world , where every user can experience @entity2 in a consistent way , " @entity103 wrote			1
" this is already happening organically -- the number and market share of consumer client apps that are not owned or operated by @entity2 has been shrinking			0
" as that number seems to grow slightly , it 's unclear whether @entity2 's stance has changed			1
a @entity2 spokeswoman declined to comment , and @entity103 did n't immediately respond to a request for comment .			0

@entity2 's redesign last week *spurred* more downloads for third - party apps
many @entity2 users were *unhappy* with the overhaul to @entity2
some were willing to *pay* a *premium* for apps that look *familiar*
