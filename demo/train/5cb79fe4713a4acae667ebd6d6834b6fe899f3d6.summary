-- @entity1 came to @entity2 to end wars			1
that much was crystal clear only three months ago when @entity1 gave a keynote speech on may 23 at the @entity8 in @entity2 in which he called for an end to the " boundless war on terror " and " perpetual wartime footing " that has existed in the @entity13 since 9/11			1
@entity1 focused part of this speech on the @entity16 for the @entity17 that @entity18 passed days after 9/11 and that gave president @entity20 the authority to go to war in @entity23			1
@entity1 looks to @entity18 to bolster legal case for @entity26 strike no one in @entity18 who voted for this resolution at the time realized that he or she was in effect authorizing in @entity23 what would become @entity13 's longest war			1
nor did they realize that they were giving a virtual blank check to the president to wage covert @entity13 wars in countries such as @entity40 and @entity41 where , according to data compiled by the @entity44 , thousands have been killed in @entity46 drone strikes with almost no input from @entity18			2
during his defense speech , @entity1 vowed to help end the @entity16 for the @entity17 that set in motion the seemingly endless war the @entity13 has been fighting since 2001			1
this is some of the context of @entity1 's decision to go to @entity18 to seek authorization for a military strike on @entity26			1
@entity1 has wanted to leave office in 2016 as the president who had made it harder , not easier , for future presidents to go to war unilaterally without the input of @entity18			1
in going to @entity18 for authorization of any military operation in @entity26 , we see @entity1 the former constitutional law professor at work , but we also see @entity1 the pragmatist			1
opinion : @entity1 's @entity26 dilemma the @entity1 administration could have always made the argument in the past few days that it could justify attacking the regime of @entity73 on humanitarian grounds to prevent further massacres of the @entity26 people with chemical weapons despite the fact that there was no international authorization for attacking @entity26 and no congressional resolution sanctioning such an attack			1
but that argument would be a novel one as a matter of international law , and it would not be particularly compelling as a matter of domestic politics when the @entity13 public seems , at best , split on whether the @entity13 should deploy force in @entity26			2
unilateral @entity13 military actions are , of course , generally uncontroversial after an attack on @entity13 targets by a foreign power or group			0
president @entity97 did n't seek congressional approval for the cruise missiles he launched at @entity101 training camps in @entity23 in 1998 after the terrorist group 's attacks on two @entity13 embassies in @entity105			0
nor did president @entity106 go to @entity18 to sign off on his invasion of @entity108 in 1989 , which he authorized because a @entity13 , @entity109 had recently been killed there and tens of thousands of other @entity13 living in the country were purportedly at risk			2
opinion : @entity13 needs @entity115 approval on @entity26 @entity26 has n't attacked any @entity13 targets or citizens , so the argument that an attack on the @entity73 regime is designed to protect @entity13 interests or lives is moot			0
that leaves the @entity1 administration with the option of extracting some kind of authorization for an attack from international bodies such as the @entity115 , @entity130 or the @entity131			0
as is now well - known , there is n't a snowball 's chance in hell of getting a @entity115 authorization since @entity137 and @entity138 have continuously made clear they would veto such a resolution			0
there also seems little possibility , for the moment , that @entity130 will authorize a " humanitarian " mission as it did in @entity145 in 1999 to roll back @entity147 aggression there			0
and even if there was such an authorization , right now a major @entity130 member , the @entity151 , could n't participate because the @entity151 @entity152 voted against such a mission on thursday			0
indeed , @entity130 said monday it wants a " firm international response " in response to the use of chemical weapons in @entity26 , but that it wo n't take any military action itself			0
the @entity131 , which signed off on the operation to topple @entity161 in 2011 , has so far not signaled a readiness to authorize war against @entity26			0
@entity164 said the world community should take action against those responsible for the use of chemical weapons but did not specify if it would endorse military action by the @entity13 or other parties			0
that said , the usually hypercautious @entity173 publicly urged war on sunday			0
in going to @entity18 for the @entity26 authorization , we see not only the former constitutional law professor and pragmatist in @entity1 , but also the calculated risk taker			1
on matters of considerable importance where the potential payoff is large , @entity1 has shown he is willing to take risks			0
think no further than his decision two years ago to authorize a @entity186 raid to capture or kill @entity187 in @entity40 , a raid he undertook against the advice of vice president @entity190 and then - secretary of defense @entity191			1
if that operation had gone poorly , as a number of @entity1 's top national security officials believed it could , @entity1 might now be splitting his time between @entity196 and @entity197			1
for @entity1 , a congressional authorization on the use of force in @entity26 would help him if he needs to authorize additional military actions down the road in @entity26			2
it would also help him if he feels compelled to go to war with @entity206			0
of course , if he does n't get such an authorization , he will endure the same kind of humiliation that @entity151 prime minster @entity210 has just gone through in @entity152			0
is it ' @entity212 ' for @entity1 on @entity26 ? @entity1 has , however , no doubt tried to game out how this vote might play out			2
he probably calculates that for @entity218 skeptics in @entity18 , they will have to explain to the @entity13 public why it is that they will not sanction military action on @entity26 after its large - scale use of chemical weapons while they continue to describe @entity26 's closest ally , @entity206 , and its nuclear weapons program -- which still has yet to produce any nuclear weapons -- as a grave threat to the world			1
we can be sure that in the next days , the administration will make the argument that if you let @entity26 take a pass on its large - scale and repeated use of chemical weapons , you can forget any chance of slowing or ending @entity206 's nuclear program , something that is a matter of great importance for much of the @entity218			2
for those on the left of the @entity244 in @entity18 who are generally skeptical of @entity13 military actions , @entity1 can essentially ask , " if not now , when ? " at what point will self - described liberals intervene to stop the use of weapons so vile that they have been banned by the civilized world for almost a century ?			2

@entity253 : @entity1 's hope had been to end wars in @entity256
by *sending* issue to @entity18 , @entity1 seeks to make war harder to launch , @entity253 says
@entity261 : @entity1 lacked international support and legal standing to strike @entity26
@entity1 's move is a risk , as was decision to launch @entity187 raid , @entity253 says
