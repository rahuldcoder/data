-- " i got nowhere to go ever since i came back , " @entity0 growls over a warped - alloy guitar charge on " @entity3 , " the lead single from the first @entity6 album since 1996			1
he 's singing about @entity7 , about coming home after years away and feeling out of place in his own hometown			2
he 's also talking about a sound : the grunge his band helped define , and which once dominated rock 's mainstream			1
now , there is n't much of a rock mainstream left to dominate ; big , heavy , high - protein bands like @entity6 are all but extinct			1
which is exactly why " @entity24 " is a weirdly cool beast to encounter in 2012 -- like running into a mastodon in a @entity23 t - shirt			0
the band 's sound manages to be as ageless as it is anachronistic			1
@entity6 were the crusty hard - rock true believers amid alt - rock 's self - appointed revolutionaries : if @entity34 wanted to shred your world and @entity37 strove to redeem it , @entity0 , guitarist @entity31 , bassist @entity32 and drummer @entity33 wanted to take you out in the woods with a six - pack and headbang to @entity42			1
@entity24 shows they have n't forgotten how to stomp out the jams : @entity31 is still a warlock guitar conjurer of the first order , and @entity0 rolls around his multi-octave vocal range like some kind of backwoods metal - @entity49			0
the album follows their root sound down all kinds of mossy paths -- from the @entity57 - meets - @entity51 blues burn of " @entity58 " to " a thousand days before , " a snake - hipped meditation on the impermanence of life			1
naturally , its centerpiece moment is its heaviest : " blood on the @entity68 , " where sumptuously evil riffs fall like redwoods as @entity0 spools out images of war as mindless decadence			0
" the blood dries while we spill , " he sings			0
" @entity76 ranks all 24 @entity78 movies it 's a quintessentially @entity6 moment : overpowering but self - loathing			1
what made them " grunge " and not just a new kind of old metal was their dire , brutal despair			0
the band 's greatest songs -- miasmic punishers like " @entity89 " or " @entity90 , " from their 1994 watershed , @entity92 -- undercut massive music with lyrics about helplessness and depression			1
being @entity7 in the @entity97 , that helplessness suggested drug abuse			0
but " @entity24 " was recorded by sober dudes in their forties -- the hymnlike " @entity109 " is about the challenges of parenting , and " halfway there " is a matter - of - fact take on class stagnation : " something to eat ? / i would say you 're doing better than most , though maybe not as well as some , " @entity0 observes			0
the @entity111 of @entity112 that line could describe @entity0 's years @entity114 : supergroup success with @entity116 in @entity117 , then a decade wandering the post-alt - rock solo wilderness , complete with a @entity120 - produced @entity119 ( 2009 's @entity121 )			2
after years of failed reinvention , the guy on @entity24 sounds content to be himself			0
" do n't know where i 'm going / i just keep on rowing , " he moans like a mantra , awash in black swirls of industrial - strength murk on the album 's closing track			2
it 's that old - time sludge that carries him home			2
