-- forces loyal to @entity6 's former leader , @entity5 , used a lull in fighting this week as a " trick " to reinforce their positions around the main city of @entity11 , the head of @entity3 peacekeeping operations said friday			1
though @entity5 's men said tuesday they wanted a peaceful solution to the months - long fighting in @entity6 , they soon restarted shelling both the @entity3 headquarters and the civilian population , @entity12 told reporters at the @entity3			1
forces loyal to @entity5 have since regained control of two central areas of @entity11 and fighting is continuing , @entity23 said , after briefing the @entity24 on developments in the cocoa - producing nation			1
" they have clearly used the lull of tuesday as a trick to reinforce their position , " he said			1
most areas of the capital , however , are now under @entity3 or @entity37 military control , journalist @entity33 reported from the @entity37 military base in @entity39			2
the @entity37 military has been working to reconnect the disrupted water and electricity supply in what is the country 's main city			0
@entity33 traveled with the @entity37 military through @entity11 on friday and reported seeing civilians in the streets , including one woman selling food , which he took as a positive sign			0
there appeared to be a standoff , however , outside @entity11 's @entity53 , where @entity5 's rival and the internationally recognized president , @entity55 , is staying under @entity3 protection , @entity33 reported			1
he said @entity5 's forces are outside the hotel			1
@entity23 said that if that hotel comes under attack , the @entity3 may have to consider using force against @entity5 and his men			1
pro-gbagbo forces have heavy weapons including tanks , mortars , and rocket - propelled grenades and are using them " as we speak against the civilian population " and @entity3 headquarters , @entity23 said			1
" those who are saying there are no more heavy weapons -- that mr. @entity5 has no more heavy weapons -- it 's a lie , " he said			2
earlier , @entity37 military sources said the @entity37 ambassador 's residence in @entity11 came under attack by forces loyal to @entity5 , but a @entity5 spokesman said that was " impossible " because @entity3 forces are surrounding all the ambassadors ' residences			1
the spokesman , @entity84 , said the @entity3 forces fired on the state television station , which is in the same block as both the @entity37 ambassador 's residence and @entity5 's residence , and that they have broken the antennae			1
" the national tv station was destroyed by the last attack ( two days ago ) , " @entity84 said			0
" right now it is still working , and the @entity37 do n't want the national tv to work any more and they are now preparing an attack			0
" @entity23 said 23 countries have requested @entity3 help in moving their personnel to safer areas of @entity11			2
those countries include @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , the @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , and @entity108			0
@entity3 forces also offered to relocate the 35 journalists who were at the @entity111 in @entity11 , he said			2
many accepted the offer but some have stayed behind			0
the @entity3 is still hoping political dialogue will resolve the situation , said @entity117 , @entity118 's ambassador and current president of the @entity24			2
" we hope that additional political actions will be taken , but still the great difficulty here is the absolute reluctance of mr. @entity5 to recognize the legitimacy of mr. @entity55 , " @entity117 said friday			1
@entity37 foreign minister @entity126 expressed his nation 's full support of @entity55 on friday and said the situation in the country " remains serious			2
" " the militia paid by @entity5 continues abuses , looting , and assassinations , " he said			2
" the population lives in very precarious conditions			0
massive humanitarian aid will be needed pending the reconstruction			0
" @entity126 's words came amid a disturbing new report of the type of killings and abuses that have plagued @entity6 since the disputed november election			2
more than 100 bodies were recovered in the past 24 hours in western @entity6 , the @entity145 said friday			0
human rights teams found 15 more bodies in @entity149 , the cocoa - rich town where last week several agencies reported a massacre of as many as 800 people			0
the @entity3 rights agency said that so far , 244 bodies have been recovered from that incident , the bloodiest episode yet			2
the victims are believed to have been mostly or all @entity160 people , who have traditionally supported @entity5 , and some of the victims were burned alive , the @entity3 said			1
in the town of @entity167 , human rights investigators said , the perpetrators of killings were @entity169 mercenaries who separated the @entity160 from the rest and spared them from slaughter			0
@entity23 said a commission of inquiry will be appointed soon to investigate the killings			0
a report by @entity176 , released late friday , backed up the @entity3 claims			1
it said forces loyal to both @entity55 and @entity5 are responsible for " serious abuses " including the killing and rape of those believed to support the other side			1
the report pinned most of the blame , however , on supporters of the internationally recognized president			0
" people interviewed by @entity176 described how , in village after village , @entity192 forces ... summarily executed and raped perceived @entity5 supporters in their homes , as they worked in the fields , as they fled , or as they tried to hide in the bush , " the human rights group said			1
" the fighters often targeted people by ethnicity , and the attacks disproportionally affected those too old or feeble to flee			0
" the group urged @entity55 to open an investigation into abuses by both sides as soon as he takes power			1
" while the international community has been focused on the political stalemate in @entity11 over the presidency , forces on both sides have committed numerous atrocities against civilians , their leaders showing little interest in reining them in , " said @entity208 , @entity104 director for @entity176			1
" @entity55 should send a strong message to ( his forces ) that such abuses will be fully punished at home or by an international tribunal			1
" nearly 150,000 people have now fled their homes amid @entity6 's war , displaced within the country or seeking refuge in neighboring nations , the @entity3 refugee agency said friday			2
refugees said they were tired , hungry and exhausted after arriving in @entity169 's @entity231 , which is along the border at the @entity234 coast			0
some arrived by foot , others by canoe			0
some reported seeing dead bodies along the way			0
sporadic gunfire rang out friday in @entity11 , the nation 's largest city , where @entity5 remained hunkered down in the basement of his residence , guarded by about 200 of his men			2
despite being surrounded by @entity55 's troops and receiving a warning from the @entity3 secretary - general that he should seize his last chance for a graceful exit , @entity5 showed no willingness to budge			1
@entity55 has blamed @entity5 for @entity6 's suffering			1
he told citizens this week he ordered the military and police to safeguard public places including hospitals and markets			0
the november presidential election had been expected to help unify the @entity261 nation , which is rebounding from a 2002 civil war			0
instead , the disputed vote sliced the nation in two			0
sporadic post-election violence erupted into all - out war after @entity55 's troops launched an offensive that swept through the country to @entity11 on the coast			1
on friday , at @entity55 's request , the @entity269 lifted sanctions on @entity6 entities , including two key ports			1
" under the measures adopted today , the ports of @entity11 and @entity276 , the @entity277 and the @entity278 are removed from the list of entities subject to the @entity269 assets freeze , " an @entity269 statement read			0
@entity0 's @entity283 , @entity284 , @entity285 , and @entity286 contributed to this report .			0
