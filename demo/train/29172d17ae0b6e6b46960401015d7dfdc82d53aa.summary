@entity0 -- @entity2 is n't nervous			1
as befits a singer playing a principal role in a major opera production , he suffers the last - minute adjustments to makeup , hair and wardrobe			1
then finally he is left alone to prepare for this night 's performance of @entity13 's " @entity12			1
" alone except for his mother			0
@entity2 is just 12 years old			1
" it 's really fun to sing , " the ' tween confides , as he runs through a series of scales and brief snatches of the music that he will soon be performing on stage			0
his voice is high , crisp and crystal clear			0
and behind the voice is a power and control that seem almost alien in one so young			0
@entity29 music director @entity28 briefly peeks into the dressing room to wish young @entity2 good luck			1
" places please ... " echoes through the dressing rooms and sends @entity2 scurrying through a maze of backstage cables to the massive turntable stage that will soon deliver him to the spotlight			2
@entity2 's professional singing career began just a couple of years ago			2
he had been singing in a boys ' choir in his native @entity40 , @entity41			0
it was one activity among many along with soccer and learning guitar			0
the @entity47 company was holding auditions for " @entity12 " and @entity2 's choirmaster suggested he give it a try			1
" i had a very vague idea even what opera was , " @entity2 remembers , " all i got was the version i got in school of the fat lady singing			1
" @entity2 won the role of @entity57 , a troubled boy threatened by menacing ghosts in a rambling @entity60 country home			1
it is a pivotal role in the production			1
he also starred in the premier performance of " the @entity65 , " an operatic version of " @entity65			1
" @entity28 says only a handful of boys are capable of taking on operatic roles			1
" you have to find somebody whose voice is strong enough , and somebody who can sing at all levels with a very focused tone			0
and @entity2 fits all of those characteristics			2
" " he was always making goofy noises all the time , from the time he was a toddler , " says @entity2 's mother , @entity77			2
@entity2 says she is n't sure where @entity2 came by his musical talent			2
" i 'm not musical at all , " she says , " when he sings i 'm almost useless in helping him			0
" an opera career has meant occasional separations from the rest of his family , as @entity2 and his mom travel the opera circuit			1
" i do n't have too much contact with kids my age , " @entity2 says			2
" i 'm always working with adults ... i miss that a little			0
but i think it 's worth it			0
" @entity2 works hard in rehearsals , enjoys the performances and loves the applause			2
" he is lucky that he found something that he is so good at at so young an age , " says his mom			0
by almost any measure , @entity2 's rise in the world of opera has been meteoric			1
as soon as his role in " @entity12 " ends in @entity0 , he 's off to @entity108 and a @entity110 production of " @entity111			1
" but how long can it last ? it wo n't be long before the boy soprano 's voice changes			0
what then ? it will be a challenge , but , " it may be better , " @entity2 says			0
" in opera you can sing even if you are old			0
" and @entity2 is already thinking about a whole new world of roles he could sing as an adult .			0
