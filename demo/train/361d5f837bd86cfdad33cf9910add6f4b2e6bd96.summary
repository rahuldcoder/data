@entity0 had every reason to stay home in @entity4			1
a pair of young daughters , one of them just 3 - weeks old			0
yet , in his mind , he had to go into war - torn @entity12			1
the experienced journalist explained why in a video shot in october from southern @entity16			2
he felt compelled to tell the stories of war in all its trauma , complexity and humanity			0
" @entity12 people ( have been ) suffering for three years and a half			2
it 's enough , " the 47 - year - old @entity0 explained			1
" so i would like to get the story of what @entity26 wants to do			2
" so @entity0 crossed the border into @entity12 and headed toward the @entity31 extremist group 's de facto capital of @entity32 , despite the advice of friend , @entity35 , who 'd been with him previously in that nation			1
@entity35 recalled telling @entity0 , " it 's not safe for you			1
" the journalist replied that he did n't feel he was in danger			2
after all , his native @entity4 -- unlike the @entity43 government and the international coalition supporting it -- was n't involved in the military fight against the terrorist group that 's branded itself as the @entity48			1
" i am not @entity49			0
i am @entity4 , " @entity0 said , according to @entity35 , " i can go			2
" it appears to have been a mistake			0
a new @entity26 video released saturday appeared to show the decapitated body of @entity55			1
while the authenticity of the video could not immediately be established by @entity1 , @entity4 officials did not challenge news of his apparent death			0
" we are deeply saddened by this despicable and horrendous act of terrorism and we denounce it in the strongest terms , " prime minister @entity62 said in @entity63			0
@entity0 covered big news stories for years , hoping that by telling them he could make a difference in the world			2
his work was featured by numerous @entity4 organizations , including broadcaster @entity74			0
and he was n't afraid to put himself in harm 's way to tell a story			2
one need just look to his previous trip to @entity12 , where a bloody , complicated civil war has gone on for four years			2
the @entity82 estimated in august that nearly 200,000 had been killed , more than 3 million @entity12 had become refugees and at least 6.5 million were displaced inside the country			0
while there , @entity0 came to know another @entity4 man , a 42 - year - old aspiring security contractor @entity87			1
according to @entity89 's friend @entity88 , @entity0 passed along insights on how to survive in @entity12 and introduced him to rebel fighters , who are distinct from @entity26 though both are fighting @entity12 president @entity94 's forces			1
the fact the two @entity4 men 's paths had crossed again became public january 20 in an @entity26 video posted to social media			1
it shows @entity0 and @entity89 dressed in orange , kneeling in front of a masked , black - clad man			1
in it , the @entity26 militant gives the @entity4 government a choice to pay $ 200 million -- the same amount of money prime minister @entity62 recently pledged for those " contending " with @entity26 -- to free the @entity4 men within 72 hours			0
days later , a new message was posted by known @entity26 supporters featuring the voice of someone claiming to be @entity0			1
and so soon would @entity0 , the new message claimed -- unless @entity117 's government freed its longtime prisoner , @entity118 , a convicted terrorist			1
on saturday , the latest @entity26 video showed the masked man blaming @entity4 's humanitarian support of coalition efforts in @entity43 and @entity12 for @entity0 's apparent beheading			1
@entity4 's government insisted it did everything within reason that it could to bring @entity55 home safely			0
the fate of @entity129 , a @entity117 pilot recently captured by @entity26 while on a military mission targeting the @entity31 extremist group , is unclear			1
he was not shown or mentioned in the video			0
speaking out for the first time thursday , @entity0 's wife , @entity135 , said her husband " was taken from me october 25 " although she did n't know it until a december 2 message from his captors landed in her inbox			1
now , after working " tirelessly behind the scenes , " she went public to " beg the @entity117 and @entity4 governments to understand that the fates of both ( @entity55 and @entity145 ) are in their hands			0
" her statement comes after she got another email wednesday with the hostage takers ' " final demand			0
" " our baby girl was only 3 weeks old when @entity0 left			0
i hope our oldest daughter , who is just 2 , will get to see her father again , " @entity135 said on thursday			0
" i want them both to grow up knowing their father			0
" as to why @entity0 left in the first place , his wife said , " my husband is a good and honest man who went to @entity12 to show the plight of those who suffer			1
i believe that @entity0 may have also been trying to find out about @entity87 's situation			2
... i know all too well what ( @entity89 's relatives ) are going through			0
" the @entity4 captive 's mother , @entity166 , had spoken out previously trying to save a man she insists " is not the enemy of @entity26			1
" while @entity0 's decision to go to @entity12 surprised his mother , his rationale did not			1
@entity166 said , " @entity0 always has been a kind person , ever since he was little			0
he was always saying , ' i want to save the lives of children in war zones			0
' " and now @entity0 has become a victim in a war , a fact that 's tearing @entity166 apart			2
" i 'm shedding tears of sorrow , i just ca n't think of any words to say but i do n't want this sorrow to create a chain of hatred , " she said saturday			1
" @entity0 worked for children who suffered from conflicts and poverty , and his goal was to create a society without war			0
i want to pass on his thoughts to people around the world			0
" who is @entity117 pilot @entity129 , captured by @entity26 ?			2

@entity0 's mother says she does n't want her tears to spawn a " chain of hatred "
journalist crossed into @entity26 - controlled @entity12 to cover what 's happening there
@entity26 captured him , and a purported video from the group *threatened* his life
