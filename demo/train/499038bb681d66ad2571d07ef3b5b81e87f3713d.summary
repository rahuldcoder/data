@entity0 -- the end is coming for radio and tv icon @entity3			1
he 's suffering from dementia and bedsores , and his body is shutting down at a hospital in @entity12 , court documents say			2
on wednesday , a @entity14 judge gave daughter @entity15 the authority to have doctors end his infusions of water , food and medicine			1
the ruling reinstates the 82 - year - old 's end - of - life health directive			1
@entity3 's doctor concluded that continuing the artificial nutrition and hydration would only " at best prolong the dying process for him and will certainly add suffering to an already terribly uncomfortable dying process , " said @entity15 's lawyer , @entity31			1
" the court 's decision today upheld our father 's explicit wishes as expressed by him in his health directive , " @entity15 said in a statement after the hearing			2
she was referring to a directive her father signed in 2007 , saying he would not want to be kept alive if it " would result in a mere biological existence , devoid of cognitive function , with no reasonable hope for normal functioning			0

" this document , which snubbed @entity3 's wife , set the stage for the legal battle that would erupt six years later as his health deteriorated and his children accused their stepmother of shutting them out of their father 's life			1
it would serve as a legal basis for his daughter to have doctors discontinue infusions of water , food and medicine			1
