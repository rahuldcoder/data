@entity0 is one of the strangest places you 'll ever be able to explore -- and few can			1
this eerie , desolate place of deserted tower blocks some 17 kilometers ( 10.5 miles ) off the coast of @entity8 in western @entity9 was opened to tourists four years ago but access is strictly limited			1
the buildings are too decrepit , so tourists skirt a defined path around one corner of the island			2
only with special permission from @entity19 can you pick your way through the apartment blocks and climb the so - called " @entity26 " to get a proper view of the ruins from the wind - battered shrine at the top			0
it is a scene more of devastation than decay when viewed from above			0
decades of typhoons and sea water erosion have torn at the concrete high - rises			0
foundations hammered deep into the ocean to support the huge concrete structures stand exposed			0
@entity37 , which once lined balconies , lies in piles where the wind has left it			0
take a wrong turn and you 'll find yourself on narrow paths connecting one rooftop with another , vertiginous drops on either side			0
if you have any fear of heights at all , it 's the kind of situation where you might prefer to inch down to ground level on your hands and knees rather than your feet			2
however this scene will seem strangely familiar to @entity60 fans -- @entity0 served as the inspiration for the villain 's home in the latest 007 movie " @entity65			1
" the courtyard of building number 65 is where one unfortunate @entity60 girl meets a sticky end			0
according to @entity19 , location scouts came a number of times to scope the island but decided it was too dangerous for filming			2
so @entity0 sets remarkably close to the real thing were built at @entity79 instead			1
the once bustling island community 's raison d'Ãªtre was coal			1
the first mine shaft was dug here in 1887			1
three years later @entity9 engineering giant @entity85 bought @entity0 and transformed it into a highly efficient mining facility housing workers and their families in some of the world 's earliest concrete high - rises			1
the island expanded as @entity9 's demand for coal grew -- upwards in a forest of apartment blocks and outwards by a series of land reclamations			1
though today weeds and plants have taken root in derelict balconies and rooftops , children then knew only grey			2
" there were no bushes , no flowers , we did n't even know what the cherry blossom was , " recalled @entity104 , who was born on @entity0 in 1932			1
" we told the seasons from one another by listening to the wind or looking at the color of the ocean and the sky			0
" the period of @entity117 's childhood was also the darkest in @entity0 's history			1
like many of imperial @entity9 's industrial facilities , @entity0 was a destination for hundreds of @entity122 forced laborers			1
during @entity127 , @entity125 prisoners of war joined their ranks			1
for them , @entity0 was a desperate place			1
in the peace museum at @entity8 , testimonies from @entity122 forced laborers line the walls , collated by museum director @entity134			0
" the common stories i heard from @entity122 and @entity125 laborers was that they are enormously hungry			0
the meals were miserable and when they could not go to work they were tortured , punched and kicked			0
" @entity104 's best friend at school was @entity122			2
he says he did n't see much discrimination against @entity144 but he remembers his parents talking about one episode when a @entity122 worker was beaten			0
" my father and mother were saying how sorry they were but my @entity151 said it was inevitable because it is wartime			0
" he remembers resenting the @entity125 as a child because they were " locked up in the southern part of the island , right where we used to play baseball			2
we were so upset they took our place to play , but after the war ended i learned they were forced to work there			0
" @entity104 only left the island in 1974 when the mine closed down			1
@entity166 had replaced coal as @entity9 's major fuel source			1
@entity85 pulled out , the workers found jobs on the mainland and @entity0 was left to rot			1
" it was an energy revolution and we all knew in our hearts that it was end for coal , " said @entity104			2
" if i were to describe it in one word , it was just sad			0
even now i still see it as a once in a lifetime thing , living on that island			2
" read more : @entity0 's dark history @entity185 only lived on @entity0 for a year in 1961 but he knows the paths in and around the ruins inside out			1
well into his seventies he picks his way through the rubble , pointing out the oddities that were part of everyday life -- the baths where the water was always black because the miners would jump in fully clothed at the end of a long day ; the spots on the fortified walls where lovers would eek out a privacy of sorts to watch the sun go down			0
this was the period when @entity0 was one of the most densely populated places on earth -- 5,259 people living on just 16 acres at its peak in 1959			1
" it reminded me of @entity213			0
cooking hours were quite noisy			0
wives would borrow seasoning and exchange food they could n't finish			0
no one needed to lock the door			0
" @entity185 now works for @entity220 , one of the tour operators that bring tourists to the island			2
he says he 'll tell visitors about the forced labor issue but he wo n't dwell on it			0
" there were so many other sides to life on the island beyond that , " he said			0
but it remains a sore point			0
@entity9 wants @entity0 recognized as a @entity235 world heritage site but @entity122 objects			1
@entity134 says @entity9 needs to address the issue with more honesty			2
" @entity239 is registered as world heritage site so people can remember the historical crime			0
as for @entity0 , some seem not to want to remember that dark side and focus instead on its contribution as a locomotive of @entity9 's industrialization			1
that 's a betrayal of history			2
" @entity9 was required to pay reparations to the countries it wronged during @entity127 as part of a series of post-war treaties			1
on the 50th anniversary of the end of the war , @entity9 's prime minister @entity257 offered a general apology for the " tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries , particularly to those of @entity267 nations ' caused by its ' colonial rule and aggression			1
' " but there have been several recent lawsuits , filed by @entity125 workers against @entity85 , demanding compensation and a specific apology for their enslavement in facilities across the @entity9 empire during the war			1
@entity185 may be right to say there is a lot more to @entity0 's history than the forced labor that tarnished its earlier years			1
it may not have been any worse a place necessarily than any of the other forced labor locations around the @entity288			0
but as it crumbles slowly into the ocean , the island 's concrete towers are an eerie symbol of a war wound that has not yet healed .			2

@entity0 , on @entity9 's @entity296 , opened its first coal mine in 1887
@entity85 turned it into a mining facility housing workers and their families
island also the inspiration for the villain 's home in the latest 007 movie " @entity65 "
but the island , now derelict , has a darker history relating to slave labor during @entity127
