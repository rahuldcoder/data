-- the @entity1 is arguably the world 's most dangerous motorsport race , but for one newcomer it can not compare with what he has already been through			1
@entity7 soldier @entity6 will be co-driving in the 16 - day event , which traverses the mountainous desert terrain of @entity10 , despite losing both his legs and an arm after standing on a booby trap while serving in @entity14 in 2008			1
he effectively died three times , and had to be resuscitated on each occasion on the operating table back at base			2
" i think the @entity19 's less dangerous than what i 've done , and i think i knew what i was getting myself into when i signed up for it , " @entity6 told @entity0			1
" saying that , most of the guys i 've spoken to about the @entity19 never do it again , so it 's clearly not easy			2
" founder @entity27 described the grueling endurance event as " a challenge for those who go , a dream for those who stay behind			2
" a total of 25 competitors have lost their lives since the inaugural race started in @entity37 in late 1978 , and more than 50 people overall including spectators			1
only 74 of the 182 entrants for that first staging made it as far as the @entity44 capital @entity19			1
@entity45 himself died during the 1986 race when the helicopter in which he was traveling was struck by a sudden sandstorm			1
traditionally , the race wound its way from @entity53 down to the south - west of @entity54 , but was relocated to @entity10 in 2009 because of terrorist threats			1
this year 's 33rd staging will start on january 5 in @entity57 , @entity58 , and finish in the @entity60 capital of @entity61			1
@entity62 is well aware of the rigors of rallying -- he has only just recovered from a broken arm after crashing badly at one of his warmup events -- but it pales into insignificance compared to what he experienced on july 22 , 2008			1
" we were on a routine patrol when we came under enemy fire , " recalls @entity6 , who is one of five injured military personnel taking part in the 2013 race			1
" i was part of the sniper team and moved into position to provide covering fire for my fellow troops			1
" the area i went to was already cleared by metal detectors where there was a sandbag			2
i asked for it to be checked again and it was			2
then i lifted the sandbag and the blast took off my feet and badly damaged my left arm			1
" at the time , the first thing i checked was my cock and balls			2
once i saw my feet were n't there , i was more focused on just stopping the bleeding than worrying about not walking again			2
i remember joking around -- as i 'm into my cars -- that i would n't be driving my @entity100 anytime soon			2
" it 's odd to think there 's that sort of banter just after getting blown up			2
there was n't any panic , it was all very straightforward			2
" i remember i was conscious throughout the whole thing			2
i was surprisingly okay and chatting to the medic throughout			0
it was then that i felt i 'd be okay despite quite heavy blood loss			0
i 'd been blown up a couple of times before but obviously this one was a lot more serious			0
" having been restored to full health , @entity62 will compete for the @entity116 team , with funds raised going towards injured servicemen and women			1
he will be the navigator for able - bodied driver @entity121 for the 8,000 - kilometer event			1
the challenging route has desert stages virtually from the outset , then goes through gaucho territory in @entity127 after crossing the @entity128 before the challenge of the @entity60 dunes			1
despite the dangers of the race , for some its lure is just too much			1
former @entity7 prime minister @entity135 's son @entity134 was a notable entry in 1982 , when he went missing for six days along with his co-driver and mechanic			1
after being spotted by a @entity140 air force plane , @entity135 downplayed the severity of the incident , insisting that all he needed was " a sandwich , a bath and a shave			0
" @entity146 of @entity147 was another high - profile entry three years later along with five - time @entity150 cycle race winner @entity149 in 1986 and @entity152 rock singer @entity151 in 2002			1
former @entity152 international rugby player @entity153 competed in the motorbike category from 2009 - 11			1
" i did n't worry about accidents			0
i did n't think about that at all			0
i did n't really worry about the dangers until the end as there 's no point worrying about these things as that 's when things go wrong , " he said			0
" for me , the @entity19 was always a dream			0
when i played rugby , i used to say , ' guys , one day i will do the @entity19 and they 'd be like ' @entity166 , do n't be crazy , you 'll never do it , you 're a liar			0
' " when they heard i 'd entered they again said i was crazy but i did n't feel crazy			0
i just loved the whole experience			0
i was like nothing else			0
" this year 's entry list features almost 200 competitors in the motorbike class , 115 in the cars , 40 in the quad bikes and 176 in the trucks			0
the amateur element accounts for about 80 % of the entrants -- including @entity181 , who planned to be on his honeymoon during the race but put his wedding plans on hold after receiving a late wildcard entry			1
" i 'm grateful towards my wife - to - be because this is unthinkable in @entity190 , but we postponed the marriage so that i could take part in the rally , " he explained			1
it is not just an event for the competitors -- the 2013 version will be televised in 189 countries , with an audience of 2.2 billion from start to finish			0
but it will once again attract criticism , as has been customary since @entity45 first came up with the idea after getting lost on his motorbike in 1977 in @entity208 desert during another event , the @entity210			1
@entity152 's @entity211 once described it as " colonialism that needs to be eradicated " while the @entity213 once called it " a vulgar display of power and wealth in places where men continue to die from hunger and thirst			0
" the race 's history is entwined with tragedy			1
the helicopter crash which accounted for @entity45 's death also led to the death of four others on board			0
just two years later , six people lost their lives , including a 10 - year - old @entity232 girl struck by a competitor 's car , and a mother and daughter killed when hit by a television crew 's vehicle			1
but for those who take part , the risks are part of the excitement			2
@entity244 , runner - up in the motorbike class in 1980 , said fear was the biggest lure of the @entity19			2
" the piste is like the ocean , " he said			0
" it is wrong not to fear it			0
as for me , the piste makes me scared -- you do n't mess around with it			0
you ca n't be an artist			0
" the race 's most successful entrant is @entity261 , a six - time winner of the motorcycle category who also has four car titles , including last year			1
the @entity152 , 47 , describes his @entity19 years as " the most memorable of my life , " reveling in the " complete emptiness , nothingness " of the desert tundra at night			0
while @entity261 will once again hope to make the headlines , @entity62 is likely to be one of the unsung battlers just trying to make it home			0
" i 've always been a petrolhead and did motocross as a kid , " he says			0
" since recovering from my injuries , the @entity19 has been the dream			0
" most people do n't get to do that but i 've got the chance			0
for me , the main thing is just to finish			0

@entity1 begins in @entity58 capital on january 5 and finishes 15 days later in @entity60

@entity7 soldier lost both legs and an arm during active duty in @entity14 in 2008
