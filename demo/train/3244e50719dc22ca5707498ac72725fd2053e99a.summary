-- @entity1 is fed up with the trolls			1
the founder and editor - in - chief of the @entity5 says that starting next month , she will require readers to identify themselves by name in the comments sections of her eponymous news site			1
@entity1 made the off - the - cuff comment in a q&a session after a speech wednesday to a crowd of 4,000 at a conference in @entity15 , according to spokeswoman @entity16 of @entity17 , a marketing software company that hosts the conference			1
" freedom of expression is given to people who stand up for what they 're saying and who are not hiding behind anonymity , " @entity1 told the audience			1
" maintaining a civil environment for real conversation and community has always been key to the @entity5			1
" from day one , our comments were pre-moderated , and we invested in the most advanced moderation technology along with human moderators , " she said			2
" now we want to go a step further to evolve our platform -- which has always been about community and engagement -- to meet the needs of the grown - up @entity39			0
" in other words , the @entity39 " trolls , " or nasty anonymous commenters , have gotten worse			2
the @entity43 , which covered @entity1 's speech , quoted her as saying that " trolls have become more and more aggressive and uglier			1
" websites have long grappled with how to police users who hijack comment threads with posts that range from snarky to untruthful to downright vicious , their animosity protected by anonymity			0
sites like @entity53 and @entity54 got the ax after existing for several years as hosts for anonymous gossip			0
in recent years the problem has taken tragic turns , as cyberbullying on social media and other platforms has been blamed for several suicides			0
a @entity5 spokesperson confirmed to @entity0 that the site 's new policy will be implemented next month			1
the spokesperson would not elaborate on specifics of the plan other than to say , " our engineers are working on the exact implementation plan and we will share that as soon as it is finalized			0
" many news sites have moderating systems that remove offensive comments , and some sites have sought to make commenters more accountable by requiring them to register via an account on @entity79 or other social platform			2
@entity0 requires people to create accounts to participate in discussions on @entity0 , but it 's not a foolproof system , says @entity85 , community manager for @entity86			2
" we think it 's really important to listen to the conversations our stories start on @entity0			2
there are a lot of smart people in our audience with unique perspectives , so their comments can be a valuable resource , " @entity85 said			2
" trolls are pretty unpleasant , but the bigger problem is that they make it harder to find and surface interesting conversations , " he added			0
" we are always looking for ways to improve the quality of the conversations on our sites			0
" since its launch in 2005 , the @entity5 has garnered 260 million comments from its online community of readers , according to the spokesperson			1
the site 's current comment policy is clearly stated online , with guidelines for users that include " be yourself , only yourself , and just one of yourself " as well as " if your comments consistently or intentionally make this community a less civil and enjoyable place to be , you and your comments will be excluded from it			1
" @entity1 's decision to prohibit anonymous comments is better than banning all comments , said @entity125 , a media expert and sociology professor at @entity128 in suburban @entity15			1
" it 's valuable that she is not shutting down comments altogether , though it 's sort of a @entity139 , " said @entity125 , who believes that people who really want to post offensive messages will still find a way to do that make other efforts to post their opinions			1
in the digital age it 's not difficult to create a pseudonym tied to a secondary e-mail address			0
" the ability to speak anonymously online is not just for trolls , " @entity125 added			0
many people turn to the anonymity of the internet for meaningful dialogue about sensitive topics , such as politics or impropriety in the workplace , that prove difficult to discuss face to face , she said			0
@entity1 's views on news - site commenters seem a little less charitable than they were in 2010 , when she told @entity0 , " as a writer , i love the instant feedback			1
it makes the site a two - way experience			0
people no longer want to just passively sit back and be served up information			0
we now engage with news , react to news , and share news			0
news has become something around which we gather , connect , and converse			0
