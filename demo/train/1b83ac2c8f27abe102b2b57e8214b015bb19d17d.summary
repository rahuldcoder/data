@entity0 , @entity1 -- three nurses saw it this way -- it was a gut reaction that led to a kick in the guts			2
the suburban @entity1 maternity ward nurses testified tuesday they were simply trying to protect @entity10 's infant , whose head was bobbing as his father tried to take him outside the hospital , allegedly without permission			1
that 's when @entity10 kicked one of them and twisted the arm of another , they testified			1
it was the second day of @entity10 's criminal trial on misdemeanor charges of harassment and child endangerment resulting from what happened in january at @entity26 in @entity0 , about 40 miles north of @entity27			1
one of the nurses , @entity29 , said that as @entity10 tried to get past the nurses and into the stairwell , his infant 's head was being jostled , unsupported , in his arms			1
she testified that she instinctively reached out to steady it when @entity10 kicked her squarely in the pelvis			1
@entity10 lawyer says nurses should be disciplined nurse @entity40 said she saw @entity10 kick @entity41 with " such force " that it knocked her off her feet			1
the third nurse , @entity45 , testified @entity10 twisted her arm off the stairwell door as he tried to leave			1
" the baby was bouncing around in mr. @entity10 's arms , " she testified , explaining why the three nurses tried to intervene			1
prosecutors say the nurses were simply following hospital protocol set up in newborns ' interests when they tried to keep infant @entity55 from being taken out of the hospital			2
not only did @entity10 not back down , prosecutors say , but he fought back			2
@entity10 removed the baby 's electronic security bracelet and laid it on the counter before he headed for the elevators , prosecutors say			2
the nurses were trying to enforce hospital rules when they stopped him from using the elevators , and that 's when he headed for the stairs , they say			2
once he kicked the nurse , @entity10 only got as far as the next landing when hospital security stopped him , @entity68 testified monday			1
defense lawyer @entity72 suggested monday that @entity10 was calm during the situation , and that things only deteriorated because of @entity68			1
it was @entity10 's instinct , not @entity68 's , to protect his baby from being ripped from his arms , she said in her opening statement			1
@entity10 's attorney has previously said the nurses initially agreed to let @entity10 take the baby outside			1
but their attorney , @entity82 , has said neither @entity68 nor @entity41 recognized @entity10 as the child 's father			2
@entity40 , who witnessed the alleged assault , said she could n't understand why @entity10 would want to take his newborn outside for " fresh air " at 7 or 7:30 in the evening			1
" i did n't understand why he tried to do it , " she testified			0
there is a host of procedures before a baby can be discharged , @entity68 said			0
a supervisor needs to approve it , forms need to be signed and family members , including the infant 's mother , need to agree			0
none of the procedures was followed , she said			0
@entity68 testified she asked @entity10 to identify his baby , @entity55 , by his hospital bracelet , and to go back to his mother so she could match the names			2
she said she asked him to put @entity55 in a bassinet and go back to the room			0
he refused both times , she said			0
infant alarm systems are standard in many hospitals as a way to protect the babies ' safety			0
newborns wear electronic bracelets that cause alarms to sound and doors to be locked if the baby is taken out of the ward , and newborns are often released only to the mother , whose bracelet must match the baby 's			0
the defense noted @entity68 and @entity41 hired a personal injury lawyer before any charges were brought , suggesting it was intended to put pressure on the police and district attorney to charge @entity10			1
that would be leverage for a future civil suit , according to the defense			0
the defense also questioned why , if recounting her story was so emotionally difficult , @entity41 laid it out on @entity139 's " @entity138 " soon afterward			0
" i felt that my reputation was being defamed , like i had done something wrong or horrible , " @entity41 explained tuesday			0
she said she wanted " more clarification to know i did the right thing			0
i did what was best for the baby			0
" @entity10 is the youngest son of the late @entity148 , who was the younger brother of slain president @entity149 and had served as @entity151 attorney general and @entity151 senator			1
he was assassinated in 1968 while campaigning for the @entity154 presidential nomination			0
the trial is set to continue wednesday			0
day one of trial : abusive or protective ?			0

one nurse says he kicked her and another says he twisted her arm
