-- nobody found out who shot @entity3 on @entity4			0
and none of us first saw @entity7 wake up with @entity8 in an @entity10 photo			0
but that was then and this , in all its @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 - centric glory , is now			1
in 2014 , technology has handed us unprecedented flexibility in how we keep up with our favorite shows			1
but it 's also making it harder than ever to avoid walking headlong into spoilers			1
one social - media click , and you can spoil some of television 's biggest moments for other people who may be enjoying the same shows at a more leisurely pace			1
despite the wealth of tech - driven options for watching and sharing tv , we still ca n't seem to agree on the proper etiquette for how to chat online about it without ruining it for somebody else			1
some of us count ourselves among the @entity37 : " enjoyed the show ? well , shut up about it , unless you know you 're talking with ( or typing to ) someone else who 's already seen it			1
" ( full disclosure : that 's coming from someone who , as an excitable lad , responded to a question about " @entity49 , " with , " it was great ! but @entity51 dies			2
" ) at the other end of the spectrum is the @entity54 : " do n't want to be spoiled ? then watch the show when it airs or stay off social media until you do			2
@entity59 's hair on ' @entity60 ' is particularly luscious tonight and i must tell the world ! " then there are all the other folks who fall somewhere in the middle			2
so , let 's try to find a happy medium , shall we ? here are some tips for both the potential spoiler and the potential spoilee to help keep all of us tv watchers spoiler - free			1
twitter if you 're a spoiler : go there			2
unlike other social platforms , we 've all pretty much agreed that @entity14 is where you go to talk about tv shows while they 're happening			1
just log on during the @entity82 , the @entity83 , a presidential debate or any other big tv event and you 'll see why ceo @entity86 said the site is saving live television			1
sure , we 've got all that tech that lets us watch later			0
but part of the fun for the @entity93 's most dedicated couch potatoes has become watching @entity14 's real - time chatter about their favorite shows			1
if you 're a spoilee : do n't go there			2
the place is a 140 - character wild , wild @entity100			2
if you follow anyone who likes the same shows you do ( and why would you not ? ) , do n't log on until you 're caught up			1
' spoiler alert ' if you 're a spoiler : use these			1
what a difference two little words can make			0
we know that most of you are n't the jackasses who ran around bookstore parking lots yelling " @entity112 kills @entity113 ! " you do n't want to ruin the surprise for folks who have n't seen it			2
you just want to talk to folks who have			2
on @entity4 , throwing something like " @entity118 " or " @entity119 " at the beginning of your post gives your friends at least a fighting chance to avert their eyes			0
if you 're a spoilee : scan carefully we 've all been blindsided by spoilers , and sometimes there 's not much you can do about it			1
witness all the " @entity134 " fans who were hopping mad after accidentally learning of the sudden death of a beloved character ( two characters , actually ) in season 3			0
but if you know you 're currently missing a show that you plan to catch up on , especially if it 's a season finale or other " very special " episode , surf with one eye open			2
noticing a key word or two in a friend 's post that warns of unfamiliar terrain can give you time to turn around and read elsewhere			1
details , details if you 're a spoiler : save details for the comments section			1
we 're mainly talking about @entity4 here			0
nobody blames you for wanting to talk about the " @entity150 just happened ! " moment			0
so how about something like this ? : " scandal -- @entity150 that just happened ! ! ! ( spoilers in comments )			1
" that way , your friends who are omging along with you can head to the comments and chatter away			0
( and , yes , we 're declaring " @entity150 " a verb for now )			0
if you 're a spoilee : uh , do n't read the comments			1
if you ca n't take that hint , you 've kind of lost our sympathy here			0
take it elsewhere if you 're a spoiler : create your own space to share my pals @entity170 and @entity171 are funny			0
and they 're fans of " @entity60			0
" in what started mostly as an effort to crack each other up from across the room , they began posting snarky commentary , random observations and funny pictures to @entity4 as they watched			0
until , that is , they received the obligatory threats of physical harm from friends who had n't yet watched the latest episode			0
and , thus , was @entity170 & @entity171 's @entity185 born			0
you do n't need a massive following to create your own page , or to start your own live blog dedicated to your favorite show			1
just go ahead and build that digital treehouse , then invite a few friends you know want to play and let it rip			0
your slowpoke friends will thank you			0
as will , you know , what 's her name			0
if you 're a spoilee : stay away if you 've signed up for a blog like this , and have to miss an episode , do n't forget to stay off it until the coast is clear			0
do you have tips for how to avoid spoilers , or how to chat about your favorite shows without ruining them for others ? let us know in the comments .			1

in the digital age , it 's easier than ever to *stumble* across spoilers
dvrs , *streaming* mean we do n't all consume tv shows at the same time
consider " spoiler alert " tags or keeping details in the comments
