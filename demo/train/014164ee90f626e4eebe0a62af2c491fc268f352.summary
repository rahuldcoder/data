-- once again , we confront the specter of a school day bathed in bloodshed			1
a 16 - year - old , @entity5 , allegedly takes two long knives into a crowded corridor and sends 20 classmates and an adult to the hospital with grave injuries			1
arraigned as an adult , @entity5 looks all too familiar : thin , scared , vacant - eyed			2
he looks younger than his years as he is manacled and maneuvered into a police car			2
we have not yet filled in a motive			2
@entity5 's attorney says , " he worked well in groups , and this happened			1
so there 's a reason for it -- that 's what i 'm saying			1
and we have to get to the bottom of that			2
" and because it was knives , not guns , it was -- thankfully -- not a massacre			1
but much about the attack is familiar			1
fifteen years ago , my doctoral students and i devoted two years to studying rampage shootings in @entity33 high schools in response to the epidemic epitomized by the 1999 @entity37 shootings			2
to try to understand what motivates school attackers , we interviewed everyone who had any knowledge of two episodes -- one near @entity43 , @entity44 , and the other outside @entity45 , @entity46 -- that took place in the late ' 90s			1
@entity48 wanted to know about the circumstances that led to these outbursts in communities that have no experience of murderous violence			0
what we found at the center of the stories we followed were young men who looked a lot like @entity5			0
rampage attacks happen in safe , relatively isolated communities			1
indeed , they are most common in small rural towns where the biggest public " stage " is the local high school , the place the community gathers for events such as football games on saturdays and everybody knows your name			1
the perpetrators are often described in the media as loners , but they are not			1
they are most often " failed joiners , " people who work overtime to ingratiate themselves into cliques that reject them			1
but they do n't stop trying			0
fading into the background , close to anonymous , but rarely ever thought of as troublemakers , the protagonists look for ways to gain acceptance and attention			1
they may act like clowns ; they sometimes bully other children ; they steal -- all to seek the approval of social groups that continuously deny them recognition			1
in the instances we studied , all that effort starts to pay off the day they start talking about killing people			1
suddenly they are the objects of attention			0
they may even find their " friends " goading them			0
@entity105 , the shooter in @entity44 , resembled @entity5			0
slight and short , he was a freshman who simply could not cut it in the world of high school peers			2
he was socially awkward and a bit of prankster , but he was n't a loner			0
@entity112 tried to gain the friendship of many different social groups and finally landed in the laps of the @entity116 , boys who wore satanic garb and spoke in dark tones but who were actually among the smart ones			0
they told @entity112 that the pistol he stole from home was n't good enough , that he should come to school in a trench coat sporting a shotgun			2
@entity112 was so eager to gain their approval that he followed these instructions almost to the letter			0
three kids huddled together in a prayer group were murdered , one was paralyzed from the waist down and a fifth was hit in the arms , her athletic career ended in an instant			0
but when @entity112 shot these innocents , what was uppermost in his mind was not that he was going to kill kids but rather how this bold act would help him gain traction with the @entity116			0
they would see him as notorious and dangerous rather than a loser who was awkward and boring			0
he told the forensic psychiatrist who interviewed him after his arrest that he had found a route to popularity			0
the @entity116 would visit his house and invite him to their homes			0
he would have friends once he proved himself worthy of their respect			0
we do n't know yet if the @entity160 , @entity161 , suspect fits this profile			1
the surprise that so many of his schoolmates have expressed comes close to what teachers told us about @entity112 : that they could have named 50 others who might have committed this kind of mayhem before they got to him			0
the son of a lawyer and a homemaker , until the previous year a good student , with no obvious interest in guns , @entity112 was not on their radar screen			2
but many teenagers avoided school on the monday that @entity112 murdered his classmates because they knew something bad was coming			2
one thing we should be grateful for : the attacker in @entity161 was armed only with knives			1
had he had access to the weapons @entity112 had , we would have seen dozens die rather than suffer these wounds			0
knife attacks happen in countries such as @entity192 where guns are hard to access , and they have been lethal			1
just not as deadly as a loaded high - capacity automatic weapon that requires a split second to gun down dozens of people			0
this is small comfort in @entity160 .			1

@entity200 has studied school rampages , says stabbing attack has echoes of them
she says they tend to happen in " safe " rural towns and suspects first *mislabeled* as loners
she says attackers often are " failed joiners " who seek acceptance in actions
@entity218 : it 's small comfort for @entity161 town that attacker used knives instead of guns
