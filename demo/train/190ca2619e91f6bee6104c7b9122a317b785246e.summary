@entity0 , @entity1 -- is @entity3 planning to run for governor of @entity1 next year ? he sure sounded like it when i spoke with him this week			1
@entity3 , a one - time governor of @entity1 , is reportedly looking to run again next year			1
@entity3 was first elected governor of @entity1 in 1974			1
he was -- and still is -- the state 's youngest governor since the turn of the 20th century			2
and now ? " i think about the problems of @entity1 all the time , and , with the experience i 've had as attorney general , lawyer to most of the state agencies , mayor for eight years and governor for eight years , i 'd like to tackle the challenges that face the state , " @entity3 told me			1
" i do n't say that solving that budget thing is going to come easy , maybe not even in the first year , but i really think i can make an impact , particularly in energy , prison reform , education and water			0
" @entity3 , currently the state 's attorney general , adds : " i would work very hard to transcend the poison of partisanship which has totally changed state government for the worse since i was there			1
" in fact , polls suggest @entity3 is the frontrunner in next year 's race for @entity1 governor			1
he 's 71 years old			0
if he wins , he would also become @entity1 's oldest governor			1
@entity40 contender @entity39 alluded to that fact when his web site marked the 40th anniversary of the day @entity3 first ran for public office			2
" when it comes to @entity3 and @entity47 for @entity1 voters , it reminds us of the film ' @entity51			1
' every day is the same			0
@entity3 's always on the ballot , " @entity39 said			1
@entity1 's got huge problems , daunting even for " @entity54 , " @entity54			1
so i asked @entity3 , " why would anybody want to be governor of @entity1 ? '' " that is really a critical question			1
having been there , i have to reflect on that , '' @entity3 answered			2
" it is an impossible job , or nearly impossible , but quite frankly i love this kind of work			0
" for @entity3 , it 's the challenge -- one challenge in particular			1
" that 's one of the reasons i 'm seriously thinking about running , '' @entity3 told me			1
" i consider a it challenge worthy of all the imagination and energy i can bring to bear to try to unravel this poisonous partisan mess that state government has become			0
" during his two terms as governor , @entity3 captured the public imagination			2
he was new , young , unconventional , cutting edge			0
he was called " governor @entity3			1
'' has he changed ? well , he did get married four years ago			0
" when i was governor , i was n't married			0
i stayed at the office until 11 or 12 o'clock at night and then went and spent a little time in @entity80 , '' @entity3 said			2
" other people say that i 'm a hell of a lot better now , having married @entity84			0
all i can say is , good , i 'm glad of that			0
" can a 71 - year - old man still be cutting edge ? his thinking remains unconventional			0
" i went to a @entity91 seminary and i lived in a very authoritarian , very black - and - white world , '' @entity3 explained			2
" when i left that a long time ago , i retained a skepticism and an independence and an inquiring mind that does n't easily fit into the mold of either of the parties			0
" @entity3 may be the only politician ever brought down by an insect			2
in 1981 , his handling of a @entity101 fruit fly infestation that threatened the state 's crops caused a lot of voters to hit the roof and doomed his 1982 @entity109 campaign			0
asked about his biggest mistakes , @entity3 answers @entity111			2
" even though i used to go to confession quite regularly in my youth , i hesitate to enumerate my flaws			0
my critics have done that so eloquently that i would rather leave it there , " @entity3 told me			2
@entity3 ran for president three times			0
does he still harbor those ambitions ? " i 'd say those ambitions have dissipated with time			0
certainly , if i do run for governor , that 's enough for one lifetime , " @entity3 says today			1
when @entity3 lost his bid for the @entity109 in 1982 , he turned around and started a whole new political career , from the bottom : party chairman , radio talk show host , mayor of @entity133 , and now attorney general			1
who says there are no second acts in @entity139 lives ? after all , this is @entity1 .			0

@entity3 is currently @entity1 's attorney general
polls suggest @entity3 is the frontrunner in next year 's race for @entity1 governor
@entity3 was first elected governor of @entity1 in 1974
