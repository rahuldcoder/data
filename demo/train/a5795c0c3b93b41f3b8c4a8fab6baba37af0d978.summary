@entity1 , @entity0 -- thousands of dancers jammed a major @entity1 train station in a @entity6 - driven " flashmob " mimicking an advertisement for a phone company			1
and the event last friday evening was so successful that another is planned for next friday in @entity11 in central @entity1			1
plus , a group has been set up to organize another one at @entity14 a week later			1
videos posted on the social - networking site showed @entity14 completely filled with people , counting down the seconds until the clock showed 7 p.m. , then dancing to music on their mp3 players as the hour struck			1
the sheer scale of the event came as a complete surprise to the organizer , a 22 - year - old @entity6 user who identified himself only as @entity27			1
" i was watching tv and the @entity32 advertisement came up and i thought , hm , let 's get my friends down to @entity14 and do a little dance , " he told @entity2 by phone			1
he posted the event on @entity6 and invited his friends , who invited their friends , he said , and so on until thousands of people had been told of the plan			1
" at a quarter to seven people just flocked into the station like someone opened a plughole and the water went out , " he said			2
" they just kept coming in like sheep			0
as it grew and grew , i just thought , ' this is going to be huge			0
' " @entity50 : were you there ? send your photos and video his main memory of the event is " the volume of people -- you could n't see the floor , " he said			2
he left after 15 minutes -- the scheduled ending time -- for fear of the police , he said , adding that he had deleted his name from the event web site and refused to identify himself to @entity2 for the same reason			2
" the entire main concourse was packed full of people dancing , cheering and screaming , " said @entity2 's @entity68 , who was passing through the station on his way home			1
" there were camera flashes going off constantly			0
there were also loads of people crammed around the edge of the upper level of the station , looking down at the scene below			2
" there were a lot of bemused commuters wandering around the edges , trying to get to their trains but nobody seemed to mind too much			0
everyone seemed pretty good humored , " he said			0
" i think a lot of people who pass through @entity14 regularly are getting used to this sort of thing			1
" @entity98 also described it as " mainly a good humored event , " adding " no arrests were made and no crimes were reported			2
" police did not have an immediate estimate of the crowd size , but more than 14,000 people joined the @entity6 group " @entity107			1
" " it was both good cause we all stuck like a group did n't stop dancing inside and outside but bad cause of the people who could get anywhere but hey i love it we @entity117 ! ! " one @entity6 user said on the event 's web site			1
" yeah i agree , there was n't any bad feelings there			0
everybody just had a good time , apart from my friend being groped by some guy , but you 'll always get one , " another wrote			0
the @entity32 commercial which inspired the event shows several hundred people dancing in the station			2
the dancing in the advertisement appears to be spontaneous but was actually choreographed			0
it was filmed january 15 and has been widely broadcast since then			0
the success of the event has prompted @entity135 to call for another silent dance at @entity11 in central @entity1 on february 13			1
a group has been set up to organize another one at @entity14 a week later			2
the station has a large open space with a balcony surrounding it			0
user videos shot from the balcony and posted on @entity6 showed every available inch of space filled with people , many of them cheering , though the event was billed as " silent			1
" @entity150 -- groups of people meeting and all doing the same thing together in public , from dancing to freezing in place -- have become increasingly regular events around the world			0
ireport.com : see an organized mass pillowfight in @entity160 @entity1 's @entity161 was the scene of a flashmob dance in 2007 , and hundreds of people froze in place in @entity11 , then formed a conga line in 2008			1
@entity167 , a comedian and founder of the @entity170 group @entity167 , which organizes flashmobs , says the point of the group 's " missions " is simple			0
" we get satisfaction from coming up with an awesome idea and making it come to life , " he writes on the group 's web site			0
" in the process we bring excitement to otherwise unexciting locales and give strangers a story they can tell for the rest of their lives			0
we 're out to prove that a prank does n't have to involve humiliation or embarrassment ; it can simply be about making someone laugh , smile , or stop to notice the world around them			0
