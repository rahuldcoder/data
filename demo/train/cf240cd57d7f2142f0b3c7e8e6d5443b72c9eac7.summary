do n't pre-judge ! do n't assume the worst of people ! what 's not to like ? " " oh @entity26 , so much , " @entity16 wrote			2
" the sappy ballad arrangement that sets up the confounding metaphors ( ' the red flag on my chest is somehow like the elephant / in the corner of the @entity34 / and i just walked him right in the room ' ) and clunky lyrics ( ' i was n't there when @entity38 turned the south into firewood / i want you to get paid , but be a slave i never could ' )			0
" " the basic misrepresentations of history , such as describing reconstruction as mainly being when ' they ... fixed the buildings , dried some tears			0
' the seriously questionable assumptions about the @entity51 employee dress code : ( ' just because my pants are saggin ' does n't mean i 'm up to no good ' / ' do n't judge my do - rag ' )			0
" a @entity0 commentator named @entity56 said of was " awful			0

" country music star @entity69 dealt with charges that he was " ruining country music " when he paired up with rapper @entity72 last year for the single " @entity73			1
" at the time , a blogger from @entity75 discussed the tune in a piece titled " the destruction of @entity80 's @entity79			0
" " negative connotations in media about redneck culture are making many people in rural areas flee from their native habits to adopt customs more indigenous to urban locales , giving rise to country rap with artists like @entity93 , " the writer stated			1
" @entity69 's country rap ' @entity73 ' was the best - selling song in country music last year for example			1
at the same time , the power of pop country is causing similar gentrification in suburban and urban zones as it encroaches into areas it is not indigenous to either			1
" @entity5 's proud of ' @entity2 ' @entity69 took to @entity102 to defend his choice of musical partners after the public railed against him			1
" they were bashing the fact that i had him out there and said that i was ruining country music and all this kind of stuff , " the singer told reporters at the time			1

' i just decided to fire back , which i never do			0

" it ai n't nothin ' country about this song , " @entity122 told @entity132			2
" but it was fun to get in there and sing with him , " he said , adding , " people are really liking the song			0
" more recently , @entity124 joined country duo @entity140 for a remix of their song " @entity145			2
" @entity146 and @entity147 seemed like more of a natural fit -- if for no other reason than their both high publicized love of a certain plant			0
@entity147 sings " too many pain pills , too much pot / @entity154 to be somethin that i 'm not - @entity157 ! superman / @entity154 to do more than i can , i got a little outta hand / i ai n't @entity157 - know what i 'm talkin ' ' bout ? " the rapper follows that up with a little bit of singing himself			2
one of the most famous songs never released came courtesy of the queen of the crossover , pop / country star @entity169			1
