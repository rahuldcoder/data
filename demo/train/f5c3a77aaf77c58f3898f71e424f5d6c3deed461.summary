-- widely considered @entity3 's cultural capital , @entity1 is one of the country 's top travel destinations among domestic and , increasingly , international tourists			1
drawing 50 million visitors a year , it 's the place to learn to whip up a cup of matcha green tea , admire the craftsmanship of a geisha 's kimono and study the art of the zen garden in an ancient temple before sitting down for a $ 500 kaiseki ( @entity21 haute cuisine ) dinner			0
readers of " @entity24 " magazine even voted it world 's best city this year , citing its " emerging style scene that 's cutting edge			0
" yet despite @entity1 's obvious allure , until earlier this year there was one glaring absence from the city 's travel scene -- a top tier , super-luxury hotel brand			1
@entity36 ended that drought in february with the opening of its fourth @entity3 property , located close to popular downtown areas like @entity41 and @entity42 , the city 's retail and entertainment district			1
" it is actually quite odd that there have not been international ultra-luxe hotel brands in @entity1 until recently , considering the fact that @entity1 is an extremely popular tourist destination , " says @entity47 , ceo of luxury travel planner @entity48			1
" @entity1 's @entity55 is very nice and it has sufficed , but it is not a @entity55 which is more in line with @entity36 and @entity58			1
the most sumptuous accommodations to date have actually been @entity60 [ by @entity21 brand @entity60 ] , which is what i call a @entity21 hybrid ryokan ( a cross between a ryokan and a hotel ) , very little known outside @entity3			2
" the decision to open in @entity1 was a matter of catering to demand , says @entity36 , @entity1 general manager @entity68			1
" the @entity36 is constantly listening to its loyal guests and a constant theme for us is to build hotels where our guests want us to be and @entity1 was high on the list , " he says			1
" bringing the brand to @entity1 is a major milestone -- a global iconic city , a window to @entity3 while being sensitive to centuries of tradition			1
we were fortunate to be able to work with like - minded partners in a rare location			0
" billing itself a modern international luxury ryokan , the property has 134 rooms and suites and faces the @entity88 and the @entity89 in the distance			0
what 's inside it 's difficult not to dismiss the " luxury ryokan " term as marketing fluff			0
a ryoken is , after all , a basic @entity21 inn and the @entity36 brand hardly conjures images of elderly kimono - clad women bringing you a pot of green tea once you awake from a night on a futon			2
but during a recent visit we found there 's some merit to the claim , given the intense attention to detail and subtle touches , like tatami suites , where guests can enjoy a classic futon experience -- albeit while covered in 600 - thread - count linens			0
the architects and designers infused the character of a traditional @entity122 house and courtyard into the architectural structure of the building , while blending in modern design elements			0
this includes the use of patterned motifs created by local artists and the incorporation of zen gardens ( karesansui ) and water features , such as a stunning three - story waterfall positioned in the heart of the hotel that stretches down to the basement swimming pool			0
" each @entity36 is designed with a strong sense of place , " says @entity68			0
" this property carries the heart and soul of @entity36 service while staying true to the community in which it is located			0
the @entity36 , @entity1 was designed very much as a peaceful sanctuary and with the principles of miyabi -- or @entity21 aesthetic concepts -- in mind			2
" the hotel 's @entity153 @entity21 restaurant is already gaining a reputation among locals for its incredible kaiseki expertise -- the world 's most beautiful multi-course feast -- and also serves sushi , teppanyaki and tempura			2
even the @entity164 restaurant pays respect to @entity3 's history			1
inside the beautifully decorated venue they 've reassembled a townhouse once owned by @entity1 magnate @entity170 and turned it into a private dining room			0
more luxury on the way though big brands are notably absent , luxury seekers in @entity1 have hardly been neglected through the years			2
there are a handful of top - end ryokans , but they fill quickly during popular travel times -- particularly cherry blossom season in spring and the changing of the leaves in fall			2
@entity185 , for instance , has been described as the top ryokan in not just @entity1 , but all of @entity3			1
" most of our clients do two - week trips to @entity3 including three nights each in @entity192 and @entity1 , plus three or four other destinations , " says @entity187 's @entity47			1
" they typically want a mix of hotels and ryokans -- and i strongly urge all clients to do at least one ryokan			0
" traditional ryokans include elaborate 12 - plus - course kaiseki dinners every night , which are absolutely heavenly in my opinion , but they can be over the top for many @entity204 travelers to have every single night , so it is nice to have variety and a mix of cuisines			0
" the arrival of a branded super-luxury hotel is welcome news for high - end travelers who want the full amenities and service that come with a global brand -- or ca n't live without their bacon and egg breakfast -- yet also want to experience the finer details of @entity21 culture			2
the @entity36 @entity1 is n't alone in recognizing this			1
competition is on the way , with the @entity58 due to arrive in 2016			2
" i think travel to @entity1 will inevitably increase with two new five - star world - class brands , " says @entity47			1
" in the past it has been very difficult to get rooms in springtime during cherry blossom season , so that situation should change a lot with hundreds of new rooms available			0
" @entity36 , @entity1 , @entity232 , @entity233 - ku , @entity1 , @entity3 ; +81 75 746 5555 ; rooms from 53,000 yen ( $ 510 ) @entity0 's series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile			1
however @entity0 retains full editorial control over all of its reports			0

@entity1 is one of @entity3 's top travel destinations , yet branded hotels are few
@entity36 , @entity1 is the luxury brand 's fourth @entity3 hotel
@entity58 @entity1 due to open in 2016
" travel will inevitably increase with two new five - star world - class brands , " says luxury travel ceo
