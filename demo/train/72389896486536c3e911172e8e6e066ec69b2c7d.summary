@entity0 -- the beautifully ornate @entity2 in the nation 's capital has seen its share of history and controversy			1
cardinal @entity8 and chief justice @entity9 attend @entity10 in 2005			1
in 1963 , the @entity11 was the site of @entity13 's funeral			2
after the service , on the steps outside , the slain president 's young son famously saluted his father 's memory			2
but the church is also the site of an annual mass that has drawn criticism for what many see as an unhealthy mix of politics , the law and religion			1
@entity0 's annual @entity10 , which celebrates the legal profession , will be held this year on sunday , october 4 -- the day before the @entity30 begins its new term			1
several justices traditionally attend , along with congressional leaders , diplomats , cabinet secretaries and other dignitaries			1
past presidents have also attended , though there is no word yet on whether president @entity40 will appear			2
it is a @entity2 service , but power brokers of other faiths are asked to attend the invitation - only event			1
justice @entity45 , who is @entity46 , is a regular			2
the mass " takes its name from the color of the vestments			2
... [ it ] goes back centuries , to @entity55 , to @entity56 to @entity57 , " @entity0 archbishop @entity52 said			1
" there was the idea [ to ] bring all the people who are involved in the law ... once a year so that together , they can simply pray for the wisdom of @entity63			1
" the church , built starting in the 19th century , is considered one of @entity0 's hidden gems			1
tucked between modern office buildings a few blocks from the @entity70 , it is a mix of architectural styles , a hint of ancient @entity74 style , a splash from the @entity76 and a definite @entity78 flavor			2
@entity79 , noted monsignor @entity80 , was the patron saint of civil servants , appropriate in a city where the federal government dominates the workforce			0
five justices attended last year 's @entity10 , which was similar in tone to other recent gatherings			2
cardinal @entity89 , who has held several prominent positions in the @entity2 , noted many parts of the @entity92 " sound very much like @entity94 ideals " and reminded the members of the high court to build a society " of justice , of peace and of love			0
" critics of the service , however , find the attendance of leading decision - makers , including members of the highest court in the land , to be inappropriate			0
" the truth is , this was set up as a way to basically lecture and give information to the justices , " said the rev. @entity108 , president of @entity109			1
" there is no other institution that has this special way to talk to the justices on the @entity30			1
" the @entity10 was started in @entity0 in 1952 by the @entity118 , a lay @entity2 group of prominent lawyers and professionals			1
chief justice @entity9 ' wife , @entity121 , is an officer of the group			0
@entity108 , an ordained minister with the @entity123 , noted the @entity124 was begun after several high court decisions that were disapproved of by the archdiocese			1
" they figured if they got all the justices together and chatted them up in a worship service , they might be able to convince them to see the law their way , " he said			1
in 1989 , a top church official used the occasion of the @entity124 to call for a return to " religiously based moral values " and lament the " inviolable , impenetrable and towering wall " between church and state			1
in 1986 , @entity0 cardinal @entity143 attacked the @entity30 's @entity145 ruling legalizing abortion			1
among those in attendance that year were then - chief justice @entity149 and justices @entity150 and @entity152 , both @entity2			2
one member of the court who no longer attends is @entity156 who , like @entity45 , is @entity46			0
@entity157 said she grew tired of being lectured to by @entity2 officials			0
" i went one year , and i will never go again , because this sermon was outrageously anti-abortion , " @entity156 said in the book " @entity160 : prominent @entity46 talk about being @entity46 " by author @entity162			0
" even the @entity163 , although they 're much of that persuasion , were embarrassed for me			0
" six @entity2 now sit on the high court : @entity9 , @entity150 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169			0
church officials , however , said they do not attempt to lobby or seek to persuade anyone who attends the service			0
@entity52 likens the experience to putting aside the partisanship and troubles in the world and seeking comfort in a shared community and a sacred place			0
@entity94 have " been very careful about ... not allowing any one tradition or church to become the state church , " he said			0
" but from the very beginning , we 've always said we need to hear the voice of faith in all the discussion that is a part of determining what we want to do			0
" @entity108 takes a different tack			0
" i do n't think there is any doubt that people in that congregation , including the @entity30 justices , are going to listen to what is said			1
they might hear something phrased in a way you might never hear it in the court , but it might become a lingering factor in their decisions			0
... people who are concerned about the @entity10 worry about this kind of undue influence , an influence that no other group , religious or otherwise , has on those nine men and women			0
" their sharply differing perspectives show that , more than two centuries after the @entity217 's ratification , the interpretation of the @entity212 and the role of religion in @entity94 society remain hotly contested questions			0
@entity1 's @entity220 contributed to this report .			0

@entity223 in @entity0 celebrates the legal profession
it began in 1952 ; several @entity30 justices regularly attend
it is *touted* as a chance for those involved in law to pray for wisdom
critic says @entity124 set up to " lecture and give information to the justices "
