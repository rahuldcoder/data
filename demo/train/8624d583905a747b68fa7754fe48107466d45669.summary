-- @entity1 is an angry guy -- or at least he plays one on the @entity2			1
the @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 contributor and sci - fi author has amassed a large , rabid fan base for his sharp , smart , acidic rants on subjects ranging from the coaching abilities of @entity12 and the uselessness of scab referees to his hatred of scarves and the punchability of @entity19 's face			1
but all that ire and energy were of little use as @entity1 and his wife watched their prematurely born child cling to life in a neonatal intensive care unit as a result of a condition known as intestinal malrotation			1
luckily , the youngest @entity1 survived , and the ordeal inspired the father of three to share his parenting experiences in a new memoir , " someone could get @entity37			1
" @entity0 spoke with @entity1 about the peaks and pitfalls of being a dad in an often dangerous world			1
an edited transcript is below : @entity0 : there are a lot of dad stereotypes out there , from doofus to " @entity48			2
" do they have any impact on you ? @entity1 : they suck			1
@entity53 is clueless , bumbling and useless , or he 's a hippie who 's trying to breast - feed his kid			1
that can dictate behavior that you think you 're expected to live up to			2
@entity0 : fear is a prevalent theme in the book			2
what 's the difference in the fear you felt before and after you had your kids ? @entity70 : every guy thinks , " the kid is here , life 's not going to be fun anymore			1
" there 's a dread of not having the world revolve around you			1
i 'm over that , and i 'm more than happy to be a lameass who goes to bed by 9 every night			2
once you have kids , you have all kinds of other fears : the kid getting hurt , or worse			2
you fear that everyone is watching you fail -- that there will not be another human being at the playground who is a worse parent than you are			2
it 's all very self - inflicted and self - involved			1
i get too concerned with looking like i 'm doing a good job rather than parenting well			2
you have to get past that layer of self - analysis , and that 's very hard in this day and age			1
@entity0 : how do you think the @entity2 has affected how people parent ? @entity70 : your mistakes , admissions and fears are much more public			2
in that way , it 's very good because there 's more information for you to draw on and parents to commiserate with			1
it 's really important for parents to have an outlet			1
every time i 've gotten advice on parenting , it might not have worked , but at least i felt more secure , not completely helpless			2
the downside is that people are d * * * *			2
on certain mom forums , people are very supportive -- you present a problem and people will rush in with answers			2
but then there 's a news story about a mom giving her kid a vegan diet , and it 's 300 comments about " you 're a horrible person			1
" it 's all amplified : the judgment and the support are more out in the open			1
@entity0 : what did your own dad teach you about fatherhood ? @entity70 : he 's a good dad , but he 's a different kind of dad			1
i always expect things to work out for me the same way they worked out for him			2
when i 'm not as effective as he was , i get really pissed off and frustrated , and i feel like i 'm failing him			2
@entity0 : are you having parenting discussions with your friends who are fathers ? @entity70 : no. when moms get together , they 'll talk shop a lot			0
guys just would rather talk about anything else -- sports or something			0
there really is n't as much help or sounding boards for dads			0
there 's no one who is like , " hey , come here , i 'll help out			1
" guys wo n't sit down and open a handbook ; you get it all from the mom			0
she 'll read something or make you read it ( and you read half of it )			0
the other useful person is the pediatrician			0
still , you can ask if your kid is barfing too much , but you ca n't really ask , " how do i get my kid to listen ? " modern fathers face new expectations @entity0 : in the book , you shared a story of getting so frustrated with your daughter , you worried about what you might do			0
what did you take away from that ? @entity70 : i reacted poorly			0
you feel so awful for being angry at your kid , and you can see the precipice that you 're on			0
down one avenue there 's a nice relationship where you 're mutually respectful of each other , and down the other is abuse or just antagonism all day long			1
it 's terrifying to see that and visualize a future where the fighting never ends			1
i 'm getting better at it			0
@entity0 : is it hard to let your kids have free rein to screw up ? @entity70 : i was allowed to go outside unsupervised when i was 8 or 9 and explore the way you 're supposed ( to )			0
it 's good parenting to let kids figure out things on their own			1
but it 's more difficult now because the world is more dangerous			1
the @entity2 has lots of terrible s * * * on it			0
my neighborhood does n't have sidewalks , so it 's not amenable to walking			1
there 's @entity223 in the backyard			1
it 's not the safe meadow it used to be , so that makes it a little bit of push and pull			1
@entity0 : you 're known in your writing for having very strong opinions about how things should be			0
do you set that perfectionism aside at home ? @entity70 : i do a pretty good job in real life about not having huge expectations of my kids going to x school , having x job or making x amount of money			0
that 's very old - fashioned , and it 's going away			1
the things kids say and do are unlike anything you 'd think of , and that 's the fun of being a parent			1
when it 's not fun is when they 're acting in a way that presents a problem you do n't know how to solve			1
they 're screaming their heads off for three hours , and you have this fear that they 'll keep screaming forever			0
you 're trying to get your kid to the bus stop , and really , they do n't have to go if they do n't want to			0
what are you gon na do about it ? that 's a terrifying thing to realize -- that only they have the control over what they 're going to do , and you just have to try to guide them in the right direction			1
that 's the difference between being a good parent and a helicopter parent			1
@entity0 : how do you pick yourself back up from a bad parenting day ? @entity70 : i have a glass of wine and go to bed			0
when my wife and i know the day is going badly , we 'll just cut our losses , go to bed at 8 and wake up with a fresh slate			0
you do n't usually get two bad days in a row			0
of course , all the parents of teenagers tell me it gets worse			0
they all look shellshocked ; it 's terrible			1
@entity0 : when you were a teenager , did you think that manhood included being a dad ? @entity70 : no , i was like any other guy , " i 'll get married when i 'm 50 and i 'm gon na make movies and snort cocaine			0
... " all guys are like that , and then they undoucheify			0
a lot of what we do at @entity4 is debunking the bro thing			1
men should get more credit than that			0
when guys write to me , they have fears and hopes and imaginations			0
they 're a lot more interesting psychologically than just being douche bags who want to go clubbing			0
@entity0 : did you have a moment when you saw that transformation in yourself ? @entity70 : probably when my third kid almost died			0
i was more grateful for existence -- i was n't quite the cynical ass i 'd always been , and that 's permanently the case now			1
@entity0 : what did facing that teach you about the kind of man and father you want to be ? @entity70 : you can have kids and not fundamentally change -- you just get to do more stuff			2
people say they change your life , but you 're still pretty much the same person , but walking around grumpy because you do n't get any sleep			0
i 'll still get frustrated with my kid when he 's crying his ass off , but i 'm happy he 's here			2
i have a fundamental understanding of how ridiculous it is to be annoyed at him -- because i 'm happy he 's not dead			2
i tell my kids i love them every day			0
i hug them and kiss them and all that , probably more than they want			0
i 'm not the stoic dad , where you 're fighting for 50 years to hear your dad say , " i love you " once			0
@entity0 : what advice would you give to a first - time dad ? @entity70 : know when to walk away			0
not from parenting , of course , but from meltdowns and conflicts			0
it 's not worth it			2
