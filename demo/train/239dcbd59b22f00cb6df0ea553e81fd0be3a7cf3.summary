three people in @entity2 may have died after smoking synthetic marijuana , state health officials fear			1
the @entity2 @entity4 has launched an investigation into an outbreak of illnesses at hospitals that may be tied to the dangerous substance			2
" initial reports show approximately 75 people who reported smoking a form of synthetic marijuana may have been seen at hospitals in the @entity19 metro area and @entity20 beginning in late august , " said dr. @entity10 , interim chief medical officer for the state , in a written statement			1
" several individuals were in intensive care and three deaths are being investigated as possibly associated			0
" the @entity2 @entity24 , with help from local health officials and the @entity27 , will attempt to figure out if the synthetic marijuana is to blame , and if so , whether all the patients were sickened by the same product or different ones			1
but " do n't wait for the results of this investigation , " @entity10 urged			0
" if you have synthetic marijuana , stop using it and destroy it			1
" teen narrowly escapes death after smoking synthetic marijuana known as @entity42 , @entity42 , @entity43 , mr. @entity44 and @entity45 , among other things , synthetic marijuana can have more serious consequences than regular marijuana , which is legal in @entity2			1
these synthetic cannabinoids are a blend of plant and herbal materials that have been sprayed with chemicals , producing an extra toxicity , according to the @entity55			1

but doctors say there are additional side effects that may be particularly dangerous			0
the drug can leave patients catatonic and listless			0
and what makes matters worse , very little is known about synthetic marijuana or how to treat an adverse reaction or overdose			2
according to the @entity74 , the number of calls to poison centers related to synthetic drugs soared from about 3,200 in 2010 to more than 13,000 in 2011			2
" easy access and the misperception that @entity42 products are ' natural ' and therefore harmless have likely contributed to their popularity , " the @entity55 website states			0
" another selling point is that the chemicals used in @entity42 are not easily detected in standard drug tests			0
" because the chemicals used in these products have a high potential for abuse and no medical benefit , the @entity74 has designated five of the most common active chemicals frequently found in synthetic marijuana as schedule i controlled substances , making it illegal to sell , buy , or possess them			1
but manufacturers seem to be changing the chemical compounds as fast as lawmakers enact legislation to ban them			0
the @entity27 was sending a team of four to assist the investigation .			0
