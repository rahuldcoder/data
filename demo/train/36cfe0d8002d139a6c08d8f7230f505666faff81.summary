@entity0 -- @entity3 president @entity2 arrived in the @entity4 on tuesday for a state visit that will include high - profile talks with president @entity7 on trade , currency , @entity10 and other issues			1
the three - day trip includes a state dinner on wednesday and the eighth face - to - face meeting between @entity7 and the @entity3 leader , which administration officials say illustrates the importance of relations between two global powers at a time described by @entity4 secretary of state @entity21 as a " critical juncture			1
" @entity3 state media has reported that @entity2 will stress how a constructive , comprehensive partnership between the two nations could be mutually beneficial and help ensure stability in @entity27 and worldwide , despite differences between @entity29 and @entity0 on issues such as human rights and currency controls			1
in addition to @entity7 , @entity2 is also scheduled to meet with top legislators and business executives			1
after @entity0 , @entity2 will make a stop in @entity37 on thursday			0
vice president @entity38 greeted @entity2 when the @entity3 leader arrived at @entity40 in @entity41 on tuesday afternoon			1
a military honor guard saluted @entity2 and a military band played the national anthems of both countries as @entity2 and @entity38 stood on a red carpet on the air base tarmac			2
@entity2 later arrived at the @entity48 for what officials called a small dinner gathering with @entity7 , @entity52 and national security adviser @entity53			1
" this provides a bit of an informal setting in which to have some of these discussions , " @entity48 press secretary @entity54 said earlier tuesday about the dinner			2
on wednesday , the two leaders will hold bilateral talks followed by a joint news conference , and @entity2 will be the guest of honor at a formal state dinner in the evening			1
before @entity2 's arrival , @entity4 legislators and demonstrators criticized @entity3 's human rights record , including political repression , and called for @entity7 to press the issue in his talks with the @entity3 leader			1
" it is more important to honor and remember those who can not attend this @entity77 rather than those who will be in attendance , " said a statement by the rev. @entity73 , director of the @entity74			0
" while the guests are dining on expensive and extravagant food there will be scores who will be oppressed and placed behind bars by the @entity3 government because of their faith and political beliefs ; people like @entity91 laureate @entity90 who is in prison , " and others			0
@entity54 said that @entity7 would raise human rights concerns with @entity2			1
" obviously that is a topic of some significance that the two leaders will talk about , " @entity54 told reporters			0
" we will continue to have difficult conversations " with @entity3 on the subject			0
this week 's meeting between the leaders of the world 's two largest economies also put the spotlight on criticism that the government - controlled @entity106 artificially undervalues the yuan , bringing down the cost of @entity3 exports , which would give it an advantage in the international market			2
last week , treasury secretary @entity113 said @entity3 must do more to address its undervalued currency and dependence on exports , adding that such a move is in @entity29 's best interest because it will control inflation			2
@entity119 this week renewed their push to crack down on countries that manipulate their currencies , with @entity3 clearly in their crosshairs			0
a bill introduced monday by @entity127 sen. @entity126 and two other @entity119 would impose penalties , including possible tariffs , on nations that manipulate their currencies			0
the senators told reporters in a conference call that @entity3 's currency and trade polices undercut @entity4 manufacturers and are costing @entity4 jobs			1
" @entity3 's currency is like a boot on the throat of @entity4 's economic recovery , " @entity126 said			1
but @entity2 dismissed the argument that price stability is a reason for yuan appreciation , telling the @entity147 and the @entity148 that @entity3 inflation is " moderate and controllable			2
" in an apparent attempt to smooth relations ahead of this week 's meeting with @entity7 , the @entity106 last week began providing the yuan directly to @entity4 traders for the first time			2
the @entity3 president has complaints of his own , particularly with @entity160 policy aimed at stimulating the economy			2
the policies especially affect @entity3 , given that it holds billions of dollars in government debt			0
the @entity160 policy makes @entity4 bonds a less attractive investment for the @entity3			0
in a speech friday at the @entity167 , @entity52 said @entity3 must assume the responsibility of being a world power , rather than basing policies on its own self - interest			0
@entity52 acknowledged that relations between @entity29 and @entity0 were at a " critical juncture , " noting persisting tensions on economic and security issues and accusing @entity3 of discriminatory practices that put @entity4 firms at a disadvantage			0
still , insisting that the @entity4 does n't view @entity3 as a threat , she said , " our economies are intertwined and so are our futures			0
" one hot - button issue that @entity29 addressed on sunday was the @entity185 , days after @entity52 urged @entity3 to use its " unique ties " with @entity10 to tamp down tensions there			1
urging an early resumption of long - stalled six - party talks committed to reining in @entity10 's nuclear program , assistant foreign minister @entity187 told @entity191 that " the peninsula 's denuclearization and the normalization of relations " was in all parties ' interest			1
" @entity3 will continue to work with all the parties concerned and the international community to ensure peace , stability and prosperity , " he said			0
@entity1 's @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205 contributed to this report .			0
