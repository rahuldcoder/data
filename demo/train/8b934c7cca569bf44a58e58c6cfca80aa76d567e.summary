-- if you 've ever been at a crowded bar or a packed party , you have probably waited a long time for a drink			1
one answer to that problem : a new bartender with the generic @entity10 name of @entity11			1
he 's short and squat and not much of a conversationalist , but he 'll whip up a screwdriver for you in a flash			0
the @entity11 is a boxy tabletop device that works like a vending machine for cocktails			1
punch in your order on a colorful touchscreen or order from your phone , and the machine will blend liquor with mixers and pour them into your cup			1
when fully equipped , @entity11 can make up to 300 types of drinks			1
" it 's very intuitive , simple to use and easily programmable to your drink preferences , " said @entity29 , who tried the machine at a recent launch event in @entity31			2
@entity29 requested a seasonal recommendation and received a vodka and orange juice , which she said was " very good			0
" the device is the brainchild of @entity39 , co-founder and ceo of @entity11 , the startup behind the machine			1
@entity39 came up with the idea for a " robotic bartender , " as he calls it , while struggling to get a drink at a crowded bar one spring during the @entity47			1
he and fellow @entity49 alum @entity48 , @entity11 's chief technology officer , designed the machine after a fundraising campaign on @entity51			1
the @entity11 measures 20 inches high and 21 inches wide and bears a color @entity53 touchscreen allowing customers to browse and order drinks from up to eight mixers and liquors			1
the touchscreen controls coolers , pumps , sensors and other mechanical components to blend ingredients and deliver your drink			2
beneath the touchscreen is an opening where you place your cup			2
a sensor prevents the drink from pouring until the cup is in place			0
each @entity11 comes with 12 themes , such as " bachelorette party , " " @entity76 " or " cigar bar , " and each theme offers 20 to 25 drink selections			1
the machine offers only liquor - based drinks , but its creators are open to adding beer , wine and @entity85			2
consumers can also create themes and drinks and share them with others via social media			2
@entity39 hopes @entity11 will become the @entity91 of cocktails , allowing people from around the world to exchange themes and cocktails the way they share songs or albums online			1
@entity48 says one special feature of @entity11 is its artificial intelligence : the machine can recommend drinks based on what you have ordered in the past , the season or time of day			1
it also can be programmed from your smartphone to , say , serve you a drink when you arrive home from work			0
another feature @entity39 is proud of is the " responsibility " section of the @entity115 mobile app. you can enter your gender and weight , and the app will keep track of how much liquor you have consumed and estimate your blood - alcohol level			0
once you have reached a certain level -- in most @entity126 states , drivers are legally drunk with a blood - alcohol level of .08 -- @entity11 can send a notification to your phone			1
if you are driving , @entity11 will prompt you to the @entity131 app to find you a driver or a taxi			2
@entity39 also says the app can " cut drinkers off " by monitoring their profile and determining when they 've had too much			0
" we want to revolutionize this whole experience			0
... we are using all this technology			0
there is no way we ca n't try to help people drink more responsibly , " he said			0
@entity39 and @entity48 hope to see @entity11 installed in bars and suites at sports venues			2
they say they do n't want to replace bartenders but to augment their services			0
to eliminate underage drinking , @entity48 suggests that bars hand out radio frequency identification wristbands when they check customers ' ids			2
the wristbands will have @entity159 chips inside them confirming that the wearer is over 21			0
before a customer can buy a drink from a @entity166 machine , they 'll have to scan their @entity159 wristband			0
the @entity169 team hopes to implement this technology into the machine by april			0
the @entity11 currently has no system to accept payments , but @entity39 and @entity48 would like to add a feature that would let patrons pay for drinks online or by swiping a card on the machine			1
monsieur is not the only robotic bartender hitting the market			1
a @entity181 company claims that its @entity182 , a liquid - dispensing system of pumps and exposed tubes , can create a cocktail in 10 seconds			0
the @entity188 app allows partygoers to control a three - armed robot bartender using their cellphones			0
at the @entity31 event , @entity29 and fellow drinker @entity192 said they could see themselves using the @entity11 for parties , events and football games			2
" you do n't need to pay for a bartender ; you just need ice			0
people can serve themselves at parties now , " @entity192 said			0
if you want a monsieur of your own to make you drinks , it will cost you			0
the retail price is $ 5,000 , which does n't include shipping costs			1
commercial customers will pay a one - time setup fee of $ 1,000 plus $ 299 per month for a subscription that includes tech support and access to a web app allowing them to monitor the status of their @entity11 in real time			1
@entity39 envisions the future of @entity11 much like @entity219			2
he wants his robotic bartender to become synonymous with social drinking , the way @entity219 is to coffee			1
in the future " wherever you are , there will be a @entity227 system close by , and you will go through a seamless process to get a cocktail , " he said .			0

@entity11 , a " robotic bartender " machine , can make up to 300 kinds of cocktails
customers order on a touchscreen or through their phones
each @entity11 comes with 12 themes , such as " bachelorette party , " " @entity76 " or " cigar bar "
if you want a @entity11 for *personal* use , the retail price is $ 5,000
