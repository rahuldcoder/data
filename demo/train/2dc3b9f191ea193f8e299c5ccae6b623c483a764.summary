-- a report issued monday by @entity3 attorney general 's says that more could have been done to put convicted pedophile @entity4 behind bars earlier , but the investigation stalled for months at a time in the three years that a case was built against the former @entity9 football defensive coordinator			1
the report does not accuse anyone -- most notably the former attorney general , current @entity3 gov. @entity11 -- of doing anything maliciously to delay the investigation			1
instead , it says that investigators from different agencies failed to communicate and share information and that search warrants and subpoenas were not issued as quickly as they could have been			1
for example , almost three years before his arrest , @entity4 was interviewed by a social worker , but police were not invited to the interview			2
" this was a notable failure , particularly since at no point later in the investigation did law enforcement manage to interview @entity4 , " the report said			2
the report also faults investigators for not finding a 1998 police report at @entity9 for nearly two years despite the fact that several people in law enforcement were aware of it			0
@entity37 also waited two years before contacting @entity4 's children 's charity , the @entity38 , the place where he met almost all of his victims			0
@entity4 was convicted in 2012 of 45 counts of child sex abuse against 10 boys			1
his arrest came with charges including conspiracy and perjury against three @entity9 officials , including the former university president			0
and the scandal led to the firing of legendary @entity9 coach @entity53			0
the report does not talk about @entity53 's role in the scandal â € ” a widely debated topic among @entity9 loyalists and fans who are trying to restore his reputation			0
attorney general @entity62 promised a review of her predecessor 's handling of the case when she took office in 2012 , and monday 's report is the conclusion of that two - year review			1
@entity11 declined to respond to the report			0
investigators from the @entity37 , along with various child welfare agencies , disputed that the actions of their staffs contributed in any way to the delay in the investigation , but instead said that the initial case was too weak to stand alone in criminal court , especially given @entity4 's stellar reputation in the community			1
former @entity9 athletic director @entity83 , former vice president @entity84 and former president @entity85 are all awaiting trial on charges related to an alleged cover - up of @entity4 's crimes from the late 1990s and early 2000s			0
prosecutors say that e-mails show the @entity93 officials knew about two reports of @entity4 abusing boys in the locker room showers on campus , but did not report the second one to police			2
that second incident was witnessed by former assistant coach @entity100 , and the case could go to court later this year , although it has continuously been delayed since the 2011 arrests			0
