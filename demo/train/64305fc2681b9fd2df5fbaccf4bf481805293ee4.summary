-- when a band spends as much time as the @entity4 has gaining momentum on the indie scene only to suddenly take off , there is always concern of selling out			1
yet the group has defied expectations by topping the mainstream charts while still holding on to its independent cred			2
the @entity4 self - released their first album in 2001 , and with 11 years and five albums now under their belt , they show no signs of slowing down			1

" the collaborations that we do are with artists that we feel fit on the song or can add something special to that particular song , " he said			0
" it 's never , ever been for namesake			0
the fact that we can even ... [ that ] we have the chance to reach out to artists that we look up to is amazing			0
" @entity58 believes his band has fought hard to get this far , and they 've learned never let anything get in their way of putting on a good show			2
" i think coming up the way we did , playing shows in front of crowds that were n't necessarily there to see us ... we made sure that the 35 to 40 minutes that we had of their time , that they had a good time , " he said			2
the @entity4 broke through to the mainstream with the catchy 2007 hit " @entity96 " from their third album , " @entity95			1
" @entity58 revealed how their latest became that record 's sequel			1
" i feel like the new record chronicles from the time we put that album out until now , like having hit records , working with artists that we look up to , touring the world , becoming fathers , getting married			0
" @entity58 is aware of criticism the band may receive from fans they 've had since their debut , but he does n't let that stand in the way of moving onward and upward			1
" we dealt with a lot of negativity and negative feedback from fans because we did shows with anyone who would let us be with them			0
we took it all in stride and stayed doing what we do ... i ca n't see myself giving this up anytime soon			1
