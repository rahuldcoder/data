-- @entity2 's chase for what is widely suspected to be a submerged @entity5 submarine operating within its territorial waters ca n't help but remind older @entity2 of the fact that , during the @entity10 , @entity2 waters were thought to be regularly covertly probed by submarines belonging to the @entity12			1
indeed , back in 1981 , the " @entity14 " incident saw a @entity12 attack submarine carrying nuclear - tipped torpedoes run aground on the shoals not far from the @entity2 naval base at @entity19			1
fast forward more than three decades , and @entity20 is by no means the threat -- materially or ideologically -- that the @entity12 was during the @entity10			1
but the fact that the @entity5 leader has made it clear that he does not accept the advance of democratic regimes onto @entity28 's doorstep -- whether they be tied either to the @entity30 or @entity31 -- is bound to mean that this latest incident will have echoes of times past for many @entity2			1
and @entity35 has been willing to match words with action			0
with a plan under way to modernize @entity28 's military over the next decade , @entity38 has increasingly been willing to flex its armed muscle not only in @entity43 , but against other neighbors as well			1
in the case of @entity2 , this has included @entity5 simulated air attacks against @entity48 , the buzzing of @entity2 ships and planes by @entity5 aircraft and , as recent as this september , the alleged violation of @entity2 airspace by two @entity5 su - 24s , a supersonic attack aircraft			0
@entity35 's jabs at @entity2 are undoubtedly also tied to the fact that the government of @entity2 has , in reaction to @entity35 's revanchist policies , increased its operational ties to @entity31 and neighboring @entity31 states even while remaining formally outside the alliance			1
in fact , the submarine chase that is now occurring comes on the heels of @entity2 's participation in a @entity69 military exercise that included vessels and aircraft from @entity71 , @entity72 and the @entity73			0
such cooperation is needed precisely because @entity2 has , like the rest of @entity76 , spent much of the @entity78 era cutting its defense budget and the size of its armed forces			0
for example , @entity2 's navy today has fewer than 10 surface combatants , no operational anti-submarine warfare helicopters and only five submarines			2
it was only two years ago that @entity2 's top military officer admitted that his forces could only defend a small segment of the country for about a week without outside help			0
all this suggests that the hard reality is that @entity2 is in @entity38 's sights -- and not just because @entity48 leans toward the @entity96 in its policies			1
the region 's geography means that any conflict in the @entity69 region would almost certainly involve @entity2			2
@entity102 , @entity28 's major military enclave on the @entity69 , is hemmed in by @entity72 and @entity104 on its borders and @entity2 by the sea , and control of the latter 's airspace and seas could be decisive if a major conflict should occur			1
in mid-september , @entity2 went to the polls and rejected a third term for the center - right coalition that had governed @entity2 since 2006			0
the new government is an alliance of left - leaning parties led by the @entity118 and has pledged to increase defense spending			0
no doubt , news of a possible @entity5 sub trolling in @entity2 waters will bolster public support for the government 's decision to up @entity2 military capabilities			0
the question @entity48 will face is whether the planned increase -- less than $ 1 billion over 10 years -- will be sufficient to make up for the two decades of decline and adequate to deal with @entity5 plans to expand its military strength			0
for decades , the @entity2 government has avoided taking explicit sides between @entity136 and @entity38			2
but the @entity2 will find sitting on the fence to be increasingly uncomfortable when @entity35 is your next - door neighbor .			2

@entity28 is by no means the threat the @entity12 was during the @entity10
but @entity38 has increasingly been willing to flex muscles with neighbors , says @entity144
