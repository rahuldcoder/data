-- employers in @entity2 have started paying compensation to women who have developed breast cancer after working night shifts			1
studies have shown that nurses working night shifts have an increased risk of developing breast cancer			1
thirty - eight eight women have so far received payments via their employers ' insurance companies , the @entity12 told @entity0			0
to qualify for compensation , women must have developed breast cancer after having worked at least one night shift a week for 20 to 30 years			1
the amount of compensation depends on the severity of claimants ' illness and their ability to work			0
the move came after the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) , part of the @entity29 , concluded that night work is " probably carcinogenic to humans , " in october 2007			1
@entity32 developed breast cancer after 30 years working as a flight attendant for @entity35 , a job where night shifts were the norm			1
she told the @entity39 that had she known the effects of night working she would n't have flown for so many years			0
the @entity27 classifies the cancer risk of night work as " @entity43 " -- the same as using sun beds -- and just one group below confirmed carcinogens like asbestos and mustard gas			1
the @entity27 reviewed published scientific literature and found that long - term night workers have an increased risk of breast cancer			1
dr @entity53 , head of the @entity54 , told @entity0 that the evidence in humans is limited to breast cancer because researchers have historically studied nurses and flight attendants			2
@entity53 said he would like to see studies carried out on different types of workers in other industrial settings			0
he added that the human studies are consistent with laboratory research that exposes animals to changing patterns of light and dark to mimic the conditions of humans working at night			0
it is thought that night work can disrupt the circadian system , which can alter sleep patterns , suppress melatonin production , and affect genes involved in tumor development			2
" this is a very important topic and it needs more research , " said @entity53			0
" working at night or disrupting your sleep cycle is a widespread phenomenon and it is important to understand the health implications			0
there could be other cancers or other health implications involved			0
