@entity0 , @entity1 -- lawyers for convicted september 11 conspirator @entity4 urged an appeals court panel monday to throw out his guilty plea and grant their client a new trial			1
they argued @entity4 did not have an adequate defense and lacked key information to defend himself			1
@entity4 is serving a life sentence at the federal prison in @entity13 known as @entity14			2
legal analysts believe the appeal has only a slim chance of success			1
in arguments before the 4th @entity22 @entity21 , lawyers for @entity4 said he was confused about the charges he was pleading guilty to , and he did not have access to information that would have shown he was not supposed to be part of the 9/11 plot			1
one defense lawyer characterized @entity4 as " unknowing			2
" defense lawyers point to statements , later made public , from the man who plotted the attacks , @entity32 , who said @entity4 was not intended to be a participant			1
@entity4 did not know what @entity32 had said because it had been classified			2
" a guilty plea that is invalid is invalid , " defense attorney @entity37 told the three - judge panel			1
a @entity41 lawyer strongly countered , telling the court @entity4 's plea was voluntary and unconditional			1
referring to a letter @entity4 sent the district court at the time of the plea , @entity41 attorney @entity44 said , " he understands what he is pleading guilty to			1
" @entity44 told the court @entity4 knew in general that there was information that could help his defense but chose to plead guilty anyway , thereby waiving any right to now challenge that decision			1
" he understood there was stuff out there , " @entity44 said			0
" he knew the gist , " referring to redacted copies of appeal court rulings about what detainees might testify to and the 9/11 commission report			2
in april of 2005 , @entity4 pleaded guilty to terrorism conspiracy charges , and in may of 2006 he was sentenced to life in prison after a jury decided not to impose a death sentence			1
@entity4 , who is being held at the maximum security federal prison in @entity13 known as @entity14 , was not in the courtroom for the hearing			2
it 's expected to be several months before a ruling is issued			0
his attorney was met with mostly skeptical questioning by the judges			0
" he insisted on pleading guilty and was allowed to do so only after extensive efforts to assure that it was knowing and voluntary , " said former @entity22 attorney @entity78 , adding the district judge presiding over the case tried to make sure @entity4 's rights were protected			1
@entity4 's attorneys argued his original defense team , which vehemently tried to dissuade him from pleading guilty , should have been able in an unclassified way to brief their client on the contents of the classified information so he knew the full scope of the evidence			1
they had " one hand tied behind their backs , " @entity37 said			0
the judges hearing the case and the @entity41 attorney pointed out he probably would have received some of that material if he had gone to trial instead of pleading guilty			0
" it is his choice to pull the plug " on the process and plead guilty , @entity44 said			0
another argument made by @entity4 's team was that he was denied the right of counsel because he could not hire a lawyer he wanted			1
after telling the court he did not want the court - appointed attorneys to represent him , @entity4 tried to be his own attorney			2
but after constant outbursts the judge ended that effort			0
the court - appointed lawyers then took over the defense , but @entity4 never had a good relationship with them			1
he wanted a @entity124 lawyer from @entity125 , @entity126 , to be his attorney , but @entity126 did not have security clearance			0
@entity4 was arrested in august of 2001 in @entity129 after instructors at the flight school he was attending reported he was acting suspiciously and did not have much flying experience			2
throughout his legal proceedings he changed his story -- at first claiming he was not supposed to be part of the september 11 attacks and then saying he was scheduled to fly a fifth plane that day and then reversing himself back to his original claim of non-involvement			1
his sentencing trial , which included evidence collected by the @entity142 relating to the 9/11 attacks , was supposed to showcase how a high - profile terrorism suspect could be tried in federal civilian court			0
but his trial ended up delayed for several years over a series of legal fights , including his attempt to defend himself , which included rants in the courtroom and the defense trying to gain testimony from some of the high - ranking @entity156 detainees in @entity22 custody			2
several relatives of those who died in the 9/11 attacks traveled to @entity0 for the hearing			0
@entity162 , whose husband was on the plane that went into the @entity165 , told @entity2 , " people need to know this process works			0
" @entity168 , whose wife worked in the @entity165 , said attending the hearing shows " we are still interested			0
... we are still supporting the legal process			0
" both @entity162 and @entity168 attended every day of the 2006 sentencing trial			0
with the prospect that more terrorism suspects could be tried in federal courts with the promised closing of the @entity178 , @entity162 and @entity168 say @entity4 's case shows the civilian trials can work			1
however , the appeal judges grappled with such key questions as how to guarantee a terrorism detainee access to classified information without compromising national security , and how to determine what degree of involvement in a terrorist plot is needed to justify a death sentence			0
analysts say some detainees , because of evidence and other reasons , should be brought to trial in other systems			0
" the extraordinary challenges of balancing national security with the rights of a terrorism defendant in a civilian trial vividly illustrate why the new administration should consider the use of military tribunals for at least some of the @entity178 detainees , " said former @entity22 attorney @entity78 .			0

defense lawyers say 9/11 conspirator lacked key info to defend himself
@entity4 sentenced to life in *connection* with september 11 attacks
*prosecutors* say @entity4 's guilty plea came voluntarily
legal analysts believe appeal stands little chance of success
