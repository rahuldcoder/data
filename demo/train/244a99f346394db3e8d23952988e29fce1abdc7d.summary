it is a scene seared forever into the memory of an eyewitness : masked men drag the bloodied body of a man across a public square , and tie it to a make - shift cross on a metal pole			1
@entity10 string holds the body 's arms outstretched across a wood plank as blood oozes from the gunshot wound to his head			2
militiamen wrap the body 's black " @entity20 " shirt with a sign in red letters that reads in @entity23 : " this man fought @entity24 and detonated an ied here			2
" the eyewitness -- a man we will call @entity28 -- does more than watch			2
he steps closer and snaps a picture with his cell phone ; the children around him gawk at the horrific spectacle with quiet curiosity			0
@entity28 asked that his identity be kept secret for fear of reprisals			0
his photographs document the story of a body staged to look like a crucifixion -- and to send a message -- in the northern @entity44 city of @entity45			1
an @entity47 splinter group , @entity46 ( @entity46 ) , says the brutal display serves as a lesson to anyone who dares challenge its rule			1
three days on , the " crucified " body of the man and another victim were reportedly still hanging in @entity45			2
" what they are conveying is those who oppose @entity46 rule oppose @entity64 's rule , and those who are enemies of @entity46 are enemies of @entity64 and deserve the highest form of punishment possible , " says @entity56 , assistant professor of @entity46 studies at @entity58			1
the jihadist group carried out a total of seven public executions in @entity45 on tuesday , but only two bodies were displayed afterward , according to the @entity72 , a @entity73 - based monitoring group			1
@entity28 , a member of a recently formed @entity75 activist group in @entity45 , says the remaining five victims were children under the age of 18 , one of them a seventh - grade student			1
the crucifixion displays began in march , when @entity46 accused a shepherd of murder and theft , then shot him in the head and tied his lifeless body to a wooden cross			2
video on social media showed the body leaning up against a small building painted to bear the group 's flag and name			2
" these violent acts are part of a fundamentalist revival campaign , but these forms of ancient punishment were rarely if ever seen in the @entity100 world in recent centuries , " @entity56 says			0
" it has become a standard feature of fringe @entity105 groups to revive these outdated practices in an effort to bring back what they believe is authentic			0
" there 's been no evidence of actual crucifixion , a painful form of execution in which victims were bound or nailed through the hands and feet to a heavy wooden cross and left to suffer until death			0
all three men in @entity45 were shot in the head prior to being affixed to crosses			1
the displays of their bodies appear to be largely symbolic acts by @entity46 followers against members of their own @entity100 sect for perceived acts of treason			1
" @entity46 needs to attach meaning to their killing			2
simply murdering in a state of constant warfare is void of value , so they must attach a message or propaganda to what they are doing , " @entity56 says			0
as @entity44 's civil war creates a power vacuum , groups like @entity46 have stepped in with their own form of radical @entity148 law to rule over an exhausted and terrorized civilian population			1
edicts often appear overnight on inconspicuous flyers , with dire warnings : " all shop owners must close their stores immediately upon the announcement of prayer and go to the mosque , " a decree posted this week reportedly reads			0
" any violators after the issuance of this announcement will face consequences			0
" according to a set of rules issued to @entity45 's @entity168 minority , members of the faith must pay a special tax to the militants and may not expose crosses , repair churches , or recite prayers in the presence of @entity24 , the @entity72 reported in february			1
but while crucifixion holds specific biblical resonance , the bold and brutal displays in @entity45 hold no direct correlation to @entity168 symbolism , @entity56 says			2
the @entity46 victims whose bodies were strung up on crosses were all @entity100			1
@entity184 chief to @entity44 : please do n't hold presidential elections after nearly a year under the repression of @entity46 , @entity28 and about 20 other activists formed a campaign in april that they called " @entity45 is being slaughtered silently " to push the vigilante group out of their hometown			1
" after we reached the solid conviction , without the shadow of a doubt , that ( @entity45 ) served as the stage of a horrific spectacle that deformed the real core of the @entity44 revolution , " the campaigns founding document reads , " we decided it was about time we stood against those forces of evil			1
" @entity46 reacted almost immediately to the campaign , sentencing the activists to death for " non-belief in @entity207 and their advocacy of secularism , " and offering a large cash prize for any information on their whereabouts , according to the @entity72			1
" it is our obligation to confront them ( @entity46 ) and if we remain scared of them then they will rule us forever			2
it is true this is dangerous and we have received more than one death threat , but we are relying on the popularity of our @entity224 page as protection , " @entity28 told @entity217 via a choppy @entity219 connection			0
on their @entity224 page with nearly 12,000 followers , activists post updates on alleged crimes committed against the people of @entity45 and issue calls to action such as proposing a strike by store owners on saturday to protest an @entity46 tax hike			1
" life here is very hard			0
people are tired and they hate everything			0
if you do n't close your shop during prayer time you get lashes , if you smoke you get lashed , if you say one wrong thing you can be executed			0
it 's that easy for @entity46 , " @entity28 says			1
the @entity184 , the @entity44 opposition and human rights groups have corroborated the scenes of horror in @entity45			1
earlier this year , @entity253 @entity252 said reported mass executions in @entity45 may amount to war crimes , and in a separate report issued last month , her office documented torture and mistreatment , including repeated beatings , of prisoners at schools and hospitals controlled by @entity46			1
" so many families have had people disappear and they have no idea where they are or what happened to them			0
the worst part is people are too afraid to ask about their husbands or sons , " @entity28 says			0
after nearly every friday prayer , a few of these prisoners appear in a public roundabout where dozens of onlookers stand by as charges are hurriedly read and the sentences against the accused carried out , ranging from lashes to executions			0
images of the harrowing scenes often circulate on social - media sites , sometimes posted by accounts claiming to be linked to the extremist group			0
" it is like a waterfall of blood			0
there are more and more executions and now the children watch like they are used to it			0
it is a strange and exciting scene and they are not afraid to look , " @entity28 says			0
@entity46 's military offensive against even its former allies and its savage form of justice led the central @entity47 command to disown its affiliate earlier this year , but the group 's leader , @entity302 , vowed to remain in @entity44 and fight all who oppose him , even fellow jihadists			1
the founders of the peaceful campaign " @entity45 is being slaughtered silently " say they will succeed where others have failed			2
" the word is often more powerful than the bullet , and the will of the people is the most powerful of all , " @entity28 says			0
25 children killed in elementary school bombing , @entity44 activists say			1
