@entity0 , @entity1 -- how long did @entity3 , the man who washed up on the shores of a group of @entity6 last week , spend adrift at sea ? he says it was around 13 months			1
local fishermen in the area of @entity11 from which he set off say he may have been gone for a month longer than that , which more or less matches a document from a local civil protection agency that reports he disappeared in november 2012			1
but some people have suggested he looks too healthy for somebody who 'd been through such an ordeal			0
officials in the @entity1 -- where the bearded , shaggy haired @entity3 turned up last thursday in a heavily damaged boat -- say they 've abandoned efforts to pin down the length of time he spent lost in the ocean			1
" we gave up on trying to find out the truth of how long he drifted , " said @entity27			0
" @entity30 will confirm his story			0
what we 've been concentrating on is his medical condition to see if he 's ok and his repatriation			0
" health improving @entity3 's story has raised questions about how he managed to survive on a small boat for so long			1
" he looks way better than i would have expected for someone who has drifted for as long as he says he has , " @entity27 said wednesday			0
" but there is no question he has drifted for quite some time and he has washed up on our shores			0
" @entity3 has said he lived off fish and turtles he had caught and relied on rainwater , and sometimes his own urine , to try to stay hydrated			1
doctors in the @entity1 have told government officials that the castaway 's immune system is very weak and that his symptoms are consistent with someone who has signs of severe dehydration and a diet of only meat			1
but his condition is improving and he was released from the hospital tuesday			0
one of his first acts was to get a haircut and a shave , ditching his tangled locks and bushy beard			0
" for days he 's been asking for a haircut , " @entity27 said			0
he requested a cut like the one worn by the men on @entity70 , the atoll where he was found , she said			0
a fishing trip gone awry @entity3 , who says he is 37 , has been identified by @entity11 as a @entity74 citizen who was living in the @entity11 city of @entity76			1
authorities say they plan to repatriate him to @entity74 -- where his parents say they have n't seen him for years -- once his health is recovered and his documentation is sorted out			0
since @entity74 does n't have diplomatic ties with the @entity1 , @entity11 officials are coordinating the arrangements			1
@entity3 says he set off from the port of @entity85 , near @entity76 in @entity11 's @entity87 state , in december 2012			1
local fishermen in the area told @entity91 newspaper that they remember @entity3 setting off earlier , in november that year			2
he says he and another man intended to spend a day trying to catch sharks , but they were blown off course by northerly winds and then caught in a storm , eventually losing use of their engines			0
according to @entity27 , @entity3 said that four weeks into their drift , he lost his companion because he refused to eat raw birds			1
there are no details yet on what @entity3 did with the man 's body			2
@entity108 , owner of @entity3 's boat in @entity11 , identified @entity3 's companion as 23 - year - old @entity111			1
@entity3 has said that his faith in @entity113 kept him going through the ordeal , but that he also contemplated suicide when he ran low on food and water			2
across an ocean if @entity3 's story proves true , the trip across the @entity120 would have taken him across roughly 6,600 miles ( 10,800 kilometers ) of open ocean before ending in the @entity1 , about halfway between @entity123 and @entity124 , in the @entity125			1
such an amazing journey is n't unheard of in the small @entity120 nation , as three @entity11 fishermen made a similar drift voyage in 2006 that lasted nine months			1
those men lived off fish they caught and rainwater , and they read the @entity133 for comfort			2
conditions in the @entity120 make the timeline of @entity3 's journey plausible , according to @entity138 , a producer for @entity139			2
@entity138 said that given the average currents between @entity11 and the @entity1 , it would have taken less than a year to travel from the origin to the end in the strongest average currents			1
if the trip did indeed take 13 - 1/2 months , it means his boat would have averaged about 18.6 miles ( 30 kilometers ) a day			2
but @entity138 said a meandering journey in and out of the currents was most likely			0
journalists @entity150 reported from @entity0 , @entity1 , and @entity2 's @entity152 wrote from @entity153			2
@entity2 's @entity154 and @entity155 contributed to this report .			0
