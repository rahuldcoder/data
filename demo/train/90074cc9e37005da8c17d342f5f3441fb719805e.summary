his broken bones include both wrists , collarbones , shoulder blades , cheekbones and every single one of his ribs , as well as a leg , arm and ankle not to mention the punctured lungs			2
most of his teeth are replacements having been knocked out in the line of duty			2
has there ever been a sports person as dominant as jockey @entity19 ? his achievements dwarf those of seven - time formula one world champion @entity22			1
his success arguably surpasses that of @entity26 in his major - winning pomp			1
@entity26 is one of @entity19 's idols -- the pair are pictured together in his @entity31 avatar -- and they played together in a pro-am in 2010			1
in the aftermath , it was @entity36 that was left waxing lyrical about his playing partner , astounded that @entity19 was still standing after his litany of injuries			1
but one of the greatest sporting legacies of all - time will draw to a close at the end of april , when @entity19 officially retires			1
the 40 - year - old , who announced his shock decision at @entity49 last weekend , looks set to climb out of the saddle with a 20th consecutive @entity52 @entity51			1
one more triumph will mean he has taken the crown every year since he first turned professional			0
his dominance is hardly surprising when you consider his is now well past 4,300 career victories			2
has anyone greater ever sat in the saddle ? @entity52 jockey sir @entity60 managed 4,870 winners but those were in the world of flat racing where falls are notoriously fewer and farther between			1
the @entity65 estimates he has fallen over 1,000 times and he is well known in the @entity67 of a host of hospitals in @entity70 and @entity71			2
for all those knocks , he has ridden on regardless until announcing his decision live on @entity52 television : " i want to go while i 'm still enjoying racing and while i am still near the top			1
this is without doubt the hardest decision i 've ever had to make			0
i 've been dreading this day			0
" to become a jockey was the best decision i 've ever made and i will really miss it			2
this is something i 've been very luck to have as a great way of life for the last 25 years			0
but time waits for no man in sport and it 's not going to wait for me			1
" his rivals will no doubt breathe a collective sigh of relief at his impending retirement			0
former jockey - turned - trainer @entity92 tweeted his former rival after the news : " hated riding with u. tried to dislike u but could n't			2
" fellow jump jockey @entity98 joked that @entity19 is " made of concrete " such was the manner in which he was able to bounce back from falls that would have written off lesser mortals to ride his next winner moments later			1
and trainer @entity105 labeled him " the iron man			0
" it may be a career history awash with big wins from the notorious @entity110 , the world 's most famous jump jockey race , in 2010 , to two victories in the @entity114 , the main event of the annual @entity116 , often referred to as the @entity117 of the horse - racing world			1
but the injuries aside , it has come with other difficulties			0
at 1.78 meters , @entity19 is tall for a jockey and in order to keep his weight down , has spent the past two decades and more competing at 65kg when his natural weight is closer to 76kg			1
as a result , he treats himself to just two steaks a year as part of a meager diet along with routine saunas and scolding hot baths			0
a teetotaler , he claims to have touched neither drink nor drugs in his life , instead adamant that racing is his drug			0
amid all that , he has shone in the sport with a career win record of 24 % -- most top jockeys struggle to get in the high teens -- and in the region of 30 % this season to date			1
it is no wonder his fellow riders simply call him " @entity148			0
" news of his impending retirement came after riding his 200th winner of the season -- mr @entity153 at @entity49 -- for the ninth time in his career			1
in typically understated fanfare , there was no press conference , he had not even told his parents			0
the only ones that knew were the bookmaker @entity161 , who has @entity19 riding his horses on a retainer of $ 1.5 million a year , his agent @entity164 and his wife @entity165			1
and he had only told her just five days before his public announcement			0
it is 23 years since he rode his first winner as a 17 - year - old in @entity71 before competing for the first time in @entity172 in 1994			2
there is just one regret , that he never rode 300 winners in a season -- his best being 289 in the 2000 - 01 season , in itself a record			0
that triple century had initially looked on the cards last season only for injury to peg him back : " i thought i could ride 300 winners and the fact it was taken away from me broke my heart			0
" on the impending retirement , he added : " it is emotional because i am retiring from something i really like doing			0
that is why it is tough but it 's the right thing			0
" so what lies in store in the future ? for now , he says he has no idea but much like former jockey @entity198 did , he has also put pen to paper on a first novel			2
" taking the @entity204 , " came out last year with jockey @entity202 in the starring role			2
a second , " @entity208 , " is due for publication in october so expect more works of fiction			0
so remarkable have @entity19 's achievements been and so massively have they surpassed those of any of his predecessors or peers , one would have previously thought them a work of fiction .			1

@entity52 jump jockey @entity19 calls time on his illustrious career
arguably the greatest jockey of all time , dominating his sport like no other
over 1,000 career falls , though , have taken their toll on his *ailing* body
