-- to many who watched his long , rambling video statement , @entity5 leader @entity4 appeared strangely distracted , unfocused , perhaps under the influence of drugs while boasting of abducting nearly 300 @entity9 schoolgirls			1
but there is calculation in such cruelty , and method where some see madness			0
the kidnapping serves @entity4 on many levels , and observers of @entity5 say he should not be underestimated			1
@entity4 's on - camera performances are the opposite of the composed appearances of late @entity23 leader @entity22 and the terror group 's current chief , @entity24			1
@entity26 , an expert on @entity5 with the @entity27 , a @entity29 - based research and analysis firm , says @entity4 has even acknowledged the intellectual chaos of his presentations			1
but they impress his followers			0
@entity4 speaks classical @entity34 and @entity35 , the language of northern @entity9 muslims , and had a religious education			1
as deputy to former @entity5 leader @entity40 , who was killed in 2009 , @entity4 delivered sermons littered with references to @entity44 scholars			1
he also expressed admiration for @entity23 as a jihadist movement , although @entity5 is not an affiliate of the group			1
@entity4 's rejection of the @entity51 calendar and of allegiance to the @entity9 flag resonates in a region where resentment of a corrupt and distant government runs deep			1
and his frequent reference to the great @entity58 -- a @entity60 kingdom that ruled northern @entity9 for some 500 years -- harks back to a golden age			0
he is also ruthless in dealing with dissent			1
@entity4 has no deputy and @entity26 says that videos issued by the group never show other commanders			1
" he kills anyone who challenges him , but to blow him off as a madman would be to underestimate his capabilities , " says @entity26			0
twice wounded himself -- in 2009 and 2012 -- @entity4 appears to revel in violence			1
after a series of attacks in @entity75 in 2012 , he said : " i enjoy killing anyone that @entity77 commands me to kill , the way i enjoy killing chickens and rams			0
" nor would @entity26 be surprised if @entity4 were under the influence of drugs when he recorded his video statement ; they have sometimes been found in @entity5 camps by the @entity9 military			1
' i said i would ... ' the mass abduction of teenage girls yet again delivered on a threat that @entity4 has made repeatedly			1
" western education " is a prime target of @entity5 because in the group 's view , it reinforces colonial and @entity51 influence and suppresses @entity44			1
in a july 2013 video , @entity4 promised that schools would be burned and teachers killed			2
he has been true to his word			0
in february , a school in @entity9 's northern @entity102 was attacked and burned down , leaving 29 boys dead			0
and last september , more than 40 students at an agricultural college were killed			0
in abducting so many schoolgirls , @entity4 may also have wanted to humiliate the @entity9 government just as the @entity108 gathered in the @entity9 capital , @entity110			2
@entity111 , a human rights activist in northern @entity9 who has previously been involved in mediating with @entity5 , believes the abduction and other recent attacks are messages to the @entity9 government that the recent arrest of @entity5 followers in @entity44 schools will be avenged			1
in 2012 , @entity4 's wife and three children were reportedly taken into military custody			2
" every time people have started talking about the decline of @entity5 , it has emerged as deadlier and more fierce , " @entity111 told @entity0			2
" this is about a strategy of violence more than about ideology			0
" rewarding the fighters @entity5 has suffered several setbacks in the last year			2
the emergence of civilian vigilante groups in cities like @entity132 has pushed it into rural areas and the @entity9 military has gone on the offensive against the group			0
according to @entity111 , @entity5 now does most of its recruiting in the countryside , coercing or financially inducing vulnerable youngsters from poor homes to join its ranks			2
the mass kidnapping of the teenage girls from @entity144 may have been part of an effort by @entity4 to reinforce the loyalty of these largely uneducated young men by providing them with " free servants or sex slaves , " @entity26 suggests			1
in his video , @entity4 said of the girls : " we would also give their hands in marriage because they are our slaves			1
" " many will likely end up becoming mothers -- it 's a real horror and over the next years we 'll slowly hear the stories of girls few - by - few as they manage to make it out , " @entity26 told @entity0			0
@entity4 's unbending , almost medieval @entity164 sees girls and women as servants for whom education is a sin			1
" women must go and marry , " he said in the video statement			0
you ca n't get them back the location of the abduction and the numbers involved were shrewd choices by @entity5			2
the girls were pulled from their beds at the school , loaded onto buses and trucks and swiftly transported to remote , hilly , forested areas in the northeastern corner of @entity9			0
@entity5 fighters are able to cross the permeable borders with @entity187 and @entity188 for resupply and to hide out , and @entity191 officials believe some of the girls may already have been taken out of @entity9			1
@entity111 said the timing was no accident : the school was full of both @entity60 and @entity51 pupils taking their final exams			0
" they are likely to be in rural , mountainous and forested areas on the move with fighters , with some forced into marriages , " he told @entity0			0
@entity26 says it will be very tough to get them back			0
" @entity5 has likely split up or sold the girls into many small groups , " and they can be used as human shields in the event of an attack , he said			1
@entity111 also dreads any military operation			0
" any attempt to rescue the girls by force will end in a tragic result -- it could be @entity9 's @entity221 , " he said , referring to the attempt to free hostages at a school in @entity214 in 2004 that left more than 300 dead , many of them children			0
bargaining chips for prisoners , cash or concessions @entity4 is not beyond negotiating with the @entity9 government , despite his apocalyptic rhetoric and frequent denials of president @entity230 's legitimacy			1
according to the @entity233 , negotiations in @entity232 a year ago were on the verge of producing " an apparent peace agreement that was to begin with a ceasefire			0
" then @entity4 was designated a terrorist by the @entity238 and abandoned the talks			2
@entity111 believes @entity5 targeted the girls to force concessions from the @entity9 government -- beginning perhaps with the release of @entity5 followers from prisons			1
" the fact @entity4 said he would sell the girls and did not say he would kill them is a clear indication that negotiation is possible			1
@entity4 's video is not going to be the last word from the group on the girls			1
" and @entity111 suggests the notion of selling the girls should not be taken literally			0
" people do n't buy girls in this part @entity257 , " he said			0
but at least some of them may be traded for ransom money			0
@entity5 has begun trading hostages for cash -- most notably in the case of a @entity264 family kidnapped in northern @entity187 last year and reportedly freed for some $ 3 million			1
it also threatens business leaders in the @entity266 with abduction or worse unless they pay up			0
the international outrage sparked by the abduction also serves @entity4			2
" he does n't care at all about international opinion but he knows it has put pressure on the government to reach out to him , " @entity111 said			0
just how that process might work is unclear , but @entity111 has called for a group of @entity44 clerics and others to be set up to seek mediation			0
that would require recent laws banning anyone from having contact with @entity5 to be waived			2
few believe @entity5 is going to wither away until the government addresses inequalities in the allocation of funds between the @entity51 oil - producing south and the @entity60 north			2
@entity111 says the stakes could not be higher for the region			0
" for now , @entity5 's focus remains @entity9 , but as they become emboldened they will spread like a cancer throughout central and @entity257			2

@entity4 is ruthless when dealing with dissent among his followers
he took the reigns of @entity5 after the death of @entity40 in 2009
some analysts wonder if kidnapped girls will be used as bargaining chips
