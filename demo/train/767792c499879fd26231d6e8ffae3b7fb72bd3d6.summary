in response to a report that his health was failing and that he had been rushed to the hospital , @entity1 president @entity0 said thursday that he had the best proof that his recovery from chemotherapy is advancing fine			1
" i 'm here ; this is my answer , " @entity0 told reporters at the presidential palace , raising his arms and gesturing at his body			1
the president announced in june that doctors had removed a cancerous tumor from his body			1
he underwent chemotherapy in @entity19 the following month			2
wearing a red track suit and a baseball cap , @entity0 appeared to be his old talkative self thursday , running through the " irresponsible " newspaper report paragraph by paragraph and answering questions from reporters for more than an hour			1
the @entity28 , citing two unidentified sources who said they were witnesses , reported thursday that @entity0 had been taken to a military hospital on tuesday because of kidney complications			1
the report said doctors were considering moving the president to a private hospital where he could be better attended			1
but @entity0 told the state - run broadcaster @entity35 in a telephone call that he was recovering well from his fourth round of chemotherapy			1
then he called for the afternoon news conference at the palace			2
before answering questions from a crowd of watching reporters , the leftist left - hander threw a softball with his aides and then switched to a hardball			1
" i 'm going to start practicing baseball or softball , both things , " he said			2
my legs are asking for a little running , jogging , some sun. being in the barracks for too long is not good for a man who 's used to being at the forefront			2
but , well , we have to follow the rhythms of medical science			2
" asked by a @entity65 reporter what type of cancer he has , @entity0 -- who said he was recuperating from his last round of chemotherapy , which ended 11 days ago -- would not specify			1
" i am my own answer , " he said			2
" and the life that i will live from now on -- with the favor of @entity71 -- will be my response			2
" but he said that his last medical examination had yielded " very positive results			0
" that extended to his cholesterol level , which he said he had been watching for many years			0
" it 's normal now , but it could be lower , " he said			0
he said he retained an appetite			0
i used to weigh 84			0
of course , i 'm not doing a lot of exercise			0
i 'm doing light exercise , but when i start to run and to hit balls and steal second base ... " about his cancer , the president said only that a tumor the size of a baseball had been removed from his body in a six - hour operation carried out in @entity19 in june and that it was cancerous			1
" fortunately , for those who love me and for me , it was encapsulated , " implying that it might have metastasized had it ruptured			0
" the body was protecting itself , " he said			0
referring to reports that the cancer affected his colon and his kidneys , he said , " all that is false			1
" and responding to media reports that he is dying , he said , " here i am			2
" but , he acknowledged , " i 'm not in my best form			0
" he compared his foot movements to those of former heavyweight champion @entity107 , whom he referred to by his given name of @entity107			0
the disinformation is part of a campaign that " many media outlets , including some represented here , " were part of , he said			0
" it 's a morbid thing			0
it 's morbid , obscene , inhumane			0
but , oh , well , that 's how things are in the world , right ? " he added , " this is like a soap opera			1
" the president also revealed that he had been one of the voices calling for the release of two @entity65 hikers in @entity127			1
@entity128 and @entity128 were detained for two years before being released this month			0
@entity0 said that he called and wrote to @entity127 president @entity129 seeking the hikers ' release at the behest of actor @entity133			1
@entity0 said he considers @entity133 a friend , and after the two spoke about the hikers , he agreed to add his voice directly with the @entity127 president			1
" if this call and message helped a little , i am glad			0
even if it did n't , " he said			0
last week , a representative for @entity133 confirmed a report that @entity133 had flown to @entity1 months ago to speak about the hikers ' plight with @entity0 .			1

" this is like a soap opera , " @entity0 says
@entity0 appears before reporters , saying he is fine
he says he spoke with @entity127 president about freeing 2 @entity65 hikers
a newspaper reports @entity0 was hospitalized for failing kidneys
