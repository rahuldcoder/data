conditions in @entity2 sterilization clinics are under renewed scrutiny after a doctor was removed from his job for using a bicycle pump to inflate women 's abdomens during the procedure			1
health officials in @entity12 state have launched an investigation after reports that bicycle pumps were used on 56 women undergoing sterilization surgery at a government - run community health center in @entity20 , @entity21 district , friday			1
the physician was identified as dr. @entity23 , a retired surgeon who carried out work when required for the clinic , said @entity12 health secretary @entity26			2
she said he would no longer be called on to work for the clinic , and could face charges as a result of the inquiry			0
when contacted by @entity33 , @entity32 refused to comment			0
equipment missing @entity26 said the medical equipment that should have been used in the procedure -- a carbon dioxode insufflator -- had been provided to the clinic , and investigators would try to determine why it was not used			0
but @entity41 , a health official in the district where the procedures took place , said inquiries revealed the insufflator was missing , which is why the bicycle pump had been used instead			1
a health official who did not wish to be named told @entity33 that the use of bicycle pumps in sterilization surgery was widespread			1
in the wake of the incident , state health officials issued a directive that all sterilizations must be carried out according to correct protocols			2
' might burst abdomen ' in sterilization surgery , the patient 's abdomen needs to be inflated to allow room to move surgical instruments			1
dr. @entity63 , the chief medical officer at the @entity65 medical institute in @entity66 , told @entity33 that using a carbon dioxide insufflator allows a doctor to measure and calibrate the amount of pressure placed on the abdomen			0
using a bicycle pump -- a method @entity63 said he was alarmed to hear about -- is highly dangerous			1
" if you use a bicycle pump , you do n't know how much air you 're pumping in and you might burst the abdomen , " he said			1
dr. @entity77 , the chief medical officer for @entity21 district , said none of the 56 women who underwent surgery on friday reported any problems			0
deaths ' almost inevitable ' for decades , in a bid to curb population growth , the @entity2 government has run a nationwide sterilization program			1
particularly in poorer , rural areas , where access to other forms of contraception is limited , sterilization is a popular option			0
women are paid to have the operations , and doctors are given incentives to perform them			0
but health advocates claim that conditions at the mobile clinics where the procedures are often performed , known as sterilization camps , are sometimes unsanitary and dangerous			2
last month , a surgeon was arrested on charges of negligence and attempted culpable homicide in the deaths of a dozen women who had undergone sterilization operations at a mobile clinic in @entity111 , one of @entity2 's most impoverished states , which borders @entity12			1
dr. @entity114 , assisted by a team of fellow medical professionals , operated on 83 women in a span of six hours , including 12 who subsequently died			2
government guidelines stipulate doctors should conduct no more than 30 sterilization surgeries a day			0
@entity114 blamed the deaths on drugs given to the women after the surgeries			0
@entity127 , a @entity66 - based advocate with the @entity128 , told @entity33 at the time of the deaths that they were " almost inevitable ... given the unsafe , unethical and unhygienic conditions that persist throughout @entity2 in these camps			2
" " you might find that there is no electricity , there is no running water , there is not enough staff in these facilities , " she said			0
