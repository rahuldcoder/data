-- this is the week , every year , when you come across special displays in bookstores			1
( finding bookstores these days is a challenge of its own , but that 's a subject for another time )			1
during the week after @entity10 and before january 1 , many bookstores set up tables near the front door featuring calendars and blank journals			2
if the calendars are n't sold by the first day of the new year , they 're probably not going to be sold at all			1
and , next to the calendars on the table , those blank journals , wordless for now			2
waiting for the soundless starter 's whistle of @entity22 -- waiting for someone to fill them in			1
what they represent is one of mankind 's oldest and fiercest desires : the opportunity to start afresh			1
to turn over a new leaf			0
" new leaf " refers not to the world of plants , but to the formal , even archaic , term for a two - sided piece of paper			0
to turn over a new leaf means to flip to a new page			0
to try to do better -- to close the cover on the scratch - outs and unsatisfactory scrawls of the previous part of one 's life and , having learned from what went before , to start over on a clean set of pages			1
" @entity49 , " in the @entity51 expression : blank slate			0
and what to do with that blank slate ? each december , each person makes his or her own pledges			2
this december there has been a phrase that has been much in the news : first responders			1
it is a relatively new description			0
in earlier generations , the people to whom it applied were referred to simply as police officers or firefighters or emergency squads			1
the people who , in times of great trouble , run toward the peril and not away from it			0
every day , in every part of the country , they humble us with their courage and commitment			2
the first responders we have been reporting on and reading about as the old year nears its end have given new meaning to " above and beyond the call of duty " : the officers who sped to @entity85 in @entity86 , @entity87 , and encountered what no person should ever have to see			1
the volunteer firefighters in @entity91 , @entity92 , who were unconscionably cut down in a murderous ambush as they selflessly reported to a predawn blaze			2
the men and women who without hesitation risked their lives trying to rescue the victims of @entity100			0
very few of us will ever have the courage or the training or the physical strength of the first responders who have been in the news this year			1
but , by following the spirit of their example , we can set a goal for the new year that is about to begin -- for those blank pages of life that await			2
unlike those who wear uniforms , the rest of us are not expected to hurry to crime scenes or fires or places of mass injury			0
but , far away from the wail of sirens , there is so much hurting and loneliness that surrounds us in this world , so much need and hunger and solitary despair			0
you do n't have to wear a badge to be a first responder ; you just have to keep your eyes open and be willing to help			0
to be the one who , without being asked , responds and offers assistance when no one else seems to be noticing			0
a kind word ; an inquiry about if there 's anything you can do ; a few moments of giving quiet encouragement			2
it is such an elementary , yet profound , decision to make as a new year begins : to choose to be a first responder in the broadest sense of that phrase			1
to be the person ever attuned to the sight and sound of need			1
to move toward that need without being summoned			0
to be the one who can be counted on			0
we have all been inspired and stirred this year by the valor of the real first responders			1
we prepare to enter a new year with all of the pages still blank , in readiness			2
how we fill them in is our choice			0
it awaits us , just around the bend			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity163 .			1

@entity163 : with every new year , there 's an opportunity to start afresh
@entity163 : the phrase " first responders " has very much been in the news
he says few will match the courage of police officers , firefighters
