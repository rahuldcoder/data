@entity0 , @entity1 -- the doors to the headquarters of the @entity7 civil rights group have been welded shut and padlocked , an escalation in a power struggle between two factions claiming leadership of the organization , the two sides said tuesday			1
the doors were discovered shut monday night			0
the rev. @entity14 , a recent aspirant to the organization 's presidency who claims to be on the board , said the doors were welded and padlocked to keep the current leadership out of the headquarters building			1
" they refused to leave the building , and under the law you ca n't remove them forcibly , " @entity14 told @entity2 affiliate @entity20			2
" so what we had to do was make certain we secured the building while no one was inside to protect the safety and security and the integrity of the organization			0
" " i am troubled by this conduct			0
it is the act of reckless individuals , " @entity7 chairwoman @entity37 said in a statement released tuesday			1
" @entity14 has no right to be on @entity7 property , " @entity41 said			1
" his conduct of vandalizing and damaging @entity7 property proves that @entity47 will do anything to try to control the @entity7			2
" @entity41 and her faction say that @entity14 has never been on the board of the @entity7 or been a national officer for the organization			1
the rev. @entity56 was one of the co-founders of the @entity7 , which was formed in 1957 to coordinate protest activities across the @entity59 , the group 's website says			2
the organization has seen a power struggle dating back about a decade , said @entity62 , a retired professor who specialized in the civil rights movement and has been an observer of the @entity7			1
but the current crisis stems from accusations that former officers diverted @entity7 funds into @entity70 accounts , he said			0
those charges remain under investigation			0
a former chairman and former treasurer were removed from the board , and those who backed them formed the faction that is quarrelling with the current leadership			1
@entity14 aligned himself with the faction backing the ousted leaders , @entity62 said			0
@entity14 ran for @entity7 president last year but was defeated by @entity83 , @entity56 's daughter			2
he was then appointed to the board by the faction led by the ousted chairman , a move that a judge has since ruled invalid			0
" that essentially is what this is about : who effectively is going to control the organization , " @entity62 said .			0
