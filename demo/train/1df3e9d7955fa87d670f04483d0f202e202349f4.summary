@entity0 is the clear @entity1 presidential frontrunner , surging to the front of the potential @entity1 pack following his announcement that he 's " actively exploring " a bid , a new @entity8 / @entity7 poll found			1
he takes nearly one - quarter — 23 % — of republicans surveyed in the new nationwide poll , putting him 10 points ahead of his closest competitor , @entity14 gov. @entity13 , who tallied 13 %			1
related : read the entire @entity8 / @entity7 poll here physician @entity16 comes in third , with 7 % support , and sen. @entity19 and former @entity21 gov. @entity20 are both tied for fourth with 6 %			2
that marks a drop in support for all but @entity13 and @entity0 from the last @entity8 / @entity7 survey of the field , conducted in november			2
that poll showed @entity0 in the lead , but only taking 14 % of the vote , while @entity16 came in second with 11 % and @entity13 tied rep. @entity31 for fourth with 9 % support			1
@entity0 's 10 - point lead is a milestone for the potential @entity1 field — it marks the first time any prospective candidate has reached a lead beyond a poll 's margin of error in the past two years			1
former secretary of state @entity41 is still far and away the favorite to take the @entity44 nomination for president if she runs , with the support of two - thirds of @entity44 polled			2
@entity49 sen. @entity48 , a liberal favorite , comes in a distant second place with just 9 %			0
@entity0 would still face some skepticism from @entity1 primary voters if he ran , but the @entity8 / @entity7 poll shows they are largely willing to forgive him for some of his more controversial comments and positions			2
@entity1 primary voters are about evenly split on whether his support for allowing some illegal immigrants to stay in the @entity60 makes them more or less likely to support him , or has no difference on their opinion of him			0
forty - two percent say his description of illegal immigration as an " act of love " make them less likely to support @entity0 , but another 39 % say it makes no difference to them			1
and while 40 % say the fact that state government spending increased under @entity0 's watch as @entity74 governor , another 49 % say that does n't matter to them			0
even on @entity78 educational standards , which many conservatives vehemently oppose , @entity1 primary voters are about evenly split on whether his support for those standards would make them less likely to support him			0
regardless , however , @entity0 may ultimately have little trouble overcoming his sins with the conservative base , as the @entity8 / @entity7 poll found @entity1 primary voters taking a pragmatic stance on the party 's nominee			1
sixty - nine percent say they want a nominee that can beat the @entity44 candidate for president , even if that person does n't agree with them on every issue , while only 29 percent of @entity1 primary voters are purists			0
and that makes @entity0 the candidate to beat in a @entity1 primary			1
out of all of the seven head - to - head @entity1 match - ups with @entity106 tested , @entity0 fares the best , trailing her by just 13 points			1
she takes 54 % support to his 41 % support			0
the survey was conducted by live interview among 1,011 adults nationwide from dec. 18 - 21 , with a subsample of 453 republicans and 469 @entity44 , via landline and cell phone			0
the overall sample has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points .			0

@entity0 leads the @entity1 field by 10 points , with 23 % support
it 's the first time any candidate has taken a statistically - *significant* lead over the @entity1 field
he 's also the strongest @entity1 candidate in a match - up against @entity41
