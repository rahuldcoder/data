@entity0 -- nearly four years into his speakership , @entity2 is stronger than ever			2
@entity2 will be elected to his third term as speaker on thursday , a few days before his 66th birthday			1
he 's already facing post-election grumbling from conservatives , but his position is remarkably secure for a speaker whose tenure has been marked by the drama of the debt ceiling standoff , the government shutdown and the battles within the @entity16			1
the @entity18 @entity17 will soon preside over the largest @entity20 @entity16 majority since @entity21 and have a new partner in the @entity23 when @entity24 , @entity25 , becomes majority leader			1
@entity2 will still confront plenty of challenges as he shifts from being the face of the opposition party in @entity31 to a leader aiming to prove @entity17 can govern ahead of the 2016 presidential election			2
conservatives say they are worried that @entity2 and @entity35 may put too much emphasis on proving they can make a dysfunctional @entity31 work without focusing enough on laying out an agenda that sets up a clear contrast with @entity41			2
@entity43 @entity16 rep. @entity42 , a frequent @entity2 critic from the right , told @entity1 that the midterm elections were a mandate for change and " change was n't compromise with the president			1
" he said " what won the election in 2014 was bold conservative principles and solutions			0
" social conservatives @entity42 said he agrees with @entity2 's pledge to again pass a series of @entity16 economic measures next year that the @entity41 - led @entity23 ignored			1
but he insisted that the @entity16 base also wants to see a @entity31 take measures backed by social conservatives , and he cited " traditional marriage and pro-life bills			2
" @entity2 and @entity35 , meanwhile , have largely stayed away from talking about social issues			2
" if they define success as passing bills that the president signs , that is setting themselves up for failure over the next year , " said @entity64 , spokesman for @entity65 , a conservative group that has clashed with @entity2 in the past			2
@entity64 said the list of economic items that the two @entity17 leaders listed in their op - ed published in the @entity79 last week was on target , but viewed by conservatives as just " a good start			0
" the expanded @entity16 majority will give the speaker a bit of a cushion so he can push back against the band of @entity20 conservatives who thwarted his legislative strategy and pushed the @entity20 to shut down the government last fall			1
over the last four years , the speaker has reminded his own members who wanted bolder action that he faced limits on what he could do because he only controlled " one half of one third of the government			0
" " most of us were tired of hearing ' this is all @entity104 will agree to ' - that 's so 2014 , " @entity42 said , referring to the current @entity23 majority leader			0
opposing @entity2 other @entity2 critics already plan to vote against him serving another term			2
a small group of @entity16 candidates who were elected last tuesday night campaigned on the pledge they would oppose @entity2 remaining speaker			1
but the movement is n't big enough or sufficiently organized to cause any serious trouble			0
there is an effort , backed by @entity2 allies , to get those who oppose him to do so behind closed doors on thursday			2
this would avoid the embarrassment he endured in 2013 when live @entity124 cameras showed a dozen @entity20 @entity17 voting for someone else or skipping the vote on the @entity20 floor when @entity2 began his second term			1
@entity42 is one of those who publicly opposed @entity2 two years ago			0
@entity2 stripped him of his seat on the @entity131 after a series of splits with @entity16 leaders in 2012			1
@entity42 told @entity1 " the speaker and i have our disagreements " but that he planned to vote for him this time			0
he said he spoke with the speaker recently , but declined to describe the " private discussion			0
" the problem for those in the @entity143 crowd is they do n't have an alternative candidate			0
@entity147 @entity146 rep. @entity146 , who is popular among many conservatives and considered a leadership bid , decided he wanted to remain in his current post as the chairman of the powerful @entity152			0
it is true that some of the new @entity20 @entity17 are just as conservative -- if not more so -- than the members they replaced			0
but several @entity20 republicans and leadership aides all say that numerically " it 's a wash " in terms of how big of a group of rabble rousers @entity2 can expect to deal with in the next @entity31			1
many of those in the right wing of the @entity16 conference who split with @entity2 were fueled by support and encouragement from outside groups			1
but these groups lost a lot of their clout and credibility after the spending confrontation they demanded led to the shutdown , which @entity2 warned would damage the @entity16 's message after the surprise defeat of @entity2 's former number two - @entity178 - who many viewed as his only possible successor , @entity2 has worked to solidify his power			1
@entity2 spent most of the summer and fall months traversing the country campaigning for @entity17 candidates and collecting political chits			0
he visited 175 cities and remained the top @entity20 @entity16 fundraiser - - bringing in a whopping $ 102 million for @entity16 candidates from his various political committees			1
' strong position to persuade ' @entity2 is " in a strong position to persuade , " @entity16 rep. @entity191 told @entity1			1
as a 24 year veteran of the @entity20 who once served as the @entity195 , @entity2 is an institutionalist			1
he and @entity35 are both masters of the behind the scenes legislative maneuvering that is little noticed by the public , but can lead to important deals			0
it 's still unclear how willing @entity2 will be to give any major concessions and work with the president and @entity41 to pass items like new infrastructure programs and new trade authority			2
there 's a sense that corralling what can sometimes be a rambunctious @entity20 @entity16 conference is a job that no one else besides @entity2 is prepared to take on at this point -- or even wants			1
when republicans gather this week , @entity2 is likely to walk a fine line between telling his members what they want to hear about pushing conservative legislation next year , while starting to set some expectations			0
those who have split with the speaker say their disagreements have never been personal , and he 's earned genuine respect			0
many enjoy it when he leads the infamous " @entity2 birthday song , " a fun , very short ditty members use to mark birthdays and now share on @entity229			0
" who else has a birthday song that everyone sings ? he 's clearly endeared and ingrained himself in a way that 's quite unprecedented , " @entity191 told @entity1 .			0
