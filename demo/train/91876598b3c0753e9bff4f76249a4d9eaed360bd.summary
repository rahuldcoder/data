-- @entity3 still has about 1,000 troops inside eastern @entity5 , a @entity2 military officer said thursday , a week after @entity5 's government and @entity8 rebels agreed to a ceasefire aimed at ending months of conflict			1
@entity2 also sees 20,000 more @entity3 troops aligned along the border , the @entity2 officer told @entity0			1
he was not named according to standard practice in the organization			0
@entity2 believes that these numbers amount to a large and effective military force , the officer said			2
in addition to the troop numbers , @entity2 continues to see sophisticated @entity3 military equipment in @entity5			1
@entity2 remains concerned and urges @entity3 to engage with the international community and @entity5 to find a political solution to the crisis , the officer said			1
@entity24 has consistently denied allegations by @entity26 and the @entity27 that @entity3 has troops in @entity5 , and that it has armed and supported the rebels			1
on wednesday , @entity5 president @entity30 said some 70 % of the @entity3 troops believed to have been in @entity5 had withdrawn back across the border , according to the national news agency @entity33			2
information released by @entity5 's @entity36 on thursday indicated that the rebel forces control a strip of eastern @entity5 running from the city of @entity40 down to the @entity41			2
' very fragile ' ceasefire the truce was signed friday after talks in @entity45 , @entity46 , between representatives of @entity5 , the rebels and @entity3			1
but more substantive talks on issues , including the decentralization of power and constitutional reform in @entity5 , must still take place before a lasting resolution can be found			0
@entity3 @entity57 spokesman @entity56 told a briefing thursday that the ceasefire was " very fragile " and that both sides must implement the framework agreed to in @entity45			1
" there is mounting evidence of the @entity26 government strengthening its military groups in different areas , regions ; there are eyewitness reports to prove it , " he said , " though @entity5 authorities keep on reassuring us that they 're not planning a military operation			1
" @entity56 said @entity3 was also surprised by @entity2 's announcement of plans to hold joint military exercises with @entity26 in @entity5 later this year			1
" this might cause the escalation ( of the situation ) and put the progress in peaceful settlement of the crisis in @entity5 under threat , " he warned			0
new sanctions a new round of @entity89 sanctions against @entity3 over its actions in @entity5 will come into force friday , @entity86 president @entity85 said thursday			1
@entity89 officials will review the implementation of the ceasefire before the end of the month , he said , after which the sanctions could be amended or lifted			2
the sanctions include tougher restrictions on @entity3 's access to @entity89 capital markets ; a ban on loans by @entity89 companies or individuals to five major @entity3 state - owned banks ; a ban on debt financing to three major @entity3 defense companies and three major energy companies ; and an asset freeze and travel ban against 24 more individuals			2
this means 119 people in total are now subject to sanctions , while 23 entities remain under an asset freeze in the @entity89			0
@entity3 has warned it will respond to any additional measures			0
in his remarks , @entity56 said the deadly crash in july of @entity123 -- which @entity26 and the @entity27 believe was shot down from rebel - held territory using a @entity3 - made missile launcher -- was being used to justify the imposition of broad @entity129 sanctions against @entity3			2
a preliminary report into the crash released this week by @entity132 investigators did not apportion blame for the crash but said the plane was brought down by " high - energy objects " from outside			0
the @entity137 will join the @entity89 in implementing additional sanctions against @entity3 over its " illegal actions in @entity5 , " president @entity136 said thursday			1
" we will deepen and broaden sanctions in @entity3 's financial , energy , and defense sectors , " he said			0
the administration will outline the specifics of the sanctions friday			0
" we are implementing these new measures in light of @entity3 's actions to further destabilize @entity5 over the last month , including through the presence of heavily armed @entity3 forces in eastern @entity5			1
we are watching closely developments since the announcement of the ceasefire and agreement in @entity45 , but we have yet to see conclusive evidence that @entity3 has ceased its efforts to destabilize @entity5 , " @entity136 said			1
aid convoy @entity56 also said there had not yet been a " breakthrough " allowing a new @entity3 aid convoy to start moving into @entity5 in the next few days			0
" we hope that the delivery will be carried out with participation of @entity5 's border guards and customs officers as well as officials from the @entity168 , " he said			0
" we hope , however , that the coordination would not be dragged out			0
" a previous convoy carrying aid for civilians caught up in the fighting in the @entity175 and @entity40 regions was sent over the border by @entity3 without permission from @entity5 authorities			0
the presidents of @entity3 and @entity5 are " broadly satisfied " with the status of the ceasefire , @entity180 foreign policy adviser @entity179 told @entity3 's @entity185 news agency on wednesday			2
@entity0 's @entity186 in @entity26 and @entity187 in @entity24 contributed to this report			0
@entity0 's @entity189 also contributed .			0
