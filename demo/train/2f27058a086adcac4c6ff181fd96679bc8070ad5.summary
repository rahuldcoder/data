-- " @entity0 should be transparent			1
transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their government is doing			1
... my administration will take appropriate action , consistent with law and policy , to disclose information rapidly in forms that the public can readily find and use			1
" -- president @entity17 , memo to heads of executive departments and agencies , 2009 " the basis of our governments being the opinion of the people , the very first object should be to keep that right ; and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers , or newspapers without a government , i should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter			1
" -- @entity35 to lt. col. @entity36 , @entity37 , 1787 journalists are hardwired to be pro-transparency , pro-leaks and pro-whistleblower			2
they 're not supposed to cozy up to the powerful ; they 're supposed to confront them			2
their job is n't just to comfort the afflicted , but also to afflict the comfortable			2
and above all , the media have a sacred duty to act as a watchdog against the excesses of government			2
and if there is one thing that the @entity17 administration finds itself with an " excess " of at this point -- a little more than 100 days into its second term -- it 's government excess			1
this @entity57 has been horrible at transparency			0
in 2010 , in more than a third of the requests for public records , the @entity17 administration did n't provide any information			1
in fact , the administration has released fewer records under the @entity66 than were released during the @entity68 administration			2
and in the case of " @entity71 , " where @entity73 law enforcement agents allowed illegal guns into @entity75 so they could track them -- and then lost track of them -- we 're no closer to knowing the truth about who was responsible			0
attorney general @entity79 was held in contempt of @entity81 during a dispute over requested documents and president @entity17 went so far as to invoke executive privilege to keep from releasing those same documents			1
the administration knows all about secrecy			2
nonetheless , these days , you need a program to keep straight all the scandals of officials in the executive branch secretly doing things they 're not supposed to be doing			0
the @entity96 is investigating the @entity97 for unfairly scrutinizing conservative groups thought to be aligned with the tea party			0
and so who will investigate the @entity96 for spying on the @entity101 ? the @entity97 should do it			1
just to keep things even			0
welcome to the @entity17 administration 's chaotic version of the second - term curse , where the common theme is government officials , either with or without the blessings of higher - ups , abusing their power			1
the @entity101 revealed this week that the @entity96 , in april and may 2012 , used subpoenas to secretly help itself to two months ' worth of phone records from journalists			1
those targeted included at least five reporters , an editor and @entity101 @entity119 bureau chief @entity118			1
the @entity96 was interested in the conversations of anyone who worked on a may 7 , 2012 , story about the @entity123 thwarting a terrorist plot in @entity125			0
the administration wanted to know who was leaking information to the @entity101 , so rather than monitor the phone lines of its own employees , it monitored the phone lines of the journalists who might be receiving that information			1
according to the news agency , 20 different phone lines were tapped , including not just work phones and the @entity101 's main switchboard , but also the journalists ' home and cell phones			1
in all , according to the @entity101 , when you count all the people who came in contact with the phones in question , more than 100 journalists could have been affected			1
is it cold in here ? i just felt a chill down my spine			0
it is all part of the government 's aggressive crackdown on leaks to the media			2
the @entity17 administration has prosecuted six leak - related cases			1
that 's more than all previous administrations combined			0
on monday , @entity101 president and ceo @entity160 fired off a letter to @entity79 condemning this " massive and unprecedented intrusion " into the agency 's reporting			1
@entity160 wants the @entity96 to return the phone records and destroy any copies			0
that would the smart thing to do			0
i 've known @entity160 for more than 20 years , since he was a young publisher of my hometown newspaper in central @entity172 , the @entity173			0
he 's a smart and tough newspaperman who originally came into this business as a media lawyer			0
he wo n't be intimidated , and he wo n't let this go			2
when the government counterpunches , @entity160 will hit back even harder			2
the counterpunching has already begun			0
on tuesday , deputy attorney general @entity179 sent a letter to @entity160 defending the decision to grab the phone records			0
@entity179 insisted that the subpoenas were " drawn as narrowly as possible " and aimed at collecting " limited subject matter			0
" not good enough , said @entity160 in a quick response			0
saying that @entity179 's letter did not " adequately address our concerns , " @entity160 questioned how such a sweeping investigation could be called " narrowly drawn			0
" my friend is right on the money , and he 's right to raise a ruckus			0
a line has been crossed here			0
every journalist in @entity73 ought to be outraged by the hubris of this administration , as should every @entity73 who believes -- along with @entity35 -- that the press has a solemn duty to inform the public as to what government is doing in its name			1
and it 's hard for the media to keep tabs on the government when the government is busy keeping tabs on the media			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			1

president @entity17 told agency heads to make sure government is transparent
@entity213 says administration has n't delivered on that goal
he says monitoring of the @entity101 shows a disregard for the proper role of journalists
