-- @entity2 's smog - ridden capital issued an unprecedented set of new anti-pollution measures at the weekend , as the authorities scramble to respond to rising public pressure over the city 's deteriorating air quality			1
the far - reaching measures target everything from outdoor barbecues and dusty construction sites , to paint fumes and idling car engines , representing the city 's broadest effort yet to fight the persistent pollution haze over @entity18			1
the @entity18 city government published a draft of the new rules on its website on saturday and asked for public feedback -- an unusual step that illustrates how carefully the government is treading around the hot - button issue			1
earlier this month , an episode of extraordinarily bad pollution in @entity18 sparked public outcry over air quality , as well as causing a sudden increase in hospital admissions for respiratory illnesses and heart attacks			1
@entity2 's double - digit economic growth in the past three decades has been accompanied by widespread environmental degradation , of which air pollution in the capital has become the latest , and most visible , symbol			1
although the @entity18 city government has in the past tried to conceal its pollution problem by manipulating air quality data , public pressure has forced it adopt a radically more open stance			1
the city government now publishes hourly pollution data and even pollution forecasts to help citizens deal with the haze			0
in a sign of the growing severity of the problem , the new regulations published on saturday describe " emergency measures " for days when pollution becomes a " danger to human health " , including mandatory factory closures and restrictions on vehicles			2
the draft rules also outline a new cap - and - trade scheme for key pollutants , and will require the largest culprits to publicly disclose their emissions -- which environmentalists said was a step toward greater transparency			2
" the draft law it is really trying to tackle the issue in a proactive way , trying to tackle the pollution at its source , " said @entity69 , a prominent environmentalist in @entity18 and author of @entity2 's @entity71			2
however , he added that firm implementation of the rules , which has thwarted similar environmental laws in the past , would continue to be a challenge			0
the draft regulations , which span dozens of pages , also describe a range of smaller measures that could change some of the key features of life in the capital , if strictly implemented			0
restaurants and caterers will be banned from burning coal -- a measure that will threaten @entity18 's beloved lamb kebabs , known as yangrou chuan			0
vehicles will be prohibited from idling their engines for more than three minutes if parked near a school or a hospital , and cars will be subject to random testing for emissions compliance			0
some parts of the new regulations simply reiterate rules that were already in place -- such as requirements for dust - control measures at construction sites -- but have been poorly implemented because the environmental authorities have lacked clout			2
" to make this happen the key thing is oversight , " said @entity110 , air pollution specialist at @entity112 in @entity18			0
" the government put this up on the web because they understand that everyone is watching this issue -- this is a big improvement			0
