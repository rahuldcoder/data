@entity0 -- a darkened room in a @entity0 university building is an unlikely portal into an ancient world			1
but with the touch of an @entity8 , the space is digitally transformed into a 1,500 - year - old @entity10 grotto			2
its walls decorated with exquisite but faded paintings of enlightened beings , dancers and musicians			0
another swipe and a pair of @entity20 glasses brings the cave to life			1
@entity24 pigments show how the cave must have looked when the paint first dried and animation and magnification reveal the tiniest of details			2
" we can turn up all the lights , we can also fly up to the ceiling , " says artist and academic @entity31 , as he controls the virtual environment			0
@entity31 , an @entity36 , co-leads a team at the @entity38 at @entity0 's @entity39 , which has pioneered the immersive digital technology -- harnessing advances in cinema , computer games and virtual reality			1
they believe the techniques developed will help preserve key heritage sites in @entity48 before they are irrevocably damaged by the onslaught of mass tourism			1
" the primary concern is how to maintain the integrity of these caves for posterity , " @entity31 says			0
the team has worked on similar projects for @entity57 in @entity58 and @entity59 in @entity60 but say this is the most ambitious in scope			2
the cave featured in the prototype is part of a larger complex located thousands of miles north of @entity0 in the @entity68 city of @entity69 , once a @entity71 oasis and now a @entity73 world heritage site			1
for almost two thousand years , the @entity75 , as the caves are known , withstood marauding barbarian hoards , earthquakes and the @entity79 's shifting sand dunes			2
today , the caves and their frescoes face a different and perhaps more potent threat -- how to manage the increasing number of tourists that come to see caves			0
some 680,000 tourists visited in 2011 and that number was exceeded by at least 100,000 last year			0
but the steep rise in visitors over the past decade has raised the level of humidity and carbon dioxide inside the caves , undermining conservation efforts			0
the grotto depicted by the team at @entity39 is already closed to tourists and only 70 of the 492 decorated caves are open to the public			1
the pressures brought by the surge in visitors at @entity69 are shared by many heritage sites across @entity68 and @entity48 , as the region 's newly affluent middle class begin to travel in greater numbers			1
@entity108 , the vice director of the @entity109 , which is responsible for looking after the caves , says the optimum capacity for the @entity75 is 3,000 people a day			0
however , on october 2 , during @entity68 's week - long national day break , more than 18,000 tourists visited the site			1
plans are underway to limit visitor numbers through an online reservation system but @entity108 says that the use of digital tools to capture the caves before any further deterioration is a priority			1
a 50 - strong team is documenting the site through extensive high - resolution photography and @entity20 laser scanning			1
each cave takes three months to document and the project is thought to be unparallelled in scale compared to similar efforts at other heritage sites			1
a new visitor center is due at the end of 2013 that will have a feature film theater and a @entity20 reproduction of the original caves			2
" it will help regulate the number of tourists and reduce the time spent in the caves on guided tours , " @entity108 says			0
" this will greatly alleviate the pressures brought by tourism on conserving caves that are on display			0
" the @entity109 and its digital team collaborated closely with @entity39 in designing the cave recreation , which is called " @entity151 : inside the @entity75 at @entity69			1
" the installation was shown outside @entity68 for the first time in december when it was exhibited at the @entity154 in @entity155			2
after some refinements , the technology will also be deployed at @entity69 , allowing visitors to interact with the caves in a completely different way			0
" you could say it 's a surrogate experience of visiting the caves but it 's not merely mimicking a visit , " says @entity31			0
" once you 've got the cave in a digital representation you can do very special things with that you ca n't necessarily do in the actual cave			2
" a magnifying glass allows you to explore the one - to - one scale virtual environment , which depicts seven figures known as @entity173 and other traditional images			0
faded incense burners , lutes and harps were drawn by hand with traditional brushes before being scanned and modeled in 3 - @entity180 and experts in traditional dance at the @entity183 were filmed in a blue - screen studio to bring to life their ancient painted counterparts			0
the effect is disarmingly beautiful and not at all gimmicky but will visitors to @entity69 be satisfied at marveling at a recreation rather than the real thing ? @entity31 says they may have to be			0
sealing caves to ensure their preservation is becoming an accepted practice despite debate over whether heritage sites should be hidden from public view			1
most famously , the @entity198 in @entity199 , which depict 17,000 - year - old paintings of prehistoric animals , were closed to the general public in 2008 after the caves were beset by fungus and black mold			0
there are no current plans for a similar move at @entity69 , but @entity31 and his team believe that their digital technology may be the ultimate solution to the site 's preservation -- and others like it .			1

ancient @entity10 cave in @entity68 *re-created* in @entity20
techniques developed by team at @entity0 's @entity39
they hope these digital tools will help preserve heritage sites in @entity48
