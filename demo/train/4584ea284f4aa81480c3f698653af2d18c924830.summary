@entity0 -- if that corner office at a financial firm on @entity8 's @entity7 or at @entity10 's @entity9 has been illusory , then a @entity3 view from @entity0 's skyscraper skyline may be the place to find yourself in a few years			1
that 's because the @entity14 city looks set to become the center of the @entity16 when it comes to jobs in the financial sector			1
@entity20 , the @entity10 - based economics consultancy , recently forecast @entity0 will have more financial services jobs than @entity8 or @entity10 by 2016 , with some 262,000 positions			1
the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) also gives its endorsement , saying @entity0 will be the world 's premier financial job center by 2017 , with 275,000 positions			1
believable or bizarre ? " it 's three years from now , but it 's believable , " says @entity29 , director of @entity30 , a @entity0 - based boutique headhunting firm focused on the banking and financial sectors			1
" @entity14 opportunities are going to be a lot more stable			2
( the employment market ) has been slow because of the @entity40 and @entity41 economic crises -- not because of major issues from our side			2
" @entity29 says he does expect continued job volatility on the so - called " sale side " of the financial industry , which includes investment banking , because of sensitivity to market gyrations			1
but he already sees more hiring on the less - market sensitive " buy side , " which includes asset and wealth fund management			1
but other search firms find recent job market forecasts far - fetched			2
" i think it 's bizarre , " says @entity58 , managing director of @entity59 , a financial and corporate headhunting firm headquartered in @entity0			1
as the global economy has slowed over the past few years " @entity0 is shedding jobs			1
" this past september , @entity64 finished its planned @entity0 layoffs by eliminating 3,000 staff from its workforce in the city -- part of a global restructuring to cut an astounding 30,000 jobs around the world			1
earlier this month , @entity74 announced it will cut up to 2,000 jobs with many of those losses coming out of @entity14 and @entity40			1
@entity58 expects even more job losses in @entity0 are " still to come			1
" as proof , @entity58 cites a steep drop - off in recruitment requests from global banks based in @entity0			2
he declines to name them but says they are easy to guess			0
" the amount they spend on recruiters is 80 - 100 % down			0
they have n't spent anything on headhunters in the past year			0
" still , @entity20 's chief executive @entity91 is preaching the message that @entity0 will boast the most financial jobs by 2016			1
he says it is " inevitable as a result of the world 's changing economic geography			1
" and @entity0 will be boosted by the internationalization of the renminbi ( @entity101 's currency )			1
but we have accelerated the ( @entity104 - to - @entity106 job ) shift through short - sighted overregulation , penal taxation and banker bashing			0
" despite those reasons , financial executives from the @entity104 will not necessarily secure a new job in the @entity106			0
three ls language ability , links across @entity14 and localization are prime deciding factors for the success of a financial services job seeker			1
" ' how good is your @entity120 ? ' is one of the first questions you will be asked , " says @entity59 's @entity58			0
" @entity101 's market has been badly serviced by private banks " and opportunities exist if you can speak the language			2
the second question will be about the strength of your regional relationships across @entity14			0
" people have to have relationships -- not just from doing well in the front office but to asset management and private wealth management in particular , " says @entity58			2
" the longer one has lived in @entity101 , the better			0
the best is if you 've grown up here			0
" " ( financial services firms ) are getting people who understand the local markets , " adds @entity138			0
" they will hire a @entity143 to cover @entity143 markets , @entity145 to cover the @entity145			0
we do see a large inflow of @entity40 and @entity41 bankers ( seeking jobs ) , but ( they are ) finding it very difficult to get a job here because they do n't understand the local markets			2
it 's a safer bet to pick someone local			0
" a third question correlates with culture -- literally how far are you willing to go to give " face			0
" " i recently had a qualified candidate lose out , " says @entity58			0
" he is a @entity143 national who had lived in @entity0 but is currently based in @entity161			0
the guy who got the job is a local @entity164 , and he 's here			2
he had a face - to - face - interview			0
a phone call or a video call just is n't the same			0
" " being here gets you 70 % of the way			0
" looking ahead two years , the decision to relocate from @entity104 to @entity106 hinges on whether you believe financial jobs will be easier to find in @entity0 -- as opposed to @entity10 or @entity8 -- and whether you believe you are that much better than the competition .			1

reports *suggest* @entity0 could become the world 's financial *capital* in terms of jobs
many jobs expected to be on " buy side " of industry , in asset and wealth fund management
*analysts* expect more job volatility on " sale side , " which includes investment banking
local *knowledge* , language *skills* *increasingly* *important* in @entity14 market
