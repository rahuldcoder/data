@entity0 -- last year , the @entity2 authorized " all necessary measures " to stop the violence when the nation in question was @entity6			1
it has come nowhere close to that on @entity10 , where the @entity0 estimates more than 5,000 people have been killed since march			2
why ? diplomats say the answer is simple : @entity14			2
tensions between @entity14 and the other permanent members of the @entity2 have always been a factor			0
but diplomats say that @entity14 's conduct in its refusal to condemn @entity10 , or even negotiate on resolutions in good faith , have reached new lows			1
at this point , the only way @entity26 diplomats believe the @entity2 will be able to pass a resolution on @entity10 is with a request for intervention from the @entity31			1
@entity14 and @entity32 abstained from the vote on @entity6 after the @entity31 and the @entity34 requested @entity0 involvement in that country			1
in october , @entity14 and @entity32 issued a rare double veto of a sanction-less resolution that would have condemned the violence in @entity10			1
though @entity32 joined @entity14 in its veto on @entity10 , and @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 abstained , diplomats say that it is @entity14 that has been taking the lead in opposition to action			1
in @entity14 's view , @entity49 overstepped the @entity2 's mandate in @entity6 , and they fear a similar mistake being made in @entity10			1
though @entity26 diplomats insist they have not proposed anything approaching military intervention , @entity14 insists that the @entity10 crisis should be solved internally			1
" i think @entity6 has been beat to death , overused and misused as an excuse for countries not to take up their responsibilities with respect to @entity10 , " @entity56 , @entity57 ambassador to the @entity0 , said			1
last month , @entity14 @entity0 ambassador @entity63 pushed the @entity2 to open an investigation into civilian deaths in @entity6			1
@entity67 and @entity57 diplomats immediately called foul			0
" is everybody sufficiently distracted from @entity10 now ? " @entity70 asked the media after a meeting called by @entity14			2
" let us see this for what it is			0
that this is duplicative , it 's redundant , it 's superfluous , and it 's a stunt			0
" " this is not the kind of issue which can be drowned in expletives , " @entity63 countered the next day			0
" you can not beat a @entity87 education , can you ? " referring to @entity70 's alma mater , saying she should be " more @entity90			0
" shortly thereafter , @entity70 's communications director tweeted a picture of @entity63 's face superimposed on the @entity94 , with the text " rough day at the @entity2			0
" ( @entity63 later said that he " thought it was a nice joke			0
" ) despite @entity70 's high - profile tit - for - tat with @entity63 , it is the four @entity67 countries on the @entity2 , not the @entity57 , that have taken the lead on issues @entity6 and @entity10			1
photos : rare look inside @entity10 divisions deepen those countries -- @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and the @entity109 -- have expressed deep frustration at @entity14 's scuttling of attempts at a resolution			1
in december , @entity14 held the rotating presidency of the council , which gave it significant power to determine the agenda			0
diplomats complained of having to fight tooth and nail for even routine briefings			0
a senior @entity26 diplomat said that @entity63 routinely interrupted other diplomats and cut off debate			2
@entity63 's conduct was " outrageous " and " disrespectful , " the diplomat said , who had " never seen anything like the atmosphere in the @entity2 now			0
" western diplomats admit that @entity14 has been using its close relationship with @entity10 to apply pressure on @entity10 president @entity133			1
but their criticism of @entity63 's conduct at the @entity2 is unequivocal			0
" @entity63 is practicing shoe diplomacy , " another senior @entity26 diplomat said , referring to @entity139 premier @entity138 's famous shoe - banging speech in the @entity140			2
" @entity14 and @entity10 are the last two members of the @entity144 , and @entity14 is behaving in an imperialistic manner , " another @entity26 diplomat said			1
@entity63 does not disagree that the mood is contentious			0
but he says that the root cause is a " my way or the highway " attitude			0
he called december the toughest of his five separate month - long terms at the helm of the @entity2			0
" there is a lot of nervousness , a lot of expectations that things are going to be done my way or no other way , " @entity63 said			0
" that what i need to have , i must have now			0
... i think that if this trend were to continue it might seriously hurt the ability of the @entity2 to work			0
" @entity14 surprised even its allies last month when it introduced its own draft resolution condemning the violence in @entity10			1
publicly , @entity26 diplomats seemed encouraged by the move but privately were deep cynical			2
@entity170 said @entity14 had expected the @entity67 and @entity57 to reject the draft out of hand , because it did not include some of the provisions they consider non-negotiable			2
( and , for example , they say it drew an unacceptable equivalence between violence perpetrated by the government and violence perpetrated by protesters			0
) since then , @entity26 diplomats say that @entity14 has not engaged in negotiation on their proposed additions			1
they also complain that @entity63 has misrepresented to the media the content of closed @entity2 meetings			0
he claims productive work on the draft @entity10 resolution , they say , when in fact he has been stonewalling			2
" we are working all the time , " @entity63 said tuesday of @entity14 's draft resolution			1
they have not held a single negotiation on the text since @entity195 , @entity26 diplomats say			2
@entity26 diplomats admit that when it comes to @entity10 , they are at a " dead end			1
" the only way around it -- the " only game in town , " as @entity106 @entity0 ambassador @entity202 says -- is the @entity31			1
the @entity31 has a group of observers in @entity10 , who were sent there to gauge the situation on the ground			2
their report is expected on january 19			0
if that report is unequivocal about the @entity10 government 's culpability -- an outcome @entity26 diplomats admit is a long shot -- then they may have enough political capital to push forward			1
and in - person briefing from the @entity217 prime minister , who has been very outspoken on @entity10 , or the secretary general of the @entity31 , may help to push @entity14 , they say			1
the @entity31 report , a @entity26 diplomat said , is a necessary condition for action			2
but it may not be sufficient .			0

@entity26 diplomats say @entity14 is stonewalling all efforts to deal with @entity10
the diplomats say best hope for action is request for intervention from @entity31
@entity14 believes @entity49 overstepped in @entity6 and does *n't* want a repeat in @entity10
@entity14 's @entity0 ambassador on a draft resolution on @entity10 : " we are working all the time "
