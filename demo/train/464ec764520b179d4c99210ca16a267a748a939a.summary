@entity0 -- after the grand slams , it 's the most prestigious men 's tournament on the tennis tour			1
the @entity6 start sunday in @entity0 and feature eight of the globe 's top players including two - time defending champion @entity10 , six - time winner @entity11 and @entity13 's @entity12			1
apart from those familiar names , three debutants line up at the @entity16 -- a venue that normally hosts some of the world 's top musicians -- in @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			0
one player who wo n't be there , however , is @entity25 -- the @entity26 underwent appendix surgery this week			1
the show goes on without @entity25 and here 's a closer look at the combatants who 'll vie for a potential prize of roughly $ 2 million			2
@entity33 @entity10 rank : 1 age : 27 tournament history : eighth straight appearance , two - time defending champion @entity10 won another grand slam title at @entity40 , but 2014 has n't been all good for the @entity41			1
he suffered upset losses to @entity43 and @entity21 at the @entity45 and @entity44 , respectively			0
with archrival @entity25 absent at @entity47 due to a wrist injury , " @entity10 " missed a huge chance to collect major no. 8			1
off the court , however , there was much happiness : @entity10 got married in july and became a new dad last month			1
as the champion in 2012 and 2013 and having won 27 consecutive indoor matches , @entity10 begins the tournament as favorite			1
@entity43 rank : 4 age : 29 tournament history : second straight appearance from the middle of 2005 to the end of last year , only one player outside the " @entity63 " managed to win a grand slam title -- @entity67 at the @entity68			0
@entity43 loosened the grip of the all - conquering quartet , though , when he toppled both @entity10 and @entity25 at the @entity45			1
he did get a bit of luck , mind you , as a back injury hampered @entity25 in the final			2
weighed down by being in the spotlight and heightened expectations , @entity11 's countryman has failed to maintain his lofty january level			2
he 's lost four of his last five matches			0
@entity82 rank : 7 age : 29 tournament history : fifth straight appearance @entity82 is popular on social media for his humor and has made waves with his attire at grand slams , particularly his shirt at the @entity45 that resembled @entity94 's football jersey and his flowery offering at @entity96			0
it was another solid season for the @entity98 with the racquet in his hand			0
he achieved the quarterfinals or better at three grand slams and collected a landmark 10th career title			0
yet there 's still no grand slam title for the ever dangerous @entity82 , and he has n't hidden his desire to hire @entity108 as coach			0
@entity20 rank : 9 age : 26 tournament history : debut not even @entity20 could have imagined his reversal of fortune			0
he served a doping ban -- later shortened -- that forced him to skip the @entity44 last year but 12 months later @entity20 powered his way to the crown , easing past @entity82 , @entity11 and @entity21 with the help of his potent serve			2
the opening months of 2014 were n't shabby for @entity20 , either , as he went 16 - 1 during one stretch			2
he has credited his high - profile coach , @entity122 , for boosting his serve -- and belief			0
group b @entity11 rank : 2 age : 33 tournament history : 13th straight appearance , six - time champion it 's been a fine campaign for @entity11 , the @entity132 who often leads the conversation when discussing the greatest tennis players of all time			1
hindered by a bad back in 2013 , he finished last season at no. 6			0
but now he stands at no. 2 and even has an opportunity to eclipse @entity10 -- his ouster in the @entity40 final -- as the year - end no. 1			1
will , though , @entity11 be distracted at the @entity6 ? @entity132 meets @entity143 in the @entity145 final -- the team competition and @entity147 singles gold are the lone two massive titles he has n't won in his record - breaking career -- later in november			1
further , @entity11 landed in the tougher group			2
@entity21 rank : 5 age : 24 tournament history : debut when @entity21 retired against @entity25 in the final of the clay - court @entity157 in may with a back injury , one could n't help but think the flashy @entity159 would be slowed by yet more injury problems -- especially when he fell in the first round of the @entity96 weeks later			1
@entity21 then did n't play in the two most important @entity44 warm - up events because of toe troubles			0
but in that instance he recovered , eliminating @entity10 and @entity43 in @entity165 en route to becoming the first @entity168 man to compete in a grand slam singles final			2
he capped a fabulous four weeks by triumphing in front of his adoring public in @entity172			0
@entity12 rank : 6 age : 27 tournament history : sixth appearance @entity12 did n't surface at the year - end championships in 2013 as he continued to rehabilitate his back -- and he had to work extremely hard to make sure he locked down a berth this year , playing for six straight weeks down the stretch			1
if last year was @entity12 's high - water mark -- winning @entity40 to end a 77 - year wait for a @entity13 men 's singles champion -- this year as a whole has n't been as prosperous			1
the influential @entity108 left his team , @entity12 struggled to find his best form following the back operation and his tweet about @entity190 independence attracted criticism			2
will all of the crowd be behind @entity12 , then ? @entity22 rank : 8 age : 23 tournament history : debut if @entity21 is @entity159 's trailblazer on the men 's side , @entity22 is @entity201 's equivalent			1
whereas @entity21 defeated @entity22 at the @entity44 , the latter upended his slightly older rival on the way to a semifinal showing at @entity40			0
it came about a month after @entity22 made a maiden grand slam quarterfinal at @entity96			0
he 'll no doubt be confident , since @entity22 beat @entity11 at last week 's @entity208 and subsequently made the final			1
though he has made strides from the baseline and in his return game , the serve remains the overwhelming weapon			0
@entity22 passed 1,000 aces for the second time in three seasons .			0

world no. 1 and new dad @entity10 is the two - time defending champion in @entity0
