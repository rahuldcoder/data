staff sgt. @entity11 , a 24 - year - old @entity3 , died in a shower at his base in @entity4 in january 2008			1

" the decorated soldier from @entity29 , @entity30 , was electrocuted in a shower at a @entity7 base in @entity33 that once served as one of @entity36 's palaces			1
the report found that a water pump installed by military contractor @entity39 was not grounded , leading to @entity11 's electrocution when it short - circuited			1

in a statement issued monday afternoon , it said it had not seen the @entity10 report and would not comment			0
" while the death of staff sgt. @entity11 was tragic , @entity39 continues to maintain that it was not responsible for his death , " company spokeswoman @entity62 said			2
" the building in which staff sgt. @entity11 lived was built by @entity4 and other contractors under the previous @entity4 leadership			0
" @entity70 said the building , " like many other pre-existing buildings in @entity4 , had not been grounded or bonded by the contractors who built the structure , " and she said @entity39 had warned the military about the hazard nine months before @entity11 died			0
" prior to that incident , the military never directed @entity39 to repair , upgrade or improve the grounding system in the building in which @entity11 resided , nor was @entity39 directed to perform any preventive maintenance at this facility , " @entity62 said			2
but @entity11 's mother , who has filed suit against @entity39 in her son 's death , said she was " pleased " by the findings			1
" the results are revealing and contrary to what @entity39 and its president have continuously stated over the past year , " @entity87 said			0
" on that note , the @entity92 report states that @entity39 installed the water pump that killed my son , a point that @entity39 has flatly denied over the past year			2
" @entity11 's death led to congressional hearings in 2008 and demands for a full investigation by the military , which resulted in the report out monday			1
@entity30 sen. @entity103 , who pushed for the investigation , said monday 's report should not be the end of the process			0
" we can not stop with the publication of this report alone , " the @entity107 said in a written statement			0
" those who failed to carry out their contractual obligations in a way that contributed to the death of a @entity7 soldier should be held fully accountable for their negligence			2
" another report is being prepared by the @entity46 's @entity120 , @entity103 said			2
