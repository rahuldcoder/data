a man at the center gestures emphatically as some listen and nod			2
here and at coffee shops and barbershops and social spots the debate is much the same : should @entity1 withdraw its troops from @entity21 after terrorists stormed the mall ? the terrorists who attacked the mall on saturday claimed to be members of @entity21 - based @entity26 and barked out their resentment of @entity1 troops in their country			1
" they said , ' we are the @entity26 , we are here to kill you for killing our women in @entity21 , ' " said @entity30 , who hid in a box when attackers opened fire at the mall			1
@entity1 entered a high - stakes gamble two years ago when it sent troops to neighboring @entity21 to flush out the @entity40 militants it accused of kidnapping and killing foreigners in the coastal area			1
the abductions affected @entity1 's once - bustling tourism industry , a major hit to the nation 's revenue			1
@entity26 vowed to attack @entity1 until it withdrew its troops			1
since then , grenades have landed at bus stops , churches , mosques and bars , killing dozens			1
militants have regularly taken to social media to brag about their attacks and to threaten more			2
' we need to protect our borders ' @entity60 , part of the sidewalk debate , said keeping troops in @entity21 is not the best option			1
" we need to get them out , " said the 34 - year - old businessman			2
" they 'll keep killing us , and we 'll continue killing them --- it will never end			2
we should all stop fighting , start afresh			1
" next to him , bank teller @entity70 , 28 , shakes his head vehemently			2
" that 's nonsense , it 's not that easy , " he said			1
" we 're already in too deep			2
we will be considered cowards if we get out			0
they ( @entity26 ) started it by killing and kidnapping people in our own land			0
" @entity79 waves him off			0
he tries to draw in a @entity1 soldier standing guard near the cordoned - off area near the mall			1
" do you guys like being in @entity21 ? " @entity60 asks			1
the soldier glares at him and turns the other way , clutching a long rifle			0
at a barber and hair - stylist shop about 20 miles from the mall , a similar debate is under way			0
@entity94 sits under a buzzing hair dryer			0
she pops her head out long enough to give her two cents , before tucking her head back			0
" the reason the troops invaded is because our borders were porous to begin with , " she said			1
" we need to fix our security			2
we need to protect our borders			0
those troops fighting in @entity21 , we need to bring them home to help with those efforts			1
if we fix our security , we do n't have to fear terrorists			1
" @entity107 , 23 , said sending the troops there was not a good idea to begin with			2
but they should stay , he said			0
" if they want our soldiers to get out , they need to stop killing us , " he said			0
" it 's that simple			2
it was n't worth it to go there over a bunch of tourists , but we are already there			0
we ca n't give up now			0
" the @entity6 standoff ended tuesday , according to government officials			0
it was the worst terror attack in the nation since @entity126 blew up the @entity127 in 1998 , leaving more than 200 dead			0
@entity1 's president steadfast @entity1 is @entity130 's biggest economy and a crucial trade route into the rest of the continent			1
it is also a major @entity136 ally in the war against @entity40 militants in the region			0
it provides an important buffer of stability in a region that includes the fledgling @entity21 government and the politically tense @entity145			1
@entity1 president @entity146 has ruled out the withdrawal of the military , which is now part of the @entity150 forces battling the militants in @entity21			1
" we went as a nation to @entity21 to fight the war against terror unleashed on @entity1 people , @entity21 people and people around the world , " @entity146 said this week			1
" this is not a @entity1 war , this is an international war			1
" @entity163 , deputy director of the @entity164 in @entity0 , said the threat facing @entity1 is complex and withdrawal from @entity21 is not advisable			1
but revamped security in the nation , he said , will go a long way			2
" @entity1 needs to bring its citizens together to recognize security threats , to mobilize them into a common security consciousness and surveillance system that they trust and have confidence in , " @entity163 wrote in an opinion piece for @entity2			1
' do n't ask me about @entity26 ' having seen what happened to many of the victims of the mall massacre , @entity178 said she will do whatever she can to help protect herself			0
a @entity184 , she plans to learn how @entity185 pray and the names of major @entity188 figures			0

" if learning the @entity195 will help save me , i will do what it takes , " she said			0

" government officials have said the terror attack killed 62 people and five of the suspected 15 terrorists			1
at least 61 people remain missing , the @entity1 @entity205 has said			1
back on the sidewalk near @entity6 , insurance agent @entity207 shakes his head when asked his opinion about @entity26			0
" do n't ask me about @entity26			0
i do n't want to hear that word in my life , ever , " he said			0
he 's listening to the debate on the militant group , a brown envelope in his hand			2
in it are life insurance documents for his friend @entity220 , whom he was going to meet at a coffee house at the mall			0
he was in the parking lot on his way to drop them off for @entity220 to sign when he heard gunshots and took off , clutching the envelope			2
his friend never left the mall			0
no one has seen him since			0
" on second thought , " @entity207 said , " let 's improve our security big time , post armed cops in major public venues , do a sweep of areas suspected of harboring terrorists , then keep our troops in @entity21 to do the job			1
" @entity207 passed by the mall every day during the hostage crisis and sat on a sidewalk behind the police barricade , holding the insurance papers			0
they are still in the brown envelope .			0

@entity1 troops have been in @entity21 since 2011 to try to root out terrorists
the terrorists who killed dozens in @entity0 said they resent troops ' presence
some @entity1 say it 's time to get out and start afresh
others say withdrawing is a sign of cowardice and that border security is key
