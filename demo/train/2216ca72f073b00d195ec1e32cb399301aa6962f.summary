-- while @entity3 's recently departed leader @entity2 will probably be most remembered for his pompadour , jumpsuits and relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons , the world must never forget the legacy of anguish and terror he left for millions of his people			1
the @entity3 regime is built on fear : fear , according to reports of defectors , that disloyalty and even minor infractions against the @entity2 family 's cult of personality will lead to a death sentence working in one of the @entity3 's gulags , mining uranium on starvation rations while your family struggles to survive just outside the wire			1
there is fear that the secret police will shut off the electricity to your house and burst in to extract the dvds or @entity38 you were secretly watching to learn about the outside world ; fear that border guards will not accept your bribe or might catch you bringing a @entity42 back from @entity43 , the punishment for which is being bound by wires poked through the ears of other prisoners and marched off to slave labor ; fear that you are in a province suspected of disloyalty by @entity50 and that you might be allowed to slip from malnourishment to starvation when the harvest comes up short again			0
it has been surprisingly difficult to confront @entity3 on these human rights abuses			1
the regime claims that all of its citizens live in a worker 's paradise and that @entity62 or @entity63 criticism is only aimed at confrontation and war , which @entity50 will meet with fire and destruction			1
@entity70 , @entity71 and @entity63 governments have all at one time or another decided that pressure on human rights might distract from diplomatic negotiations over the more dangerous threat from the @entity3 's nuclear weapons program -- which is , of course , one of the reasons the @entity3 wants nuclear weapons			1
the @entity63 political left has also slowed pressure on human rights because they have traditionally seen criticism of the @entity3 as an excuse by past conservative military governments to restrict civil liberties in the @entity63			1
those episodes are happily behind us in today 's democratic @entity63 , but the memories and ideological fissures linger			0
and @entity43 is a major obstacle , resisting pressure on the @entity3 on human rights because of fears it may increase refugee flows across the @entity99 , which runs along its border with @entity3			1
still , the information gets out			0
satellite images show huge prison camps containing as many as 200,000 prisoners			0
defectors like @entity106 have written about life ( if it can be called that ) within the @entity110 camps in his book " @entity112			0
" @entity70 and other foreigners have also opened a window to the suffering of the @entity3 people , including @entity2 , a young @entity117 expert who opened a string of martial arts studios in @entity43 as cover to help @entity3 defect			1
his book , " escaping @entity3 , " is a stunning story of tragedy and heroism			2
there is also more that the @entity70 and other countries can do as a matter of policy			0
first , we should remain consistent in highlighting the @entity3 's record in all diplomatic discussions , including with the @entity3			2
second , we should put more international pressure on @entity43 to allow the @entity135 high commissioner on refugees to visit @entity3 in @entity43 and to stop refoulement ( the forced repatriation of @entity3 against their will )			2
third , we could increase the number of @entity3 defectors we accept in the @entity70 and use our diplomatic leverage with third countries like @entity144 and @entity145 to ensure that @entity3 defectors have the ability to safely make their way to the @entity63			2
fourth , we should not link food aid to political negotiations , and should insist only that we have adequate monitoring to ensure food gets to those desperate @entity3 who need it			2
finally , while we are not well positioned to force a collapse of the regime and must appreciate that its demise would present the danger of loose nukes , we must nevertheless prepare with our allies for massive humanitarian assistance in the event that collapse does happen			0
that scenario would bring risk , but also great hope for 23 million suffering @entity3			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity170 .			0

@entity172 : @entity2 should be remembered for a regime built on anguish , terror
he says @entity3 *deemed* disloyal face *imprisonment* , starvation , torture , death
he says regime 's nuclear capabilities have kept confrontation over rights at *bay*
green : @entity187 must press on rights , help defectors , be ready to aid citizens if regime fails
