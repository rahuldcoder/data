-- @entity2 voters on tuesday appear to have approved @entity3 , a measure banning same - sex marriage in the state			1
@entity0 legal analyst @entity7 says the @entity9 @entity8 may have to rule on the issue of same - sex marriage			1
@entity2 's secretary of state late tuesday released semi-official results showing @entity3 had passed 52.5 percent to 47.5 percent			1
@entity0 has not officially called the result one way or the other			1
on wednesday protesters took to the streets of @entity17 to voice their opposition to the potential ban			2
and there are at least three legal challenges to it now pending in court			1
@entity24 of @entity0 's " @entity25 " spoke thursday with the program 's legal analyst , @entity7 , about the issue			1
@entity29 : @entity2 's attorney general says that the constitutional amendment is not retroactive , and @entity33 mayor @entity32 says he will continue to marry people until someone sues him to stop			1
so what does prop 8 mean first of all to people who want to get married in the state of @entity2 ? @entity7 : well , we already know in @entity17 they are no longer issuing marriage licenses to same - sex couples			1
so in @entity17 , it 's a no go			2
in @entity33 , as you mentioned , the mayor is saying , " we 're still going to be doing it			0
" so for people that are n't married yet , it 's really legal limbo			1
and what about people who from the time that they allowed same - sex marriage , this was in may until november , some 18,000 couples decided they were going to do it			1
what happens to them ? is their marriage still valid ? @entity7 : it 's still valid right now			1
but really they are also in a legal limbo			2
the bottom line it 's all over the place			1
the law is really unclear here			0
last night , i was poring over these legal papers			2
i was also discussing this with a lot of law professors , a lot of different lawyers , and everyone is all over the place			2
some folks said , you know , the bottom line is when you look at the language of @entity3 , it is very clear that it was meant to be retroactive and that means that all the marriages will be invalidated			0
then another law professor that i spoke to said that is absolutely fundamentally ridiculous			0
the bottom line is this is a fundamental right that was given to couples and this is a right that is not going to be given away			0
i think we 're going to see a lot of litigation here , @entity24 , and the bottom line is everyone is in a legal , legal limbo			2
@entity29 : it 's very interesting the grounds for which they are challenging			2
at least in one of these lawsuits they said that it was a constitutional revision rather than an amendment			0
and that means it would need two - thirds approval of the @entity111 in the legislature			2
so do we think it could go to the state house in @entity2 as well as being fought in the courts ? @entity7 : i really think this is going to be a legal issue			1
i think this is going to go before the @entity2 @entity8			1
and we already know as you mentioned that there are three cases pending before the @entity2 @entity8			1
and what is interesting to note is that it 's the very same court that allowed these marriages in the first place			1
and so , my guess is that that court is going to weigh in , probably reinstitute the right to marry for same - sex couples and then that 's going to be likely based on the @entity132 and our @entity8 is going to weigh in			1
what is i think extremely interesting here is that we now know that we have a president - elect , @entity135			0
he 's going to get the opportunity likely to appoint @entity8 justices			1
so we do n't even know which type of court or the makeup of the court that will hear this			0
but i think the @entity8 will likely weigh in on this issue			1
@entity29 : this was such a hot button issue in the state			0
more spending on either side , $ 35 million , $ 37 million on both sides			0
@entity29 : it was the highest funded campaign on any state ballot			0
@entity7 : that 's right			0
@entity29 : they say it trumped every other campaign except the presidential			0
@entity7 : people care about this issue			0
i mean , they 're talking about discrimination , equal protection			0
it 's an issue that 's a hotbed issue			2
we also know , @entity24 , that in @entity165 and @entity166 that this ban was implemented			0
and so , you know , it 's all over the place			2
people care about this issue , and this is an issue that is really present			0
and i think that it 's something that , we , of course , have to watch because we 're talking about equal protection , we 're talking about discrimination			0
people care about these issues			0
@entity29 : @entity7 , great to see you			0
