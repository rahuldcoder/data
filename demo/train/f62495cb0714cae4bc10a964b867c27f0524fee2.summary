-- the world of punditry is divided into two groups : those who attend the @entity5 at @entity6 and those who mock the @entity5 at @entity6			1
( there 's a subgroup that both attends and mocks , but it 's tiny			1
) yet @entity6 is important , whether you attend or no. ( i do n't			1
) and if @entity16 is right , this year something genuinely encouraging may be happening at the grand global gathering of business leaders , politicians and big - thinking academics			1
" as the world struggles to bolster its resilience against economic and political uncertainty , the key risk is the increasing vulnerability of elites			1
we 're seeing leaders of all kinds , in the developed and developing world , in politics as well as business and media , answering to constituents who grow more dissatisfied ... and information - rich			1
look at the riots in @entity44 over the recent rape scandal , the @entity37 ' abysmal approval ratings or the phone hacking scandal at @entity39 , special interests or a lack of transparency will spell trouble for leaders			2
" @entity16 , a brilliant analyst of the global economy , is a regular @entity6 participant			1
he 's recording his impressions of the 2013 conference in a diary for the @entity53			2
if he 's perceiving elite anxiety , one can only say : finally			2
" what all the wise men promised has not happened , and what all the damned fools said would happen has come to pass			0
" so snarked queen @entity60 's first prime minister , lord @entity62			2
he might have been talking about the euro			0
or the securitization of the @entity67 mortgage market			0
or the @entity70 government 's attempt to restore prosperity through budget austerity			2
over the past decade and a half , we 've seen one horrendous economic decision after another made , not by voters in democracies , but by people who owed their power to their claims of superior knowledge			1
together , they have plunged us into a decade and a half of disasters , culminating in a global financial crisis triggered by new credit instruments that were advertised as ending financial crises once and for all			0
@entity90 at @entity6 : focus on trade , taxes , transparency yet by and large , these leaders have escaped public accountability or even criticism over the past six years of global crisis			1
the people who designed the euro continue to run the @entity101			2
the people who wrecked the @entity67 banking system walked away with multimillion - dollar severance packages			2
we all know that life 's not fair			0
but this unfair ? so it 's welcome news that the @entity6 attenders are suddenly feeling " vulnerable			1
elected leaders can at least be removed by the voters			0
not so central bankers , financial regulators , and investment bankers , even though they can ( and often do ) exercise more power than any elected official			0
global ceos lack confidence in 2013 @entity16 appears to suggest that the correct response to elite vulnerability is more transparency			0
i do n't think that 's quite right			0
if banks and regulators were delivering good results , nobody would mind their opaqueness			0
it 's the bad results that drive the demand for transparency			1
but that 's not because we really want more transparency			0
what we really want is more competence and more success and success that benefits the many , rather than lavishly over-rewarding a privileged few even as they ruin everything and everyone around them			0
according to @entity16 , the theme of this year 's @entity6 conference is " @entity148			1
" it would have done better if it had adopted instead the theme , " we messed up			0
" that would open the way to panels on " why we messed up " and " how not to do it again			0
" more cynical attendees might opt for practical discussions on topics like , " how to sound contrite even though you 're not a bit sorry			0
" it 's probably too much to expect the @entity6 gathering to feel any real remorse			1
but if they at least feel fear , that 's a promising start on the way to reform .			1

@entity168 says reports are the elites attending @entity6 feel vulnerable
he says that 's a good sign , given all the harm their decisions have done to the world economy
@entity180 : bad decisions by those with " superior knowledge " have caused great harm
@entity180 : he says people are looking to leaders , expecting them to make better decisions
