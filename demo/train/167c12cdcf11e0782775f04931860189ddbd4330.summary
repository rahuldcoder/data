perhaps it 's the recent launch of @entity1 for brands			1
perhaps it 's because @entity5 founder @entity4 called @entity1 a " little version of @entity5			2
" or perhaps people just enjoy battles between tech titans			0
whatever the reason , i 've been asked at least three times in the past week about whether @entity1 , @entity13 's social networking service , will ever beat @entity5			1
@entity5 is the undisputed champion of social networking , with more than 800 million active users			1
it 's deeply interwoven with the @entity18 -- its social plug - ins are now part of millions of websites , and an entire ecosystem of applications relies on @entity5 for social functions			2
if @entity13 's aim with @entity1 was to topple @entity5 , that 's an audacious goal			2
based on the current growth rates of both companies , it would n't seem to be a bet you could win			0
toppling @entity5 becomes more challenging as that site continues to keep pace -- adding new features along with users			0
friend circles , a distinctive feature of @entity1 at launch , were added to @entity5 in the following months , removing a major incentive to switch			1
what 's more , @entity5 's launch of the " subscribe " feature -- which lets you follow public updates from a user -- further erodes the advantages of using a service like @entity1 or @entity48			1
@entity13 did n't promote @entity1 as a " @entity5 killer , " however			2
the search giant instead explained that it was building a " social layer " to bind its services together			0
that promise is now being delivered upon : a @entity1 activity bar now runs across the top of @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and virtually every other @entity13 service			0
the real value of @entity1 is a very small feature indeed : the +1 button			1
this little widget -- @entity13 's answer to the @entity67 button -- is an acknowledgment that links are no longer the only way to rank websites			0
instead , people are increasingly discovering content through their friends on social networks			0
for @entity13 , a company that ranks web content based on the links between pages , that 's a very scary change that undermines the organization 's core search - engine service			0
so what did @entity13 do ? it launched a social service and put these buttons on almost all of its pages to start collecting some of those social signals			0
now those little +1 votes being cast around the @entity18 are starting to change the order of @entity13 's search results , helping to keep @entity13 in line with the social trend			1
if @entity13 's aim was to create its own source of social voting data and avoid a nightmarish outcome -- being forced to rank your search results based solely on your @entity5 connections -- then , by its own standards , @entity1 is not a failure			1
can @entity13 win the social war outright ? my guess is no. nonetheless , @entity13 could still make a big move to increase the odds : it could acquire @entity48 , gaining ownership of one of the biggest databases of social signals on the @entity111			0
meanwhile , " social " is not the only battle raging in technology circles			0
there 's also the fight for the mobile web : mobile operating systems and app stores are perhaps a bigger opportunity than the social trend			1
and while @entity13 is the market leader in mobile operating systems , @entity5 merely has a few apps ( albeit the most popular ones )			1
so @entity5 , the big blue social network , may be winning a battle with @entity1 but is losing the mobile war with @entity13 at large			2
can @entity1 beat @entity5 ? i think the better question might be " is @entity13 better off with @entity1 ? " the answer , i think , is a clear yes .			2

@entity5 is the champion of social networking , with more than 800 million active users
@entity5 's launch of the " subscribe " button puts @entity1 and @entity48 at a *disadvantage*
the real value of @entity1 is a very small feature indeed : the +1 button
mobile operating systems and app stores are perhaps a bigger opportunity than the social trend
