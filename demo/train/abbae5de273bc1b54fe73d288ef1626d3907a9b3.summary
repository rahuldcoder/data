in 2001 a huge earthquake shook the state of @entity2 in @entity3			1
2,000 people were killed , 400,000 lost their homes , and countless more lost their businesses in the devastation			0
one young entrepreneur , @entity8 , lost everything , but found an innovative way to get back on his feet			0
@entity8 designed a low - cost clay fridge which required no electricity and continued to function in the event of major catastrophes or blackouts such as the one that devastated his village			2
@entity8 's invention is part of a growing trend in @entity3 that has become known as " frugal innovation " -- below - the - radar inventors across the country devising low - cost solutions to local problems , often borne of necessity , using bespoke technologies of their own creation			1
so striking has the trend for frugal innovation become , that last year the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) , an independent charity in the @entity34 , commissioned and published a major research paper on the phenomenon			2
the paper said " frugal innovation is found throughout the @entity3 system : from ... efforts to crowdsource drug discovery driven by government labs , to @entity43 's approach to cutting the cost of mobile phone calls , to the @entity47 approach to palliative care which is providing access to support at the end of life for thousands in a void of formal healthcare			1
" at the forefront of the frugal innovation movement is professor @entity56 who , for the last 20 years , has been travelling across @entity3 in search of local inventors whose creativity has had a positive impact on rural poverty			1
in 1989 , @entity56 founded the @entity62 , an organization that uncovers grassroots inventors , and helps bring their inventions to the world			1
" i have walked about 4,000 kilometers in the last 12 years , " says @entity56			0
" i have tried to map the minds of people who are creating around the country			0
" @entity56 's journey has brought him into contact with inventors who are solving common problems in frugal ways , using traditional knowledge and readily available materials			1
by his own reckoning , @entity56 believes that the @entity62 has helped unearth over 25,000 new inventions , including a motorbike - mounted crop sprayer , a device for climbing trees , an amphibious bicycle and a wind - powered irrigation system			1
@entity84 , the author of @entity33 's report , says " frugal innovation is all about creating advantage out of constraint			2
faced with scarce resources and institutional voids , frugal innovators develop radical new solutions to problems			1
it 's not just about making things cheaper , but better , more appropriate and scalable			0
it involves leveraging available resources in new ways , reducing or re-using waste or even re-thinking an entire system around a product or service			0
" @entity103 , a @entity104 farmer devised just such a product			0
picking cotton in @entity2 is a manual task which , in the past , has frequently been undertaken by children			0
in a bid to reduce the work involved , @entity103 invented a cotton - stripping machine that can be operated by one person			2
professor @entity56 believes the invention has helped significantly reduce child labor in the region			0
@entity117 , a research group run by the @entity118 , seeks to promote exactly this kind of invention			0
the group runs projects in conjunction with @entity3 inventors to build cheap , " hackable " devices to solve enduring problems across the subcontinent			1
@entity128 , project manager for @entity117 , says that there is a lot to learn from " thinking about how you can hack everyday castaway objects			0
" the projects the organization has run in conjunction with @entity3 inventors have already yielded products that are being used around @entity3 today , including a classroom projector fashioned from repurposed cell phone components and a low - cost health screening tool made from an old alarm clock			1
but @entity128 believes that work being done by frugal innovators in @entity3 has yet to have a significant international impact : " people thought we were totally nuts trying to create something new out of old parts			1
" bound believes that the philosophy of frugal innovation and the practice of repurposing technology could be applied globally			1
" frugal innovation coming out of @entity3 could have important implications for the rest of the world " says bound			1
" @entity157 has shown with its now famous ultra-low cost ecg machine that there is a @entity161 market for products born out of the constraints of the @entity3 healthcare market			1
it forces multinationals to think about how their existing investment intensive models of innovation can face inevitable growing competition with @entity3 and @entity170 multinationals			1
" of course , not all stories of frugal innovation have a happy ending			2
in 1975 , flooding across @entity3 brought the province of @entity175 to a standstill			1
the rising waters in the village of @entity179 made it impossible for many people to work , shop or go about their daily lives			0
local honey salesman , @entity184 , was forced to cross the swollen @entity186 river for sell honey , but every trip came at a price -- the boat was expensive and paying the levy was driving him towards penury -- so he came up with novel solution			2
@entity184 locked himself away for three days of solid design and construction			0
when he emerged he had constructed an amphibious bicycle , which would allow him to contend with the annual monsoon			2
it looked like a regular bike , but had large retractable floats attached to the sides of each wheel			0
@entity184 's invention earned him a raft of awards including the @entity207 's lifetime achievement award			2
yet in spite of the recognition , the inventor still lives in poverty			0
@entity56 says there is work to be done yet in connecting creative people with funding , and not all of it can come from the public purse			0
according to @entity56 , connecting grassroots technologists with big business will be key to development not just in @entity3 , but around the world			2
" nothing , " he says , " can justify preventing people from learning from one another			0

@entity3 inventors *recycle* old technology to solve local problems
inventions include amphibious bicycles , wind - powered irrigation systems and tree - climbing machines
frugal innovators around @entity3 have *patented* their inventions and received awards
