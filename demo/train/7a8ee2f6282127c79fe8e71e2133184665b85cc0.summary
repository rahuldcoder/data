at the height of his power , @entity0 controlled police forces , spy agencies , court systems and prosecution offices across @entity7 -- and the domestic security czar was n't shy in deploying his vast assets to crush dissent and unrest in the name of " preserving social stability			2
" during his reign before retiring in 2012 , as worsening income inequality and official corruption fueled mass discontent nationwide , @entity0 oversaw the domestic security budget swell to surpass that of the two million - strong @entity7 military -- the world 's largest			1
as a member of the ruling @entity24 's @entity23 -- @entity7 's top decision - making body -- @entity0 was one of nine men who effectively ruled the country of more than 1.3 billion people			1
away from the spotlight , though , @entity0 and his family members were reportedly taking advantage of his leadership position to accumulate enormous wealth			0
the allegedly blatant exchange between money and power , as revealed by @entity7 's state media , would eventually prompt @entity0 's shocking downfall last summer			2
after months of intense political rumors , the @entity24 's disciplinary arm in late july announced an official investigation into @entity0 for " serious disciplinary violations			1
" on friday , state prosecutors alleged the investigation found that @entity0 , 71 , had taken advantage of his positions to garner profits for others , and had " accepted huge bribes personally and through his family			0
" @entity0 was also expelled from the @entity24 , according to state news agency @entity51 , citing a decision made friday at a meeting of the party central committee 's political bureau			1
anti-corruption campaign many have viewed his fall from grace as a watershed moment in the secretive world of @entity7 politics now ruled by president @entity63 , who has been spearheading a massive anti-corruption campaign ostensibly targeting " tigers and flies " -- high - ranking and low - level officials -- alike			1
" the important thing here is that @entity63 has proven he 's powerful enough to break this taboo of never incriminating former @entity23 members , " said longtime political analyst @entity69 with @entity70			1
unlike @entity63 , who is " communist royalty " thanks to his father 's status as one of chairman @entity80 's comrades in arms during the revolution , @entity0 was born to a poor family in eastern @entity7			1
his father was an illiterate farmer but borrowed money to send him to school			0
smart and hardworking , @entity0 did n't disappoint and went on to become one of the few local students admitted into an elite university in @entity91			0
that school , now called @entity93 , was the cradle for titans in the state oil industry			0
after graduating with a degree in oil exploration , @entity0 was assigned to an oil field in the country 's northeast and rose through the official ranks from the late 1960s through the mid- 1980s			1
described by many as a capable and humbling young party cadre , @entity0 was remembered more for his political savviness than technical knowledge			2
his political skill shone when he was transferred to the oil ministry in @entity91 , which later became a giant state - owned oil company and one of @entity0 's power bases			1
decisive leader overcoming factional wars in the ministry , @entity0 was said to be a decisive leader who focused on expanding domestic oil exploration as well as overseas projects , a two - pronged strategy that would continue to this day			2
fast growth of business abroad made supervision from @entity91 harder , sowing the seeds for corruption			0
in 2001 , after a stint as minister of land resources , @entity0 was named the @entity24 chief of @entity127 in southwest @entity7 , one of the country 's most populous provinces			1
state media there portrayed @entity0 as an eloquent leader with a clear vision , and credited him for luring high - tech companies including @entity135 to the southwestern province , as well as modernizing the agriculture and tourism sectors			2
@entity0 also developed strong local ties and planted officials loyal to him -- including secretaries he brought from @entity91 -- in key postings throughout the province			0
@entity0 's big break came in 2002 when he returned to @entity91 and was put in charge of the ministry of public security , which runs the country 's police forces			2
five years later , he rose to the apex of power by taking a seat in the nine - member @entity23 -- with an expanded portfolio that covered all domestic security affairs			1
his reign coincided with a time of mounting social and ethnic unrest as well as such major events as the @entity159 in 2008 , the 60th anniversary of the @entity161 in 2009 and the @entity162 in @entity163 in 2010			0
ruthless hardliner as the leadership prioritized security and stability above all else , @entity0 greatly expanded police power at the expense of already - limited judicial independence , cementing his reputation as a ruthless hardliner among political dissidents and activists			1
it was also during this period that @entity0 became a patron of @entity178 , a fast - rising political star who was waging his own controversial war against organized crime in the southwestern metropolis of @entity182			1
@entity178 's spectacular downfall in 2012 -- complete with tales of murder , bribery and betrayal -- attracted global attention			2
state media cited his subsequent conviction on corruption charges as a prime example of @entity63 's resolve to clean up the party			1
@entity178 supporters , however , have long called him a political victim as the former high - flying politician was once considered @entity63 's main challenger for the top spot of @entity7 leadership			1
political activists and observers now note the similarity between the @entity178 and @entity0 cases			1
" @entity0 challenged @entity63 's authority and threatened his rule -- that 's why he 's now being held responsible along with his gangs , " offered @entity205 , one of @entity7 's leading political dissidents , who was thrown into prison for more than three years on " subversion " charges when @entity0 first took over nationwide law enforcement			1
" the bottom line is : all officials are corrupt , " he added			0
" @entity63 ca n't find a better excuse to rid of his political opponents than fighting corruption -- something that helps him win the masses ' hearts and minds			1
" the people being investigated for corruption are on the losing side of factional struggles , " echoed @entity69 , the @entity224 analyst			0
" people who are close to @entity63 are less liable to becoming incriminated			0
" @entity0 's family , aides probed those close to @entity0 have fallen with him			0
state media have reported official investigations -- and formal arrests in some cases -- into dozens of @entity0 's family members and former aides			1
the biggest impact was felt in the domestic security apparatus , state oil industry and @entity127 province -- three places @entity0 once ruled			0
details have also emerged in @entity7 media about possible skeletons in @entity0 's closet , including the suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of his first wife			0
most stories , though , have focused on the vast wealth amassed by @entity0 's older son as well as his two brothers and their families			0
the @entity255 reportedly benefited immensely from @entity7 's booming energy and real estate sectors thanks to @entity0 's deep ties to the two related ministries			0
@entity0 's older son , who is 42 , is said to own multiple luxury properties worth millions of dollars			0
before even turning 30 , the younger @entity0 's first foray into business met with fast growth and quick success after winning a contract to upgrade it systems for 8,000 gas stations across @entity7			2
his companies also reportedly reaped huge financial gain from buying and selling oil fields and hydropower stations			0
state media reports also indicated that one of @entity0 's younger brothers , a onetime farmer , used @entity0 's influence to launch a " crisis management " business and profited from helping people get out of jail , enter police academy and sell steel pipes to state - owned oil fields			2
other published articles have painted an intricate web of officials , cronies and tycoons -- some with alleged mafia connections -- orbiting around the domestic security czar before the crumbling of his power structure			0
" i think , unlike @entity178 , @entity0 will cooperate with investigators because his family is involved , " said analyst @entity69 , predicting a suspended death sentence for both @entity0 and his older son			2
" his only incentive now is to protect his son -- he will toe the line to protect his son			0

@entity0 arrested as part of corruption probe , expelled from @entity24
@entity0 was a member of the ruling @entity24 's @entity23
he 's the highest - ranking official to get caught up in president @entity63 's anti-corruption campaign
