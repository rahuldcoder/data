the faithful usher in the holiday , @entity6 , with joyous community prayers , acts of charity , visits from far - flung relatives , gift - giving and hearty greetings of " @entity14 , " or happy @entity6			1
this year , however , one controversy has cast a pall over the celebrations for many @entity1 : a @entity20 pastor 's threats to burn copies of the @entity1 holy book , the @entity22 , on the anniversary of the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			1
" although the joy of @entity6 is still there , the sense that we @entity1 belong in this society as equals seems to be under threat and there is a somber note in everybody 's preparations , " said @entity25 of @entity26 , @entity27			1
she said she will take her children to eid prayer services so they can feel a sense of community			2
" i want them to be proud of the fact that they are @entity1 and feel that they can practice their religion in their own country , without fear , " she said			1
@entity49 of @entity50 , @entity51 , is one of many who feel the holiday -- one of the most important in the @entity56 calendar -- has been hijacked by whether or not the rev. @entity57 , the head of a small church in @entity59 , @entity20 , will go ahead with his @entity22 burning plans			1
" he got what he wanted out of this			0
his 15 minutes of fame , " he said			0
" i will have more people at my place for @entity6 this year than this guy has congregants but yet he 's still dominating the headlines			1
" indeed , from @entity71 to @entity72 , the planned burning was on many @entity1 minds			1
in @entity72 , president @entity74 urged the @entity75 and @entity76 to act as he read a statement from the palace grounds on @entity6 day friday			1
" i am of course aware of the reported cancellation of the deplorable act by rev. @entity57			0
however , none of us can be complacent until such despicable idea can totally be extinguished , " he said			0
in @entity86 , sporadic demonstrations broke out friday , with the largest demonstration in the northern province of @entity89 where hundreds of @entity86 protested outside a @entity91 base			0
@entity91 officials said two people were hurt , but provincial authorities said one person was killed			0
the holiday bids goodbye to @entity97 -- a month of dawn - to - dusk abstinence from food , drinks and other sensual pleasures			1
@entity1 believe the @entity22 , the religion 's holy book , was revealed to @entity104 during @entity97 more than 1,400 years ago			1
@entity6 is one of two major holidays in @entity56 , alongside another called @entity107			2
the latter commemorates the prophet @entity110 's willingness to sacrifice his son for @entity112			0
the night before @entity6 , entire communities gather on rooftops , scanning the sky with giddy anticipation to see if they can see the crescent of a new moon			2
preparations for the feast begin as soon as it is sighted			0
in @entity124 's home in @entity125 , @entity86 , the menu includes rice , stew , kabobs and freshly baked @entity86 cookies			0
like @entity1 elsewhere , @entity124 and his family members don new clothes -- to symbolize a fresh start , he said			1
the fun continues on the second day with a uniquely @entity86 tradition : egg fights			0
men , armed with hard - boiled eggs , try to break each others '			2
the one whose egg cracks receives light - hearted ribbing			2
it is a joyous time when even the @entity146 cease fighting -- a rare respite in a war - ridden country , he said			2
" the day itself is , and has always been , about yummy foods , new outfits , " said @entity150 of @entity151			0
" this whole quran burning issue casts a negativeness on what should be a totally joyous occasion and i 'm annoyed at how dumb people can get			1
" but @entity160 , @entity161 , native @entity162 was n't going to let the controversy ruin her holiday			2
" i turned off the tv because i do n't want to hear about it anymore , " she said			0
" @entity6 should be about celebrating , house - hopping , stuffing our tummies and staying up late with friends			1
and that 's what i 'm going to do			0
" @entity0 's @entity174 in @entity175 , @entity86 , and @entity176 in @entity177 , @entity72 , contributed to this report .			0

@entity6 marks the end of @entity97 -- dawn - to - dusk abstinence from food and drinks
