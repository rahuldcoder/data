editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			0
@entity9 is @entity5 's site devoted to the overlap between culture and technology			0
the reports , which are being produced solely by @entity5 , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- from a quiet swath of @entity26 countryside , some one and a half hours outside of @entity27 , researchers are receiving radio messages from the farthest reaches of the universe			1
to do it , they 're relying on one of astronomy 's newest and largest gadgets -- the @entity36 radio telescope			1
the new , clever @entity38 and @entity39 - wide installation uses 15,000 low - tech receivers , supercomputer data processing and high - speed internet to form a mega-telescope capable of absorbing cosmic radio waves from the full sky at higher resolutions than ever before			0
when the @entity49 section of the telescope opened late last year , @entity47 attended the ribbon - cutting ceremony and met some of the scientists involved			0
for centuries , astronomy centered around what could be observed with our most wonderful and yet meager visual tool -- the eye			0
but in the last 50 years , the ability to receive radio waves , infrared and ultraviolet radiation , and x- and gamma rays -- all of them at different wavelengths than visible light -- has provided new and completely unexpected information about the nature and history of the universe			1
the resulting data and images from radio astronomy ( despite the " radio " part , you ca n't listen to these radio signals ) have yielded a cosmic zoo of strange and exotic objects , including radio galaxies , quasars , pulsars , masers , and cosmic microwave background radiation , which has provided compelling evidence for the @entity87			0
but we have yet to deeply explore the low radio frequencies , the lowest energy extreme of the spectrum accessible from @entity92			1
the wider the distance between the antennae , the higher the resolution of the " picture " that a radio telescope can make			1
hence the large footprint of most radio telescope projects , from the @entity102 - wavelength @entity100 in @entity103 to the @entity104 in @entity105			2
@entity106 is capable of producing even more accurate " images " than its predecessors			2
with more resolution than any other telescope , the 1500 km - wide @entity106 array is opening this frontier to a broad range of astrophysical studies , including transient sources , ultra high energy cosmic rays , cosmic magnetism , and the wonderfully - named @entity119 , when the first stars and black holes made the universe hot			1
this research will only accelerate over the next decades , as scientists build @entity106 's successor , the @entity126 ( @entity126 )			2
watch the rest of " the @entity128 on @entity92 " at @entity9 in the first research to emerge from @entity106 , to be published this month , scientists say that the telescope will lead to a tenfold leap in new discoveries of pulsars -- the peculiar stars whose highly - regular spin can be used as a kind of clock , and effectively , as a test of @entity141 's theory of general relativity			1
by observing pulsars as they beam toward @entity92 from different directions , astronomers are able to detect minute differences as the signals arrive , caused by the gravity waves that @entity141 predicted would distort space - time in different directions			2
if gravity waves are real , one of these " clocks " would seem to be running slowly			0
also announced this week by an international team of astronomers -- @entity106 has made the deepest wide - field images of the sky in the relatively unexplored part of the radio spectrum around 150 @entity160 to process data from across the network , the @entity162 telescope and the supercomputer in the @entity38 require an internet speed of 10 gigabits per second -- more than 1000 times faster than your typical home broadband speed			1
that 's just the kind of bandwidth you need when you 're downloading the far reaches of the cosmos .			2

@entity36 telescope , or @entity106 , is the largest telescope on @entity92
@entity106 allows researchers to receive radio messages from the farthest reaches of the universe
telescope 's superior resolution opens up broader range of astrophysical study
