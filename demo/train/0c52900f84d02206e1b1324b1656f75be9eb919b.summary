last week , i had the privilege to greet a group of about 100 @entity5 survivors who were meeting at the @entity7 chapel : the very structure that , seven months ago , was @entity9 's first @entity5 treatment unit			1
the group was diverse — elderly , young people , even little children			1
some educated , some not			2
roughly equal numbers of men and women ; some dressed up in nice clothes , some in t - shirts , shorts and flip - flops			2
some were clearly feeling happy just to have survived ebola , with smiles on their faces , while others looked like they were still experiencing some of the trauma and stigma of @entity5 : faces downcast , not making eye contact			1
as i met them , tears welled up in my eyes			2
these people had gotten through @entity5 just like i had , but here in @entity32 , where the resources , staff and treatment available were so much more limited			1
the gathering was initiated by the @entity37 of @entity32 , a local nongovernmental organization that has received funding to help @entity5 survivors			1
they were meeting with some of the survivors from the @entity42 in order to share a modest cash benefit , intended to help survivors rebuild their lives : replacing mattresses , clothes , furniture and phones , finding new employment , and trying to fit back into their communities			1
they also met with dr. @entity55 , another missionary doctor at @entity7			1
he let them know about a free survivors ' clinic at @entity7 to address complications of @entity5 , such as nerve damage or vision problems			1
on the national level , the @entity62 of @entity32 is well - organized , considering the brief time frame			1
it has a president , who presented me with his business card at the meeting			0
there are estimated to be about 1,500 @entity5 survivors in @entity32			1
in partnership with several international organizations , the association advocates for survivors ' mental and physical needs , and educates the public about @entity5 survivors to help reduce stigma			1
a few days earlier , i had met with another group of survivors : the @entity80 for @entity82			1
this was quite a different meeting			0
there were about 15 people there , many of whom i know well from having worked with them and treated them over the years since the program began in 2001			2
now that the @entity92 crisis is subsiding , they want to revitalize the group , which at times has had 80 to 100 people involved			2
in the past , @entity7 staff ran the support group and decided how to facilitate its activities , using funds from @entity99			0
but now these long - term clients — they are all on anti-retroviral therapy , some for years — want to become more independent , to be given more discretion to strategize and make decisions about how to use funding that is available			0
this was such an interesting and eye - opening discussion for me			0
early on , when we were just starting @entity7 's treatment program for @entity112 , many of these clients were quite ill , and needed nutritional support , medication and health care , and help with transportation to appointments and support group meetings			0
now the group has matured : many are very stable on their medication and really thriving			0
at this stage , they feel the need to be treated as equal partners rather than only recipients of charity			0
they want more input as to how the group might benefit from funds that come in			0
when a donation was made by @entity99 to the group about six weeks ago , they chose to make soap for laundry and dishes from locally sourced lye and palm oil , to sell it as a fundraising activity			0
the balls of soap sell for about 12 cents each			0
the group has sold most of the first batch , and they are projecting a profit of about 25 % over the cost of raw materials			0
they want to continue soap production , using the profits to help members of the group start businesses or attend college or other training programs			0
when i see the spark of initiative and determination in these people who were once so sick and discouraged with their condition , i get a new sense of what might be possible for them			2
what were the key ingredients in developing that spark ? our relationship started with unconditional love , and a real personal connection , as well as provision for some key practical needs , including sound medical care			2
and now it requires a readiness , and a means , to shift from charity to partnership			0
during the @entity5 crisis , we have seen that @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity32 , some of the least developed nations on the continent , did not have the capacity to fight the epidemic on their own			1
while the initial response to @entity5 required massive direct aid and assistance , let 's hope that we can also move on to real partnership in helping develop a locally led and driven health system that can do better at protecting its people from the next outbreak .			1

dr. @entity198 got to meet with fellow @entity5 survivors who are trying to put their lives back together
he has seen some amazing *resilience* among the people in @entity32 and some real *ingenuity*
