-- the combination of @entity3 's new storage service , @entity4 , and the company 's recently unified terms of service and privacy policy , have riled the internet into demanding to know why @entity3 seemed to be claiming ownership of their customers ' files			1
as it turns out , the company claims no ownership -- it says so right in the terms of service			1
and a comparison between @entity4 's terms and that of other storage services turns up few material differences , except for a couple of questionable terms that may land your content in @entity3 's promotional materials			1
in a comparison piece , @entity25 noted that the terms of service from four major cloud storage services -- @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , and @entity4 -- all claim no ownership of the files you give them			1
several publishing outfits raised the alarm about a clause in @entity3 's terms of service that states @entity3 reserves the right to " use , host , store , reproduce , modify , create derivative works ( such as those resulting from translations , adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with our services ) , communicate , publish , publicly perform , publicly display and distribute " content uploaded to their services			1
but as @entity25 pointed out , other services have similarly expansive , and sometimes more expansive , terms , and those services mean only to use them in service of , well , the services			0
when we spoke to the @entity64 about @entity4 's terms of service , the @entity64 found little about them that was more suspicious than in any other similar cloud service			2
but @entity69 , @entity64 's media relations director and digital rights analyst , paused over one phrase : " the rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating , promoting , and improving our services , and to develop new ones			0
" promoting ? @entity3 's unified privacy policy states that it wo n't use your material to do anything other than " provide , maintain , protect and improve [ its services ] , [ and ] to develop new ones , " and will ask for consent before lending your material to any other uses			2
but if a file is set as publicly available , that is considered consent for use to promote @entity3 's services			1
if a user uploads a photo and sets it as publicly viewable , that picture could end up in an ad for @entity3			0
the good news here is that @entity3 is n't going to be strewing your personal files all over the internet as banner ads , as the terms of service alone might suggest , provided the files have some privacy settings , as they do by default -- viewable only to friends , for instance			2
but a public file on any of @entity3 's services could , in theory , end up in promotional materials			1
it makes some sense that public content could be used by others , but it 's easy to forget how public " public " on an internet service is			0
it gives us flashbacks to the family photo posted on a blog that wound up in a @entity125 ad			0
@entity69 went on to point out that users should be more concerned with who @entity3 might be forced to give their files to , than what @entity3 itself might do with their files			0
" in light of @entity135 , it 's possible that users are worried about the wrong thing , " she said			0
files stored in the cloud can still be easily lost or subpoenaed without the users ' knowledge , @entity69 noted , an issue that 's often overlooked			0

users want to know why @entity4 seemed to be claiming ownership of customers ' files
as it turns out , the company claims no ownership -- it says so right in the terms of service
but a public file on any of @entity3 's services could , in theory , end up in promotional materials
