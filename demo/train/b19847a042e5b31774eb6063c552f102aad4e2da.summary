@entity0 -- do n't expect a chest bump on election night this year in @entity4			0
independent governor candidate @entity5 denied a close relationship between himself and the @entity8 incumbent , @entity7 , during their final debate tuesday night			1
" i would not suggest -- and i think he would agree , that we do n't have a bromance , " @entity5 told @entity1 's @entity11 while distancing himself from the man he high - fived and hugged during their first debate earlier this month			1
" four years ago ... we ended up with @entity7 as governor			2
we should n't make that mistake again			0
" @entity7 agreed there 's a lack of brotherly love between the two in a humorous moment during an hour - long debate , sponsored by @entity25 , @entity1 , and @entity26 , along with @entity28 candidate rep. @entity27			1
it 's a tight race between @entity7 and @entity27			1
@entity5 -- who has n't registered above 20 percent in most recent polls -- has caused ire among @entity31 , who think he 's splitting the @entity34 vote that would coalesce around @entity27 in a two - person race , ensuring a @entity28 victory			1
@entity7 , who does n't deny some benefits of the third party candidate , agrees @entity5 is taking away from a major party candidate 's smooth victory -- his own			1
" if it was @entity27 versus @entity7 , the election 's over , " he said about his own head - to - head strength against the six - term congressman			1
the candidates sparred that way as well , with @entity7 and @entity27 saving their harshest attacks for each other , letting @entity5 attack on topics he wanted or stay out of the ones he did n't			1
while talking broadly about infrastructure , health care , and taxes , @entity27 's attacks over @entity7 's attempts to cut some government programs prompted some of the unvarnished candor he 's earned a reputation for using when provoked			1
" i 've listened to all this rhetoric for about several months now ; i 'm tired of it , " @entity7 said			0
" this man does n't know what honesty is , and that 's all i can tell you			0
" @entity27 showed some grit in his own rebut about @entity7 's frankness			1
" what the governor says is anything , whether it 's factual or not , " he said			0
@entity5 struck right down the middle , ignoring the sparks and proposing to find a way to pay for @entity27 's proposals and avoid more of @entity7 's cuts			1
asked about the current @entity81 outbreak in @entity82 , @entity27 struck at the state 's preparedness , criticizing @entity7 for leaving two top infectious disease positions open at the @entity86			1
" the governor has failed us as far as keeping these positions vacant , " @entity27 said			2
@entity7 did n't take the bait and quickly turned to the work he 's done since the crisis began to prepare the state and respond to two suspected cases that did not test positive			2
" as your governor i 'm not going to be irresponsible and scare the @entity4 people , " he said			0
" i am assured by the doctors , and by the professionals at the hospitals , that we are as prepared as we can be			0
" on this , @entity5 agreed with @entity27 that the positions needed to be filled but made a sharp turn to health care reform , spending very little time on the topic of @entity81			2
@entity7 also stood by his comments from the previous night 's debate about people making a wage of $ 100,000 not qualifying as wealthy			2
" i do n't think it 's off - mark , i do n't think it 's wealthy , i really do n't , " @entity7 said			2
" i defy anybody to tell me if you 're making make $ 100,000 and you 've got two kids going to college , and you want to give to try to give them a good start in life , that that 's a lot of money			0
" @entity27 -- who prides himself as one who fights for the middle class -- pounced			0
" the fact that the governor said last night that $ 100,000 is not a lot of money -- it is a lot of money , " @entity27 said			0
" the governor does n't understand what hardworking men and women are going through here in the state of @entity4			0
" whoever wins will need appeal to @entity4 's love of bipartisanship , which has given @entity140 to the governor 's mansion twice and a current senate seat in @entity0			2
to do that though , perhaps a little more bromance is needed			0
@entity1 's chief congressional correspondent @entity11 contributed to this report			0
