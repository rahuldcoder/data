for @entity2 it is a new dynamic , experts say : demanding high value prisoners in exchange for hostages			1
three of the prisoners @entity2 apparently wants back are women -- a failed suicide bomber , an alleged bomb maker and a woman tied to the head of @entity2			1
the fourth is a child			0
many countries have a strategy of not negotiating with terrorists			2
but this new approach by @entity2 is putting governments to the test			1
in its most recent demand , @entity2 called for @entity22 to be handed over			1
she is a female jihadi imprisoned for her role in a 2005 suicide bombing at a wedding reception in @entity26 that killed dozens			0
if she was n't brought to the @entity30 border by sunset thursday , the militants said , two hostages would die : @entity34 journalist @entity33 and @entity26 pilot @entity35			1
the deadline has passed but the hostages ' fate is unknown			0
" by negotiating with @entity2 , by recognizing them , by even having dialogue with them , it gives them the impression of acting as a state , " said @entity39 , international security director at the @entity40			1
@entity26 officials have said they are willing to swap @entity49 for the pilot			0
but they have demanded " proof of life " to demonstrate that @entity52 , captured in december after his fighter jet crashed in @entity55 , is still alive			2
former @entity57 negotiator @entity56 said @entity26 was absolutely right to do so -- and that the failure of @entity2 so far to provide proof of life was suspicious			1
" it 's just a natural and ordinary course of bargains in these types of negotiations and they are choosing not to do that at this point , " he said			0
the latest proposal by @entity2 is not a prisoner exchange in the usual sense -- since the militants now want the release of @entity49 just in order not to kill the two hostages , rather than promising their release			1
@entity56 said entering into this kind of territory with terrorists was dangerous " if you engage in that sort of bargain then they can threaten to kill the same person over and over and over again -- and continue to demand release of hostages or whatever their demands are , " he said			2
" you ca n't give in to that sort of thing because then it puts you in an endless loop where they have all the power			0
" it 's important to remember that for @entity2 and groups like them , the key factor is gain , @entity56 said			1
" kidnappers are in a commodities exchange business			0
while it 's a horrifying concept to us , to them it 's business -- and it 's the business @entity2 is in and so you have to treat it like that			1
" besides failed suicide bomber @entity49 , @entity2 wants two other women -- an alleged bomb maker and a woman tied to the head of @entity2 -- and a child			2
each of the prisoners is symbolically and strategically important for the terror group			0
@entity114 is connected to @entity2 through her brother , once a ranking member of @entity116 in @entity117 , which spawned @entity2			2
in exchange for @entity121 journalists @entity119 and , later , @entity122 -- @entity2 demanded the release of @entity124 , nicknamed " @entity125 " -- an imprisoned neuroscientist in the @entity121 , linked to 9/11 mastermind @entity127			1
she was arrested in @entity129 in 2008 carrying bomb - making documents for a " mass casualty " chemical and biological weapons attack against @entity121 targets including the @entity134 and the @entity135			1
one high profile prisoner who @entity2 has not yet publicly demanded is @entity139			1
she may be the wife of shadowy - @entity2 leader @entity141 , who fought with @entity116 in @entity117 , though the @entity144 has disputed that			2
regional sources have told @entity3 that @entity147 is herself a powerful @entity2 figure , arrested as a high value target as she crossed into @entity151 with a four - year old child , whom one intelligence source identified as @entity155 's son			1
since their capture in march 2014 , @entity141 has been calling to get his child released , a regional source said			0
in the past , in similar cases , governments have budged			0
last year , the @entity121 traded several @entity163 captives for sergeant @entity164 , who was captured by the extremist group almost five years earlier			2
despite claims that @entity164 may have abandoned his post before being kidnapped , the @entity166 defended the move , saying it was nothing unusual			0
" it is consistent absolutely with what 's happened in previous wars -- including @entity178 , including @entity179 , " said @entity166 spokeswoman @entity171 , adding that there was " a long history in the @entity121 of prisoner swaps			1
" complicating the debate , one of the five @entity163 detainees released from @entity184 in return for @entity164 last may has attempted to return to militant activity from his current location in @entity188 by making contact with suspected @entity163 associates in @entity129 , multiple officials told @entity3 on thursday			0
during the @entity192 , the @entity191 also swapped hundreds of spies with communist bloc countries			0
but prisoner swaps with extremist groups remain controversial			1
in 2011 , @entity197 made a major made a major concession to its arch enemy , the @entity202 militant group @entity203 , which runs @entity204			2
it exchanged more than 1,000 @entity202 prisoners in return for the soldier @entity208 , who had been kidnapped in @entity204 in 2006			0
@entity203 celebrated the deal as a major victory and the government of prime minister @entity212 was heavily criticized			0
@entity213 , a @entity215 - based risk consultant , says swapping prisoners for hostages is still better than paying for release of prisoners , as some @entity221 countries do			1
" the payment of cash ransom can been seen as the direct funding of terrorist organizations and for that reason and a few others , is regarded as unacceptable certainly by the @entity121 , @entity215 and increasingly other nations , " he said			2
" there would be nothing unusual about the swapping of combatants and if the @entity34 victim is thrown in as part of the deal , then that is a great bonus			0
" it 's sadly far from certain that @entity33 and @entity52 will emerge from the current negotiations alive			0
but whether they gain the release of @entity49 or not , @entity2 ' leaders have very clearly achieved one goal : maximum media coverage for their cause			1
@entity3 's @entity243 and @entity244 contributed to this report .			0
