in a surprisingly warm stretch of october , the photographer shot an assignment in @entity15 , a neighborhood not terribly far from his apartment in @entity17			1
he could spend four days there but go home at night to see his wife and pet his cats			1
he knows the place well , too			0
he grew up in @entity24 and @entity25 and spent years shooting around @entity26			1
this stretch of @entity24 has changed since then , as all things do , but it 's still special , still a beloved place to dip a toe in the @entity30			1
it maintained its individuality , @entity0 says			1
it 's not like where he lives -- the same rent - stabilized apartment in @entity36 where he has stayed for decades			2
it changed around him into people who all seem to dress and act the same			2
" here , a guy gets a job on @entity42 , where 's the struggle ? " @entity0 said			1
" i 'm not interested , visually			0
" but @entity15 is something else			1
his wife loves to go there to swim , or buy tchotchkes and fancy mustard			0
if he had to pick a location for a fashion shoot , it 'd be there			0
the neighborhood was pretty @entity56 all those years ago			2
now , he says , it 's all @entity56			2
jewish and @entity60 , too , but really @entity56			0
he ca n't read the signs			0
you ask the time , and folks will show you their watch rather than say the words			0

he wandered the streets below the elevated train with a small @entity74 camera , and he snapped photos when he spotted a character			0
it 's not too crowded , and most people were very nice			1

" i shoot what 's interesting			2
all i 'm about is visual			0
" and @entity15 is a sight			1
for decades , @entity0 shot in black and white			1
for the last two years , he says , he sees in color			0
@entity15 has it all -- wild prints on shirts and dresses , fluorescent bathing suits that do n't exactly fit , garish makeup that 's been lovingly applied the same way for 50 years			1
" i shoot who i am , " @entity0 said			1
" and i shoot what interests me , even when people hire me			2
i 'll get the job done , but i have a lot of energy in my pictures			0
with those people , there 's a lot of energy			1
they 're shopping , shopping , shopping			0
they go with their carts , and their red lipstick and their bright clothes			0
" @entity15 ? sure , it 's close to home			1
but , @entity0 says , " it 's an assignment that i liked			1
