-- @entity2 travelers are now the top source of tourism cash in the world , according to a new report by the @entity7 ( @entity7 )			1
boosted by a rising @entity2 currency , @entity2 travelers spent a record us $ 102 billion on international tourism in 2012 , a 40 percent rise from us $ 73 billion in 2011			1
@entity2 tourism : the good , the bad , the backlash the results fall right in line with @entity2 's outbound tourism growth over the last 10 years			1
the @entity7 says the volume of international trips by @entity2 travelers grew from 10 million in 2000 to 83 million in 2012 , making it the world 's fastest - growing market			1
so what 's behind the increase ? the @entity7 credits rapid urbanization , rising disposable incomes and the relaxation of government restrictions on foreign travel			1
" in 2005 @entity2 ranked seventh in international tourism expenditure , and has since successively overtaken @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and the @entity33 , " says the report			1
" with the 2012 surge , @entity2 leaped to first place , surpassing both top spender @entity37 and second largest spender @entity39 ( both close to us $ 84 billion in 2012 )			1
" though the report did not break down spending per trip amongst international travelers , calculating total spend by number of trips suggests @entity2 travelers averaged a spend of $ 1,230 per trip			1
by 2015 , 100 million @entity2 will travel abroad , a benchmark originally forecast for 2020 , according to the @entity7			1
and now that @entity2 's @entity48 has crafted a landmark plan to kick start @entity2 outbound tourism even further , expect more phenomenal growth figures			1
it is dubbed the " @entity61 ( 2013 - 2020 ) " and is a roadmap for restructuring the current paid leave system across @entity2 with an aim to encourage governmental agencies , social organizations , enterprises and public institutions to promote the use of leave days			1
importantly , it also gives @entity2 workers more freedom and flexibility of where and when to travel			1
it 's all about shopping and what do @entity2 travelers prefer to do on their trips ? according to dr. @entity73 of @entity74 who specializes in @entity2 outbound tourism , unlike other global travelers , @entity2 tourists focus mainly on shopping			1
" it is the most prominent difference and more evidential in recent years , " says @entity73			0
" if you look at @entity2 tourists 10 years ago , they will mainly buy souvenirs			1
nowadays , they want to buy luxury products in @entity30 or @entity83 like handbags and watches			0
" dr. @entity86 , director of the @entity87 ( @entity88 ) , agrees , saying shopping is one of the main drivers for @entity2 tourists			1
" luxury goods are 20 - 30 % cheaper in other global cities			0
if you plan to spend us $ 10,000 on shopping and only spend us $ 1,000 on airfare , it 's much cheaper for @entity2 tourists to fly abroad to shop			1
" traveling is also a form of soft power , he adds , so it 's only natural for the @entity2 government to support its citizens to head abroad			1
" for @entity2 people the @entity39 is the only competitor left , " he says			2
" they have an interest in the model for capitalistic development and want to see what they can learn so they can overtake and become number one			0
" @entity2 are very proud of the fact that they are traveling , he adds , given the @entity116 is still fresh the minds of people over 40			2
" this happened all in one generation , " he says			0
" many have parents who did n't have shoes			0
all this growth happened so fast it 's still in living memory			0
" now they 're showing the world and themselves : ' i 'm strong , i can go spend us $ 5,000 for nothing , just my pleasure			0
' " other hot markets other emerging markets to increase tourism spending abroad over the past decade include @entity136 , which saw an increase of 32 percent in 2012 to us $ 43 billion , bringing it from seventh to fifth place in the international tourism spending rankings			1
" emerging economies continue to lead growth in tourism demand , " said @entity7 secretary - general @entity141 in a statement			0
" the impressive growth of tourism expenditure from @entity2 and @entity136 reflects the entry into the tourism market of a growing middle class from these countries , which will surely continue to change the map of world tourism			2
