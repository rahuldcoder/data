@entity1 , @entity0 -- the case of @entity5 athlete @entity4 has sparked worldwide interest following reports that she will be tested by sporting officials to determine whether she is male or female			1
@entity4 celebrates her gold , which came just hours after the @entity11 called for a gender test on the athlete			1
the 18 - year - old won gold in the 800 meters race wednesday but she may be forced to return the medal if she fails a gender - verification test imposed by the @entity11 ( @entity11 )			1
according to media reports , the @entity11 are testing to see whether @entity4 has a rare genetic disorder that means she has female genitalia but male chromosomes			1
this condition , known as intersex , is commonly referred to as hermaphroditism			1
( some support groups say that the term " hermaphroditism " can be inaccurate and offensive , as it implies that someone is both fully male and fully female , which is a physiologic impossibility			2
) according to the @entity32 , ( @entity32 ) intersex is a " general term used for a variety of conditions in which a person is born with a reproductive or sexual anatomy that does n't seem to fit the typical definitions of female or male			2
" " for example , a person might be born appearing to be female on the outside , but having mostly male - typical anatomy on the inside , " a statement on the society 's web site says			2
there are around 20 to 30 types of biological " intersex " conditions , each of them affecting the body in different ways			2
some people are born with both male and female reproductive organs , while others like intersex activist @entity60 are born biologically female yet possess masculine - looking genitalia			0
others have a form known as @entity63 ( @entity63 ) where the person is totally insensitive to any male hormones known as androgens			0
dr. @entity67 of the @entity69 's @entity68 told @entity2 : " @entity70 is incredibly rare , the one i 've seen most commonly and one which affects 1 in 13,000 people worldwide is @entity63			1
" " in a woman your androgen receptors leads you to grow pubic hair , for instance , " he explained			0
" if you are insensitive to androgens , you will grow up looking like a girl because the default of all human beings is female			0
" however if the body , when it 's developing , is not guided into turning into a male , then it will always be female , " he told @entity2			0
he added : " this @entity5 athlete could n't have @entity63 because her problem is that it is suggested that she looks rather male , she 's got a big jaw and has very little breast development , but so many athletes are like that , " he added			1
" but if she had @entity63 she would be all female and would n't have the advantage of the testosterone androgen , which make men 's bones grow and makes them faster than a woman			0
" to test @entity4 's gender , dr. @entity67 said the @entity11 test would involve her being examined by a gynecologist to see what her genitals look like			1
@entity4 would also have an ultrasound to see if she has all the normal female reproductive organs			1
doctors would also need an hormonal test to see if she had an excess of testosterone and they would also test her chromosomes			2
people who are intersex could also have the condition and not be aware of it , as was the case of @entity118 athlete @entity117 , who failed a gender test at the @entity120 and was stripped of her medal			1
she later attempted suicide , survived and recently announced she was becoming a coach			0
intersex conditions occur in one out of every 2,000 births in the @entity126 , according to the @entity127 , @entity128 - based @entity32			0
for more than half a century it was common for doctors to carry out reversal operations , either through castration or constructing a new vagina , on babies whose genitals were seen as either too big or too small			0
many of these people later spoke out and said that these surgeries caused them trauma and confusion in adult life			2
most groups campaigning for intersex people now advocate that doctors should not perform medically unnecessary genital surgeries on intersex babies to make them male or female			0
@entity2 's @entity147 contributed to this report			0

@entity5 athlete @entity4 will be gender tested after her gold medal win
the test will determine if she has a very rare condition known as intersexuality
there are various forms of the condition , which is very *complex*
most intersexuals go through life defining themselves as a *specific* gender
