@entity0 he ousted @entity4 's first democratically elected president in a coup , crushed political dissent , let foreign journalists languish in jail and just jabbed the @entity9 by greeting @entity10 as a hero			1
yet @entity4 's president @entity12 is fast becoming the favorite @entity14 strongman of @entity9 conservatives and @entity17 presidential hopefuls			1
@entity18 says he ca n't understand why the @entity19 has told @entity20 " you 're not on our team " as jihadism spreads like wildfire through the @entity14			2
@entity25 , another @entity17 2016 pretender has also praised him , and key conservative media figures are lionizing @entity20			1
the rush of affection for the former army chief contrasts with the strained relationship between @entity20 and the @entity19 , reflected in the @entity34 administration 's decision not to publicly back air strikes by @entity4 on a common enemy -- @entity37 -- in @entity38 this week			1
it 's also the latest manifestation of the decades - long tussle between the @entity9 and @entity4 , which pits a push for human rights and democracy against the yearning for a stable pro- @entity9 partner in a chaotic region , whatever the character of its regime			2
the spur for the conservative infatuation for @entity20 was a speech in january in which the @entity4 leader warned @entity53 was being " torn " and " destroyed " by extremism			1
" it 's inconceivable that the thinking that we hold most sacred should cause the entire @entity53 world to be a source of anxiety , danger , killing and destruction for the rest of the world , " said @entity20			1
@entity20 spoke in a highly symbolic venue , the @entity66 in @entity67 , one of the most vaulted seats of learning in the @entity53 world			1
" it 's antagonizing the entire world ! does this mean that 1.6 billion people ( @entity75 ) should want to kill the rest of the world 's inhabitants -- that is 7 billion -- so that they themselves may live ? impossible ! â€‹ " on the face of it , @entity20 's speech was a call to cleanse @entity53 of extremist thought and elements which groups like @entity37 and @entity88 have used to justify jihad			1
it continues to impress conservatives in the @entity9 amid a fierce political debate about how to contain @entity37 's march across the region			0
" he gave this incredible speech about @entity53 extremism , and saying it 's the responsibility of the @entity101 world to step up to fight this ; that the first risks are for countries like @entity4 , " @entity18 said in @entity95 on wednesday			1
it 's no coincidence that @entity17 are praising the speech 's blunt message at the same time as they are accusing president @entity34 of falling prey to political correctness in his unwillingness to state the @entity9 is at war with radical @entity53			1
that comparison is also frequently being made on conservative talk radio			0
@entity25 also praised @entity20 on @entity114 on wednesday			2
" what would be far better to see was the kind of courage that was demonstrated just a few weeks ago by president @entity12 in @entity67 , " @entity25 said			2
" why do n't we see the president of the @entity9 demonstrating that same courage , just to speak the truth , about the face of evil we are facing right now ? " @entity25 asked			0
@entity124 , another potential @entity17 presidential contender , said " thank @entity125 for president @entity12 in @entity4 " in an interview with @entity127			1
@entity129 leader @entity128 wrote in @entity130 that the @entity20 speech could be as historically resonant as @entity132 's " @entity136 " speech or president @entity134 's declaration : " @entity137			2
" conservative commentator @entity138 said on @entity139 last month that @entity20 may deserve the @entity140			2
but are @entity9 political figures ripping a speech redolent with @entity4 political overtones out of context to back up their own positions ? professor @entity146 of @entity147 said that @entity20 's remarks were not that unusual and that a number of @entity101 leaders have previously given similar speeches to limited effect			1
" it is standard stuff , " he said			0
and @entity20 's record toward political opponents and extremists , especially the @entity158 , which formed @entity4 's first democratic government until it was ousted by his army amid mass protests in 2013 , paints a different picture of the @entity4 leader			1
" the way that @entity20 represents dealing with them is not through abstract theological arguments but through a severe security and political response , " said @entity146 , who is also with the @entity165			2
" that is what he represents			0
that part of the message gets lost			0
" the @entity175 and rights groups fault @entity4 for the removal of a civilian government , using lethal force to disburse @entity158 protests , and for killing hundreds of protestors nationwide and say discrimination against @entity183 and @entity184 in @entity4 remains widespread			0
some analysts interpreted @entity20 's speech as a way to justify the exclusion from politics of @entity191 elements from political life in @entity4 following his landslide win in an election last year in which the @entity158 was banned			1
since the election , the @entity34 administration has tried to carefully restore ties with @entity4 on the grounds that it remains a vital strategic partner			2
secretary of state @entity203 visited @entity67 in september and @entity34 met @entity20 on the sidelines of the @entity205 in @entity206 last year			1
close intelligence cooperation continues behind the scenes			0
but relations have remained strained			0
after the coup the @entity9 temporarily held up a tranch of $ 500 million in military aid to @entity4 and an order of attack helicopters			0
reconciliation has been made more difficult by the detention in @entity4 of foreign journalists			0
the spectacle of @entity10 getting a warm welcome from @entity20 in a visit last week did not go unnoticed in @entity0 , and was an apparent sign from the @entity67 government that if the @entity9 does not take better care of its friends , @entity4 will look elsewhere			1
the @entity225 , meanwhile , said it was not even told in advance about @entity4 air strikes this week on @entity37 targets in @entity38 in revenge for the beheadings of 21 @entity4 @entity233 workers by an @entity37 - affiliated group			0
" it 's a complex relationship that we have with @entity4 , " said @entity225 spokesman @entity235			0
@entity37 's swift spread in the @entity101 world has some realists in @entity0 considering whether it 's time to re-emphasise the stability dimension of the @entity9 relationship with @entity67			2
@entity18 suggested as much on wednesday , in remarks that were especially noteworthy because the second term administration of his brother , @entity245 , angered the government of then @entity4 president @entity247 by issuing a call for democracy in the @entity101 world as part of its @entity251			0
@entity18 asked wednesday : " is ( @entity20 ) a little " l " liberal democrat that believes in freedom like we do ? " " no , he is n't			0
but i think we have to be practical , " @entity18 said in the first foreign policy speech of his putative presidential campaign which could augur another turn in the roller coaster @entity9 - @entity4 relationship			0
" we have to balance our belief in liberty with a belief that security and engagement will create the possibilities for the @entity4 to garner more freedom			0

@entity17 praise tough @entity4 line on radical @entity53
potential 2016 @entity17 *candidates* use @entity20 comments as *cudgel* against @entity34
comments mark latest twist in *diplomatic* dance between @entity0 and @entity67
