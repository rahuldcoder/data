-- most have likely heard the broad outlines of the events that led to former vice president @entity4 's heart transplant : five heart attacks , open heart surgery and a battery - operated heart pump			1
but few are probably aware that the 72 - year - old @entity4 believed at one point he would not live through the night and made funeral plans with his family			1
that 's just one of the surprising facts that i learned during an interview conducted over two days with the man widely considered to be one of the most powerful vice presidents in @entity20 history			2

he made plans for his burial with his family , and then had a heart pump placed			1
that heart pump stayed in his body for 20 months until he got a heart transplant at age 71			0
the @entity42 , a battery - operated heart pump , is basically used to buy people time -- a last resort , if you will -- while they await a new heart			0
@entity4 waited 20 months for a transplant , twice as long as the average wait for a patient for a new heart			1
for the entire time @entity4 was vice president , he had a secret letter of resignation pending			1
he wrote this letter because he saw a gap in the @entity20 @entity68			2

@entity4 unapologetic in documentary @entity4 said he gave the letter to his counsel , @entity78 , with instruction that it was to be delivered to president @entity80 if @entity4 were to become incapacitated			1
before @entity4 accepted @entity80 's offer to run as his vice president , he has said a team of doctors carried out a thorough evaluation of his heart			1
