-- @entity1 was driving home late at night after a trip out of town when it hit her			0
she had to share her story of surviving rape , to reach out and reassure other women who had been through the same traumatic experience that they were not alone			1
@entity10 asked people to send in their personal testimonies of surviving rape after the recent controversy over comments made by @entity17 congressman @entity16 , who said in an interview that women 's bodies could naturally prevent pregnancy in the case of " legitimate rape			1
" the request led to a flood of soul searching and often passionate responses from women such as @entity1 who have survived such an assault			1
@entity16 's ' legitimate rape ' comments trouble for republicans more than 40 people sent in stories from across the @entity17 and beyond			1
some had not spoken of what had happened to them , even to their own families ; others used the traumatic experience to go public to inform and reassure others			0
many were angry ; others were reflective over what had happened			0
some spoke of , inasmuch as it was possible , coming to terms with what they had survived , while for others , emotions were still as raw as the day they were assaulted			0
because some perceive negative connotations in the term " victim , " many of those affected , and the organizations and individuals who support them , prefer the term " survivor			1
" @entity60 , from @entity61 , was attacked as a freshman in college by a man who offered to walk her home from a party			0
she said @entity16 's comments harkened back to darker times when women 's rights were of little consequence			1
" do n't define to me what 's legitimate or not legitimate just because i did n't fight back , " she said			1
" these are attitudes that we should have left in the 1900s			0
" this year , the @entity76 revised its definition of rape to mean any kind of non-consensual penetration , no matter the gender of the attacker or victim			1
one woman who wished to remain anonymous finds the use of terminology such as " forcible rape , " when rape by its definition is forcible , particularly egregious			1
" i never went to the police			0
my friend told me later that the police would probably say that i deserved it because i was drunk and flirted with him at the bar that i should n't have been in because i was only 18 , " she said			0
" i still think she believes that i deserved it			0
" the question is , would my story be considered ' forcible ' rape ? i do n't think in ... @entity16 's case it would be			1
i think their definition is a woman being bruised , scared and bloody			0
" " sometimes , a woman has to do what she has to in order to protect herself , even if it means having sex with a man she did n't want to and even if she did n't yell to the top of her lungs about it			1
" opinion : what young men still do n't get about rape recovery from the trauma of rape or sexual assault can take years			1
talking about it and sharing the story of what happened is , understandably , something survivors are often unwilling to do			1
given the damage to a rape survivor 's psyche , not to mention the physical scars that can be inflicted , it is not hard to see why such stories remain unspoken for years			1
dr. @entity132 is a licensed psychologist and director of the @entity134 at @entity135 in @entity136			0
she sent in her passionate response to @entity16 's comments shortly after the controversy emerged , arguing that such comments invalidate victims , brand them liars and delegitimize their suffering , all of which greatly affects their attempts to come to terms with what happened to them			1
" it is 2012 , and we continue the legacy that seeks to invalidate victims , to call them in essence all liars , because if you are pregnant , you are not a legitimate survivor , " she said			2
" the silence , the lies and the ignorance must stop			0
" @entity10 : ' i was just a little kid ' when asked how they had coped with the trauma , many @entity162 said it was on a day to day basis			1
some mentioned thoughts of suicide ; many had had therapy			2
others looked to those to close to them for support			2
@entity175 , from @entity176 , who was assaulted as a child , credited her family and friends for support and assistance			1
" i am lucky , because my whole family has always stayed with me , " she said			2
" and also because i am surrounded by real men , my dad , my partner and friends , who are ' real ' men since they understand the suffering and continuously support me and stand on the woman 's side			1
" not all were so fortunate			0
" after i was assaulted , my own dad -- who was from the ' old school ' -- chastised me and said that i must have ' done something to ask for it , ' " said @entity191 from @entity192			0
" rape is wrong , period			2
men and politicians can try to quantify or qualify it , but only the victims know the true sting of the crime			2
" @entity191 became a chaplain to support those who had been the victims of such a crime and to offer the help she felt she was never given by her father			2
indeed , many survivors had converted their trauma into a chance to support others			1
@entity1 , the late - night driver , became a nurse			0
she recalled long nights in bustling emergency wards assisting vulnerable women who had been assaulted			2
" has ( @entity16 ) ever held the hand of someone who was either raped or the victim of incest ? " she asked			0
" seen the crumpled faces , the faces of those they love coming to the @entity222 ? given someone the morning - after pill and the counseling information , because it only takes one time to become pregnant , no matter the setting ? " @entity60 , the woman assaulted as a freshman in college , spoke of using her creativity to give shape to the emotions she often felt roiling inside her			0
through scrapbooking , painting and poetry , she felt she could exert some form of calm , of control over the emotions she experienced day to day			0
" take that pain and transmute it , turn it into art , dance it , sing it , paint it ... you can make something beautiful out of the trauma , and do n't ever let it define you , " she said			0
" i 'm a rape survivor but also a friend , a daughter , a mother , so much more			2
" have you survived rape or sexual assault and want to share your story ? send us your stories .			0
