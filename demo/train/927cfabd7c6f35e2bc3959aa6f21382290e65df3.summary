a federal appeals court allowed four states to prohibit same - sex unions -- a decision that could force the @entity5 @entity4 to take up the issue			1
in a 2 - 1 ruling thursday , the @entity7 reversed lower court rulings in @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 that struck down same - sex marriage bans			1
" when the courts do not let the people resolve new social issues like this one , they perpetuate the idea that the heroes in these change events are judges and lawyers , " judge @entity15 wrote in the ruling			1
" better in this instance , we think , to allow change through the customary political processes , in which the people , gay and straight alike , become the heroes of their own stories by meeting each other not as adversaries in a court system but as fellow citizens seeking to resolve a new social issue in a fair - minded way , " @entity26 wrote			1
the ruling @entity26 , who was appointed by president @entity43 , said that it 's not the responsibility of the judicial branch of government to make " such a fundamental change to such a fundamental social institution			1
" " process and structure matter greatly in @entity5 government , " @entity26 wrote			2
" our judicial commissions did not come with such a sweeping grant of authority , one that would allow just three of us — just two of us in truth — to make such a vital policy call for the thirty - two million citizens			2
" judge @entity59 joined @entity26 's decision , while senior circuit judge @entity61 dissented			2
" this is a very important decision from the federal court of appeals in @entity67 , which disagreed with every other circuit court that has decided this case so far , " said @entity63 senior legal analyst @entity62			2
" [ the court said ] there is not a constitutional right to same - sex marriage			2
" @entity61 said that @entity59 and @entity26 's decision read more like a piece of political philosophy than a court decision that grappled with a constitutional question			0
" instead of recognizing the plaintiffs as persons , suffering actual harm as a result of being denied the right to marry where they reside or the right to have their valid marriages recognized there , " @entity61 said , " my colleagues view the plaintiffs as social activists who have somehow stumbled into federal court			0
" ' they ca n't duck it anymore ' in october , the @entity4 announced it would not hear appeals to same - sex marriage cases filed by a handful of states -- effectively paving the way for same - sex unions to become legal in @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106			1
a handful of states later followed suit			0
the high court 's decision left the door open for future challenges -- such as one that could result from thursday 's decision			0
@entity118 judge overturns state 's ban on same - sex marriage many observers of the high court said they believed it did not take up same - sex marriage cases because there seemed to be a consensus on the issue on the circuit court level since the @entity4 struck down the federal law that defined marriage as between one man and one woman -- the @entity134			1
" [ the ruling ] sets up an almost - certain fight before the @entity4 , " @entity62 said			1
" they ca n't duck it anymore			0
" the @entity140 said it will appeal the appeals court 's decision to the high court			0
" we believe it 's wholly unconstitutional to deny same sex couples and their families access to the rights and respect that all other families receive , " @entity144 , staff attorney in the @entity145 , said in a statement			0
" we will be filing for @entity4 review right away and hope that through this deeply disappointing ruling we will be able to bring a uniform rule of equality to the entire country			1
" this ruling is the first by a federal appeals court to uphold a state 's same - sex marriage ban since @entity134			1
the @entity164 , a conservative organization , praised the decision			0
" the people of every state should remain free to affirm marriage as the union of a man and a woman in their laws , " @entity164 senior counsel @entity166 said in a statement			0
@entity175 expands federal recognition of same - sex marriage to 5 states			0
