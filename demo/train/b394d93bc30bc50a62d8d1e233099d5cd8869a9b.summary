-- though soccer is the most played sport around the world , with governing body @entity4 recognizing football federations in more than 200 nations , the beloved " beautiful game " has always struggled to be a dominant force in the @entity8			2
attempts have been made to boost its support , first with the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) which kicked off in 1968 , and more recently with @entity14 ( @entity14 )			1
the approach to break the grip of traditional sports in the @entity8 has been different with both franchises			2
the @entity13 , which collapsed in 1984 , favored big names and an adaptation of the rules , while the @entity14 has tried to supplement home - grown talent with foreign stars such as @entity24 , capable of taking the game 's reach to more fans			1
however , the @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 remain the big attention - grabbers with the @entity8 public as @entity33 , basketball and baseball dominate			2
though breaking this grip has proved a difficult task in most @entity14 expansions across @entity8 , @entity36 is one of the few towns where the tide for the affection of the city 's sports fans seems to be turning			1
@entity36 first put itself forward as an @entity14 franchise at the league 's inception in 1994 and , after several attempts , in 2007 the city was awarded a team thanks to the combined efforts of high - profile backers			1
film producer @entity53 , comedian @entity55 and @entity57 co-founder @entity56 , among others , combined to convince the @entity14 to accept the city 's bid and to create the @entity61			1
the bid was helped by @entity56 's ownership of the 60,000 capacity @entity64 , home ground to the @entity28 's @entity67 -- an arena built with intention of hosting an @entity14 team			1
@entity71 sports columnist @entity70 was amazed that it took so long to found a team in a community that has a large soccer fanbase			0
" @entity36 was a huge soccer market			1
it had a lot of success when the @entity13 was playing here in the 1970s and ' 80s			0
my question is : ' what took the @entity14 so long to get here ? ' i 've always thought that this was a goldmine			1
" " it 's the most played sport [ here ] , " adds @entity87 , co-president of the @entity88 ( @entity89 ) -- the @entity91 ' largest fan organization			1
" you can go around downtown @entity36 at every park and every pitch , and there are hundreds of teams playing			1
" the 2009 season was the inaugural campaign for the @entity91 , and while the front office will be delighted with its on - pitch performance -- the side reached the @entity105 semifinals and won the @entity106 -- it has been the enthusiastic response of the city 's soccer fans that could be providing most pleasure			1
@entity64 set a league record with an average attendance of 30,897			1
this rivals that of baseball 's @entity115 , who in 2008 averaged 28,761 at the 47,116 - capacity @entity118 and since 2004 have been watched by just over 30,000			0
while factors such as number of games must be considered , the @entity91 ' final playoff attendance of 35,807 indicates growing interest			1
yet it has been the nature of the city 's response that suggests this support is more than just a fad			0
" the atmosphere has been tremendous , " explains @entity91 coach @entity129			1
" every time we walked on the field the atmosphere was great			0
the fans were behind us and they 've got their chants for individual players			0
in that sense it 's very @entity140 , very international			0
" with their banners , flags and shirts , supporters have combined to create an atmosphere rare within professional @entity8 sports , and wholly typical of soccer			0
" a major problem with the atmosphere at typical @entity8 sports is the number of stoppages , there are too many times when tension is lost , " explains @entity148 , part of the @entity89			0
" in addition there are no sections in any baseball or american football stadium where active fans can group together , making it impossible for any organized support			0
" the process of attracting people inside and out of @entity36 's existing soccer fanbase has come at a time when the city is still reeling from the loss of its @entity29 franchise ( the @entity173 ) to @entity174 ( now named @entity174 )			1
despite its embracement of the @entity91 , the timing of the soccer season means it ends in november just as the @entity29 is getting underway			2
for some , the quality of the @entity14 is not enough to make up for the @entity173 ' disappearance			2
" i 've loved this year ; it 's been great to watch quality soccer , " @entity180 said			0
" but the @entity29 has the best players in the world , and they 're gone now from @entity36			2
the @entity14 has a good league , but these are n't obviously the best players in the world			2
for some people the gap has been filled , but not for me			0
" despite this there is a confidence that @entity14 in @entity36 is advancing well			1
" the @entity91 have done everything right to placate and involve the soccer fans , " @entity180 said			2
" but i think there 's still growth among sports fans			0
as the next couple of years progress , if the team gets better and i think because of management it will , then there 's a whole bigger market out there			0
" @entity129 is certainly optimistic over his club 's future			0
" we have to realize this was year one , so from a business standpoint we 've got to continue to work as it its year one all over again and not pretend it 's easy now			0
the main thing for us is we ca n't be complacent on the field or off it , " he said			0
the @entity91 will be absent from sunday 's @entity214 final , held at @entity64 , but @entity36 's soccer fans will surely echo @entity129 's sentiment			1
they will , however , be able to watch as @entity219 superstar @entity24 's @entity218 side takes on underdog @entity220			0

@entity36 was finally awarded a @entity14 franchise in 2007
the @entity91 *debuted* in the @entity14 in 2009 , winning the @entity106
the @entity36 franchise also reached the @entity105 semifinals
the @entity91 play at @entity64 , and had an average attendance of 30,897
