a top official at the @entity3 has resigned amid the growing scandal about wait times and care at veterans ' hospitals , the department 's leader said friday			2
news about the resignation of dr. @entity11 , undersecretary for health in the @entity3 , came one day after he spoke at a @entity14 hearing about the issue alongside secretary of veterans affairs @entity16			1
in a short statement , @entity16 announced that he accepted @entity11 's resignation			1
" as we know from the veteran community , most veterans are satisfied with the quality of their @entity24 health care , but we must do more to improve timely access to that care , " @entity16 said			1
" i am committed to strengthening veterans ' trust and confidence in their @entity24 healthcare system			2
" @entity11 was scheduled to retire sometime this year , the department said in 2013			2
the news of the resignation was met with derision by a leading veterans ' rights group , which said @entity11 's resignation does little to address the problem			1
" we do n't need the @entity24 to find a scapegoat ; we need an actual plan to restore a culture of accountability throughout the @entity24 , " according to a statement released by the @entity44			2
" to be clear , dr. @entity11 's resignation is not the step toward accountability that our members need to see from @entity24 leaders			1
anyone who has been following this situation knows that dr. @entity11 had already announced his retirement earlier this year			1
" the chairman of the @entity57 , @entity54 @entity53 of @entity55 , called the resignation as " the pinnacle of disingenuous doublespeak			0
" but president @entity61 supported @entity16 's decision to accept the resignation , according to a statement released by the @entity65			1
" as the president has said , @entity67 has a sacred trust with the men and women who have served our country in uniform and he is committed to doing all we can to ensure our veterans have access to timely , quality health care , " the statement said			0
the @entity65 reiterated the president 's previous order that @entity16 conduct a review of the @entity82 's practices at its facilities			2
@entity11 's resignation came a day after he testified before the @entity14 's @entity84 looking into reported delays at numerous @entity24 hospitals and a long list of serious problems and allegations of falsifying wait times , many of which were exposed and reported by @entity94			1
for six months , @entity94 has been reporting on delays in medical appointments suffered by veterans across the country and veterans who died or were seriously injured while waiting for appointments and care			0
the @entity24 requires its hospitals to provide care to patients in a timely manner , typically within 14 to 30 days			0
the most disturbing and striking problems emerged in @entity107 last month as inside sources revealed to @entity94 details of a secret waiting list for veterans at the @entity24			0
charges were leveled that at least 40 @entity67 veterans died in @entity24 while waiting for care at the @entity24 there , many of whom were placed on the secret list			0
but even as the @entity24 's problems have riveted the nation 's attention , numerous whistle - blowers from other @entity24 hospitals across the country have stepped forward			1
they described similar delays in care for veterans and also varying schemes by officials at those facilities to hide the delays -- in some cases even falsify records or efforts to " cook the books			0
" the secret waiting list in @entity24 was part of an elaborate scheme designed by @entity3 managers there who were trying to hide that 1,400 to 1,600 sick veterans were forced to wait months to see a doctor , according to a recently retired top @entity24 doctor and several high - level sources who spoke exclusively to @entity94			0
@entity24 officials denied any knowledge of a secret list , and said they never ordered any staff to hide waiting times			0
they acknowledged some veterans may have died waiting for care there , but they said they did not have knowledge about why those veterans may have died			0
the director of the @entity24 , @entity155 , was put on administrative leave by @entity16 two weeks ago , along with two of her top aides			2
but sources inside the @entity24 in @entity160 tell @entity94 the wait times and problems are still ongoing there			0
as a direct result of the allegations at the @entity24 , investigators from the @entity24 's inspector general 's office have gone to @entity160 and have been conducting an investigation there for months .			1
