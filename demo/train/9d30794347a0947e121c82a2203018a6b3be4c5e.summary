-- four years ago , @entity1 withdrew from consideration for @entity4 director because of his leadership role there while serious human rights violations were occurring , including waterboarding and secret detention			1
mr. @entity1 has said he regrets these practices			1
yet he moved from the @entity4 to the @entity11 , where he began to support a practice many consider worse than torture : targeted killing			1
@entity1 has been a champion and defender of attacks by @entity4 drones that have killed thousands of people , including hundreds of children , far from any battlefield			1
these killings have occurred in @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			2
defense secretary @entity25 has recently said the killing is likely to expand to @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			0
@entity25 , @entity1 and others in the @entity32 administration defended these lawless killings the same way the @entity36 administration justified the unlawful treatment of detainees			1
officials in both administrations have sought to win public support and overcome opposition by repeatedly asserting that what they are doing is effective and lawful			0
the tactical parallels are striking			0
to create an illusion of legality , both administrations coined new labels for unlawful practices			1
president @entity36 's people coined the term " enhanced interrogation methods " to describe torture , and are still asserting that waterboarding is not torture but an effective , necessary tool to keep the country safe			1
@entity1 unveiled the phrase " hot battlefield " in a speech at @entity61 in september 2011			1
a " hot battlefield " is the type found in traditional armed conflicts , where enemy fighters are killed without warning and it is permissible to also kill civilians , as long as their deaths are unintentional collateral damage and not disproportionate to the military objective			0
the @entity4 is killing civilians away from " hot battlefields , " but according to @entity1 , there are other types of battlefields that are not " hot " but nevertheless lawful places to intentionally kill targets and unintentionally those nearby			1
opinion : @entity80 is a friend to @entity81 the parallels between the two administrations do not end with fabricated terminology			0
lawyers in the @entity87 's @entity86 in both administrations have written secret memos apparently analyzing the legality of these troubling practices			1
after the memos were written , waterboarding continued during the @entity36 administration			2
president @entity32 finally ended it with an executive order signed within days of his first inauguration			2
@entity97 , however , stayed open , and targeted killing continued			2
we can safely assume that the memos conclude the @entity100 may lawfully carry out such practices			1
it is surprising to me that anyone feels the need to actually see these secret memos			0
international law clearly makes waterboarding , secret detention and targeted killing away from battlefields unlawful			2
the fact these practices have continued after the writing of the memos demonstrates the analysis is window dressing			2
the @entity116 and the @entity117 , among others , have committed significant resources to obtaining the memos on targeted killing			0
it would , of course , be interesting to compare the specious arguments and omissions that must characterize these memos with those released by the @entity36 administration on interrogation and detention			2
some citizens might actually need to see the memos to finally demand an end to the practice			0
the greater importance of the secret memos does not concern what they contain , but the fact our democratic government believes legal analysis can be secret -- that how the government understands the law that regulates its conduct need not be made public			0
the judge in a recent case who ruled the memos might lawfully remain secret has confused the facts of a particular case with the law			0
facts about particular operations can be kept secret , but not the law on which such operations are based			0
if the police seek a warrant , for example , in some cases the identity of a particular person sought under the warrant may be kept confidential			0
the law mandating the need for the warrant is public			0
game playing with the law does not amount to effective counter-terrorism strategy			0
@entity1 admitted as much in his @entity61 speech : " i 've developed a profound appreciation for the role that our values , especially the rule of law , play in keeping our country safe , " he said			1
" it 's an appreciation , of course , understood by president @entity32			1
... that is what i want to talk about this evening : how we have strengthened , and continue to strengthen , our national security by adhering to our values and our laws			0
" the @entity4 needs someone who will do what @entity1 says , not what he does			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			2

@entity185 : torture , *renditions* used during @entity1 's @entity36 era @entity4 tenure
at @entity32 @entity11 he backed something worse , she says : targeted drone killings
she says both @entity195 's misrepresented both practices , tried to keep legality obscure
writer : for @entity4 chief , @entity100 needs someone who upholds nation 's values . @entity1 has not
