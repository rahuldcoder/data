@entity0 , @entity1 -- the discovery of the exact location of a stockade and dozens of personal artifacts belonging to its @entity8 prisoners is one of the biggest archaeological @entity10 finds in decades , federal and @entity1 officials said monday			1
outside of scholars and @entity10 buffs , few people have heard of the @entity16 's @entity15 , which replaced the infamous and overcrowded @entity17 in fall 1864			1
for nearly 150 years , its exact location was not known , the @entity18 , the @entity19 and @entity20 said			0
@entity20 students earlier this year began their search at a state park and federal fish hatchery for evidence of the wall timbers and interior buildings			0
" archaeologists call it one of the most significant @entity10 discoveries in decades , " a joint statement read			1
officials would provide no details until the formal announcement wednesday morning at @entity15 , five miles north of @entity36 in southeast @entity1			1
an open house for the public will follow from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. life at @entity15 , described as " foul and fetid , " was n't much better than at @entity17 , with the exception of plentiful water from @entity15			1
in its six weeks ' existence , between 725 and 1,330 men died at the prison camp			1
the 42 - acre stockade held about 10,000 men before it was hastily closed when @entity8 forces approached			0
monday 's announcement follows weeks of speculation that began after a locked chain - linked fence went up around the hatchery adjoining the state park			1
townspeople in nearby @entity36 made the secrecy part of their water cooler discussions			0
" it 's created a lot of buzz , what 's going on out there , " said @entity59 , owner of @entity60 , a popular meeting place in the town of about 3,500			1
rumors have included the discovery of a chest with important papers , gold , a burial trench and , yes , even @entity8 gen. @entity75 's horse			2
there are no photos of @entity78 and few visual stockade details , although a @entity8 mapmaker painted some important watercolors of the prison			2
he also kept a 5,000 - page journal that detailed the misery at @entity15 , which was built to hold up to 40,000 prisoners			2
" the weather has been rainy and cold at nights , " pvt. @entity87 , who was previously imprisoned at @entity17 , wrote in his diary on nov. 1 , 1864			0
" many prisoners have died from exposure , as not more than half of us have any shelter but a blanket propped upon sticks			2
. our rations have grown smaller in bulk too , and we have the same hunger as of old			0
" the impending arrival of @entity103 forces during @entity104 soon forced the @entity105 to move the prisoners elsewhere , including @entity107 , @entity108 , and @entity109 , @entity1			2
in early december 1864 , @entity8 cavalry found the empty prison , a freshly dug area and a board reading " 650 buried here			2
" outraged , troops apparently burned much of the stockade and the camp buildings , and a depot and a hotel in @entity36 , which was a transportation hub			2
many of the state park facilities -- including a pool , houses and the main office -- sit atop the prison site			1
some earthworks , long known to visitors and historians , survived			0
the artifacts will deepen the knowledge of the tough daily life of prisoners and guards alike , said a historian who has completed a manuscript on the camp			1
" [ @entity78 ] illustrates almost every @entity142 issue , " said @entity136 , professor emeritus at @entity137 which has campuses in nearby @entity139 and @entity140			0
@entity136 cited health conditions , death rates , prisoner exchanges and the @entity108 's dwindling ability to manage a population where disease and poor sanitation were in abundance			0
until now , @entity17 was the sole pow camp in the @entity108 to capture the public 's attention and imagination			1
besides the camp 's own horrors , @entity155 made @entity17 famous through her extensive campaign to have pow graves found and soldiers reinterred at a national cemetery			1
the prison 's commandant , @entity162 , was hanged in 1865 , the only man to be hanged for war crimes during the @entity10			1
monuments dot @entity17 , which drew 136,000 visitors last year			0
a 1996 movie tells its story			0
none of that happened at @entity15 , where time and its remote location put it on the road to obscurity , fortunately for archaeologists			0
that promises to change beginning wednesday , when the public will get its first glimpse of what life might have been like for prisoners , many of whom had been moved to @entity15 from @entity17			1
@entity187 and @entity188 , owner of @entity189 , hope anything associated with the discovery will boost the depressed area , where a 10.7 percent unemployment rate exceeds the state average			0
" our county [ @entity197 ] needs something to revitalize @entity36 , " @entity187 said .			0

new : @entity200 will expand knowledge of prisoners ' daily life
