-- we love @entity3 films for so many reasons : the handsome men and beautiful women , the cool gadgets and outrageous villains , the amazing chases and death - defying stunts			1
and , of course , the travel tips			1
film after film , no one has given us more inspiration to travel the world than @entity3			1
" we are always looking to offer the audience the ' wow ' experience of something amazing and different , " said @entity19 , executive producer of the upcoming " @entity20 , " the 23rd film in the @entity3 franchise			1
" i think everyone who goes to see a @entity3 movie expects to be impressed by the look and the locations chosen			1
certainly i was when i grew up watching them , and i do n't think that 's changed in the last 50 years			2
" there are two reasons to celebrate mr. @entity3 in style : @entity36 @entity35 was october 5 , commemorating the 50th anniversary of the theatrical release of " @entity39 , " starring @entity40 as @entity41			1
and november 9 is the @entity43 premiere of " @entity20 , " starring the latest @entity3 , @entity44			1
in celebration of all things @entity3 , we give you ( 00 ) 7 destinations where you can experience the world @entity3 - style			1
religious conversions : renovated monastery hotels and more @entity53 several locations in @entity53 are featured in " @entity20			2
" " it is where @entity56 , and the colors and vibrancy of @entity60 provided us with a great backdrop and such amazing locations as the @entity64 , " @entity19 said			1
@entity60 's @entity64 has been a must - see since 1461			2
more than 550 years later , it attracts nearly a half - million visitors daily			2
presumably few of them other than " @entity20 " director @entity68 envision its narrow , crowded aisles as a location for a high - speed chase			2
it is , however , an excellent place to purchase local handicrafts and to engage all your senses as you immerse yourself in the city			2
railway scenes for " @entity20 " were shot on and around @entity80 's dizzying @entity79 in southern @entity53 , and beach scenes -- including one that was meant to be in the @entity83 -- were shot near @entity84 on the @entity86 coast			2
" @entity53 actually allowed us to combine our needs of four different looks in one country , quite remarkable , " @entity19 added			2
7 ways to go local while traveling @entity92 , @entity93 " @entity101 " ( 1989 ) kicks off with @entity94 as @entity3 , parachuting in with his @entity96 pal @entity95 ( @entity97 ) to @entity95 's wedding at @entity99 in @entity92 after some insane aerial maneuvers			1
other scenes shot in the area include a car chase on @entity105 , the segmented concrete ( to make it hurricane - resistant ) span you 'll cross if you 're driving to @entity92 , and a scene at the @entity109 in which m ( @entity110 ) demands that @entity3 relinquish his " license to kill			1
" @entity114 , also no slouch in the adventure department , moved to the 907 whitehead st. house in 1931			2
a guided tour shows you his writing studio and introduces you to the descendants of @entity114 's famous six - toed cats , who have unlimited license to roam the house and grounds			2
the @entity125 of @entity3 's many visits to the @entity125 , the most memorable is @entity40 's 1965 " @entity130 " battle in the underwater caves of the @entity129			1
they 've been known ever since as the @entity132			0
( @entity133 returned there in 1983 for " @entity135			0
" ) several charter companies , including @entity137 and the @entity138 , will take you out to the grotto by boat and guide you on a snorkeling route to the inside of the caves , where light seems to stream in directly from heaven and colorful fish dart about below the water 's surface			0
some tours also include a visit to the nearby @entity152 and a stop at the @entity154 , where you can dine or spend the night			0
@entity156 with an " i 'm too old for this stuff " look on his face , @entity159 as @entity3 chased @entity161 as @entity162 up the steps of the @entity164 in " @entity165 " ( 1985 ) , only to watch her parachute off the top in one of the film 's more memorable scenes			1
( it was almost as unforgettable as @entity173 's video for the film 's theme song			1
) on a tour of the tower , you 'll learn about @entity180 's tragic demonstration of his " parachute suit " in 1912 , which should convince you that parachuting is not the thing to do here			0
however , if you 're feeling fit , you can climb the 704 steps from the ground to the second floor			0
from there , you can catch the lift to the top , where you 'll find a @entity192 bar with killer views of its own			0
@entity195 , @entity196 " @entity205 " ( 1969 ) took us to the mountaintop : the 2,970 - meter - high @entity195 in @entity196 's @entity199 , which @entity200 as @entity3 skied down at breathtaking speed , with @entity202 as @entity203 in pursuit			1
it 's one of the great movie ski chase scenes , now documented in an exhibit at @entity209 , the world 's first revolving restaurant , which doubled as the @entity212 in the film			1
organized @entity3 - themed excursions that include a @entity3 breakfast at @entity209 start from the car - free town of @entity218 , or you can glide up the mountain yourself on a 32 - minute aerial cable car trip that originates in @entity223			1
for more @entity3 - style adventure , ski the mountain 's 15.8 km mixed - terrain inferno course			1
experienced skiers usually cover it in about 45 minutes ; competitors in the annual @entity230 -- the largest amateur ski race in the world -- can do it in 15			0
@entity234 , @entity235 the @entity3 producers were so impressed by the 2007 production of @entity239 at the open - air @entity241 floating stage on @entity242 ( or @entity242 ) , they knew they had to work it into a film			1
that 's why in " @entity246 " ( 2008 ) , @entity44 finds himself chasing bad guys under the startling open - eye backdrop of the " @entity239 " set designed by @entity250			0
the annual @entity253 , approaching its 67th season , are only slightly less exciting			0
the next opera on the @entity242 will be @entity256 's " @entity255 , " which opens july 17 and runs through the summer			0
@entity234 itself , in western @entity235 , is known for its contemporary architecture , such as the @entity260 concert hall adjacent to the floating stage			0
guided tours of both are conducted year - round			0
@entity264 , @entity265 " nobody does it better " than the opening sequence of " @entity269 " ( 1977 ) , in which @entity270 jumps off the edge of a mountain and ... whoosh ! a @entity275 parachute opens and wafts him to safety			0
" no effects , all done in camera for real , " @entity19 points out			0
( @entity280 is an acronym for @entity282 , @entity283 , spans and @entity285 , the four things you can jump from			0
) the mountain , with its distinctive twin flat - topped peaks at 6,598 feet , is @entity290 in @entity264 on @entity291 , @entity265			0
serious outdoors people find the 7,370 - square - mile arctic park a haven of pristine beauty offering 24 - hour daylight in summer			0
accessible via the @entity299 hamlets of @entity300 and @entity301 , which can be reached only by small plane , the park requires that all visitors attend a safety orientation before they embark on their travels			0
for this level of adventure , only experienced wilderness travelers -- and @entity310 agents -- need apply .			0

no film series has provided more travel inspiration than @entity3
his *cinematic* stops have included the @entity125 , @entity156 and @entity196 mountains
" we are always looking to offer the audience the ' wow ' experience , " producers said .
