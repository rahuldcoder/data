the intricate design etched into a field of barley two hours south of @entity3 was spotted monday morning by @entity4 , a photographer , as she and her husband were flying over			1
" what is it ? " was her first thought , she told @entity10 affiliate @entity9			2
whatever it was , " it was beautiful , quite beautiful , " she said , adding that they came upon it by chance but that she was skeptical that the crop circle was evidence of something otherworldly			1
" i believe it 's possible that aliens exist , but i do n't know if they would bother making a crop circle to give us a message , " she said			1
still , the news spread quickly			0
the field 's owner , @entity24 , had just returned from vacation to his home when he got a call from one of the employees on his 2,000 - acre farm outside the tiny town of @entity33 , 10 miles southeast of @entity34			1
" he said , ' hey , there 's a buncha stuff out in the middle of the field , ' so when i went up there i go , ' ohhhh , shoot ! ' , " the 58 - year - old farmer told @entity10 tuesday in a telephone interview			1
what he saw was an elaborate design sculpted into one to two acres of his barley field : a crop circle -- more precisely , a lot of squares and rectangles within a large circle			1
" to me , it looks like a computer chip , or something like that , " said @entity24 , who added that he had no idea what may have caused it			0
" to be that intricate in design , it kind of baffles me as to how that was done , " he said about the flattened grassland			0
" it did n't look burned to me , it just looked like it was pushed over			0
" soon , the news vans showed up , followed by the curious , some of whom stood on fences to get a better view			2
@entity24 called security agents to keep people from crossing onto his farmland , where he also grows broccoli , snap peas and lettuce			2
" it 's a food - safety issue , " he said			0
that has n't stopped the roadsides from filling with the curious , many of them self - appointed experts			2
" it looks like aliens to me , " @entity77 of nearby @entity78 told @entity9			0
" @entity85 , " said @entity81 of @entity33 , who added , " this is kind of a strange place to have anything out of the ordinary happen			1
" the latter theory got some support from @entity88 , who told @entity9 that he had seen 20 to 30 people with ladders in the field in the days before the design was discovered			1
and @entity93 said he too had seen evidence that humans were involved			0
" every time i drove by , i saw them either parked over there , " he said , pointing , " or people in the field just walking around , and it looked like they had little @entity101 or something , " he said			1
and someone identified solely as " can not say " posted a 2Â½ - minute video on @entity105 that shows green flashes of light emanating from what appears to be the field before dawn on monday			2
" dude , this is a crop circle , " says one of two men in the video as they clamber from their car into the field			1
the founding publisher of @entity116 was unimpressed			0
" it looks like a couple of kids did this , " @entity117 told @entity10			0
" short of having a video of it , it 's hard to prove that kids did it			0
so , in that case , we have to make a choice : what 's more likely ? that aliens landed in @entity33 , @entity133 , or that a couple of pranksters made it ? " we have zero evidence of aliens landing anywhere ; we have lots of evidence of pranksters hoaxing			1
" such circles can be made by simply dragging a rope attached to a board over the grass , he said			0
still , he noted , such stories are attractive to many			0
" people seem less intrigued by pranksters than they do by aliens , so it 's a compelling story for people to think that we 're not alone			2
" farmer @entity24 said he was out of town during the week before the discovery , so he saw nothing that might have tipped him off that pranksters were at work			0
but whoever -- or whatever -- caused the circle has caused him no lasting upheaval -- financial or otherwise			2
the barley was planted between cash crops to add nutrients to the fields ; he is planning to plow it -- and the crop circle -- back into the earth on thursday .			1

" it was beautiful , " says photographer @entity4 , who spotted crop circle
the curious line the road outside @entity33 , @entity133 , to get a *glimpse*
one witness says he saw 20 to 30 people with ladders in the field days before
@entity182 says it was not a cash crop and he already planned to plow it under
