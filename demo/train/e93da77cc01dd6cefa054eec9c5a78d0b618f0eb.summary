-- if talking tough on @entity2 were an @entity4 sport , @entity1 would win a gold medal after his trip to @entity7 this week			1
" we have a solemn duty and a moral imperative to deny @entity2 's leaders the means to follow through on their malevolent intentions , " the presumptive @entity9 nominee told a staunchly conservative crowd in @entity11 , vowing that " no option should be excluded " in preventing @entity2 from getting a nuclear weapon			1
@entity1 's top @entity20 adviser , @entity19 -- formerly @entity21 's spokesman in @entity22 -- also turned a few heads when he appeared to say that a president @entity1 would give the green light for an @entity7 attack on @entity2			1
opinion : @entity1 walks a wary line in @entity11 noting that the @entity30 should " do everything we can " to prevent the @entity32 republic from getting a nuclear capability , @entity19 then went further			2
" and if @entity7 has to take action on its own , in order to stop @entity2 from developing that capability , the governor would respect that decision , " he said			1
that would represent a real departure from the last two @entity30 presidents ' policy of seeking to dissuade @entity7 from taking matters into its own hands , a dangerous move that could set the @entity20 ablaze			2
was the former @entity49 governor signaling a new approach ? evidently not			0
given an opportunity to repeat @entity19 's comments , @entity1 declined -- and his campaign also issued a clarification : " gov. @entity1 believes we should employ any and all measures to dissuade the @entity2 regime from its nuclear course , and it is his fervent hope that diplomatic and economic measures will do so			1
in the final analysis , of course , no option should be excluded			0
gov. @entity1 recognizes @entity7 's right to defend itself , and that it is right for @entity30 to stand with it			1
" politics : in @entity69 , @entity1 heralds economic freedom if that sounds an awful lot like @entity75 's position , it 's because it is @entity75 's position			1
as he put it in an interview with the @entity91 's @entity90 earlier this year , " ( @entity92 ) ltimately , the @entity7 prime minister and the defense minister and others in the government have to make their decisions about what they think is best for @entity7 's security , and i do n't presume to tell them what is best for them			2
" @entity1 argues that @entity2 leaders do n't take @entity75 's refrain that " all options are on the table " seriously , a situation he apparently believes would change if @entity30 elected a new president			1
maybe so -- @entity2 did blanch at first in the face of military threat when the @entity30 forcibly ousted @entity101 in @entity22 , and withdrew its threat to close the @entity103 when confronted by stern warnings from top @entity30 defense officials			0
but @entity75 's rhetoric has been , if more carefully calibrated , just as firm as @entity1 's			1
in that same interview with @entity90 , the president pointedly mentioned the military option , and said , " as president of the @entity30 , i do n't bluff			0
" politics : @entity1 aide loses cool , curses at press in @entity69 @entity116 reporters and policy wonks have been playing the " will they or wo n't they ? " game on @entity2 for years			1
and until recently , the consensus was that @entity7 and the @entity30 were , in fact , bluffing -- that to get other big powers to go along with tougher sanctions , they had to persuade them that they might indeed attack			2
but now , that consensus seems to be shifting as @entity2 nears what @entity7 defense minister @entity128 calls the " zone of immunity " -- when @entity2 has enough enrichment capability buried safely beyond the reach of @entity7 bombs that its program will be impossible for the jewish state to stop on its own			2
@entity30 military leaders have hinted that the @entity30 has a bit more time ; @entity30 b - 52s and massive bunker - busters can still do the job if it looks like @entity2 really is about to get the bomb			0
and given that the @entity148 , for all its doubts about @entity2 's intentions , has never conclusively determined that @entity2 wants the weapon , it may be years before we reach that point , if ever			2
politics : @entity153 protest @entity1 statements as ' racist ' still , diplomacy and sanctions have yet to show that they can change the calculus of @entity2 's leaders			1
the @entity32 republic has been isolated from the world economy for three decades			0
it suffered through a devastating war with @entity22 in which it sent unarmed children barefoot across landmines			0
this is not a country that buckles easily under pressure			0
and at this point , given how politicized this showdown has become , it 's hard to imagine a deal that both sides can accept			0
here , again , the differences between @entity1 and @entity75 do n't really matter -- @entity1 has ruled out any enrichment whatsoever , while @entity75 will accept some -- because neither is good enough to pass muster in @entity178			1
the last hope for peace may be a kind of tacit agreement : @entity2 does not cross any red lines , and we do not bomb			0
in other words , a lot like the tenuous arrangement we have now			0
but how long can it last ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			0

@entity191 : @entity1 talks tough about @entity2 , nuclear weapons on his @entity7 trip
@entity191 : adviser seemed to say a president @entity1 would ok @entity7 to attack on @entity2
he says @entity1 backed away from remark , reiterated position that is much like @entity75 's
*writer* : likely both candidates will accept current standoff , with *intransigent* @entity2
