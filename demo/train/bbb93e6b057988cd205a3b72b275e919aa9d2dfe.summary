-- saying that " the darkest corners of the @entity6 " pose a real threat to children , @entity2 prime minister @entity1 on monday rolled out a plan that would , by default , block pornography on most computers , smartphones and tablets			1
@entity2 wireless and @entity6 providers have agreed to put adult - content filters on phones , public @entity18 networks and home computers in the coming months			1
by the end of the year , the filters will become the default setting for anyone setting up broadband internet service at home , @entity1 said			1
" i 'm not making this speech because i want to ( moralize ) or scare - monger , but because i feel profoundly as a politician , and as a father , that the time for action has come , " @entity1 said			2
" this is , quite simply , about how we protect our children and their innocence			0
" all of those filters could be deactivated by those who can " prove " they are 18 or older , @entity1 said			1
the plan is the result of a monthslong effort by @entity1 to restrict access to internet porn			1
he has called @entity43 and other search companies into meetings , demanding they do more to hide porn from children , and appointed @entity49 member @entity48 as a special adviser targeting the issues			0
the plan will require no action from @entity49 because service providers and other web companies are participating voluntarily			1
some already provide service with porn filters as their default settings			1
not surprisingly , web freedom advocates and other critics were quick to decry the plan			2
for one , many say effective web filters simply do n't exist			1
" as a technological feat , it would be utterly impossible , " columnist @entity64 wrote in the @entity65 , a nationwide tabloid frequently critical of @entity1 's @entity66			2
" his porn shield speech today , and the proposals that are in it are the deranged ravings of someone who has decided that something must be done , has decided what it is , but does n't ( realize ) that it is n't actually feasible			2
he 's got just as much chance of banning ( gray ) clouds while giving us all access to the nice white , fluffy ones			2
" critics say that automated filtering technology inevitably allows offensive material through accidentally as well as creating " false positives " that block inoffensive content			0
others , such as @entity89 technology correspondent @entity88 , say default - on filters can create a false sense of security among parents , who could become more lax in monitoring their children 's online behavior			2
the internet service providers that have signed off on the plan provide service to roughly nine out of 10 households in @entity101			1
in his speech , @entity1 cited a two - pronged problem : the online exploitation of children through child pornography and the easy access children have to otherwise legal pornography at an early age			1
" in one we 're talking about illegal material , the other legal material that is being viewed by those who are underage , " he said			0
" but both these challenges have something in common			0
they are about how our collective lack of action on the @entity6 has led to harmful -- and in some cases truly dreadful -- consequences for children			0
" the prime minister announced an effort to expand and streamline currently fragmented child - porn databases and a new interpretation of law that will make porn depicting rape illegal			1
he also announced a new " @entity134 " label that will allow hotels , restaurants and other businesses to advertise that the web access they provide has porn filters enabled			1
two recent @entity2 murder trials in which the defendants were each said to have viewed images of child sexual abuse online have heightened public concern over the issue			0
one case was that of @entity142 , a 5 - year - old girl whose disappearance last year in a remote part of @entity146 sparked a huge search			0
@entity142 was found guilty of her murder in may , but her body has still not been found			0
the other was the murder of a 12 - year - old girl , @entity154 , by her grandmother 's partner			0
@entity1 said he had met with the parents of those two girls on friday			0
" protecting the most vulnerable in our society , protecting innocence , protecting childhood itself -- that is what is at stake , " @entity1 said			0
" and i will do whatever it takes to keep our children safe			0

@entity2 prime minister @entity1 is *cracking* down on internet porn
@entity1 wants the @entity2 's internet service providers to filter out porn by default
to access pornography on home computers , users would have to *opt* in
critics of the plan say effective web filters simply do n't exist
