@entity1 's appearance on " @entity2 " on tuesday topped a week spent cozying up to the world of entertainment , including a dinner hosted by @entity6 that raised $ 15 million and a $ 5,000 - a - plate extravaganza with @entity8			1
presidents have always chased @entity11 's vote			1
@entity13 's first overnight guest in the @entity14 was @entity15 , and @entity16 had dinner parties with @entity18			0
so @entity1 's willingness to dish dirt on the " view " sofa is historically in keeping			1
some in the news media are convinced that @entity1 's endorsement of gay marriage was designed to raise @entity11 dollars			1
they may have a point , but @entity1 was n't just after money			1
the movie community is enjoying a renaissance of cultural power this election cycle , and that 's what the president wants to harness			1
it 's noteworthy that @entity1 's relationship with @entity11 is far from strong			1
his biggest problem has always been his lack of enthusiasm for massaging the egos of movie stars			0
in 2008 , he was certainly happy to take @entity11 's cash : one @entity44 fundraiser alone pulled in $ 9 million			1
but after the election , @entity1 remained aloof from those who had supported him , and invitations to the @entity14 in the first year of the administration were surprisingly few			1
there 's a glimpse of that alleged awkwardness in @entity53 's new book about @entity1			2
in " the amateur : @entity1 in the @entity14 " @entity53 writes , @entity55 arrives at the @entity14 for an interview and is shocked to find that she has to join the queue at security like everyone else			2
she even has to talk to staff who make only $ 75,000 a year ( yes , @entity53 lists that as a complaint ) , and @entity55 is humiliated when @entity62 fails to treat her as an equal			0
clearly the wife of the leader of the free world needs to learn a little humility			0
as a result , there had been rumors in the @entity11 press , before the gay marriage endorsement , about declining political and financial support for the president			1
@entity75 's complaint that @entity1 is too centrist ( " i no longer hope for audacity " ) summed up the mood of the liberal movie community nicely			2
when @entity1 visited @entity11 in september 2011 , he was reduced to appearing at an event hosted by a sitcom actor at the @entity82 rock club			1
yet @entity11 is so good at raising cash that reliance on just a handful of loyal friends can still produce impressive results , as the astonishing $ 15 million takeaway from last week 's @entity6 dinner suggests			2
the biggest bundlers , bringing in $ 500,000 each , include producer @entity91 and @entity93 ceo @entity92 , while actress @entity94 has raised at least $ 200,000			0
there have been $ 38,000 - a - plate dinners with @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100			0
of course , the same - sex marriage endorsement has increased @entity11 enthusiasm for the president and induced liberal skeptics to give more			2
producer @entity105 , who had withheld support until now , announced that he and his wife would give the maximum $ 40,000 each			2
@entity11 is n't just about money ; it also exerts a quiet cultural power			1
@entity110 was right when he credited " @entity113 " with shifting popular attitudes towards homosexuality			0
television has the power to acculturate and acclimatize viewers to social change			2
consider that " @entity120 , " which features a gay couple and their adopted daughter , was ranked the favorite sitcom among @entity119 in 2010			0
incredibly , @entity123 put " @entity125 " star @entity124 in its 2011 listing of the 100 most influential people in the world			0
that 's right : a comedy - musical star is just as important to humanity as @entity132 or @entity133			0
@entity11 's soft power has been augmented in the past four years by two innovations			1
first , @entity136 has dramatically expanded the reach of stars who are n't even explicitly political			0
in 2009 , actor @entity139 entered a contest with @entity141 to see who could reach a million followers first			0
today , he is followed by 10.6 million people , far more than @entity145 's 500,000			0
were @entity139 to write something political , it would require only 10 % of his followers -- and then 10 % of each of their followers -- to retweet it for it to become a viral sensation			0
second , @entity11 's activist base has moved away from pushing candidates and toward campaigning for ideas			1
the falling price of media technology , and the platform that the @entity161 provides , means that moviemakers can now " do it for themselves " rather than wait for the @entity166 to recruit them			0
same - sex marriage is at the center of this revolution , resulting in a plethora of homemade @entity11 ad campaigns			2
local @entity119 and @entity172 are often united in supporting legal efforts to support gay rights , and their focus brings attention to the issue			2
in march , @entity179 's play about @entity181 's @entity180 , which blocked same - sex marriage , was performed in @entity183 with an all - star cast			0
such events , which pursue political rather than strictly electoral goals , are worth millions in publicity to the gay rights movement			0
all this means that even as the money keeps rolling in , @entity1 has to stay on the right side of the moviemakers			1
perhaps this is another reason why he 's intent on playing the culture war card			1
@entity11 is full of rich people , so health care and jobs are n't issues that interest the new power players			1
but two people denied the right to express their love through marriage ? now that 's a great story .			0

@entity206 : @entity1 has done some big @entity11 fundraising in recent days
he says @entity11 *cooled* to @entity1 since its 2008 support
he says @entity11 brings big money , cultural power and is more *proactive* in pushing ideas
@entity206 : @entity1 playing culture war card now in part to stay on right side of moviemakers
