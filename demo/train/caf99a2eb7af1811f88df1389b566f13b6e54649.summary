-- as ceo of public relations agency @entity3 , @entity1 has spent much of her career shaping the corporate reputations of big name clients like @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10			1
with 30 years of experience in the field , she was first introduced to the world of communications by her father , @entity15 , the co-founder of the firm			1
@entity1 does n't just serve the public relations needs for over 250 corporations , governments and non-profits			1
she 's also a member of the @entity22 and has written a book entitled , ' trust : the @entity25 of @entity26 '			1
she opens up to @entity0 about her ascent to ceo and how she led @entity3 to become one of the world 's largest privately - owned communications agencies			1
@entity0 : you speak about five languages and you 've got three degrees			1
where did you think that was going to take you in that time in your life ? @entity1 : well , i was always fascinated by languages and i wanted to be a global person			1
so i was fortunate enough to start learning @entity41 from even before school -- i began nursery school even ... and that sent me on a journey for thinking about how i could really understand different societies and cultures and really be able to communicate with people and live locally in many different settings			2
@entity0 : your father founded the company back in 1948 when the pr industry was in its infancy			1
he was something of a formidable thinker and a bit of a renaissance man			2
were you aware of his reputation growing up ? @entity60 : absolutely			2
i was fortunate enough to be able to go around with him			2
and he worked for wonderful institutions , including the @entity65 for many years -- so i met many of the @entity67 as a child			1
he worked for the @entity69 , so i had a chance to meet the @entity71 and to attend mass at @entity73			2
it was a very exciting , really inspiring time as i grew up serving as an interpreter in some of these countries when he was traveling			1
@entity0 : how hard is it to break out from the mold of being viewed as the boss ' daughter ? @entity60 : you ca n't talk your way out of that one			0
you have to really deliver results			0
the more you can develop an exciting business and really do things that become a hallmark for the firm , that 's when you gain your recognition			1
@entity0 : looking back on your career , was there any particular " @entity97 " moment , when you realized , " i 've made it " ? @entity60 : i never would think that i 've made it ... as a typical @entity101 who came from an immigrant family , there 's still something of that in my dna			2
so never think that you 've made it			0
always think , " what am i going to do tomorrow to make sure that i 'm still staying in a strong position ? @entity0 : do you ever get asked , " how did you get here as a woman ? " @entity60 : i always ask myself this question , maybe because i 'm in the field of public relations			0
but people have n't -- i 've never felt held back , in terms of my gender			0
but i always felt that i 've had to work extra hard			0
so maybe that 's why i did n't face that problem or challenge			2
@entity0 : the world of public relations is actually pretty female heavy already , is n't it ? what are your thoughts on that ? @entity60 : i think there can be a reverse bias that sets in			0
i try to encourage men and women to come into communications ...			0
we might see more men coming into the pr firm because the remuneration is good ... i think diversity both ways is a good thing			1
@entity0 : if you met somebody who had the same aspirations as you did when you first started out , what would your advice be to them ? @entity60 : believe you can do anything you want to do is really the key for me			0
and do n't be afraid			0
be really bold in your thinking			0
close your eyes and dream about what you want to achieve and then just go and do it			0
