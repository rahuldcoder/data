half of the players in monday night 's inaugural @entity3 will walk away with the title of best in their game , but the averages foretell that fewer than 2 % will make it in the pros			1
for the rest , their futures lie elsewhere , and while most of the players taking the field monday are on scholarship and all of them were given an opportunity for an education , whether that opportunity is realized is another matter			0
a recent poll shows that @entity22 sports fans are not surprised that many athletes will squander their shot at education -- because they or someone else has decided that football should be the no. 1 priority while they are in school , because their classes must fit into practice schedules or because their goals are set by athletic departments rather than academic advisers			1
the poll also suggests that most fans have lost faith in the notion of the student - athlete			1
in last week 's @entity42 poll of 1,008 adults , 67 % said they thought universities put too much emphasis on their athletic programs , and only 24 % thought colleges with big - time programs -- such as the @entity49 and @entity50 , which are taking the field in @entity52 , @entity53 , on monday -- find the right academic - athletic balance			1
" @entity22 are in love with big - time college sports , but as the @entity42 poll makes clear , they also recognize that many institutes of higher education are not properly balancing the important mix of athletics and academics , " @entity42 president @entity55 said in a news release			1
the @entity66 could not be reached for comment on the polling data			0
fans feel they know why the balance is off and who 's to blame , according to the poll : three out of four said the pressure of competition in big - time college athletics warps a school 's priorities , while 42 % of respondents said the @entity66 does a poor job of emphasizing the right balance			1
" i think the poll has it right			1
i think @entity22 has a pretty good pulse on what 's going on , " said @entity84 , president of the @entity85 , which strives for @entity66 reform			1
consider the disparity in the numbers			0
while the average in - state public school scholarship is worth about $ 15,000 a year and the average private university scholarship is worth about $ 35,000 annually , according to the @entity66 , top - notch football programs stand to make millions by shipping their teams off to bowl games			1
the @entity98 and @entity99 , two of the @entity102 football conferences , are projected to reel in more than $ 80 million each from bowl season , which they 'll distribute to their member institutions			0
a lot of the money comes from tv rights , and the @entity3 promises to make those rights even more lucrative , as the two playoff games leading up to monday 's showdown -- the @entity112 and @entity113 bowls -- drew 28.2 million and 28.3 million viewers , respectively , making them the most - watched shows in cable history , according to @entity117 , which aired the games			1
by comparison , last year 's @entity120 final between @entity121 and @entity122 , also on @entity117 , recorded an audience of 25.6 million			0
the record for viewership in a championship game , 35.6 million , is the 2006 @entity128 between @entity53 and the @entity129 , which aired on @entity130			0
" when you 're a player , everything tells you that you are there for athletics first , " @entity131 said			0
" you schedule classes around practice , you have to find a major that you can succeed at around that			2
" quarterback @entity140 , who will be starting for @entity50 on monday , apparently received that message when he infamously tweeted as a freshman two years ago , " why should we have to go to class if we came here to play football			1
we ai n't come to play school classes are pointless			2
" he was suspended and has since called the tweet " just a stupid thing to do at that time			0
" last year , when football players at @entity153 -- a school with one of the more admirable academic - athletic reputations -- went to the @entity157 in an attempt to unionize , it was discovered that during the season , athletes devoted 50 hours a week to their sport			1
that 's well above the @entity66 's 20 - hour rule , which mandates that student - athletes may engage in " countable athletically related activities " for only four hours a day and 20 hours a week during the season , and eight hours a week the rest of the year			2
included in those activities are games , practices , film sessions , conditioning , meetings called by coaches and workouts with coaches present , according to the @entity66			0
when @entity153 's daily football schedule was entered into the record during the labor board hearing , it showed that much of the week was about athletics			0
the board later ruled in favor of @entity153 football , citing the demanding hours			0
commissioner @entity185 of the @entity186 , another @entity102 conference , said in 2013 that the 20 - hour rule " is a joke " because there were " too many exemptions , too much falsification of records			2
" among the activities that do not count toward the 20 - hour rule are voluntary workouts , voluntary sports - related activities with no coach present , recruitment activities , traveling to competitions , training room activities , rehabilitation , medical exams and public appearances , the @entity66 states			1
@entity131 cited basketball 's @entity206 as a clear example			0
a team that makes it to the @entity212 , the semifinals of the three - week - long tournament , could miss huge chunks of class , he said			2
@entity217 , the @entity153 player who started the labor union movement , testified during the march 2014 hearing that he was forced to change his major from pre-med because it did n't fit into his practice schedule			0
that 's something athletes at universities across the country echo , @entity131 said			0
" ultimately , you can see it in the graduation rates , " he said			1
" significant time demands are a significant contributor to the poor graduation rates among football and basketball players			1
" you can also see it in the scandals			2
there have been 37 academic fraud scandals since 1990 , according to research done by the @entity242 's @entity241 and @entity243 and @entity245 's @entity244 , professors working on academic reform			1
that includes the latest and largest scandal at the @entity250 , which was once revered for its ability to produce talented athletes who also succeeded in the classroom			0
much of that success has now been called into question , as an independent investigation uncovered an 18 - year cheating scandal last year			2
the investigation , conducted by former prosecutor @entity259 , found that thousands of athletes who were underprepared or too busy with athletics were funneled into " paper classes " where a one - time paper was accepted for an easy grade			2
many of those papers were plagiarized , and administrators often knew it , the investigation found			0
" i think the @entity250 example stands as a testimony to what little opportunity these athletes have for a real education , " said @entity241 , who is current president of the @entity270 for academic integrity in collegiate sport			2
" the @entity66 and ( its president ) @entity279 , specifically @entity279 , promise athletes a world - class education , and that simply is not true and a boldface lie when it pertains to football and men 's basketball players in @entity287 " @entity1 's @entity288 contributed to this report .			0

poll : only 24 % feel programs like @entity293 , @entity50 find academic - athletic balance
3 of 4 of those polled say competitive pressure of sports warps school priorities
scandals , graduation rates indicate @entity22 fans understand reality , expert says
