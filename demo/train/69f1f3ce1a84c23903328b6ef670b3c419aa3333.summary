-- in the seven years since its founding , @entity1 has become a go - to place for news updates , witty one - liners , political one - upmanship and even absurdist storytelling			1
it 's also become a go - to place for intolerant bile			1
on sunday night , @entity10 , an @entity11 of @entity13 ancestry , was named @entity14			1
immediately , the @entity15 started spewing			0
" this is @entity14 ... not miss @entity18 , " said @ @entity16			1
our @entity14 is one of you , " posted @ @entity24			1
what is it about @entity1 ? whether the events are earthshaking or trivial , the site of more than a half - billion accounts has something to say -- and often , it 's upset			1
@entity32 is named the new @entity33 ; the anger flows			0
@entity35 is acquitted ; people fly off the handle			0
comments on sports , tv shows , politics , news media -- when there 's something negative to be said , it will be said ( occasionally with poor spelling and in all @entity47 ) on @entity1			1
as @entity48 summarized the @entity14 outcry on " @entity50 , " " and @entity1 , as usual , could not be happy			1
" @entity51 , a @entity52 - based psychiatrist who specializes in personality dynamics , observes that @entity1 's impulsiveness can get the best of people			1
" it 's very easy to jot something off and hit send , and you can impulsively say something without thinking it through , " he says , noting that it 's the reverse of the classic angry letter you write and then put in a drawer until you cool off			1
" with @entity1 , you do n't need to ( do that )			2
and if there is feedback or push back , you do n't necessarily even see it			0
" as of friday afternoon , @entity1 had not responded to a request from @entity0 for comment			2
' @entity71 is more influential ' such anger is n't just limited to @entity1 , of course			1
you can find it on other social media platforms , news site comment boards -- including on @entity0 -- and pretty much all over the @entity77			0
@entity79 , for example , also has been known for attracting mean - spirited comments			0
still , @entity1 is an easy target			2
besides the impulsiveness @entity51 mentions , there 's a typical litany of virtual - world reasons for @entity1 's vitriol : anonymity , a perceived lack of consequences , a troll - ish desire to stir the pot. but perhaps the most intriguing was revealed in a study published recently by @entity95 researchers			1
by analyzing posts on @entity98 , a @entity99 version of @entity1 , they determined that anger is the most powerful online emotion			1
of the four basic emotions into which they classified tweets , sadness and disgust barely travel			0
but anger , like a potent virus , spreads the fastest and most widely of all			0
" our results show that anger is more influential than other emotions like joy , which indicates that the angry tweets can spread quickly and broadly in the network , " the researchers wrote			1
23 key moments from @entity1 history the idea of @entity1 anger is so prominent that @entity122 , a geography professor at @entity123 in @entity124 , put together a map titled " @entity126			1
" the project was inspired , in part , by racial slurs on @entity1 after president @entity131 's re-election			1
the map highlights sections of the country that engage in certain hate speech based on keywords , aggregated by county and adjusted for population			0
the results have favored rural areas , which @entity122 attributes to insularity and fear of outsiders			0
indeed , a more accurate title for the map would be " the geography of xenophobia , " she says			0
the map certainly hit home with certain parts of the country , @entity122 says			0
" so many people lashed out in anger towards me after seeing it , " she says			2
" i have hundreds of really angry e-mails that start with the term ' racist bitch			0
' " anonymity and distance this is n't the sort of thing that tends to happen as widely on @entity163 or other social media sites			2
there are a couple reasons for that , says @entity168 , a professor at @entity170 's @entity169			2
one is that @entity163 is largely a closed system in which you mainly communicate with people you know -- unlike @entity1 , where a tweet goes out to the whole world			1
moreover , @entity163 friends can react more directly to vitriolic posts , either by calling the poster out or simply unfriending him or her , she says			1
in may , the site strengthened policies to stamp out hate speech			0
" with @entity163 , there 's more accountability , " says @entity168			1
" most people 's @entity163 accounts have multiple pictures of them , they 've got connections to ' these are my friends			1
' there 's a lot less of the anonymity , so there 's a little less of the disinhibition that occurs			0
" @entity1 also creates more distance , adds @entity200 , a communications professor at @entity201			2
" it 's asynchronous -- you 're not chatting real - time with another person -- so there 's less of a sense that the other people out there are real , " she says			1
a phone call or even some kinds of online dialogue establishes a connection that you 're dealing with actual human beings			0
but on @entity1 , that connection is n't there , so " that allows us to go off in ways that we would n't choose to do if we had to look at another person 's face when we did it			1
" consequences ? @entity1 's brief screeds seldom have consequences , though that may be changing			1
the site recently created a " report abuse " button and the media -- which is often to blame for highlighting anger -- is paying more attention to bullying on the site			2
but the idea of consequences is hard for @entity1 users to understand , observes @entity200			2
" i think people do n't think about the long - term ramifications , " she says			2
" when i talk with students about how they use social media and say that a lot of employers will look to see what kinds of things you 're posting on @entity163 or @entity1 , i 'm surprised by the number of people who say , ' any employer that would stalk me that way online , i would n't want to work for them anyway			1
' " there are signs that a growing number of @entity1 users do n't like the venom in their midst			2
after the nastiness with @entity14 , a number of people responded with positive tweets congratulating her			1
some even reprimanded the angry tweeters -- and received apologies			2
" i am so sorry			0
i did n't think before i tweeted what i did			0
i absolutely did not mean to hurt or offend anyone			0
again i am so very sorry ! ! ! " tweeted @ @entity262			0
@entity200 points out that the system has much to overcome			0
" people use @entity1 to get reactions out of others , " she says			1
" it 's like a popularity contest : if you can put something out there that 's quick and inflammatory and it gets retweeted a ton , that 's your feedback -- that 's how you know that it was an interesting or effective tweet			2
and people do n't seem to be as concerned if the response is positive or negative			0
" and what works ? let 's all scream it at the top of our lungs : anger			0
" @entity71 is an empowering emotion			0
you can post something angry and it can make other people feel something			0
it allows us an opportunity to be dramatic , " says @entity200			0
" and a lot of people really like drama			0

the crowning of @entity14 on sunday led to angry , often *bigoted* tweets
@entity1 has become a go - to place for online anger
many reasons : it 's fast , brief , requires little thought -- and anger is powerful
such *behavior* is less common on @entity163 , where people interact mostly with friends
