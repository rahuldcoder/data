-- you might have heard : @entity2 and @entity3 secretly tied the knot at last			1
a spokesperson for the couple announced that the pair wed privately in a nondenominational civil ceremony in @entity9 over the weekend			0
so ends years of speculation as to when , if ever , one of @entity13 's more famously liberal couples will finally make it official			1
the first question , of course : why now ? with the recent , public undoing of some long - term celebrity marriages — @entity21 and @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 — it 's tempting to wonder why another celebrity couple would even bother			0
@entity2 and @entity3 have sustained a seemingly successful relationship ( and built a rather large family ) without marriage , and the pair is famously liberal besides — the sort of people you might assume are among those a recent @entity34 survey found to increasingly consider marriage passé			1
on the road to obsolete			0
but while marriage in the @entity40 is indeed at a record low , there are still considerable benefits to getting hitched			1
marriage confers many financial rights : federal provisions provide benefits and protections exclusively to married couples , as they also do to small businesses , homeowners and the unemployed			1
that 's one reason millions of gay @entity40 , and their friends and supporters , continue to fight for the right to marry traditionally			2
it also comes with emotional , psychological and intellectual benefits			2
according to studies cited by the @entity61 , people in happy marriages are healthier , have more and better sex , and are richer than their unmarried counterparts -- not that it matters to @entity2 and @entity65			2
research also shows that the more education and financial independence a woman has , the more likely she is to stay married			0
but let 's not forget that if you are a celebrity , marriage also does a pretty good job of , you guessed it , garnering press			2
a cynical view , perhaps , but not unwarranted , especially when you consider @entity2 and @entity3 have never exactly shied away from using their relationship and their children as story hooks			1
it 's hard not to wonder if the announcement of the marriage had anything to do with his upcoming film , " @entity89 , " set for release in october , or hers , " unbroken , " which she directed , due out @entity88			2
meanwhile , this summer the two began filming " @entity100 , " their first film as co-stars since " @entity97 , " the movie that sparked their romance			0
at the very least , the many , many reports on their marriage will surely mention these projects , as -- oh , look -- i 've just gone and done			0
@entity2 and @entity3 's decision to marry after a decade and six children seems like an incredibly informed one that reflects recent research from the @entity61 , which finds couples who make intentional decisions regarding " major relationship transitions , " rather than just letting things happen because it 's the next logical step , are more likely to have successful marriages			1
and indeed , their union is representative of the rising rates of cohabitation before marriage , which gives people more time to make sure theirs is a good choice			1
so maybe that 's it			0
maybe these two waited so long precisely because they do n't take marriage ( his second , her third ) lightly			0
getting more moviegoers in seats as a result ? well , that 's just the icing on the proverbial wedding cake .			0

@entity138 : @entity3 and @entity2 seemed to be doing just fine without tying knot
@entity138 says marriage in @entity40 is at a record low , but it still offers *substantial* benefits
@entity138 : couples who make intentional choice , or live together first , more likely to last
