-- a day after @entity5 majority leader @entity4 's almost unprecedented primary loss , his defeat is being felt far from his central @entity7 congressional district			1
aftershocks from @entity4 's loss at the hands of a little known and underfunded tea party supporter and economics professor rocked the political world -- from the campaign trail to the halls of @entity17 and the @entity5			1
the ouster of the no. 2 @entity19 , who was seen by many as the next speaker , overturns the chamber 's leadership hierarchy , and effectively kills any chance of immigration reform			1
" it 's just sending shivers throughout the @entity19 conference , " veteran @entity29 rep. @entity28 of @entity30 told @entity0 chief congressional correspondent @entity31			1
and @entity35 's @entity37 win will embolden a tea party movement that 's experienced more defeats than victories so far this primary season			1
" this is a major shot in the arm for the tea party movement , " said @entity42 , a top official at @entity43 , a leading organizer of grassroots conservatives			1
7 reasons @entity4 lost here are five things we learned from the political upset of the year : 1			2
showing up matters : @entity4 apparently took things for granted			2
how @entity4 's ' @entity55 ' fell apart " @entity4 lost this race as much as @entity35 won it			1
he simply violated rule number one of politics : go home , " said @entity0 chief national correspondent @entity57			0
" this is @entity4 's fault			1
he was in @entity62 on primary day			2
not back in his district			0
" he also turned down last - minute help from political allies			2
" his confidence , his arrogance , his smugness cost him his seat , " @entity57 added			0
@entity4 did n't read the pulse of conservatives in his @entity19 - dominated district			2
" my sense from talking to people in the 7th is that he had lost touch with the base of the @entity81 there , and by the time he realized it and tried to make amends , it was too late , " @entity7 political analyst @entity74 said			2
" @entity4 's loss proves speaker @entity87 's point about all politics being local			1
the tea party movement may be stumbling in some places , but there was a lot of local tea party frustration at @entity4			1
he is seen as removed from the issues they care about , such as on immigration			0
they saw him as trying to have it both ways , and they called him on it , " added @entity74 , director of the @entity98 at @entity99			0
contrast that with @entity29 sen. @entity106 of @entity107 , a frequent target of conservatives , who easily bested six primary challengers from the right on tuesday			0
" to @entity106 's credit , he ran a great campaign			0
i think the assumption among a lot of people was that he 'd solely wage an air war , but i was impressed with the way he also ran a traditional , grassroots - focused campaign in addition to a compelling broadcast message			0
and @entity106 himself spent a lot of time on the ground here holding events and interacting one - on - one with voters , " @entity107 @entity19 consultant @entity129 told @entity0			0
@entity106 tended to the folks back home			0
apparently @entity4 did n't go home enough			2
the tea party is alive and well : remember all those stories earlier this spring about the demise of the tea party			1
@entity4 challenger , @entity35 , ' shocked ' as results rolled in the five - year - old anti-establishment grassroots conservative movement suffered a string of high profile defeats to incumbents and other mainstream republicans earlier in the primary season			2
but the tide may be turning a bit			0
and with a bunch of tea party vs. establishment primary battles yet to come , what happened in @entity7 will only embolden the grassroots			1
@entity4 becomes the second member of @entity17 running for re-election this year to go down to defeat in the primaries , following @entity19 rep. @entity160 of @entity161 , who lost a runoff contest two weeks ago			2
longtime sen. @entity163 of @entity164 may soon become the third			0
he 's fighting for his political life as he faces a primary runoff in two weeks against a tea party backed state senator who narrowly edged him in last week 's primary			1
@entity43 , which is among the groups supporting @entity163 challenger @entity164 state sen. @entity172 , says the @entity4 defeat will only help their efforts			2
" what happened last night in @entity7 is just like adding jet fuel on that fire			0
our grassroots person is getting inundated with requests from activists to help			0
they 're saying ' what can we do			0
what can we do , ' " said @entity42 of @entity43			0
@entity186 also agreed that @entity4 's defeat will give the tea party more mojo			1
" this victory is the ' @entity197 ' equivalent of the adrenaline needle plunged into the chest of the tea party , " said @entity29 consultant @entity190 , who served as a top strategist and adviser top @entity5 and @entity194 @entity81 leaders			1
who said the tea party was dead ? 3			1
there will be a @entity5 leadership shakeup : @entity5 @entity29 members and aides say they are still reeling from the news and it 's still sinking in			1
there were a flurry of calls between leadership offices and small gatherings of @entity5 @entity29 members on tuesday night as the results came in , but multiple @entity29 leadership aides say it 's still unclear what happens next			2
" it 's just stunning , " @entity29 rep. @entity28 of @entity30 said			0
" and we 're trying to analyze what really happened here			0
" @entity4 's expected to announce he will step down as @entity223 effective july 31 , a senior @entity5 @entity19 source told @entity0 's bash			1
and the move could trigger a fight to replace him			0
@entity4 's stunning upset does make it more likely that @entity5 speaker @entity229 stays in office			1
according to a @entity29 source , @entity229 reaffirmed his colleagues wednesday that he was " all in for speaker " in the next @entity17 and then got a standing ovation			0
@entity29 whip @entity235 of @entity236 is expected to announce his intention to move up the leadership ladder and run for majority leader			1
he is popular and helped raise money and elect many of the new members of the conference			0
@entity4 said if @entity235 runs , he would be " an outstanding majority leader " and would back him			1
but conservative members are already demanding someone from a red state be elected to represent their views at the leadership table			0
several @entity5 conservatives have pointed to @entity250 rep. @entity249 , who currently heads the group of fiscal conservatives in the @entity5 , @entity161 rep. @entity253 , @entity255 rep. @entity254 , and @entity257 rep. @entity256 as possible candidates for leadership jobs			2
rep. @entity260 of @entity161 told reporters wednesday that he 's planning to run for majority leader			1
rep. @entity263 of @entity264 , the @entity266 chair and top women in the leadership team , announced that she will stay put in her current position and not bid for the majority leader position			1
immigration reform is dead for now : the vast majority of @entity273 already decided they did n't want to vote on any immigration bills before the midterm election			1
those advocates who were pushing for action conceded that even the most minor steps would have to wait until primary challenges were over			0
but after a low - profile and underfunded tea party candidate who ran almost solely on railing against @entity4 's embrace of " amnesty " beat him soundly any prospects for action have evaporated			1
@entity4 embraced some of the most minor immigration reforms so @entity291 fearful of losing their own jobs wo n't want to touch the issue			2
" the members who want immigration reform will still be pushing it , but last night 's election makes the road they must travel much steeper , " said @entity29 strategist @entity294 , who was a top aide to one - time speaker @entity295 and @entity296 when he was majority whip			1
2014 midterms : what 's at stake complete midterm coverage 5			0
if you can believe it , gridlock on @entity307 will get worse : the partisan toxic pre-midterm election atmosphere in @entity62 was already bad			2
just getting the most basic bills passed to keep the government running has been a herculean task			0
@entity28 told @entity0 's bash the loss will mean members will have less motivation to work across the aisle			2
@entity28 added that the message to @entity5 @entity29 members is " negotiation or compromise could get you beat			0
" @entity294 added that the @entity4 loss throws the @entity19 conference into chaos and makes it harder to get anything done			1
@entity0 senior political analyst @entity329 agreed			0
" for @entity4 to be knocked off by a tea party conservative over his efforts to push for immigration reform and his earlier efforts to lift the debt ceiling , i think it will send shockwaves through @entity19 ranks			1
look at the price he paid for doing things the majority of @entity345 support , " said @entity329 a senior adviser to both @entity340 and @entity19 presidents			0
@entity346 is the @entity347 who no longer has to face @entity4			0

@entity4 's loss is sending " shivers " through the @entity350
@entity5 leadership shakeup - @entity4 is expected to resign as majority leader
with @entity4 's defeat , the tea party is not dead , but immigration reform probably is
political *climate* in @entity62 already poison , but @entity4 loss likely will make it harder to do anything
