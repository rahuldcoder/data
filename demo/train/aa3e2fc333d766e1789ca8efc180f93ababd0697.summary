-- @entity2 's flirtation with democracy has come to an end			2
if it wants to , the social network can now change its policies without user approval			0
a weeklong open vote on proposed policy changes , including whether to keep public voting and how data is shared with affiliates such as @entity14 , closed monday			1
if @entity2 goes ahead with its plans , this will be the last such public vote			1
for the results to be binding , more than 30 % of @entity2 users had to participate in the vote , which was hosted on the site by a third - party app developer			1
@entity2 says it has more than a billion active users , so that meant at least 300 million members would have needed to vote			1
but only .2 % of that amount went to the virtual polls			1
in his blog post announcing the vote last week , @entity2 vice president of communications @entity28 said , " if turnout is less than 30 % , the vote will be advisory			1
" even with a sliver of the required votes , it 's clear what @entity2 users who voted are advising @entity2 to do			2
of the 668,752 members who did participate , 88 % voted to stick with the existing policies			0
the two documents @entity2 wishes to update are its data use policy and its statement of rights and responsibilities			2
the changes under consideration include updating the language of privacy controls to better explain what it means to hide content from your timeline			0
another update would change how @entity2 shares user data with companies it owns or partners with , most notably @entity14			0
the social network also wants to drop the voting system , which it established in 2009 as a response to privacy concerns			2
" we will be announcing the results and the next steps regarding the governance process shortly , so check back soon , " read a post monday on the official @entity63			0
now a third - party auditor will verify the tallies			0
but unless 299 million virtual votes were somehow misplaced , the results are clear .			0

an open vote on @entity2 policy changes closes after a week
it received only .2 % of 300 million votes needed for results to be binding
@entity2 must now *decide* whether it will go ahead with the updates
proposed changes include doing away with the voting system , changing how data is shared
