@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 ceo @entity3 this week rebuffed the suggestion that @entity4 will revolutionize tv in the same way it has reshaped the music industry , mobile phones and tablet computers			1
but @entity3 is bluffing : the time is right for @entity4 for tackle the tv , and the company 's re-entry into that market is a no - brainer			1
just a " hobby " " smarter people than us will figure this out " was @entity3 ' deflective response to a question about @entity4 's tv aspirations at the @entity20 on tuesday			1
subsidized business models essentially give customers a set - top box for free , @entity3 argued ; why would they pay for another ? he explained that the lack of a national cable operator , not to mention the lack of standards around tv , has led to @entity32 , or the breakup into smaller units : " it 's a fundamental go - to - market problem			1
" " @entity6 is a hobby , " he added in reference to the company 's neglected set - top box offering			1
@entity3 ' denials the deflection is latest in a long line of half - truths from @entity3			1
it 's a smart tactic that allows the company to lower market expectations and fool competitors			1
in 2003 , @entity3 said of @entity4 's rumored entry into the cell phone business : " we did n't think we 'd do well in the cell phone business			1
what we 've done instead is , we 've written what we think is some of the best software in the world to start syncing information between devices			0
" four years later , the @entity56 reshaped the smartphone market			0
in the same interview , @entity3 proclaimed , " there are no plans to make a tablet			1
it turns out people want keyboards			0
we look at the tablet , and we think it is going to fail			0
" this week , @entity4 announced that more than 2 million @entity67 have been sold since the touchscreen device was released in april			2
@entity3 is remarkably consistent in his misdirection			2
two years previous to the launch of the $ 499 @entity67 , he claimed : " we do n't know how to make a $ 500 computer that 's not a piece of junk			0
our dna will not let us do that			0
" prior to adding video support to the @entity77 , he professed : " i 'm not convinced people want to watch movies on a tiny little screen			0
" before the launch of @entity4 's ibook store : " it does n't matter how good or bad the product is ; the fact is that people do n't read anymore			1
" @entity3 ' denial of a new service is by no means evidence against its existence ; the contrary , in fact			2
the tv opportunity the @entity95 - connected tv is an idea that 's finally ripe for consumer adoption			1
or more precisely : the tv as a platform			0
@entity4 's @entity100 is an obvious starting point to turn the tv into an entertainment hub ; it brings your purchased music , tv shows and movies to the big screen			1
but @entity6 , the company 's first foray into the television business , boasted this exact integration and failed to take the world by storm			0
what has changed ? the glaring opportunity is for @entity4 to bring the @entity114 to tv			1
with access to millions of applications -- including games -- on a big screen , the television would finally become engaging			0
the blockbuster launch of the @entity67 has proved that a screen , once connected to an endless supply of content and applications through @entity100 and the @entity114 , becomes infinitely more powerful			0
the tv is simply a larger screen			0
competitive pressure this opportunity has n't been lost on @entity128			0
its upcoming @entity130 product will run its mobile @entity132 os. the reason is simple : thanks to @entity132 , @entity134 will benefit from the app ecosystem @entity128 already built for mobile phones			0
@entity128 's strategy also points to a solution to the " set - top box problem " : while @entity128 will offer a separate box , the company has additionally partnered with @entity143 to have the software pre-installed in some @entity134			1
such a union is less likely in @entity4 's case , however : @entity4 has always preferred to create its own hardware			2
and while @entity3 denies that consumers want another box in their living rooms , i 'd wager that rumors of a $ 99 set - top box running the @entity154 are indeed accurate			2
beating @entity32 the cable operator issue is trickier , but similar @entity32 in the phone space proved no barrier to @entity4 's @entity56 ambitions			1
the same will be true here			0
@entity4 may name multiple cable companies as partners or simply sidestep the problem ; bringing @entity4 's app ecosystem to the biggest screen in the house is a compelling proposition on its own			2
and yet ... jobs doth protest too much			0
the @entity4 ceo explained the cable cartel in such labored terms that he must surely be in the process of untangling that thorny issue			0
so my bet is that @entity4 will indeed strike deals with cable companies to produce a comprehensive offering for tv watchers			2
@entity6 : a matter of time will @entity4 take another shot at television ? it 's inevitable			2
the @entity95 - enabled tv is coming , and @entity4 is perfectly positioned to join the fray			1

@entity95 - connected tv is idea that 's finally ripe for consumer adoption
in past , @entity3 has denied that @entity4 was planning to enter the cell phone or tablet markets
his deflections are smart tactic that allows company to fool competitors
