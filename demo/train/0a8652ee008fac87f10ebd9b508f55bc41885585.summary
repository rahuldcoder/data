-- this past friday , @entity1 held the third and last presidential debate before polling day on june 14			1
unlike the previous two debates , the question of @entity1 foreign policy took center stage			1
this turned the debate into one of the most animated political clashes aired on @entity1 state - run television in years			2
exchanges were so heated that the candidates were later accused of having revealed national secrets during the debate			1
one candidate linked with the reformist movement , @entity20 , has since been warned that he may be barred from running in the elections because of confidential material he revealed about @entity1 's nuclear program during the two hour - long debate			1

the eight candidates [ now six after @entity31 and @entity32 withdrew this week ] have , after all , been carefully approved by the @entity34 -- the regime 's top vetting agency -- and can not therefore be considered as individuals likely or able to greatly shift the trajectory of the foreign policy of the @entity40			1
from the perspective of the critics , the elections on june 14 are just window dressing by @entity1 's @entity45 , the unelected ayatollah @entity46 whose stringent islamism and anti-western worldview has characterized his tenure since he came to power in 1989			1
the reservations held by the critics are perfectly justified			0
the june 14 elections are undeniably tightly orchestrated			1
some 678 individual hopefuls were after all barred to even enter the race			0
nevertheless , there is also no doubt that the eight men who were admitted to the race do not see eye - to - eye about the regime 's foreign policy record or the best path ahead for this large @entity64 country of 76 million people			1

the conventional fault line separating reformists from hardline candidates was very hard to detect , with the most bitter exchanges taking place among hardliners			0
one of the most heated exchanges took place between @entity82 , foreign minister from 1981 to 1997 , and @entity84 , who is judged by many to be favored by @entity46			2
@entity84 has been leading @entity1 's nuclear negotiation team since 2007			1
@entity82 questioned @entity84 's diplomatic aptitude , accusing his team of pointless intransigence when negotiating with the world powers about @entity1 's nuclear program			1
" negotiations are about give - and - take and not about reading out loud your own manifesto , " @entity82 shouted at @entity92			0
@entity82 's charge was remarkable because the bland @entity84 -- who has no political base of his own -- has over the years been regarded to simply represent the views of supreme leader @entity46			0
meanwhile , all the candidates agreed that @entity29 has to adjust its nuclear posture during negotiations but no one raised the logic behind having the program in the first place			0
that would be breaking one taboo too many and @entity46 has made it clear he will not allow the regime to give up the program			0
another taboo that was nearly broken came when @entity112 , a long - time former commander of @entity1 's feared @entity113 ( @entity113 ) , accused @entity84 of having wasted an opportunity to reach a compromise with the @entity116 when the two sides met in @entity118 in may 2012			1
here was @entity112 , who led the @entity113 when @entity84 was barely a teenager in the heyday of @entity1 's anti-americanism in the early 1980s , speaking of not meeting with the @entity116 but compromising with them as well			1
no one would have blamed @entity112 if he had argued for less interaction with the world			0
@entity112 is after all the only candidate for whom there is a valid " @entity126 " -- issued by @entity127 at the request of @entity129 , for his alleged role in the 1994 terrorist attack against a @entity133 cultural center in @entity134			0
and yet even @entity112 argued against @entity1 isolationism			2
read more : @entity137 article on @entity112 's candidacy among the candidates , points of agreement were few and far between but all eight men agreed on one point : that the 8 - year record of sitting president @entity145 had been a disaster for @entity1			2
@entity145 was blamed for pursuing an unnecessarily adventurist , incompetent and costly foreign policy			2
each candidate made the claim that @entity145 's bombastic sloganeering abroad could not hide the lack of substance behind his actions			0
attacks on @entity145 's performance have become so prolific that the sitting president has asked for airtime on national television to defend his record			2
on saturday , @entity145 went further and said he " had nothing to do with the nuclear program " and " someone else is responsible for it			0
" read more : @entity20 -- the man to revive @entity1 's reformist movement ? this was an abdication of responsibility and the " someone else " was an obvious reference to @entity46			1
no @entity1 politician can look the @entity1 people in the eye and take credit for the painful economic sanctions , which have come about as a result of the nuclear standoff			2
and @entity145 has a point			0
he ca n't blame all of his many shameful statements on @entity46 -- such as denouncing the @entity1 @entity181 opposition as " dirt " or denying the @entity183 -- but the fact is he never single - handedly controlled @entity1 's nuclear policy			1
the presidency in the @entity40 just does not have that kind of clout			0
the main message from the debate is that @entity1 foreign policy is in shambles and a new page has to be turned			1
there were differences in nuance and each candidate claimed particular strengths but the consensus is that @entity1 can not become another @entity200			2
as @entity82 put it " it is good that we now have circles of friendly states in @entity205 and @entity206 , but that is not enough			0
" again and again , the need to overhaul ties with the @entity116 and @entity212 countries was raised , leading at times to shouting matches about which candidate has the knack to defuse the crisis with the western world			0
nevertheless , while there was broad agreement that @entity1 has to do a far better job at paving the path for a compromise with the @entity223 , no one directly touched the elephant in the room : the role of the unelected ayatollah @entity46 in shaping @entity1 's foreign policy			1
they did so only in a roundabout way			0
all admitted that @entity46 is a central voice in any strategic decision - making and yet no one dared to openly question the wisdom of the 73 - year old @entity45			0
but if @entity46 watched this third debate -- as he surely did -- then he could not have missed the writing on the wall			0
even among these very carefully regime - approved candidates the cry for an overhaul of @entity1 foreign policy could not have been any louder .			1

@entity1 head to the polling booths on friday june 14
the third and last presidential debate friday focused on foreign policy
the exchange was so heated that candidates were accused of revealing national secrets
the key message from the debate was @entity1 's foreign policy needs reforming
