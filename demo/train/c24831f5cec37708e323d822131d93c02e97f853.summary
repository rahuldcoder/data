on most days , the gorgeous @entity0 in @entity1 , @entity2 , looks like the perfect place to start a new romance			0
this @entity7 , however , it 'll be used to end one			1
that 's the day a couple from @entity11 , @entity2 , with help from a company called @entity14 , will come together for the last time as husband and wife to finalize legal proceedings and make their divorce official			1
married for 25 years with four children , @entity20 and @entity21 ( who prefer not to provide their last names ) are both in their mid- 40s			1
@entity20 works in the construction business in @entity24 , @entity21 is a medical professional			0
amid the lush grounds of the resort in the foothills of @entity2 's @entity32 , the details of their split will be made official over three days , with wine and maybe spa treatments on the side			1
" the hotel is actually known for weddings , " says @entity21			0
" it 's got a great spa and it 's in a great town with really good atmosphere			2
" if you get stressed you can get a massage or a facial			0
" though they share a " warped sense of humor , " the couple insists their @entity7 divorce is no joking matter			1
" we 're not trying to be flip about divorce , " says @entity21			2
" it was a long hard road to finally make this decision -- whether you 've been married five or 10 or 25 years , divorce is never easy -- but it 's best for both of us and our family , the six of us			1
" we do n't hate each other and we wo n't hate each other and this has lot to do with it			0
we 're not taking this as a joke , but we can still joke about it			0
" if that attitude about something as potentially soul - crushing as divorce surprises you , the story behind the company that 's facilitating what it calls a " special ceremony " might make you a believer			1
though combining divorce and vacation might seem as @entity78 ( and heart - friendly ) as fried chicken and waffles , @entity14 is actually a @entity82 company , founded in the @entity82 in 2011 on , if you can believe it , @entity7			1
the company does n't actually own or operate any hotels -- it partners with various properties to host divorce proceedings -- but says the concept behind its vision of " divorce vacations " is both pragmatic and positive			1
" we started @entity14 because a lot of divorce procedures end up in fights that drag on for months and sometimes years , " says company founder @entity91 , who is neither married nor divorced			1
" the element of time destroys a lot of divorce procedures and a lot of lawyers and other professionals delay procedures on purpose based on their hourly rate			2
" @entity14 provides mediation services prior to the final divorce procedures , during which it enforces a strict three - day timeline to wrap things up			1
it operates on a flat fee			0
the couple tells @entity3 they 're paying a total of $ 6,500 for their divorce -- that includes mediation and dealing with the legal end of the divorce , the hotel bill and resort weekend , including some meals , and $ 1,000 or so in state filing fees			2
" the longer a divorce procedure takes the bigger the risk the procedure will fail , because more and more people with opinions will be involved and make it complex , " says @entity91			2
" we are able to split up our spouses in a clean and positive way			2
" " we have friends we 've seen go through divorces and it usually takes years , " says @entity130			0
" even when it starts off amicably , by the time it gets to trial everybody 's seething with hatred and making all sorts of crazy accusations			0
" a buddy of mine was married for five and a half years and over $ 30,000 that they could n't agree about ( in mediation ) , it ended up costing him $ 200,000 ( mostly in legal fees ) and it 's probably going to cost him his house			1
" @entity20 and @entity21 will travel to the resort separately and stay in separate rooms			0
" i 'm not looking forward to this weekend , but it 's taking a lot of stress out of an already stressful situation , " says @entity21 , emphasizing that the couple 's split is amicable			1
" it makes it much easier to deal with			0
" making a tough situation easier sounds good , but why target the day associated with heart - shaped chocolate boxes and other hopeful " @entity162 " sentimentality ? " when you think about it , this weekend has twofold meaning , " says @entity21 , who , along with @entity20 , says the @entity7 timing is pure coincidence			2
" friday is friday the 13th			0
then we have @entity7 ... we are trying to keep our sense of humor			2
" does @entity171 have something against @entity7 ? " we started @entity14 in 2011 on @entity7 to show the world we believe it is possible to split up in a positive way , " he says			1
" it 's more that we have an association with @entity7 -- positivity			1
" you could say this is one special			0
it will be the first time in our existence we will process a divorce on @entity7			1
" " @entity194 " might not be the word @entity20 and @entity21 would settle on -- both make it clear the divorce decision process has been incredibly difficult and painful -- but they 're at least satisfied with their decision to take care of the details the way they have			0
" the whole notion of sitting in the cold , antiseptic environment of a courtroom or a conference room with attorneys and hash out all the details of my life , i did n't want it , " says @entity130			0
" that 's not how we began our relationship and it 's not how we should end it			0

couple 's @entity7 split makes point about *emotional* toll of divorce
@entity14 says its service is *cheaper* than going through courts
" it is possible to split up in a positive way , " says company founder .
couple has been married 25 years and has four children
