" i 'm hoping that the @entity1 and the government of @entity2 will not choose to take the security solution road because that was already tested in other @entity36 countries and , by @entity40 , it did not work , " said @entity31 , who 's in @entity2			1
on saturday , the @entity2 government downplayed friday 's protests in the @entity43 , saying the people were n't calling for a regime change			1

@entity74 was arrested sunday after he gave a sermon two days earlier , on february 25 , stating that @entity2 should become a constitutional monarchy , human rights activists said			2

@entity2 has cracked down on protests in the past			0
@entity66 are a minority in @entity2			2
they live primarily in the @entity43 , where many major oil companies operate			0
