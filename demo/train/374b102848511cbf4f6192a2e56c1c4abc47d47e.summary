-- it should be time to celebrate key milestones in the fight against @entity5 and @entity6			1
recently , the @entity7 announced that new hiv infections and @entity6 - related deaths fell to their lowest levels since the epidemic 's peak			1
today , 6.6 million people in low - and middle - income countries are on life - saving antiretroviral therapy , and people with @entity5 are living longer			0
but because of the shortsightedness of many wealthy countries , we are once again at risk of losing an opportunity to contain and control this deadly epidemic			2
the announcement by the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) of these gains was quickly followed by much more sobering news			1
the @entity28 -- the main financier of @entity5 programs around the world -- reported deep funding shortfalls as @entity34 countries shrink or skip their promised @entity28 payments			1
the @entity28 is freezing expenditures for existing @entity5 treatment programs and removing hundreds of millions in funding for new programs			1
the result ? fewer people on @entity5 treatment , more hiv , more @entity6 , more orphans , more misery , more death			1
the world has been on the cusp of a promising new era in combating @entity5 before			0
at the 2005 @entity51 in @entity52 , @entity53 , the globe 's most powerful economies committed to fund universal access to hiv prevention , treatment and care by 2010			2
the global community fell short by half			0
because of that , there were millions of new -- preventable -- @entity5 infections , with widespread morbidity and mortality and massive economic and social costs			2
tragically , the @entity5 pandemic continued to expand			0
earlier this year , at the @entity7 , the same players renewed their pledge to fund universal access by 2015			0
yet we now hear news of shrinking resources in the face of massive need			0
let 's be clear -- the @entity75 is a leader in funding the fight against @entity5			1
since then - president @entity80 's @entity79 ( @entity79 ) launched in 2003 , @entity75 support has provided millions of @entity5 - infected people with access to antiretroviral therapy			2
today , the @entity75 commitment remains strong , through the @entity87 administration 's @entity85 in @entity75 and @entity88 , and secretary of state @entity90 's recent call for an @entity6 - free generation			1
@entity93 's goal hinges on a handful of key initiatives , including the immediate expansion of a program known as " treatment as prevention " and a corresponding increase in funding for the @entity28			1
treatment as prevention , which calls for widespread testing for @entity5 and treatment for those testing positive , was pioneered at the @entity107 in hiv / aids in @entity109 , @entity110			2
effective treatment of a person living with @entity5 puts the virus into virtual long - term remission and dramatically reduces its transmission , preventing further infections			2
leading global health organizations such as the @entity118 , @entity25 and the @entity119 support the expansion of " treatment as prevention " programs worldwide , calling the preventive benefit of treatment a " game - changer " in the fight against @entity5			1
further compelling evidence that treatment as prevention works was provided by a @entity75 clinical trial ( @entity132 ) in may 2011			0
it found that immediate antiretroviral treatment of an @entity5 - infected person whose partner does not have @entity5 reduced @entity6 - related morbidity and mortality in the @entity5 - infected partner by 41 % and decreased @entity5 transmission to the sexual partner by 96 %			1
together , these results were instrumental in persuading the international community to renew the universal access pledge			2
@entity25 says that 12.2 million new hiv infections and 7.4 million hiv - related deaths could be averted between 2011 and 2020 if funding is scaled up to $ 24 billion annually by 2015			1
the dollars required are considerable , but -- considering that the @entity51 pledged $ 40 billion virtually on the spot for the @entity150 -- fully affordable			0
funding universal access is not just a moral and ethical obligation ; it is also highly cost - effective			0
the world 's most populous country is implementing a national treatment as prevention strategy to help @entity154 meet its goal of bringing @entity5 and @entity6 under control by 2015			1
under its program , @entity154 conducted nearly 67 million hiv tests in the first 10 months of this year			0
the global effort to combat @entity5 can not afford further delays , as the magnitude and impact of the pandemic grow relentlessly			0
today , 34 million people live with @entity5 and 7.6 million people require treatment			0
we continue to play catch - up			0
for every one person who starts @entity5 treatment , two become infected with @entity5			0
it is time to fully fund the @entity28 , so we can meet the universal access pledge and realize the goal of an @entity6 - free generation			1
millions of lives depend on it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			2

@entity186 : @entity25 announces hiv infections , @entity6 deaths down from peak
@entity184 : but these gains are *threatened* as @entity192 fails to meet funding obligations
@entity28 to fight @entity6 has deep shortfalls , he writes , is cutting new programs
wealthy nations must renew pledges , he says , or many more will die , become infected
