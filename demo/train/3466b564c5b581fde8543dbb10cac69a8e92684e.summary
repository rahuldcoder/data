@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 candidates for president outlined their foreign policy and national security visions in a debate saturday tackling issues that have largely taken a backseat in a presidential race shaped by the troubled economy			1
moderators pressed the candidates on a range of topics during the 90 - minute debate in @entity1 , including terrorism , @entity20 's nuclear capabilities , @entity21 , the war in @entity23 , the so - called " @entity25 " and foreign aid			1
the debate returned several times to the question of whether @entity30 military and intelligence personnel should be allowed to waterboard suspected terrorists , a tactic banned by president @entity34 shortly after he took office in 2009			1
the candidates were split on the matter			1
@entity44 gov. @entity43 , seeking to regain his footing after an embarrassing mental lapse during a debate earlier this week in @entity42 , forcefully defended the practice			1
" this is war , " @entity43 said			1
" that 's what happens in war			2
" former pizza executive @entity49 said of waterboarding : " i do n't see that as torture			1
i see it as an enhanced interrogation technique			2
" and @entity56 rep. @entity55 called the tactic " very effective " and said @entity34 " is allowing the @entity58 to run the @entity59			1
" but former @entity61 gov. @entity60 , a former diplomat who has positioned himself as the only candidate in the race with serious foreign policy experience , disagreed			2
so did libertarian - leaning @entity44 rep. @entity65			2
@entity66 : fact checking the @entity4 debate " we diminish our standing in the world and the values that we project which include liberty , democracy , human rights and open markets when we torture , " @entity60 said			0
" we should not torture			0
we dilute ourselves down like a whole lot of other countries and we lose that ability to project values that a lot of people in corners of this world are still relying on the @entity30 to stand up for			0
" former @entity89 gov. @entity88 did not address the matter during the debate held at @entity92 in @entity0 and sponsored by the @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95			0
but @entity88 aides said after the forum that he does not believe waterboarding is torture			2
his adviser @entity100 would not say whether the practice would be used in a @entity88 administration , saying decisions about " enhanced interrogation " will be up to the president			0
" he is not going to spell out what he would employ , " @entity100 told @entity2			0
@entity88 embraced several hawkish positions and said military forces should be able to target and kill @entity30 citizens fighting alongside enemies overseas , even without a trial			0
@entity112 was also in the sights of several candidates			2
five things we learned from saturday 's @entity4 debate @entity43 harshly accused the @entity112 government and intelligence services of knowingly harboring terrorists and said the @entity30 should stop sending billions of dollars in aid money to the country			1
he went further , saying financial aid to every country should be zeroed out and re-evaluated			0
that would go for @entity126 , too , @entity43 said -- though he clarified that @entity126 remains a staunch @entity30 ally and would continue to receive funding " at some substantial level			1
" former house speaker @entity130 criticized @entity112 in harsh terms and agreed with @entity43 's proposal to vastly reduce the amount of federal money allocated for foreign governments			1
" you ought to start off at zero and say , explain to me why i should give you a penny , " @entity136 said			0
former @entity141 sen. @entity140 , though , said the administration needs to engage @entity112 because it has nuclear weapons that could fall into the wrong hands under a different regime			0
" so we ca n't be indecisive about whether @entity112 is our friend , " @entity140 said			0
" they must be our friend , and we must engage them as friends			0
