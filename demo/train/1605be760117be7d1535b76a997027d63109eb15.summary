@entity1 , @entity0 -- a blossoming of cinematic creativity has swept @entity5 in recent years , bringing about a second golden age of film			1
@entity9 's latest movie " @entity10 " stars @entity11 ( left ) and was in competition at @entity13			2
in @entity5 , the renaissance marks a return to form for a cinematic tradition that was prolific and highly successful until creativity was stifled by a succession of military regimes that began with the ascendancy of @entity21 in the 1940s			2
a revival occurred after the country returned to democracy in 1983 as filmmakers focused on life under the military dictatorship -- @entity31 's " @entity30 " ( 1985 ) won an @entity29			1
but an economic malaise ensued , turning off the taps to film financing			2
an economic boom in the 1990s quickly turned unstable , resulting in a crippling financial crisis earlier this decade that plunged @entity5 into its worst recession ever			2
out of the chaos , a new group of @entity5 filmmakers emerged			1
the leaders of the so - called " @entity42 " have become critical contributors to the wider latin american film movement that has captivated international critics and audiences alike			1
what 's fueling @entity42 ? @entity5 's economy has recovered remarkably since its collapse in 2001 , and the national film institute , @entity50 ( @entity50 ) , has been keen to foster the industry 's development			1
the combination of cheap production costs and a flourishing artistic community has made @entity56 a hub of creativity			1
already one of the most cosmopolitan cities in @entity61 , the city is attracting everyone from local bohemians to big @entity65 names			1
@entity66 , the most recent notable to tap into the vibrant scene , opened an @entity5 unit of his zoetrope production company last year to film his @entity56 - set family drama " @entity71 , " which is anticipated to be released next year			1
what movies are creating buzz ? @entity9 's " @entity10 " about a woman who gives birth and raises her child in prison was nominated for the @entity74 at @entity13 this year			1
@entity9 is best known for his depiction of ordinary people			2

also in competition at @entity13 this year was " @entity88 " from the ever subtle @entity89			2
the film focuses on a woman 's guilt after a hit - and - run accident and like @entity95 's other works , offers up a dose of social criticism			2
@entity95 burst on the scene with her first movie " @entity103 " ( 2001 ) , winner of the @entity101 at the @entity102			2
@entity104 stirred debate with " xxy " ( 2007 ) , an exploration of adolescent sexuality centered around the life of a teenage hermaphrodite			2

no , it 's not a @entity149 casino but rather a neighborhood in @entity56 where many film and tv studios are based			1
a bohemian spirit distinguishes the neighborhood from its more polished cousin to the south , @entity156			0
once occupied by desolate factories and warehouses , the area is now humming with activity			0
an abundance of hip lounges , cafes and trendy restaurants keep the buzz going all day and through the night			1
how does @entity5 figure in the @entity167 film scene ? as the @entity170 has gained stride , filmmakers across the region have become more interested in collaborating on projects			1
the end of military dictatorships which ruled @entity167 in the 1970s and 1980s " created really interesting national cinemas that blossomed a little bit everywhere but also created a correlation between directors from different countries , " @entity173 director @entity172 told @entity2 earlier this year			1
@entity172 works frequently with @entity5 directors			1
he co-produced @entity9 's " @entity10 " and @entity183 's " sisters " ( 2005 )			0

is this boom going to run out of steam ? the renaissance in @entity5 has been building for some time , but it 's only just hitting its stride now			0
earlier films were mainly art house successes but now with the spotlight shining on @entity167 cinema , @entity5 films may start to connect more with international audiences			0
the country continues to attract productions , and there is a vast pool of talent that is being groomed to lead the next generation of auteurs			0
