the man - of - the - match became just the 11th player to score a hundred and take four wickets in a 50 - over international			0
opening batsmen @entity9 and @entity16 shared a competition - record first - wicket stand of 282 as @entity1 made 327 - 6 in front of a home crowd at the @entity21 stadium in @entity22			1

and both openers scored a century to set a new first in a @entity5 match , with @entity9 making 144 from 131 deliveries faced and @entity16 133 off 141 after @entity6 captain @entity34 won the toss and opted to field first			1
@entity16 was the first to fall near the end of the 45th over , becoming the first of four victims for fast bowler @entity40 , and @entity6 did well to restrict the 1996 champions to just another 45 runs from the final five overs			1
the @entity45 side made a solid 116 - run start in reply before world record - holder @entity48 broke the partnership , dismissing @entity51 for 35 as the first of three wickets in his final match in his home city before retiring after the tournament			1
the @entity57 then lost their last nine wickets for just 63 runs to be all out for 188 in 39 overs as @entity61 got rid of @entity62 ( 4 ) and opener @entity63 ( 80 ) before @entity9 had @entity65 ( 4 ) stumped by wicketkeeper @entity66			1
@entity9 found himself on a hat - trick after trapping @entity69 leg before wicket for 17 and then having @entity71 superbly caught at slip by @entity73 -- but the captain then spilled a similar chance off @entity76 from the next delivery			2
@entity9 also dismissed @entity78 lbw for a duck to end with the remarkable figures of 4 - 4 off three overs , while @entity48 bowled last man @entity40 to end with 3 - 34			2
" @entity9 has that magic touch with bat , ball and on the field , " @entity1 skipper @entity66 told reporters			1
