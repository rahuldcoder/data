-- able to scare up a few bucks ? just in time for @entity4 , the owners of the home made famous in the spooky 1970s film " @entity11 " are dramatically slashing the asking price on their @entity7 , @entity8 , colonial , which was used for exteriors in the film			1
the decision was n't triggered by demonic activity , however			0
apparently , another frightening " @entity15 " word was to blame			0
" my husband and i are getting a divorce , " said @entity16 , who bought the house with her husband @entity18 in 2001			1
" it 's not that the house is haunted or anything			1
we had wonderful times in that house			1
" the couple purchased the house for $ 795,000			1
originally listed last year at $ 1.45 million , the four - bedroom , three - bath home is now going for $ 955,000 -- a bargain , according to the agent			1
" if there were a curse on it , i would n't be in it , " joked @entity32 , the broker selling the 3,370 - square - foot residence			1
" it is what it is , a nice old stately home			0
" it was also the perfect place for @entity45 producers , who used it as a double for the real @entity49 house when shooting the 1979 movie			1
the film , based on @entity53 's 1977 best - seller , featured buzzing flies , ghostly eyes , blood pouring from the walls and a satanic voice warning a visiting priest to " get out ! " the film starred @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63			1
the story has its origins in the real - life tale of the @entity68 family , who purchased a house in @entity70 , @entity71 , in december 1975			1
the @entity73 ' reports of strange and horrific experiences became the heart of the book and film			1
the " @entity49 " franchise has since churned out an ample supply of sequels over the past 30 years , from a 3d version to a 2005 vehicle for @entity83			1
@entity18 's waterfront homestead , built in 1920 , is nowhere near the @entity73 ' old haunt -- about 100 miles and a state line away -- and is anything but scary			0
spread out over half an acre , it boasts a furnished basement , a lounge in the attic , hardwood floors and a two - car garage			1
there 's also a pool and a dock			0
" the property alone , being on that river , you have that southern exposure , it 's just a beautiful home , " said @entity32			0
how can the price be reduced a half - million dollars in only a year ? nothing suspicious about it : @entity32 said it 's a sign of the times			2
" the housing market has dropped tremendously , " she said			0
" that 's why people are coming down and buying homes in cash			0
they are n't making money in other investments			0
they are putting it in real estate			2
" this is n't the first time the price has been reduced			0
last year it dropped from $ 1.45 million to $ 1.35 million before the house was taken off the market in october			2
@entity18 rehung the " for sale " sign again in may , this time for $ 1.25 million			2
even then , the house drew little interest			2
@entity16 , 51 , who is in the middle of divorce proceedings after 33 years of marriage , said the house was appraised this summer for $ 1.1 million , but the judge told her and her husband they had to lower the price			1
which is why it 's now at $ 955,000 , she said			0
dozens of fans of the movie have appeared at her doorstep over the years , taking pictures and asking questions			2
" they were thrilled that they filmed the movie there , " @entity18 said			2
she also never sensed the house held any sinister secrets or apparitions			0
" i never felt anything , nothing whatsoever			0
i was just happy that we were buying the house because we saw the potential of it , " @entity18 said			0
" it 's not haunted , not at all			0
