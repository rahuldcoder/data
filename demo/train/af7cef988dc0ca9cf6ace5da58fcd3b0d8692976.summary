the @entity0 and @entity1 have long found themselves locked in a bitter cycle of escalating and deescalating tensions but the current cyber conflict may be especially hard to predict			1
@entity7 's @entity6 discussed this with @entity9 , a longtime @entity1 expert who has traveled to the country 17 times , senior fellow at the @entity0 - @entity14 at the @entity15 , and @entity7 's former senior asia correspondent , whose new book " the last pow " tells the story of the detention in @entity1 of 85 - year - old @entity0 tourist @entity21			1
there were reports tuesday that @entity1 's @entity24 was down , the disruption coming amid a growing war of words between the @entity0 and @entity1 over a cyberattack on @entity29			1
do you think the @entity0 disabled @entity1 's internet in retaliation for the @entity29 hack ? @entity9 : i 'm not convinced that the @entity0 government was behind the outage of the @entity37			1
the issue though is not whether it was or it was n't , the issue is what the @entity1 think it was			1
and i think it 's safe to assume , unless they themselves took their system offline for their own security -- which is not impossible -- they 'll be looking to respond			2
and if the @entity0 government actually took down @entity1 's @entity24 , that has its own implications			1
because if the @entity0 is officially engaging in cyberattacks then it implies @entity1 can do it to us , and everybody else can do it to everybody else			1
how does the @entity29 hacking saga complicate the situation between the @entity0 and @entity1 ? it 's a brave new world			1
we now have a situation where it 's entirely possible you 've got third - party hackers possibly helping the @entity1 in the original @entity29 hack , entirely possibly taking down the @entity37 , who are beyond the control of any government			1
and that makes it much , much harder to assess			2
part of what makes this dangerous is there are no agreed rules of the road in terms of cyber warfare in the way there are existing broad rules of the road for other security issues -- even if they are frequently violated			1
we 're absolutely in uncharted territory			2
and we 're in uncharted territory with pundits and the political class outraged in the @entity0 , and a new , unknown @entity37 leader in a system that we do n't understand the dynamics of very well			2
so that 's a worrisome combination			2
do you think @entity1 hacked @entity29 ? i do n't think the @entity86 would 've been given talking points that so explicitly blamed @entity1 if the @entity0 government did n't have very high confidence there was a @entity37 connection			1
now , whether or not the @entity1 explicitly gave the order and then farmed it out to teams of people in @entity95 or elsewhere , we do n't know enough about the decision - making process			1
how sophisticated are @entity1 's hacking capabilities ? we know they have a robust cyber capability			1
the @entity1 have devoted a lot of resources to giving themselves a lot of cyber capabilities			1
their broader security strategy has changed under @entity105 -- there 's a heavy focus on nuclear , cyber , and asymmetrical warfare capabilities , which enables them to reduce expenditures on a conventional military			1
@entity1 is the weaker , smaller power , and asymmetrical warfare is the approach of choice			1
the @entity1 are not suicidal			1
if they were responsible for the @entity29 attack , they targeted a specific company for a specific reason			2
it 's hard for me to imagine they 're going to take out the @entity0 power grid			0
how do the @entity0 and @entity1 view each other right now ? there 's layers and layers of hostility and mistrust			1
ever since the @entity130 , the @entity0 has seen @entity1 as this dangerous , threatening country and there 's always been concern when the @entity1 do something aggressive			1
in @entity1 , based on my 17 visits there , what comes through clearly is the reverse image			1
they feel under siege from the @entity0			0
they are convinced that the @entity0 goal is to do them in , to bring them down			0
they feel alone and beleaguered and they 're determined to keep their system afloat at all costs			0
the @entity37 strategy has always been brinksmanship -- tit for tat , you hit me , we hit back harder			0
part of their playbook is to make people think they are more extreme , they are crazier			0
a lot of it is rhetoric -- one of the challenges in situations like this is how to judge rhetoric			0
so when they threaten to attack the @entity168 and so on , you have to be careful not to take it literally			0
could this hacking crisis continue to escalate ? look , in 1976 , @entity37 soldiers crossed the demarcation line at @entity173 , killed two @entity0 with axes , and we did n't go to war			0
in 2010 , the @entity1 sank a @entity178 ship , killing dozens of @entity178 sailors , we did n't go to war			1
in 2010 when they shelled @entity182 island and killed @entity178 , we did n't go to war			0
we 're going to go to war because they hacked a movie production company ? i mean , you know , let 's have a little bit of perspective about it			0
that being said , this has created a kind of perfect storm of a real threat with cyberattacks , with implications in terms of what else might happen			1
there 's tremendous political pressure on the @entity203 administration to do something , even though the toolkit is somewhat limited			0
and what 's new here is this is the biggest crisis since @entity1 's youthful leader @entity105 came to power three years ago			2
how could this play out in the long run ? one of the likely responses is going to be accelerated moves toward a @entity37 nuclear test			0
lost in all the day to day headlines about @entity29 is the bigger strategic security picture which is the @entity1 are moving full speed ahead to enhance their nuclear capability			2
they 've got a plutonium program , they 've got a uranium program			0
each time they do a nuclear test they move further toward having the capability to miniaturize a warhead			0
once they can miniaturize a warhead they 've definitely got medium range missiles			0
they 've tested a long range missile , though it 's not clear how well it works			0
there is nothing happening to constrain that			0
what worries me is there has n't even been an attempt in the last couple of years to talk about this			0
without a diplomatic agreement for them to curtail or roll back their nuclear program , they will soon have in a period of time , it 's hard to judge how long , a larger nuclear arsenal , the ability to miniaturize a warhead , and a delivery system that can reach the continental @entity0			0
then it gets really scary			0
short of going to war and taking down the @entity37 regime , it 's very hard to see how you reverse that , unless you get back into some kind of negotiating process , and that seems very unlikely			0
there 's a big debate still over whether we should talk to them			0
my sense is the @entity1 still would very much like to talk to the @entity0			2
but the @entity203 administration has not been in the mood to do it			0
@entity203 has just done this major initiative with @entity270 , he 's been talking to @entity271 , but in security terms the @entity1 are scarier			1
unlike @entity271 , @entity1 's got the bomb and @entity274 uses overheated rhetoric which makes the @entity271 sound moderate in comparison			2
there 's very little evidence that sanctions work in terms of changing @entity1 's behavior to what the @entity0 wants			1
so that just makes the whole thing more dangerous			2

@entity9 : @entity290 has created a dangerous , *unpredictable* situation
there are no agreed upon rules of the road in terms of cyber warfare
@entity1 has *invested* *significantly* in its cyber warfare capabilities
