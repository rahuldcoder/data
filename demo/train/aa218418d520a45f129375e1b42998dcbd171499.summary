sometimes ordinary people can have an extraordinary impact on @entity4 politics			0
the new movie " @entity6 " recreates the grass - roots protests that resulted in the @entity8			1
in this riveting film , audiences get to see how average citizens have been able to push politicians to take action that they do n't have the courage to do on their own			0
the movie depicts president @entity16 as a leader who was extraordinarily hesitant , to the point of being hostile , toward proposing a voting rights bill			1
" the voting thing is going to have to wait , " @entity16 tells a frustrated @entity20 in one scene			1
" it ca n't wait , " @entity20 responds			0
the storyline of the movie revolves around a courageous group of civil rights activists who put their lives on the line when @entity30 was n't helping them until they convinced the president to send a bill to @entity33			1
after the violent response by police to the marchers , @entity16 finally listens to @entity20 , who had warned that he will be remembered as " saying ' wait ' and ' i ca n't			1
' " a controversy has opened up about the film , with a number of critics , including former members of the administration , pointing out that the movie offers a skewed portrayal of @entity16			1
he comes across as a president uninterested in voting rights and primarily focused on secret @entity49 surveillance of @entity20			0
the best place to look for some answers is in the historical archives			0
this is the first in a series of columns this month that i will be writing that explore some of the conversations in the @entity59 telephone recordings of president @entity16 — on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the @entity63 , the wide range of domestic programs enacted by the 89th @entity33 in 1965 and 1966 — to understand some of the lessons that these conversations offer us in today 's political world			1
by the time of his landslide election victory against @entity73 @entity72 @entity71 in 1964 , president @entity16 believed that @entity33 needed to pass a strong voting rights bill that would guarantee the ability of african - americans to register to vote and actually cast their choice on election day			1
for much of his life he had been opposed to the racial inequality of the @entity81 and the civil rights movement in the 1950s and early 1960s had further strengthened his belief in the necessity of federal legislation			1
in 1964 , @entity33 , with @entity16 's strong support , had passed the @entity87 , which ended racial segregation in public accommodations			1
president @entity16 did n't need any more grass - roots protests to convince him that voting rights legislation was necessary			1
this is one big thing the movie gets wrong , which has led some scholars , including the head of the @entity96 and former adviser @entity97 to rightly complain of how the film depicts him			0
indeed , the @entity59 tapes tell a very different story			0
only a month after his election victory , president @entity16 can be heard telling deputy attorney general @entity103 on december 14 , 1964 , that he should start crafting a strong piece of legislation that would create a " simple , effective " method to register african - americans to vote			2
over the next few months , @entity16 instructed @entity103 to conduct secret negotiations with @entity72 senate minority leader @entity109 to design the framework for a bill , which they would reach agreement on by early march			2
but the movie is correct in asserting that @entity16 disagreed with civil rights leaders on the timing ; he was not ready to actually propose a bill to @entity33			1
while @entity16 wanted a bill , he did n't feel he could deal with the issue until later in 1965			2
@entity16 feared that the time was not right			2
he sensed that he would n't be able to find enough support in the @entity59 and @entity122			0
@entity33 had just passed the @entity87 , he said , so another heated debate over race relations could tear the @entity125 ( then divided between @entity126 and liberal northerners ) apart			0
civil rights activists were unwilling to wait any longer			1
they believed that when @entity33 refused to act on major civil rights issues , always with the justification that the time was not yet right , the chances increased that the bill would never see the light of day			1
@entity20 liked to speak about the " fierce urgency of now , " by which he meant that it was intolerable to postpone resolving the fundamental issues of the day			0
in @entity4 politics , delay was often the way major legislation was left to die			0
@entity16 , who for years had seen the kind of trickery @entity146 conservatives were capable of when it came to civil rights , could not be moved by logic			1
during a conversation with @entity20 on january 15 , 1965 , the president made it clear to the civil rights leader that he was determined on moving forward on a number of other domestic issues , such as education , @entity157 , poverty and more ( all of which , @entity16 reminded him , would be enormously helpful to @entity161 )			1
in @entity16 's view , they had to get the bills passed before what he called the " vicious forces " concentrated in @entity33 to block them			1
@entity20 tried to appeal to @entity16 's practical side , highlighting how the @entity161 - @entity4 vote in the @entity81 would create a powerful coalition , along with moderate whites , in a " @entity81			1
" @entity16 would have none of this			2
@entity16 says to @entity20 that he and the civil rights movement needed to help him build support for legislation by talking about the kind of rights violations that were common in the @entity81			1
but he was not prepared to send anything to @entity33			0
the proposal would have to wait			0
this is the moment when the civil rights activists stepped in			1
@entity20 had warned @entity16 that if @entity33 did not take up this issue , activists would force them to do so			2
the civil rights movement mobilized in @entity6 , @entity185 , one of the most notoriously racist cities in the @entity81 , to organize protests in favor of voting rights			1
the violence the activists encountered when they were viciously attacked by sheriff @entity193 , an ardent racist who dressed in military garb and wore a button that said " @entity198 ! " and his men was shocking			0
as @entity16 watched and read the news , he became convinced he might have to take action sooner than he thought			2
the protests culminated with the historic march from @entity6 to @entity205 over the @entity206 on march 7			1
the violence that protesters encountered over the @entity206 , on a day that would be remembered as " @entity6 , " shocked legislators and the president into concluding that legislation was needed immediately			2
as rep. @entity217 , then @entity214 leader , whose skull was cracked by the police , recalled , " they came toward us , beating us with nightsticks , bullwhips , tramping us with horses , releasing the tear gas			0
i was hit in the head by a state trooper with a nightstick			0
my legs went from under me			0
i thought i was going to die			0
i thought i saw death			0
" on march 10 , after asking if the white preacher @entity229 , who had been attacked by white racists after having participated in another march in favor of voting rights , was dead , @entity16 admitted to @entity103 that he was " anxious " the public would see him as a " @entity146 president " who was tacitly supporting racist law officers allied with the forces against the civil rights movement			1
he delivered a dramatic address to a joint session of @entity33 that brought @entity20 to tears			0
the activists had achieved their goal			0
their marches , and the violent response by the white police , had pressured @entity16 into taking up this issue before @entity33 had finished its work on all the other proposals			1
in the days that followed the protests , @entity16 worked hard to move the bill and to contain the forces of white racism			2
@entity16 called @entity185 gov. @entity257 , who was allowing this violence to take place and doing little to establish order , a " treacherous son of a bitch " when speaking to former @entity262 gov. @entity261 on march 18			2
on march 24 , 1965 , @entity103 ( who had been appointed attorney general in february ) felt confident that the civil rights forces were pleased with the administration and the activists were subsiding , though he warned the president that he did n't want to give the impression " because we get this voting bill quickly			1
we can all turn our attention to something else and forget about civil rights			1
because they 'll continue to raise some hell			0
" @entity103 and @entity16 were clearly aware of the impact that the grass - roots would have			2
the @entity122 passed the bill on may 26 and the @entity59 passed it on july 19 , 1965			0
@entity16 signed the bill on august 6			2
in the current era , when @entity33 seems so broken , @entity6 is an important way to remember that , ultimately , real political change is in the hands of citizens			2
leaders , even those who can be bold and who actually want to get things done usually tend to hesitate on tackling controversial issues , often paralyzed by the pressures of political necessity and opposition			0
without citizen pressure , the status quo usually wins even when there is a president who supports reform			0
but the status quo did n't win in @entity6			2
civil rights activists made sure their leaders took action			1
they gave @entity16 the political space he needed to maneuver			0
the result of their efforts transformed @entity4 history			0
within only a few months , almost 250,000 new @entity161 - @entity4 voters were registered to vote with the help of federal protection -- and millions more would follow			0

new film ' @entity6 ' tells story of violent *repression* of civil rights protests , leading to enactment of @entity8
@entity320 says the film gets most of the story right but misrepresents @entity16 's role
