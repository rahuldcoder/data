@entity0 -- the @entity2 is proposing new rules aimed at limiting the amount of carbon pollution coming from new power plants			1
the standards , which would set separate limits for natural gas and coal power plants , are being called the first uniform national limits for new plants			1
" power plants are the single largest sources of carbon pollution , " epa administrator @entity13 said in remarks prepared for delivery at the @entity16 in @entity0			1
" new power plants can minimize their carbon emissions by taking advantage of modern technologies			1
these technologies offer them a clear path forward , today and in the long - term			0
" new coal power plants and small natural gas plants would be limited to 1,100 pounds of @entity30 emissions per megawatt - hour			1
larger natural gas plants would be limited to one thousand pounds a megawatt - hour			2
these restrictions are slightly looser than a set first proposed in 2012			0
@entity13 said the new proposal factors in public feedback from public comments received last year			0
existing power plants are exempt from the proposed carbon regulation , but @entity13 said regulations on those plants will be proposed in june			1
sen. @entity41 , a @entity42 who represents coal - rich @entity43 , criticized the administration as trying to hold the coal industry to " impossible standards " " never before has the federal government forced an industry to do something that is technologically impossible			1
forcing coal to meet the same emissions standards as gas when experts know that the required technology is not operational on a commercial scale makes absolutely no sense and will have devastating impacts to the coal industry and our economy , " he said in a written statement			2
@entity13 said the @entity2 has a history of pollution standards driving technological development			2
" the old rules may say we ca n't protect our environment and promote economic growth at the same time , but in @entity70 , we 've always used new technologies , we 've used science , we 've used research and development and discovery to make the old rules obsolete , " @entity13 said			0
the president and ceo of the @entity79 also had harsh words for the proposal			0
" the regulation announced today by @entity2 effectively bans coal from @entity70 's power portfolio , leaving new power plants equipped with even the most efficient and environmentally advanced technologies out in the cold , " said @entity82 , asserting that the @entity2 is " recklessly gambling with the nation 's energy and economic future			1
" he said standards should be based on the best technology available today			2
an @entity2 official briefing the media on the new clean air proposals friday said that if they are finalized , the method of recouping costs associated with the new regulations would be determined by the industry			0
when pressed , the @entity2 official refused to say if the increased costs would be passed on to consumers			0
the standards will be open for public comment for 60 days , during which time the agency said , it plans to hold public hearings			0
@entity109 panel says it 's more certain that humans drive global warming @entity1 's @entity112 contributed to this report .			0
