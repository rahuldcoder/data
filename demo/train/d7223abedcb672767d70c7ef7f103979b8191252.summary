@entity0 -- the news that @entity3 , the @entity4 leader of @entity5 , is now confirmed to have been killed in a @entity7 drone strike in @entity9 's tribal region along the border with @entity11 further underlines that the terrorist group that launched the 9/11 attacks is now more or less out of business			1
under president @entity16 , @entity7 drone strikes have killed 15 of the most important players in @entity5 , according to a count maintained by the @entity19 ( a nonpartisan think tank where i am a director )			1
similarly , president @entity21 also authorized drone strikes that killed 16 important @entity5 operatives in @entity9 while he was in office			2
as a result , according to senior @entity26 counterterrorism officials , there now remains only one leader of any consequence in @entity5 and that is @entity31 , the tetchy @entity32 surgeon who became the head of the group following the death of its founder , @entity36 , in a @entity39 raid in @entity9 in may 2011			1
@entity31 , presumably , is keenly aware of the fate of so many of his longtime colleagues in @entity5			2
he will be expending considerable energy not to end up on the business end of a missile fired by a @entity7 drone if he , too , is hiding in the @entity9 tribal regions where the drone strikes have been concentrated			1
meanwhile , @entity31 faces an almost impossible task to follow through on @entity5 's main mission : attacking the @entity26 , or failing that , one of its close allies			1
@entity5 has n't conducted a successful attack in the @entity54 since the bombings on @entity57 's transportation system on july 7 , 2005 , and of course , the group has n't succeeded in attacking the @entity26 for more than a decade			2
there are , however , @entity5 's regional affiliates still to contend with			1
the most virulent of those is the @entity65 - based @entity64			0
it was @entity64 that tried to bring down @entity67 over @entity68 on christmas day 2009 using a @entity70 recruit who had secreted a hard - to - detect bomb in his underwear , and it was @entity64 that smuggled bombs in printer cartridges onto cargo planes bound for the @entity26 in october 2010			0
last month came news that a spy had penetrated @entity64 and had retrieved a new generation of underwear bomb that the group 's bomb maker had apparently recently designed to bring down a commercial jet			0
but all of @entity64 's plots to bring down planes have had one thing in common : they failed			0
some might say that that while @entity5 the organization may be basically dead , its ideology continues to thrive and to inspire " lone wolves " to attack the @entity26			2
in fact , lone wolves inspired by jihadist ideology have managed to kill a total of 17 @entity26 in the @entity26 since 9/11 , according to a tally maintained by the @entity19			0
meanwhile , 54 americans are reported to be killed every year by lightning , according to the @entity99			0
in other words , to the average @entity26 , lightning is about 30 times more deadly than jihadist terrorism			0
few @entity26 harbor irrational fears about being killed by a lightning bolt			0
@entity3 's death on monday should remind them that fear of @entity5 in its present state is even more irrational .			1

@entity5 's number two leader was killed in a @entity7 drone strike
@entity113 says it shows that the terrorist organization is *effectively* out of business
he says the only senior leader left is @entity31 , the successor to @entity36
@entity121 : fearing present day @entity5 is more irrational than fearing a lightning strike
