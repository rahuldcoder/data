@entity0 -- the days of @entity2 just making your favorite gadgets are over			2
the company is about to enter the payments services arena taking on @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and others in offering a way to allow you to pay using their system			0
one of @entity2 's big plays at its event in @entity0 was a fingerprint scanner for the newest iphones , which will allow shoppers to ditch the magnetic strip when they shop in store			1
but the initial rollout of @entity24 , in october , is only in the @entity25 @entity27 and @entity28 banking systems are already embracing contactless payment , so it 's strange @entity2 has chosen to focus on its home turf of @entity25 first rather than push for an immediate global release			1
it means customers outside of the @entity25 wo n't yet benefit from the new features , and puts @entity2 in a situation whereby if it does n't move quickly , customers will be happy enough with a card that has the same powers instead			1
@entity24 emulates your wallet digitally , and will work with a number of retail stores and banks in the @entity25 to allow you to pay with your phone , or in the future your watch			1
but rather than gear a system towards skimming off the top , or trying to understand users ' buying behavior , @entity2 is -- presumably -- making the move to sell more devices			2
@entity2 was very clear in telling those that watched its event that it wo n't track or store information about where you shop , what you buy , or how much those purchases cost			0
@entity2 's pitch was about empowering the banks and stores			2
its decision to roll out in the @entity25 first could be because the need is n't so great elsewhere			0
in the @entity69 , many banks now offer contactless payment cards as standard , while @entity71 , rolled out across @entity27 some time ago , has also been incredibly successful in reducing over the counter fraud			1
it could also be about @entity27 's limit on contactless payments			1
trying to explain that you can only use your phone for small purchases is a complicated sell and one that means you are n't likely to ditch your bank cards altogether			0
in the @entity25 , there is no limit			0
but will @entity2 's delay in rolling the service out elsewhere allow others to capitalize on the gap in the market ? having seen @entity2 's new system up close , it is unlikely			1
however , @entity2 's decision to finally jump into the @entity93 tap - to - pay arena now legitimizes the experience and will only accelerate the adoption of the technology			1
is an idea that @entity99 shares			0
@entity100 , the company 's chief digital officer , said @entity2 's entry to the market represents a critical piece of the mobile payments jigsaw			2
he called it a " pivotal moment " for digital payments , demonstrating the " momentum behind mobile and contactless services			0
" it might have taken seven years to get here , but he said @entity2 's decision to enter the market " reflects the scale of opportunity that exists in digital payments today			0
" @entity2 's support will drive usage of contactless services around the world and he anticipates what he calls a " halo effect " benefiting all mobile payments players			2
that might sound an exaggeration , but so far contactless payments have very much been a chicken and egg scenario			0
companies have waited for mobile phone manufacturers to get on board , and mobile phone makers have delayed getting on board because of a lack of infrastructure			0
@entity2 clearly believes that in the @entity25 at least , that tipping point has been reached			2
with the introduction of @entity136 last year , @entity2 had the right technology in place to make it a decent proposition to the banks on the security front			0
and with @entity2 now involved , @entity27 and @entity28 banks will no doubt be knocking on the @entity0 - based company 's door begging to be involved			1

@entity2 introduced its @entity148 - linked payment system at its @entity148 *launch*
but @entity24 's rollout is initially only in the @entity25 , despite demand in @entity27 and @entity28
@entity156 says one reason might be @entity27 's established use of contactless payment
but , now @entity2 is involved , the industry will likely get a big boost
