@entity0 , the absolute dictator of @entity1 , made a very rare trip outside the protection of his own borders this past august , albeit on a heavily armored private train			1
the reason for the trip was a meeting with @entity9 president @entity8 to talk about forming deeper trade and labor alliances between the two countries			2
this would all seem quite normal and boring if it were n't for the fact that a ) nothing is ever normal when it comes to @entity1 and , b ) @entity18 happened to also be in the @entity19 at the exact same time as @entity0			1
but we were there to track down a different kind of @entity1 in @entity23 : slaves			2
we had heard through freelance journalist @entity25 that @entity1 was outsourcing its labor force to work in @entity23 as a way to generate much needed hard currency for @entity0 's cash - strapped regime			1
he reported that camps built to actually look like miniature @entity1 villages peppered the remote regions of @entity9 's @entity33 and @entity23			1
he also reported on the lengthy terms of their labor " contracts " and insanely harsh working conditions			0
so we sent a vice crew along with @entity25 to see if we could find some of these camps and talk to some of the @entity1 working there			0
most of the camps are very inaccessible so we spent a lot of time on the @entity44 to get to the small towns we would use as bases for excursions deep into the forest , looking for work crews			0
when we finally found the @entity1 loggers , their stories were astounding : 10 - year labor requirements , living and working out in the bush , dickensian working conditions , squalid living quarters , inedible food and the majority of their wages garnished and sent back to @entity1 to " help the quality of life there improve			0
" it was hard to believe that labor camps of this sort still exist in @entity23 in 2011 , but we saw them with our own eyes			1
most of the workers were over 40 , meaning that they likely had families back in the home country			2
so if they tried to escape ( many still do ) the @entity1 government could punish them by sending them to concentration camps or enslaving their families in other work camps			0
see the rest of @entity77 at @entity18 when we found out that @entity0 was in the same region making deals for even more of these types of labor arrangements we knew that we had to show what was going on : a dictator trying to sell more of his people , to make more money , to build more nuclear weapons , that he can use to blackmail the @entity88 into giving @entity1 more aid , thus enabling him to maintain his regime			1
and this more than anything exemplifies the absurdity of the modern condition			0
or at least the bull goose lunacy that is going on in @entity9 's @entity33 .			0
