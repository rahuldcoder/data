-- renewable energy is generating a lot of political heat			1
the bankruptcy of solar - panel manufacturer @entity7 , after a half billion dollar loan from the federal government , has set off a hot debate on @entity10			1
and a group of @entity13 - based solar companies are demanding 100 % tariffs on imports of @entity17 solar panels			2
they charge that @entity17 unfairly competes by subsidizing the @entity17 industry , which @entity20 resolutely denies			0
all this , however , is occurring against a larger backdrop			0
around the world renewable energy is going through a rebirth			1
it is becoming a big business			1
it is also becoming a more established part of the world 's overall energy supply			2
last year , $ 120 billion was spent to install renewable electricity generation worldwide			2
yet it is still a relatively small business compared to the overall energy business , and one that still faces big challenges in getting to scale on a global basis			1
the position of renewable energy is very different from where it was even a decade ago			1
the modern renewable industry -- wind , solar , and other forms of energy -- was born with a great deal of excitement in the 1970s and early 1980s			1
but the early hopes soon crashed on the harsh reality of lower energy prices and the fact that the technologies were still immature and not yet ready for primetime			2
the subsequent years were tough			0
for many people in the renewable business , the late 1980s and 1990s are remembered as the " valley of death " as the pioneers struggled to hang on , often by their fingernails			1
but around the beginning of this century , several things came together to breathe new life into the field			0
now , it was not only concerns about energy security and general environmental protection , which had stimulated the first boom			2
the rise of climate change as a central issue in energy policy drove governments to much more actively promote carbon - free electricity			1
the @entity78 's energy policy is now predicated on using renewables to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 80 % by 2050			1
the other is the rapidly growing energy needs of emerging market countries such as @entity17 and @entity84			2
they have turned to renewables as part of their future supply			2
as a senior official in @entity20 told me , @entity17 used to regard the fierce winds in its northwest as a " natural disaster , " but now they are prized as a " very precious resource			0
" but it would be a mistake , as is sometimes said , to assume that @entity17 has embraced renewables as the only solution			2
in order to meet its rapidly growing needs for energy , @entity17 is pursuing all options -- oil and coal and natural gas and nuclear power , as well as renewables			1
over the last decade , growing support by governments for renewable energy has been critical to its development			1
@entity112 and @entity113 took the lead in repowering renewables with a new system of electricity rates that blended the higher cost of renewable power into the overall price			1
as a result , consumers do not see the direct cost of the renewables when it comes time to pay their bills			1
in the @entity13 , both federal and state governments provide tax incentives and subsidies that have been critical in stimulating demand , with the aim of increasing output and reducing costs			2
moreover , an increasing number of states now require that a certain percentage of electricity must be renewable -- the so - called " renewable portfolio standards			0
" the most aggressive of all is @entity140 , where about 15 % of electricity today is renewable			0
earlier this year , gov. @entity143 signed a new law requiring that a third of @entity140 's electricity be renewable by 2020			0
this is considered extremely ambitious , especially given the state 's difficult economic situation and a 12 % unemployment rate			0
renewables need to overcome two big hurdles			1
one is that the sun does not shine all the time , and wind does not blow all the time			0
as the renewable share of electric power goes up , this " intermittency " will be a bigger concern			1
one solution is more use of natural gas as renewables ' " partner " -- to generate electricity at those times when the sun and wind are off duty			1
another -- the subject of much research -- is to find some way to store electricity in large scale			0
success there would be a major breakthrough for renewable energy the other challenge is costs			1
but , without direct incentives and subsidies , renewables are still generally more expensive than competing sources			0
a " great bubbling " of innovation is at work all across the energy spectrum , conventional as well as alternatives			0
in the case of renewables , much of the focus is on cost reduction			1
and certainly the technological advance is evident			0
a wind turbine today is a far larger and more sophisticated machine than a wind turbine of the 1980s , and it may produce as much as a hundred times more electricity			0
the costs of solar energy continue to come down , and many of the new approaches under development and in the lab are aimed at further cost reductions			1
to achieve big impact , however , renewables still need to establish that they are competitive at large scale			1
and they are not there yet			0
indeed , they have run into an unexpected new challenge			0
this comes from the recent appearance of large volumes of low - cost natural gas , known as shale gas , which is extremely competitive as a fuel for electricity generation			0
that adds to the cost pressures on renewable energy			1
in the first half of 2011 , renewables constituted 9 % of total @entity13 energy			1
but over 80 % of that renewable energy comes from three sources -- hydropower , which has been around a long time ; wood , which has been around even longer ; and biofuels , primarily ethanol in gasoline			1
wind and solar are small , but they are growing			1
wind today constitutes over 3 % of @entity13 electricity			0
@entity242 is much , much smaller			0
as costs go down , more solar will come into use around the world			0
solar panels will proliferate both on rooftops and in generating stations			0
as much as 6 % of the capacity installed between now and 2025 could be solar			0
but , in total , because of the huge size of the global electric power industry , it would only constitute 1 % of total electricity supply			0
in other words , wind and solar have much ground to cover , and it will take time			2
but they have been growing fast , and in the past few years , wind has been one of the main choices of many utilities for new generation			0
wind - generated electricity today in the @entity13 is 20 times greater than it was a decade ago			0
overall , renewables are destined to grow			1
there will be cycles , and hills and valleys to cross -- but no more " valley of death			0
" renewable will be part of a growing global business that will be measured in hundreds of billions of dollars			2
but how big a role will they have in keeping on our lights and powering our computers and all the other proliferating gadgets on which we depend ? that will be determined by a mix of government policy , technological advance , the world 's energy needs -- and by sheer economics			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity293 .			2

@entity293 : @entity7 failure does *n't* mean renewable energy is in trouble
he says renewables have become big business because of demand , climate change
solar and wind are still *negligible* *contributors* , but they are destined to grow , he says
@entity293 : renewables must overcome cost issues , *problem* of " intermittency "
