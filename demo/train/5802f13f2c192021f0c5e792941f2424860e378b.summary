-- a report from @entity3 researchers published monday says there is not enough sound evidence to support routine screening of children for autism , but several autism experts are questioning the paper 's conclusions			1
the article , published in the journal @entity14 , is based on a review of existing studies			0
currently , the @entity17 -- which publishes the journal -- recommends that doctors screen children for autism during regular checkups at the ages of 18 and 24 months			1
the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) estimates that 1 in 110 children has some form of autism , a handful of different neuro - developmental disorders that cause mild to severe social , communication and behavioral problems			2
monday 's report questions whether screening for autism is the right approach			1
" good screening tools and efficacious treatment [ for autism ] is lacking , " it says , adding that " none of the autism screening tests currently available has been shown to be able to fulfill the properties of accuracy			1
" the report 's authors are cerebral palsy experts at @entity41 in @entity42			1
but several leading autism experts -- who diagnose , treat and study children with autism -- said they were puzzled and concerned by the new report 's conclusions			1
" by screening for autism at an early age , children are able to begin intervention as soon as possible , " said @entity48 , chief science officer for the @entity50 advocacy group			2
" studies have shown that early intervention results in significant increases in cognitive and language abilities , and adaptive behavior , and gives children the best chance for a positive outcome			0
" dr. @entity63 , a developmental pediatrician and the director of the autism center at the @entity66 , said the study goes completely " against the experience in this field " in which experts have said early intervention or therapy can yield the most benefits for a child later in life			2
" i have never , ever met a family that regretted being told their child may have symptoms -- not a single family , " she said			0
if a diagnosis of autism is later found to be inaccurate , the child is n't harmed by the therapy given in the interim , she said			0
but @entity86 - @entity63 said she 's met thousands of parents whose children were diagnosed at an older age " who wished they were listened to sooner			2
" dr. @entity92 , medical director of the @entity93 , echoed @entity86 - @entity63 's concerns , saying the report 's conclusions seem to negate well established research and recommendations from people who treat children with autism , including the @entity17			1
more research is needed , he said , but just because all the necessary research has n't been done yet , it " does not negate the benefit of screening			0
" dr. @entity105 , who chaired the academy 's 2006 committee that recommended the screenings at 18 and 24 months , said the conclusions in monday 's report overlooked significant benefits to screening			1
doctors are also identifying problems beyond autism , including a wide range of developmental disorders , he said			0
@entity105 , the director of the @entity118 at the @entity119 in @entity120 , acknowledged that screening tools are n't perfect , but noted that doctors combine them with continuous surveillance			1
" we are hoping that the combination can then overcome any of the limits of the tests or surveillance			0
the combination is better than either one of them , " he said , adding that some newer studies , not cited in the @entity3 study , suggest that " it does look like we 're on the right track			0
" despite the apparent criticisms of screening in monday 's article , study author dr. @entity135 said he and his co-authors were not specifically referring to " the surveillance that is happening in doctors ' offices " at 18 and 24 months			1
they were recommending against a population - wide screening program that would require screening every child at a certain age level for autism , he said			0
nobody is conducting such a study at this time in the @entity150			0
results from a @entity153 study of that nature published last month in the @entity155 suggested 1 in 38 children had autism -- a much higher number than previously believed			0
some experts questioned the accuracy of those results , which were based on screening of 55,000 12 - year - old children in @entity153 , suggesting that the screening may have picked up other developmental delays , not just autism			1
last month , the @entity22 told @entity0 it was considering a total population study of autism , but no such study is currently underway			0
@entity135 said he and his colleagues did not include the @entity153 study in their analysis , but he said it showed " exactly why we wrote the paper			0
" he said he and his co-authors based their suggestions on what they learned from children with cerebral palsy , and that his ultimate goal is to " find the children who truly have autism and find ways to help them			2
" screening is n't the only issue touched on in monday 's paper			2
the article also finds " little support for the effectiveness for speech and language therapy for people with autism , " argues that " applied behavior intervention did not significantly improve the cognitive outcomes of children " and says that " screening is pointless , and almost certainly unethical			1
" @entity193 , director of media relations for the @entity17 , pointed to the academic journal 's disclaimer , which says statements and opinions in the articles it publishes " are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the @entity17			1
" but several autism specialists said they feared the theoretical questions the article poses would turn back the clock to a time when parents ' concerns about their childrens ' development were n't heard			0
@entity212 said monday 's report completely leaves out studies that have shown benefits for children in cognitive and social developments			2
he cites a study published by @entity220 and @entity221 , which found giving toddlers as young as 18 months old intensive therapy by trained specialists and their parents , can effectively improve the child 's iq , social interaction and ability to communicate			2
@entity212 called that study a " landmark ( clinical ) trial " and said he was surprised the @entity3 researchers did not include it			0
manning - @entity63 , who is also a member of the @entity17 , said the study could be misinterpreted by some , " especially insurance companies , " which may decide they do n't have to pay for costly , lengthy autism therapies if a study says that " efficacious treatments are lacking			1
" but @entity135 said the study 's authors want to " help improve the outcome for the children 's lives			1
" " i would hope our debate would lead to an action , " he said .			0
