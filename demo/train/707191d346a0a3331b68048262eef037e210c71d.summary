@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 already had seen the lock - picking videos on @entity5			0
but it was a different thing entirely for the 13 - year - old puzzle - lover to get lessons in lock picking and computer hacking at an event sanctioned by adults			1
the world 's largest gathering of computer hackers -- @entity16 , which is happening this weekend at the @entity17 in @entity0 -- held its first - ever hacking classes for kids this year , at an event appropriately called @entity21			1
sessions in hacking were designed for kiddos ages 8 to 16			1
a common parent 's reaction to something this might be : they 're teaching them what ? ! but hear these hackers out			1
take @entity3 's uncle , @entity35 , a computer security professional in @entity37 , @entity38 , who brought his nephew to these training sessions because he already was fascinated with games and coding			1
( he actually has written his own computer game , called " @entity45 , " in which players " try to build as many buildings as you can while avoiding enemies , " he said			1
) " you can watch lock - picking videos on @entity5 , but where do you hear the ethical side of this ? " said @entity35 , the uncle			0
" he added : " i would rather someone learn in a controlled environment			0
they 're going to learn it anyway			0
" @entity3 , the video game - writing nephew , sat attentively in the second row of a small classroom on saturday , fiddling with a @entity63 during sessions with titles like " secrets revealed , " " meet the @entity59 " and " @entity67			0
" that last class title is a bit misleading , since instructor - hacker @entity70 focused more on non-technical hacking -- looking at people 's laptops over their backs in airports ; picking locks with toilet paper rolls and pen caps ; and digging social security numbers out of corporate trash bins -- instead of actual search - engine hacking			2
@entity70 went to great lengths to remind the kids in attendance that the point of the class was to teach them what bad guys might be doing -- and how to avoid breaches in their own security or privacy			1
" do n't let me catch you guys stealing toilet paper and breaking locks , " he said			0
" if you do , it 's not my fault			2
" @entity3 said he would only pick a lock if his family got locked out of their own house or car			0
that 's happened before , he said , so that skill might be handy			2
" our family has had some trouble with locks , " he said , smiling			0
" let 's say the younger ones love playing with the key and slipping them under the door			2
" in the " meet the @entity59 " session , representatives from @entity115 , the @entity116 , the @entity117 and the @entity118 told the kids they were smart to pick up hacking skills early because the government needs employees who can hack			2
several kids raised their hands to ask about hacking as a career path			2
part of the potential confusion about @entity21 comes from the very term " hacker , " which people here use to refer to anyone who has the skills needed to modify computer software and hardware			1
some hackers extend the domain further , to locks and such			2
those skills could be used for criminal activity , but quite a few @entity16 attendees are actually computer security professionals -- the " good guys " trying to make the @entity145 less vulnerable to attacks by computer criminals			1
still , all this talk about malicious hacking made 10 - year - old @entity150 a bit nervous			2
" i 'm getting a locker next year , " he said after one of the class sessions			0
he 's about to start middle school			0
" i thought it was cool , but now i 'm afraid someone might open it			0
" @entity150 said he 'd deal with this by keeping any valuables , which he defined as anything with his address on it ; textbooks ; and his @entity166 e-reader , which he apparently carries around all the time , out of that school locker			0
the @entity21 event also included a competition , where kids went around the hacker conference trying to break codes and solve puzzles			1
@entity175 , 10 , made up one - half of a team called " @entity178 , " a name she says is " weird " but went with because the boy who was her partner chose it			0
" you have to , like , find people , and it 's really hard because they 're all over the place , " she said of one piece of the challenge which required her to search out hackers			1
her dad , @entity190 , from @entity191 , @entity192 , said it 's cool for kids to get a chance to see how the technology and video games they use all the time actually work			1
ultimately , it will make the kids safer , he said , especially in this age of social networking , when the collective memory of the @entity145 has no expiration date			1
" you 're building up your reputation and it 's not going to go away			0
if you do bad things , that 's going to stick with you , " he said			0
he added : " you can say , ' oh , we do n't want to hear how this ( hacking ) stuff works and that 's scary ... but it 's really important kids know how to protect themselves			1
