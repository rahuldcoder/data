-- the cell phone video stutters as it records the movement of soldiers and @entity5 militia on the streets from an upstairs window			1
a whispered commentary describes the scene			0
another video shows vehicles riddled with bullet holes , shattered apartments , glass shards and concrete lumps mixed with patches of blood			0
in yet another , protesters flee as heavy - caliber weapons fire ricochets off buildings			0
all are scenes purportedly filmed in recent days in @entity24 , @entity5 's third - largest city			1
security forces have sealed off entire neighborhoods ; others are blocked by barricades thrown up by protesters			0
at night , street rallies take place in areas " liberated " from government control			0
the many videos uploaded on social media sites , as well as residents ' accounts , suggest some neighborhoods in @entity24 -- at the heart of opposition to the regime of president @entity42 -- are beginning to resemble @entity43 at the height of the @entity46 civil war			1
that resistance is now becoming more organized and armed			1
@entity49 deserters calling themselves the @entity49 are helping with the defense of districts opposed to the regime			2
some opposition activists say it 's time for the international community to declare a no - fly zone over @entity5 , as it did in @entity57 , to blunt the regime 's overwhelming military advantage			1
( there is no sign that @entity63 powers are willing to do this			0
) confrontations are also taking on sectarian overtones that could lead to a wider explosion of communal violence			1
there have been sectarian shootings and assassinations of prominent local people outside their homes			2
residents say the government has begun deploying largely @entity77 militia in @entity79 neighborhoods such as @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 ¯ b and @entity84			0
though @entity5 is majority @entity79 , its leadership tends to belong to the @entity77 sect			1
@entity24 has long been a divided city , with @entity77 living in the south and a rapidly growing @entity79 population predominant in other neighborhoods			0
opposition activists claim that the regime is trying to incite sectarian strife in an effort to divide opponents and show what civil war in @entity5 might look like			1
residents of @entity24 who recently fled to neighboring @entity99 , and do n't want to be identified due to security concerns , say that sectarianism is neither endemic nor widespread , but admit that tensions between communities are increasing			0
they say that they want a united @entity5 but accuse the @entity42 regime of stoking sectarian flames			1
the unrest is not confined to @entity24			0
there are daily reports of protests , deaths and clampdowns by the security forces in the suburbs of @entity114 , in @entity115 to the south ( where the unrest began in march ) , and elsewhere			0
@entity49 defectors who have reached the relative safety of @entity99 speak of exhaustion after months on the streets , in some cases being ordered to fire on unarmed demonstrators			0
@entity0 spoke to one soldier in a hospital in northern @entity99			0
" too much killing , we were always in the streets , " he said			0
state media report ambushes of security personnel by armed gangs on a regular basis , though other accounts suggest these ambushes may often be clashes between defecting conscripts and elite units loyal to the regime			1
even so , the @entity142 ambassador to @entity5 , @entity143 , told @entity144 last month that the military was still " very powerful and very cohesive			1
" against this background of growing violence , the @entity5 economy is suffering -- its oil revenues declining just as government spending spirals			1
the government has announced spending will increase 60 % in 2012 -- much of it going for subsidies as it tries to tamp down the unrest			0
analysts say the state has little chance of improving tax revenues to cover this spending			0
international sanctions , including those against oil exports and @entity5 banks , are adding to the pain			1
last week , the @entity166 followed the @entity142 in freezing transactions with the @entity168 , which handles all letters of credit for the regime			2
the @entity5 economy is growing more and more isolated from international trade -- and sources of hard currency			1
last month , the @entity5 government banned a wide range of imports in an effort to save dwindling foreign exchange reserves , before the economy minister reversed the ban two weeks later " due to the legitimate demands of citizens , as it had more negative repercussions than anticipated			1
" many of those " legitimate demands " appear to have come from powerful business interests in @entity188 , @entity5 's second - largest city and its commercial hub			2
its @entity190 had roundly condemned the ban			0
just how much @entity188 means to the @entity42 government was illustrated wednesday , when a large pro-government rally there was broadcast on @entity5 tv			1
marchers carried the flags of @entity199 and @entity200 -- two countries that have resisted sanctions against @entity5			2
commentators say keeping @entity188 onside will be critical to the regime 's survival			2
if the city 's merchants and financiers -- the engine of @entity5 's beleaguered economy -- decide that the @entity42 regime is no longer viable , a key pillar of support will crumble			1
for much of the last seven months , opposition to the regime has been spontaneous and leaderless			2
now @entity42 's opponents seem to be more organized and are opening some important doors			1
the @entity219 , which was formed in @entity220 last month , comprises both representatives of local committees inside @entity5 and exiled personalities , and includes @entity225 and secular strands of opinion			2
earlier this week , @entity228 foreign minister @entity227 met with members of the @entity219 in @entity230 and advised them to work for peaceful change			0
but with every passing day , the prospect of peaceful change in @entity5 appears to diminish .			2

opposition to the @entity42 regime is becoming more organized and armed
violence is also taking on sectarian overtones
along with the increased violence , the @entity5 economy is *worsening*
