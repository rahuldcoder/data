for the first time ever , @entity0 unveiled two new iphones on tuesday , a traditional upgrade of its @entity5 as well as a simpler , cheaper version			1
@entity0 ceo @entity6 said the @entity7 and @entity8 are a reaction to a changing smartphone market			1
" business has become so large that this year we are going to replace the @entity5 and we 're going to replace it with not one , but two new designs , " @entity6 said			0
" this allows us to serve even more customers			0
" the @entity8 was the first phone demoed at tuesday 's event at @entity0 's @entity18 , @entity19 , headquarters			1
" it has an incredible all new design , one that 's more fun , more colorful than any @entity5 we 've made yet , " said @entity20 , @entity0 's senior vice president for marketing			1
in a video , @entity0 design guru @entity23 described the @entity8 as " beautifully , unapologetically plastic			1
" the phone will sell for as little as $ 99 , for a @entity27 version , and $ 199 for one with @entity28 of storage ( each with a two - year mobile contract )			0
in a departure , @entity0 will also be making its own cases for the @entity8 , selling them in a variety of colors for $ 29			1
then there 's the @entity7 , which is the more traditional update to the @entity5			2
" it is the gold standard in smartphones , " @entity20 said			0
the @entity7 features a handful of performance upgrades , including what @entity0 calls a dramatic increase in processing speed			1
it will have the first 64 - bit chip in a smartphone -- @entity0 's @entity48 -- which @entity20 said has tested at up to twice as fast as the @entity5 's processor			2
it also will have a new feature , a motion co-processor , that will let the phone be used as a fitness tracker along the lines of a @entity55			0
@entity20 said battery life will be " the same or better " than the @entity5 and its camera will have 15 % more active sensor space , improved white balance and auto - focus , and a new flash			0
also , its camera will , for the first time on @entity5 , allow video in slow motion			0
arguably the most dramatic new feature on the phone , though , is @entity68 , a fingerprint scanner for added security			0
users will be able to log into their phone via the home button and make purchases from @entity75 using their fingerprint as a password of sorts			0
the @entity7 will sell for $ 199 for a @entity27 version , $ 299 for a @entity28 model and $ 399 for the top - end @entity82 phone			1
pre-orders for the @entity8 starts on september 13			1
both versions are on sale starting september 20			1
@entity6 also announced the newest version of @entity0 's mobile operating system , @entity87 7 , will be released to the public on september 18			1
it will have over 200 new features , according to @entity0 , including the ability to switch voice - activated digital assistant @entity91 to a male voice			2
the @entity5 has remained the world 's top - selling smartphone , save for a few quarters when it was dethroned by phones in @entity99 's @entity98			0
but after making up nearly 24 % of all smartphones sold in late 2011 , @entity0 's device is now down to about 14 % , while @entity103 phones account for a whopping 79 %			1
with the @entity8 , @entity0 is clearly looking to emerging markets like @entity105 and @entity106 , where a less expensive phone would , presumably , sell well to a massive potential customer base			1
historically , rollouts of new @entity0 products have been near - mystical affairs for fans			2
but as the smartphone market has matured , some analysts say the real excitement may need to come from other products			0
" @entity0 needs a new ' hero product , ' but i do not think it necessarily has to be a phone , " @entity118 technology analyst @entity117 told @entity119			2
" with technology innovation slowing down , maybe they are better off turning @entity5 into a market - share grabber and showing innovation in another product			0
" a likely candidate could be the company 's anticipated " @entity128			0
" @entity0 is all but certain to join the emerging smartwatch market that @entity99 entered last week with its @entity132 device			2
also , @entity0 has also long been rumored to be working on a tv set .			0
