the @entity0 that 's now in shambles , its iconic red awning a nest of twisted metal , was once a favorite stop for residents here			1
the kids loved the slushies			1
the adults loved the doughnuts			1
and residents in the area say that before " the ruckus on @entity18 " -- in which looters and vandals parading as protesters mangled a primary corridor -- they could walk to @entity0 at any hour with nary a concern for their safety			1
it speaks to a city that enjoys the simpler things : a frozen custard at an old train depot , an afternoon casting reels in @entity28 , pork steak wednesdays at @entity31 's @entity30 or a night knocking back cold ones at the local brew house			1
the @entity35 that residents see on television , they do n't recognize that place			1
the tear gas canisters clanking through the streets , flash - bang grenades , military humvees and cops in riot gear facing off with angry protesters , many of them out - of - town rabble - rousers here to cause trouble -- yeah , this is n't @entity35 , they say			1
residents near the protest area have gotten the worst of it			1
their stores ' windows have been replaced with plywood , spray - painted with messages like , " thank you for your love and support			1
" protest blockades have trapped them in the neighborhoods at night , leaving them afraid to take walks or let their children play out of sight			2
for some , staying inside was no better , as the pungent tear gas used to choke and disperse troublemakers -- and incidentally , peaceful but precariously positioned protesters -- wafted down into their neighborhood			2
it seeped into their homes , stinging their eyes , skin and throat			2
they moved here because of the city 's solid schools , decent jobs , affordable housing and manageable crime rate			2
now , they 're choking in their living rooms			2
three weeks ago , before @entity93 was shot and killed by police officer @entity94 , @entity35 was an immensely different place , they said			1
seeing their city destroyed " the people are generally nice , humble			2
they just want to take care of the homes they have and keep it moving , " said @entity99 , a longtime black businessman in the area who opened his @entity102 on @entity18 the day before @entity93 was shot			2
opening a burger shop across from a @entity107 's on one of @entity35 's main drags may seem questionable , but like many people in the area , he said his fate is in someone else 's hands			1
" i have a good friend			2
i do n't worry about it , " said @entity99 , who has lived in @entity35 three years ; his mom has lived here for 20			1
in the nights after @entity93 's shooting -- when most businesses closed either intentionally or as a result of having their windows smashed and wares filched -- he stayed open until 10 or 11 p.m. , serving up his " garbage " burgers , complete with bacon and a fried egg , and @entity132 , a secret - recipe beverage resembling an @entity134 ( but do n't tell @entity99 that )			1
when tear gas canisters bounced into his parking lot , which he shares with a barbershop and beauty supply store , he opened his doors to protesters			2
inside the bare - bones eatery with its pithy signs -- " you say i dream too big , i say you think too small " -- refugees watched through hand - painted plate glass as the mayhem unfolded outside			2
@entity35 residents are n't used to being fearful			1
@entity150 statistics from 2012 show crime is a smidge higher than the national average , but it 's low for @entity155 , especially if you venture to the nearby suburbs of @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and the misleadingly named @entity160			2
in many parts of the city , blacks live next to whites , whites live next to blacks , and everyone seems to get along			2
at least they did before the town was overrun with strangers and it became unclear who was supporting @entity93 and who sought to stoke chaos			1
" from what i understand and know , @entity35 is a-ok , " said @entity99 , who lives in a diverse neighborhood down the street from his burger joint			1
a rift with police sure , there are exceptions : the nosy lady down the street always concerned with someone else 's business or the shopkeeper who seems to watch his black patrons too closely			2
and then there are the guys with badges			2
you 'll hear stories about them if you travel to some of the predominantly black neighborhoods : the nondescript block units of @entity197 or the oak - laden @entity198			2
and , of course , there 's the sprawling 400 - unit @entity203 development with its three - story , brick - and - siding dwellings recently refurbished with new wooden handrails and staircases			0
there , the police have a reputation for being tough , and while that 's good for keeping the drug dealers and gangbangers who plague @entity155 off @entity35 's streets , many innocent black teens and young men are swept up in the effort to keep @entity35 safe , residents said			1
older african - americans seem less affected , but they have stories about nephews , sons or family friends being roughed up or dressed down in this city of 21,000			0
@entity225 , a nurse who lives a few blocks from the cross-and - candle memorial that marks the spot where @entity93 took his last step , said she has never had issues with police , but she noted that she 's a 41 - year - old woman			0
as youngsters , their elementary school closed because of the protests , rambled through her front yard and played basketball on a miniature hoop , she explained how her sons -- ages 17 , 19 and 21 -- have different experiences			1
they and other young black men have been stopped for reasons as spurious as looking suspicious , she said			0
" how does a person look suspicious ? what do you have to be wearing to look suspicious ? " she asked before mimicking an offending police officer , " ' where you going ? what you doing ? how you doing it ? ' it 's none of your business			0
" outside his bustling barbershop on a muggy @entity258 afternoon , @entity253 , his ears tucked under a spiffy @entity256 snapback , recalled how one of his sons , an a student , was arrested with several other kids in the parking lot of an auto parts store			0
they 'd met there because it was a central location to rendezvous before a game of basketball			0
when @entity253 picked his son up , police told him he had n't been charged , just taken away by police , said @entity253 , adding that he 's been pulled over for @entity273 , or " driving while black , " a common complaint in @entity35			1
at a protest in a parking lot across from the police station , @entity278 , 22 , a @entity35 resident of eight years , relayed a similar story : a @entity35 officer once pulled him over and said he was looking for a suspect with dreadlocks			1
" and i got a box cut , " he said , pointing to his dyed - blond ' do			0
it 's not just blacks complaining			0
@entity286 , 31 , a military brat who moved to @entity35 in 1994 , recalled being smacked in the head by a @entity35 cop after an argument over a noise complaint			1
" they 've always been a * * holes , " he said			0
" they all got a power trip problem , a lot of them			0
" it 's this kind of police behavior that creates rifts in the community , said @entity253 , a 33 - year - old father of four			0
" you 're supposed to be happy when you see police			0
but no , not really , " he said			0
many changing faces @entity35 used to be a hiccup of a town hosting a train depot between @entity155 and @entity311			1
it popped up in 1894 on a few deeded acres			0
in its first census , it boasted 1,000 residents			0
a century will bring change to any city , but the times have frequently altered the face of @entity35			1
it has been a commuter stop , a bedroom community for the automotive and airline industries and now , with 40 % of its population younger than 25 , a hub for students			0
another change ? twenty - five years ago , one in four residents was black			0
today , the number is two of three			0
yet despite that shift , two things have remained static : @entity35 's police force and the @entity336 are overwhelmingly white			1
the old depot is now an eatery and museum , next to a train trellis that sports banners promoting church fish fries and the local farmers market , one of the state 's most popular			0
on saturdays , about 50 volunteers set up tents and tables , as area residents arrive to buy plump tomatoes and sweet corn from growers such as @entity353 down the street			0
also nearby is @entity356 's handsomely appointed real estate office with fiber art from local artists adorning the walls			0
located between a bike shop and wine bar on a 10 - block stretch of downtown known as @entity365 , the area features concert series , festivals and @entity368			0
@entity370 you 'll find dozens of " century homes , " architecturally distinct @entity373 , @entity374 and @entity375 structures with sweeping roofs , gables and expansive porches			0
residents mail - ordered them from @entity381 and @entity382 during the early 1900s " this is the kind of stuff that makes the community really strong			0
it makes it attractive , " @entity356 said			0
but be clear : while this part of @entity35 has a diverse mix of residents traversing its streets , its historic buildings and well - kept landscaping are a contrast from the strip malls and $ 500 - a - month apartments along @entity18			1
aside from broken windows at a liquor store and brake shop and a few other acts of vandalism , this side of town has remained relatively unscathed during the protests , perhaps because of the downtown police station			1
or maybe because it 's a mile from where @entity93 lost his life			0
whatever the reason , the residents along @entity18 yearn for a return to the normalcy that is still day - to - day life on the other side of town			1
thursday 's and friday 's protests were some of the most peaceful yet			1
some black residents , though , are skeptical it can stay that way , especially if @entity94 is n't indicted			0
" if this police officer do n't get no kind of charge , " said the nurse , @entity425 , shaking her head at the potentiality , " they think it 's chaos now ? "			0

@entity35 yearns for more " normal " days
shooting and protests have changed the town
resident : " from what i understand , @entity35 is a-ok "
