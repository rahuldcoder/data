-- wildlife researchers in @entity2 have photographed one of the world 's most reclusive primates for the first time			1
sightings of the @entity9 slender loris -- a small nocturnal primate with extremely thin arms and legs and huge round eyes -- are so rare that the creature has only been seen four times since 1937			1
conservationists feared the species had become extinct during a 63 - year gap between sightings from 1939 to 2002			1
populations of all types of slender loris , which are native to the rainforests of @entity2 and southern @entity24 , have been in decline in recent years because of destruction of their forest habitat by logging , agriculture and development			1
that prompted an 18 - month study of the creatures led by researchers working for the @entity35 's edge project -- a conservation initiative dedicated to raising awareness about the plight of animals on the brink of extinction			0
researchers from the @entity43 and the @entity44 also took part			0
research leader @entity46 said more than 1,000 nocturnal studies in 120 different forest areas had been conducted as part of the study			0
" this discovery is a great reward for the ongoing field research we undertake across much of south - western @entity2 , " @entity46 said			2
@entity35 conservation biologist dr. @entity55 said the study was the first close examination of a @entity9 slender loris ever conducted			1
the pictures show a 20 - centimeter long male adult sitting on a forest branch forest			0
conservationists have discovered it appears to have shorter and sturdier limbs than other loris ; a possible adaptation for the cooler , high - altitude montane -- or cloud -- forest in which it lives			2
that could mean the @entity9 slender loris is a distinct species in its own right , said @entity46			1
results of the study are published in the latest edition of the journal @entity79			0
" we are thrilled to have captured the first ever photographs and prove its continued existence -- especially after its 65 year disappearing act , " said @entity55			0
" the discovery improves our knowledge of this species , but we need to focus our efforts on the conservation and restoration of the remaining montane forest where this species still exists			0
currently this accounts for less than one percent of the land area of @entity2			2

@entity9 slender loris only seen four times since 1937
conservationists have photographed *endangered* primate for the first time
@entity104 is native to @entity2 but *threatened* by *deforestation*
researchers believe @entity9 slender loris could be a distinct species
