years before @entity1 sold @entity1 ad space on her forehead for $ 10,000 , and long before an image of the @entity6 was toasted into the buttery crust of a grilled cheese sandwich and hocked for $ 28,000 , there was a little family in a little town in @entity11 that imprinted their names onto the awkward pages of @entity16 infamy with another strange sale			1
just about everyone in my hometown of @entity23 knew @entity24 had grown up there , but i would guess there were n't too many who could point out which house had been hers			2
that is , until we bought it and put it on national tv			1
it all started when i returned home from college after my freshman year to find my newfound freedom again weighed down by daily parental oversight			0
it was that awkward juncture between childhood and adulthood , and one muttered phrase to my dad -- " did you know @entity24 's house is for sale ? you should buy it and put it on @entity16 " -- sent us down a path that would become the story of something much bigger than us , even bigger than one of the world 's most famous celebrities			1
my older brother @entity60 almost never tells the story			0
it was my dad 's money of course , but in his mid- 20s , @entity60 became the face of it all because my dad does n't love attention and youth sells			0
he and my father have decidedly different takes on the whole ordeal			0
my brother says he 's embarrassed at the outcome and disappointed that in some circles he may always be known for this one stupid thing			0
my dad chalks it up to a " great learning experience and a lot of fun			0
" it was a 30 - day auction that just happened to bookend one of the biggest events in @entity83 history			1
at the time , @entity16 was a relatively new phenomenon , and celebrity worship was at an all - time high			1
when you watch this video , you may judge us harshly , but i want to share this story because i believe it says a striking amount about one of the starkest cultural shifts our country has ever experienced			2
it 's perhaps the least important story you 'll ever see on the subject , but i hope you 'll find it interesting , because i had to beg to get my family to tell it again			2
@entity24 's 2012 world tour opens may 31 in @entity103			1
