-- @entity2 tabloids have led a feeding frenzy of international media coverage that started weeks ahead of prince @entity5 and @entity6 , duchess of @entity10 's @entity9 visit , but the @entity12 media have been slower to smell the blood			1
local coverage of the celebrity couple 's 10 - day visit that starts april 7 has been respectful but largely reactive in its attempts to inspire the same degree of public adulation for @entity2 royalty last seen here 31 years ago			1
that was in 1983 , when 10 - month - old prince @entity5 visited @entity12 for the first time with his parents @entity23 and princess @entity25			1
the young prince was just a few weeks older then than his son @entity27 will be on this visit			1
the lacklustre coverage is understandable given the absence of any real angles until the @entity12 leg of the @entity9 tour actually begins and the international media scrum starts seriously jostling for saleable scoops			2
other factors include the shrinking sizes of newsrooms and the fact that many of the royal stories run have been " handed to the media on an official plate , " as one senior editor put it			0
and , regardless of whether @entity12 these days are royalists or republicans , they also have a strong distaste for the sensationalist diet of royal reporting the @entity2 are so used to being fed. until this weekend , the biggest royal media story has been the furore following a former @entity2 protection officer 's comments that the release of maps of public viewing points for the royal tour was effectively " a manual for terrorists			1
" newspapers , television and radio have otherwise been rolling out a steady stream of " easy click " soft stories and pretty photos , as much to score rating points as to genuinely slake the perceived thirst here for information about the " it - couple " whose international popularity is at an all - time high			2
some editors quietly bemoan the fact that the " easy words and easy pictures " royal coverage is out of proportion to public interest which would be better served with more coverage of the upcoming budget , national elections and recently plummeting prices for the some of the country 's main dairy export products			0
how much @entity12 are really hankering to see the @entity89 and @entity90 and their much adored eight - month - old @entity27 ca n't be accurately gauged until the crowds do , or do n't , choke the streets			1
either way , the media is prepared , on paper at least , for the trio who , royal roots aside , have attained pop star status , in particular in the @entity99			0
official media briefings around the country have been full , and of the 450 media accredited to cover the tour , nearly three quarters are local			0
editors planning nationwide radio , television and newspaper coverage as well as around - the - clock online and social media content are all throwing maximum resources at the tour			2
the commitment is , of course , as much about beaming stories and photos of the royals to the rest of the world as it is to satisfying @entity12 audiences			2
it is also a priceless opportunity to promote tourism by showcasing images of @entity12 's natural beauty along with those of the beautiful couple and the loveable third - in - line to the @entity2 throne			1
@entity129 , one of the country 's two biggest media chains , will have staff at every royal event			0
" that 's not necessarily because its news			0
but if something went wrong , you have to be there , " said @entity129 's national content editor , @entity137			0
sources close to officials managing the royal visit say they are optimistically expecting " a bit of hysteria			0
" during prince @entity5 's first @entity12 visit , the sight of him being set loose to crawl on the lawns of @entity150 in @entity151 with an iconic @entity153 toy touched people 's hearts			1
when i covered that visit , there was still a collective sense of pride among most @entity12 at welcoming members of " our royal family " whose mother and grandmother was " our @entity166			1
" when @entity5 , @entity90 and @entity27 visit this week , @entity12 who choose to connect with them will do so on various levels , many of them with little regard for any loyalty to royalty			1
there is no doubt that an empathetic @entity5 endeared himself again to @entity12 when he made a special trip here in 2011 to meet families of the victims of that year 's devastating @entity178 earthquake and of the 2010 @entity179			0
public interest will be high in @entity90 who is visiting @entity12 for the first time on the couple 's first official overseas visit with @entity27			1
what could be more feel - good than a pretty , well - dressed " princess " toting her beautiful baby ? a referendum within the next three years will decide whether @entity12 will change their national flag , which has included @entity2 's @entity191 for more than 100 years			1
public opposition to changing the flag has grown over the past few years to just over 50 % of people polled , with half of those who were polled between the ages of 18 to 39 being opponents			0
@entity12 's indigenous people , the @entity199 , have always had a close connection with the @entity201 , partly because of a historic and often abrogated treaty signed by @entity199 in the 19th century with representatives of @entity166 @entity204			0
this year , however , the @entity205 has declined to see the @entity89 and @entity90 because he believed their diary allowed too little time for traditional ritual			2
the crowds that turn out to catch a glimpse of the royals are likely to include a higher proportion of rubber - neckers , anti-royalists and people who just go ga - ga over good - looking , blue - blooded babies than of true - blue royalists			0

the @entity89 and @entity90 and @entity27 arrive in @entity12 april 7
it will be the first visit @entity227 for the 8 - month - old prince and his mother
@entity231 says @entity12 media has not embraced the feeding frenzy of @entity2 tabloids
she says while interest may be high it does n't necessarily mean the population is royalist
