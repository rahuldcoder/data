@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has spent a lifetime exploring @entity1 's @entity5 searching for the origins of man			1
each layer of sediment , says the paleoanthropologist and founder of the @entity12 , helps to tell the narrative of human evolution			0
" you get the whole story of life represented going back from the present right back to the beginnings of an ape that has two legs as opposed to four , " @entity3 said			1
" so the whole story of humanity you can actually trace to the @entity5			1
" but @entity3 says these ancient hills tell another story , a history of climactic changes that gave rise to some species and led to the extinction of others			1
with climate change , he says , this history could be repeated			1
" the future of humanity is not going to be in the sediments , it is going to be in our minds and our thinking and unfortunately what we find here is that evidence , " @entity3 said			1
" what we find here that is scientifically provable , immutable facts does n't necessarily get absorbed for the moment by the political class who simply do n't want to know the ugly truth that the world is a mess			0
" on the shores of @entity0 -- the largest desert lake in the world -- they do n't need to know the science of climate change			1
for more than 1,000 years , fishermen have been bringing in their catch , but , in less than a generation , they have witnessed disturbing changes			1
" when i was young this lake was full , says @entity65 , a local fisherman			2
" the water just keeps going down			2
we used to get big fish every day , now they are tiny			0
" @entity65 has reason to worry			0
sometimes it is hard to see the effects of climate change , but not at @entity0			1
global human impact on @entity75 thirty years ago the area was covered with water			2
now , it is just sand and gravel			0
and scientists believe that in just a few decades it will be reduced to a couple of puddles			0
@entity86 dam projects could further hasten the retreat , a potential catastrophe for the entire region that depends on the lake for food and economic survival			1
" i think the prospect of many of these half million people living around the lake today of having to relocate to cities and to slums and to abandon their culture , abandon their ancestral land , become paupers in their own land , i think it is very real , " @entity3 says			1
" i think the way of life is gone ... i have no doubt about that at all			0
i think if you came back here or my grandchildren came back in 50 years we would n't recognize what we are talking about today			2
" @entity3 's @entity12 is trying to understand how climate change is affecting the @entity0			1
more : could big cities lead fight against climate change ? sometimes the best thing to do is listen			1
the @entity0 say the rains are less frequent and the droughts come more often			0
the unpredictable weather and vanishing pasture has decimated their herds			0
climate change does affect the @entity0 people , says @entity125 from the @entity12			1
" with the increase of drought it has made the communities unable to adapt to the changes , because it happens so often , " @entity125 said			0
@entity3 says that anyone skeptical about climate change should visit the @entity5			1
" coming to a place like this , i think you actually show people what happens			0
these are real issues that you can see and feel and almost touch that may make people understand that we are on the edge of a precipice and we are going over , " he said			0
" we have accelerated a process and it is based on the belief that somehow we can maintain control			0
i think our carbon dioxide emissions are out of control			0
" even with the changes around @entity0 , fishermen like @entity151 still try to eke out a living the only way they know how			2
he worries what will be left for his son @entity156 if the lake continues to recede			2
" if there is no lake or no fish , then the people will not survive around this lake			2
this lake is the @entity165 's life , " @entity65 says			2
this place has helped unlock humanity 's past			0
today , it could also be providing a window on its future .			0

*conservationist* @entity3 has been working in @entity1 's @entity5 for years
@entity3 says fishermen have seen evidence of climate change in the water as levels recede
potentially catastrophic as entire region is dependent on the lake for food and economic survival
