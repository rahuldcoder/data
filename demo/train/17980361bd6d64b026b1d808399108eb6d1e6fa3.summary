@entity0 -- for the past 30 years , @entity2 has attended the @entity3 -- a house of worship that held a fish fry this month for the congregation 's widows and widowers and where kids attend vacation bible school in the summers			1
such things are important to folks in @entity2 's hometown of @entity15 , @entity16 , population : 4,448			1
it is a town named for a @entity16 senator , @entity19 -- a relative of @entity20 , but which proudly goes by the nickname " the free state of jones " thanks to @entity26 's role in opposing the @entity27 during the @entity28			2
raised in an environment where both conservative christian values and an independent streak run deep , it is perhaps little wonder that one of the city 's native sons would challenge long - serving sen. @entity37 for office			1
and , if the money pouring into @entity2 's campaign coffers from conservative groups is any indication , hopes are high among such organizations that @entity2 just might pull off a rebellion of his own in tuesday 's runoff			1
" it 's all in @entity50 's hands , " @entity2 told @entity1			1
" ... @entity50 has a plan			0
we pray to find his will , and his will will be done			0
we 're going to fight , every day he gives us , and we believe we 're going to be victorious , pursuant to his will			0
" @entity2 , a conservative who has the grassroots support of the tea party , the @entity60 and @entity61 among others , is challenging @entity37 , a septuagenarian , who has the backing of such groups as the @entity66 @entity65 and @entity16 conservatives , a super pac headed by the nephew of former @entity16 gov. @entity70			1
' the indifference that comes from a long - term incumbent ' @entity2 has " been able to capitalize on the indifference that comes from a long - term incumbent , " said @entity73 , chairman of the @entity75 's political science department			1
" he 's also been able to capture some of the more national anti-establishment @entity79 movement			0
" tea party conservatives -- who were dealt setbacks in @entity79 primaries in @entity84 and other states in the spring -- are banking on @entity16 as the best chance to eject another " establishment " @entity79			0
the group 's organizers are galvanized by a surprise upset in the @entity92 primary when @entity94 majority leader @entity93 lost to tea party - backed political newcomer @entity95			0
" @entity2 reflects that change momentum we 're seeing all over the country , " @entity97 , co-founder and a chief strategist for the @entity97 told @entity1			1
@entity37 's " been a distinguished senator over the years but he 's lost track with where the people of @entity16 are			1
" if @entity2 and @entity37 's inability to net 50 % of the vote in the june 3 @entity79 primary is any indication , then the people of @entity16 are split			1
@entity111 's arrest shakes up @entity16 @entity79 primary it 's also a race that , at times , waded into the @entity16 mud			0
last month , political blogger @entity116 was arrested after authorities charged him with breaking into a nursing home where @entity37 's wife , @entity119 , has lived for roughly 14 years			1
photos of the elderly woman ended up in a political attack ad on @entity123 , according to the @entity124			0
both @entity37 and @entity2 denounced the act , but the fallout prompted both campaigns to accuse the other of playing dirty politics			1
but in @entity26 at least , where @entity15 is located , the odds are in the hometown boy 's favor			0
@entity133 handily won his home county in the june 3 primary with 11,519 votes to @entity37 's 1,941 , according to the @entity16 secretary of state 's office			1
native son @entity2 is the grandson of country music star @entity139 , who went by the stage name " @entity141			1
" he grew up as an only child whose parents worked at @entity26 @entity144			0
his was a religious upbringing and , according to his campaign 's @entity150 page , he " committed his life to @entity146 at the age of 13			0
" he was also an athlete who excelled in basketball and won a scholarship to attend the @entity75			0
he eventually earned a law degree from @entity75 and married @entity157 , an educator and former beauty pageant queen who was once " @entity16			0
" the couple are raising their children @entity161 and @entity164 back in @entity26			0
in addition to practicing as an attorney , @entity2 was also a syndicated conservative radio host of " @entity167 , " which says it offers " today 's news commentary from the @entity171 side of @entity173 conservative politics			1
" back then , his knack for hammering liberal policies caught the attention of local conservatives			0
" i 'd hear him on the radio , and i 'd think ' that guy 's a true conservative , ' " said @entity178 , a longtime associate and chairman of the @entity180			2
complete coverage : 2014 midterm elections @entity2 's on - air comments would later come back to haunt him			2
earlier this year , a radio clip surfaced of @entity2 vowing " i ai n't paying taxes , " if his taxes increased because reparations were paid to the descendants of @entity194 who were enslaved			1
he also made fun of @entity196 and said " a dollar bill can buy a mansion in @entity199			0
" in the spotlight @entity2 was thrust into the national media spotlight			2
campaign spokesman @entity202 blew off the blowback			0
" the liberal press clearly loves to attack conservatives of all types , " @entity202 told the @entity204			0
" when @entity2 got into this race he knew they would throw mud , so it 's no surprise they 'd dredge up decade - old comments made on conservative talk radio			1
@entity2 burst onto the @entity16 political scene in 2010 as a freshman state senator when he challenged gov. @entity70 's veto of a measure that would block the state from using eminent domain to take land to be used by private companies			2
that effort failed but inspired a grassroots - backed initiative which was ultimately successful			0
that same year , he led the legal effort in his state to have the courts declare @entity230 's insurance mandate unconstitutional			0
he has vowed to work to appeal @entity230 if he is elected to the @entity231			0
much like the senator he is challenging , @entity2 sat on his state legislature 's @entity231 appropriation committee			1
like @entity37 , he 's also pulling in star power to help out in the final campaign push			1
@entity237 -- who hosted " @entity238 , " " @entity239 " and " @entity240 " -- campaigned for @entity2 this weekend			2
key races to watch in 2014 the @entity2 campaign did not respond to @entity1 's questions about his tenure in state office or his plans should he be elected to the @entity231			2
still , supporters such as @entity178 hope that voters will recognize what he sees as @entity2 's " authentic conservative voice			2
" and , as for those who question what @entity2 as a congressional neophyte who eschews pork barrel spending will be able to accomplish for @entity16 , @entity178 said @entity2 would serve the state 's interests well while steering clear of government waste			2
" @entity37 did not hang the moon , " @entity178 said			2
" and @entity2 can not take it down			2
" sen. @entity37 , a quiet pragmatist facing re-election challenge @entity1 chief congressional correspondent @entity262 contributed to this report .			1
