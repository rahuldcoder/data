@entity3 contractor @entity1 , held by the @entity5 government since 2009 , was freed wednesday as part of a landmark deal with @entity5 that paves the way for a major overhaul in @entity3 policy toward the island , senior administration officials tell @entity12			1
president @entity13 spoke with @entity5 president @entity14 tuesday in a phone call that lasted about an hour and reflected the first communication at the presidential level with @entity5 since the @entity5 revolution , according to @entity20 officials			1
@entity13 announced @entity1 ' release and the new diplomatic stance at noon in @entity23			1
at around the same time , @entity5 president @entity14 was set to speak in @entity24			2
president @entity13 announced a major loosening of travel and economic restrictions on the country			1
and the two nations are set to re-open embassies , with preliminary discussions on that next step in normalizing diplomatic relations beginning in the coming weeks , a senior administration official tells @entity12			2
talks between the @entity3 and @entity5 have been ongoing since june of 2013 and were facilitated by the @entity37 and the @entity38 in brokering the deal			1
@entity40 -- the first pope from @entity41 -- encouraged @entity13 in a letter and in their meeting this year to renew talks with @entity5 on pursuing a closer relationship			1
@entity1 ' " humanitarian " release by @entity5 was accompanied by a separate spy swap , the officials said			1
@entity5 also freed a @entity3 intelligence source who has been jailed in @entity5 for more than 20 years , although authorities did not identify that person for security reasons			1
the @entity3 released three @entity5 intelligence agents convicted of espionage in 2001			1
the developments constitute what officials called the most sweeping change in @entity3 policy toward @entity5 since 1961 , when the embassy closed and the embargo was imposed			1
officials described the planned actions as the most forceful changes the president could make without legislation passing through @entity68			0
for a president who took office promising to engage @entity5 , the move could help shape @entity13 's foreign policy legacy			1
" we are charting a new course toward @entity5 , " a senior administration official said			2
" the president understood the time was right to attempt a new approach , both because of the beginnings of changes in @entity5 and because of the impediment this was causing for our regional policy			0
" @entity1 was arrested after traveling under a program under the @entity86 to deliver satellite phones and other communications equipment to the island 's small @entity90 population			2
@entity5 officials charged he was trying to foment a " @entity93			0
" in 2011 , he was convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison for attempting to set up an internet network for @entity5 dissidents " to promote destabilizing activities and subvert constitutional order			0
" after losing hope and health in @entity5 , @entity1 finally released senior administration officials and @entity5 observers have said recent reforms on the island and changing attitudes in the @entity3 have created an opening for improved relations			1
@entity3 and @entity5 officials say @entity23 and @entity24 in recent months have increased official technical - level contacts on a variety of issues			1
@entity13 publicly acknowledged for the first time last week that @entity23 was negotiating with @entity24 for @entity1 ' release through a " variety of channels			1
" " we 've been in conversations about how we can get @entity1 home for quite some time , " @entity13 said in an interview with @entity118 television network			1
" we continue to be concerned about him			0
" sen. @entity123 , @entity124 , and rep. @entity125 , @entity1 ' @entity126 congressman , are on the plane with @entity1 and his wife , @entity128 , according to government officials			0
the group of members left at 4 a.m. et wednesday from @entity23 for @entity5			2
more on detained @entity3 @entity1 ' lawyer , @entity132 , told @entity12 last month the years of confinement have taken their toll on his client			1
@entity1 has lost more than 100 pounds and is losing his teeth			0
his hips are so weak that he can barely walk and he has lost vision in one eye			0
he has also undertaken hunger strikes and threatened to take his own life			0
with @entity1 ' health in decline , a bipartisan group of 66 senators wrote @entity13 a letter in november 2013 urging him to " act expeditiously to take whatever steps are in the national interest to obtain [ @entity1 's ] release			1
" the three @entity5 released as a part of the deal belonged the so - called @entity152 , a quintet of @entity5 intelligence officers convicted in 2001 for espionage			2
they were part of what was called the @entity152 , which collected intelligence on prominent @entity5 - @entity3 exile leaders and @entity3 military bases			1
the leader of the five , @entity152 , was linked to the february 1996 downing of the two civilian planes operated by the @entity3 - based dissident group @entity162 , in which four men died			0
he is serving a two life sentences			0
@entity165 , also known as @entity152 ; and @entity152 have just a few years left on their sentences			0
the remaining two -- @entity168 and @entity169 -- were released after serving most of their 15 - year sentences and have already returned to @entity5 , where they were hailed as heroes			0
wednesday 's announcement that the @entity3 will move toward restoring diplomatic ties with @entity5 will also make it easier for @entity3 to travel to @entity5 and do business with the @entity5 people by extending general licenses , officials said			1
while the more liberal travel restrictions wo n't allow for tourism , they will permit greater @entity3 travel to the island			1
secretary of state @entity185 has also been instructed to review @entity5 's place on the @entity189 list , potentially paving the the way a lift on certain economic and political sanctions			0
the revised relationship between the @entity3 and @entity5 comes ahead of the march 2015 @entity194 , where the island country is set to participate for the first time			1
in the past , @entity23 has vetoed @entity24 's participation on the grounds it is not a democracy			0
this year , several countries have said they would not participate if @entity5 was once again barred			2
while only @entity68 can formally overturn the five decades - long embargo , the @entity20 has some authorities to liberalize trade and travel to the island			0
the 1996 @entity208 , which enshrined the embargo into legislation , allows for the president to extend general or specific licenses through a presidential determination , which could be justified as providing support for the @entity5 people or democratic change in @entity5			0
both presidents @entity216 and @entity13 exercised such authority to ease certain provisions of the regulations implementing the @entity5 sanctions program			1
in an effort to boost the nascent @entity5 private sector , the president will also allow expanded commercial sales and exports of goods and services to @entity5 , particularly building materials for entrepreneurs and private residences , and allow greater business training , as well as permit greater communications hardware and services to go to the island			0
other announced changes permit @entity3 and @entity5 banks to build relationships and travelers to use credit and debit cards			1
@entity3 travelers will be allowed to import up to $ 400 worth of goods from @entity5 , including $ 100 in alcohol and tobacco -- even @entity5 cigars			1
remittances by @entity3 to their families back in @entity5 will also be increased to approximately $ 2,000 per quarter			1
officials stressed the moves were not being undertaken to prop up the @entity14 regime , but rather to encourage further reforms on the island			0
" none of this is seen as a reward			0
all of this is seen as a way of promoting change in @entity5 because everything we have done in the past has demonstrably failed , " another senior administration official said			2
" this is not the @entity3 government saying @entity5 has gotten so much better			2
it is still an authoritarian state and we still have profound differences with this government			0
" " but if we hope for change with @entity5 , we must try for a different approach			0
and we believe that considerably more engagement with the @entity5 people and the @entity5 government is the way to do that , " the official said , adding that the @entity3 " will not for a moment lessen our support for improvement in human rights			2
" to that end , @entity5 has agreed to release 53 political prisoners from a list of names provided by the @entity3			2
at least one of the prisoners has already been released			0
@entity24 has also agreed to permit significant access by its citizens to the @entity288 and allow the @entity290 and @entity291 human rights officials back on the island for the first time in years			0
talks on a deal began between senior @entity20 and @entity5 officials last year and happened in fits and starts , officials said			2
the officials praised the role the @entity38 played as guarantor of the process			0
officials would not reveal the name of the @entity3 intelligence source , but officials said he was the individual who revealed to the @entity3 the @entity152 , which included the @entity152			0
" he was a very important hero , " the @entity3 official said			0
the moves are far more sweeping than the last action @entity13 took toward @entity5 in january 2011 , when he eased restrictions on travel to and from the island			1
relations have been largely frozen since @entity1 ' conviction and the @entity20 has made his release a condition of improved ties			2
in 2013 , @entity13 drew praise from advocates of changing @entity3 policy toward @entity5 when he said the @entity3 had to be " creative " and " thoughtful " about fostering change on the island			1
" the notion that the same policies that we put in place in 1961 would somehow still be as effective as they are today , in the age of the @entity288 and @entity333 and world travel , does n't make sense , " @entity13 said at a november 2013 fundraiser in @entity326			2
" we have to continue to update our policies			0
