-- we learned a few things on monday night , those of us watching @entity3 on " @entity4 , " about @entity5 , one of the people who died in the gunfire at theater 9 in the @entity10 multiplex in @entity11 , @entity12			1
we learned that in high school , " for no reason whatever , " as his father put it , @entity5 always wore white t - shirts and blue jeans , and that one day some 400 to 500 kids from the school wore the same outfit , declaring an unofficial " @entity21			2
" we got to meet @entity5 's best friend , @entity23 , who spoke about how people were " drawn to him			2
" and his girlfriend , @entity26 , who told us , among other things , about the last act of @entity5 's life , which in some ways is all you need to know : he dove across her body to protect her from the bullets			2
opinion : three @entity11 heroes gave their lives perhaps most painfully , we met @entity37 , the father of @entity5 , a likeable , visibly hurt man			1
he said , when @entity3 asked how he was holding up : " it 's the worst day of my life every day			1
@entity5 was my firstborn son			0
i love him with all my heart			0
" @entity5 had something to say to the news media , too , something impossible to ignore : " and if we do n't stop talking about the gunman -- so somebody took a gun and went in and shot a 6 - year - old girl ? why are we talking about that person ? " he went on : " i would like to see @entity0 come out with a policy that said , ' moving forward , we 're not going to talk about the gunman			1
what we 're going to say is : a coward walked into a movie theater and started shooting people			2
the coward 's in jail			2
he will never see the light of day again			0
let 's move on ' ... @entity0 , @entity58 , the major networks			2
why do n't you guys all come out with a policy that says , we 're not going to show this [ killer ] again ? that would be my -- that would be my challenge to you and to every network			1
" as compelling and tempting as his plea is , i would argue that @entity5 is only half right			0
the mass killings certainly dominated the news , quickly becoming one of the biggest stories of 2012			1
nearly three quarters of the nation has been following it " very " or " fairly " closely , according to @entity80			0
still , if mass shootings were n't big news , you would worry			1
@entity85 ' face , meanwhile , made it to a number of front pages in the wake of the massacre , as shown in @entity93 's @entity92 feature , but not as often or as large as you might think			2
and you did want to know what he looked like , did n't you ? even @entity37 went to court to see his face			1
looking into the minds of killers like @entity5 , many people suspect that some sort of media glory is part of the payoff for these mass killers			1
but the truth of the matter is we do n't have a clue			0
nor do we have an idea if some sort of media blackout about them would have any effect in preventing this type of incident from occurring again			1
court appearance fuels theories about @entity12 shooting suspect as an analogy , one he freely admitted is on a wholly different level , @entity5 used the example of people running on fields during professional ball games			0
the media stopped showing such incidents , he pointed out , and now that the tv cameras no longer show these runners , he asked , " when was the last time you saw somebody jump on the field ? " the problem , unfortunately , is that people still jump on ball fields			1
i just search for " people running on baseball fields " on @entity141 and up popped recent incidents in 10 cities , all recorded on cell phones , as well as two websites that collects such videos			0
stories of survival amidst the shooting what really causes mass murderers to commit their crimes ? mental illness ? environmental factors ? something worse ? news media speculation about the motive is n't helpful to anyone			1
yet people around the country are concerned ; some are even traumatized by this event			0
it is natural to wonder why and how the horrific shooting happened			1
and to the extent that it can address such big questions , news organizations should make the necessary inquiries -- dig into the suspect 's past , find indicators of questionable behavior , look for signs of terrifying intent			1
this is the media 's responsibility			1
warning signs of violence : what to do news outlets should never glorify killers in any way			1
in the chance that being on television and across the front pages could be a draw to killers , the news media must err on the side of caution in its coverage			1
the prime focus should be properly on the victims			0
and , i would add , on the victims ' friends and families , who tell us so movingly that they will remember			0
as @entity5 said , " you know , @entity5 would have expected us to live			0
we 're going to live			0
" to report that kind of love and guts is essential			0
still , when something like this happens , we are , as a society , like a tribe discussing the events around the campfire			0
reporters are something like the tribal scouts			0
there are wolves , and we have questions : how many wolves ? how do they act ? which way should we go ? how to help the victims here , too , we have questions : who is this killer ? what concrete facts give clues to how he got that way ? is there any law or cultural change that might deter the next one ? were signals missed ? all of this matters			0
tell us about the wolves			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity235 .			2

on @entity3 's show , a father of a victim of the @entity11 shooting asks about media 's role
@entity235 : is @entity37 right to say news organizations should ignore the mass killers
he says it 's natural to ask why the horrific incident happened and what motivated the gunman
@entity235 : media should make the necessary inquiries but never glorify the killer
