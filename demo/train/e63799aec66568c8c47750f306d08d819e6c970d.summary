-- @entity1 is hoping to give its get - out - the - vote campaign a viral boost with an online game , inspired by fantasy sports , that rewards players for participating in the 2012 elections			1
gamers will rack up points in " @entity11 " for registering to vote , watching debates and publicly supporting candidates with transparent fundraising records and who refrain from political mudslinging			1
" this can be can be a crash course in what people should demand from those pursuing the privilege of elected office , " said @entity17 , @entity1 's vice president of public affairs , who revealed details about the game to in advance of its tuesday launch			1
as in fantasy football or baseball , " @entity11 " is an online social game in which participants strategically build virtual teams of candidates and compete against other players from around the country for glory and prizes			1
players can " draft " any candidate running for the @entity47 presidency , the @entity41 and the @entity42			2
to encourage players to select honest , inspiring politicians , the most valuable candidates will have measurable integrity as well as strong poll numbers			2
each candidate 's " value " will be an aggregation of several key data points from specific partners : polling data from poll aggregator , @entity60			1
the longer a candidate is winning his or her race , the more points they 'll earn			2
a transparency fundraising score from the @entity67 , which publicizes campaign contribution and spending data			0
for instance , @entity70 would score well in this category , given that he famously tried to disclose every single campaign expenditure -- even a 22 - cent purchase at @entity75			0
frequency of social media engagement on @entity78 and @entity79			0
declaring their stances on @entity83 's " @entity82 , " which " measures each candidate 's willingness to provide citizens with their positions on key issues			1
" discussing substantive issues rather than airing " uncivil , personal ads " , as ranked by the @entity92 , which houses a public database of information on the " content and targeting " of broadcast television advertisements from around the country			0
" there 's a lot of young people who are at the beginning of their civic career , " says @entity17			2
" when you 're 18 and you 're voting for the first time , you do n't necessarily know what you deserve from a politician			0
" he says he hopes the game will instill the habits of good citizenship among young voters			1
additionally , @entity1 hopes that highlighting the most virtuous political candidates will re-energize young citizens , many of whom are disheartened by the sputtering economy and a perception among some voters that president @entity119 failed to meet the high ( and perhaps unrealistic ) expectations they had for him			1
according to @entity122 , the so - called millennial generation -- mostly people now in their twenties -- are the only age group to show a significant drop in whether they " care a good deal who is elected president next year , " from 81 % in 2007 to 69 % in 2011			0
@entity131 , a political science professor at the @entity132 , credits distrust in government with the substantial percentage of @entity137 citizens who would rather spend hours creating a viral campaign video than cast a ballot			2
" i think because of their cynicism and lack of control , they would rather do something direct , " said @entity131 , author of " @entity141 : how a @entity148			0
" " the paramount objective [ of the game ] is to get young people to register to vote , " said @entity1 's @entity149			1
being a savvy spectator wo n't be enough to win the game , he says			0
players will need to keep abreast of the latest news , register to vote via a streamlined application on the @entity157 website and exert subtle peer pressure on their fence - leaning friends			2
they also earn points by checking in at town halls and voting stations via @entity163			0
the details of the game wo n't be finalized until the private beta launch around june , but @entity79 is the likely hub of " @entity11			1
" the invite - only beta will give @entity1 's " @entity170 " team some room to tweak the game before its public debut in late summer or early fall			1
@entity17 expects @entity1 will leverage " hundreds of thousands of dollars " in prizes to fuel sustained enthusiasm for the game			1
big - ticket items will likely be a coveted invitation to the network 's annual @entity178 or an invitation to an inaugural ball next january in @entity182			0
@entity184 political science professor @entity183 says he 's skeptical that " @entity11 " will motivate young people who are not engaged with the political process			1
he believes face - to - face interactions are the most effective way to increase turnout and that the game 's success will depend on whether its players experience the same kinds of emotions via @entity79 as older generations do through real - life conversations			2
" to people who are really only distantly connected , i 'm not sure the blandishment of @entity79 wall posting would necessarily be all that influential , " @entity183 said			0
but for someone 's inner circle of close friends , " @entity79 could be quite powerful			0
" even if @entity1 ca n't make @entity137 a huge voting bloc , @entity17 believes the network can still be influential			0
" we 're not going to solve the problems we face with voting alone , " he said			0
" if we as @entity1 can get them [ young citizens ] when they 're 18 and when they 're 22 , they are a long way on their way to being active and informed participants in our democracy from now on			1

@entity1 to launch game that rewards players for being informed about the 2012 elections
" @entity11 , " will measure each candidate 's " value " via an aggregation of data points
@entity1 hopes that highlighting noble political candidates will inspire young citizens to vote
