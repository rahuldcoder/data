-- this is starting to sound like a broken record , but once again , 2011 was an incredibly safe year for commercial air travel			2
in fact , there were only 373 fatalities on 18 scheduled passenger flights worldwide			1
considering that there are roughly 10 million flights per year in the @entity11 alone , this is a remarkable feat. looking at the @entity14 's database , we see that there were 106 " occurrences " of all kinds during the year worldwide			1
this number includes military and cargo aircraft accidents as well as airplanes on test flights			1
one of the accidents last year was actually with an illegal crop - dusting operation in @entity24			1
so this is pretty detailed			0
including all those various occurrences , 50 in total had fatalities ; many of the rest were things like edging over the end of the runway			2
but once we narrow that number down again to just scheduled passenger flights , we get 18			1
now , 18 fatal accidents still sounds like a lot			2
after all , could you imagine hearing about one or two major accidents every month ? most of these , however , probably never made the news here in @entity44			2
in the @entity11 , not a single passenger was killed in an accident on a scheduled passenger flight the entire year			1
there was one tiny scheduled flight that crashed in @entity50 , killing the pilot , but both passengers survived			1
a couple of bush flying accidents in @entity55 claimed three lives as well , but that was it for this immediate part of the world			2
but wait , were n't there some newsmakers in the @entity11 this year ? sure , you heard about the @entity63 that had the fuselage tear open at cruising altitude , but everyone walked away in good shape			1
( ok , maybe nerves were rattled			0
) the rest of the accidents happened in primarily developing areas			0
the worst offender over the past year has been @entity24 , where three accidents killed 56 people			1
this was in addition to several landing accidents that were not fatal and one major crash of a charter flight that killed an entire professional hockey team			1
though this does not make flying in @entity24 unsafe , it certainly was one of the hotspots that should cause alarm for @entity24 aviation officials			1
there were two accidents in @entity88 as well as one in @entity90			0
these were on airlines that have been put on the banned list by the @entity94 for being unsafe , so many people would n't even consider flying them in the first place			0
there was an accident on a domestic flight in @entity101 , one on a tourist flight in @entity103 , one on a prop in @entity105 and five on turboprops in @entity44			2
in @entity109 , there was only one , a turboprop that crashed in @entity112 in bad weather			0
you 're probably wondering what caused these accidents			0
as usual , none of these was caused by a single issue , but most of them were operating in challenging weather conditions at the time			0
in some of the more remote places in the world , they do n't have the same kind of weather detection systems or the conservative procedures that we have here in the @entity11 , and that can make a difference in the accident rate			1
looking through all this data , one thing is clear			0
flying remains an incredibly safe mode of transport			0
although there will always be an effort to get to zero accidents , that simply wo n't happen with something as complex as aircraft operations			0
but each year , more aircraft take to the skies , and the chances of something going wrong continue to drop .			0

in the @entity11 , not a single passenger was killed in an accident on a passenger flight
eighteen scheduled passenger flights had 373 fatalities in 2011
@entity24 was the worst offender , with three accidents killing 56 people
