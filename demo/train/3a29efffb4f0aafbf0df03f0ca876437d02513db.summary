-- the @entity1 has rejected a bill that would have revived plans to process asylum seekers in offshore detention centers in a highly emotional vote following the sinking of two boats packed with people in one week			1
senators voted down the legislation by 39 votes to 29 , after hours of heated debate that saw one politician break down in tears as she described the plight of one 15 - year - old boy 's journey from @entity19			2
soon after the vote , prime minister @entity20 announced that former defence force chief @entity22 would lead " an expert group " to determine the best way forward on asylum seekers , according to the @entity23			1
" i want to be very clear about the role of this expert group , " @entity20 said			0
" this expert group will receive the facts from @entity30 and beyond			0
they will be able at their option to receive briefings wherever they want to get those briefings from			0
they will be able to assemble all of the material to help them form their views			0
they will be able to consult as they see fit , " the @entity23 reported			0
the dilemma of what to do with thousands of asylum seekers who attempt the risky trip by boat to @entity47 each year has long divided the nation 's political parties , and its people			1
however , the sinking of two boats in the past week carrying more than 300 people lent the issue urgency ahead of parliament 's long winter break			1
more than 200 people were pulled from the sea near @entity60 , north of @entity47 , after the separate accidents			1
it 's not clear how many died because authorities do n't have an accurate count of how many people were on board the vessels			0
two years ago , @entity68 made a similar treacherous journey from @entity70 on a fishing boat packed with more than 70 other people seeking a new life in @entity47			1
he was just 15 years old			0
" we came direct from @entity75 to @entity60			1
there are a lot of ways , this is the short way but it 's very dangerous , " @entity68 said			0
" there were too many people on the boat			2
we did n't have any space to sleep			0
we did n't have enough life jackets			0
" the teenager left @entity87 with his family 's blessing ; his father borrowed money from his friends and his mother and sister sold their jewelry to raise $ 11,000			0
some was spent on flights , while half was paid to people smugglers for the 50 - hour boat trip			2
" i heard that there are a lot of human rights in @entity47			2
that 's why i decided to come to @entity47 , " he said			2
" but then i arrived in a detention center , i thought no , there are no human rights in @entity47			2
" @entity68 spent two months in detention on @entity60 before being transferred to a hotel in @entity110 , the @entity111 , which for a time was used as a temporary detention center			2
he stayed there for eight months before being granted a visa to stay			0
now 18 , @entity68 is learning @entity116 in @entity117 and is following the debate among the nation 's politicians as best he can , though he still ca n't understand why he spent so long in detention			0
" we did n't do anything wrong			0
we are not criminals , " he said			0
if the bill -- the @entity125 ( the @entity126 ) @entity127 -- had been passed thursday , it would have allowed @entity47 to send asylum seekers to @entity129 and the island of @entity131 in the @entity132 for processing			1
it also would have marked a revival of @entity20 's controversial " @entity136 , " a deal agreed with the @entity129 government to send 800 asylum seekers there each year for processing in exchange for 4,000 refugees to @entity47			1
the deal was ruled invalid last august by the @entity144 on the grounds that @entity129 has no legal obligation to protect asylum seekers , something required under @entity47 's @entity148			1
despite fierce opposition from the coalition and the @entity153 , the @entity149 of @entity150 narrowly passed the bill late wednesday , clearing the way for the @entity1 vote			1
the @entity153 said they were pleased the government had announced a multi-party committee to look into the issue , but said more could have been done			0
" the government could , today , have taken the pressure off these desperate people to get on boats by immediately resettling thousands of people waiting in @entity70 and @entity129 , properly resourcing the @entity167 and increasing search and rescue capability , " greens senator @entity160 said in a statement			1
the bill 's defeat leaves the country without an effective response to attempts by asylum seekers to enter the country			2
the expert group has been asked to report back before parliament resumes in mid- august , the @entity23 said			0
the number of boats attempting the journey rose dramatically after @entity182 's @entity181 defeated long - term @entity184 leader @entity183 in a federal election in 2007			1
during his time in power , @entity181 unraveled @entity183 's policies , including the " @entity189 , " which involved diverting asylum seekers to detention camps on remote @entity132 islands			2
the @entity183 policies were slammed by critics as inhumane , however supporters credited them with deterring large numbers of people from boarding boats to @entity47			1
" they were humane as they possibly could be in the circumstances , " shadow treasurer @entity199 told the @entity23 before thursday 's @entity1 vote			1
he said the coalition was pushing for a policy of turning back boats when possible , reopening the processing center on @entity131 and granting asylum seekers temporary protection visas			1
the coalition would never support the @entity129 " people swap , " he added			0
since replacing @entity181 as @entity182 leader , @entity20 has adopted a tougher stance on asylum seekers but has resisted calls from the opposition to return to the @entity183 policies .			1
