-- there was n't much drama in @entity4 ' opening match at the @entity5 this year			1
last season at @entity11 , @entity9 @entity8 handed @entity4 her first loss in the first round of a grand slam tournament -- and @entity4 has been playing majors for a while , since 1999			1
@entity4 , uncharacteristically , blew a one - set lead as well as a sizable advantage in the second - set tiebreak before appearing to cry in her chair			1
@entity8 , cramping , withstood a late rally from @entity4 in the third set to extend the current no. 1 's struggles at the @entity5 , the lone grand slam the @entity26 has n't won more than once			1
on sunday as this year 's tournament began , @entity4 cruised past @entity29 's @entity28 6 - 0 , 6 - 1 to extend her winning streak to 25 matches			1
" it has n't been working out for me , " said @entity4 , referring to her past performances at the @entity5			1
" i just think i may have gotten nervous in the past or may have basically choked a few matches away			0
" some matches i just lost because maybe i was n't intense enough or maybe i did n't do enough work before i got here to the tournament			0
" @entity4 won over the crowd on center court by practicing her @entity9 , but most at @entity11 will likely be rooting for her next opponent , @entity42 , since she 's @entity9			1
@entity43 once led @entity44 , the reigning @entity5 champion , by a set and break at the tournament			2
the player @entity44 beat in last year 's final , @entity48 , also eased into the second round			2
the @entity50 downed slumping @entity52 @entity51 6 - 1 , 6 - 2			2
in men 's action @entity53 -- the @entity5 is the lone grand slam he has n't won more than once -- disposed of @entity59 qualifier @entity57 6 - 2 , 6 - 2 , 6 - 3			1
@entity53 , the owner of a men 's record 17 majors , made it look easy against @entity57 , who won seven straight tournaments at the lower level this season			1
" i felt good , " said @entity53			2
" he 's played many matches and won a lot this year - a lot on clay , by comparison with me			2
i knew it could be tricky if i did n't sustain a certain aggressiveness , get caught up in long rallies , maybe what he 's looking for			0
" i did well on the serve , on the return , on movement			0
clearly i 'm very pleased			0
am i a favorite to win here ? i do n't care , because it does n't give me any more opportunities to win the tournament			0
i just want to remain calm and let the storm go by			0
" @entity53 seemed to catch a break in the draw when he was put in the same half as fourth - seed @entity88 and not seven - time tournament winner @entity90 , the third seed			2
@entity88 , never into a grand slam final , recorded a straight - set win over @entity95 @entity94			1
@entity94 's veteran countryman , @entity96 , took part in the day 's most dramatic match , blowing a two - set lead and falling to @entity100 3 - 6 , 1 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 1 , 7 - 5			1
@entity100 originally held a 5 - 0 lead in the fifth			1
@entity96 , who lost his fourth straight encounter , continues to compete , despite hip problems			2
" physically i feel good			0
i was never going to play a lot of clay tournaments anyway , " the 32 - year - old former @entity106 champion said			0
" i wanted to be fresh physically and mentally for the grass season			0
i still trained extremely hard , though , so that was good			0
now we will see what happens on the grass			0
" @entity90 and @entity44 contest their opening matches monday .			0
