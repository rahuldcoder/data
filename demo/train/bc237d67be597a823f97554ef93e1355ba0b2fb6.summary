" i got off to a little bit of a slow start , but i was definitely in it , " @entity1 said in quotes carried by the @entity26 website after the match			2
" i was just physically grinding and trying to get in there and really just trying to grind out everything			0
" ( @entity2 's ) a really good returner and she was getting everything back , and making some good shots			1
it was n't just on the return , she was able to play some really good points after the return too			0
" she 's playing great tennis , even better than what she 's been playing in the last couple years , taking that defense and adding a lot of offense to it and going for her shots			0
she does both really well			0
" for her part , @entity2 was frustrated to lose but encouraged by how far she pushed @entity1 given her less than stellar record in matchups between the pair			1
" i did n't get many first serves in , " @entity2 said			2
" when i did , they were n't placed very well			0
" it 's frustrating , because you lose a match 6 - 4 in the third and you only hold serve once			1
i actually broke @entity1 three times in the set , too			2
i do n't think that really happens very often to her , either			0
" i felt like my game was there			0
