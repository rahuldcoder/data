@entity0 says @entity9 can send a powerful message of support for @entity13 minority in @entity1			1
( @entity14 ) -- in their latest communique regarding the fate of seven arrested members of the @entity13 religious minority in @entity1 , @entity15 has expressed grave concern they may face the death penalty if they are found guilty of the charges of " espionage for @entity24 , " " insulting religious sanctities , " and " propaganda against the system			1
" as the @entity30 of @entity1 experiences the most serious challenge to its legitimacy in its 30 - year history , the vulnerability of religious and ethnic minorities is the most accurate barometer of the crisis that all @entity1 face in these dire circumstances			1
of all the various @entity1 minorities , the @entity13 community historically has been the weakest and most vulnerable			1
the world 's attention is rightly drawn to the fate of prominent reformists charged with treason , and to the arbitrary arrest , torture , rape and murder of young @entity1			1
but the fate of the @entity1 @entity13 should not be eclipsed under the cloud of other civil rights abuses , for they represent much more than their own small community			1
minorities have always been at the mercy of belligerent authorities , particularly when they face a crisis of legitimacy			0
@entity66 in western @entity1 , @entity59 - speaking communities in the south , @entity61 in the north , as well as @entity63 and @entity64 in the east have been at the forefront of such discriminations , which has in turn instigated chronic separatist movements in these areas			2
at the same time , @entity1 zoroastrians , @entity73 and @entity74 have also faced varied degrees of discrimination , at official or cultural levels and registers , as they have joined their @entity80 brothers and sisters in opposing domestic tyranny and foreign intervention alike			2
among all these minorities , the @entity13 remain the most fragile in part because of @entity87 sectarian hostilities that go back to mid- 19th century and the rise of a vastly popular messianic movement known as @entity90 , of which the contemporary @entity13 are an offshoot			2
its adherents consider themselves the followers of an entirely new religion , in fact the very latest @entity1 monotheistic faith with over five million followers scattered over 200 countries			2
while other religious minorities are specifically protected under the @entity102 , this is not the case for the @entity13			2
@entity104 13 of the @entity105 has specifically and exclusively recognized @entity106 , @entity73 and @entity107 @entity1 as " the only recognized religious minorities , who , within the limits of the law , are free to perform their religious rites and ceremonies , and to act according to their own canon in matters of personal affairs and religious education			2
" the word " only " in this article seems specifically designed to exclude the @entity13 from this clause			2
having the same effect , @entity104 14 of the @entity105 stipulates the constitutional protection of the minorities to be exclusive to those " who refrain from engaging in conspiracy or activity against @entity127 and the @entity1			0
the location of the @entity13 holy sites in @entity130 , @entity24 , has been a principal source of harassment and intimidation against the @entity13			0
this goes back to the late @entity136 period and obviously predates the establishment of the jewish state in 1948			0
it 's also something over which the @entity13 have had no control			0
in the face of systematic abuse of civil liberties of the @entity13 , there is very little that the @entity146 government can do , particularly in the aftermath of the @entity149 presidency and eight years of widespread @entity150 in the @entity146 that did not leave even the last presidential campaign unscathed			1
having waged war on two @entity80 nations , the @entity146 government is in the least favorable position to defend the rights of @entity158 minorities in their own homeland			0
in addition , during the eight years of @entity149 presidency , and in the aftermath of the events of 9/11 , being a @entity80 became a liability in the @entity146 , creating pr problems even for president @entity166 's middle name			0
it was not until former secretary of state @entity169 came out strongly against such vilification of @entity80 that a prominent public figure put the problem on the national consciousness			0
as much as the @entity146 government is in the worst position to come to the @entity13 ' aid , @entity9 are perfectly poised to voice their outrage against the abuse of religious minorities in @entity1 or anywhere else in the @entity80 world , for they know what it feels like to be a political pariah and a religious minority in an overwhelmingly alternate context			1
since the terrifying events of 9/11 , @entity9 communities have endured much religious and racial profiling and suspicion , as they have seen the terms and icons sacrosanct to their faith maligned and ridiculed in @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194			0
multiply that experience many times and extend it back to the late 19th century and that would be the experience of the @entity1 baha'is , trapped inside their own homeland , banned from or exercising the terms of their own sacrosanct principles			1
the experiences of @entity80 as a minority here in the @entity146 , or in @entity192 for that matter , gives them a unique position to raise their voice against the abuse of @entity158 minorities in @entity1 and the rest of the @entity80 world			1
in a world now defined by the presence of multiple faiths inside many nations and as @entity146 @entity80 learn to come together to protect their own constitutional rights in an old democracy , it would only be fitting if they were to raise their voice in defense of other religious minorities seeking to secure their basic rights to religious liberties in countries aspiring to become democracies			0
the fate of @entity1 baha'is is not only a matter of their fundamental civil rights in the context of any republic , @entity127 or otherwise			1
it is the very cornerstone of democratic citizenship without which the @entity80 majority of @entity1 is denied their constitutional protection			0
watch the fate of the @entity1 baha'is carefully			1
the day they are free to practice their religion without fear , @entity1 at large will have finally secured their civil liberties			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity0 .			0

@entity0 : @entity242 on trial in @entity1 , perhaps for their lives
he says the @entity1 regime does *n't* support freedom for the @entity13 minority
he says @entity9 are in unique position to speak out for @entity13 in @entity1
he says when baha'is are granted liberty , all @entity1 will have civil rights
