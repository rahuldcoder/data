-- @entity1 and her husband , @entity2 , were shocked to discover they were expecting quadruplets in march			1
the couple have been married for four years and were looking to start a family			2
after trying unsuccessfully for some time to conceive , @entity1 underwent infertility treatments and received a double dose of @entity9 , which often results in a multiple - birth pregnancy			1
" when the doctors told us we were having quads , we were extremely terrified and ridiculously excited all at the same time , " @entity2 said			2
" it was just unimaginable			0
" @entity1 added , " i did n't know how to process it initially , but it felt like a blessing			1
" but their surprise turned to fear when doctors diagnosed 24 - year - old @entity1 with thyroid cancer four months into her pregnancy			1
" we were pretty overwhelmed when we found out , " @entity2 said			0
" we were lost and scared and did n't know what to do			0
" doctors had discovered an abnormality in @entity1 's thyroid during an ultrasound , and a biopsy diagnosed it as stage 1 cancer			1
the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes			2
" it was scary to find out about the cancer and thinking about what could happen , but if i stressed out about it , the babies would feel it , and i could possibly go into labor even earlier , " @entity1 said			1
" @entity40 was not an option , and our doctors were so reassuring that we just held on to that			0
" multiple - birth pregnancies are often complicated , said @entity1 's doctor , @entity45 , a high - risk obstetrician at the @entity46 in @entity47			1
as a result , @entity1 wanted to wait until after the babies were born at 30 weeks to undergo cancer surgery			1
she delivered one boy and three girls , two of them identical twins , on august 26			0
her surgery , a seven - hour procedure that included a thyroidectomy and lymph node removal , took place a few weeks later and was successful			1
@entity58 has seen thousands of patients , many with higher - order ( three or more fetuses ) pregnancies			0
she said it is not uncommon to diagnose cancer in pregnant women because that 's often when they have their first extensive health examinations			2
what 's scary is that the cancer may have been lying untreated -- and spreading -- for years			2
" @entity1 has probably had that cancer for several years , and it went undiagnosed , probably because with her young age , " @entity58 said			1
" the doctors missed the warning signs			0
" according to the @entity73 , thyroid cancers are a highly curable form of cancer , with an overall survival rate of 97.5 % over a five - year period			1
" in cancer -- which is always unfortunate -- @entity1 is fortunate that she had a form of cancer that was slow - growing and was n't going to be altered by the course of pregnancy and could be managed , " @entity58 said			1
the @entity82 are now waiting for @entity1 's test results to come back to determine a treatment plan			1
she may require a combination of both chemotherapy and iodine radiation , or just iodine radiation			0
either way , she and her doctors would like to postpone treatment for as long as possible -- without putting her health at risk -- so that she can continue to breast - feed the quadruplets			0
six weeks after her cesarean section and nearly one month after cancer surgery , @entity1 is recovering and the babies are growing			1
@entity98 , her son , is expected to come home from the hospital this week			0
identical twins @entity102 and @entity104 each weigh five pounds , and @entity105 is the smallest of their girls , weighing in at just under five pounds			0
they will remain in the @entity46 until they are full term to make sure they can breathe on their own and there are n't any complications			0
the girls are expected to return home before @entity114			0
@entity2 said he is excited about the babies coming home and not at all intimidated by thoughts of four babies crying simultaneously , or of all the diapers to change			2
the only fear that lingers is " having something happen to them and their health when there are n't a thousand nurses around , " he said			0
the couple said they are optimistic about what lies ahead for their family , but do they see more babies in their future ? @entity2 laughs and says , " i will tell you no more ; she will tell you maybe			2
but it 's definitely no for me			0
