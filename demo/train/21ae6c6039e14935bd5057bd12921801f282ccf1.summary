@entity1 's unique white dolphins -- famous for the actual pink hue of their skin -- face going from endangered to extinct -- with conservationists doubtful they can be saved			1
" we 've seen alarming decline in the last decade -- 158 dolphins in 2003 , just 61 dolphins in 2012 , " says @entity6 , chairman of the @entity7			1
" we are at a critical juncture on whether we can help the dolphins , " adds @entity6			0
" i have no idea whether they will keep going down and down -- but what i do know is we need to work urgently to come up with solutions to clean up the dolphin 's habitat			0
" land reclamation for massive engineering projects , resulting water pollution and boat strikes have exacted a heavy toll on the white dolphin population , which is mainly found in the waters of @entity27 's @entity26 in southern @entity1			1
in 2016 , the first automobiles are expected to roll across the 42 - kilometer @entity29 , respectively connecting the @entity31 financial hub with the @entity1 mainland 's " special economic zone " and the world 's gambling capital			1
now under construction , the world 's longest cross-sea bridge and tunnel link will go " right through the heart of the dolphin population , " says @entity6			1
" there will be lots of piling activities to construct the bridge			0
" by 2023 , @entity27 aims to complete a third runway for @entity47 international airport , already one of the world 's busiest			2
in the absence of soil on which to build , 650 hectares of land -- an area more than 5,000 @entity52 - sized swimming pools -- will be reclaimed from the sea			0
the area is also prime habitat for the @entity1 white dolphin			2
the @entity27 government has also proposed four additional land reclamation projects in dolphin - populated areas that aim to increase the amount of land on which to build in order to bring down the high cost of housing , adds @entity6			0
yet , despite @entity27 's plans for numerous engineering projects that will impact the white dolphins ' habitats , the founder of the 10 - year old @entity7 says he " actually applauds " the government 's conservation efforts			1
" i do n't doubt their desire to conserve , " explains @entity6 , who adds that the @entity27 government has provided more than $ 1 million @entity27 dollars ( us $ 125,000 ) each year for environmental research funds , set up a marine protection park for the white dolphins and helped monitor dolphin population numbers			2
" but it 's the other bureaus who want to push economic projects " including @entity27 's @entity82 and the @entity83 , says @entity6			0
" the economic departments are more influential so our voice for conservation work is drowned out by the voice for construction			0

@entity1 's white dolphin population has fallen more than *60* *%* from 2003 to 2012
@entity7 chairman says fall is " alarming decline "
