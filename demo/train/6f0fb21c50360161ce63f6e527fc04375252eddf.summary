four weeks away from the 2014 midterm elections and even some @entity2 operatives struggle to imagine a scenario where they retain control of the @entity5			1
the terrain and current momentum seem all but overwhelming and against them			2
a new @entity11 / @entity10 poll out thursday morning suggests a @entity13 lead over a @entity2 incumbent , this time in @entity15 , and does nothing to calm @entity2 ' nerves			1
" if you put a gun to my head , i guess i 'd say that we 're going to lose the @entity5 , " one @entity2 consultant told me in a moment of anonymous candor			1
it 's not even so much that president @entity27 is an @entity28 around their necks , though he is			0
" i love the guy and i do n't think there 's anything he could do to fix it , " the @entity2 operative says , " but he 's a real drag			1
but the bigger drag is the economy overall -- even though the economy is getting better , people are n't feeling it because wages are stagnant			0
" related : @entity13 challenger leads in @entity15 the other issue is that many of the @entity2 defending their seats in @entity13 - leaning states had a fresh new @entity27 in 2008 helping to sweep them into office -- and often then , just barely			1
the class of 2008 were a bunch of @entity27 babies -- and now that 's working against them			0
it 's hard to explain to youngsters , but in 2008 then - sen. @entity27 won @entity54 and @entity55 and almost even won @entity56 and @entity57			0
millions of @entity58 turned out to vote for him and in doing so in red states boosted democrats like sen. @entity62 in @entity15			2
@entity62 only beat then - sen. @entity63 , 47.9 % to 46.7 % six years ago			0
@entity62 has hovered in the low 40s in recent polling ; he trails his @entity13 opponent @entity66 by six percentage points among likely voters in the @entity11 / @entity10 poll out thursday morning			0
@entity5 math is hard for democrats the basic math , for those of you not as fixated as the rest of us , is the following : the @entity13 needs to win at least six seats ( though the number may end up being seven given the weirdness in @entity80 -- more on that later			1
) @entity13 start off basically half way there			0
@entity56 , @entity84 and @entity85 -- where three incumbent democrats have said farewell -- are considered easy @entity13 pickups , with the @entity13 candidates ahead in polls by double digits			2
that leaves seven competitive @entity5 races where @entity2 are playing defense : solid red states @entity15 , @entity96 , and @entity97 ; and blue - ish @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , and purple - ish @entity55			1
democrats are feeling cautiously bullish about exactly two of these races , sen. @entity102 , @entity104 , and sen. @entity105 , @entity106			1
@entity105 is instructive in this way , she currently polls at 44 % against her @entity13 opponent @entity109 , with 40 %			0
as @entity27 squeaked in a 49.9 % -49.5 % victory against sen. @entity111 , @entity112 , for @entity55 in 2008 , @entity105 defeated then - sen. @entity113 , @entity114 , 52.7 % to 44.2 % , and @entity55 elected a @entity2 governor and handed @entity2 victories in eight out of 13 @entity118 races			1
four years later , @entity119 opted for @entity120 , a @entity13 governor , and @entity2 were down to four out of 13 @entity58 @entity118 seats			1
@entity105 could certainly pull out a win this november , but it wo n't be because she 's riding a wave -- it will be because she successfully fought against it			0
related : key senate races here is the obligatory " to be sure " paragraph : each race is its own individual microcosm , incumbents have advantages challengers do not , four weeks is a lifetime in politics , @entity134 , insert clich√© here			1
the @entity136 , @entity137 , has a competitive race in @entity139 , though i know few @entity2 who think he wo n't eke it out at the end of the day			1
and @entity80 is a weird one , with the @entity2 candidate having withdrawn , and @entity144 sen. @entity144 facing an independent challenger who has n't said with which party he 'll caucus			1
@entity2 are hoping if the final vote comes down to @entity148 , he 'll remember that @entity2 cleared the field for him			2
a @entity11 / @entity10 poll out wednesday showed the race in a virtual tie with @entity144 just one percentage point ahead			0
related : @entity144 rebounds in @entity80 poll the @entity2 operative noted that his party was benefiting from some @entity13 struggles , namely the @entity13 's inability to raise as much money as it had wanted to , infighting among @entity159 , and general infighting among conservatives			2
" but midterm elections are generally more difficult for the party that holds the @entity118			2
and opposition to @entity165 appears to be a motivating factor for a lot of voters			0
" a lot of these races are tight right now , but this is n't the sort of environment where late - deciding voters are going to break for @entity2 , " the @entity2 consultant said , adding that with @entity2 in tight races but under 50 % right now , it 's tough to imagine all of them breaking in favor of the party that holds the @entity118			1
those democrats include the ones fighting for their jobs in all seven of these toss - ups			2
remember that the @entity13 only need win three of these and the most recent polling , which could clearly change between now and election day , suggests extremely close margins or a @entity13 advantage in all of them : @entity15 ( @entity13 up 50 - 44 in @entity11 / @entity10 poll ) @entity96 ( @entity13 up 45 - 41 in @entity192 / @entity191 / @entity190 poll ) @entity97 ( @entity13 up 47 - 41 in @entity192 / @entity191 @entity190 poll ) @entity98 ( @entity193 up 48 - 45 in @entity192 / @entity191 / @entity190 poll ) @entity99 ( 42 - 42 draw in @entity196 poll ) @entity100 ( @entity193 up 48 - 41 in @entity192 / @entity191 / @entity190 poll ) @entity55 ( @entity193 up 47 - 45 in @entity199 / @entity198 poll ) " it 's going to be bad , " the consultant said			0
" not 2010 bad , but bad			0
" even hapless @entity118 @entity13 candidates running against popular incumbents are proving competitive , the consultant reports			0
" you can see why @entity207 went down -- people are just so @entity209 , and that 's particularly a problem with @entity2 because of ties " to the president			2
" people feel hopeless and think that @entity165 is n't doing anything			0

@entity2 are on defense in seven key senate races
they are all but sure to lose three seats where @entity2 are retiring
some democrats *privately* admit it is going to be very difficult for them to keep control of the @entity5
