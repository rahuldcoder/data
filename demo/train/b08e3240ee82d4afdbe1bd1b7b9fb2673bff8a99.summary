@entity0 , @entity1 -- in his hectic , noisy laboratory at the @entity1 , @entity3 is wary when it comes to assessing whether @entity7 's suggested repair of sticky gas pedals will have any real impact			1
" they are in a bit of a quandary , " said @entity3 , a professor at @entity1 's @entity10			2
" if they announce that electronics is a problem , they are probably going to be in a lot of trouble , because nobody 's going to drive the car			1
so at this stage , they do n't want to announce there is any electronic problem			2
" but according to @entity3 , who is an expert in failure analysis and has written a book on sudden acceleration in automobiles , complicated electronics -- not a mechanical issue with the gas pedal -- lie at the heart of @entity7 's problems			1
and three other independent safety analysts contacted by @entity2 also conclude that neither floor mats nor stuck gas pedals are an overwhelming issue			0
" from what people have told me about their sudden acceleration incidents , most of them have have got nothing to do with the sticking pedal at all , " said @entity39 , an electronics consultant in @entity40 , @entity41			0
@entity39 said electronic throttle controls , which largely have replaced mechanical accelerators , can malfunction in ways he compared to an occasionally disobedient child			2
" we 've all had that type of experience , and i 'm afraid that is the sort of experience that can happen with any piece of electronics , with an electronic throttle , " he said			1
and @entity61 , who runs a company called @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity65 , said , " @entity7 's explanations do not account for the share of unintended acceleration complaints that we have examined			1
" @entity7 officials dispute any assertion that the complicated array of electronics in its cars has an impact on the acceleration issues that have dominated headlines in the past weeks			1
" after many years of exhaustive testing by us and by other organizations , we have found no evidence of an electronic problem in our electronic throttle control systems that could have led to unwanted acceleration , " said @entity78 , @entity7 's spokesman on quality - control issues			1
but experts like @entity39 say the tests conducted by @entity7 are not adequate			1
" those tests do not reproduce what actually happens in everyday life , " @entity39 said			0
" they are testing for certain conditions , for certain standards , but they test , for example , signals one at a time			0
they do n't do a whole lot of signals altogether			0
whereas in a car , you 've got a great cacophony of electromagnetic interference going on all the time , and you really ca n't rely on testing of a single frequency at one time			0
" as for the @entity112 government 's testing of @entity7 's problems , the man in charge of the @entity108 , @entity109 , said that a 2007 test on a @entity115 -- a @entity7 brand -- by the @entity117 to find possible electronic interference was amateurish			1
" they did n't do any real testing , " he said			0
" for all i know , they just took a garage door opener , pointed it at the engine compartment and snapped it , and that 's electronic interference to see whether or not anything happened			2
they closed the hood , and off they went			0
" @entity132 : @entity134 owner stands by his car efforts to contact the @entity137 in snow - bound @entity138 were unsuccessful			0
but @entity7 spokesman @entity78 said , " it 's very easy to look from outside and say , ' there is no problem with the pedal			1
' but this is the problem and we are fixing it			0
" @entity78 said the company " invited " further testing and pointed out that @entity137 officials announced a " fresh look " into the whole area of electromagnetic testing , not simply limited to @entity7 .			2

they say complicated electronics , not mechanical issue , are problem
@entity7 officials say they 've found no evidence of electronic problems
some say *automaker* 's tests are *inadequate*
