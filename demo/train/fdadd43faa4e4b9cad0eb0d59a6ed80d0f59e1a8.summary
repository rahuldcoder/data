@entity0 -- the lines to get a seat inside @entity4 started forming before 8 a.m. by then the sun was already high and the air thick			0
many of the elderly who arrived early for monday 's funeral retreated to the few pockets of shade around the rim of the building , while a handful of younger women used their sunday hats as fans			1
the few men who bothered to put on suit jackets joked about a change of heart			0
their smiles , framed by streams of sweat , greeted friends and strangers alike			0
it would appear that after protests , riots , tear gas and rubber bullets in @entity33 gripped national headlines for a week , this @entity28 summer waited until cooler heads prevailed before unfurling one of its hottest days			1
" i just want peace , girl , peace , " i overheard a woman saying			1
" @entity44 , @entity45 , " was the reply			0
the word " peace " was heard a lot during @entity50 's homegoing			1
for many , this was a day of peace because there were no protests			1
i find that notion misguided			0
for to pin all of the events that have brought chaos over the past two weeks on officer @entity58 firing six bullets into an unarmed 18 - year - old is to oversimplify a much more complicated problem			0
blacks in and around @entity33 have felt targeted by police and disenfranchised for decades			2
they are overrepresented in police stops and arrests and underrepresented as police officers and lawmakers			2
they have been frustrated by this dynamic since long before @entity50 was born -- so no , it is not this day that would confer peace , no matter how many hugs and smiles came with it			1
that 's because nothing has changed			2
it might have been a day devoid of violence in these streets , but the unrest within the souls of the people who walk them remained			2
how can there be peace ? the power structure must change			1
and when you know that just 6 % of eligible black voters made it to the polls in the last municipal election in a city that is nearly 70 % black , where to start that change is clear			2
" we have got to vote , " said @entity96 , a mature woman , who arrived early because , she said , " i needed to be here			0
" " there is not a whole lot we can do to fight this injustice if we 're not willing to make our voices heard			0
and the main way to make our voices heard is by voting			2
" her friend , @entity105 , agreed			0
" i 'm originally from @entity107			0
i can remember when they used to charge us $ 3 to vote			0
and you had to pass a test			0
and if you did n't pass that test , you could n't vote , " she said			2
" now the young people do n't even bother voting and it 's holding us back			1
all of this protesting -- this boy 's death will mean nothing if we do n't start doing what we can to change the way things are			1
" makeshift voter registration booths had popped up around @entity33 , most notably at the burned - down @entity124 which has served as ground zero for protesters , and another near where @entity50 was shot and killed			1
but signing up is not the same as following through			0
and following through does not guarantee a slate of candidates who are sensitive to their constituents ' needs			0
the day of @entity50 's funeral may have been without violence , but that should not be mistaken for peace			1
" i vote , but many of my friends do n't because they think it does n't matter , " said 21 - year - old @entity136 , a native of @entity33 who said he recently graduated from @entity137 and is starting graduate school at @entity139 this fall			2
he said he did n't know @entity50 but came to his funeral because " he could 've been me			1
" " the thing is , my friends think the system is n't looking out for them			2
and it 's hard for me to argue with them when so many things around support what they are saying , " @entity136 said			2
" but i do n't think anything in @entity33 is going to change unless black people start voting			1
" a statement that is as true as it is sad and frustrating			0
so much blood was shed to fight for the black community 's right to vote and too many of us choose not to -- still			1
it 's hard to point an angry finger at an unjust system when we surrender any power that we have to change it			1
though on this day , there are signs that true peace may be on the horizon here			2
the oppressive heat drew plenty of complaints , but it did not stop the people from coming			2
so when the pews of the sanctuary were full , church greeters directed those who came to pay their respects to @entity50 and his family to the overflow building next door			1
and when the designated overflow area was full , the community was sent to the gymnasium , where a sea of folding chairs waited			0
and when that was full , people were sent across the street to another overflow area where the funeral was being broadcast on portable screens			1
more than 4,500 came to say goodbye to @entity50 , many of whom did not know him personally			1
if that energy can be converted into political power , who knows ? maybe peace is n't that far away			1
" i 'm here because i believe we can turn things around here , " said @entity201 " we 've got to			0
it 's not up to white people to make things better for us , it 's up to us			1
we 've got to care about each other more , look out for each other more , get involved			0
" @entity201 , who brought his family to the ceremony , was standing in front of one of the overflow buildings during my interview with him			0
afterward , i went inside			0
that 's when i saw a mural bearing @entity214 : but they that wait upon the @entity45 shall renew their strength , they shall mount up with wings as eagles , they shall run and not be weary ; and they shall walk and not faint			0
that 's what the people of @entity33 must do when the cameras are gone			1
the tears have all dried			0
whether @entity58 is indicted or not , they must run and not be weary			0
vote -- lest the outrage that followed @entity50 's passing be for naught , and true peace remain unattainable .			1

@entity235 : at @entity50 funeral , people spoke of peace , but that 's more than no protests
he says black community 's underrepresentation , targeting by police are *longstanding*
peace ca n't come until that 's solved , he says , and voting is the way to do it
4,500 people attended funeral ; turn that energy into political power , he urges
