@entity0 -- if nothing else , the latest @entity3 act of barbarism brought a quick political consensus , and added pressure on president @entity8 : caution in the face of repugnant horror just wo n't do			1
the president responded wednesday in his first public remarks since the beheading of journalist @entity15			2
he promised results while pleading for time to deal with @entity19 terrorists in @entity20 and @entity21			0
" our objective is clear : that is to degrade and destroy @entity3 so it 's no longer a threat , " @entity8 said during a news conference in his trip to @entity26			1
" it 's going to take some time , it 's going to take some effort , " he said			0
his comments came the day after lawmakers from both sides of the aisle called for action			1
" we must use every tool at our disposal , short of introducing ground forces in combat roles , to put an end to the threat they pose to our national security , " @entity37 sen. @entity36 of @entity38 said in a statement tuesday			0
@entity51 @entity50 sen. @entity49 , rarely on the same page as @entity36 , also called on @entity8 to respond , and quickly			1
" there is no disease that becomes easier to treat the longer you wait , " @entity49 said			0
but whether increased bipartisan pressure will translate into a dramatically new and bolder administration approach is an open question			0
" he is not going to plunge @entity65 into another trillion - dollar social science project because two @entity65 journalists have been killed , no matter how horrific it is , " said longtime @entity61 hand @entity59 , now a scholar at the @entity63			1
@entity3 video shows beheading of @entity65 journalist still , given the second barbaric beheading in a few weeks and the growing political calls for more decisive action , @entity59 said , " you ca n't imagine him not responding in some way			1
" the rush of statements from politicians shared similar language calling for action and a better explanation of @entity65 policy			1
' let there be no doubt , we must go after @entity3 right away , " said @entity37 sen. @entity84 of @entity51 , the senior senator from the home state of @entity65 journalist @entity15			1
" it is long overdue for the @entity8 administration to present to the @entity94 , the @entity65 people , and our allies around the world a comprehensive strategy to respond to the horrific threat @entity3 poses , " moderate @entity50 sen. @entity90 said in a statement			1
what can the @entity65 do against @entity3 in @entity21 ? and sen. @entity101 of @entity102 , already among the @entity50 suggesting @entity8 has been too timid in responding to the @entity3 threat , said it was time to stop debating whether to use @entity65 air power against @entity3 leadership targets in @entity21			1
" condemnation is not enough to deal with this scourge			0
it is time we act decisively , " @entity101 said			2
the @entity50 hawk said airpower had proven to be effective against @entity3 targets on a limited basis in @entity20 and said now : " it 's a tactic that should be aggressively pursued both in @entity21 and @entity20			2
mr. president , if you ca n't come up with a strategy , at least tell us what the goal is			2
" the timing also adds to the pressure on the president			0
@entity3 released the video showing the purported murder of @entity15 as @entity8 traveled to @entity126 to attend a @entity128 summit , where responding to @entity3 is a top agenda item			1
@entity59 sees sad irony in the fact that a president who made a name for himself in politics with innovative uses of social media to communicate " is now forced to respond because of this cruel and savage use of it			1
" @entity8 ' cautious ' approach on @entity3 is panned as the commander in chief traveled , a top @entity61 official urged patience even in the wake of the apparent @entity15 beheading			1
" obviously , @entity3 is a very sophisticated organization , " deputy assistant secretary of state @entity145 told @entity1 's @entity146			1
" you can not just go in militarily and start dropping bombs , and hope that it 's going to work out			0
you have to have a very sophisticated approach to this			0
" in the short term , veteran diplomats and intelligence experts acknowledge the pressure on the @entity156 to respond with force will be intense , but they cautioned the menu of options might not be terribly appealing			2
" i 'm not sure there is a one - off airstrike or small set of airstrikes that would achieve much right now , " @entity59 said			0
" and i do n't think they are ready , in terms of identifying the targets , for a sustained and comprehensive set of strikes in @entity21 right now			0
" why a strategy to fight @entity3 in @entity21 will take time given that the options are hardly appealing , @entity59 said the president 's often - criticized caution makes considerable policy sense			2
" but his risk aversion is politically a disaster for him			0
" while mulling new military and diplomatic moves , @entity59 and others suggested a growing urgency for the president to set a speech or some other event to explain in detail the @entity3 threat and his deliberations			2
" it took 10 years to take down @entity188 , " @entity59 said			0
" given some of the advantages @entity3 has it will probably take 20			2
he will be handing off to the next guy or woman who is going to have to continue the fight			0
but he has got to figure a way to lay out a strategy , and explain the generational aspect			0
that is something a president needs to do			0
" apparent @entity3 executioner : ' i 'm back , @entity8 '			1

the second video of an @entity65 beheaded by @entity3 prompted fast calls for more action
*members* of @entity94 from both sides of the aisle urge president @entity8 to act quickly
experts say @entity3 is a sophisticated organization and more robust action may be *complicated*
