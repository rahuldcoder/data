-- @entity1 was one of the world 's top defenders -- now he 's turned his hand to defending the reputation of his former manager @entity6			1
the @entity7 , one of @entity10 football 's most successful leaders , has been criticized in recent months following @entity12 's dramatic downturn in form since his departure			1
over two decades , @entity6 won 13 @entity16 titles , two @entity17 crowns , five @entity18 and four @entity19			1
but after leading @entity12 to league glory in 2013 , a title won by 11 points , @entity6 retired and appeared to take his magic touch with him			1
under @entity24 , @entity12 capitulated in alarming fashion , finishing seventh and failing to qualify for @entity28 competition			2
however , some argued @entity6 had left his successor an aging squad , with the likes of @entity1 , now 35 , @entity33 , @entity34 -- two defenders who left @entity36 in the summer transfer window -- @entity38 and @entity39 all in their fourth decade			1
" i do n't understand how people can say that , " @entity1 , who left @entity36 at the end of last season , told @entity0 when asked whether @entity6 was responsible for @entity12 's failings			1
" you 've got some great players throughout the squad			0
you win the league by 11 points			0
you 've got to be a top team to do that			0
" so he goes and then it all falls apart			0
so that 's his fault ? how can people say that ? " @entity1 , who won 81 caps for @entity55 , arrived from @entity56 in july 2002 for Â£ 30m , a world record for a defender at that time , went on to win six @entity16 titles , the @entity17 and two @entity19			1
now at @entity60 , @entity1 was part of the @entity12 team which struggled badly last season under @entity24 , the man who was handpicked by @entity6 to succeed him			1
@entity24 was relieved of his duties after just 10 months in charge and was replaced at the start of the 2014 season by @entity69 coach @entity68			2
@entity70 has already made his mark by bringing in a number of high - profile players including @entity74 from @entity75 for a @entity10 transfer record fee of $ 98.7 million , @entity78 striker @entity77 on loan from @entity80 and @entity69 star @entity81			0
results have been mixed so far with @entity12 losing to the likes of @entity84 and @entity85 , as well as being humiliated by third - tier side @entity86 in the @entity87			2
two consecutive home wins over @entity60 and @entity89 have lifted @entity12 to seventh in the @entity16 table ahead of sunday 's clash with @entity92 at @entity36			1
with @entity70 struggling for defensive options and @entity94 , the midfielder , absent with a rib injury , @entity12 will once again by forced to field a changed line - up			2
@entity1 , who won six league titles with @entity12 , says the new manager needs time to ensure his new signings gel and come together			1
" it 's just about the new managers coming in and making that work together still , " he added			2
" do they want wholesale changes ? this manager seems like he wants to do that now			0
he 's changing , making big changes			0
he 's bought a lot of players in			0
" so i do n't think the buck stops with @entity6 at all			0
i think you leave and you win a trophy			0
" there 's not many better ways to go out than that			0

former @entity12 boss is regarded as one of the best managers in world football
@entity12 have struggled since the scot left in 2013
