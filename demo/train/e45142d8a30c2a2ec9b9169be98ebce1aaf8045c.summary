-- the @entity1 has halted discharge proceedings against a sailor who was found asleep in the same bed with another male sailor , according to a announcement friday by @entity7 , the nation 's largest organization of gay and lesbian troops and veterans			1
petty officer @entity12 , who is stationed at the @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , has said that the @entity1 's effort to discharge him for " unprofessional conduct " was a trumped - up charge based on the command 's suspicion that he might be gay			1
@entity12 also said the nonjudicial punishment for unprofessional conduct was a maneuver around the " do n't ask , do n't tell " repeal that president @entity23 signed into law in december			1
when contacted by @entity0 , @entity1 officials did n't have an immediate comment			1
@entity27 , executive director of @entity7 , said the @entity1 " undoubtedly did the right thing in reversing its decision , " made in march , to discharge @entity12 , who dozed off beside another male sailor while watching television on february 5			1
in a recent interview with @entity0 , @entity12 , a student at the @entity13 , said another male sailor stopped by that night and they both inadvertently fell asleep on @entity12 ' bed while they watched the @entity39 tv show " @entity40			1
" " we strongly suspected that his command was trying to find a roundabout way to discharge @entity12 because it suspected him of being gay , and we simply were not willing to stand by and watch a new version of ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' emerge under the new label of ' unprofessional conduct , ' " @entity27 said in a statement			1
@entity12 hired civilian attorney @entity49 , a former @entity50 officer who is one of the most experienced civilian military defense attorneys in the country , to fight his discharge , and @entity7 worked closely with @entity12 and @entity49 to help publicize the case and persuade @entity1 leaders to retain @entity12 , according to the @entity7 statement			1
in the @entity0 interview , @entity12 , 21 , said the other sailor had " come over to watch shows in the past			2
" his roommate walked in around midnight , @entity12 said			2
" my roommate walked in and it woke me up , " @entity12 said			2
he then woke up his friend , navy petty officer @entity64 , who , according to @entity12 , immediately left the room			1
the @entity1 had sought to discharge @entity12 under charges of " willful failure to exhibit professional conduct , " @entity49 told @entity0 in a recent interview			1
" it is a violation of the @entity71 for sailors to act unprofessionally in the barracks			0
it is considered unprofessional conduct to share the same bed in @entity1 barracks , " @entity74 , a spokesman for the @entity13 , said in an interview published in march			1
the @entity1 has denied the separation proceedings are based on the suspicion of homosexual behavior			2
" @entity13 is not administratively processing either of these sailors for separation based on sexual orientation , " @entity74 said			0
@entity12 , who says nothing sexual happened , said that they were both clothed -- him in pajama pants and a white t - shirt and @entity90 in boxers -- and that they were not under the covers together			2
@entity12 was lying above the covers , while @entity90 was below them			2
the play - by - play given by @entity12 is substantiated by the naval investigating documents , although a different account of the amount of clothing worn was given by @entity12 ' roommate , who said in his naval statement that both sailors were dressed only in their boxers			0
@entity12 ' roommate , who was made uncomfortable by what he saw , moved out of the room a day later and reported the incident to command officials , @entity49 said			0
an investigation was launched , ending with the command attempting to punish @entity12 and @entity90 by a captain 's mast , a nonjudicial procedure meant to avoid a court martial			0
@entity90 , who declined to comment on the case , accepted the mast and punishment , but @entity12 refused , moving the @entity1 to begin proceedings to discharge him			1
punishment by captain 's mast could have resulted in loss of rank or forfeiture of pay , or it could have jeopardized @entity12 ' top secret security clearance , @entity49 said			0
" i 'm not pleading guilty to something that i did n't do			0
i did not commit a crime , " @entity12 said in a recent interview			0
" i am the type of person that takes responsibility for my actions			0
if i break a rule , i take my punishment			0
and i know i did not break any rules			0
" @entity12 said he wants to become a nuclear operator on an aircraft carrier or a submarine			0
@entity0 's @entity139 and @entity140 contributed to this report .			0
