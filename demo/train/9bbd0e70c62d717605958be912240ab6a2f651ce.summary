-- we all know about the @entity3 states leaving the @entity4			1
but that was far from the only secessionist movement in @entity8 history			1
here are some rebellious regions you wo n't find in too many history books			1
this map shows some rebellious regions that have tried to seceed from the @entity8			1
the @entity14 @entity15 , a small island in @entity16 , became the home of @entity19 leader @entity18 and his followers -- called @entity21 -- in 1848			1
two years later , @entity18 declared himself king of the church -- complete with crown , scepter , robe , and a harem of 15 wives			1
however , most of the island 's inhabitants were his followers , so he essentially became @entity33 of @entity15			1
the power got to his head , and he began forcing his rule onto the non-believers , causing some violence between the two factions			1
in 1856 , the @entity40 pulled into the harbor and invited @entity18 aboard			1
as he was walking towards the ship , he was shot in the back by disgruntled followers , who then ran up the gangplank and escaped			1
adding to the mysterious circumstances , the assassins were set ashore on nearby @entity48 and never charged for their crime			1
shortly after the assassination , angry mobs from surrounding islands eventually forced the @entity21 from their homes , thus ending the short - lived @entity14			1
the state of superior concern over a perceived lack of interest from the @entity16 state government , the people of the @entity56 ( @entity56 ) , affectionately known as " yoopers , " have been trying to secede and form the state of superior since as far back as 1897			2
the movement gained momentum after 1957 when a bridge connecting the @entity56 region to @entity67 made it easier for southern " trolls " ( people who live " below the bridge " ) and @entity61 to mingle			1
this animosity continued into the mid- 1980s , when 20,000 signatures were collected and submitted to the state for a secession request			2
however , the number was shy of the 36,000 required , and the request subsequently denied			2
the secessionist drive lives on today , as numerous grassroots organizations are trying to muster support for another official attempt at an independent @entity56 until that day comes , though , the @entity61 and @entity69 will just have to try to get along			1
the @entity82 @entity82 , @entity83 , was a mining town founded in 1849 by the @entity85 of @entity86			1
as the town 's population rapidly exploded to 3,000 , lawlessness was on the rise -- and the @entity8 government was not much help squelching the rampant crime			2
@entity0 : three controversial maps additionally , a new federal tax on mining operations added fuel to the region 's civil unrest			2
seeing little support from @entity102 , on april 7 , 1850 , the townspeople voted to secede from the @entity4			1
but just three months later , as the @entity103 approached , @entity82 wanted to have a celebration ( which seems odd considering they were no longer technically @entity8 )			2
when nearby @entity106 would n't sell liquor to " foreign miners , " it was decided that maybe @entity8 was n't so bad after all			2
the townspeople voted themselves back into the @entity4 on the very same day and the party went off as planned			1
the @entity111 in the early - 1980s , the @entity8 @entity112 set up a checkpoint at the entrance to the @entity115 in an effort to stop illegal drugs and immigrants			1
the time to check everyone 's identification at the checkpoint resulted in a 20 - mile traffic jam that turned tourists away , thus damaging the economy in the @entity115			1
after numerous legal attempts to have the checkpoint removed , on april 23 , 1982 , @entity127 mayor @entity126 declared the @entity115 were seceding from the @entity4			1
moments later , now - prime minister @entity126 symbolically declared war on the @entity8 by breaking a stale piece of @entity133 bread over the head of a man dressed in a @entity137 uniform			1
one minute later , @entity126 turned to the @entity138 in charge of the @entity8 @entity140 at @entity127 and surrendered , thus ending the @entity111 's @entity141			1
he then immediately asked for $ 1 billion in federal aid to help rebuild his war - torn nation 's economy			2
while officially the @entity82 only existed for one minute , the tongue - in - cheek spirit of the rebellion lives on			2
today you can buy @entity111 citizen and diplomatic passports ( both of which have been used for international travel , though they are not intended to be official documents ) and even an official flag of the republic ( complete with the awesome motto , " we seceded where others failed " )			2
the community has even minted a series of limited edition one - conch dollar coins that can be used as legal tender while in the @entity115			1
the state of @entity165 feeling that the @entity168 southern half of @entity169 was not working in conjunction with the rest of the state , a secessionist movement was launched by northern @entity173 in 1939 to create a new state that would better serve its more conservative population			1
this state , @entity165 -- so named after the nearby mountain range -- was to be made up of northern wyoming , southeast @entity179 , and the western region of @entity181			1
while the secessionist movement was never very large or pursued through legal channels , that did n't stop @entity184 , the street commissioner of @entity185 , @entity169 , from appointing himself governor of the " state			2
" the movement went so far as to press @entity165 license plates and crown a miss @entity165 beauty queen			2
@entity165 could even brag about a visit from a foreign dignitary , @entity193 of @entity194 ( though he was officially visiting @entity169 and just happened to be in @entity165 )			2
despite all of the hoopla , the state never came to be , and now , so many years later , the intent of the secessionist movement is in question			2
some believe there was a genuine attempt to create a new state , while others say it was just a fun way for cowboys to distract themselves during tough economic times			2
the state of @entity207 @entity83 and southern @entity208 have been trying to merge since 1852			1
the attempts have been met with mixed results , though the " @entity212 " movement of 1941 came closest to making it happen			0
the region felt it was being ignored by their respective state legislatures , so in response the people created the " @entity221 " to explore the possibilities of secession			0
the group began stopping cars on @entity224 to hand out the state 's " @entity225 , " a pamphlet outlining the grievances they held and the solutions they proposed			0
to help rally their cause , they developed a state flag made up of a gold miner 's pan with two black @entity238 's inside , representing the double - cross they felt the @entity208 and @entity83 state governments had pulled			1
@entity0 : @entity207 on december 4 , 1941 , judge @entity242 was elected governor of @entity207 in the state 's temporary capital of @entity246 , @entity83			1
the event was filmed by numerous newsreel companies who were set to air the footage during the week of december 8			0
history had other plans , as the @entity253 bombed @entity254 the day before the big premiere			0
driven by a sense of national obligation , the @entity207 secession was put aside and never really regained momentum			0
while the official movement might have died out , the residents of this region still hold the concept in their hearts , with many identifying themselves even today as the population of the great state of @entity207			0
the @entity267 @entity268 , @entity269 , located in @entity270 in the far southwest corner of the @entity269 , has been a popular tourist destination for many years			0
therefore , when the @entity274 left @entity268 off their annual " @entity276 " map in 1961 , the region was not happy pleased			0
to display their dissatisfaction , @entity270 drew up papers of secession and presented them to the state legislature , declaring itself the independent @entity267			0
the county went so far as to elect officials , form a territorial militia , and even printed up visas that were issued to visitors so they could travel throughout the territory			0
perhaps the most lasting impression were the thousands of @entity267 stamps that were printed and sold throughout the area			0
while most agree that the secession was done purely for publicity , the state of @entity269 was n't necessarily happy about the type of publicity it was garnering			0
so in order to end this mock rebellion , the state declared that state employee retirement pension payments would be suspended for @entity270 , all current state employees would be fired , and all state funding would be withheld			1
needless to say , @entity267 surrendered and returned to being simply @entity270 , @entity269 , once again			0
and here 's one more secessionist movement that 's been in the news this year			0
from 1995 to 2002 ( except for a few months in 2000 ) , @entity307 's @entity306 @entity306 was a member of the @entity308			0
@entity310 writer @entity309 has the story on the @entity308 : 8			0
@entity307 for decades , a well - organized separatist movement has campaigned to turn @entity8 's largest state into its own nation			0
the bitterness dates back to 1958 , when @entity307 's citizens were given a simple yes - or - no vote on statehood			0
many @entity307 felt they were denied more options on the issue , prompting a land developer named @entity323 to organize a re-vote that would offer @entity307 four possibilities -- remain a territory , become a state , take commonwealth status , or become a separate nation			1
using the vote as his platform , @entity323 ran for governor in 1974 -- and soon made a habit of it			0
with colorful slogans such as , " i 'm an @entity307 , not an @entity8			0
i 've got no use for @entity8 or her damned institutions , " @entity323 spearheaded the @entity308 ( @entity308 ) , and his campaign has twice topped 5 percent of the vote			0
@entity0 : nine modern - day independence movements more surprisingly , former @entity8 interior secretary @entity341 got elected governor on the @entity308 ticket in 1990			0
unfortunately for the party , @entity341 only ran on the ticket because he lost the @entity173 primary			0
never a supporter of the plebiscite idea , @entity341 left the @entity308 and rejoined the @entity173 in 1994			0
today , the @entity308 continues to draw about 4 percent of voters statewide			0
and in 2006 , @entity307 took part in the first - ever @entity350 , joining other groups from @entity352 , @entity353 , and the @entity181			0
as for @entity323 , he was murdered in 1993 -- reportedly the result of an argument over a business deal			0
on a brighter note , honoring his wish to never be buried in @entity8 soil , @entity323 was laid to rest in @entity362 's @entity361			0
