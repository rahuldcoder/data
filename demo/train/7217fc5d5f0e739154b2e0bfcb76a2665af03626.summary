@entity0 , @entity1 -- virtual life is around us every day , from online communities to simulation in computer games			1
it 's fun , but it 's also useful			2
the @entity11 military uses simulation technology to train pilots , soldiers who take part in convoys and medics , who are similar to civilian emergency medical technicians			1
new battery - operated , remote - controlled mannequins can simulate bleeding and breathing , and they have blinking eyes that dilate			1
medics can test their skills on these life - like mannequins			1
the new units , which are packed with technology , are used at 23 @entity27 as part of a program to teach lifesaving techniques to medics and nonmedical personnel			1
a @entity34 study says the training program has saved 1,000 soldiers ' lives in combat , said lt. col. @entity39 , manager of the @entity40			1
the centers -- originally designed to train medics and first responders before deployment to @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 -- became so good at saving lives on the battlefield that training was added to include everyday soldiers			1
the latest mannequins are anatomically correct and have life - like skin , allowing soldiers to practice lifesaving techniques to stop bleeding and start intravenous medications			1
a computer captures the medics ' actions to ensure that they take the right steps			1
" that simulator will breathe and bleed			2
and if it 's bleeding , you have to apply the proper pressure to stop or control the bleeding , or the simulator will die , @entity39 said			2
the training takes place over five days at military bases in the @entity11 and overseas			1
the last day is the toughest			2
in an exercise , a simulated bomb explodes inside a tent , and a soldier screams " help me ! help me ! " as a medic rushes to a man whose legs appear to be blown off			0
blood squirts from the mannequin 's severed limbs , which have exposed muscles and bone			0
the graphic scene includes soldiers lying on the ground with facial injuries			1
a tourniquet is applied to the mannequin 's legs , stopping the bleeding			0
the screaming soldier is an actor , lying on a cot , who has only the top half of his body exposed			0
the bottom half is the mannequin			0
" when you first walk in , it 's scary			0
it 's like , ' wow , this is real , this is training ? ' " said staff sgt. @entity99 , a medic with the @entity100 in @entity0			0
" then you get into the treatments , and that is like treating a real patient			0
" in 2007 , @entity99 was one of the first to take the course in @entity46 before deploying to @entity45			0
he 's now a medical trainer			0
advances in technology have been crucial to the training			1
a decrease in computer size , along with an increase in power , made devices such as the mannequins possible , giving them the ability to simulate bleeding and breathing			1
as computing power increases , so does realism and the clarity of simulators			1
one simulator used by the @entity126 teaches soldiers how to survive or avoid an ambush while traveling in a convoy			1
col. @entity130 , manager of the @entity131 , says military convoys are targets in @entity45 and @entity47			1
@entity130 recalls the story of @entity135			0
@entity136 , whose convoy in @entity45 was attacked in 2003			0
@entity136 was captured by @entity45 and rescued a week later by @entity11 forces			1
@entity130 uses @entity136 story to show the importance of simulators			2
the convoy tactical trainer is equipped with a hummer , a communication system and guns just like the ones used on the battlefield			0
" we suspend reality and immerse our soldiers in a synthetic environment that stresses them so their training comes in to play , " @entity130 said			2
" so when they are faced with it in the real world , they know how to respond because they have been there			0
" this tactical trainer is mobile , so it can " bring the training to the soldier versus taking the soldier to the trainer , " @entity130 said			0
a mobile trainer is flexible , and it also cuts down on expenses -- a requirement for today 's military , whose pockets are not as deep as they once were			2
most other simulators cost millions of dollars , require enormous computing power and are not very mobile			2
@entity174 's newest simulator can transform from a fixed - wing aircraft to a tank by just rebooting the computer software			2
the @entity179 's cockpit is made up of consumer touch - screen monitors that run off one gaming - quality computer with added graphics cards			2
the compact device can easily be shipped where the military needs to keep soldiers up to date			1
one device could fulfill the training needs of one base -- from truck drivers to aircraft pilots -- at a fraction of the cost of large simulators			1
" any time you can save money , " said @entity196 lt. col. @entity195 , director of operations for the @entity197 at @entity198 , who recently tried the device			0
" it 's the taxpayer 's money you are saving			0
" large - scale simulators costing tens of millions of dollars still have their place , despite their price tag , said @entity210 , president of @entity211 , which operates simulation training centers for military pilots			1
" we will still need our war fighters trained as our budgets get tighter and tighter , " he said			0
that 's because training in actual airplanes costs tens of thousands of dollars an hour in fuel , not to mention the added danger , he said			0
" you will see a shift from live training where soldiers and airmen go out to fly or go to the range to shoot -- some of that will be moved more and more to simulation , " he said			1
the modeling and simulation industry has responded to the military 's needs through increased simulation innovation in @entity235 , interactivity and emerging technologies , such as avatars , at a lower cost			1
@entity195 , who normally flies a @entity240 , tried out the simulation for a @entity243 tiltrotor aircraft , which is kind of a cross between a helicopter and a turboprop airplane			2
" i did n't crash , too often , " he said with a laugh			0
" and that 's the best part of a simulator , you know			0
you get to practice that sort of thing			0
if you make a mistake , you can hit the reset button ... " there 's no reset button in a real airplane			0

the @entity11 military uses simulation technology to train pilots , soldiers and medics
medics train on life - like mannequins that can simulate combat injuries
the mannequins have skin that bleeds and eyes that dilate
high - tech simulators are small enough to ship to soldiers in combat
