-- @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 -- all four coaches of " @entity6 " -- joined producer @entity7 , host @entity8 and the show 's social media maven @entity9 for a press conference sunday night at @entity7 's @entity14 home			1
looking out at the panoramic view of the @entity16 , @entity3 quipped , " so this is what reality tv buys you			1
" that , or maybe just knowing what makes for good tv			2
and @entity7 and his team have demonstrated a knack for spotting opportunities			2
last season there was shock among fans when singer @entity30 , one of the favorites to win the title , was eliminated by coach @entity4			1
even her fellow coaches expressed their disbelief			1
this season , which starts september 10th , they 'd be able to do something about it , thanks to a new element called " the @entity40 , " which allows judges to pick up a contestant who 's been ousted by another coach			1
journalists got a sneak peak at a recently taped battle round between two of @entity1 's competitors , who each delivered a smoking rendition of @entity52 's " @entity51			2
" as soon as @entity1 carried out the unenviable task of choosing just one , the other coaches hammered on their buttons and made their pitches to bring the loser onto one of their teams , just like they do in the battle rounds			1
judges can only pick two additional team members , which will lead to a new cycle of the show called " @entity69 , " where the teams will pare down before beginning the live episodes			1
the new opportunity for poaching has added a lot to the show , the coaches told @entity0			1
" it 's nice to throw those elements in to kind of spice things up , " @entity3 said			1
" those things definitely help keep it fresh for us			2
" it also adds more pressure , @entity2 said			2
" there 's nothing that 's more nervewracking than knowing , ' okay , both these singers did really good and i got ta pick one and i know damn good and well one of these other three are gon na steal the person i do n't pick , ' " he said			1
" there 's a chance that person may go on and win this and that 's gon na make me look really stupid			2
that definitely goes on in your mind			2
as an artist and somebody on television i have enough of an ego that i do n't want to look that stupid			2
i want to look brilliant			2
" ultimately , though , he recognizes it 's great for the show and viewers			0
" it 's going to be so exciting for people watching at home , " @entity2 said			0
" here 's the truth , as much as we want to sit up here and talk about how different this show is , and it is , what people love the most is those damn buttons			0
people love to see us hit those buttons and somebody 's life is changed at that moment			0
this is another way of changing somebody 's life later on in the show , where they think all hope is lost , they 're going home , the next thing you know the button gets pushed and they 're right back in the game again			0
" the new components add another element to what @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity2 call " the best season yet			1
" only @entity1 holds out on that , saying , " a few memorable things have happened thus far , but season three is n't completed yet , so i do n't know if this is the favorite season yet			0
" for the four coaches , though , the biggest strength of this season is their bond			1
in the first clip shown at the junket , the four are seen performing the @entity147 ' " @entity146 , " and they resembled a band , much more than they did in the combined performances of the first two seasons			0
what helped meld them into a tight , family - like unit is the way all four work with contestants , @entity4 said			0
" over time we see how each of us react as coaches , giving such heartfelt advice and attention to these up - and - coming young fresh talents and it 's so nice to see , " she said			1
" it 's refreshing because we came into it not wanting to knock anybody down and i think we all respect that			0
we might take shots at each other , but never the talent			0
so there 's just a magic , there 's a bond there that 's unbreakable at this point			0
" @entity2 concurred , recognizing the quartet is now joined together by the success of the series			0
" we 're always going to be connected to each other through this show , " he says			0
he admitted there have been some rough moments , like any family			1
" we 've been through a lot of s * * t with each other , no doubt , " he said			0
" we 've had fights , ups and downs and weird moments and f * * k - offs and all that stuff			1
but all friends go through that i think and you either go through it and you never speak to each other again or you go through it and your relationship is even stronger			0
we did n't have to come back together , but we did , and our relationships are stronger			0
" @entity3 agreed that the coaches have left the rockiest moments behind them			1
" we are getting along better than we ever have and i guess our energies have all congealed and we 're very , very close at this point , " he said			0
the show will run this year in both the fall and spring seasons , which could result in one or more of the coaches having to take a sabbatical to go on tour			1
although @entity7 said the coaches have their " chairs for live , " the assembled journalists were keen to speculate on who the replacement coaches might be			1
@entity1 shut down the speculation while nicely summing up the bond among the current four			0
" for me , there 's nobody comes to mind that can replace my @entity2 , my @entity3 and my @entity4 , " he said			1
