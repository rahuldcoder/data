-- the wedding photo shows the happy couple poised to kiss , ready to begin an adventure that has now taken them to the @entity6 @entity5			2
for @entity8 and @entity9 , this is a fight for recognition by the federal government of their legal same - sex union , part of a landmark constitutional appeal over same - sex marriage and " equal protection			1
" their love has united them , but the larger social issue has split the country for more than four decades			2
rulings in that and a related appeal over state marriage laws are expected from the high court wednesday			1
the @entity29 , couple were legally married last october -- but not in the eyes of some of their employers or elected leaders			2
@entity8 serves her community as a metropolitan police officer			0
@entity9 serves her country in the @entity37			0
but since she is a federal worker , the couple can not share the 1,000 - plus federal perks enjoyed by married heterosexuals -- joint tax returns , loan programs for veterans , and survivor , pension , bankruptcy , family medical leave and health insurance benefits			1
under the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) passed in 1996 , marriage is defined for federal purposes as between one man and one woman			1
that means the estimated 120,000 gay and lesbian couples legally married in nine states and the @entity29 are still considered -- in the eyes of @entity50 opponents -- the equivalent of girlfriend and boyfriend			1
@entity63 : big money at stake in same - sex marriage ruling " as a federal employee and as an airman , you get a constant reminder that you 're second class , " @entity9 told @entity0			1
" i had to list @entity8 as my sister just so that someone would call her in the event that i 'm killed or missing in action , or i 'm hurt on the job			0
she ca n't be my emergency contact , she ca n't receive my remains			2
as far as my death benefit , i had to list her as ' other			0
' " adding to the confusion is @entity8 's status as a @entity29 government employee			2
she enjoys the benefits of her relationship with @entity9 because her local government in the nation 's capital recognizes same - sex marriage			1
" but once we step outside of @entity29 , it 's a whole other ballgame , " said @entity8			0
in neighboring @entity91 , which does not recognize their marriage , the couple says they are viewed as " legal strangers			2
" the woman at the center of the case what is federal government 's role in defining marriage ? the larger debate over @entity50 's intent and impact 17 years after passage has driven a wedge between the executive and legislative branches			1
at issue is what role the federal government should play when it comes to marriage -- something states have traditionally controlled			1
challenging @entity50 : 5 things we learned " what the court is being asked to decide is whether or not @entity123 can pass a law that treats same - sex couples , who are already married under the laws of their state , different from opposite - sex couples , " said @entity118 , a leading appellate attorney and editor of @entity120			1
four federal district courts and two appeals courts have already struck down the law 's restrictive benefits provision			2
and in a rare move , the @entity136 administration also abandoned its defense of congressional authority , saying @entity50 is unconstitutional			1
that has left @entity141 in the unconventional position of stepping in to argue it should stay in place , at least for now			0
traditionally , the role of defending federal law would fall to the @entity6 solicitor general 's office			1
but president @entity136 , in an election - year stunner , said last may he now supported same - sex marriage			1
the president had already ordered attorney general @entity152 not to defend @entity50			1
that raised the question of whether any party could rightfully step in and defend the law			0
justices could put an end to hard choice for gay couples besides the constitutional issue , the justices had specifically ordered opposing sides to argue a supplemental question : whether congressional @entity169 -- operating officially as the @entity165 of the @entity6 @entity166 -- have " standing " or legal authority to make the case			1
" let 's not confuse the issue of @entity50 and the administration 's decision that it was unconstitutional , " house speaker @entity170 , @entity171 , told @entity0			1
" it is not their role to decide what 's constitutional			2
@entity50 was a law that was passed by the @entity166 and @entity181 and signed into law by president @entity183			1
in our system of government , the administration does n't get to decide what 's constitutional -- the @entity5 does			2
and our financing the lawsuit was to make sure the proper forum was used to make sure that we know what 's constitutional and what is n't			0
" supporters of traditional marriage agree			2
" @entity50 's important because @entity123 said it 's important , " said @entity195 , senior counsel at the legal ministry @entity196			1
" we sent our elected representatives to @entity29 , and they chose to say that marriage is one man and one woman for purposes of federal law			1
" and many conservatives argue the courts should stay out of the larger constitutional issues and let citizens and the legislatures hash it out			0
some activists worry nine unelected justices will issue a sweeping 50 - state mandate and redefine marriage as whatever personal bond they now think it is			1
@entity214 , chief counsel of the @entity215 , says nothing in the @entity217 tells states whether and how they should " evolve " on such an established institution			0
she said liberty is fundamental right , but that government also has broad discretion to affirm the idea marriage is mainly about ensuring biological children are raised in a stable two - parent family with a mother and father			1
same - sex marriage in the 21st century " is clearly not what anyone understood as marriage at the time of the framing of the @entity217 , " she told @entity0 , saying that should be enough to keep the high court out of the current case			1
gay couple fights for right to marry in epic high court case lack of protections , benefits if partner deploys @entity9 and @entity8 said they hit it off immediately after they met by chance at a downtown club 's @entity248 , and felt like they had known each other forever			2
they were together four years before marrying last october			0
@entity8 said she went to @entity9 's mother first to ask her daughter 's hand in wedlock			0
sitting in their comfortable @entity29 home , they appear blissfully happy being together , but @entity50 has put unexpected strains on the marriage because of " little frustrations			1
" for one thing , they worry what could happen when @entity9 gets sent overseas in a war zone			0
" technically , i am a single person deploying , " she said			0
" so i do n't have any protection for my family			0
i could deploy tomorrow and there would be nothing in place to help my family			0
it would be just me			0
so that 's definitely scary			0
financially , making sure that the responsibility that we have to each other and to our families is taken care of , and it would be like i 'm leaving @entity8 in a lurch			0
" @entity8 added : " it 's like we have to still go above and beyond just to get to where heterosexual couples already are			2
" they believe they are burdened by a triple social stigma -- as women , black and lesbians			0
the couple hopes to have children someday , but that would create further layers of what they say are discriminatory rules			0
for now this self - described " boring couple " say they look forward to the day their children would be born and raised in a @entity301 world			2
but regardless how the @entity5 rules , they say they will persevere			0
" i should be able to walk with my wife hand in hand and live our life			0
we should n't have to sit here on the edge of our seats , waiting for a decision , " said @entity8			0
" are we going to finally be able to just be recognized without any strings attached ? ... we 're humans , we live in a strange society , and we have to work with what we 've got			0
" @entity316 has a family : a same - sex couple 's remarkable journey @entity0 's @entity320 and @entity321 contributed to this report .			1
