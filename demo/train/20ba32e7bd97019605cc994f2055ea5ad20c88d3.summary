-- human beings can experience 34,000 different emotional states			1
but our research shows that in an average working week , most ceos experience just one dozen emotions across work and home life			1
those twelve emotions are mostly negative : being overwhelmed , frustrated , angry , disappointed , and fearful			1
when i quizzed 200 western ceos on the personal pressure they felt in their jobs , a typical response was : " i ca n't talk to the chairman because in the end he 's the one who is going to fire me			1
i ca n't talk to my finance director because ultimately i 'm going to fire him , and i ca n't tell my wife because i never see her and when i do , that 's the last thing she 'll want to talk about			1
" about half confided they find the job intensely lonely and do n't know who to turn to for advice			1
indeed , @entity27 's leave of absence from @entity29 this month illustrates how the stress of the ceo role can leave individuals ill. why is it so difficult at ceo level ? the day to day pressures of the job are intense			1
most ceos are at the mercy of their diaries , their businesses , the press and their shareholders			1
with the western economies entering a long , hard winter , and the rising competitiveness of eastern businesses , ceos in western countries face some of the harshest conditions of their careers			1
the long term personal toll can also be huge			2
one typical @entity54 ceo told me : " i have been married twice and have four kids and one grandchild			2
i ca n't remember the first two boys growing up when i was with my first wife			1
we separated when they were eight and nine			0
i ca n't remember them when they were young			2
" most ceos respond to this pressure -- and frequent self doubt -- by creating command and control systems			2
they take all crucial decisions , which are then meant to be executed lower down			0
the model depends on the ceo being an expert with good answers , typically based on their training as a finance director or deep commercial experience in their market			2
but the reality is almost all problems are channelled up to the top			0
so the ceo faces a huge burden			0
is life different for ceos in the east compared to the west ? i interviewed a hundred leading @entity88 entrepreneurs for my next book , and found the @entity83 are constantly near exhaustion			1
in contrast to western @entity83 they are tired not by a hard economic reality but because they have huge dreams			1
typically , they have not yet worked out how to manage the hyper - growth their dream and the booming market are creating			0
this can cause problems because businesses need the driving energy , strategic clarity , commercial grip and inspiration that a great ceo can provide if they are to deliver their full potential for their owners , staff , customers and society			0
tired professional managers and exhausted dreamers will not get the best from their businesses			0
in the current hard economic winter in the west and booming spring of @entity88 , inspiration and trust from the top will be vital ingredients in getting the best returns from businesses			1
how can @entity83 learn from different cultures ? being a ceo is a huge and complicated job , and each business needs a bespoke approach			1
but @entity83 can make a start with five steps : 1			1
western @entity83 should learn from the @entity88			1
what do you truly dream of building ? rediscover the excitement and thrill that drove you to the top in the first place			0
most ceos take too much direct personal control			2
it stifles those around you and it exhausts you			0
learn to build a fellowship you trust and who will deliver for you every time			2
rekindle the spirit of your business			0
@entity152 , founder and chairman @entity154 , arguably the most globally successful @entity156 business of the last 25 years , told me : " to me , leadership is primarily about raising the aspirations of people , making people say that they will walk on water			0
" use your dream to inspire your teams and businesses			0
share it with business partners to help you build trust			0
build a personal support system to ground you			0
make rules to safeguard your recharge time , reconnect with your partners and kids and stay healthy			0
get out of the day to day			0
the best ceos work on business as usual by exception , not as the norm			2
they maintain a tight grip of their business with robust systems and review but do not lurch from day crisis to day crisis			0
ultimately , @entity83 who are suffering need to find a new way of leading			1
in this high octane world , they can either work in a new way or burn out .			0

research shows @entity83 experience a dozen mostly negative emotions during an average week
many western ceos find the job intensely lonely , and do n't know where to seek advice
