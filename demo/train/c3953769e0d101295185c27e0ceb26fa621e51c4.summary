a newly disclosed @entity1 policy mandates that it wo n't use vaccination programs as part of its operations , according to the @entity7 administration			1
the directive by cia director @entity9 , made nine months ago but only coming to light now , followed concerns raised by leaders of a dozen @entity14 public health schools in a letter to president @entity7			2
they spoke out following revelations the @entity1 had enlisted a doctor to oversee a false immunization campaign in @entity20 ahead of the 2011 raid that killed @entity23 leader @entity22 in @entity24			1
the campaign 's true purpose was to collect information on the residents of the compound , and attempt to confirm @entity30 matches to @entity22 or relatives			0
the public health programs reached out to @entity7 after the organization @entity33 was forced to " withdraw all foreign national staff " from @entity20 as a " result of a @entity1 sham vaccination campaign			1
" @entity33 was in the midst of a campaign to administer the polio vaccination in @entity20 , one of the few places left in the world where the virus is still prevalent			2
in their letter to the @entity45 in january 2013 , the deans also alleged that " seven or more @entity47 health workers who were vaccinating @entity20 children against polio were gunned down in unforgivable acts of terrorism " as a result of the @entity1 effort			1
in a letter dated may 16 and obtained by @entity58 on monday , @entity54 , the top @entity45 adviser on homeland security and counterterrorism , told the health school deans that @entity9 had " directed in august 2013 that the agency make no operational use of vaccination programs , which includes vaccination workers			1
" similarly , the agency will not seek to obtain or exploit dna or other genetic material acquired through such programs , " the letter said			0
@entity1 spokesman @entity69 told @entity58 on monday that @entity9 established the policy " after carefully considering a variety of views , including those from outside the agency			0
he took seriously the concerns raised by the public health community , examined them closely , and took decisive action			2
" @entity69 also said it " is important to note that militant groups have a long history of attacking humanitarian aid workers in @entity20 and those attacks began years before the raid against the bin laden compound			0
" by publicizing the policy , he said the @entity1 hopes to " dispel one canard that militant groups have used as justification for cowardly attacks against vaccination providers , " noting that the agency " has great respect for the vital work that vaccination workers perform around the globe			0
" @entity96 spokeswoman @entity95 confirmed @entity54 's letter to the school deans and its contents .			0
