-- last week , i sat down with colleagues and students to an early @entity5 meal prepared by my university 's cafeteria			1
along with our winter greens , butternut squash , brussels sprouts with apples and bacon , and pumpkin grits , we ate a roasted " heritage breed turkey			1
" accolades ensued : " to me , all turkeys taste the same — except for this one — i can tell the difference , " said @entity19 who works in the medical school			0
the local greens from @entity24 farms were " really , really tasty , " said a first - year student from the @entity27 area and her friend from @entity29 , @entity30			2
the meal was @entity33 's fourth @entity32			0
the turkey that had everybody talking was a @entity36 , a heritage breed native to @entity38			1
along with @entity40 , @entity39 have been saved from extinction by farms like the @entity43 in @entity44 , where @entity33 's turkey 's come from , and by the efforts of the @entity47 , a nonprofit dedicated to conserving rare breeds of livestock			2
the @entity32 is not only an occasion for thanks and a good meal , but it also is part of a commitment to building a more sustainable food system			1
to preserve variety , we need to grow it and want to eat it ! @entity5 advice , recipes , solidarity and sanity genetic variety in our food system is the result of thousands of years of farmer and consumer choices , in itself a precious human heritage			1
adapted to local climates and all kinds of diseases and pests , the seeds and breeds that have survived until the present day are often hardier , more resilient — and can be more nutritious as well			0
as our planet warms and growing seasons shift , new patterns of flood , drought , frost and pests will stress our food system			1
when farmers plant large tracts of one variety -- perhaps one that is bred to grow faster , is suited to mechanical harvest and travels well -- or consumers demand only one breed of animal , our food supply is vulnerable			1
in the 1970s , for example , a disease wiped out more than 50 % of the corn crop in some states , because those areas were planted to one single corn variety			0
crop uniformity is the enemy of resilience			0
the hardy traits of older , heirloom varieties provide a safety valve			1
they allow us to breed new , more resilient crops using traits we do n't even know we need until disaster strikes			2
but can we count on those genetic riches surviving today ? around the world , the loss of species to extinction is progressing faster than ever			0
and this loss includes our seed varieties			0
studies using @entity120 crop lists from 1903 estimate that only 6 - 7 % of the nation 's named commercial varieties remained available by the 1980s			0
we lost , for example , 86 % of our apple varieties and 92 % of our lima beans			1
@entity127 and @entity128 in " @entity129 : food , politics , and the loss of @entity138 " report that 93 % of our lettuce varieties , 81 % of our tomatoes , 93 % of our carrots and 91 % of watermelon varieties are extinct			1
to be sure , commercial seed catalogs now list many new hybrid crop varieties			0
but these hybrid seeds do not contain the range of genetic variability of the older , open - pollinated seeds ( that is , plants pollinated by birds , insects or wind that " breed true " ) that reflect centuries of selection			0
this is a staggering loss of our precious genetic heritage			0
the best guarantee of a safe food supply as we head toward an uncertain global future is a large number of diverse food producers growing a wide variety of healthy seeds and breeds			1
but to save this rich biodiversity — of potatoes or turkeys — there needs to be a market			0
fortunately , there is a growing awareness of the importance of heirloom varieties , and local farmers markets and even some grocery stores feature multiple varieties			2
savoring distinct flavors in special types of vegetables , fruits and meats encourages us to recognize , enjoy and support farmers who are preserving variety			0
@entity181 : who 's at your @entity5 table ? that 's why @entity186 and her husband , @entity187 , ( who came from the chemistry department to our early @entity5 dinner ) grow a garden with heirloom vegetable varieties			1
and they order a heritage breed turkey for @entity5 even though it costs more			1
they are willing to spend extra money because , says @entity186 , " it 's tastier , and we 'd rather eat meat less often and not get mass - produced and flavorless turkey			0
" so , as you plan your feasts this holiday season , can you add an heirloom vegetable ? try a local specialty ? seek out a heritage breed ? our food future may depend on it			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .			2

@entity212 : early @entity5 dinner drew raves for tasty heritage turkey served
she says a sustainable food system needs diversity , preservation of old varieties
she says new *weather* patterns will stress crops ; old varieties provide growing options
@entity210 : *majority* of food plant varieties are lost ; help save the rest by providing demand
