-- @entity1 just wanted to make an animated film from a short story he loved			0
searching for funds to make his film a reality , @entity1 turned to @entity7 , an online fundraising site for creative projects			1
his goal ? to raise $ 150,000 to bankroll a @entity10 - style short of author @entity12 's " the @entity11 , " one of a growing number of six - figure projects on the 1Â½ - year - old site			1
" i was trying to find a way to fund it and was n't finding success anywhere because it did n't fit the model -- especially here in @entity20 where the short film is viewed as a novelty , " @entity1 said monday			0
" [ @entity7 ] was perfect , because if the fans want it , they 'll say something			1
and , boy , have they ever			0
" as of monday afternoon , the @entity7 project to fund @entity1 's short film had raised about $ 124,000 -- some of it donated by fans of @entity12 , the internationally celebrated author of " coraline " and other works			1
@entity1 needs another $ 26,000 by wednesday , the project 's deadline , for it to become a reality			1
@entity1 's is one of two projects active on @entity7 that are poised to land in the site 's all - time top 5 in terms of funds raised			1
the other seeks start - up funds for a device that converts an @entity47 into a wristwatch			1
it set out to raise $ 15,000 and now has hit a record $ 446,000 with more than two weeks to go			1
contributions to that project of at least $ 25 act as pre-orders for the @entity55 and @entity56 multi-touch watch kits			1
since @entity7 's launch in april 2009 , more than 300,000 people have pledged more than $ 25 million toward what the site calls " creative ideas and ambitious endeavors , " co-founder @entity57 said			1
during that time , each month 's total has been bigger than the one before			2
need a sign of the growth ? nine out of the site 's 10 largest - grossing projects have closed in the past two months			1
it 's not a charity site or a way for small businesses to sell their wares			2
the projects that have been bankrolled include films , books , video games and technology start - ups			2
" it 's really exciting seeing that increasing diversity , " @entity57 said			2
" it 's something we 're really proud of and have always hoped for , but you can hope and you never know how it 's going to turn out			0
" @entity7 , which uses the @entity86 , makes a profit by taking a small percentage of the funds donated to each project			2
it uses an all - or - nothing funding system			0
donors who pledge do n't pay up until the project reaches its funding goal			0
if it falls short , they are n't charged			0
virtually all projects offer rewards to donors			0
on @entity1 's project , a $ 25 pledge gets a digital download of the film , $ 50 gets a dvd and , at the top end , a $ 5,000 pledge [ there have been six so far ] earns an associate producer credit , vip seating with @entity12 and @entity1 at a screening of the movie and other rewards			1
until recently , the most high - profile project on @entity7 was @entity113 , a social - networking site that creators said would emphasize privacy in ways that @entity118 does n't			1
creators set out to raise $ 10,000 and in june ended up with $ 200,000 , promising donors access to the service 's private alpha launch , which went live just more than a week ago			2
@entity12 , whose honors include the @entity124 for children 's writing , the @entity127 for science - fiction and fantasy and a @entity130 in literature , has written fantasy epics " @entity133 " and " @entity134 " and the groundbreaking graphic - novel series " @entity137 , " among other works			1
last year 's feature - film adaptation of " coraline " was nominated for an @entity140			0
he 's an active blogger and one of the most popular users of @entity144 , with more than 1.5 million followers			0
he has used both to promote the fund drive			0
" i think that the best thing about @entity7 is it takes the ability to decide what you see , what happens , from the privileged few to the crowd , " @entity12 said monday via e-mail			1
" i ca n't wait until the first $ 50 million movie is funded through @entity7			1
" for an author , it 's fun			2
instead of selling the rights to my story , to actually kick in a few hundred dollars -- but i do n't think i could do that if i did n't trust @entity1 to make a great little film			0
" that project has a lot of people rooting for it , " @entity57 said			0
" @entity12 is really incredible in how connected he is to his fans and the rest of the web community			2
" he could get money from anybody to do anything ... but he obviously sees something in engaging the audience in a different way , letting them really feel that ownership			0
" for @entity1 , the next two days will be a pressure cooker , he said , as he sweats out the project 's final hours			2
he said a pitch to get donors to increase their pledges ( in exchange for a poster ) has gotten more than 100 takers			0
he 's also hoping for a last - minute push from @entity12 and other backers			1
but he said he 's already been deeply affected by the @entity7 community			1
@entity1 mentions a man -- a complete stranger -- who contacted him to say that he 's homeless , but mowed lawns to raise money to give to the project because it means that much to him			0
" i ca n't even explain or put words to it -- the unbelievable good will from all these people , " he said			0
" so many stories you read are so horrible and so depressing you want to crawl under a rock			0
