-- @entity2 's death , coming so soon after he announced he was curtailing his movie - reviewing schedule because of recurring cancer , is being greetedâ € ” especially across the @entity7 -- with widespread shock , and the kind of grief one feels when one loses a longtime neighbor , a trusted friend , a beloved teacher whose lessons may not have had an immediate impact but became more meaningful with time			1
who could have imagined the @entity16 people would ever feel that way about a critic , any critic ? few could have as far back as 1975 when @entity2 , the prize - winning film reviewer for the @entity21 , first teamed up with his @entity23 competitor @entity22 for a locally broadcast weekly series , " coming to a theater near you			1
" over the next 24 years , their weekly half - hour of movie clips and clipped arguments became an ever - expanding nationwide franchise			0
it catapulted both men to fame and riches befitting media icons -- and altered preconceived notions of what a critic looked and sounded like			0
opinion : @entity2 's sheer love of life in fact , it 's only natural the blogosphere should feel the pain of @entity2 's leaving			1
one could say that blogs of all shapes , sizes and subjects owe their existence in part to the examples set by @entity22 and @entity2			1
long before @entity22 and @entity2 helped embed the " thumbs up / thumbs down " judgment meme in television folklore , critics were viewed in the popular imagination as fastidious bullies , often packing @entity63 accents and high - end vocabularies , with nothing but bad will to deliver to anything they saw or heard			1
the type was best embodied in past epochs by the performances of @entity72 or @entity73 , who portrayed acid - tongued theater critics in , respectively , " @entity75 " ( 1950 ) and " @entity76 " ( 1944 )			0
@entity22 and @entity2 knew about those movies , but they knew many more things those mythical assailants of reputation could not			1
the broad perspective they brought to movies also widened the public 's view of critics			2
they were bright @entity89 guys who were , yes , erudite enough to know their @entity63 classics as well as the comparative merits of animated @entity93 musicals			0
they also were capable of squirting venom on things they did n't like with conspicuous panache			0
but their warm manner , open - ended aesthetics and companionable personalities helped viewers understand that criticism was n't always about being , well , critical			0
it was a way of seeing the world , of thinking your way through something you otherwise took for granted			0
their approach made criticism not only less threatening and formidable , but it also made critical thinking seem accessible , even , well , friendly			1
@entity111 : favorite @entity2 quotes @entity22 accurately rated @entity2 the better prose stylist of the pair			1
certainly , he was the more celebrated writer , having been the first movie reviewer to win a @entity115 for criticism , in 1975			0
as idiosyncratic as his style could be ( rakish and puckish when he felt mischievous ; oracular and didactic when he felt messianic ) , he was never conspicuously out for blood the way @entity120 , the serpentine , post-millennial , popular prototype of a critic , often seemed to be when assessing talent on tv			0
his annual movie yearbooks exhibited his witty , humane approach to reviewing and to celebrity interviews , which somehow retained his personal touch even in later years as publicists tightened their control over one - on - one access to actors and directors			0
he was never shy about showing off his knowledge of movie history , but he also never made it seem like a closed shop , open only to a favored few			0
he wanted more readers to like better movies			0
and he carried out his mission through a website that became as much a trendsetter for other internet venues as the @entity22 - and - @entity2 model became for point - counterpoint tv panel shows			1
one sensed @entity2 's enjoyment at being a role model for movie geeks who wanted to get their own aesthetic values aired on the @entity152			1
as with his late partner , @entity2 worked at putting on no airs			2
he seemed less like a snooty aesthete than a regular guy who just happened to know a little more about movies than anyone else in the neighborhood and set up a little corner stand to talk about them			0
if , as is often remarked , everybody 's a critic , then @entity2 was one of the crucial forces responsible for empowering everybody to believe they 're critics			1
remembering @entity2 this may annoy those who remain averse to the idea of criticism itself			2
but @entity2 , who also used his blog for occasional political or social commentary , would probably reply by saying that , if anything , there are n't enough people engaging in critical thinking when it comes to matters affecting their own lives			2
and by " critical , " i doubt very much that @entity2 would have meant a position of carping or complaining or even cutting - down - to - size so much as a state of heightened perception , of being open enough to the possibility that whatever you 're looking at or listening to may not be what it seems -- or should be			2
as the lights went down one last time , @entity2 would have loved it if all those people sitting in the dark and hoping for the best understood that his approach to movies was big enough , openhearted enough to embrace far more than the movies he 'd loved all his life			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			2
