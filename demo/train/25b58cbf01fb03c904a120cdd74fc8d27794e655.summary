-- with extreme heat and the worst drought in half a century continuing to plague the farm states , there are important lessons to be learned for all of us -- farmers , consumers and the world 's poorest populations alike -- about the effect of climate change			1
the @entity13 announced this season 's first major crop yield forecasts , and they were n't pretty : a nationwide average of 123.4 bushels of corn per acre , the lowest level since 1995			1
soybean yield is expected to be low too , though not as bad as corn			0
the @entity20 , which is the world 's largest producer and exporter of staple grains , is grappling with the biggest surprise in production shortfalls since the @entity27 of the 1930s			1
certainly , this july surpassed july 1936 as the hottest month on record			0
so , how will the devastation affect @entity20 crop farmers ? drought , heat bring spiders out since mid-june , corn prices have risen about 60 % , more than twice the projected decline in yield			1
this means that farm revenue will go up			0
about 90 % of the corn acreage is backed by a generously subsidized federal insurance program , described by @entity42 as " @entity43 for the corn , " so crop farmers will be just fine			1
livestock farmers who use corn to feed their animals could see higher costs , but most have contracts with processors who provide their feed grains			2
what about consumers ? will high commodity prices affect the prices of food you eat ? not much , actually			1
commodity prices account for just a tiny share of retail food prices			1
if you 're a shrewd shopper , next year you may notice higher prices for meat , milk , eggs , and cheese and all types of processed foods			2
the @entity13 estimates that food prices will increase 3 to 4 % in 2013			1
this is not going to radically change your life			0
people in rich countries like the @entity20 are not going to eat much less or much differently as a result of modestly higher prices			1
the crop losses will have the most effect on the world 's poorest populations			1
about 2 billion people still live on $ 2 a day or less			0
many of them live in urban areas of developing countries			0
often , they must spend half or more of their income on food , the bulk coming from staple grains like corn , wheat and rice			0
for these people , a huge rise in grain prices is more than noticeable -- it can literally break their budget			0
in 2008 and 2011 , when corn prices went up to levels nearly as high as today 's , the world saw a sharp rise in food riots			1
many pointed to wheat prices as a catalyst for revolutions in the @entity108 , including @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111			0
it is not hard to see that food - related security problems overseas could cost us far more than the extra pennies we 'll pay at the grocery store			0
@entity118 scientist links climate change , extreme weather the @entity20 can ease price pains somewhat by suspending government rules that mandate biofuel production			1
in 2011 , about 40 % of @entity20 corn crops were diverted to ethanol ( a quarter , if we take into account that nutritional content is recycled back into feeds for animals in the form of distiller grains )			1
but this seems untenable politically			0
the larger and more important issue is whether this year 's bad crop yield is an omen of what we should expect going forward			2
record high temperatures are occurring with far greater frequency than in decades past , and crop yields decline sharply in extreme heat			1
in research that @entity142 and i have conducted using the @entity145 climate model , we project yield declines of about 20 % over the next 20 years , holding all else the same			2
this summer 's extreme heat may just become typical in 15 years			1
some have criticized these projections as too pessimistic , and they just might be			0
an atmosphere richer in carbon dioxide concentrations may allow plants to transpire less water during photosynthesis , and thus , improve drought tolerance			0
farmers can adjust to earlier planting times , perhaps avoiding some extreme temperatures during the sensitive flowering period , and lengthening the growing season			2
and new drought - tolerant crop varieties have been developed			2
this season was a good test of these adaptive strategies			0
it appears they did n't work			0
carbon dioxide concentrations are much higher than they were in 1983 and 1988 , when it was nearly as hot as this summer			0
and farmers planted much earlier than usual , many using new drought - tolerant varieties			2
record drought is good business for some for now , we can take a little comfort that ample harvests in the @entity177 , @entity178 and parts of the @entity180 could make up for some of the decimated crops in the central @entity183 this year			0
but next year ? and the years after ? in the long term , a warming world will be a difficult challenge for our crops and all of us			2
complete coverage : drought the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			1

@entity192 : extreme heat and drought are signs of a changing climate
@entity192 : farmers and @entity20 consumers will be fine ; food prices will go up a bit in 2013
he says the crop losses will have the most effect on the world 's poorest populations
@entity192 : this summer 's extreme heat may just become typical in 15 years
