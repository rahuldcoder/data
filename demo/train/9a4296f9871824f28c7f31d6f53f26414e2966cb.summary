-- maybe we 've seen " the @entity2 " too many times			0
but we could n't help breaking into an enthusiastic rendition of " @entity4 " when we came across these @entity7 - themed @entity6 photos by 36 - year - old photographer @entity8			1
made by combining @entity6 minifigures , props and images , @entity8 's " @entity10 " series captures the spirit of @entity7 in toy form , whether it 's @entity17 - toting shoppers , a @entity19 lion dance or punters checking out the betting prospects at the horse track			1
some come with a side of social commentary that perhaps only a local would recognize , such as " @entity26 " or " @entity27 , " both featured in the above gallery			2
inspired by the streets @entity8 , a freelance photographer with a full - time gig in property management , says inspiration usually strikes when he 's out shooting photos of daily life in @entity7			1
" during the shoot , whenever i capture something interesting i think , ' would it work with @entity6 ? ' if that 's a yes , i 'll just do it			2
" turns out , @entity8 was n't even a big @entity6 fan when he started out			1
" it was during an annual cleanup that my girlfriend , now wife , found an old box of @entity6 , " says @entity8 , who produced his first @entity6 - based photograph in 2010			1
" i had never played with @entity6 bricks before and found it interesting			0
i held a tiny figure and thought , if i could use this in my photography it would be interesting as well			0
that 's where the concept came from			2
" since then , it 's evolved to focus on people , incidents and things with a unique @entity7 flair			1
" four years on , he 's created 30 - some @entity60 images			1
if you 're thinking about befriending @entity8 in the hopes of getting invited over to play with his massive @entity6 stash , bad news			1
your kids likely have a more impressive collection than he does			0
" i probably only have five or six boxes of @entity6			0
but because of @entity10 , i 've quite a library of figures -- about 80 of them			1
" creating awesomeness is n't easy @entity8 says getting the background of his photos to look realistic takes time and experience			1
" the ones that are taken in an actual outdoor scene with @entity6 figures -- it takes about a week to plan , prepare and buy props , " he says			2
" the second type are taken at home with a background image taken by me			0
" the production process includes taking photos from the actual location , buying the props and setting up the shooting scene at home			1
" as it is more complicated , it usually takes about two weeks			0
" for example , his " @entity91 " image features a @entity6 van that he 's covered in signs and menus from a photo of an actual @entity98 truck			2
the photo is sure to hit locals with a vanilla - flavored cone of nostalgia , as these once popular moving ice cream purveyors have been around since the 1970s			0
his " @entity27 " image , a recreation of the annual commemoration of those killed in @entity108 , was his most challenging work to date			0
" it took me three weeks , " he says			0
" i wanted to create the special candle vigil effects , so i bought some tiny led light bulbs and parts			0
then , i studied how to light them up from the @entity115			0
" it was also a lot of work to set up the scene as i had to find ways to hide the wires			0
" " we had a crowd around his photos all weekend " @entity8 's @entity10 photos are currently on display at the city 's @entity127 gallery			1
founder @entity129 says it was an easy decision to exhibit the pics , as the venue seeks to promote young @entity7 photographers who may otherwise struggle to find outlets for their work			2
" we feel that @entity8 is very clever and insightful and captures in a very unusual and creative way the essential spirit of @entity7 , " says @entity129			1
" he is of that 1980s generation who are concerned about the direction @entity7 is taking and often feel unable to make their voices heard properly			2
" @entity8 's photography and @entity10 is his very creative outlet to show his views			1
" the response to @entity10 has been huge , he adds			2
" at the recent @entity147 , held last month , we had a crowd around his photos all weekend and sold them extremely successfully			2
we were pleased that the buyer profile was so broad , from kids to retirees and of all nationalities			0
" @entity129 says the gallery does n't limit how long a photographer 's work is on display so there are no plans to remove @entity8 's exhibition any time soon , though it 's a popular series and prints are selling fast			1
" they are limited editions and we anticipate that some of them will sell out quite quickly			0
one image has already sold over 20 pieces from an edition of 30			0
