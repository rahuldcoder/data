-- @entity3 ' former coach @entity2 has revealed his fears for the former world no. 1 's future , after injury forced the @entity7 out of the opening round of the @entity9 at @entity10 on thursday			1
@entity2 believes a huge question mark now looms over @entity3 ' career after the 14 - time major winner forfeited his round after playing just nine holes in a six - over - par total of 42 , which included a triple - bogey at the par - four fourth			1
" i think his whole future is up in the air , " @entity2 told reporters			2
" does it mean he needs more surgery ? if he does who knows what is going to happen			0
" speaking to reporters after pulling out , @entity3 added : " i felt good this morning and fine during warm - up and then as i played , it got progressively worse			0
the knee acted up then the @entity30 followed after that , then the calf started cramping up			0
" the 35 - year - old 's career has been marred by four knee operations and the @entity9 was his first tournament since injuring his knee and achilles heel during a difficult stroke on the 14th in the third round of @entity40 in april			1
woods was then forced to withdraw from the @entity42 earlier in may and his latest injury has compounded worries for his career , which has not seen a victory in 18 months and a major title win in three years			1
@entity41 ' withdrawal mirrors his showing at last year 's @entity9 , where a neck injury brought an end to his bid on the seventh hole in the final round			1
he now has just over a month to get fit enough for the @entity58 , but medical experts are doubtful that he will be able to recuperate in time for the required practice rounds ahead of the championship tournament at @entity62 on june 16 - 19			2
meanwhile , @entity64 's @entity63 mastered tricky conditions to open up a three - shot lead at the halfway stage of the @entity68 in @entity69 on friday			0
the 23 - year - old carded a five - under - par 65 to move to eight - under - par after 36 holes -- ahead of compatriot @entity72 and @entity73 , who both hit level 70s			0
@entity63 is eyeing his maiden @entity76 victory after losing a playoff to @entity79 @entity58 champion @entity78 at the @entity80 in @entity81 in january			2
overnight leader @entity82 of @entity83 , who set a course record 63 on thursday , slumped to a seven - over - par 77 to leave him on level par 140 .			0
