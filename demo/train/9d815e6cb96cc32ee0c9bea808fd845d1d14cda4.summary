-- " what do you love ? what do you fear ? what 's in your pocket ? " these were among the questions asked of the world by director @entity9 when shooting " @entity13 , " the remarkable crowd - sourced film that debuted on @entity12 in 2011			1
produced by @entity15 blockbuster brothers @entity16 ( " alien , " " @entity18 " ) and @entity17 ( " @entity19 " ) , and edited from 81,000 submissions from 192 countries , " @entity13 " is a video mosaic of intimate moments from around the world all shot on one random day -- july 24 , 2010			0
the documentary has racked up nearly 7.8 million views on @entity12 to date			0
now , another pair of director brothers is taking on a similarly inspired project -- this time commissioned by the city of @entity32			1
" @entity34 " director @entity33 and his younger brother @entity35 are taking on a crowd - sourced video ode to @entity38 's capital			1
titled " @entity32 , @entity39 , " the project works like this : would - be participants choose one of three themes -- working in @entity32 , made in @entity32 and @entity32 -- and upload a video of less than five minutes on the project 's channel from now until november 9			1
the brothers ' joint production company will choose clips and edit them into a film with a cohesive narrative			0
participants have a chance to win plane tickets to @entity32 , cars and laptops			1
a dark past despite being the most celebrated director from the country , @entity33 may be considered an odd choice for an ambitious global marketing effort for @entity32 tourism			1
@entity69 's startlingly violent " @entity68 , " which includes " @entity34 " and " @entity70 , " amassed a fanatic following around the world for its unflinching and at times disturbing treatment of fear and pain			2
his first @entity15 movie , " @entity74 " ( 2013 ) , starring @entity72 and @entity73 , is a sinister psychological thriller			2
when he 's not exploring violence or @entity79 chills , it 's vampire horror			0
despite the aura of darkness in his work , @entity69 says he 's actually an apt choice for delivering a message of hope			1
so do the project 's backers			0
" we had other directors in our mind , but we decided to go with director park and his brother , as we thought they would manage this project with creativity and global recognition and provide opportunity for global citizens to participate , " says @entity88 , director for the tourism business division for the @entity90			1
@entity69 also had the benefit of discussing the project with @entity16 when the two were working together on " @entity74			0
" @entity16 produced , @entity69 directed			0
in an interview with @entity0 , the @entity69 brothers discussed " @entity32 , @entity39			2
" @entity0 : fans expect dark movies from you			2
what kind of story are you planning to tell through " @entity32 , @entity39 ? " @entity33 : i 'm sure many do n't know this , but i 've actually directed a hopeful and bright movie called , " i 'm a @entity115 , but that 's ok			1
" i think it 's a common bias from the public that i only create and film the darker movies with serious story lines			0
similar to my previous film works , i want to deliver the message of " hope " through " @entity32 , @entity39			1
" now , when i say " hope , " i 'm not referring to the floating bubbles of " hope " with unrealistic wishes and dreams that pop as soon as you blow them			0
i 'm actually referring to the solid , powerful " hopes " facing reality in this world			0
in this film , i want to portray a lot of scenes that feature ordinary people in the labor force			0
it 's a movie that will be created by participants			2
though this is what i want , i 'm sure the movie itself will vary in its atmosphere or story line depending on the type of films or videos that are shared with us			2
@entity0 : who will weed out submissions ? @entity35 - kyong : videos on the official @entity12 channel will be constantly viewed by @entity154 ( the @entity69 brothers ' production company )			1
different videos posted by various @entity32 locals and travelers will keep us ( engaged ) during the editing process			1
@entity0 : what are your favorite places in @entity32 ? @entity33 : @entity164 and @entity165 , also known as @entity166 , in @entity167 are some of my favorite places in @entity32			1
there are many fancy roads with quiet residential areas and countless small streets on the steepest hills			0
also , dainty restaurants and @entity176 , a place that symbolizes the old and contemporary @entity179 art , are all located there			0
an area like @entity166 is one of the most " free " places in @entity32 with its dynamic vibrant actions from various residents -- ethnic minority groups , homosexual communities , etc. @entity35 - kyong : i was born in @entity32 and have lived in this city for over 40 years			1
despite this , @entity32 is so dynamic that i still have n't been to many places around the city			2
but if i have to pick , a few of my favorite spots would definitely be @entity195 3 - ga and 5 - ga , a trail in @entity197 where i can see the city 's skyline , and @entity200 , @entity201 and @entity203 's @entity202 .			0
