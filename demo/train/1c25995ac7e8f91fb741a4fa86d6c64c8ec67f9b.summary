-- does your company have in place what amounts to an " @entity7 - only " policy for employees ? yes ? no ? how do we get @entity9 to tell the whole truth ? at the very least , what we have at the trendy organic supermarket chain is a failure to communicate -- in any language			1
@entity15 and @entity16 -- two employees of a @entity9 in @entity18 , @entity19 -- say that they were suspended for speaking @entity20 on the job and complaining to a manager who told them , in a staff meeting , that a company policy required them to speak @entity7			1
who would have thought ? @entity28 make up a staggering 46.7 % of @entity19 's population , and many of those folks have roots that run deep in the @entity19			1
new @entity33 do not play games when it comes to preserving language and culture			0
they take their right to speak @entity20 seriously			1
@entity19 's state constitution does not declare an official language , and it protects @entity20 and @entity43 languages			1
so you ca n't have @entity7 - only policies there			1
but not everyone sees eye to eye			0
remember that flap in october 2009 when @entity49 -- an innkeeper in @entity50 , @entity19 -- got in hot " agua " after firing some of his employees for speaking @entity20 and refusing to anglicize their names			1
you know , " @entity57 " to " @entity55 , " " @entity58 " to " @entity59 " etc. @entity49 , a @entity61 transplant , claimed he was only thinking about his customer			0
but a lot of @entity33 thought he was n't thinking at all			0
now , @entity15 and @entity16 got in trouble			0
granted , their suspension at @entity9 only lasted a day , and it was with pay			1
so the individual employees did n't suffer much harm			0
but there are those who believe that the cultural traditions of the state of @entity19 took a slap in the face			1
this is n't the end of this			0
how did the company respond ? take your pick			0
at first , @entity9 spokeswoman @entity83 told the @entity84 that the employees misunderstood the reason they were disciplined and that they were actually suspended for being " rude and disrespectful			1
" in the context of employees talking to their boss , it 's pretty clear that what she really meant to say was that they were " insubordinate			2
" @entity83 also told @entity84 that the employees were never told they could n't speak @entity20 , and that there is no policy in place at the company that prohibits people from speaking a foreign language			1
but the issue is not whether the company prohibits the speaking of a foreign language , but whether it requires the speaking of @entity7			1
maybe it 's just semantics , or maybe it 's more than semantics			0
besides , it does n't look like @entity110 -- who is based in @entity112 -- was up to speed on what was happening on the ground in @entity18			0
@entity115 , executive marketing coordinator for @entity116 , issued a statement acknowledging that the company believes that " having a uniform form of communication is essential to a safe and efficient working environment			0
" therefore , the statement said , " our policy states that all @entity7 speaking @entity124 must speak @entity7 to customers and other @entity126 while on the clock			1
" " must speak , " eh ? sounds like an @entity7 - only policy to me			1
it went on : " @entity126 are free to speak any language they would like during their breaks , meal periods and before and after work			0
@entity9 gives you permission to speak @entity20 with family members at home before leaving for work			1
that 's big of them			0
and what if a @entity20 - speaking customer wants to come in and pay too much for an organic apple ? they thought of that , too			1
the statement continues : " additionally , this policy does not apply to conversations among @entity124 and customers if all parties present agree that a different language is their preferred form of communication			2
" then , of course , there was the pr sprinkled with @entity159			0
" at @entity9 , we take pride in the diversity of our @entity126 member and customer base			2
we recognize with this diversity comes the challenge of different languages spoken			0
" see , there 's the problem right there			0
the fact that an employee speaks more than one language is n't a challenge to be overcome			0
it 's a valuable asset that provides one 's company with limitless opportunities			2
and , after all that effort and all those words , the folks responsible for communicating for @entity9 still were n't sure they were communicating well enough			2
so @entity83 circled back around and tried to edit @entity115 's statement , telling @entity183 in an e-mail that saying employees " must speak @entity7 " was " an overstatement			1
" the final word is that the company now says that it would review the policy			2
you know , the one that it supposedly did n't have 10 minutes ago			0
and these are the folks who want us all to speak proper @entity7 so we can get our point across ? they need to go first			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			2

two @entity9 workers in @entity19 say they spoke @entity20 , got suspended
@entity197 : does the company have some sort of " @entity7 - only " policy ?
he says @entity19 's state constitution actually does not declare an official language
@entity197 : @entity9 need to be *smarter* about its language policy for employees
