@entity0 , a 28 - year - old marketing officer in @entity1 , makes a six - hour trip to @entity3 in eastern @entity4 to see her parents twice a year -- once during the @entity6 and again during the @entity8 holiday in october			1
" i feel like i should visit my parents more but having a job in the financial industry means i have to work long hours and sacrifice some of my personal time for work , " @entity9 , an only child , tells @entity10			1
@entity9 's dilemma is faced by many young people in @entity4 , where a one - child policy and three decades of economic reforms have accelerated the decline of the traditional extended family			1
it 's also a matter of concern for @entity4 's new leaders as they grapple with the burden of supporting the growing number of elderly people			1
new law a new national law introduced this week requires the offspring of parents older than 60 to visit their parents " frequently " and make sure their financial and spiritual needs are met			1
" people are accusing young people of not visiting their parents enough , " says @entity9 , adding she agrees with the aims of the law			2
" admittedly , some of them use their career and long working hours as an excuse			0
my problems are that i do care about my parents , but i have little vacation and my parents live far away			2
" according to the state - run @entity49 news agency , @entity4 had about 185 million people above the age of 60 at the end of 2011			1
the figure is expected to surge to 221 million in 2015 and by 2050 a third of @entity4 's population will be classed as elderly			1
neglect the " @entity63 " was amended by @entity4 's legislature in december after a spate of reports about elderly parents neglected by their children			1
in one particularly horrific case in @entity4 's eastern @entity67 province , a local television station reported that a farmer had kept his 100 - year - old mother in a pigsty with a 440lb sow			1
@entity72 told the station his mother had been happy to live there : " she wants to stay here because she feels it is convenient , " he said			0
a modest pension and social welfare system , particularly in rural areas , means elderly people are usually dependent on their children for support			2
more than a fifth live below the poverty line , according to figures from the @entity87 at @entity88			0
changing values although respect for the elderly is still deeply engrained in @entity4 society , traditional values like filial piety have been weakened by the country 's rush to modernity			1
" the traditional family support system is eroding for many reasons and i think the government would like to slow this process down , " said @entity98 , the director of the @entity99 at the @entity100			0
the law stipulates that children can not give up their inheritance rights in attempt to evade their duty to take care of their parents			1
it adds that children should pay a monthly allowance to their parents if they refuse to take care of them			2
the legislation also allows for the elderly to sue their children but does not specify the process or what penalties they might face			2
it may also prove difficult to enforce , says @entity120 from @entity121			0
he told the @entity123 newspaper the law fails to qualify the word " frequently			0
" he added that few elderly people were likely to sue their own children			2
first case on tuesday , @entity49 reported that a 77 - year - old woman from @entity67 city of @entity131 sued her daughter for neglecting her			0
in the first case after the new law came into effect , the local court ruled that her daughter must visit her at least twice a month and provide financial support			0
but the law 's introduction has proved controversial			2
some say it puts too much pressure on those who move away from home for work , study or other opportunities			0
@entity146 , 50 , whose only child is studying for a master 's degree in the @entity150 , said the law " distorts the parent - child relationship			1
" he hopes his daughter will head to a big city like @entity1 or @entity155 to find a job on graduation and not return to the small town where she grew up			0
" i do n't want my daughter to have a burden both physically and spiritually , " he told @entity10			0
" for me , my daughter 's career is the most important thing			0
as the parent of an only child , i have spent so much time and money on my daughter 's education and now i want her to be successful			0

new @entity4 law requires children to visit elderly parents
care of growing elderly population a big *challenge* for @entity4 's leaders
one - child policy and economic reform have broken up extended family
some say law controversial and hard to enforce
