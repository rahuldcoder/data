-- when @entity2 speaks about driver safety in @entity4 , it 's worth listening			1
the racing legend was a pioneer in raising standards in an era when mortality rates were high , and his legacy has left @entity4 stars with greater support than ever before			1
but he is still worried about one burning issue -- the controversy over sole supplier @entity17 's tires , which he says are dangerous due to their rapid rate of degradation			1
the three - time world champion told @entity0 that drivers risked a " multiple - car accident " unless immediate improvements are made			1
" i do n't think that amount of rubber should be coming off the tires and be left to the side of the track , " the 72 - year - old said			1
" if you go over that rubber it then sticks to the terribly hot -- above @entity36 ( @entity37 ) -- tires			2
" when you get to the next corner your car is now totally unstable , and when you 're going to brake you 'll probably lose control of your car			0
if there 's a car close to you then that will cause a multiple - car accident -- it has to be improved			1
" the @entity49 , who notched up 27 wins in an @entity4 career spanning eight years , also blamed the tires for the exceptionally open season			1
four different drivers have won each of the four races so far , ahead of the start of the @entity60 swing in @entity61 this weekend			0
" an issue that nobody can quite work out is how the tire wheel , tire temperatures work , " @entity2 said			2
" we 've seen a lot of winning and losing because of when people have chosen or not chosen to go into the pits			0
" the " @entity2 " -- as he was nicknamed during his racing days -- agreed with @entity72 driver @entity71 's criticisms of the @entity74 tire manufacturer			2
seven - time world champion @entity71 has complained about the quicker degradation of the tires and even likened them to driving on " on raw eggs			1
" @entity81 team boss @entity80 , whose drivers @entity82 and @entity84 struggled with their tires at the @entity86 , has also criticized @entity17			1
meanwhile @entity71 's teammate @entity87 , who won the @entity88 @entity86 last month , argued the unpredictability made racing interesting			2
@entity17 has argued it should be congratulated for such an open , unpredictable season			0
the manufacturer claimed it was simply responding to calls for more eventful racing , with director @entity94 saying : " we are pushing the limits			0
" @entity2 , who won the @entity61 @entity86 three times , said the high caliber of this season 's drivers made it anyone 's championship			1
" they 're probably the best bunch of drivers i 've seen since the late ' 60s , early ' 70s when we had around eight or nine drivers capable of winning			0
" he said @entity87 's win in @entity88 could finally spell a comeback for @entity72			0
it was the @entity112 marque 's first race win since @entity113 in @entity74 in 1955			0
this week the team played down reports it could be set to quit @entity4			0
@entity118 newspaper @entity116 claimed @entity118 - based @entity72 could be forced out over a power dispute arising from @entity4 's proposed stock exchange flotation			1
a @entity72 spokesman said only that they were " in discussions with the commercial rights holder			0
" but @entity2 believes this could be @entity72 ' season , saying they were " giants			0
" " the @entity125 has been winning races since the ' 20s and ' 30s and came back in the ' 50s and won races , " he said			0
" if they had n't won that race ( in @entity88 ) and showed themselves to be that competitive in the ones immediately following it , i think there might have been a chance of @entity136 withdrawing from @entity4			2
