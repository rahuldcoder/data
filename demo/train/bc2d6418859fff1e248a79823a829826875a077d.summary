editor 's note : this is part one of a two - part series			0
@entity4 was based at @entity5 in 1966 and 1967			2
he was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1998			1
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- the sick men are @entity11 , or sons of @entity11			1
all 20 of them were based at or lived at @entity5 , the @entity11 ' training base in @entity15 , between the 1960s and the 1980s			1
they all have had breast cancer , a disease that strikes fewer than 2,000 men in the @entity21 a year , compared with about 200,000 women			1
each has had part of his chest removed as part of his treatment , along with chemotherapy , radiation or both			0
and they blame their time at @entity5 , where government records show drinking water was contaminated with high levels of toxic chemicals for three decades , for their illnesses			1
" we come from all walks of life , " said @entity38 , the son and grandson of @entity11 , who was born on the base 40 years ago			2
" and some of us have college degrees , some of us have blue - collar jobs			0
we are all over the country			0
and what is our commonality ? our commonality is that we all at some point in our lives drank the water at @entity5			1
" starting in 1980 , tests showed drinking water at @entity5 had been " highly contaminated " with solvents			1
several wells that supplied water to the base were found to have been contaminated in 1984 and 1985 , and were promptly taken out of service after the pollutants were found , the @entity11 told @entity9			1
among the chemicals later identified in the drinking water were trichloroethylene , a degreaser ; benzene ; and the dry cleaning solvent perchloroethylene			2
two independent studies have found no link between water contamination and later illnesses , according to the @entity11			1
but the men facing a debilitating and possibly lethal disease do n't buy it			0
" that 's literally unheard of to have 20 men come from the same place , walking on the same dirt , drinking the same water , " said @entity4 , who was based at the camp in 1966 and 1967			2
" i mean , there has to be a link there somehow			0
and they 're saying that it could n't happen			0
" @entity4 , a @entity88 native who fought in @entity89 , was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1998			1
when it returned after surgery , spreading to his spine and back , he " kind of manned up to it after a while and expected to die			0
" " once you have metastasis in the bone , it 's basically just a matter of time before you die , you know , " he told @entity9			0
" luckily , i have already passed my due date by five years			0
i outlived that death sentence i got			0
" @entity4 is one of seven male breast cancer survivors who spent time at @entity5 who spoke to @entity9			1
@entity4 said that at the time of his diagnosis , he did n't know men could get breast cancer			1
@entity109 , who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008 , was based at @entity5 in 1981 and 1982			1
the cancer spread to his spine , ribs and hips			0
" the difference with metastatic breast cancer means now there 's no cure			1
so the average life expectancy is two to three years , " @entity118 told @entity9			0
" being a man , i try to take care of my wife and my daughter , " he said , his voice catching			0
" now that i 'm considered disabled because i can no longer work and use my arms , you 're having challenges			0
" dr. @entity129 , a breast cancer surgeon at the @entity131 in @entity7 , @entity8 , said he 's startled by the common threads among the group			1
" the average breast cancer patient for males is about 70 years old , " @entity129 said			1
" so when you have gentlemen in their 30s stepping forward , without a family history of breast cancer , that is alarming			1
and the question is , why ? why is this happening ? " as many as 500,000 people may have been exposed to the contaminated water over a period of 30 years , the @entity11 said			1
@entity145 , @entity4 , @entity118 and others @entity9 interviewed are all members of " @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , " which was set up to organize people who believe they have been affected by the contamination			0
but in a written response to questions raised by the men , the @entity11 told @entity9 that two studies have examined whether contaminated water led to illnesses among base personnel or their families			1
" to date , these studies have not identified a link between exposure to the historically impacted water at @entity5 and adverse health effects , " the service said			1
in addition , it said a 2004 review by the @entity11 found the service followed existing water quality regulations			1
and investigations by the @entity175 administration 's @entity173 and @entity176 found no criminal conduct by @entity11 officials and no violations of the @entity180			1
but @entity181 , an @entity176 investigator , told a @entity182 in 2007 that some employees interviewed during the criminal investigation appeared to have been coached and were not forthcoming with details			0
the @entity173 decided against filing charges based on his concern , however			0
parts of @entity5 have been included on the @entity176 's @entity191 list of contaminated sites			2
benzene , one of the chemicals found in the water there , is classified as a known human carcinogen by the federal government , while the other two are listed as potential causes of cancer			2
@entity202 , an epidemiologist with the federal @entity203 , said the level of contamination in one sample taken at @entity5 was " the highest i 've ever seen in a public water system in this country			2
" but , he added , " whether exposures were long enough and high enough at @entity5 to cause disease -- that 's the question			2
" researchers need to know more about where the men lived on the base , what kind of work they did , their medical histories and other details before reaching a conclusion , @entity202 said			0
" we 're not sure there 's one common cause across all these cases , " he said			0
" there may be several different causes			0
" the @entity227 said it has worked with environmental and health agencies " from the beginning " to determine whether the contamination resulted in any illness , and " this collaboration continues to the present day			0
" but so far , " collaboration " does not involve medical care for the stricken men , who say they are now facing a bureaucratic @entity235 : the @entity11 sends them to the @entity238 , which says it ca n't treat the men for a condition that has n't been shown to have been " service - related			2
" " how could they do this to me after i served the country faithfully ? " retired @entity11 @entity242 told @entity9			2
" how could they do this to my fellow @entity11 ? "			2

20 people , all @entity11 or sons of @entity11 , have had male breast cancer
each lived at @entity5 between the 1960s and 1980s
" we all at some point in our lives drank the water at @entity5 , " one says
@entity11 says two studies found no link to " adverse health effects "
