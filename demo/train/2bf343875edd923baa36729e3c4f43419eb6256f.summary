the budget proposal introduced by @entity1 on tuesday is much more than a series of numbers on a spreadsheet -- it 's a vision for reforming the key pillars of the @entity7 social contract in the 21st century			1
in that regard , it 's very different from the vision put forward by president @entity11 in his budget plan from a month ago , which emphasized preserving the status quo with another round of tax hikes			1
the central economic problem of coming years is how to update the nation 's largest entitlement programs so that they are sustainable and available to future generations of @entity7			1
the @entity20 projects that spending on @entity21 , @entity22 ( plus the new 2010 health care law ) will increase from about 10 % of the nation 's total economic output this year , as measured by gross domestic product ( gdp ) , to nearly 16 % in 2035			2
historically , the government has collected about 18 % of @entity27 in revenue			0
thus , if the entitlement programs remain on autopilot , there will either be nothing left in the budget beyond transfer payments , or government taxes will have to soar			2
in @entity22 , the @entity38 budget preserves today 's arrangements for those in or near retirement			1
but for future entrants into the program , @entity22 would change into a " premium support " model			0
the government would provide a fixed level of premium assistance to the program 's enrollees , and they would use that assistance to pick from among competing insurance options , including the traditional fee - for - service federal program			2
@entity22 's drug benefit is already run as a premium support program , and spending on the program over its first decade is now projected to be more than 40 % below what was expected at enactment in 2003			2
a recent analysis produced for the @entity61 , a conservative think tank , shows that a competitive bidding approach in the full @entity22 program would reduce costs by more than 5 % in year one alone			0
that 's the way to bring costs down without undermining the quality of care provided to @entity22 patients			0
@entity11 's vision for @entity22 is very different			2
he wants an unaccountable board of bureaucrats to cut fees to those caring for @entity22 patients			0
but cutting fees is n't real cost control			0
low reimbursement rates will just force doctors and hospitals to stop taking care of @entity22 patients and thereby impair their access to care			0
for @entity22 , the @entity38 plan would shift power and financial control to the states so that they can reform their programs in ways that best suit the needs of their residents			1
in addition to mending entitlement programs , the @entity38 plan calls for top - to - bottom reform of the federal bureaucracy , with an emphasis on cutting programs of low or marginal value so that more money can be invested in what truly matters			1
most importantly , the plan does not adopt the deep reductions in defense spending that would cripple the military just as threats around the world are expanding and intensifying			2
over the next decade , the @entity38 budget would cut federal spending by $ 5.3 trillion , compared with @entity11 's proposal			1
the differences between the @entity38 and the president 's plans are stark on the tax side , too			1
the president has proposed to increase taxes to 20 % of @entity27 in 2022			0
the @entity38 plan would hold the line on tax hikes and keep revenue at roughly its historical norm of just above 18 % of gdp			1
further , it calls for fundamental reform of both individual and corporate taxes , including the consolidation of today 's complex six - rate structure for individuals into just two rates -- 10 % and 25 %			0
this is the kind of tax reform that some tax experts believe would promote job creation in the @entity7 economy			1
the @entity7 people now have before them two clear and very different approaches for how to address the nation 's fundamental economic challenges			1
one vision would preserve the status quo , with growing entitlement commitments , steady hikes in tax rates and more centralized control of the economy from the government			0
the other vision would bolster a vibrant private sector with sensible taxes ; reform of entitlements and other programs that emphasize limited but effective government ; protection of the most vulnerable among us ; and the power of free markets to promote prosperity			1
these competing plans give voters a real choice when they go the polls in november			0
and whatever they decide , the consequences will be lasting .			0
