-- on its face , the now - viral photo of @entity3 's prime minister @entity2 taking a " selfie " with president @entity4 and @entity6 prime minister @entity5 € ” at a memorial service for anti-apartheid hero @entity8 , no lessâ € ” looks wildly inappropriate			1
and no question , president @entity4 has taken a lot of media heat for participating			1
( it did n't help that the expression on @entity19 's face appeared to be disapproving			2
) in the realm of funeral etiquette , those two factorsâ € ” the memorial service , the glowering wife -- taken together , scream " social faux pas			1
" but there was more to the story behind the image			0
@entity29 , the photographer who captured the photo told the " today " show that he shot the picture during a jovial , celebratory portion of the service			1
he said people were dancing , singing and laughing as they celebrated the life of @entity8			1
@entity19 , he said , had been laughing along with the trio seconds before he snapped the image			0
but a few questions remain			0
is it proper to take a selfie at a funeral ? and was president @entity4 out of line for doing so -- because he is the president , you know			1
under the circumstances @entity2 described , i 'd say the selfie was not necessarily in poor taste for the president			1
but was it poor form ? as @entity54 , a man watched and scrutinized at every angle , he is no doubt very careful about how his behavior is perceived			0
he surely knew that picture would wind up pinging around the @entity59 and on the evening news and cleverly headlined front pages			0
perhaps he wanted to send a message to the people , anyway , to say , " hey , i 'm just like you			0
" now if he wanted to avoid the scrutiny altogether and send a more somber message to the public , he might have held off and joined in on the picture in a more private setting			0
the moment , however , did not seem to call for such discretion			0
what 's my bottom line ? president @entity4 's behavior was appropriate for that particular occasion , for that particular culture at that precise moment			1
and what is the protocol for behavior at funerals for the rest of us : selfies and beyond ? well , if you , too , happen to attend a funeral or memorial service at a stadium where the people are up dancing and singing and laughing in the aisles , then it 's perfectly fine to take a selfie with your seat mates			1
the key here is that there is a proper time and place for everything , and that 's where decorum comes in			0
that i would need to explain this will seem surprising to some , but this is , after all , a time when websites such as @entity111 at a funeral exist			0
so bear with me : firing off a selfie during a solemn moment such as the prayer or scripture reading is highly inappropriate and terribly disrespectful			1
the same shot during the gathering or meal service afterward is all right			2
taking photos within the confines of the church or synagogue or funeral home can be perceived as highly inappropriate			1
it is important to be aware of this and remain respectful of the family , the culture and the environment you are in			0
funerals and memorials take on a different meaning from culture to culture ; some are very somber , others quite celebratory			2
it is our duty to be sensitive to the entire moment and in some cases it might be difficult to tell what that requires			0
here 's a handy rule of thumb : to avoid offending , err on the side of caution and just hold off on that selfie until the funeral has ended			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity153 .			2

@entity153 : @entity4 " selfie " with @entity156 at @entity8 memorial looked inappropriate
but photog said it was during celebratory part of service ; first lady had been *smiling* , too
she says selfie appropriate for @entity4 , given circumstances , but not usually ok at funerals
@entity153 : in church , synagogue , at services , selfies not ok etiquette . wait until afterward
