doctors in @entity2 , @entity3 , told @entity4 that her daughter , @entity5 , might not live another three months			1
that was the middle of march , when @entity5 's brain was being short - circuited by hundreds of seizures a day , overrunning the array of five potent drugs meant to control them			1
worse , the drugs were damaging @entity5 's organs			2
" she was maxed out , " @entity4 said			2
" she 'd quit breathing several times a day , and the doctors blamed it on the seizure medications			2
" @entity4 had heard that a form of medical marijuana might help , but it was n't available in central @entity3			2
so a week after hearing the ominous diagnosis , she and @entity5 packed up and moved to @entity21 , @entity22			2
there , @entity5 began a regimen of cannabis oil : four times a day and once at night			2
by summer , she was down to just a handful of seizures a day			2
in less than three months , doctors were able to wean her off @entity30 , a powerful medication that had been damaging her liver			2
@entity5 had never been able to walk or talk			2
but freed from seizures in @entity22 , " she said ' mama ' for the first time , " @entity4 said			2
" she 's playing with puzzles ; she 's walking			2
she 's almost being a normal child			2
" despite all the good news , @entity4 is living in limbo			2
her husband , a paramedic , could n't afford to leave his job and pension ; he still lives and works in @entity41 , @entity3			2
the family is relying on charity to keep their @entity22 apartment for the next few months ; beyond that , the future is uncertain			2
a bill being introduced monday in the @entity49 @entity48 could be @entity4 's ticket home			1
the three - page bill would amend the @entity52 -- the federal law that criminalizes marijuana -- to exempt plants with an extremely low percentage of @entity57 , the chemical that makes users high			1
@entity60 : why i changed my mind on weed if passed , it would be the first time that federal law allows any medical marijuana use			1
" no one should face a choice of having their child suffer or moving to @entity22 and splitting up their family , " said rep. @entity68 , @entity69 , the bill 's sponsor			1
" we live in @entity49 , and if there 's something that would make my child better , and they ca n't get it because of the government , that 's not right			1
" the bill will land in a @entity86 that may be open to change			1
across the country , highly sympathetic patients and a nonintoxicating product have proved a popular mix. this year alone , 11 states have passed legislation loosening regulation of cannabis strains with high cannabidiol and / or minimal @entity57 content			1
in this atmosphere , @entity68 says that once members and their staffs are brought up to speed , he expects the bill to attract " overwhelming " support			1
" it would n't be surprising if we see broad support for this proposal , " agreed @entity103 , communications director at the @entity104 , which advocates for marijuana and medical marijuana legalization			0
" if this bill gets support , it will demonstrate that there is recognition of marijuana 's medical benefits			1
" dubbed the @entity119 of 2014 , the bill is named after @entity120 , a young @entity22 girl whose parents have campaigned nationwide for easier access to medical marijuana after successfully controlling their daughter 's seizures with cannabis oil			1
since her story became known , a growing number of parents have flocked to @entity22 , hoping for similar success			0
the @entity119 cannabis strain , developed by the realm of caring nonprofit organization in @entity21 , is in high demand , in part because of the attention it 's received in the media			1
many families wait months for a batch to be grown and processed into cannabis oil			0
@entity68 's bill , however , would apply to any cannabis strain with a @entity57 content of less than 0.3 %			1
@entity119 and similar strains not only have minimal @entity57 , they have high levels of cannabidiol , another chemical			1
a growing body of anecdotal evidence suggests that cannabidiol can effectively control seizures , though there are no published studies to support its use			0
it 's easy to find critics who say parents should follow a more traditional route			0
" there is no evidence for marijuana as a treatment for seizures , " rep. @entity161 , @entity162 , a physician , claimed during a congressional hearing last month			1
" we hear anecdotal stories , and that 's how myths come about			0
" @entity161 and others point out that a pharmaceutical version of cannabidiol oil , called @entity176 , is being tested in clinical trials			0
but many children are n't able to get into the trials			0
@entity180 is disqualified because she has type - 1 diabetes			0
others are n't willing to wait several months to be enrolled			0
" with @entity176 , there just are n't enough seats at the table , " said @entity183 , a father from @entity184 , @entity69 , whose story helped inspire @entity68 's bill			1
his daughter @entity190 , 11 , has epilepsy and suffers anywhere from a handful of seizures a day to more than 100 , despite her four anti-convulsant medications			0
@entity183 , the chief financial officer of a large @entity197 medical nonprofit , says @entity190 has been evaluated at several top hospitals but could n't land a spot in the @entity176 trial			0
twenty - three states and the @entity202 have laws on the books allowing medical marijuana for a variety of conditions			0
but even as states rewrite their regulations , federal law remains the same : marijuana is illegal to grow , sell or use for any purpose			1
under the 1970 @entity52 , marijuana is listed on @entity52 , meaning it has " no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse			1
" to backers of reform , the @entity218 is familiar : marijuana is restricted in large part because there is little research to support medical uses ; research is difficult to conduct because of tight restrictions			0
a series of memos from the @entity230 has said that arresting individual medical marijuana users is not a priority , and a 2013 memo added that federal prosecutors should not target large commercial operations except on a case - by - case basis			1
but most observers say that shipping or transporting the drug across state lines ups the ante			0
" for families like us , the biggest issue is the federal issue			1
you ca n't take it across state lines , " @entity183 explained			0
his family still lives in @entity184			0
but after seeing @entity1 's medical marijuana documentary last year , @entity190 and her mother , @entity250 , established residency in @entity22 , where they obtained a medical marijuana card that let them place an order for a batch cannabis oil , in hopes it will control @entity190 's seizures			0
if @entity68 's bill becomes law , @entity183 says , " @entity263 could just put it in a @entity266 package			1
" the @entity267 is conducting a review of scientific evidence to determine whether marijuana warrants looser treatment , but a spokeswoman says there 's no set date to complete the analysis			0
a review in 2011 ended with the @entity277 leaving marijuana 's status unaltered			0
but certain actions in @entity86 give @entity68 and his supporters hope			1
this month , the @entity48 passed a bill allowing banks to handle cash proceeds from dispensaries and other legal marijuana businesses			1
the most recent @entity287 allows industrial hemp -- a strain of cannabis without @entity57 -- to be grown for academic or research purposes			1
that did n't stop the @entity277 from seizing a shipment of hemp seeds bound for the @entity295 this spring			0
in response , the @entity300 , with support from @entity298 minority leader @entity297 of @entity299 , passed an amendment blocking @entity277 funds for anti-hemp enforcement			0
in may , the @entity48 passed a measure blocking money for @entity277 raids on marijuana dispensaries that are legal under state law			1
and just last week , sen. @entity310 of @entity299 took it a step further , introducing an amendment to the @entity314 that would forbid federal prosecution of doctors and patients whose actions are legal under state medical marijuana laws			1
" if states allow doctors to prescribe medical marijuana , and people are in good faith prescribing medical marijuana , we want to make sure it 's ok and that the federal government does n't come in and prosecute somebody , " said @entity320 , @entity310 's communications director			1
the amendment seems likely to die amidst wrangling over the @entity314 , but @entity331 says his boss plans to move forward on a standalone measure			0
too many people have been sentenced to long prison terms for possession of marijuana , @entity331 says			0
" @entity338 has gone overboard			0
" @entity183 does n't want to uproot his family to move to @entity22			0
but he says his hand may be forced			0
" we 're taking this situation one day at a time			0
" that 's where @entity4 was a few months ago			0
she had n't heard about @entity68 's bill until she got a call from a reporter but says she understands where the @entity69 families are coming from			1
she 's angry at home - state lawmakers who failed to push through @entity3 's cannabidiol oil bill this spring			1
" i lived in @entity3 for 17 years , " she said , " but here in @entity22 , i met my child for the first time , at the age of 5			0
" medical marijuana research stalls after @entity359 professor is let go			0

@entity361 of 2014 would amend @entity52
federal bill introduced in @entity49 @entity48 by rep. @entity68
@entity365 would exempt plants with low percentage of @entity57 , chemical that makes users high
