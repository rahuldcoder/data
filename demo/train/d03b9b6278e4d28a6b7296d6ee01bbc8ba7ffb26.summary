-- @entity1 's premium service @entity1 , which launched as a preview in july and recently opened up to everyone , is now out of testing period and has a new price tag of $ 7.99 per month			1
@entity1 gives subscribers access to all the episodes in a season of popular shows such as " @entity11 , " " @entity12 , " " @entity13 , " " @entity14 , " " @entity15 , " " @entity16 " and others			1
it also lets subscribers watch the shows on devices such as the @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and ( newly added ) @entity24 , with support for @entity26 , @entity27 , and many internet - enabled hdtvs , blu - ray players and media centers coming in the following months			2
originally , @entity1 cost $ 9.99 ; current subscribers who joined during the preview period will receive a credit for the difference from the original price , which will automatically be applied to their next billing cycle			2
recently , @entity1 shared some impressive stats : 30 million users and an estimated $ 240 million in revenue in 2010			0
the price drop for the @entity1 service , however , probably means that interest from subscribers was lacking ; we 'll see how the service will do at the lower price point			0
unfortunately for folks outside of the @entity47 , @entity1 is still only available in that country , despite recent hints that it plans to expand internationally soon			0
