@entity0 -- the looming decision on @entity3 is likely to preoccupy @entity4 for the next couple of weeks and complicate president @entity7 's domestic agenda			1
@entity7 's push for military intervention against @entity11 's regime over alleged chemical weapons use could push aside his top priorities on immigration and health care			1
because he decided to seek congressional approval and now faces strident opposition from many lawmakers and the public to his idea , @entity7 is having to go all - in in his sales job			2
his vigorous public relations campaign is all - consuming -- precious time that could have been used guiding an immigration bill through the @entity26 and informing the public about a new program to obtain health insurance under @entity29			1
need vs. want in the world of need and want , though , immigration falls under the " want " category			2
the @entity26 scheduled only nine days of work this month			1
@entity26 minority leader @entity36 , @entity37 , said a vote on the @entity3 resolution might not come until next week , the second and last week the @entity26 is in session this month			1
what about october or november ? good question			0
the @entity26 has other pressing matters to address -- issues that have deadlines			1
the new fiscal year begins october 1 and that 's wrapped up in a whole host of difficult topics , including the forced federal budget cuts that went into effect this year ( and will have an even greater impact on defense and domestic programs next year )			1
if @entity3 takes up a good portion of the @entity26 's work period in september and it does n't get to work on government spending , two things could happen : the government shuts down or @entity4 could pass a short - term spending bill to keep it running for a limited amount of time			1
house speaker @entity63 has indicated he will propose a spending bill to keep the government open until december , pushing the contentious but mandatory debate to later this year			1
government funding is not the only complication to immigration			1
the nation 's debt limit -- or its ability to borrow money to pay its bills --- will need to be raised by @entity4 sometime in " mid-october , " according to treasury secretary @entity75			1
he said that 's when the @entity77 will hit its $ 16.7 trillion borrowing limit and be unable to meet its credit obligations			2
both raising the debt limit and passing mandatory government spending bills are common duties of @entity4 that have been fraught with crippling partisanship in recent years			1
@entity84 have indicated this time will be no different			0
they plan to force the president 's hand on either one or both issues to force additional spending cuts or defund the president 's health care law			2
in other words , in addition to @entity3 , two complicated , political and mandatory issues are going to take far greater precedent over immigration -- an item on the president 's wish list			2
the immigration bill could be " dealt a pretty serious blow , " congressional scholar @entity100 with the @entity101 said			0
a crowded megaphone now that he has to sell a war - weary public about an intervention in @entity3 , his rollout of a massive public relations campaign on @entity29 could suffer			1
the success of public outreach on health care is vital for the law to work			0
as people can start signing up for the health insurance program on october 1 , the @entity114 found that one - third of the country , and 43 % of the uninsured have heard " nothing at all " about the public health care option			0
if people do n't know about it , people wo n't sign up for the public exchanges			0
a detrimental factor for the law as participation is critical for viability of the law			0
@entity7 announced that he will address the nation on @entity3 on tuesday night			0
also on tuesday , the president is personally lobbying members of @entity4 on @entity134 on the resolution to authorize a limited military strike			2
while the president turns his full attention to @entity3 and the vote in @entity4 , previously scheduled items are falling by the wayside			2
@entity7 canceled a speech to the annual @entity143 conference in @entity37 , an opportunity to discuss domestic issues , including health care			0
the president 's complete focus on @entity3 not only means he will have fewer opportunities to talk to the public about domestic priorities , but the media is focused on the drama building in @entity4 , too , drowning out any coverage of health care			1
a cursory search for news stories on the health care law shows a paltry 50 articles			0
( that 's bad news for the president because the articles contained good news for the health care law			0
a report found that premiums for the government - sponsored exchanges would be much more affordable than expected			0
) comparatively , a simple internet search for news articles on @entity3 resulted in more than 2,000 news stories			0
" there 's only a certain amount of bandwidth of issues that can be discussed on tv or voters will be talking about , " @entity100 said			0
@entity84 agenda at risk , too while the president 's fall agenda is at risk , the @entity84 agenda might suffer , too			2
some of the most conservative members of @entity4 hoped to throw a massive wrench in the gears of @entity29 as they began to turn by attempting to defund the program			1
senators @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190 , @entity191 , are among those taking part in a @entity195 rally to defund the program tuesday in @entity0			0
with @entity4 in its first week back from vacation and the agenda topped by @entity3 , it 's likely to get little attention -- or the message could morph into an @entity203 rally			1
congressional scholar @entity204 with the @entity205 said there could be a " silver lining " to @entity3 crowding out immigration and health care			0
he said the seriousness of the issue could make it more difficult for lawmakers to " engage in this kind of brinksmanship			0

*prospects* for @entity26 to take up immigration *reform* this fall in jeopardy
efforts to inform public about @entity29 could be *overshadowed*
possible government *shutdown* over budget looms huge as end of fiscal year nears
@entity4 must also consider raising the debt *ceiling* to pay nation 's bills
