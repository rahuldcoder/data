-- the day after the biggest murder trial in recent @entity6 history , the country 's state media ran stories about the defendant , @entity8 , the high - powered wife of deposed @entity6 politician @entity9 , but kept headlines off the front page			1
the court is still deliberating the case against @entity8			2
she and a family aide , @entity14 , are accused of poisoning @entity16 businessman @entity15 in a hotel room in the city of @entity19 last november			0
according to a court official , @entity8 's defense team raised no objection to the prosecution 's charges , detailed thursday in a one - day trial , a month after she and @entity14 were charged with murder			1
before thursday 's court appearance , @entity8 and @entity14 had n't been seen publicly since their arrest in april -- and they have been unreachable for comment			1
on friday , most major @entity6 publications including the @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 published stories about the trial , but they were relegated to page three and beyond			1
one article in the @entity43 included a sketched image of @entity8 , but otherwise no photos were published and the reports carried the same story published on state - run news agency , @entity48			1
discussion about @entity8 's trial and the surrounding scandal was blocked on social media friday , but netizens in @entity6 appeared to be using code names to evade censors			1
one user on @entity57 , the @entity6 microblogging site , referred to @entity9 , the former @entity60 chief of @entity19 , and his wife , @entity8 as " @entity62			1
" the user wrote : " @entity62 case is under strict censorship in @entity6 thus not seen on media , all we can see is the standard @entity69 version			2
by contrast the case is attracting intense international attention and making headlines almost everywhere			0
" " the immense international attention is natural considering how high - level it is and the great impact on @entity6 politics			2
" some netizens expressed support for @entity9 , referring to him as " @entity9 " and wrote about missing his leadership			0
other posts played off @entity9 's last name , which can mean thin , weak or poor in @entity6 , and some obliquely used the word " tomato , " apparently to refer to @entity19 , which literally means " the red city in the west			2
" @entity8 's trial has been closely watched by international media , however proceedings were closed to international journalists who clustered outside the court house in @entity93 thursday			1
after the trial , @entity6 - run state television , @entity69 showed clips of @entity8 appearing before the court and walking outside flanked by police			1
" it 's a very carefully staged , supposedly public trial , but it is n't public at all , " said @entity99 , a law professor at @entity100			2
" it 's just carefully organized and highly limited in who can attend			0
" the @entity105 - like saga involving @entity8 and @entity9 has become one of the most sensational @entity6 political scandals in recent memory			2
before the allegations in the case came to light , @entity9 was considered to be a strong contender for entry to the @entity114 , the nine - member team that steers @entity6 policy			0
but , @entity9 has now been stripped of all his political titles and is being investigated for what officials call , " serious disciplinary violations			0
" he has been out of the public eye and unreachable for comment			0
however , when the scandal first broke , @entity9 denied any wrongdoing and accused critics of slinging mud at the family for political reasons			0
the scandal comes just months before the country 's senior leaders meet to hand over the reins of power to the next generation of leaders , a once - in - a - decade event			0
@entity8 and a family aide , @entity14 , are accused of poisoning @entity15 , a 41 - year - old @entity16 businessman who was found dead in november in the southwestern @entity6 metropolis of @entity19 , the city where @entity9 was the @entity60 chief			2
@entity8 's trial ended after seven hours on thursday			1
the verdict will be delivered at a later date after deliberations , according @entity143 , deputy head of the @entity144			0
@entity143 delivered a statement to the press after the trial thursday , divulging some details of the case against @entity8			1
@entity6 authorities have said that @entity8 and her son had " conflicts " with @entity15 " over economic interests " and that she was motivated to kill the @entity154 because of fears for her son 's safety			1
@entity99 , the co-director of @entity100 's @entity159 - @entity158 , suggested that attempts to block discussion of the trial on social media might only encourage speculation and rumor amongst the @entity6 public			1
in the absence of facts , rumors can spawn " some very sophisticated conspiracy theories , many of which are wrong , " he said			0
" unless there is some kind of investigation reported to the public i think the @entity6 people who are highly sophisticated and now have the internet and social media , they will remain very , very suspicious of what 's going on , " he said			1
@entity8 's trial is considered one of @entity6 's most high - profile cases since the @entity183 trial in 1980			1
the @entity183 , comprised of four officials including the widow of @entity186 , was tried for their role in the country 's ill - fated @entity188			0
all four were imprisoned after a trial that lasted for six weeks			0
@entity99 said he watched their televised trial in @entity6 more than three decades ago			2
since then , " there have been enormous changes , " he said			0
" now you have codes of law , you have legal institutions , hundreds of thousands of judges , prosecutors , lawyers , a lot more experience than they had before			0
but in the end , one has to ask what has changed fundamentally with respect to criminal justice ? " @entity1 's @entity208 and intern @entity143 contributed to this report .			0

@entity6 media published the same story about @entity8
discussions about murder trial have been banned on @entity6 social media
@entity8 's murder trial on thursday lasted 7 hours
