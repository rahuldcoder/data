the latest abductions in the villages of @entity25 and @entity26 raise serious questions about recent @entity14 government claims that more than 200 girls abducted by @entity9 in april would be released soon as part of a ceasefire with the @entity4 militants			1
@entity9 has remained silent on the deal the government said it signed with the group in neighboring @entity35 last week			1

@entity85 , who studies jihad , has doubts about the ceasefire deal going through			0
" it remains to be seen whether this truce will actually materialize , whether it is merely an election ploy for @entity14 's embattled president , @entity92 , and most crucially whether it will bring about the release of numerous captives taken by @entity9 during the past year , " he wrote in an analysis for @entity0			1
the @entity95 have employed particularly bloody tactics this year , killing thousands			0
