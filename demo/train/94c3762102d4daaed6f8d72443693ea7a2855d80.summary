@entity0 walked into a @entity1 in @entity2 , @entity3 , grabbing a bag of @entity5 and a can of @entity8 iced tea			1
the hood from his dark gray sweatshirt over his head , he walked up to the counter , reached deep into his pants ' pockets , paid the clerk , then walked out			2
this seemingly mundane act , captured on a surveillance video , would be the last image the 17 - year - old 's loved ones would have of him alive			0
while questions still remain , what happened next to @entity0 on the night of february 26 became clearer on thursday with the release of scores of pages of investigative and medical examiner 's reports , in addition to new images of @entity0 's shooter and the @entity1 video			1
@entity0 did n't live in @entity2 , a central @entity3 city of about 53,000 people			1
yet by that winter night , he 'd been there for seven days , after being suspended for the third time from dr. @entity35 in @entity37 , in this instance , for 10 days after drug residue was found in his backpack , according to records obtained by the @entity42			0
his father @entity43 had taken his son four hours away from home because neither he or @entity0 's mother wanted the teen to stay in his hometown where he could enjoy time with his friends , family friend and former football coach @entity52 recalled later			1
that sunday night , @entity0 was supposed to be getting a snack and heading back to the @entity2 home of his father 's fiance			1
it was on that walk back that he encountered @entity59 , a 28 - year - old neighborhood watch volunteer			1
some details as to @entity0 's thought process around that time may someday be gleaned from what he told his girlfriend back in @entity37 in a cell phone conversation , his family 's lawyers said			1
the boyfriend and girlfriend spoke at 7:12 p.m. @entity59 's voice , meanwhile , comes through on a 911 call he made around that time , telling a dispatcher about " a real suspicious guy			1
" " this guy looks like he 's up to no good , or he 's on drugs or something			0
it 's raining , and he 's just walking around			0
" the dispatcher asked @entity59 , who 'd called 911 at least four times previously for other incidents , if he was following the person			2
he replies , " yes			0
we do n't need you to do that , " the dispatcher responded			0
but @entity59 followed him anyway			2
what happened next is a matter of dispute			0
@entity0 and @entity59 were obviously in the middle of it , but no one else saw all that happened			1
one witness later told police that " she heard a commotion , which sounded like arguing , " while another mentioned " loud talking			2
" and on one 911 call , placed by a neighbor , a police sergeant counted one man yelling " help ! " or " help me ! " 14 times in a span of 38 seconds			0
who was yelling ? when the 911 calls were later played back for him and he was asked if they were from his son , an emotional @entity107 " quietly responded ' no '			0
" but an @entity109 analysis , also detailed on thursday , said it could n't be determined whose voice it was due to the " extreme emotional state " of whomever was yelling , a lack of words from which to compare , overlapping voices and " insufficient voice quality " on the recording			0
the same analysis also did n't reach conclusions as to whether @entity59 used a racial epithet to describe @entity0 on his own 911 call , as some have alleged			1
@entity0 's family have said they believe @entity59 , a white @entity126 , profiled the @entity129 - @entity128 teen			1
numerous witnesses , however , did clearly hear a gunshot			0
it came from @entity59 's black , 9mm semiautomatic hand gun			2
the bullet went into @entity0 's left chest and lodged there			2
police headed to the neighborhood after @entity59 's initial 911 call , but did n't arrive until after the fatal shot			1
they found @entity0 " face down in the grass			2
" a sergeant checked and could n't find a pulse			0
for the next six minutes , he and another police officer teamed up to conduct cpr on the teen			2
a plastic bag , brought by a neighbor , was used to seal his chest wound			0
firefighters and @entity153 from the @entity154 arrived at 7:27 p.m. , to continue efforts to try to save him			0
three minutes later , at 7:30 p.m. , @entity0 was pronounced dead			1
aside from a small scratch on one finger , that gunshot wound was the only apparent injury the teenager suffered			0
a medical examiner 's report later found trace elements of @entity164 , an element of marijuana , in his system , though experts pointed out the challenge in equating the levels found with @entity0 's level of intoxication at the time of his death			2
one officer who lifted @entity0 's shirt at the scene " felt a large , cold can in the center pocket " of the teen 's hoodie , which was the iced tea he 'd bought just minutes before			1
blood was later spotted on his @entity5 , along with a lighter , a @entity184 brand cell phone , headphones and $ 40 and some change			0
a witness told police that , after the gunshot , she saw a " larger " man standing over @entity0			1
police who arrived described the shooter , @entity59 , as compliant in answering their questions and willingly putting on handcuffs			1
he had blood on his nose -- with one officer saying it appeared " broken , " while noting " swelling " of his face -- and , as photographs showed , blood on the back of his head			1
his back was wet and soiled , as if he 'd been in grass			0
@entity59 claimed that @entity0 had attacked him , hitting him in the nose and knocking him back into the pavement			1
it was only then , in self - defense , that he 'd taken out his gun and shot the teen , he said			0
@entity214 , the results of which were made public thursday , would show evidence of @entity59 's hands on the firearm , but not @entity0 's			1
an analysis of scrapings from underneath the teenager 's fingernails did not contain any of @entity59 's dna , as might rub off in the case of a prolonged struggle			1
at the scene , @entity59 declined to be transported to the hospital despite his apparent injuries			2
a police officer reiterated that offer after @entity59 complained his head hurt and he felt lightheaded while being driven to the @entity232			1
but again he turned it down			0
while at the police station , @entity59 requested some tissues , water and to go to the bathroom , but little else			1
he ended up turning over his clothes to police but , after being questioned and putting on a change of clothes brought in by his wife , he headed home			0
@entity107 , meanwhile , did n't know where his son was			0
he filed a missing person 's complaint on the morning of february 27 , telling authorities that his son had n't returned from going to the store the previous evening			0
@entity249 then showed @entity107 a picture taken from the crime scene , and he confirmed the dead teenager was , in fact , @entity0			1
as to @entity59 , he remained in limbo for weeks			2
police had declined to arrest him that night , saying there was n't enough evidence to refute his self - defense claim			0
in a capias request , a request that someone be taken into custody , on march 13 , police described what happened as " ultimately avoidable by @entity59 , if @entity59 had remained in his vehicle and awaited the arrival of law enforcement , or conversely if he had identified himself to @entity107 as a concerned citizen and initiated dialog ( sic ) in an effort to dispel each party 's concern			1
" there is no indication that @entity0 was involved in any criminal activity			2
" on april 11 , special prosecutor @entity277 announced that @entity59 was being charged with second - degree murder			2
he was subsequently arrested and , eventually , released on bail			0
the start of his scheduled trial has not yet been set .			0

@entity59 shot and killed @entity0 on february 26
new details released thursday show how police *crafted* their case
@entity0 was pronounced dead minutes after police arrived
@entity59 had a bloody nose and head , photographs show
