if it were up to @entity2 , she would have never left her family in @entity4			1
@entity2 , a college graduate , says she had little choice			1
" it was a challenge to find a job in @entity4 , " said @entity2 , 24 , who graduated from the @entity6 with a political science degree in 2012			2
" unfortunately , finding work in government can be challenging , especially since it 's the island 's main source of employment			2
" @entity2 did everything she was supposed to do : she got her degree , worked as an intern in various places and even landed a part - time position with the @entity20			0
now , @entity2 is one of thousands of @entity4 who have left the @entity23 territory in recent years in search of a better life in the @entity23 mainland			1
opinion : citizenship is a birthright in @entity23 territories in 2011 and 2012 , about 55,000 residents migrated from the island to the mainland each year , according to the @entity35 's @entity34			2
the @entity36 is still collecting data for those who left in 2013 , but it estimates the numbers are about the same			0
while @entity4 have migrated to the @entity23 for several generations , the number of departures from 2000 - 2010 marks the largest migration wave , at 300,000 , since the 1950s , when close to a half - million migrated to the mainland during the entire decade			2
so many residents have left the island over the years that there are a million more @entity4 living in the mainland @entity23 ( 4.9 million as of 2011 ) than in @entity4 ( 3.7 million )			1
why such a massive population shift in recent years ? @entity49 , executive director of the @entity51 , says it 's mainly because of the 2006 recession that is still punishing the island 's economy			2
@entity4 's unemployment rate is above 15 % , more than double the 7.3 % in the mainland , according to the @entity57			1
last month , @entity58 's announced it had cut @entity4 's credit rating to junk status as the @entity23 commonwealth faces $ 70 billion in debt , including the debt from its utility companies			1
last week , in an attempt to avoid financial ruin , @entity4 gov. @entity65 signed a bill authorizing the sale of $ 3.5 million in tax - free general obligation bonds			1
even if the auction is successful , the bonds are considered pretty risky			0
in other words , if you thought @entity74 was in trouble , @entity4 is much worse mainly for this reason : unlike @entity74 , the island can not file for bankruptcy court protection			1
that option is only for municipalities and @entity4 is an unincorporated territory			2
in 2012 , a majority rejected the current status and favored statehood as an alternative , hoping that might help alleviate the territory 's economic woes			2
but the vote was nonbinding and never went anywhere in @entity91			0
@entity4 favor statehood for first time for @entity2 , getting a job was n't the only factor in her decision to leave @entity4			1
the rising cost of utilities , rent , gas and tolls were also something she needed to consider			0
" back home , i was sharing an apartment with six other students and still my expenses were taking up 70 % of my salary			1
it was simply impossible , " @entity2 said			0
while the cost of living in @entity111 is more than double the national average , the cost of living in @entity4 is not the best - case scenario for a recent college graduate			1
for example , basic monthly utilities including electricity , heating and water cost about $ 246 in @entity4 as opposed to @entity111 's $ 161			1
" @entity120 all depends on where you live in @entity4 , because while a middle class does exist , very few fall into that category , " said @entity123 , " the middle class has to spend a lot more money for quality of life			2
" for example , two years ago many @entity4 had to invest in water tanks after serious droughts sapped the water supply			0
the cost of purchasing and maintaining a water tank is n't something people in the @entity23 have to worry about , @entity123 added			0
also , the electric supply is n't as reliable in @entity4 as it is in the @entity23 , so @entity4 have to pay more to protect their televisions and computers			1
" the power goes off for a microsecond every day in @entity4 and electronic items do n't take well to that			1
so , anyone with an electronic item worth having has to invest in a universal power supply , which costs about $ 100 here , " @entity123 said			0
@entity4 are n't just moving to @entity111 , where many have typically migrated in the past			1
they are also moving to @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 -- wherever there are jobs			0
" since the early 20th century , @entity4 have been contributing to create what some scholars are calling ' @entity164 , ' " said @entity158 , director of center for @entity160 at @entity161 in @entity111			0
" with an influx of @entity167 , the south is becoming more diverse			0
" the latest influx of @entity4 includes people primarily between ages 20 and 40 , he said			0
" families and young children are migrating as well -- basically entire households are moving , " @entity158 said			0
while many @entity4 migrating to the @entity23 are young , educated professionals like @entity2 , they also include people from across the socioeconomic spectrum , according to the @entity178 for @entity160 , which examines the migration phenomenon			0
opinion : treat @entity23 citizens in @entity4 fairly " in @entity4 , there 's a generalized perspective that there 's a ' brain drain ' because so many young professionals have left , " said @entity158 , " but they are n't the only ones leaving			1
" it 's also labor workers and families			0
we did n't find any over-representation of a certain kind of people			0
" @entity4 's education system spends close to $ 8,000 annually per student , according to the @entity198			1
and while that 's not as high as the @entity23 , which spends an average of $ 10,000 per student , it 's still a significant loss for @entity4 , particularly as it faces a major economic crisis			1
each college - educated @entity4 who establishes a career elsewhere is a big loss for the commonwealth , explained @entity4 political analyst @entity207 in an interview with @entity209 en @entity210			2
" why invest so much time and money for a student in @entity4 only to have them leave to the @entity23 and contribute to society elsewhere ? " @entity207 said			0
there 's even an active recruiting process by @entity23 - based organizations , like police departments , nurse associations and hospitals , who come to @entity4 to search for future employees , @entity123 said			2
" they not only recruit the best bilingual candidates but they help diversify the workforce in the @entity23 , of course to their benefit , " said @entity123			0
it 's a seamless process considering all @entity4 , whether born on the island territory or on the mainland , are @entity23 citizens			1
@entity123 added that it 's not just the money that 's attracting residents to leave the island			0
" it 's also an opportunity to work in a world class field that cares about your profession			0
but it is unfortunate that @entity4 can not do much for the talent it produces , " he said			0
@entity2 said her decision to leave the island was n't just to alleviate her current situation : she knew she would have more long - term career opportunities in @entity111 than if she stayed in @entity4			1
according to @entity158 , the likelihood that @entity2 will return to @entity4 is slim , because so many @entity4 who migrate to the mainland settle down and stay			0
yet @entity2 said she has n't given up on her goal to improve things back home			1
" seeing the way @entity111 operates makes you notice what @entity4 lacks and makes me want to go back and do things a different way , " @entity2 said			2
" but it does not depend on us , it depends whether @entity4 's government will allow us to contribute in the reconstruction of our country			1

@entity4 college graduate shares her story on why she left the island
@entity58 cut @entity4 's credit rating to junk status last month in face of $ 70 billion debt
" i was sharing an apartment with 6 others and my expenses were still 70 % of my salary "
@entity279 says she has n't given up on her goal to improve things in @entity4
