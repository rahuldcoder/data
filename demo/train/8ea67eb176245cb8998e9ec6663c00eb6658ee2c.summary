picked up significantly over the weekend , earning a $ 28 million opening on 3,525 screens			1
this is better than it was tracking on friday , likely due to the fact that families waited until the weekend to see the film			0
still , it 's nowhere near what the movie needed to take in on its opening weekend , and will likely not even come close to making up for its almost $ 200 million budget			1
review : ' @entity2 ' to put a little perspective on this march weekend , the same timeframe last year had an animated opening and an @entity21 movie that fared much better than " @entity22 " and " @entity23 " ( in third place ) : " @entity25 " opened at $ 70.2 million and " @entity26 " at $ 21.1 million			1
as the first $ 100 million movie of 2013 , " @entity29 " made $ 9.7 million in its fourth weekend in theaters			1
down 31 percent from last weekend , @entity31 's @entity30 and @entity33 comedy picked up eight new theaters			2
if it was n't obvious that " @entity29 " was a runaway success , the r - rated movie has already made three times its opening weekend			1
@entity37 and company should be anxious to find out if the @entity33 / @entity40 vehicle " @entity42 " will boast similar profits when it opens in june			0
@entity43 ' " @entity23 " ( @entity4 : @entity46 ) had a $ 9 million opening weekend in 2,771 locations , with a $ 3,248 per screen average			1
directed by first time directors @entity48 and @entity49 , @entity51 's $ 13 million party movie should be able to make back its budget , but it is surely disappointing that the film came in at less than half of " @entity26 's " opening weekend			1
" @entity26 " dropped off 47 percent in its second weekend , and , if " @entity23 " follows that trend , it will at least slide past the $ 13 million mark			1
although " @entity61 " ( @entity4 : c - ) was tracking pretty similarly to " @entity23 " on friday , the poorly rated horror film lost a little steam over the weekend , bringing in only $ 8 million in 2,700 locations , with a $ 2,974 location average			2
the first " @entity65 " opened in late august 2010 at $ 20.4 million			0
though it only ended up making twice that in its lifetime , with a $ 1.8 million budget , it 's no wonder @entity70 thought that they might be able to repeat @entity72 's success			2
so far , " @entity61 " has made up its $ 5 million production budget , and surpassed the $ 3 million that @entity70 spent acquiring it , but considering the poor reviews and similarly bleak @entity4 , it 's very unlikely that it will hit the margins of the first film			2
rounding out the top five is @entity82 's " snitch			0
" down 41 percent in its second weekend , the $ 7.7 million weekend brings the @entity85 action flick to $ 24.4 million total			2
" @entity2 " -- $ 28 million 2			1
" identity thief " -- $ 9.7 million 3			0
" @entity23 " -- $ 9 million 4			0
" @entity61 " -- $ 8 million 5			0
" snitch " -- $ 7.7 million @entity90 's r - rated thriller " @entity91 " also opened in seven theaters for a $ 158,822 weekend , with a $ 22,698 location average			1
this is the first @entity95 film for the @entity97 director ( " @entity96 " ) , and was co-produced by @entity98 , @entity99 , and @entity100			0
the movie stars @entity102 and @entity103			0
