@entity0 -- a liberal advocacy group is blaming @entity3 for the @entity5 crisis in a new ad that will first air on tv in @entity8 next weekend			1
the @entity9 released an ad online late sunday that interlaces self - described " disturbing footages of the @entity5 outbreak " with a mash - up of top @entity3 -- including those tied up in crucial midterm contests and potential 2016 candidates -- saying the word " cut			1
" the ad describes how the @entity20 saw its discretionary funding cut by $ 585 million from 2010 to 2014 and the @entity22 has faced $ 446 million in cuts during the same period			1
the group plans to continue to play up public fears over the ebola virus in the final weeks leading up to the midterms and will modify the ad with state - specific versions to hit @entity3 @entity31 candidates like @entity33 's @entity32 and @entity35 's @entity34 who want to cut federal government spending , the group 's founder and president @entity39 said			1
@entity39 called the ad an " indictment " of @entity3 policies that have " led directly to thousands of deaths overseas " and said the ad is not " sensationalized " or " aggressive			1
" " people should be deathly afraid of @entity3 policies , " @entity39 said in an interview monday , adding that the link between the @entity5 crisis and the @entity3 focus on cutting government spending is " really straightforward			1
" complete coverage of the @entity5 outbreak responding to the ad , a spokesman for the @entity53 said the best way to fix the federal government is to remove " democrats from the driver 's seat in the @entity31			1
" " it 's odd in that the @entity57 blaming @entity0 for @entity5 have controlled @entity0 for the last six years , " he said			1
both the @entity20 and @entity22 were impacted by the sequester , across - the - board spending cuts that went into effect in 2013 when republicans and @entity57 in @entity65 could not come to an agreement on specific cuts that would offset the automatic slashing			0
the ad , " @entity76 , " ties republicans to the @entity5 outbreak , which has killed more than 4,000 people in @entity73 , but only one person in the @entity75			1
@entity39 said that there 's " no question " that the @entity5 death on @entity75 soil would not have happened if @entity3 were n't so focused on cutting government spending			2
" these people 's anti-government fever has reached such a level that it is damaging to our country 's ability to deal with this kind of issue , " @entity39 said			0
" we 're here because of them			0
" the ad , which the group said will make its debut on @entity8 airwaves this weekend , opens with a clip of senate minority leader @entity97 , who would likely become majority leader if @entity3 take back the @entity31 next month			1
" @entity0 actually can cut spending , " @entity99 says at the start of the ad			0
@entity99 is n't the only @entity31 contender featured in the ad			2
@entity106 and @entity107 , who are vying to unseat the @entity57 incumbent in @entity109 and @entity110 , respectively , also pop up in the spot			0
@entity5 becomes an election issue @entity113 , the senator from @entity114 who is facing independent businessman @entity115 , also flashes across the screen			0
the group plans to expand the ad to high airwaves in @entity31 races in @entity121 , @entity35 , @entity33 and @entity114 , @entity39 said			1
and the liberal group also attacks potential 2016 presidential contenders , with @entity124			0
@entity125 and @entity126 , sens. @entity127 and @entity128 as well as @entity105			0
@entity129 and @entity130 making an appearance alongside clips documenting the @entity5 outbreak			1
@entity127 's spokesman , @entity134 , blasted the @entity9 for being " a shadowy group of progressive political hit men " and said they " should be ashamed of themselves for blaming a whole political party for the ebola virus			0
" the organization itself is no stranger to controversy having been behind the 2011 ad that appears to show rep. @entity129 ( @entity146 ) pushing an elderly woman in an wheelchair off a cliff			0
the ad is n't the first time midterm politics have gotten an injection of @entity5			2
@entity3 candidate for @entity31 in @entity155 @entity154 also used the deadly disease to attack incumbent sen. @entity157 for not securing the @entity75 's southern border			2
@entity3 stokes border fears over @entity5 , @entity160 @entity34 also said the @entity75 should tighten border security to prevent an @entity5 outbreak in the @entity75 in a debate last week against sen. @entity164			1
@entity110 @entity57 sen. @entity165 also made @entity5 the focus of an ad attacking his challenger , rep. @entity107 , for voting against a pandemic preparedeness bill			2
( @entity107 actually voted for the final version of the bill			0
) sen. @entity172 , a @entity174 @entity173 , said monday on @entity1 the public health system needs more resources to confront @entity5 and that @entity65 should have never cut public health funding over the last several years			2
" especially when it comes to public health , sequestration is a bad idea and should be repealed , " @entity172 said			0
" @entity65 has to take responsibility for a program that needs a lot more funding			0
" @entity57 senator ca n't judge @entity188 's @entity5 handling @entity65 will debate and vote on the budget for the next fiscal year in the coming weeks , which @entity172 called " an opportunity in the @entity65 to get this right			2
" he is calling for adding at least $ 120 million to the public health budget			0
rep. @entity196 , a @entity173 from @entity197 , also linked spending cuts and the @entity5 outbreak in an interview with @entity1 on thursday			1
" there 's no doubt the deep health care cuts that we 've seen have made it more difficult to respond in a rapid and comprehensive way to the @entity5 outbreak , " @entity196 said			1
" the cuts they 've seen in past years , they were like eroding the foundation and it clearly meant that they were starting from behind , " and @entity215 , director of the @entity22 's @entity216 of @entity217 , said during a recent congressional hearing that spending cuts have had " a significant impact on us " that has " eroded our ability to respond in the way that i and my colleagues would like to see us be able to respond to these emerging threats			0
