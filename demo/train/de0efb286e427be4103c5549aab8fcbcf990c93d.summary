-- @entity2 has uncovered a file that could link @entity4 , the highly visible renegade hacker group , to a breach that led to the theft of personal information for as many as 101 million people , the company wrote in a letter to the @entity11			1
during the investigations , which have gone on for two weeks so far with many online networks offline , @entity2 discovered a file on its system named @entity4 that contained the group 's sort of catchphrase , " we are @entity19 , " wrote @entity20 , the @entity21 president and @entity23 division chairman			1
the file was found on a server managed by @entity26 , a subsidiary that makes online multiplayer games for the computer and @entity29			1
@entity26 originally thought it was unaffected by the intrusions that hit sister companies , but investigators found that its data , too , was taken during the two - day attack last month			2
@entity26 , which sells subscription - based games such as " @entity37 " and " @entity38 , " took its systems offline monday morning at 4:38 a.m. et and disclosed the intrusion later that day , a spokeswoman said			2
the @entity4 file was discovered on sunday , after @entity2 found that data had been taken from @entity26 's servers , but she declined to say why the company did n't initially mention the file			1
@entity4 has gained international notoriety over the last several years for its computer - security attacks on major companies			2
the group has gone after @entity50 , @entity51 , the @entity52 and government websites for @entity54 and @entity55			0
many of the targets are chosen for political or philosophical reasons			0
@entity2 found itself in @entity4 ' crosshairs early last month in retaliation for suing two people who were distributing instructions showing how to hack a @entity29 game system			1
@entity20 said in his letter that @entity4 members collaborated to overload @entity2 's servers , a practice of constantly pinging a web address called a denial of service attack			1
" you have abused the judicial system in an attempt to censor information on how your products work , " a representative for the group wrote in a public letter to @entity2 posted on its website			2
" in doing so you have violated the privacy of thousands of innocent people who only sought the free distribution of information			0
" now @entity2 is suggesting @entity4 helped facilitate the theft of millions of people 's private data			1
" this cyberattack came shortly after @entity21 was the subject of denial of service attacks launched against several @entity2 companies and threats made against both @entity2 and its executives , " @entity20 wrote in the response to a congressional inquiry			0
" whether those who participated in the denial of service attacks were conspirators or whether they were simply duped into providing cover for a very clever thief , we may never know			0
" @entity4 posted an update to its website after @entity2 shut down its @entity101 and @entity102 media streaming service , titled " for once we did n't do it			1
" the statement read : " while it could be the case that other @entity105 have acted by themselves @entity106 ( sic ) not related to this incident and takes no responsiblity ( sic ) for it			0
" @entity2 says it is working with the @entity109 and security experts to analyze the situation			0
they have n't yet identified the people responsible for the breach , @entity20 wrote .			0

@entity2 says it found a file linking the @entity4 hacker group to a recent attack
the file , containing the group 's sort of calling card , was *allegedly* left on @entity2 's server
@entity4 denies *involvement* with the intrusion that *resulted* in @entity2 going offline
