@entity0 -- @entity3 nominee @entity2 received critical cover from moderate @entity5 on thursday on two issues likely to dominate her upcoming confirmation hearings : gays in the military and judicial experience			1
@entity2 has been strongly criticized by @entity12 leaders for her efforts to block military recruiters from @entity15 during her time as the school 's law school dean because of the military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy			1
the policy , opposed by president @entity22 , prevents gays and lesbians from serving openly in the armed forces			0
@entity26 have also highlighted the fact that @entity2 has never served as a federal judge , something that distinguishes her from all nine current members of the high court			1
if party moderates break from the @entity12 leadership on these issues , it dramatically increases @entity2 's chances of overcoming a possible filibuster and winning confirmation as the country 's 112th @entity3 justice			1
@entity12 sen. @entity41 -- who broke the @entity43 ' 60 - member filibuster - proof majority by winning the late @entity45 's seat in january -- said after meeting with @entity2 that he is satisfied she supports members of the military			1
" it was the first question i actually asked her because , having been in the military , i had concerns about [ her ] position at @entity15 , " @entity41 said			2
" it was very clear to me , after we spoke about it at length , that she is supportive of the men and women who are fighting to protect us and very supportive of the military as a whole			0
i do not feel that her judicial philosophy will hurt the men and women who are serving			0
" while dean at @entity66 , @entity2 said she " abhorred " the military 's " discriminatory recruitment policy			1
" she called it " a profound wrong -- a moral injustice of the first order			0
" @entity2 supported other schools ' challenges to a federal law requiring that recruiters be given equal access or face the loss of federal funding			2
the @entity3 unanimously upheld the law in 2006			2
earlier in the day , @entity81 sen. @entity80 said she does n't have any concerns about @entity2 's experience			1
she also said she did n't see any " extraordinary circumstances " that could lead her to join a potential filibuster against @entity2			2
@entity86 said that @entity2 told her she considers @entity87 , the 1973 ruling establishing a constitutional right to abortion , to be settled law			2
kagan herself has remained tight - lipped when asked such questions from reporters			0
the support of @entity41 and @entity86 alone , combined with a unified @entity96 caucus , would be enough to ensure @entity2 's confirmation			1
in addition to meeting with @entity41 and @entity86 on thursday , @entity2 stopped by the offices of five key @entity43 : @entity101 ' @entity100 , @entity103 's @entity102 , @entity105 's @entity104 , @entity107 's @entity106 and @entity109 's @entity108			1
@entity108 said @entity2 may be open to the idea of allowing television coverage of @entity3 hearings			1
" she said it 'd be helpful to the public and to the court , " he said			0
" this was the best answer i 've gotten " from any recent @entity3 candidate			2
@entity108 is a staunch advocate of allowing television cameras into the high court			0
most justices , however , have adamantly opposed the idea			0
@entity108 also said @entity2 stood by comments she made in 1995 , when she dismissed the confirmation hearing process as a " charade			2
" @entity2 's meeting with @entity108 attracted considerable attention because of his political troubles			1
@entity108 -- who is facing a tough primary fight next week -- voted against @entity2 for solicitor general before switching from the @entity5 to the @entity96			0
@entity108 has not said how he will vote on her @entity3 nomination			0
some political observers have speculated that his previous opposition to @entity2 , combined with an unwillingness to immediately back her now , could undercut his support with stalwart @entity43			1
a quick declaration in favor of @entity2 , on the other hand , could strike some voters as political opportunism			0
@entity2 kicked off her @entity142 meetings on wednesday , visiting senate majority leader @entity143 , @entity144 , and @entity146 minority leader @entity145 , @entity147			1
she also met with @entity149 chairman @entity148 , @entity150 , and sen. @entity151 of @entity152 , the committee 's top @entity5			0
@entity22 nominated @entity2 on monday to replace retiring @entity3 @entity154			1
if confirmed , she would become the third woman on the current nine - member bench and the fourth woman in the court 's history			0
@entity1 's @entity161 and @entity162 contributed to this report .			0

@entity12 sens. @entity41 and @entity80 back @entity2 on key issues
