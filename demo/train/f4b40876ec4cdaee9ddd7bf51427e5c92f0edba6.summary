all his years of military training and combat experience could n't prepare him for what happened a few weeks ago			2
in mid-october , @entity2 received a call from his father , who told him police might have found @entity4 locked in a dank @entity0 basement with three other people			1
the pitch - black , 15 - by - 6 - foot space discovered by the owner of the apartment building houses what police described as an abandoned boiler room , where the overwhelming stench of urine and feces still hung in the chamber two days after the discovery			0
hours after his father 's phone call , @entity2 made the nine - hour drive north to see if his long - lost brother was among the four victims			1
" it made me nauseous			0
it was eating me up			0
i was crying on the way up there			0
if that gut feeling was n't there , i would n't have gone , " he said			2

exhausted and feeling defeated , he began to cry , fearing his brother no longer even recognized him , he said			2
but as if on cue , @entity4 stood up and walked over to the stunned men and said , " pop , " to his father			2
@entity2 , a self - described tough guy who completed two tours in @entity122 , wept uncontrollably			2
i realized how much i missed him , how much i loved him , " he said			0
" he looked really , really skinny and really malnourished			0
" then @entity4 started looking closer at his crying brother and said , " @entity2 ? " he quickly flashed @entity4 his military @entity125			1
@entity4 held it inches from his face , almost straining to read it , @entity2 said			1
@entity4 started talking , and then wrapped his lanky arms around his baby brother			1

" then he said , ' you know what i want ? i want a cheesesteak			0
' so i went and got him one as fast as i could			0
