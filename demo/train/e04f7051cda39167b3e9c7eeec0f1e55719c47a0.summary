over the last 20 years , the narrative on the @entity2 continent has shifted from afro - pessimism to afro - optimism			1
the truth lies somewhere in between			0
now is the time for @entity8 - realism : for sound policies based on honest data , aimed at delivering results			2
the potential of our continent is huge			1
compared to developed countries , or even to some major emerging countries , burdened by aging populations , financial crises , widening budget deficits , faltering faith in politics and growing social demands , @entity2 has become the world 's last " @entity23 " , a kind of " it - continent "			1
by the end of this century , half of the world 's young people will be @entity2			1
twenty years from now , by 2035 , @entity2 's working age population will exceed that of @entity33 or @entity34			1
youth is our major resource			0
but our continent also harbors most of the world 's proven mineral reserves : 95 % of platinum , over 75 % of phosphate , 60 % of diamonds , nearly half of cobalt and chromium , more than a quarter of bauxite			2
diamonds aside , 90 % of this huge potential remains untapped			2
in a world of growing food demand , @entity2 is home to two - thirds of the world 's unexploited arable land			1
its solar , water , wind and nuclear energy potential are considerable			0
already , over the last 10 years , @entity2 's overall gdp growth has reached an annual average of 5.4 % ; more than four times the @entity60 average			1
in 2012 , 16 @entity2 countries experienced gdp growth in excess of 5 %			1
the latest iteration of the @entity65 shows that 94 % of the population of the continent is now living in a country where the overall level of governance has improved since 2000			0
all of this is promising -- but we are still a long way from realizing our potential			1
let us first stop talking about " @entity2 " as a homogeneous and uniform whole			1
we are a mosaic of 54 countries , each with its own flag , its own borders , and its own embassies			0
the @entity83 , whose 50th anniversary we have just celebrated , is still a long way from @entity87 - style @entity60 , with its common market , single currency , supra - national political bodies and common and shared budget			1
and the road to convergence between the 54 countries is a long one			0
without effective economic and political regional integration , we will not carry sufficient weight in this globalized world , no matter how much " potential " we may have			1
only unity , coherence , and internal solidarity will allow us to assert ourselves on the global stage			0
the building blocks to effective integration are not political declarations , expansive @entity104 or our presence and commitments at impressive multilateral gatherings			1
the building blocks are the free movement of people , goods and financial resources between our countries			0
this is the way @entity87 was built			0
as we approach @entity2 with an @entity8 - realist view , the progress made over the past decade must be understood in a nuanced fashion			1
the major regional conflicts of the former century have mostly ended			0
however , the dawn of the new century has also seen a rise in social tension , domestic unrest , and trans - national problems			1
terrorist networks have gained geographical ground and widened their operating sectors , often in direct association with large , cross-border criminal networks			0
young people are becoming the demographic majority			0
they are receiving better education than their elders			0
but they are also more unemployed and out of step with the demands of the global labor market			0
they are also feeling increasingly disconnected from the political process and devoid of economic prospects -- a trend reflected in the rise in the trafficking and consumption of drugs on the continent			1
impressive economic growth is taking place all over the continent			2
however this coincides with a worrying rise in inequality , which deepens the divisions between countries and within them			0
@entity2 has a vast reservoir of natural resources			2
but to leverage this , and guarantee ownership of the @entity2 citizens , much remains to be done : ensuring transparency of contracts , creating local jobs , upgrading the value chain and redistributing wealth			2
today , 90 % of @entity165 's oil is still being exported from the continent , while just 25 % of the @entity168 population has access to electricity			0
we must focus less on international support and more on @entity2 unity			2
while the @entity174 was important for @entity87 's recovery , @entity87 's prosperity was really built on economic integration and policy coherence			2
moving from international aid to foreign investment is progress , but it is not enough			0
we must move towards increasing continental investments on the continent			0
we must prioritize regional integration ; the reduction of inequality between and within countries ; the employment of our young people and the governance of our natural resources			1
our continent has secured its political independence			2
it is time now to build our autonomy			0

@entity204 says @entity2 has become a kind of " it - continent "
however , @entity2 is still a long way from realizing its potential
recently there has been a rise in social tension , domestic unrest , and *transnational* issues
he calls for effective economic and political regional integration
