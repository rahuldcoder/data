-- ambitious plans for a " city in the city " skyscraper that could house apartments , offices , shops and parks have been revealed			1
the award - winning proposal " @entity13 " drawn up by @entity12 based firm @entity11 could see a tower of up to 300 meters being built in @entity15			1
" we tried to design a city rather than a high rise building , " @entity11 's global director and chief architect @entity16 told @entity0			1
the proposed tower , which won the @entity21 2014 , has two continuous ramps or " streets " running the entire length of the building , lined with shops , apartments , parks and museums			1
designed to replicate a dna structure , designers hope the tower will " increase exchanges , communications and interactions " and offer views across @entity15			1
they also hope to create eye - catching internal vistas by including a series of plazas with " individual character " throughout the tower			2
inside the tower , " there is no limit ... you can walk in the same way you can walk around a city , " @entity11 's @entity42 said			2
the ramps are designed to widen near the top of the building , enabling natural light and ventilation to filter down and save on energy costs			2
it is also structured to collect and recycle rain water			0
the building would be supported by six steel tubes , hiding the building 's electrical wiring and plumbing			0
according to the plan , the tower could rise as high as @entity15 's tallest tower , the @entity65 , or @entity67 's @entity66			1
the architects have identified a site for the proposal , but are yet to start any application process			0
@entity16 hopes the project will encourage people to think about vertical designs that would , in the future , bring the feeling of a city inside a building			0
" ' @entity13 ' is also about continuity between the pattern , the street level and the building			0
right now , buildings have a big distinction between street level and the space inside the building , " @entity42 said			0
