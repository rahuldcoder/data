the increased number of @entity4 airstrikes against @entity5 in the @entity7 city of @entity8 reflects more targets of opportunity , not a change in the campaign against the vicious @entity14 group , a @entity1 spokesman said thursday			1
the strikes are helping @entity17 fighters on the ground push back @entity5 militants in the @entity7 town , according to sources there			1
" there 's been no strategic shift here , as far as i know , at least from the military perspective , about @entity8 or any other town , " rear adm. @entity23 said , making a unique appearance at the @entity26 's daily briefing			2
in recent weeks , administration and @entity4 defense officials have said it was n't essential to keep the city , not far from the border with @entity36 , from becoming the latest in @entity7 to fall into @entity5 hands			1
" we never said @entity8 did n't matter , " @entity23 said			2
" what makes @entity8 matter for us from an airstrike perspective is that ( @entity5 is ) there , and that they want it			2
" @entity23 said the number of airstrikes in @entity7 or @entity45 depends on how " target rich " an area is			2
the past few days around @entity8 have seen more @entity5 targets , he said			2
there are more isis fights there with more force , @entity23 said			0
@entity4 fighter jets conducted at least 14 raids near @entity8 on wednesday and thursday , according to @entity54			1
initial reports show the strikes hit 19 @entity5 buildings and 10 other targets , including command posts , sniper positions and a staging location , the @entity4 military said			1
according to @entity65 's math , that makes 122 strikes on the city , most of any town in what the military recently labeled @entity70			0
street by street the battle for @entity8 has become a street fight over control of hills and neighborhoods and witnessed by tv cameras pointed there from @entity36			0
these strikes on small targets in @entity8 , such as sniper positions , are " tactical " in nature -- without the widespread " strategic " affect against @entity5 that @entity4 officials have said is the foundation for the @entity4 operation in @entity7 , a senior @entity4 military official told @entity65 's @entity87			1
" it 's not ' whack - a - mole , ' " @entity23 said			0
" the idea is n't to just put a warhead on a forehead every single day			0
the idea is to try to get at their ability to sustain themselves and to disrupt their strategy			0
" one @entity17 fighter told @entity65 thursday that @entity5 has been forced from many parts of the city , but still controls some key buildings including the hospital and the important @entity105 building in the middle of @entity8 , which served as headquarters for the @entity109 , or @entity110			1
@entity17 forces have control of the southwest entrance of the city and have taken some buildings back from @entity5 fighters in one neighborhood , next to the heavily contested eastern industrial area of the city			1
the airstrikes over the past few days have helped @entity17 @entity110 fighters turn into an offensive rather than a defensive force , one activist said			1
but , he adds , " there is still street fighting in the east and in the south " of @entity8			0
" this is an infantry battle now and traditional reconnaissance does not work , " said @entity127 with the @entity128			0
it 's hard to get correct information , making the results of the airstrikes indecisive , he said			0
a @entity1 officials told @entity65 that good weather played a role in the @entity8 airstrikes , because the targets were readily located by overhead surveillance			1
in @entity45 on the other hand , bad weather has forced a slowdown in strikes , the official said			0
@entity147 chairman : ' i do n't see ' @entity149 falling @entity5 pushing ahead in @entity45 ? militants have tightened their grip over an area about 15 miles south of @entity155 , an @entity151 province official said thursday			1
@entity5 has brought many of its fighters , armed with heavy weaponry and machinery , in order to attack and control the town of @entity163 , the head of the town 's council , @entity164 , said thusday			2
@entity164 urged the @entity45 government to send military reinforcements to support the security forces inside the town			0
@entity171 on @entity5 : expect ' long - term campaign ' @entity5 advances have slowed and the group has changed formation , communication and tactics making them " harder to hit , " @entity23 said			0
he called for " strategic patience " in measuring the success of the operation			0
militants continue to surround a major airbase in the @entity45 's @entity151 province and @entity4 officials say they 're continuing airstrikes there to help @entity45 forces			1
" in @entity151 province , our hope is to stop or halt that tactical initiative and momentum that they ( @entity5 ) have , " gen. @entity187 , the special presidential envoy on @entity5 , said wednesday			1
it is clear that @entity5 " has made substantial gains in @entity45 , " he said			2
a senior @entity4 military official told @entity65 the fight in @entity151 is " very tough , " but " @entity45 forces are holding their own in some places			1
" @entity4 officials do not see the @entity201 military base in @entity151 on the verge of being overrun by @entity5 , the official said			1
opinion : why we must talk to the bad guys --- even @entity5 @entity5 car bomb in @entity149 at least five people were killed and 15 were injured when two car bombs exploded in the @entity210 neighborhood in @entity149 thursday , according to police			0
