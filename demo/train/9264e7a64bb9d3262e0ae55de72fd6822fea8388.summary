@entity0 -- no blood was spilled			0
but otherwise , a packed @entity4 hearing room tuesday watched the political equivalent of a heavyweight fight			1
@entity4 democrat @entity7 sat just feet from rival @entity9 leader @entity8 for a rhetorical battle royal over campaign finance and @entity7 's push to change the @entity13 to limit that spending			1
" the @entity13 does n't give corporations a vote , and it does n't give dollar bills a vote , " said @entity7			1
the @entity19 @entity7 is pushing for a constitutional amendment to override the @entity22 's 2010 " @entity23 " decision and allow @entity24 to set firm limits on independent and corporate campaign spending in federal elections			1
the proposal , sponsored by @entity30 sens. @entity29 of @entity31 and @entity32 of @entity33 , would also allow states to set more campaign limits in their elections			2
the @entity38 hearing set up a rare side - by - side appearance by @entity7 and @entity40 , two powerful leaders who are known for their sometimes bitter disagreements over process and policy in the @entity4			1
the effect was electric as the hearing started			2
hundreds of seated spectators craned their necks to see both men			0
as @entity40 looked straight ahead at the panel of senators , @entity7 swung			1
" campaign finance reform has been proposed a number of times before -- even by my counterpart , senator @entity40 , " @entity7 said			1
the @entity30 leader pointed to the @entity9 's 1988 proposal that would have restricted some pac and so - called " soft - money " contributions made to organizations			1
@entity40 's office has said that the proposal was an alternative to a much more limiting campaign finance bill and insists he has not voted for any funding restrictions since			2
but @entity7 kept at it			1
" senator @entity40 had the right idea ( in 1988 ) , " he offered			0
the @entity19 senator also employed his signature move in the debate , blasting conservative billionaires @entity73 and @entity75 , saying the brothers run 15 " phantom " or " phony " campaign funding organizations			2
who are the @entity75 brothers ? @entity40 waited his turn			0
@entity7 finished but then surprised some in the room , indicating he would not stay to hear @entity40 's response			1
@entity7 's office later told @entity1 that he had to give remarks at a meeting about mental health and suicide prevention			1
as he moved to leave , @entity7 joked that his @entity9 counterpart likely would not be upset by his departure			1
" @entity92 , no problem , " @entity40 deadpanned			0
to scattered laughter , @entity7 exited			1
then , the @entity9 punched back			1
" given how incredibly bad this amendment is , i ca n't blame my friend , the majority leader , from wanting to talk about the @entity97 or what i may have said over a quarter century ago , " @entity40 said			0
the @entity99 @entity9 jabbed at the proposal to give @entity24 control of campaign limits			1
he called it a threat to basic speech rights and then got to the basic disagreement of the debate : whether limiting campaign dollars is also limiting speech			2
@entity22 allows more private money in election campaigns by setting spending rates , @entity40 argued , @entity24 would choose who gets how much influence in politics			2
" not only would ( this proposal ) allow the government to favor some speakers over others , it would guarantee preferential treatment , " @entity40 argued			0
other senators in the hearing soon rang in , exchanging quotes from the founding fathers and debating which political party was truly protecting free speech			1
" this amendment is about power and it is about silencing citizens , " boomed sen. @entity128 , a @entity9 of @entity129			1
" when did the ( @entity30 ) abandon the @entity134 ? ... this would give @entity24 the power to ban books and muzzle movies			0
" members of the group @entity140 , which opposes the " @entity23 " ruling that removed legal barriers preventing corporations and unions from spending unlimited sums on federal elections , laughed mockingly as @entity128 spoke			2
a few rows ahead , some others shot them stern looks			0
2014 @entity150 : what 's at stake @entity153 sen. @entity153 responded directly to @entity128 ' strike at @entity30			0
" i think if @entity156 were looking down at what 's being proposed here , he would agree with it , " @entity153 said			0
the @entity160 noted that the @entity22 has upheld some limits on speech , including restrictions on things like child pornography			0
he directly challenged the @entity129 tea party favorite			0
" i want to ask you sen. @entity128 - are you against anti-child pornography laws ? " @entity153 asked			0
at the time , @entity128 was gone , voting on the @entity4 floor			1
when he returned , he was not pleased			0
" i understand that in my absence sen. @entity153 very kindly gave a lecture on civility and encouraged me not to go over the top , while he then in the same breath accused me of supporting child pornography , " @entity128 told the committee sarcastically			0
" so i appreciate that demonstration in senatorial restraint from the senior senator from @entity184			0
" the hearing was both a serious , powerful debate and an exercise in the tricky personal and political barbs that now litter the @entity4			1
attendance alone indicated the high stakes and interest in the topic -- with a long hallway full of people being sent to an overflow room to watch the hearing from the building next door			2
the subject has keen advantages to both political sides , both use it to stoke their bases			0
but while the hearing may have been high - interest , @entity40 ultimately raised the bottom - line question : where will this constitutional amendment push end up ? " everybody on this committee knows this proposal is never going to pass @entity24			0
this is a political exercise and that 's all this is , " @entity40 told the committee			2
@entity30 insist they will fight for the change , but there is no vote scheduled yet on the proposal and it is not clear when there could be one			0
