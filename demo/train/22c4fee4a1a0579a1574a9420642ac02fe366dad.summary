is the luxury of multiple years and seasons to explore different moments and experiences in a character 's life as they naturally progress			1
because of that , tv shows frequently evolve drastically from their tidy season 1 concepts , which can make their original titles a bit confusing			1
with some minor spoilers ahead , here are six tv shows that might have benefited from a name change during their runs : veep when the @entity23 comedy premiered back in 2012 , " @entity21 " was the perfect fit for @entity26 ' vice president @entity25 dealing with a life in politics and the politics of life			1
the show is fictional , but " @entity21 " still follows the general rules of @entity34 government , so it was natural to assume that @entity25 would seek her boss ' job at some point , and season 3â € ²s plot on the campaign trail foreshadowed such a change			1
then came the two - part finale , when @entity25 was actually appointed president as the current commander in chief resigned to take care of his sick wife			1
like another tv vp , " @entity57 ' " @entity47 ( @entity48 ) , @entity25 becomes president without a single vote cast for her ( which looked like the only way she was gon na become president anyway after losing primaries in @entity55 and @entity56 )			1
but now that she 's not the " @entity21 , " should the show still have the same name ? alternative title : peep glee " open delight or pleasure ; exultant joy ; exultation " â € ” that 's how the dictionary defines " glee , " but the @entity74 musical series was more referring to the high school glee club joined by a bunch of reject teens in @entity66 in season 1			1
now that @entity75 is a household name , so is the idea of actually joining a school singing group			2
for the record , i was the veep ( callback ! ) of my high school 's glee club before the show was on the air and before anyone really knew what a glee club was ; most schools just refer to them as choirs			1
and although the @entity93 were really a show choir and not a glee club , the idea that singing gives you open delight or pleasure still resonated in the title			1
but halfway through the fifth season , the show moved completely out of @entity66 to @entity102 to further follow the young characters once they got outside the choir room			2
oh , and after years of threats and attempts , @entity105 disbanded the glee club before they left the @entity109 for good			1
i 'm sure that playing @entity112 on @entity113 and having a tv show written about your too - good - to - be - true life ( ' cause it is a tv show ) would bring me exultant joy , but @entity118 ai n't in the glee club anymore			1
well , actually , no one is			2
and if the show wants to show what it really means to be a struggling young actor without a college education in the @entity126 , it needs to get a little dark			2
alternative title : gloom @entity130 though better than " the @entity136 that did n't suck , " the title of the @entity132 ( and later @entity134 ) sitcom was a little misleading			1
the show takes place in a fictional @entity140 town nicknamed " @entity130 " because of the high school mascot , but the show is n't about the whole town ; it 's about @entity145 's character @entity146 , single mother exploring the truths about dating and aging after just getting a divorce			1
the title was justified in the first season with a relationship with a younger man played by @entity154 , but by season 3 , @entity146 was engaged and then married to a man her own age			2
by that point , the concept of the show was quite different than the pilot , and the creators actually did try and change the name multiple times			2
options like @entity140 , @entity165 , @entity166 , the @entity140 , and @entity167 all sounded too much like other properties , and a @entity170 contest was even launched before season 3 for fan submissions			2
at least the producers had a sense of humor , though , with the subtitle " not happy about it " running in promos and the opening sequence , referring to their frustration with the lack of action on the network 's part			2
the show will return for a sixth and final season sometime in 2015 on @entity134 , and it 's still called @entity130			2
alternative title : @entity187 with a @entity188 @entity189 , 90210 after the show premiered in 1990 , what quickly became the most popular zip code in @entity34 was actually one of five zip codes that makes up @entity189 , @entity195 , and the creators of the show were quick to defend the numerical sequence that was making them much larger numerical sequences at the bank			1
the show takes place in the fictitious @entity202 , not because the real @entity203 would n't allow it , but because the school is actually located in 90212			1
later on in the series when the group attends ( the , again , fictitious ) @entity208 , the exact location is left up to the imagination of the viewer , but most would assume it also fit the same code			1
@entity208 was really filmed on the campus of @entity213 in @entity214 , @entity195 , a.k.a. 90041			0
and who could forget the beach apartment that @entity217 and @entity218 shared in later seasons ? for those unfamiliar with @entity195 geography , @entity189 is not near the beach at all			0
that all took place in @entity225 , 90254			0
alternative title : @entity189 , @entity227 family matters ask anyone on the street if they know " @entity228 , " and you might get mixed responses			0
ask anyone on the street if they know who @entity237 is , and whoa , mama , you 'll probably get a more positive reaction			0
" @entity228 " began as a family sitcom centered on matriarch @entity242 , with @entity243 reprising her role from " @entity245 " for the spin - off			0
however , halfway through the first season , the family 's neighbor @entity237 was introduced as a love interest for daughter @entity251 and not only took over the show , but pretty much all of pop culture at the moment			0
the show ran for nine seasons and more than 200 episodes , eventually introducing @entity237 's suave alter - ego @entity257 and his female cousin @entity259 , also played by @entity260			0
alternative title : only @entity262 two and a @entity263 the @entity265 sitcom has seen its fair share of ups and downs over the years			0
at one point , it was nominated for multiple emmys while bringing in millions of viewers each week , but it will probably end up being more remembered for the controversial cast shakeups			0
as the title suggests , the show was about two men ( @entity277 and @entity278 ) and the young son ( half man ) of @entity278 's character , played by @entity281			0
after eight seasons , @entity277 went all # winning on everyone and left the show , having his character killed in the premiere of the ninth season , and was later replaced by @entity287 ( still a man )			0
after @entity277 left , @entity281 went all religious on everyone in 2012 and called the show " filth that contradicts my moral values			0
" after some contract negotiations and a brief recurring status , @entity281 officially left the show at the end of season 10 and was replaced by @entity296 ( not a full or half man ) as the long - lost lesbian daughter of @entity277 's character			0
since the show has lost one and a half of those two and a half men , it would seem an update would make sense			0

" @entity21 " does n't really fit anymore
" @entity315 " is hardly about a glee club anymore
" 90210 " was actually a different location
