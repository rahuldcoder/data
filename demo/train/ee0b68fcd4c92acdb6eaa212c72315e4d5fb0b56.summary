-- pop - cultural suburbia : take your pick			1
for some , the promised land			2
for others , a worm - infested dullsville			1
why such a divide ? perhaps it 's the natural reaction to disillusionment , says @entity22 pop culture professor @entity21			1
the suburb " was touted as the perfect way to package @entity25 life in the utopian era that we expected the end of @entity29 to bring us , " he says			1
" we 're in the @entity32			2
air conditioning and dishwashers and all of this stuff			0
the suburbs stood for the place where this perfect kind of life was going to be lived			1
" the suburb was n't a new concept ; people had been attempting to push their way out of crowded cities for as long as there had been crowded cities , and rail service and streetcars made it possible to build communities on city outskirts			0
" streetcar suburbs , " such as @entity55 's @entity54 , @entity57 's @entity56 and @entity59 's @entity58 , started sprouting in the 19th century			0
but it was the automobile , with its promise of personal mobility , that fostered a suburban boom			1
the most popular exhibit at the 1939 @entity65 was @entity66 -- sponsored by @entity67 -- which posited a future of superhighways leading consumers through muscular cities and bucolic towns			0
" i have seen @entity75 , " read the souvenir buttons			0
@entity0 photos : @entity78 ' ' suburbia ' captured the @entity79 the future originally looked something like the past			1
tired of six - story walkups ? in the suburbs you could have your own picket - fenced home , just like the ones in small towns of yore			1
sick of the subway ? in the suburbs you could ride the comfortable commuter train -- or , even better , travel to work on a speedy expressway in your very own car			0
television was the best mirror of this optimistic age			0
@entity99 's @entity98 ( " @entity100 " ) , @entity102 's @entity101 ( " @entity104 , " less biting than the radio version ) and @entity106 ( " the @entity103 " ) all lived in crime - free municipalities urban enough to have the latest appliances ( like , well , a television ) but removed enough that their kids could play and bike without those crowded city worries -- like traffic , ethnic groups and the poor			1
in this period , it was writers who poked holes in suburban perfection			1
@entity124 , with his quietly desperate @entity122 escapees , was the master of suburban dissatisfaction , but others -- novelist @entity127 ( " @entity130 " ) and journalist @entity128 ( " @entity129 " ) among them -- took aim at the consumerist society entwined with suburbia			1
on tv , only " @entity136 's " @entity134 -- at heart , a writer -- seemed to agree with them			1
eventually their views took over			0
if the cities were rotten -- just check out early ' 70s films such as " @entity143 " and " @entity144 " for a taste of the chipping paint -- the suburbs were soulless , cookie - cutter places inhabited by people with secrets			2
@entity150 , which is often depicted as one big suburb , was the center of this emptiness ( it does n't hurt that the region 's chief industry is fantasy ) , but it 's an image that transfers anywhere , from @entity159 ( " @entity160 " ) to @entity161 ( " @entity161 " )			0
indeed , horror movies such as " nightmare , " " @entity164 " and " @entity165 " found plenty to work with in the suburbs			2
these days , the pop culture divide still holds			1
to some -- @entity169 comes to mind -- the city , for all its faults , is vibrant and lively , and the suburbs are " @entity175 " dead ends			0
to others , particularly television producers , it 's the suburbs -- where most of us live , after all -- where real life happens , and the city is something for the wealthy , the terminally hip , the criminals and the tourists			2
@entity185 : what makes your suburb unique ? the truth , of course , is neither here nor there			0
today 's suburbs are increasingly multicultural and , in some cases , have developed their own skyscraper - filled " edge cities , " in the term popularized by journalist @entity196			2
accurately portraying such a complex environment is as difficult as accurately portraying the people who live there -- though there are some ( author @entity203 , " @entity206 " producers @entity204 and @entity207 ) who try			0
in the end , suburbia is what our imagination wants it to be , and it wo n't quite fit into those little boxes of ticky - tacky			1
" we know that inside each one of those identical boxes , with its @entity216 parked out front , and its white bread on the table , and its tv set glowing blue in the falling dusk , there were people with stories , " concluded the pilot of " @entity227			2
" " there were families bound together in the pain and the struggle of love			0
there were moments that made us cry with laughter			0
and there were moments ... of sorrow and wonder			0

pop - culture depiction of suburbia is divided : @entity243 or hell
in years *shortly* after @entity29 , suburbia was presented as utopia
in recent decades , *attitude* has often gone the other way
tv usually *favors* suburban life ; books and movies show *negatives*
