-- there is not a single day i do n't think about them			2
exactly two months ago , over 200 schoolgirls were abducted in @entity5 , @entity6			1
today , they are still missing			0
and i feel as outraged as many of you do			0
as the world hopes for their safe return , there is another story			0
what does n't make the headlines is the fact that many children around the world have never had a chance to go to school			1
in @entity22 and @entity23 , almost 1 out of 5 school - age children will never enter a classroom , according to a new report by @entity26 and the @entity27			1
globally , more than 57 million primary school - age children do not attend classes			1
over half of them live in @entity32			0
what keeps so many children excluded from school across the continent ? what prevents so many children from seeing a classroom , given that " free education " became a reality in various countries in @entity32 , including my home country , @entity44 ? one report finds that girls from poor families living in rural areas have significantly less opportunities to go to school			1
in addition , conflicts and natural disasters can cause extensive damages and disrupt schooling -- sometimes for weeks , sometimes for years			0
while the abolishment of school fees has led to a sharp increase in the number of children enrolled in schools , in many countries " free education " is never entirely free			1
supplies , books and other indirect costs can easily make access to school unaffordable			2
getting out - of - school children into school is more than just building more classrooms and deploying more teachers			2
in order to reduce the number of children excluded from the education system , @entity73 governments must commit to the idea of bringing girls back to school			1
even when all the barriers to access are lifted , the quality of the learning taking place in the classroom remains an issue			0
those who enter school often drop out without acquiring adequate skills and never complete primary or lower secondary school			0
high repetition rates lead to large proportions of adolescents who are held back in education systems that are inappropriate for their age			2
everyone wins when children -- and especially girls -- have access to education			1
an educated girl is likely to increase her personal earning potential and prepare herself for a productive and fulfilling life , as well as reduce poverty in the whole community			0
investing in girls ' education also helps delay early marriage and parenthood			2
our booming economies in @entity23 need more female engineers , teachers and doctors to prosper and sustain growth			0
throughout @entity23 , i visited a lot of schools where @entity26 and its partners are working to get every child , especially girls and other marginalized groups , into classrooms			0
i saw firsthand how simple programs , such as scholarships , mentoring , a second chance to education and the provision of sanitary pads , can make a difference in the lives of girls			1
as i watched @entity73 schoolgirls on their way to school , i wondered where i would be today if i had n't had the opportunity to access education when i was a child			1
would i be able to write this piece if my parents had n't made all the needed sacrifice to let me learn , grow and strive ? probably not			0
most of us take access to school for granted			0
for many children in @entity23 , it 's still a luxury , perhaps the most indispensable yet reachable luxury for @entity6 and the whole continent .			1
