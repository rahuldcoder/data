@entity12 president @entity33 recently announced the withdrawal of 33,000 @entity12 troops by the end of next year			0
@entity37 announced that it would also begin to reduce troop numbers , saying it " will initiate a progressive withdrawal of troops in @entity3 , and will follow a timetable comparable to the withdrawal of the @entity12 troops			1
" one of more than 40 countries participating in @entity21 's @entity46 with nearly 3,000 troops , @entity1 has lost more than 157 troops in the war , the third highest death toll after the @entity12 and @entity51			1
the grinding conflict has been frustrating for many @entity1 citizens , frustrated by the mission 's casualties			2
prime minister @entity56 planned an end to the combat mission three years ago			0
also , the government says , the " incremental cost of the current mission in @entity3 to the @entity61 from 2001 to 2011 is currently estimated to be approximately $ 11.3 billion			0
" " through their operations there to cut off terror at its root , our men and women in uniform have made an enormous contribution to @entity1 security abroad , " said @entity56 , in his reaction to the killing in may of @entity66 leader @entity65			0

also , the government said , 45 members of civilian police forces will help mentor the @entity103 and the @entity104			0
" what 's interesting about this is the direction we kind of laid out in 2008 is actually now where @entity21 as a whole has gone , and everybody now is increasingly moving towards 2014 , to moving towards training missions , giving the @entity3 greater responsibility for their own security , " @entity56 said in an interview with @entity1 's @entity107 newspaper last month			1
" we will remain engaged on development and on diplomacy and on particular humanitarian issues , particularly the rights of women and children , education , these kinds of priorities			0
