-- curled up on a couch in @entity3 , clad in a white tank top and black track pants , @entity1 is ready to get personal			1
after nearly four decades in the spotlight -- from her debut on the classic tv sitcom " @entity9 " to musical mega-stardom to roles in such acclaimed films as the new @entity14 drama , " @entity16 " -- the youngest @entity1 sibling , 44 , is feeling more comfortable than ever in her own skin			1
here , the sweet , soft - spoken legend -- who released a cd of her number - one hits , " icon , " in august and has a book coming out next month -- gets real about the pressures in @entity24 , working out , and what makes her happy now			1
q : we 're really excited about your upcoming book , " @entity33 , " which covers self - esteem and healthy living			1
why did you go that route instead of writing a straight - up autobiography ? i guess i 'm not finished with all that i want to do in life			1
you can write an autobiography at any point , and i 'm not ready to yet			1
but in " @entity33 " i tell a lot of stories about my life			1
i wanted to help people understand the things i 've gone through to bring me where i am today , so they understand that journey of the weight loss , the weight gain , the self - esteem issues			1
i wanted to touch people and bring out the true you within yourself			1
@entity0 : how do you find your feel great weight ? q : it seems like you 're opening up more than ever to your fans			1
i want to paint a little picture for them			1
i want kids to pick [ the book ] up and say , " ok , i can relate to this			1
" i want it to be helpful because i know how i was as a kid , and what i needed and did n't get			1
it was n't available to me			1
q : people in the business started criticizing your body when you were just a kid , which must have been so difficult			1
yeah , it was hard from a very early age			2
my first true experience with it was when i did " @entity9 , " and they used to bind my chest because i was developing breasts at a young age			2
i got the part when i was 10 years old and started shooting when i was 11			2
i was a very quiet kid			2
a really sweet kid i might add			2
] i never said no. i said , " ok , that 's fine if that 's what you want to do			1
" i would always cave in -- still as an adult i continued to [ cave in ]			2
i never told anybody that for so long			2
not until i became an adult did anyone ever know			2
q : that 's a heavy thing to carry around			1
yeah , and it immediately makes you think , " the way i am is n't good enough			2
" that 's the message that it sent to me : " the way you look now is n't right			1
" and also on that show they thought i was too heavy and that i needed to lose weight			2
when i look back at the show , i was your average - size kid			2
@entity0 : @entity110 on beauty , marriage , and self - esteem q : would those comments make you mad ? it would make me sad			2
it would n't make me mad			2
q : considering all that you 've been through , what message would you like to send to young women ? it starts with knowing who you are and loving yourself , not looking at this person and that person and saying , " they look perfect , and they 're a lot thinner than me			1
" every body type is different -- that 's what makes you unique			1
what makes you special is you , and you are different from the next person			1
and that really begins at home			2
peer pressure is very tough			2
i have a niece who comes home from elementary school , and she 's like , " i 've got to go work out ! " and i 'm thinking , are you serious ? she 's doing push - ups and sit - ups , and it 's crazy			1
so be a kid as long as you can			2
q : do you like working out ? i hate it			2
] i love my trainer , @entity148 , but we fight all the time			2
you know how some people like boot camp , where someone 's yelling at you ? that 's the biggest way to turn me off			1
that will make me say , " you know what ? i 'm not doing this			2
" but @entity148 is so sweet			2
he knows i love sports and games , so that 's how he gets me			1
we 'll do obstacle courses			0
he said recently , " you 've got to lift			1
" but right now , i just want to run and do ab work			0
so i 'll run for maybe an hour			0
@entity0 : get the body you crave with celeb - inspired workouts q : what do you do to pass time on the treadmill ? listen to music			0
for a good run , i 'll listen to old , funky stuff like @entity175 or @entity176 -- something that makes me want to move			0
or i 'll watch the @entity178 or old , classic films			0
q : i was hoping you 'd say you watch " @entity182			0
] i 've seen it a couple of times			1
q : when it comes to your diet , are you still vegan ? i was , but my trainer is constantly in my ear about not getting enough protein , so i started eating fish			0
when we were growing up , all of us kids were vegetarians			0
no one had asked me to stop eating meat -- i just noticed everyone else around me had stopped , so i followed the crew			0
and we were doing things like getting colonics , which was really progressive back then , being 11 years old			0
@entity0 : @entity203 : are they a waste of time ? q : you got a colonic at 11 ? yeah , once a month my mother would drive us to downtown @entity210 that played a big part in my life and career , because i learned at a very young age what discipline truly meant , to be able to pass up the @entity218 fries and the piece of candy			1
q : are there any diets you regret in retrospect ? something crazy ? yes , creating my own diet			0
it worked , but i would n't advise it for anyone			0
it was during the @entity230 , and i had shot all the videos except for one , @entity232 )			0
i actually wanted to wear a dress , because i was so covered up from head to toe			0
and then [ director ] @entity236 [ @entity237 ] said , " why do n't you wear jeans and show your midriff ? " and i said , " ok , i 'm down for that			0
" and i decided to have an apple and one small bag of tortilla chips a day			0
that 's all i ate			1
this is awful ... this is not the thing to do			0
i did that for maybe a week - and - a - half , two weeks			0
plus , i was riding the bike every day			0
i do n't care what hour i 'd get back at night -- it may have been one in the morning , and i would be on that bike for an hour			0
and i lost a lot of weight			0
but i gained it back and more after that			0
@entity0 : how crash diets harm your health q : do you have a favorite part of your body ? the small of my back , because it 's the part i ca n't see			1
] i see everything else every day			0
no , i like the shape of it			0
q : is there a celebrity whose body you think is gorgeous ? @entity273 's			1
i 've always said if i could have one person 's legs , they would be @entity273 's			1
they 're beautiful and long			0
q : why do you think people are so obsessed with who 's thin and fat in @entity24 ? it 's one thing to be fitness - obsessed in a positive way , but it 's become too negative			1
i 've seen photographs of people in bikinis , circled where they have cellulite			1
but it 's like , look , we 're all human			1
some of the thinnest models have cellulite , it 's genetic			1
i think it 's mean - spirited			1
people tend to put entertainers on pedestals			0
we 're human beings , just like you			0
you may see us smiling , and whether we have money or not , we still have bills to pay , we still have our stresses			0
i think a lot of people want to focus on others ' shortcomings to make themselves feel better			0
and it 's a very sad thing			1
@entity0 : fight cellulite fast with yoga q : what makes you happy ? the beach really calms and relaxes me			0
that 's why i 'm always running to an island if i can			1
i love to travel ! another very important thing is your support team -- who you surround yourself with , whether it 's at work or at home			1
q : if you had to choose between acting and singing , which would you pick ? that would be hard			0
singing will always be a part of my life			0
but i have more of a passion for acting than i do singing , because singing comes so much easier to me			0
acting is more of a challenge			0
i always say to people , " i 'm really in the wrong business because i do n't like being in front of huge crowds , and i do n't like it when a lot of people are looking at me			0
" q : seriously ? it really is the truth			0
but when i 'm on stage , i 'm constantly moving			0
in a film you 're completely naked			0
music can be that way , too , if you allow it to be when you write			0
and i think i 've allowed myself to be vulnerable several times with my music			1
but acting is a challenge for me , and i love that			0
