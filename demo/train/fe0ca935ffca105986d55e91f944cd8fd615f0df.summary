@entity0 -- stung by an audit report this week that highlighted " $ 16 muffins " at a conference at the @entity5 in @entity0 , the hotel chain is fighting back , insisting the pricey pastries were not that expensive			1
@entity8 responded to the much - publicized cost of the muffins , disputing the $ 16 per muffin charge cited by the justice inspector general in an audit of costs incurred at @entity16 conferences in 2008 and 2009			1
" the contracted breakfast included fresh fruit , coffee , juice , and muffins , plus tax and gratuity for an inclusive price of $ 16 per person , " @entity8 said in a statement from corporate headquarters in @entity19 , @entity20			1
the @entity30 said it stands by its report , noting investigators examined receipts submitted for the reception			0
but @entity8 says " dining receipts are often abbreviated and do not reflect the full pre-contracted menu and service provided , as is the case with recent media reports of breakfast items approved for some government meetings			2
" " we made several attempts to reach the @entity5 during the course of the audit , and they were not responsive to our numerous requests , " @entity42 , the spokesman for the justice office of inspector general , told @entity1 late friday			2
the report by the inspector general noted the training conference for the @entity52 held in august 2009 served 534 people			2
the conference attendees averaged a daily cost of $ 14.74 for refreshments over the five day meeting just above the $ 14.72 limit set by the @entity16			0
the inspector general agreed the reception provided the free items @entity8 says were included			1
but the tussle in a teapot centers on the receipt for $ 4,200 for 250 muffins and $ 2,880 for 300 cookies and brownies			0
" by itemizing these costs , we determined that with service and gratuity muffins cost over $ 16 each and cookies and brownies cost almost $ 10 each , " the inspector general report said			1
but @entity8 says that simply does n't provide the full picture			0
" hotel teams tailor these events to provide maximum value and ensure the best experience possible , " @entity8 said			0
the inspector general 's report indicates the @entity8 " provided meeting space without charge			1
" but the inspector general office told @entity1 it does not know whether the food and beverage cost at that conference was in any way impacted by the " free " rental space			1
the story of pricey muffins struck a nerve because of a widely - held view that government officials spend taxpayer funds too freely			0
and it follows a report in 2007 by a previous justice inspector general which highlighted " $ 5 meatballs " at one legal conference			2
that led to tighter @entity16 rules to curtail excessive conference costs			0
@entity1 's @entity103 contributed to this report .			0

@entity8 says muffins were part of $ 16 breakfast
inspector general say it itemized the costs at conference
but it does not know whether food *tab* *factored* in " free " meeting space
