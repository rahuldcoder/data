-- @entity2 dissident artist @entity1 may not be allowed to leave his native @entity2 , but his art is free to travel the globe , and some of it is now on display in @entity7			1
" @entity1 : according to @entity11 ? " marks the first @entity9 exhibition of @entity1 's work			1
his art sprawls around an entire floor in the @entity14 's @entity13			1
the outspoken artist , blogger , filmmaker and architect is perhaps best known for helping design the famous " @entity23 " olympic stadium for the @entity21 in @entity22			1
some of the artwork on display includes photos taken of the stadium while under construction			0
@entity1 later said he regretted his work on it because instead of the venue becoming a place for all , it became a place for the elite			1
@entity1 was on his way to @entity37 in april 2011 when he was taken into custody at @entity22 's international airport and detained for 81 days amid a government crackdown on political activists			1
his studio in @entity22 was raided , and his wife and several employees were taken into custody for questioning			2
seven weeks after @entity1 was taken into custody , state news agency @entity45 reported that @entity22 police said his company evaded a " huge amount of taxes " and " intentionally destroyed accounting documents			1
" @entity1 loses tax evasion appeal " my detention was an extreme condition for any human to endure			2
many , including my family and the people who know me and care about the incident , were frustrated by the lack of an explanation or reason , " @entity1 said in a statement to the museum			2
" going through these events allowed me to rethink my art and the activities necessary for an artist , " he said			2
@entity1 was released on one year 's probation in june 2011 , with heavy restrictions imposed on his movements			2
the @entity2 government still holds his passport			0
@entity1 's criticism of the @entity2 government gained attention following the 2008 @entity77 earthquake that left nearly 90,000 people dead or missing			1
many of the victims were students who died when their poorly constructed schools collapsed on them			0
@entity1 has compiled a list of more than 5,000 of those students			0
part of the list is on display at the museum , accompanied by audio of people reading the names of the students			0
@entity1 will not be silenced @entity1 also has a work called " @entity94 " on display , made of hundreds of backpacks latched together in the shape of a snake			2
these are meant to represent children 's backpacks left behind after the earthquake			0
@entity1 said he saw numerous piles of backpacks outside schools when he traveled to @entity77 following the disaster			0
some of the works take a personal tone , with pictures of @entity1 at a hospital following surgery to relieve pressure on his brain following what he said was from a beating by @entity2 police			0
a medical scan shows the damage caused to his skull and brain			0
the exhibit will be on display at the @entity13 through february before it moves on to other venues in the @entity122 and @entity123			0
and having this work on the doorstep of policy - makers certainly is n't lost on museum officials			1
" @entity1 's art and his activism resonate far beyond the art world and encourage an expanded dialogue on crucial social , cultural , and political issues of the day , " said @entity13 director @entity128 in a catalogue detailing the exhibit			1
@entity1 paints bleak picture of his and @entity2 's future despite the personal toll his work has taken on him , @entity1 said the struggle has been worth it			1
" the struggle is worthwhile if it provides new ways to communicate with people and society , " @entity1 said			0
