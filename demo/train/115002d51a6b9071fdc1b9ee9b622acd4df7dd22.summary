for - profit businesses in spotlight the @entity64 and @entity62 claims are in yet another @entity20 category : for - profit corporations claiming a religion - based exemption			1

" vocal backing for mandate in the arguments on tuesday , @entity3 's two appointees to the high court offered the most vocal backing of the mandate			2
" @entity104 has given a statutory entitlement and that entitlement is to women and includes contraceptive coverage , " said justice @entity190			2
" and when the employer says , no , i do n't want to give that , that woman is quite directly , quite tangibly harmed			0
" @entity21 asked the lawyer for the companies : " is your claim limited to sensitive materials like contraceptives or does it include items like blood transfusion , vaccines ? for some religions , products made of pork ? is any claim under your theory that has a religious basis , could an employer preclude the use of those items as well ? " solicitor general @entity215 , arguing for the administration , said the case was really not about the government or the corporate officers : " the rights of the third party employees are at center stage here			2
" " in the entire history of this country , there is not a single case in which a for - profit corporation was granted an exemption " on religious liberty grounds , when that would harm the rights of others , he added			0
tough questions justice @entity233 -- who may prove the decisive vote -- posed tough questions on both sides			0
" the government , through its healthcare plan -- under your view -- is allowing the employer to put the employee in a disadvantageous position , he said at one point to @entity245 , representing the @entity246 and @entity247			2
" the employee may not agree with these religious beliefs of the employer			0
do the religious beliefs just trump ? is that the way it works ? " @entity245 said there were other ways to ensure an employer did not have to violate her religious beliefs , while still giving workers the mandated coverage			1
" because you have a unique situation here , where their policy is about a government subsidy for a government - preferred health care item , and the question is who pays ? " said @entity245			2
" the government paying or a third - party insurer paying is a perfectly good least restrictive alternative			2
" chief justice @entity274 wondered whether government 's interest was really " compelling " as required , when the administration had already granted so many coverage exemptions -- including to houses of worship , religious non-profits , small companies , and grandfathered health plans			1
he suggested corporate rights extend into a wider range of areas , including allowing companies -- along with individuals -- to bring racial discrimination claims			0
" does the government have a position on whether corporations have a race ? " he asked @entity215			1
@entity233 later took issue with the government on another point			2
" under your view , a for - profit corporation could be forced in principle to pay for abortions , " which is currently not allowed under federal law			0
" no. i think , as you said , the law now is to the contrary , " replied @entity215 , who said most women taking iuds do not equate that with abortion			0
" but your reasoning would permit that , " said @entity233 , sharply			0
" you say profit corporations just do n't have any standing to vindicate the religious rights of their shareholders and owners			1
" " is n't that what we are talking about in terms of their religious beliefs ? " added @entity274			0
" one of the religious beliefs is that they have to pay for these four methods of contraception that they ( corporations ) believe provide abortions			1
" under the @entity20 , financial penalties of up to $ 100 per day per employee can be levied on firms that refuse to provide comprehensive health coverage			1
@entity64 , which has about 13,000 workers , estimates the penalty could cost it $ 475 million a year			1
abortion rights groups urged the justices to again uphold a key tenet of @entity20			1
" what i think we saw today was the importance of having ( three ) women on the @entity6 , " said @entity337 , president , @entity338			0
" what 's at stake in this case is whether millions of women and their right to preventive care including birth control is trumped by a handful of @entity351 who have their own personal opinions about birth control			2
" the cases are @entity355 v. @entity356 ( 13 - 354 ) ; and @entity62 v. @entity355 ( 13 - 356 ) .			1
