let me tell you the story of an outbreak that could have happened , and did n't			1
a year ago , a mother traveled to the @entity5 with the body of her son , who had died suddenly in rural @entity8			0
she came in contact with many people in her travels and at the funeral			1
she soon died , as did the man who helped transport her and the body of her son			0
what could have gone on to become a major outbreak , killing many people , was stopped because health officials acted quickly			1
workers in @entity8 , trained by the @entity21 , contacted staff at the local plague laboratory			1
using a rapid dipstick test , the lab quickly determined that the cause of death was pneumonic plague , one of the world 's most deadly diseases			1
within 12 hours , preventive medicine was provided to more than 130 people who had come in contact with the family			1
the number of deaths was stopped at three			0
a blind spot anywhere is a risk to us everywhere keeping people safe is the role of public health agencies such as the @entity21 -- a role that becomes even more important every day			1
we are all connected by the air we breathe , the water we drink and the food we eat , and the next outbreak may be just a plane ride away			0
the world faces a perfect storm of vulnerability			1
on average , we identify one previously unknown microbe each year			2
we 're also finding that more and more infections are showing resistance to all available drugs			0
and the threat exists that sometime , somewhere , someone will unleash a deadly , genetically modified microbe for which we may have no warning and little preparation			1
since we ca n't predict where or when the next outbreak will happen , we have to be vigilant at all times			1
for example , nothing has the potential to kill more people than influenza			1
a strain such as @entity69 could create a pandemic			0
when something with that much potential to cause widespread harm emerges , we must identify it in hours or days , not weeks or months			2
@entity69 does n't yet spread from person to person , and it may never			2
but when it comes to new infectious diseases , the question is not whether , but when and where			0
one of the most serious health issues facing us today is the fact that our antibiotic drugs do n't work as well as they used to -- or at all -- against a growing number of infections			2
we risk a future where simple infections can turn deadly			2
@entity21 sets threat levels for drug - resistant ' superbugs ' for a few bacteria , we 're already there			1
@entity92 , carbapenem - resistant @entity93 , is a nightmare strain of bacteria that can resist all antibiotics , kill a high proportion of the people it infects and spread readily			1
we still have time to close the door on antibiotic resistance , but it means public health must collaborate with clinical medicine , both in the @entity105 and around the world			2
that 's a key challenge for the next decade in many aspects of global health			0
this is what it takes to save lives and protect people			2
the steps are clear : find out what 's harming people , figure out how to stop these harms , put programs in place to protect people by preventing these harms -- and then monitor to see if the programs are working			0
@entity21 has staff in every state of the @entity105 and in more than 60 countries around the world			1
our experts are passionate about their work and are committed to saving as many lives as possible			0
but you can do your part too			0
we can all help by not demanding antibiotics from our doctors and by taking antibiotics only and exactly as prescribed			0
get smart and know when antibiotics do or do n't work			0
if you or a loved one is receiving care at a medical facility , ask what they are doing to prevent drug resistance			0
also , ask your doctors what they are doing to protect you or your loved one from infection			0
drug - resistant infections can be prevented by immunization , safe food preparation and handling , and general hand washing			0
