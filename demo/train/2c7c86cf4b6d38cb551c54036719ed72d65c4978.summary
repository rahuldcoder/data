@entity0 , you 're missing not only a piece of power pop , but -- some hope -- a harbinger of things to come for @entity17 music artists			1
" is this an anomaly or an inevitability ? the feeling has been that sooner or later , ( a music artist ) from @entity17 was going to break into the global sphere , " said @entity20 , executive director of music and technology consultancy , @entity21			2
@entity26 became the first @entity6 artist to hit number one on the @entity30 music charts , and at the time of this writing was sitting number two for the third week on the @entity35 charts			1
anticipation is so high , @entity37 launched a " @entity39 " online on whether the artist will crack the number one spot			1
" i did n't expect this kind of thing , " @entity26 told @entity1 recently			0
" i made this song , i made this music video and dance moves just for @entity46 , not worldwide			0
i did n't expect anything like this : i 'm talking to @entity1 on the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) -- crazy ! " as @entity1 's @entity54 writes , @entity26 's song -- about the wannabe style of the affluent neighborhood of @entity7 in @entity53 -- has been sliced and diced with theories about what it means about wealth and class in @entity46 , and questions about whether @entity26 embodies the stereotypes about @entity17 masculinity			1
the video -- featuring his now famous horsey dance -- has spawned hundreds of parodies and so far has been watched 472 million times and achieved 4.1 million likes -- a record for a @entity8 video			0
one unexpected business bump from @entity26 's ( also known as @entity71 - sang ) has been to his father 's company , @entity6 semiconductor company @entity76 the company 's stock -- which was trading at 1,556 won ( us $ 1.40 ) on july 16 , the day after " @entity7 " was posted on @entity8 -- has exploded in value and trading volume in recent weeks , and closed monday on the @entity79 at 13,100 won ( $ 11.83 )			1
" the positive sentiment from ' @entity7 ' has attracted investors just because of the fact that the company is owned by @entity26 's father and uncle , " @entity80 , a researcher at @entity81 and @entity82 , recently told @entity83			1
but @entity26 's success was softened by the growing global popularity of @entity92 , or k - pop. the music follows on the success j - pop in the 1990s , which found a strong following in @entity17 but never crossed the @entity98 , unable to break through the @entity100 music market			1
but now k - pop has @entity46 punching way above its weight in the global music business			0
@entity46 has seen its global market ranking jump to 11th in the world from 23rd in the past six years , according to the @entity107			0
last month , @entity37 annual series of top 21 musicians under the age of 21 listed k - pop star @entity111 at 15th on the list which includes heavyweights in the western music business such as @entity116 and @entity117			2
yet @entity26 is unlike other k - pop artists , an industry fashioned on youthful looks as well as catchy tunes and dance moves			0
psy is a stocky 35 - year - old			0
the fact that his song is largely in @entity6 would make it an unlikely pick for any western music company as a potential hit			1
but the force of @entity8 and digital downloads is dismantling the old business model for music companies , and @entity17 artists like @entity26 are benefiting , analysts say			1
" up to this stage in time , big hit records were driven by the willingness of the record company to get behind the release , " @entity137 says			2
" now there is less of a dependence on this , because the web has presented a level playing field			0
" " the question that 's come about -- is he a career artist , or is ( ' @entity7 ' ) just the next ' @entity152 ' ? " he adds			2
" i really , really hope that this guy is going to crack it , because there is nothing more important for the @entity17 music industry			2
" the question is not lost on @entity26 , who is now working with @entity117 's manager to build a career in the west off the back of his hit video			1
" ( the ) music video is more famous than i am , " @entity26 told @entity1 last month			2
" i hate that , you know ? i 've got to be more famous than video			0
the video is much more popular			0
so when i say , ' i 'm @entity26 , ' people say , @entity26 ? ' and so i say , ' the @entity8 video , ' and people go , ' ahhh ! ' " so i 'm here to promote myself and say , ' i 'm the guy , i 'm the guy and i 'm the guy ! ' "			0

@entity26 became the first @entity6 artist to hit number one on the @entity30 music charts
analysts wondering if @entity26 will open the door for other @entity17 acts in @entity100 music market
@entity37 has a " @entity39 " page on whether " @entity7 " will hit @entity35 *no.* 1
stock value of company run by @entity26 's father has *increased* *8-fold* since the video 's release
