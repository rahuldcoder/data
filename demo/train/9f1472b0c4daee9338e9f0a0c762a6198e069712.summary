@entity0 , @entity1 will convene its 18th @entity7 in @entity0 during the " latter half of this year , " a party official announced this week without giving specific dates			1
the political conclave , held every five years , will shape @entity1 's future			1
it will also formalize the accession of a new generation of leaders			0
@entity1 has seen dramatic socio - economic transformation in recent years , but its political system remains opaque and antiquated			1
the @entity19 , top - down system still does not allow direct , open elections			1
instead , selections are made by a coterie of @entity6 cadres after drawn - out negotiations and horse - trading behind closed doors			1
a total of 2,270 delegates have been elected from across the country to represent the @entity6 's 82 million members			1
who are these delegates ? about 30 % are from grassroots , says @entity33 , vice minister of the party 's organization department			1
most are national , provincial and city officials			0
@entity38 and the agonies of @entity1 justice their average age is 52			1
only 5 % are under 35			0
some 23 % of them are female , and 11 % are ethnic minorities			0
although the @entity6 claims to represent the working class , only 169 ( less than 8 % ) of the total delegates are workers			1
theoretically , the delegates play an important role			2
at the end of the party congress , they will elect a new @entity52			2
this time , @entity33 says , there will be more candidates than posts -- unlike in the past when the numbers of candidates were exactly the same as the open slots			2
about 300 - member strong , the policy - making body is a motley group of provincial and city leaders , technocrats , military officers and party functionaries , plus token representatives from other sectors			1
the @entity52 will then elect a new @entity70 , the inner council currently comprising 25 members			2
the @entity70 in turn will elect a new standing committee , the elite cabal empowered to make important decisions on policies			2
the committee currently has nine seats , led by @entity1 president and general secretary @entity80			1
@entity80 , 69 , is expected to step down later this year			1
media reports say the party plans to cut the seats down to seven , but @entity33 says there is no decision on the matter			0
in practice , the selection of politicians into the @entity52 and the @entity70 are determined even before the @entity7			0
" the wheeling and dealing has long begun , " says a @entity0 - based political analyst , who asked not to be named			1
" we are now in the endgame			0
" @entity95 and the politics of @entity1 succession but the race to @entity1 's pinnacle of power remains opaque			1
" in the @entity102 you have wall - to - wall coverage of what candidates say and do and how people voted , " says the analyst			0
" here it 's all neibu ( for internal consumption ) , without open campaigning			1
" personnel decisions are negotiated and finalized by party insiders behind the walls of @entity114 , the @entity6 's official headquarters in @entity0			1
when the @entity7 convenes , it will be largely a formality			0
still , which new leaders will emerge in key positions remains a subject of speculation			0
for now the front - runner to succeed @entity80 as party boss and president is @entity124			1
@entity124 , 59 , became vice president in 2008 and was later appointed a vice-chair of the @entity6 's @entity127 -- important steps in succession			1
he earlier served as party chief of the prosperous provinces of @entity132 and @entity133 and @entity134 , @entity1 's financial center			1
@entity124 is a " princeling , " a descendant of revolutionary veterans			2
his late father @entity139 , a contemporary of @entity140 , had served as governor of @entity143 province			0
the other top contender is @entity145 , 57 , a protege of @entity80 and the presumptive successor to @entity147 when he steps down from premiership in march next year			2
@entity145 is already ranked 7th in the @entity70 and , as executive vice premier , holds important portfolios , including economic development , finance , climate change and health care reform			0
like @entity80 , @entity145 is a native of @entity156 province and honed his organizational skills when he headed the 73 million - strong @entity158 , a training ground for the party 's young cadres			1
why @entity1 succession matters many of upcoming leaders used to work at @entity158 , which is why analysts speak if a " tuanpai , " or @entity158 faction			2
other rising politicians include : @entity168 , 61 , the minister of the @entity6 's @entity170 , the equivalent of the @entity173 department , and more			1
with this portfolio , @entity145 holds all the personnel dossiers and wields considerable power in appointing party and government officials nationwide			2
@entity179 , 64 , the former @entity0 mayor who currently serves as the vice-premier in charge of economic , energy and financial affairs			0
like @entity145 , @entity33 is already a member of the @entity70			0
analysts expect both to get promoted into the @entity185			0
a few gen - y leaders may be lined up for meteoric rise			0
among them is @entity189 , 49 , the party chief of @entity190			0
no relation to the @entity1 president , he is nonetheless another @entity193 © and also served as head of the @entity158 and is known as " @entity80			1
" influence may not be confined to delegates			0
@entity197 , the retired party chief and state president , was last year rumored to have died , or was dying , but a source says he is now in fairly good health			2
" he swims 600 meters everyday and gets daily tutorials in foreign languages , economics and other topics , " says the source			0
he turns 88 next week			0
although @entity197 has been out of the public eye since retiring 10 years ago , he is believed to still wield residual influence in policy and personnel issues			0
the other influential politician is @entity95 , the @entity211 chief of @entity212 who was dismissed last april for " serious breach of party regulations			0
" @entity95 's wife @entity215 , accused of premeditated murder of a @entity218 businessman , is now awaiting a court verdict			0
the party has yet to formally decide on @entity95 's fate , but the signals are clear			2
@entity95 is not among the 2,270 party members elected as @entity7 delegates			1
that , analysts say , spells the end of his career .			0
