@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 says she felt lost and isolated after burying her husband , a 22 - year - old @entity6 corporal killed in @entity7 four years ago			1
while she struggled with her grief , it seemed that those around her found it easier to move on with their lives			0
other military wives avoided her as though she represented their deepest fears			1
family and friends insisted that her youth should provide solace			0
" after the funeral , i felt ostracized , " @entity21 said			0
" everybody liked to write off my grief due to my young age			1
they liked to say : ' well , at least you 're young			1
' " the topic of her husband -- even the mention of his name , @entity33 -- became taboo			1
she also struggled with survivor guilt that kept her from seeking happiness and embracing laughter			0
" it 's hard to laugh and it 's hard to smile after a spouse is killed , " said @entity21 , 25			1
" in a way , you feel bad , because you 're like , ' he should be here and have the ability to smile and laugh			0
' ... in another way , i think once people see you laugh or smile , they 're like : ' oh , she 's over him			2
' " after her husband 's death , the military provided a death gratuity and assisted her with funeral arrangements			1
she also received recommendations for survivor support groups			2
@entity21 researched several of the groups over the @entity63 but did n't see anyone her age			0
she was also intimidated by the size of the gatherings -- sometimes hundreds of people at a time			0
she attended some grief groups near her home in @entity72 , @entity73 , but the widows she met there were over 65 years old and not tied to the military			1
determined to interact directly with other young war widows and find out how they were handling their grief , @entity21 reached out to one whose husband was killed alongside @entity33			1
the widow agreed to a visit , and @entity21 brought along a video camera , filming their emotional encounter and their touching account of memories , love and loss			2
" it was the first ( military ) widow that i was seeing face to face , " @entity21 said			2
" and for me , it was inspiring ... like , ' man , if she can get up every day and do this with a child , i can do this			0
... i ca n't let her down			0
' " @entity21 traveled the country interviewing other military widows , compiling six testimonials in her documentary , " @entity3			1
" and four months after her husband 's death , she started a nonprofit by the same name			1
to date , the group has connected nearly 800 military widows through its website , which includes an online forum offering support and inspiration			1
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2011 @entity118 nearly 3,000 military spouses have been widowed during the global war on terror , according to the @entity122 @entity121			1
@entity21 was convinced that many of them , like her , were searching for a more modern way to connect with other widows			2
" our main form of communication with our husbands ( was ) @entity131 and @entity132 , " @entity21 said			0
" the internet ... it 's a safe haven , in a way			2
... it lets ( the widows participate ) at their own pace			2
... it allows other women who maybe are kind of afraid to step forward ... ( to ) be like ... ' you know , they look like me			0
' " social networking is vital to the youth - oriented organization , which connects women from across the country			0
each week on its @entity132 page , the group hosts " @entity150 , " where group members can share their favorite memories of their husbands			1
and on " widow wednesdays , " a new member 's story is posted			2
once members feel comfortable , they can start attending events , which take place about every two months in a different city			1
small , intimate groups of up to 15 widows meet for a few days , and there 's always a fun activity lined up , such as zip - lining , surfing or skydiving			1
it reflects @entity21 ' resolve to live with the gusto her husband had shown in life			2
it 's " kind of having that perfect combination of a time where they are just living life like it 's going out of style , followed by a time where they can reflect , " she said			2
the @entity3 is open to widows of any service member as well as women who were engaged to a service member			1
while the group accepts women of any age , @entity21 said , the average age of its members is 25			1
" our comfort zone after our husbands were killed was our grief , our pain , this feeling that nobody understood who we were , " @entity21 said			0
" and when they come to these events , they step outside of that comfort zone , and they 're laughing and they 're smiling			0
... it 's one step , but it 's the one step that leads to the next step			2
... as long as they 're taking steps forward , that 's all that matters			2
" when a widow first makes contact with the @entity3 , @entity21 sends her an introductory packet that includes her documentary film			1
the website provides a 24/7 hot line that allows immediate connection to another widow , information on support and services , and personal stories from women who have lost their husbands			1
it constantly reminds the women that they are in familiar , accepting company			0
" one widow told me ... the first time you meet another military widow , it 's like someone holding a mirror up to you , " @entity21 said			1
" and it 's a mirror that ... you have n't wanted to look into , because for once , you 're finally seeing who you are , and you 're seeing it through them			0
" six months after her husband was killed in @entity244 , @entity242 attended her first @entity3 event			1
" my little sister wrote @entity248 , " said @entity242 , 30 , through tears			0
" she did n't know how to get me through the loss , so she wanted me to find other sisters to get me through the loss			0
" from my first event , i went from feeling completely alone to not anymore at all			0
" according to @entity21 , that sentiment is returned to her in spades			0
" they 've given me the gift of life again , " she said			0
" i do n't know what my life would be if i did n't talk to a widow every day			0
i 'm so grateful that they 're in my life			0
they 've taught me that love is eternal and that life can be amazing again			0
