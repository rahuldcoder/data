going off - road used to mean tearing up dirt tracks in a powerful four - by - four or gigantic monster truck			2
for two ambitious tech start - ups however , the term has come to comprise something more subtle and potentially revolutionary			2
for the past 18 months @entity6 and @entity7 -- separate companies born out of the the same @entity10 incubator -- have been working towards creating a roving network of automated drones that will help connect rural and under - developed areas with little access to existing road or highway systems			1
while the idea may sound far - fetched to those unfamiliar with the latest in civilian drone technology , preliminary vehicle testing has already taken place			1
see also : where is the world 's best airport ? " the easiest way to describe what we are doing is to compare how mobile telephony has taken off in the developing world , " said @entity26 founder and ceo , @entity28			2
" ( we want ) to leapfrog the traditional modes of transportation infrastructure in a similar way and bring items through these unmanned aerial vehicles ( @entity39 ) to people who may otherwise be cut off or isolated , " he added			2
a network of drones the idea stems from when @entity28 led a research group including the company 's three other co-founders at the @entity47 in @entity10			1
they envisioned employing a fleet of drones with a two kilogram payload capacity and a six mile flight - range			2
these automated vehicles would be complemented on the ground by a vast network of strategically positioned hubs , enabling drones to recharge their batteries every few miles before continuing to the next station ( where the recharging process is repeated ) or final destination			2
control of the drones and the assignment of packages for delivery would eventually be handled by an automated operating system			0
orders or requests could then be placed and paid for by cell phone			0
the potential applications , @entity28 explained , include delivery of medicines to disconnected areas , enabling farmers to supply products directly to customers and providing vital materials to areas cut off by natural disasters			1
in the future , he adds , the concept could also be adapted to enhance the transport or distribution systems of large cities			0
see also : the lion city roars so far , @entity6 have reached the stage of conducting initial trials of " quadrocopter " drones , which took place in @entity92 and the @entity93 last year			1
while happy with the results , @entity94 believes the concept needs more testing before commercial or civilian deployment can be considered			0
internet of actual things meanwhile @entity7 ( @entity101 ) -- set up by students from the same @entity47 class but concentrating more on developing an open source system and ground network -- intends to develop an autonomous aerial system to service this year 's @entity108 festival in @entity109			1
according to @entity7 co-founder , @entity110 , a hyper - connected @entity39 network creates the possibility of a physical delivery system so dense and interconnected that is in effect an " analogue internet			1
" " on the internet you send digital packages			0
on the analogue internet you are still sending packages but these are physical , " he said			0
" we see the opportunity to create these very flexible networks serviced by these systems and ground hubs ( which could even be something as basic as a disused shipping container ) over very large areas , " he added			1
see also : is the @entity133 @entity132 's ' blue motorway ' as the technology develops further , @entity110 believes they will overcome the drones ' principle limitations -- namely the short distances they can travel and small weight they are able to carry			0
he also highlights cost benefits as a significant factor in making the technology attractive to potential users			0
counting the cost @entity94 agrees and points to a case study carried out at the @entity47 of the @entity147 district in the tiny @entity149 kingdom of @entity150 , which put the price of a network of 50 base - stations and 150 drones at just $ 900,000 -- comparing favorably against $ 1 million for a two kilometer , one - lane road			0
but while enthusiastic about these figures @entity94 emphasizes that he does n't see drones replacing roads or highways any time soon			1
roads , after all , still carry the obvious benefit of being able to transport people and cater for much larger and heavier loads			1
" the idea of @entity26 is not to replace systems where they work well but really to complement them , " he said			1
external factors such as how small drones perform in bad weather , how they interact with other aircraft as well as public perceptions of devices best known for their operation in a military theater will also have to be overcome , he admits			0
on top of this , the fact that drones could be adapted to transport illicit materials such as drugs is also something that must be considered			0
this is a point addressed by associate professor of aviation at the @entity186 , @entity187			0
however , he noted that while such networks could theoretically be abused in such a way it would be foolish to disregard the " host of societal and economic benefits " they could provide .			1

@entity6 and @entity7 are exploring the possibility of dense drone networks that could deliver goods to *remote* areas
the idea is to connect regions or towns where roads are *unreliable* or do not reach
preliminary vehicle tests have already taken place in @entity92 and the @entity93
