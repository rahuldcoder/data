@entity0 -- @entity5 @entity4 investigators found " serious misconduct " in the handling of remains of the nation 's war dead at the @entity10 , the @entity2 said tuesday			1
at a news conference tuesday afternoon , air force chief of staff gen. @entity12 referred to " gross mismanagement " in some aspects of the mortuary 's operations			1
@entity12 said secretary of defense @entity18 has appointed a panel to review operations at the @entity10 mortuary			1
" what i want to talk about is tough stuff			0
given the context of this , if i find difficulty in finding the right words , you 'll understand , " @entity12 said at the news conference			0
the findings came after the @entity4 conducted a year - long investigation into 14 allegations of wrongdoing made by whistleblowers involving the remains of four @entity5 service members killed in action , the @entity31 official said			2
although some of the specific allegations were not substantiated , the official said several cases of concern were confirmed , including : -- several instances in which portions of remains from troops killed in action were lost or unaccounted for			1
it included losing an ankle that had been in storage and some bags that held other body parts and remains			2
-- the body of a dead @entity58 being prepared for viewing by his family had a badly - damaged arm sawed off because it could not be arranged suitably for viewing purposes			2
the bone had fused at a 90 - degree angle , according to officials			0
the report said @entity67 , a @entity10 mortician , had the arm sawed off without consulting the @entity58 's family			1
the @entity4 found no wrongdoing and officials say preparing badly damaged bodies can be very difficult			0
but the federal @entity2 , which also investigated the matter , said the family should have been notified , according to a statement issued by that office tuesday			1
-- a @entity31 official confirmed that elements of the @entity77 and @entity4 were criticized for shipping fetal remains from military families to @entity10 in cardboard boxes			1
at his news conference , @entity12 said the investigation began after allegations from three employees " became known to us			0
" he did not identify the employees or their positions			0
but the report from the @entity2 identified the three as @entity88 , @entity89 , and @entity90			1
the @entity4 said all three are still employed by @entity10			1
" the fundamental result of the investigation was that senior @entity4 mortuary operations affairs officials did not meet standards in that they failed to act with clear indications that processes and procedures ... were inadequate to ensure accountability of remains , " @entity12 said			1
he said among their findings , investigators " concluded that the loss of two specific portions of remains constituted gross mismanagement			2
" those two cases involved the remains of an @entity77 soldier and those of an @entity4 airman			0
" in one case we have reason to believe that the remains were properly disposed of ; in the second case , we can not make that argument			0
it is simply unknown what happened to the second set of remains , " @entity12 said			0
" this gross mismanagement dealt with the fact that ... supervisors , of which there were three , failed to properly perceive and then act upon ... clear indications that there were systemic issues with respect to accountability of remains in the mortuary			1
" a @entity31 official confirmed that @entity67 , a civilian , was demoted to a non-supervisory job and now works in another area at @entity10 outside the mortuary			1
another civilian , @entity138 , a mortician and funeral director there , has been transferred to a non-supervisory job			0
col. @entity142 , the mortuary commander between january 2009 and october 2010 when the incident occurred , was issued a letter of reprimand , which is usually a career - ending move			0
special counsel @entity147 said the @entity4 has n't taken " sufficient disciplinary action against the officials responsible for wrongdoing , " the @entity2 statement said			1
but @entity12 said that he did not believe the situations cited in the report were intentional			0
he emphasized that " this was difficult work , 24/7			0
and while their performance did not meet standards , this was not a deliberate act , in my personal view			0
" the @entity4 said it is improving procedures at @entity10 but admitted that " the mortuary staff failed to maintain accountability while processing remains for three service members			1
" " while it is likely that the disposition of remains was by appropriate method , it could not be shown that it was in accordance with the families ' directions , " the @entity4 said in a statement			2
@entity18 noted that " one of the @entity31 's most sacred responsibilities is ensuring that the remains of our fallen heroes are recovered and returned to their families with the honor and dignity they have earned			2
" i was deeply disturbed to learn about questions involving the possibilities of improper handling and preparation of remains of four service members at the @entity4 's @entity189 , " @entity18 said in a statement			0
the @entity2 -- an independent federal investigative and prosecutorial agency -- said that while the @entity4 investigation " confirmed most of the whistleblower 's factual allegations , " it " nonetheless failed to admit wrongdoing			2
" " the @entity4 did , however , respond positively by changing numerous practices at the mortuary , " the @entity2 said in a statement			1
the @entity2 said that in the incidents in which " three body parts of service members killed while on active duty were lost by the @entity189 , " the @entity4 acknowledged its " negligent failure , " but " still concluded that there was no obligation to notify the families			1
" the families of the fallen whose remains were not properly handled were first notified of the investigation , and the results of the probe , over the past weekend			2
gen. @entity12 said tuesday regarding the timing of the informing the families , " we waited until it was clear that the @entity2 was going to render their report , we got 48 hours notice and we acted upon that notice			1
" the @entity2 also criticized the handling of some fetal remains from military families that " were shipped to @entity10 inside plastic pails , which were in turn placed in non-reinforced , used cardboard boxes , even though military guidelines require that remains be treated with ' reverence , care and dignity			1
' " the @entity4 acknowledged that this handling was ' substandard ' and that it ' was n't very dignified , ' but nevertheless said the remains were afforded the requisite reverence , care and dignity , " the @entity2 statement said			1
the remains of those killed in @entity238 and @entity239 have regularly been flown to @entity10 since the wars began			1
more than 6,300 deceased individuals have been returned there			0
due to combat injuries , remains are often difficult to identify and officials have long acknowledged that @entity10 does retain some human remains and parts that are so damaged they are not possible to identify			1
during his tenure as defense secretary , @entity247 allowed the media for the first time to attend some return - of - remains ceremonies with the permission of the service members ' families			2
president @entity256 has also attended ceremonies at @entity10			2
@entity147 said the @entity2 was investigating claims by three of the whistleblowers that the @entity4 retaliated against them for bringing up the problems , in one case attempting to terminate the employment of one of them			2
" the mortuary for the @entity267 military should boast the best conditions and best practices of any mortuary , " @entity147 said			2
" these events are deeply troubling , as is the @entity4 's failure to acknowledge culpability			0
" in a letter to @entity256 , the @entity2 said the report " demonstrates a pattern of the @entity4 's failure to acknowledge culpability for wrongdoing relating to the treatment of remains of service members and their dependents			1
while the report reflects a willingness to find paperwork violations and errors , with the exception of the cases of missing portions , the findings stop short of accepting accountability for failing to handle remains with the requisite ' reverence , care , and dignity befitting them and the circumstances			0
' " the @entity4 has contacted families of the war dead and @entity12 has asked @entity18 for an independent assessment of mortuary operations at @entity10			1
former surgeon general @entity302 will lead that investigation and provide a report to @entity18 within 60 days			0
@entity12 said that he and @entity4 secretary @entity307 " have taken personal responsibility for this			0
" " i want to assure our men and women in uniform , and the @entity5 public , that the @entity4 mortuary standards they expect for our fallen heroes are being met , " @entity12 said in a statement			0
the @entity4 has set up a toll free number for the families of fallen service members to call if they have questions about the investigation			0
they can call 1 855 637 2583 or e-mail dover.pm@pentagon.af.mil			0
