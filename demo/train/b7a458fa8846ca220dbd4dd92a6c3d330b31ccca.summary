-- there is optimism , and hope , that the @entity8 - brokered three - day " humanitarian cease - fire " between the @entity9 and @entity10 will turn into a longer - term cessation of hostilities -- with good reason			1
why ? militarily speaking , @entity10 is on the ropes			1
although the group has survived an @entity9 aerial , naval and ground onslaught , it has suffered a severe blow			0
despite its somewhat successful attempts to portray itself and all @entity18 as victims of a disproportionate @entity22 military campaign , in the end it failed to prevent the @entity9 from achieving almost all its military goals , while achieving very little on its part			1
the @entity22 stated early on in the campaign that their objectives were to find and destroy @entity10 ' networks of tunnels constructed under the @entity18 border with @entity22 , tunnels designed to be used for offensive attacks on @entity22 cities and kibbutzim in southern @entity22			1
at the outset of hostilities , the @entity9 believed there were over 20 tunnels			0
at the end of the fighting , they had destroyed 32 tunnels , some almost 2 miles in length and demonstrating surprising engineering capabilities			2
granted , it is impossible to know if the @entity9 has found all the tunnels			0
opinion : bring @entity10 to the table let 's look at the situation as it appeared on the day after the last rockets were fired , the last bombs were dropped and the last tunnels were destroyed			1
@entity10 has lost most if not all its offensive tunnels			1
these tunnels were constructed over several years at great expense , not only in terms of resources expended , but in terms of diversion of those resources from the construction of infrastructure projects , including schools , hospitals , mosques and housing			0
as for casualties , the overwhelming numbers of dead and wounded were @entity68			0
the death toll among the @entity72 reached almost 1,900 , according to the @entity73			0
there are differing claims by human rights organizations and the @entity22 government about how many of the dead were @entity10 fighters versus innocent civilians			1
the human rights groups say 80 % of the dead were civilians , while the @entity22 counter with a figure of just under 50 %			0
assuming the human rights groups are correct , @entity10 has lost fewer than 400 fighters ; if we are to accept the @entity22 figure , @entity10 losses would be over 900			1
given its suspected strength of more than 10,000 fighters , @entity10 can absorb this level of manpower losses			2
if past conflicts are a guide , @entity10 recruitment will soar in the wake of the fighting as young men are drawn to the organization that , at least in their own minds , successfully stood up to the vaunted @entity9			0
personnel losses will not affect the ability of @entity10 to survive			2
that said , in addition to the loss of the tunnels , much of @entity10 ' rocket inventory has been depleted or destroyed			1
according to a spokesman for the @entity22 military , @entity10 started the conflict with an arsenal of about 10,000 rockets			1
one - third of those were fired at @entity22 , albeit with limited effect , and another third were destroyed in @entity22 strikes			2
if those figures are accurate , that leaves @entity10 with over 3,000 rockets			2
the numbers can be deceiving , since we do not have a breakdown of how many of which type remain in the inventory -- do they have a large number of the more capable @entity127 - made @entity126 ( 100 mile range ) or locally made @entity129 ( 50 mile range ) rockets , or more of the less capable , locally made short - range @entity133 rockets ? in any case , @entity10 still has thousands of rockets			1
however , of the thousands of rockets fired by @entity10 ( as well as some launched by @entity138 ) at @entity22 , few caused significant damage			1
there have been three civilian deaths in @entity22 thus far in the conflict			0
the primary reason for the low number of deaths and injuries in @entity22 , aside from the inherent inaccuracy of the rockets , is the effectiveness of @entity22 's @entity151 anti-rocket / missile system			1
after similar conflicts in the past , @entity10 has been re-armed and resupplied by its supporters , primarily @entity154 and to some extent @entity127			0
the most efficient method for the re-arming and resupply effort has been via the large number of smuggling tunnels between @entity18 and @entity8 's @entity161			1
that is not likely to be the case this time -- another blow to @entity10 , which it must factor in to its assessment of this conflict as well as its future planning			0
the new government in @entity8 under former defense chief @entity170 is not a friend of @entity10			0
@entity170 considers @entity10 to be nothing more than a branch of the @entity174 , which he has outlawed in @entity8			0
he has increased the @entity8 military and police presence on the @entity18 border and destroyed many of the smuggling tunnels formerly used to import weapons into @entity18			2
@entity10 can not expect to be fully re-armed and resupplied via @entity161 as it has in the past			0
this conflict ended , at least for a while , as most of the past wars have			0
@entity22 dominated the battlefield , possessing complete control of the air and sea , and took the ground fighting deep into @entity18 , @entity10 ' home turf			1
the much more powerful @entity22 armed forces did enormous damage to the public and civilian infrastructure while mostly achieving its military objectives			2
i said earlier in this conflict that @entity22 would pursue its objectives despite the inevitable world condemnation of its so - called disproportionate use of military force , and would stop its operations when it had achieved those objectives			1
we appear to be at that point			0
there has been far too much loss of life in @entity18			2
it is time to stop the fighting and seek a solution to this current crisis and establish a framework for a long - term solution			1
we have a chance to do just that			0
in this particular instance , the catalyst for that search may just be the serious military defeat suffered by @entity10			0
fearing daughter 's @entity18 border wedding @entity226 : ' living in occupation felt normal ' join us on @entity229 / @entity228 .			2

@entity231 : 72 - hour cease - fire may prove to be end of this round of @entity18 *confrontation*
he says @entity22 achieved its objectives militarily by destroying tunnels , rockets
@entity10 can survive loss of manpower ; it still has thousands of rockets , but it 's weakened
@entity231 : too many died ; this should be a chance to find a long - term peace
