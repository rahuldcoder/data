-- some manufacturers of consumer - grade speaker systems are scrambling to make their products compatible with @entity5 's wireless features			1
the first audio equipment with out - of - the - box support for @entity5 @entity9 protocol debuted in april			1
the feature allows users to press a button on their @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 or @entity17 software and instantly transmit audio from the device to the speaker system over a @entity22 connection			2
some audio equipment companies say they 're feeling the pressure to add this @entity5 - specific feature to more of their product lines			1
that comes as @entity5 is mulling whether it will scale back or entirely do away with the ipod - dock speakers and alarm clocks it sells in its retail stores , according to a person familiar with @entity5 's discussions who was not authorized to discuss the plans			1
@entity5 's proposal to cut back on the supply of dock products it carries was first reported by @entity40 , a consumer - electronics trade publication			1
an @entity5 spokeswoman did n't respond to a request for comment			2
@entity5 's push for @entity9 is consistent with a history of flexing its influence to shape partners ' businesses , as it did for pricing digital music , enforcing guidelines on accessory makers and changing rules for app developers			1
although some @entity5 product users enjoy having an alarm clock with a dock by their bedsides to charge their phones , @entity9 has notable advantages			1
docking a 10 - inch tablet like the @entity16 is impractical , and @entity9 also allows you to transmit music directly from a computer			1
@entity5 laid out its grand vision for an untethered computing world on monday with the announcement of @entity68			0
that came nine months after @entity5 announced @entity9			1
@entity5 often nudges its suppliers into supporting new technologies , and one of those ways is by putting its marketing might behind the company 's newest offerings , said @entity77 , a music - industry analyst for the @entity78			2
" @entity79 is clearly an important retailer for selling @entity15 docks , and it is a retailer that strives to showcase the latest technology directions from @entity5 , " @entity77 said			0
" a lot of the products carried in the @entity84 tend to be at the higher end of the price spectrum			0
" ipod - dock systems without the wireless bells and whistles should continue to drop in price , serving a large mass market at stores like @entity93 and @entity94 , @entity77 said			1
however , for the equipment companies targeting the @entity5 faithful -- consumers who learn about and buy many of their products at @entity5 stores -- it 's an important venue to occupy			1
@entity102 , for one , is hoping to piggyback on @entity5 's customers			0
nearly half of the people who own a @entity102 device also own at least three @entity5 gadgets , according to a @entity102 survey			0
@entity102 debuted its first batch of @entity9 - enabled receivers in march and announced five more this week , with all but the base model using @entity9			2
@entity112 is also marching to @entity5 's tune			0
" @entity112 has several products in the pipeline for the back half of 2011 , including a new range that incorporates @entity9 , and we look forward to continuing our partnership with @entity5 , " spokeswoman @entity114 said in a statement			1
@entity5 had not alerted the company to any changes in distribution plans , she said			0
two companies that sell speakers in @entity84 , @entity125 and @entity127 , which makes the @entity129 brand , declined to comment			0
another , @entity130 , did n't respond to requests for comment			0
integrating @entity5 's wireless technology into sound systems does n't require manufacturers to pay additional licensing fees beyond the one @entity5 charges for including its @entity15 dock connector and " made for @entity15 " sticker , equipment makers say			1
however , @entity5 requires that companies use a certain processor in their electronics and , of course , include a @entity22 chip , which can increase costs , they said			2
where @entity5 does have ample space , like in its larger stores , speaker inventory appears to be unchanged			1
but in other @entity5 retail locations like the one in @entity155 in @entity156 , little space is left over since @entity5 redesigned its stores to include " personal training " and " personal setup " stations			2
there , @entity162 's @entity161 , a small rectangular gadget that uses @entity164 for wireless transmission instead of @entity9 , is hanging on a wall in the back rather than on display like it is in other @entity84			0
@entity162 is confident it 's in a better position by embracing wireless technology , ceo @entity169 wrote in an e-mailed statement			0
" we think docks are dead , " @entity169 wrote			0
" we need devices that can keep up with our on - the - go lifestyle			0
you should n't be tethered to a dock			0
" @entity179 , a wireless speaker system , is n't carried by @entity5 and sells most of its units through @entity93 and @entity182			2
@entity179 uses a proprietary wireless system but recently added a workaround for @entity9			0
the 8 - year - old company began specializing in wireless music services long before the equipment makers turned their attention to that market			1
" in many ways , docks were more like cd players , tape players or record players in that you take this thing , and you stick it in , " @entity179 co-founder @entity190 said			0
" building an @entity15 dock was not very different from building a cd player			0
" now , many equipment makers are looking at wireless options , and some are taking a scattershot approach			1
@entity9 , @entity164 and @entity205 , another standard that works with @entity208 computers and some @entity210 devices , are making their way into audio receivers , and in some cases , all three			2
add a dock to that , and you might have a product too big to fit on @entity5 's shelves .			2

audio equipment makers are scrambling to support @entity9
@entity5 is mulling whether it will stop carrying ipod - dock speakers in its stores
some speaker companies say the dock *concept* is past its prime
