@entity1 's embattled leader vowed @entity3 's abduction of hundreds of schoolgirls would be the terror group 's undoing , even as authorities admitted thursday the girls likely have been separated and taken out of the country			1
president @entity11 's statements come amid mounting international outrage over the mass abduction and the government 's largely ineffective effort to subdue @entity3			2
" by @entity18 's grace , we will conquer the terrorists			0
i believe the kidnap of these girls will be the beginning of the end for terror in @entity1 , " @entity11 said at the opening of the @entity22 meeting in @entity1 's capital city of @entity24			1
he also acknowledged the offers of help from the @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 , all of which have offered help in the weeks - old search for the girls who were snatched in mid-april from their beds at an all - girls school in rural northeastern @entity1			1
but the task of recovering the girls appeared to grow more complicated with news that @entity32 intelligence believe the 276 girls have been split up			1
" we do think they have been broken up into smaller groups , " @entity49 rear adm. @entity48 , the @entity50 press secretary , said			0
he declined to detail how @entity32 officials came to the conclusion			2
it is a sentiment that has been echoed by a number of others , who believe the girls already have been moved out of @entity1 and into neighboring countries			1
" the search must be in @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 , to see if we can find information , " former @entity33 prime minister @entity67 , the @entity68 's special envoy for global education , told @entity60			1
" it 's vital to use the information to find the girls before they are dispersed across @entity73 , which is a very real possibility			2
" the girls have not been seen since @entity3 militants abducted them on april 14 from the @entity77 in rural @entity78 , about 80 miles ( 130 kilometers ) west of @entity79 and some 600 miles from the capital of @entity24			1
that was followed on sunday night by another kidnapping , with villagers in @entity84 accusing @entity3 militants of taking at least eight girls between the ages of 12 and 15			1
@entity3 leader takes a new tact @entity3 's leader , @entity89 , took credit in a video that surfaced this week for the mass kidnappings			2
" i abducted your girls , " he taunted in the video , first obtained by @entity93			2
" there is a market for selling humans			0
@entity99 says i should sell			0
he commands me to sell			0
" @entity100 , a former negotiator between @entity3 and the government , believes the group targeted the girls to force concessions from the @entity1 government -- beginning perhaps with the release of its followers from prisons			1
" the fact @entity89 said he would sell the girls and did not say he would kill them is a clear indication that negotiation is possible			0
@entity89 's video is not going to be the last word from the group on the girls , " he said			2
now , @entity3 may be going after those trying to find the girls			2
on thursday , @entity1 police said one officer was shot in the neck during a gunfight with suspected members of the group on the road between @entity79 and @entity78			2
and on monday , @entity3 attacked @entity126 , a remote state capital near @entity1 's border with @entity63 that has been used as a staging ground for troops in the search for the girls			1
some of the at least 310 victims were burned alive			0
the assault fits a pattern of revenge - seeking by @entity3 against those perceived to disagree with the group or those who have provided aid to the @entity1 government			1
' @entity142 is of the essence ' the @entity1 government has been under fire by those who say government officials failed to take action in the hours and then days after the girls were abducted			1
@entity11 , who waited three weeks before speaking to the nation on the matter , and his security ministers have defended the response , saying efforts were under way but could not be disclosed publicly			0
@entity1 appeared this week to admit it needed help , accepting offers of assistance from world leaders			0
the @entity32 was among a number of nations who repeatedly offered assistance to @entity1 in recent weeks , @entity48 said			1
" in a hostage situation , time is of the essence , " @entity48 said			0
" ... we lost some time			0
" the @entity32 is sending a team of law enforcement experts and military advisers			0
@entity35 said thursday that it would send a " specialized team " to help			0
the @entity33 government is also sending a small team , prime minister @entity171 's office said			0
neither country said exactly what expertise their teams would bring			0
@entity33 satellites and advanced tracking capabilities also will be used , and @entity34 has promised to provide any intelligence gathered by its satellite network , the @entity1 government said			1
seven members of the @entity32 military are scheduled to arrive friday in @entity1 to join a team of advisers supporting the @entity1 efforts to rescue the girls , @entity48 said			1
right now , there are no plans to send @entity32 combat troops , he said			0
@entity1 's top security officials appealed to the public for help during a visit to the @entity78 school on thursday , according to a statement released by @entity1 's director of defense information			1
the chief of defense , air marshal @entity201 , called on members of the immediate community to provide security agencies with useful information that will lead to the rescue of the girls			2
@entity3 , which translates to " @entity214 education is sin " in the local @entity217 language , has said it wants a stricter enforcement of @entity211 law across @entity73 's most populous nation			0
the militants have even been known to kill @entity220 clerics who dare criticize them			0
the @entity32 has branded @entity3 a terror organization and has put a $ 7 million bounty on @entity89			1
@entity1 police also announced a reward of about $ 310,000 for information leading to the girls ' rescue			1
why has n't the rescue effort produced results ? why terror group kidnaps schoolgirls , and what happens next 6 reasons why the world should demand action			0

former negotiator believes @entity3 targeted girls to force concessions
@entity1 security chiefs call on those with information about the girls to come forward
search must expand to @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 , a @entity68 official says
@entity35 joins @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 in search for girls abducted by group
