-- when you think about @entity3 style , do n't think @entity4 , think @entity5			1
like the city -- which is crammed with elegant architecture -- the citizens of @entity3 's fashion capital know how to look good			1
their reputation for being easygoing and adventurous is often expressed in clothing			2
gaudy colors and bad leisurewear are n't the thing in @entity5 -- here fashionistas are more likely to mix designer threads with @entity18 's castoffs			2
but getting the look can take some effort ; it requires legwork			0
@entity5 is n't about grabbing something boring off the peg , its about experimenting			0
best street market good street markets are hard to find in @entity5 , but a 30 - minute subway trip to the northern suburbs takes you to a clothing goldmine where you can find just about anything			2
udelnaya station , on @entity31 , gives its name to @entity34 , a nearby market featuring row after row of commercial " secondhand from @entity40 " outlets			0
these are best ignored en route to the main attraction : a huge field where on weekends hundreds of locals gather to sell attic plunder			1
vintage @entity49 clothes , furniture , cameras , antiques , musical instruments , vinyl , old military outfits , pins and medals are all on sale -- as are weirder items such as breast enlargers			2
half the sellers are professional rag men , so they 're usually able to help in the hunt for something special -- although their definition of special may differ from their customer 's			2
best garage sale a hipper version of @entity68 featuring fewer mothballs and considerably more fashionable goods is held regularly in the @entity71 ( 74 , @entity72 ) , a cultural center in an old bread factory			1
during summer , the monthly " @entity79 " occupies the whole building , but the best finds can be made in the yard or on the terrace			0
even if there 's no market , it 's worth a visit @entity71 to check out art and photo exhibitions and cupboard - sized shops such as @entity87 ( @entity88 , @entity71 +7 812 980 11 66 ) , which sells @entity3 and @entity90 designers			1
there 's also the @entity92 ( +7 812 458 80 03 ) , a cheap but cheerful @entity93 ©			2
best retro shops when the markets are n't on , you can still bag a bargain			0
worth a look is @entity5 's legendary second hand and clothing rental shop , off ( 60 @entity101 , +7 8 812 929 92 03 )			1
run by a pair of extravagant shopkeepers , @entity102 features an extensive collection of @entity49 retro and vintage clothes and was favorite with @entity109 , a @entity3 artist and gay rights icon who died last year			1
off is located in a popular loft called @entity113 , where locals come to lay their hands on bicycles , furniture , shoes and musical instruments			2
best place for boots they 're not particularly stylish , but when it comes to handling the @entity5 rainy seasons -- all three of them -- it 's hard to beat a pair of @entity49 gumboots			0
these can still be picked up at the vast @entity131 factory ( 136 @entity101 ) that once produced them			0
if you 're not interested in the boots , it 's still worth a trip for a glimpse into @entity5 's industrial communist past -- one that 's slowly being reclaimed by its capitalistic future			0
best places for designer clothes @entity3 's fashion industry is just emerging , but with @entity5 is at the forefront it 's slowly making a name for itself			1
@entity147 ( 4 , @entity148 , 4 , +7 812 322 08 96 ) , the engine of the local fashion scene and one its most productive designers , sells haute couture and pret - a - porter clothes , plus accessories and perfumes			1
another leading light is @entity158 ( @entity157 , 51 , +7 812 713 14 15 )			1
@entity158 is one the city 's most popular designers and while her striking outfits might not protect against the snowy rigors of a @entity3 winter , they regularly appear on fashion week runways and represent the country abroad			1
one of @entity5 's youngest and most challenging designers is @entity167 ( @entity168 , 5 , +7 812 6491699 ; by appointment only ) , who specializes in minimalistic leather goods			0
best places for accessories sticking with @entity167 , her accessories can also be found in 8 - store ( @entity176 20 ) , one of several designer outlets in @entity179 -- a beautiful 18th - century merchant house that also houses creative start - ups			0
@entity183 ( @entity182 , 40 , +7 812 988 0448 ) is a somewhat girly outlet named after the heroine of @entity187 's " @entity186			0
" this clothing , accessories and flower shop is owned by a @entity5 socialite who , in addition to making the clothes himself , also runs a chic @entity196 - style barbershop around the corner			1
best places to people - watch for those who have mastered @entity5 style , there are plenty of places to show it off			0
the best people - watching can be found in the large - windowed cafes on @entity157 , a central street that 's busy and crowded day and night -- particularly in summer when the day is almost indistinguishable from night			0
in the fashionable @entity211 , party animals , foodies and local celebrities can be found mingling among the dozens of bars , upscale restaurants and coffee bars that include @entity217 © ( 27 @entity182 ; +7 812 416 14 16 )			0
a more highbrow scene can be found at the art house foreign language film screenings in the elegant @entity221 ( @entity222 , 24 ; +7 981 870 7757 )			0
and because this is the city @entity187 once called home , there 's @entity5 's best independent book retailer , @entity226 ( @entity227 , 15 )			2
offering more than just books , and surrounded by popular bars such as @entity238 ( @entity227 17 ; +7 812 312 - 57 - 54 ) this tiny shop has long been the unofficial center of the city 's intellectual activities and regularly hosts discussions on contemporary @entity3 cinema , philosophy and media			1
