-- imagine that we were just developing spoken language for the first time			0
and someone came up with a new word to describe an action , thought or feeling -- like " magnify " or " dreadful			0
" but in this strange world , the person who came up with the word demanded that anyone else who used it pay him a dollar every time the word was uttered			0
that would make it pretty difficult for us to negotiate our way to a society that communicated through speech			0
that 's the way the patent wars on smartphone and tablet advances are beginning to feel to me			1
as a human being , i do not particularly care about @entity25 's recent victory in the @entity27 version of its patent lawsuit against @entity29 for copying its @entity31 's and @entity32 's form and features			1
now that @entity25 is demanding that @entity29 pull eight of its products off the shelf , my only personal interest is whether the @entity29 products , once banned , will become collectors ' items			1
will i one day want to show my grandchild the phone that dared to mimic the @entity31 ? news : @entity29 to fight court ruling in @entity25 patent dispute but while the details of legalities , and the impact to share prices , and even consumer choice , do n't keep me or any of my friends up at night , there is nonetheless something creepy about @entity25 's suit			1
it 's not so much that @entity25 -- the biggest company in the world -- has turned into a competitive monster ; it 's the territory that @entity25 's fighting over			1
it feels as if the technology innovation wars are no longer over one piece of technology or another , but over us humans			1
it 's one thing for @entity25 to defend the look and feel of its phone -- things like the little button on the bottom , which seem obvious but are actually the result of a lengthy and painstaking design process			1
they may deserve a few years ' exclusive on stuff like that			0
but when it comes to gestures , such as the now ubiquitous " pinch and zoom " technology through which users stretch or shrink pictures and text -- well , that no longer feels quite the same			1
( @entity25 , of course , has argued in its court case that they are the same ; the company spent time and money on both sorts of research , it says , and does n't believe the results should be copied by others			2
) they are gestures that may have begun on the device , but now have become internalized , human movements			2
when my daughter was 3 , i used to watch her attempt to enact those same swipes and stretches on the television screen -- a phenomenon so prevalent that many television dealers now keep a bottle of glass cleaner handy , to clean their giant flat screens of children 's fingerprints on a regular basis			2
@entity115 : what the @entity25 - @entity29 verdict means for your smartphone that 's because these gestures are not simply technological innovations , but the language through which we humans are coming to navigate our way through the emerging digital landscape			1
we take to gestures and movements that grow out of the ones we use here in the real world			0
to translate them into the digital realm well requires skill , but the gestures themselves are not the typical territories -- like land masses -- over which corporations have traditionally fought			0
usually , advancements of this sort are developed through consortia of companies			0
the html standards through which the @entity148 is rendered are not owned by a single company , but developed together and used by everyone			0
imagine if one musical instrument company owned the patent on the piano keyboard , and another on the tuning of a violin			2
or what if every typewriter company had to develop its own layout of letters ? what if blowing one 's nose into soft disposable paper were owned by @entity164 ? while @entity25 deserves to be rewarded for the innovations it comes up with , there 's a limit to how far into our learned behaviors the company should be awarded protection from competitors			1
our transition toward a digitally functioning society is no less momentous than the shift from grunters to speakers , or from speakers to readers and writers			0
as such , it will require an equally cooperative spirit from the people and companies who take us there			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity187 .			2

@entity187 : smartphone patent wars seem about human behavior , not just phones
he says @entity25 defending its home button makes sense ; it 's so distinctive
but things like pinch and zoom technology may have made leap into collective *consciousness*
@entity187 : when @entity25 's innovations become our learned behavior , they 're fair game
