days after refusing to rule out recommending @entity4 combat troops in @entity5 , the chairman of the @entity2 made an unexpected trip saturday to the turbulent @entity8 nation to talk with officials there about combating @entity11 , an official said			1
gen. @entity12 traveled to @entity5 " to confer ( with ) @entity5 political and security officials on next phase of the campaign to defeat ( @entity11 ) , " according to a tweet from @entity14 , a @entity4 diplomat focused on @entity11 as well as @entity16 and @entity5			1
@entity21 spokesman @entity20 added that @entity12 met with prime minister @entity22 , as well as @entity4 ambassador @entity24 and @entity4 troops and commanders in the country			1
@entity5 pm : @entity4 - led campaign welcome if ' they do it right ' " the primary purpose of his visit is to get a firsthand look at the situation in @entity5 , receive briefings , and get better sense of how the campaign is progressing , " said @entity20			0
during the meeting between @entity12 and @entity22 , the two discussed what to do about @entity11 , @entity4 's support for @entity5 's armed forces , as well as progress made by @entity5 forces , according to a statement from the prime minister 's office			1
the troops ' victories are part of a strategic plan for liberating all @entity5 territory , and it will be achieved , @entity22 said			0
after his @entity53 stop , @entity12 moved north to @entity54 , the capital of @entity5 's @entity56 region and home to @entity4 military advisers and consular personnel			1
the @entity2 chairman met there with @entity62 , the president of the semi-autonomous region , according to @entity20			0
until recently , the @entity56 region had been the most stable in @entity5 and a cooperative ally of the @entity4			2
but it came under an onslaught earlier this year from @entity11 , one that -- so far , at least -- it has been able to withstand			0
@entity12 's entire trip , which was n't announced beforehand , is the first since the @entity4 military earlier this year launched @entity71			2
that 's what @entity73 is calling its military campaign against @entity11 , which consists largely of @entity4 - led airstrikes against the terrorist group as well as support for the @entity5 military			2
@entity80 , an analyst with the @entity81 , said saturday that it 's very important for @entity4 military leaders such as @entity12 to get away from @entity73 and see for themselves how this fight is going			2
" i think what @entity12 is doing here is sending a message both to the @entity4 troops that he understands what 's happening , that he wants to get firsthand knowledge of what 's happening , " @entity80 said			1
" and ( he is ) also sending a message to our allies , the @entity5 government , that he 's taking this seriously and that we 're committed to an ultimate victory on their behalf			0
" @entity12 has been one of president @entity102 administration 's leading voices on the situation in @entity5 , where @entity11 -- which calls itself the @entity104 -- has taken over wide swaths of territory , reportedly terrorizing citizens in the process			1
@entity102 has made going after @entity11 a top priority in recent months , including expanding coalition airstrikes against the @entity112 extremist group into neighboring @entity113			0
yet he has insisted that @entity4 combat troops wo n't play a role in @entity113 or in @entity5 , though military advisers have recently been sent to @entity5			1
yet in testimony thursday to the @entity118 , @entity12 said he would not rule out asking the president to send @entity4 ground troops into @entity5			2
he told the committee that he could envision scenarios in which a @entity4 ground contingent would be necessary there , particularly if the coalition moves to retake @entity125 or the western border with @entity113			0
" i 'm not predicting at this point that i would recommend that those forces in @entity125 and along the border would need to be accompanied by @entity4 forces , " cautioned @entity12 , " but we 're certainly considering it			0
" general leaves door open for @entity4 ground troops			0

@entity12 visits @entity56 president in @entity54 in northern @entity5 after his @entity53 stop
general meets with @entity5 's prime minister , the @entity4 ambassador and @entity4 troops
the visit came after @entity12 would n't say he would n't seek @entity4 combat troops
analyst : @entity12 likely sending a message to @entity5 that @entity4 is taking @entity11 fight seriously
