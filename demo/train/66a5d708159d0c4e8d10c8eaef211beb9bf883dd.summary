rock icon @entity0 and the @entity3 government do n't see eye to eye on the country 's oil sands energy projects and they most definitely have different views on how rock stars live			1
@entity0 , who was inducted into the @entity18 in 1995 , began a four - stop concert tour this week to support the efforts of @entity22 indigenous groups to stop the mining of the oil sands , a process in which the heavy crude is extracted from the sand , minerals and water with which it is mixed			1
@entity0 says the mining damages the environment and the @entity3 government is not honoring treaty obligations with @entity22 groups in allowing it , according to @entity32 reports			1
the government says the mining benefits @entity3 's economy and standard of living			2
" the resource sector creates economic opportunities , and employs tens of thousands of @entity3 in high wage jobs , contributing to a standard of living that is envied around the world , and helping to fund the programs and services @entity3 rely on , " @entity45 , a spokesman for prime minister @entity46 , said monday , according to a @entity32 report			1
" even the lifestyle of a rock star relies , to some degree , on the resources developed by thousands of hard - working @entity3 every day , " @entity45 continued			2
and that 's where @entity0 begs to differ			2
" rock stars do n't need oil , " @entity0 replied in a statement , according to the @entity32			1
" i drove my electric car from @entity58 to the @entity60 sands and on to @entity61 without using any oil at all and i 'm a rock star			0
my car 's generator runs on biomass , one of several future fuels @entity3 should be developing			0
" there 's evidence to back up @entity0 on that point			0
in a blog post dated september 3 , he talks about driving his " @entity76 , " a modified 1959 @entity77 , on a trip from @entity74 to @entity75			0
" on my recent trip to @entity79 in @entity75 , i drove @entity76 about 1800 miles from @entity74 running on @entity81 fuel			0
i have chosen to use @entity81 , a much cleaner fuel created from plants nourished by the sun and rain and grown by farmers rather than run on gasoline , " @entity0 's blog post said			0
it does go on to point out that on the way out of @entity75 , @entity0 ran out of the ethanol fuel for the @entity76 and could n't find any in @entity3			1
no word on how he got the car back on the road			0
let 's hope it did n't require a tow truck because , then , a rock star would need oil			2

@entity0 is on a concert tour to *protest* oil sands projects
the @entity3 prime minister 's spokesman says even rock stars need oil
@entity0 says he does n't need it for his " @entity76 " modified @entity110
