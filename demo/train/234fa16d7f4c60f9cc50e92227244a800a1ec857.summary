-- an official with the @entity3 ' nuclear watchdog agency emerged from a meeting with an @entity6 delegation in @entity7 on friday and reported no progress on a document intended to resolve issues related to @entity12 's nuclear program			1
" the agency team came to the meeting in a constructive spirit with the desire and intention of finalizing the paper , " @entity14 deputy director general @entity13 said in a statement			1
" we presented a revised draft which addressed @entity6 's earlier stated concerns			2
however , there has been no progress and , indeed , @entity6 raised issues that we have already discussed and added new ones			2
" @entity6 , world powers agree to meet on nuclear issue no date has been set for another meeting , he said			1
before the talks , @entity36 's president @entity37 urged @entity12 to take a " flexible and pragmatic " approach , @entity36 's foreign ministry said			2
@entity37 told @entity6 president @entity43 on friday , when the two leaders met in @entity45 , that @entity36 believed in serious dialogue and cooperation as the way to ease tensions , the state - run @entity41 news agency reported			0
@entity43 said @entity6 would continue to pursue negotiations and maintain contact with all sides , @entity41 said			0
@entity37 's remarks come a day after he and @entity55 president @entity54 jointly stated that " any attempts to resolve the @entity6 issue by force are unacceptable			2
" @entity54 , @entity43 meet before nuclear talks friday 's private meeting with @entity6 negotiators at the @entity14 occurred 10 days ahead of international negotiations over @entity12 's nuclear ambitions			1
officials in @entity7 had been expected to continue working toward an inspection agreement over @entity6 's nuclear capabilities			1
they have been keen to gain access to restricted sites amid rising concern about satellite images taken last month that showed the @entity6 had demolished buildings at one site that inspectors have been pressing to visit			0
the agency 's director - general , @entity75 , said last month after meeting with @entity6 negotiator @entity77 in @entity12 that a deal that would allow broader inspections of @entity6 's nuclear facilities could come " quite soon			1
" however , @entity55 and @entity36 's support for @entity12 this week may have given @entity6 more leverage in the talks with @entity14 officials			1
@entity37 and @entity54 , along with four @entity86 partner nations , signed a joint declaration in @entity45 on thursday at the end of the @entity90 summit expressing concern over recent developments in @entity6			2
" we believe any attempts to resolve the @entity6 issue by force are unacceptable , " it said			0
" such attempts could lead to unpredictably serious consequences , which would threaten stability and security in the region and the entire world			0
we call on all parties to maintain maximum restraint , and refrain from words and actions that may lead to further confrontations			0

" the @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity55 , @entity36 , @entity121 and @entity122 -- the " @entity123 , " a reference to @entity122 plus the permanent members of the @entity126 -- are to meet june 18 - 19 with @entity6 in @entity127 for another round of talks on @entity6 's nuclear program			1
some world powers , particularly @entity133 nations , suspect that @entity6 is seeking to build nuclear weapons , although @entity12 insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes			1
last month , during a round of talks with the @entity123 in @entity139 , @entity6 rejected calls to stop its high enrichment of uranium , while the international powers refused @entity12 's demand for an immediate end to sanctions imposed by the @entity3 , the @entity119 and the @entity147 that are crippling its economy			1
because 80 % of @entity6 's foreign revenues are derived from oil exports , an embargo by the @entity147 set to take effect in july will further pressure its economy			1
@entity12 threatened this year to close the @entity153 , a vital oil shipping lane , if sanctions were imposed on its exports of crude oil			0
@entity158 , which is believed to have its own nuclear arsenal , has said it may attack @entity6 to try to stop @entity12 from developing nuclear weapons			1
@entity55 historically has been hesitant to support sanctions on @entity12			0
in november , it called a new round of sanctions " unacceptable , " saying they hinder efforts to reach a diplomatic solution			0
