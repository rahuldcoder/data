-- barely more than a week into the new school year and a gunman armed with an assault rifle has attacked an elementary school in @entity5 , @entity6			1
fortunately , the gunman was apprehended before anyone was injured or killed			0
although the outcome of this most recent attack was significantly better than the carnage witnessed in the @entity12 shooting in @entity13 , @entity14 , last december , parents need to be proactive when it comes to their children 's school security plans			1
before sending their precious little ones back to school , every parent should ask their school administrators the following questions : 1			0
does the school have a crisis response plan customized for its campus ? over the last decade , many states have mandated that schools have crisis response plans			1
this sounds like a good idea in theory			0
but because they were mandated , many schools have simply copied generic plans provided by the state or another school district in order to meet their legal requirements			2
make sure that your school has a crisis response plan that has been specifically designed for its unique characteristics , demographics and personnel			2
does your campus regularly practice school safety drills ? if your campus does not regularly practice basic school safety drills such as lockdowns , shelter - in - place and evacuations , ask the administrators why not ? there is no good reason they can give you for not being prepared			1
the old adage " practice makes perfect " not only applies to reading , writing and arithmetic			0
most school safety experts advise campuses to practice such drills at least once per semester with teachers and school staff also drilling during in - service training days			1
what should parents do if there is an emergency at the school ? your school should be providing you with information regarding your role as a parent during a school crisis			2
whom do you call ? where do you go ? what do you when you get there ? what documents do you need to bring , if any ? many school districts require all parents to show proper identification to pick up their child after a " nontraditional release " such as an evacuation			2
make sure you know the school and districts policies for such an incident			0
have both staff and students received training on what to do during an active shooter incident ? it is imperative that administrators and teachers know what to do during a school crisis but it is equally as important for students to know what to do to survive an incident			0
demand to know exactly what training is provided to staff and students			0
does the school provide materials so you can discuss the training with your child and provide additional practice if necessary ? 5			0
has the school partnered with its local law enforcement agency to practice emergency response procedures ? although many schools have crisis response plans , most have not taken time to personally work with their local law enforcement agencies to co-develop plans and practice drills			1
real - time practice scenarios are essential to a comprehensive school safety plan			1
when school and law enforcement plans are not in sync with each other , important procedures that could save lives may be missing			1
we can never predict when something terrible will happen			0
but the least that you can do as a parent is to make sure your child 's school has taken the necessary measures to act in the safest and best possible way should an unanticipated disaster -- such as a shooting -- occur			1
