-- as the reigning champion of social media , @entity1 has adopted a fairly consistent strategy in dealing with upstart competitors : if you ca n't buy ' em , copy ' em. and it looks like the burgeoning field of anonymous sharing apps may be next			1
@entity1 is working on a standalone app that would let users post under assumed names , according to the @entity14			1
that would be a major reversal of the main site 's stance that users should use their real names or , at the very least , a name by which they are widely known			0
@entity1 's ' real name ' policy stirs questions around identity according to the @entity14 , the mobile app , which is due to be released in the next few weeks , is being developed by former team members of @entity27 , an app that created small personal social groups			1
@entity1 purchased @entity27 in january			2
over the past year or so , apps like @entity31 , which let users share anonymous photos and written posts , have taken off , particularly among young users			0
whisper lets users view all posts or focus on those near them , and @entity31 shares your posts to members of your extended online network but without revealing your identity to those friends			0
if @entity1 is , in fact , planning to launch its own similar app , it would be keeping with an established pattern			2
though it 's hands - down the most popular social network with upward of 1.3 billion accounts , the service has seen upstarts chip away at its dominance , particularly with teens and 20 - somethings , in recent years			0
@entity1 bought @entity57 , a messaging app particularly popular in countries where @entity1 has n't gained a solid foothold , this year for about $ 22 billion			2
@entity1 's move you might not notice it similarly scooped up popular photo - editing and sharing app @entity63 in 2012 for a reported $ 1 billion			1
for the most part , @entity1 has let those apps and some others it has purchased just keep doing what they were doing , satisfied with bringing a potential rival under the company banner			0
others , like @entity27 , have been rolled into @entity1 's larger product			0
but when a buyout was n't in the cards , @entity1 has n't been shy about borrowing ideas			0
in january , @entity1 launched @entity77 , a mobile app that focuses on magazine - style story reading in much the way @entity82 does			1
in june came @entity83 , a @entity85 - like app that lets users share photos and videos that disappear after a few seconds			1
and more than a few changes to @entity1 's @entity90 , introduced in 2006 and overhauled multiple times since then , have been perceived as an effort to behave more like @entity93			1
it remains to be seen how @entity1 , which has aimed to be home to its users ' " real " online persona on a web with a host of anonymous corners , would police an anonymous app. @entity101 , graphic sexual content and scam attempts have all been reported on anonymous apps			2
a @entity1 spokeswoman said wednesday that the company does not comment on " rumors or speculation			0

report says @entity1 working on a @entity113 - like anonymous sharing app
@entity1 is no *stranger* to buying , or copying , competitors
app will debut in a few weeks , @entity14 says
@entity1 has *mimicked* @entity82 , @entity85 and even @entity93
