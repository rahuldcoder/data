while many lawmakers have been denouncing the @entity2 grand jury decision not to indict white police officer @entity3 in the july chokehold death of an unarmed black man , @entity5 , rep. @entity5 , @entity7 - @entity6 , has been taking a different approach			1
on wednesday , @entity5 tweeted his gratitude to the jury for " doing justice " in their handling of the case			1
" thanks to @entity17 grand jury for doing justice & not yielding to outside pressure , " @entity5 tweeted			1
" decision must be respected			0
compassion for the @entity5 family			2
" later , he told @entity23 on @entity25 's " @entity24 " that he feels " strongly " the police officer should not have been indicted , arguing that there is no way he could have known that @entity5 's health conditions would affect his ability to survive the chokehold			1
" the police had no reason to know he was in serious condition , " @entity5 said			2
" you had a 350 - pound person who was resisting arrest			0
the police were trying to bring him down as quickly as possible			0
if he had not had asthma and a heart condition and was so obese , almost definitely he would not have died			0
" the @entity6 congressman also suggested that the officers had no reason to stop suppressing @entity5 , even though he stressed multiple times that he could not breathe			1
" people were saying that he said seven times , ' i ca n't breathe			0
' but if you ca n't breathe , you ca n't talk , " @entity5 said			2
" so police hear that all the time			0
" @entity5 also defended the officer 's decision to use the chokehold as an arrest procedure			1
" in this case , a chokehold was not illegal , " @entity5 said			2
" it is against department regulations , but as you look carefully , i do n't think it was an intent to put him in a chokehold , because [ the officer ] does move the baton as he brings him down			0
" @entity65 on @entity5 verdict : ' we are not going to let up ' @entity5 , who grew up in @entity6 , and has represented the state in @entity69 for nearly 22 years , also claimed no organization has done more to protect young african - americans in @entity6 than the @entity72			1
this is not the first time @entity5 has voiced his support for a jury 's decision not to indict a white police officer in the death of an unarmed black man			1
last week , @entity5 said that the president should invite @entity82 to meet with him at the @entity83			0
" i think it would be very helpful if president @entity65 went and met with the police officer , or at least invited him to the @entity83 , " @entity5 said on @entity84			2
" and say , ' you 've gone through four months of smear and slander and the least we can do is tell you that it is unfortunate that it happened and thank you for doing your job			0
