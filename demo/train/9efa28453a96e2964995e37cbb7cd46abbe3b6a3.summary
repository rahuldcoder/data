@entity0 -- in an apparent attempt to address popular discontent following the recent parliamentary elections in @entity6 , president @entity2 announced sweeping political reform in his fourth -- and last -- annual state - of - the - nation speech thursday			1
@entity2 said he hears those " who are talking about the need for change " and understands them , agreeing that " all active citizens should be given a legal opportunity " to play a larger role in the country 's political life			1
speaking before the newly elected parliament members in the @entity22 's @entity21 , @entity19 proposed that @entity6 return to direct elections of regional governors , simplify the registration of political parties and presidential candidates , and establish a new editorially - independent national public tv channel			0
in essence , @entity2 called for lifting many of the political restrictions imposed in the past several years by his predecessor , @entity33 , @entity6 's current prime minister and the @entity22 candidate for the march 2012 presidential elections			1
in addition to the modernization of @entity6 's political system , @entity2 announced a number of new anti-corruption measures and called the redistribution of power and financial resources from the federal government to local governments across the country			1
at the same time , he rejected widespread public criticism of the parliamentary elections december 4 , which were reportedly marred by fraud and other irregularities , and blamed anti-kremlin opposition figures for their " attempts to manipulate the people and foment social discord			1
" " we will not allow instigators and extremists to involve society in their reckless schemes , nor will we tolerate interference in our internal affairs from the outside , " @entity2 said			1
" @entity6 needs democracy , not chaos			0
we need to have a faith for the future and justice			0
it is a good sign that society is changing , and citizens are expressing their position more actively , setting legitimate demands to the authorities			0
it is a sign that our democracy is growing more mature			0
" on december 10 , tens of thousands of people across @entity6 turned out to protest the election results that returned @entity33 's ruling @entity80 party to power , but with a smaller majority			2
police estimated crowds in @entity0 at 25,000 , while organizers said at least twice as many participated			2
in either case , the protests were the largest in the past two decades			0
claiming the results of parliamentary elections were rigged , protesters chanted " @entity33 out			1
" a similar protest is scheduled to take place in @entity0 next saturday			2
despite a mostly positive reaction to @entity2 's speech , a number of opposition figures have told @entity6 media his latest proposals would n't have have been made , had there not been a strong public demand for change			0
and , they said , he still did n't address the issue of what the authorities are planning to do about the recent alleged voting fraud , as well as whether fair and free elections are guaranteed in the future .			0
