-- millions of @entity1 , living in desperate conditions , are hoping that the peace talks in @entity4 will bring some immediate changes			1
but the difficulty in reaching agreement even on humanitarian access -- let alone the issue of a transitional government and the future role of @entity12 -- illustrates the difficulties in translating the elite - level @entity15 meetings into real changes on the ground			1
the @entity1 government has come to the table because it thinks it has gained the upper hand politically , especially since it has become clear that @entity22 countries do not have the appetite to intervene militarily			1
meanwhile , the regime 's key allies , @entity26 and @entity27 , continue to back it strongly , partly because they see @entity12 as a force against jihadi terrorism			0
the recent @entity31 - @entity26 rapprochement has not encouraged @entity26 to change its position on @entity1 ; the opposition and its @entity35 allies are worried that it has done the opposite			1
they argue the @entity31 has in effect signaled to @entity26 that it is only interested in the nuclear issue , and is thus willing to ease sanctions on @entity26 despite its continued involvement in the violence in @entity1			1
the @entity1 government now says the @entity31 has resumed arming " terrorist groups " in @entity1 , which may be intended to puncture any such complacency			1
but arming the opposition is unlikely to tip the balance decisively when opposition forces are facing a large state army backed by other states and by regional militias			2
important absentees moreover , this form of high - level , international summit at a luxury resort is seen as well suited to interactions between states			2
it is not geared to represent the complex and fragmented mixture of non-state actors involved in the @entity1 conflict			1
the opposition consists of many different , localized factions and militias			2
the armed groups that are controlling many areas on the ground are absent from the internationally brokered peace talks , raising concerns about how any conclusion would be implemented by the @entity72 ( @entity72 ) ; compare the difficulties that the @entity75 transitional leaders , accepted by the international community , have had in actually imposing their authority over militias on the ground			1
there is also the problem of bringing the key regional players -- @entity26 , @entity83 , @entity84 and the @entity35 -- into any agreement			0
the issue of @entity26 participation was badly mishandled on the eve of the talks			0
but there are ways to bring them in through proxies or parallel diplomatic processes			0
@entity83 has signaled it may be willing to work with elements of the regime in a transitional government , but sees @entity12 as a red line			0
both the role of @entity12 , and the broader question of @entity1 's role as a conduit for arms to @entity104 will be major sticking points			1
a slow process @entity22 diplomats are trying to manage expectations , saying the @entity15 talks are the start of a long process that could take many months			1
it is predictable that they have so far stalled over the issue of a transitional government			0
in theory it should be possible to build more of a consensus on humanitarian issues , such as allowing aid into the besieged city of @entity121			0
but even food is politicized , as control of food supplies is being used as a political tactic to put pressure on opposition - held areas , and as the regime has now created a situation where agreeing to allow citizens to eat can be portrayed as making a " concession			0
" the credibility of all the supposed political representatives is suffering from the ongoing agony on the ground			1
the regime is not showing seriousness in building confidence -- despite the many options it has to release imprisoned activists and to end the siege on hungry areas			0
meanwhile , the @entity72 needs to place the needs of the internally displaced and refugees as a central priority ; this does not mean compromising on their political goals , but would rather give them more credibility on the ground			2
in interviews in @entity152 and @entity153 , many refugees have criticized the @entity72 for not paying enough attention to their humanitarian needs			0
even in a best case scenario , the solution will involve many steps			0
the first should be reaching a ceasefire and an agreement on humanitarian aid			0
the suggestion by the regime , recently supported by @entity26 , of having a " democratic election " -- which is technically due to take place this year -- is hardly a realistic option when millions of citizens have been forced out of the country			0
the opposition needs to be prepared for a lengthy process			2
the @entity72 in particular need to try to open new channels of communication with different opposition factions and gain more support from all @entity1 communities , to address the fears among some @entity1 that even if there was a change of regime , they could just end up moving from one dictatorship to another			1
the views expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 and @entity187 .			2

@entity1 government and opposition representatives are attending peace talks in @entity15
@entity186 and @entity194 say the summit does not *reflect* the mix of non-state actors involved
diplomats have been managing expectations , saying it will be a long process , they say
but they say the credibility of all representatives is suffering from ongoing agony on the ground
