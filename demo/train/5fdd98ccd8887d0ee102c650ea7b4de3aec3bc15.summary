-- three weeks ago , 276 girls awoke to a nightmare			2
on the night of april 14 , a gang of heavily armed militants attacked their dormitory at the @entity6 in @entity7 , a town in @entity9 's @entity8			1
they shot the guards , loaded the girls into trucks and drove them away into the forest			2
it has been reported that the girls are being married off or even sold for as little as $ 12 to be wives to @entity19 militants			1
since then , there has been disturbingly little action to find these girls			0
local police say that around 53 of the girls have escaped , but that still leaves at least 223 held hostage in the hands of @entity19			1
that 's almost as many people as were aboard @entity30 -- a horrible tragedy that has been the subject of intense media coverage and a massive international search			0
in @entity9 , no one seems to know where these girls are , and until this past weekend , no one seemed inclined to do much about it			1
the most determined pursuit of the kidnappers had come not from the @entity9 military but from the families of the abducted girls			1
some of the family members , armed only with bows and arrows to fight terrorists armed with assault rifles , rode into the forest on motorcycles to try to find their girls			0
fortunately , after this past week , the world is finally paying attention			0
with the families reaching out through social media , using the @entity58 hashtag ' # @entity56 , ' protests have spread across the world calling for the @entity9 government to take stronger action and for the international community to help			1
the @entity63 should help lead this international effort , and we have to take some immediate actions to help marshal a global response to this heinous crime			1
first , the @entity63 should seek a resolution from the @entity70 condemning this attack			2
it should also call for member countries to extend all appropriate assistance to @entity9 and neighboring countries to help locate the victims of @entity19 's abductions and bring them home			1
i 've joined with 20 women senators to call on the @entity70 to designate @entity19 as a terrorist group -- as the @entity63 has already done -- which would trigger additional international sanctions on the group			1
second , we should move as quickly as we can to provide intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance assets to contribute to the search for the missing girls			0
the countries of the region have limited resources , and @entity63 support with aerial and satellite surveillance , similar to what we have provided to the hunt for @entity96 and his so - called @entity97 in @entity98 , could make a significant difference in their ability to liberate @entity19 hostages			1
i 'm encouraged by the administration 's announcement that a team from the military , the @entity106 and other agencies is traveling to @entity9 to advise and assist the government with intelligence , hostage negotiations and other counterterrorism expertise			2
finally , we must work to strengthen the capabilities of local authorities in @entity9 and other countries in the region to protect children , particularly girls , and combat human trafficking through civilian law enforcement			1
our current security sector assistance programs for these countries remain weighted towards their armed forces rather than building the capacity of civilian law enforcement to protect citizens where they live			0
we should use the expertise of the @entity128 , @entity129 , and @entity130 to help design and implement robust programs that bolster anti-trafficking efforts in these countries over the long term			0
make no mistake , how we respond to the abduction of the girls of @entity9 will be a moral test of our nation 's commitment to the fight against modern - day slavery			1
human trafficking is a stain on the conscience of the world and is now the world 's third - largest criminal enterprise , behind only drug - and gun - trafficking			0
i recently led a delegation to @entity154 to talk about how we can coordinate with other countries to fight sex trafficking around the world			0
the @entity63 can work with local officials to help them crack down on traffickers and support victims			2
but this is n't only a problem in countries half a world away -- it 's happening in our own backyards			0
in fact , 83 % of the victims in the @entity63 are @entity63 citizens			2
i 've introduced a bipartisan bill with sen. @entity169 , @entity170 , to fight sex trafficking in @entity63 by making sure minors sold for sex are n't prosecuted as criminals but are instead treated as victims			1
the bill also allows victims of sex trafficking to participate in the @entity179 program to help them get back on their feet , and would create a @entity181 to encourage cooperation among all the federal , state , and local agencies that work on this problem			0
we can not close our eyes to these horrific acts in our own country and across the globe , including the clear evidence of barbarity unfolding before us in @entity9			2
our action or inaction will be felt not only by those schoolgirls being held captive and their families waiting in agony , but by victims and perpetrators of trafficking around the world			0
now is the time to act			0
join us on @entity204 / @entity203 .			0

sen. @entity206 argues that the @entity63 must help lead the effort to rescue the kidnapped @entity9 girls
more than *200* girls were abducted earlier this month , many have reportedly been sold
the militant group @entity19 has claimed responsibility
