-- @entity1 and @entity2 began their " supervised release " friday after president @entity3 commuted their sentences in january for convictions related to the shooting of a @entity9 drug smuggler			1
@entity2 has been out of prison since febrary after serving time in the shooting of an illegal immigrant			1
@entity2 and @entity1 were able to remove their electronic monitoring devices and leave their homes in @entity17 , @entity18 , on friday for the first time since they left prison in february			1
after spending two " hard , long , lonely " years in prison , the two said they were looking forward to spending time with their families and putting this chapter of their lives behind them			1
" there are more important things than the people that have done this to us or what we have gone through and i am not going to sit here and dwell on that , " @entity2 said in an interview with @entity0 's " @entity28			1
" " we are looking ahead			0
we 're optimistic for a very good future and that 's what 's more important , " @entity2 said			1
their release in february marked a significant turning point in a case that served as a flash point in the debate over immigration and border security			0
the two were sentenced in 2006 to 11 - and 12 - year sentences stemming from the february 2005 shooting of @entity52 near the @entity54 - @entity9 border south of @entity17 , @entity18			2
critics of @entity54 immigration policy rushed to the agents ' defense , saying they were merely doing their jobs			0
civil liberties advocates argued that @entity1 and @entity2 used excessive force			1
@entity2 credited the outside support with helping him win clemency and keeping his spirits up during his imprisonment			2
" members from @entity70 were speaking about us , people writing us constantly , it felt so good to know that people did n't give up on us and that people constantly believed in us , " he said			0
" how can you give up when people are n't giving up on you ? " @entity1 echoed his sentiments , saying he was shocked to this day over the support he received			1
" i did n't expect it			0
i expected people to really forget all about us once we turned ourselves in , " he said			0
like @entity2 , @entity1 said the most difficult part of going to prison was leaving behind his wife and children			1
" i think that 's been the hardest			0
when i turned myself in , my son was 4 months old , " he said			0
" there 's really nothing special i want to do			0
the only thing i 'm really looking forward to is getting out of the house and going out to dinner with my wife and going to the park with my sons , " @entity1 said			1
their legal cases are far from over			0
the convictions still stand and the two remain felons while appeals are pending , which means they can not contact one another or reapply for their jobs , something @entity2 said he would like to do			2
@entity2 shot @entity52 in the buttocks after he ditched a vehicle carrying more than 700 pounds of marijuana and fled on foot toward @entity9			2
the agents said during trial that @entity52 had brandished a gun while resisting arrest , but @entity52 said he was unarmed and trying to surrender when @entity1 attempted to beat him with a shotgun			2
" in exchange for immunity , @entity52 agreed to cooperate with the investigation of the shooting , and he returned to the @entity54 so that the bullet could be removed from his body , " according to court documents			0
@entity2 and @entity1 were convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon , lying about the incident and violating @entity52 's @entity124 right against illegal search and seizure			1
sen. @entity127 , @entity128 , a vocal critic of the decision to grant @entity52 - @entity131 immunity , said several key pieces of evidence were withheld from the jury that convicted @entity2 and @entity135			2
the jury , for instance , never learned that @entity52 was running drugs at the time of the shooting			0
nor did jurors learn that @entity52 breached his immunity agreement by continuing to smuggle drugs into the @entity54 , @entity127 has said			0
" several jurors have since come forward to state that if they had been told about the excluded evidence , they would have changed their verdict , " @entity127 wrote in a january plea to @entity3 , requesting clemency for the agents			1
despite @entity2 ' and @entity1 's appeals for clemency , a senior @entity3 administration official said the men were " convicted felons who violated their oaths to uphold the law			1
" leading @entity158 and @entity159 , however , supported @entity3 's commutation , the official said			2
" the president has reviewed the circumstances of this case as a whole and the conditions of confinement and believes the sentences they received are too harsh and that they and their families have suffered enough for their crimes , " the official said .			0
