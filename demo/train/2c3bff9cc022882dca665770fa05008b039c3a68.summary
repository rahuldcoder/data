the @entity9 driver , who suffered life - threatening head injuries , crashed into a recovery vehicle at @entity12 in october and was immediately taken to hospital			1
the 25 - year - old remains unconscious at a @entity16 hospital in @entity17 but is breathing unaided and is no longer in an artificial coma			1
the @entity16 suffered a diffuse axonal head injury after colliding with the @entity20 of @entity21 , which was being removed from the circuit			2
according to a 396 - page report put together by a 10 - person panel at the @entity7 - @entity26 's governing body -- " @entity5 did not slow sufficiently to avoid losing control at the same point on the track as @entity21			1
" the report also states that during the " two seconds @entity5 's car was leaving the track and traversing the run - off area , he applied both throttle and brake together , using both feet			1
" the @entity39 algorithm is designed to over-ride the throttle and cut the engine , but was inhibited by the @entity42 , which controls the rear @entity45 ( @entity44 ) system , " said the report			0
" @entity5 's @entity9 has a unique design of @entity44 , which proved to be incompatible with the @entity39 settings			1
" according to the report , @entity5 's car , which weighed 700 kilograms , hit the 6500kg crane at a speed of 126 kilometers an hour			2
" @entity5 's helmet struck the sloping underside of the crane , " read the report			2
" the magnitude of the blow and the glancing nature of it caused massive head deceleration and angular acceleration , leading to his severe injuries			0
" all rescue and medical procedures were followed , and their expediency are considered to have contributed significantly to the saving of @entity5 's life			0
" the @entity7 also confirmed that the actions taken following @entity21 's crash were " consistent with the regulations " and state there was no " apparent reason " why the safety car should have been deployed sooner			0
it also states that @entity5 " over-controlled the oversteering car , such that he left the track earlier than @entity21 , and headed towards a point " up - stream " along the barrier			0
" unfortunately , the mobile crane was in front of this part of the barrier , and he struck and under - ran the rear of it at high speed			0
" @entity5 's @entity9 team folded in november after administrators failed to find fresh investment			1
in the days after the crash , @entity9 moved to address accusations that @entity5 had not reduced his speed and that the team had actively encouraged him not to do so			1
" the @entity94 is shocked and angered by these allegations , " said the statement issued in october			0
" at a time when its driver is critically ill in hospital , and the team has made clear that its highest priority is consideration for @entity5 and his family , it is distressed to have to respond to deeply upsetting rumors and inaccuracies in respect of the circumstances of @entity5 ' accident			1
" regarding point 1 , @entity5 did slow down under the double waved yellow flags			0
that is an irrefutable fact , as proven by the telemetry data , which the team has provided to the @entity7			0
" regarding point 2 , an audio copy of the full radio transmission between @entity5 and the team , and a written transcript , were provided to the @entity7			2
" it is quite clear from the transmission and the transcript that at no point during the period leading up to @entity5 ' accident did the team urge @entity5 to drive faster or make any comments suggesting that he should do so			0
