-- third seed @entity1 will play world no. 1 @entity3 in the final of the @entity6 after overcoming @entity7 in a tense five - set semifinal in @entity9 friday			1
sunday will see a repeat of the 2011 final , with @entity1 looking to avenge his defeat to @entity3 after beating 17 - time grand slam winner @entity7 6 - 4 6 - 7 ( 5 - 7 ) 6 - 3 6 - 7 ( 2 - 7 ) 6 - 2			1
@entity1 will be looking to finally capture the @entity9 title having twice been runner - up at the year 's first grand slam			1
the 25 - year - old @entity21 is also looking for his second straight grand slam title after beating @entity24 ace @entity3 in the final of the @entity26 last september , the first time he had claimed one of the four major titles in tennis			1
should he repeat that victory over @entity3 in the @entity29 final , @entity1 would become the first player to follow up his maiden grand slam title with another at the first opportunity			1
world no. 2 @entity7 was hoping to become the first man in the post- 1968 open era to win the @entity6 on five occasions , but came up short in a high quality match lasting exactly four hours			2
it was the first time @entity1 had beaten @entity7 at a grand slam , but his victory over the @entity43 maestro in the gold medal match at the @entity45 in @entity46 has acted as a springboard for his later successes			1
@entity1 never trailed throughout the match on the @entity50 , but was twice pegged back as @entity7 won the second and fourth sets on tiebreaks			1
@entity1 served for the match in the fourth set at 6 - 5 , but was denied victory by some brilliant attacking tennis by the second seed as he broke back			2
@entity7 carried that momentum into the subsequent tiebreak to force a decider , but @entity1 showed his mettle by taking control again			0
an early break saw him forge 5 - 2 ahead and when @entity7 served to stay in the match , he was unable to offer more than token resistance , hitting long as @entity1 sealed an epic and deserved victory			2
" i 've been known for losing a lot of tough matches and big matches , especially here a few times , and having never beaten @entity7 in a big match until the @entity72 , " he said in his court side interview			0
" that obviously helps but it does n't make it any easier when you 're trying to serve it out			0
" the 31 - year @entity7 insisted he would bounce back after his third straight semifinal loss in @entity9 and dismissed notions that he would struggle to compete with younger rivals such as @entity3 and @entity1			1
" i go from here with a good feeling for the year			0
i did n't play a tournament leading in , so now obviously i know where my level is at , " he told gathered reporters			0
" i also know that i have even more time to work on my game , work on my fitness this year			0
it 's something i 'm excited about			0
" saturday will see the women 's final between @entity91 and former @entity93 champion @entity92			0
the championship will close when @entity1 and @entity3 lock horns 24 hours later , with spectators hoping for a repeat of their epic semifinal clash last year where the latter prevailed in a five set thriller before beating @entity101 in a marathon final			2
@entity101 , the other member of the ' big four ' , is currently sidelined by a long - term injury but intends to make his comeback next month .			0

@entity1 will play @entity3 in sunday 's @entity6 final
