@entity0 -- imagine a future in which icons flash on your car windshield , hologram style , as your car approaches restaurants , stores , historic landmarks or the homes of friends			1
simply point your hand at them , and the icons open to show real - time information : when that bridge over there was built , what band is playing at that nightclub on the left , whether that new @entity22 © up the street has any tables available			2
wave your hand again , and you 've made a restaurant reservation			2
@entity27 showed off this vision of the future of driving -- complete with augmented - reality and gesture - controlled features -- this week at the @entity33			1
@entity33 is the world 's biggest technology trade show , and carmakers are becoming a bigger presence here			1
visitors climbed into a little cockpit at the @entity27 booth and took a brief , interactive and virtual ride through nighttime @entity42 -- with the high - tech windshield as a guide			1
" gesture is very intuitive			2
it 's very natural , " said @entity46 , a user - interface designer with @entity27 who led demonstrations of the technology			1
" you point at something , and you want to know more about it			2
" the technology is still crude , and at least several years away from finding its way into @entity27 vehicles			1
but it illustrates how automakers , while embracing current computer innovation such as dashboard touchscreens and voice - control interfaces , also are keeping an eye further down the road as well			0
as digital tech -- and our expectations for it -- becomes more mobile , carmakers are taking notice			1
many automotive designers here seem to have taken inspiration from smartphones , with their promise of being always connected and their vast menu of apps for every purpose			1
" cars are becoming platforms to participate in the digital world in a fully networked sense , just like your tablets can and your phones can , " said @entity75 , a senior technical leader with @entity77 's innovation division			1
" it 's our job to take those computing services people are used to at 0 mph and make them available at 70 mph			0
" yes , that sounds a little scary			0
and with escalating concerns about the hazards of distracted driving , automakers must walk a fine line between convenience and safety			0
automotive engineers are continually trying to simplify their interfaces to cut down on the precious seconds that a driver 's attentions are diverted from the road ahead			1
" all of our technology is voice - powered , " @entity77 product manager @entity102 told @entity1 's sister network @entity103			2
" so instead of fumbling with your phone ... you keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road			0
" @entity111 , head of advance product planning for @entity113 , agreed : " we determine which apps should be in the car and which should n't			0
we have these apps integrated in such a way that they 're actually relevant to you			0
" for example , say you 're running late to a meeting and ca n't call or text while driving			0
@entity27 ' messaging app will create a menu of logical missives based on your location and your car 's speed -- " i 'm stuck in traffic , " or " i 'm just north of @entity132 " -- and display them on the screen			1
you scroll through them and push a button to post the one that fits , instead of having to manually type the words			0
@entity77 this week introduced five new apps for its pioneering sync hands - free entertainment system , including @entity141 , a daily - deals application that provides real - time discounts relevant to a driver 's location			0
@entity77 is so committed to morphing its vehicles into digital platforms that the company is recruiting developers to create apps for @entity140 and plans to open a research lab in @entity152 this year			1
meanwhile , @entity27 launched the second generation of its mbrace system , which connects drivers with the web via customized apps that can be controlled by voice commands or on a dashboard touchscreen			1
@entity161 is now cloud - based , meaning it 's always connected and its software can automatically update itself			0
not to be outdone , @entity165 and @entity166 also have big presences at @entity33 , and both announced updated versions of their web - based dashboard entertainment systems			1
the boldest advancements in automotive tech , however , may be a few years away			1
all the major car companies are working on systems that would allow vehicles to talk to each other about road conditions , weather and traffic snarls			2
for example , a car swerving to avoid a tire in the road could send an instant message alerting surrounding vehicles to the hazard			2
@entity77 also is developing technology that takes a more holistic approach to driver safety and welfare			2
instead of focusing on preventing collisions , for example , a car could help diabetic drivers by employing wireless sensors to monitor their glucose levels , said @entity197 , @entity77 manager of vehicle design and infotronics			0
or a car could help allergy sufferers by monitoring for high - pollen areas , then recirculating air within the vehicle instead of pulling it in from the outside , he said			0
@entity166 is testing something called the " user - centered driving concept , " which would emphasize safety by employing an infra - red led and camera to monitor the driver 's face for alertness			0
the system would recognize whether the driver 's eyes are opened or closed , safeguarding against an accident caused by the driver falling asleep			0
all these advancements may make driving more interesting			0
or they may spoil one of modern society 's last refuges from the hyper - connected digital world			1
either way , they are coming soon			0
" we 're working on a new generation of vehicles that truly serve as digital companions , " said @entity228 , head of @entity230 , in a keynote speech at @entity33			1
" they learn your habits , adapt to your choices , predict you moves and interact with your social network			0

many automotive designers seem to take inspiration from smartphones
cars are becoming platforms to participate in the digital , networked world
technology is still crude , and several years away from finding its way into vehicles
