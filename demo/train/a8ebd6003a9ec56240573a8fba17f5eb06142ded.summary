-- as a cosmetics saleswoman , @entity1 constantly fielded the same question from women looking at mascara ads perched on her department store counter : are those eyelashes real ? um , no , she told them			1
@entity11 alone would never -- could never -- produce eyelashes as full and thick as those on the models			0
armed with the truth , most customers did the natural thing : they bought the mascara anyway , said @entity1 , now a pro makeup artist in @entity19 , @entity20			1
" even i can still be sucked in by the hype , " said @entity1 , who knows full well her facial artistry will be airbrushed by photographers until the models she works on barely resemble those she started with			0
" i know the extent of the deception			0
sometimes i tell young girls , ' it 's not a real image			0
' " i 'm shocked ! beauty ads lie ? do beauty ads tell the truth ? does it matter ? the banning this week of two @entity37 ads featuring @entity38 and @entity39 in the @entity40 for being so retouched they no longer reflected reality produced a pronounced shrug from across the pond , where psychologists and cosmetics industry gurus posited that @entity49 women are in on the game -- and they do n't necessarily care			1
' @entity51 ' @entity38 too pretty ? " we do n't want to see an ordinary person in the ads. we want to see a spectacular person , " said @entity52 , a clinical psychologist in @entity53			1
" you underestimate women when you think we ca n't see beyond the facts			1
we 're aspiring to improve ... we want to feel like we 've done what we can			0
" what is beauty and who has it ? the $ 10 billion cosmetics industry walks a fine line in promising lotions and potions will help consumers turn back the clock , diminish lines , lift eyelids or brighten dull complexions			1
the @entity75 , which regulates truth in advertising in nearly every sector , requires companies to be able to substantiate these claims , but creative and conditional words such as " reduces appearance of , " " repairs hair " and " skin looks younger " do n't lend themselves to easy or enforceable definitions			1
" doing these ads is not simply careless , " said @entity86 , ceo of just ask a woman , a @entity89 marketing agency that 's done business with the likes of @entity92 and @entity93			2
" they do n't just write anything they want			2
it 's creative , but it 's accurate			0
" just like beauty , however , accuracy and exaggeration are in the eye of the beholder			2
@entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 author known as the " @entity108 " who was fired from her first two jobs for refusing to sell skin care products that did n't work as advertised , said hair care , anti-aging and anti-acne products tend to have the most exaggerated to downright false claims			1
" an example of this type of wording is , ' skin appears more even and looks lifted			0
' that states what women want to hear but does n't state skin will be lifted or even , " said @entity105 , who has written 17 controversial books on the cosmetics industry and annually reviews thousands of products from more than 400 skin care companies			1
" but there are also many times when the ad or claim is just out and out not telling the truth			2
" what about women who really believe the hype and then realize they do n't still look 25 ? they tend to be the same people who are dissatisfied with their lives in general and base their self - worth on how they look , experts say			1
and they do have options , albeit expensive ones			0
those inclined to go under the knife can place their hopes in cosmetic surgery , while many will continue to plunk down tens or hundreds of dollars , cruising from brand to brand , on products that may continue to disappoint			0
" i do n't think this is a conscious thought process , but we want to grab on to something , " said @entity151 , a psychotherapist near @entity152			2
" if women are really trying to figure out how to love themselves , trying to find that self - worth in a product or a cream , then these companies are not really selling a product , they 're selling a state of mind			2
" " we never really do n't have an option ... and that 's why these companies are thriving , " @entity151 added			2
" there 's endless possibility			0
so many people are addicted to the process			0
" even industry executives are n't immune			1
" i know if i buy a tube of lipstick and put it on , i 'm not going to look like @entity39 , but an ad with @entity39 is going to get my attention , " said @entity171 , vice president and associate general counsel at the @entity173 , a national trade association for the cosmetics industry			1
" it 's human nature			0
" ' can i touch it ? ' the fascination with natural , @entity185 - @entity49 hair			0

beauty ads do n't show the truth , but do women really care ?
psychologists , cosmetics industry say women know advertisements are *misleading*
ads featuring @entity38 , @entity39 were banned in the @entity40 for being retouched
