-- @entity1 answered her critics			1
as the week comes to an end , here 's a look back at these stories and other international news that developed , including a surprising election in @entity10 and a growing humanitarian crisis in @entity12			1
@entity13 in @entity14 hot seat at times angry and choked with emotion , secretary of state @entity1 appeared before two congressional committees wednesday and answered questions about her department 's handling of the attack that killed four @entity22 , including a @entity22 ambassador , in @entity14 , @entity24 , last year			1
while @entity13 was mostly calm and composed during the two hearings , which lasted more than five hours in all , she became visibly frustrated when sen. @entity26 , a tea - party backed @entity29 @entity28 , said the @entity22 public was deliberately misled			0
" with all due respect , the fact is we had four dead @entity22 , " @entity13 said , banging her hand on the table			0
" was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they 'd go kill some @entity22 ? what difference , at this point , does it make ? it is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening			0
" what did we learn from wednesday 's testimony ? here are five of the key themes , including what @entity13 did on the day of the attack			1
@entity13 also warned of a growing security threat in @entity54 , saying there was " no doubt " that weapons from @entity24 were used in last week 's attack on an @entity60 natural gas plant			1
which leads to ... the future of terrorism ? there are still outstanding questions over the @entity60 standoff , which resulted in the deaths of at least 37 hostages			0
@entity71 , the @entity54 branch of @entity70 , has claimed responsibility for the attack			2
@entity60 said the attack was retaliation for letting @entity75 use its airspace in its offensive against @entity79 militants in @entity80			2
the question now is whether this was an isolated act of revenge or , as @entity13 alluded to , an ominous sign of things to come in the region , where @entity79 militants are quickly gaining traction			0
one expert believes we might be seeing the future of terrorism			0
" @entity98 has become a difficult environment to conduct large - scale terrorist incidents , and @entity22 even more so , " said @entity93 , a senior fellow at the @entity94 , a @entity95 - based think tank that specializes in defense and security issues			2
" but at the same time , groups desire to attack @entity103 targets both for ideological reasons and to attract attention to their cause has not diminished			2
the net result is that they will aim to target @entity103 where they can find and reach them			0
" @entity3 's defiant threat the @entity113 adopted a resolution tuesday condemning @entity3 's recent rocket launch and expanding sanctions against the country			1
but @entity3 remains defiant , saying it plans to carry out more long - range rocket launches and another nuclear test			1
it also vowed an " upcoming all - out action " to target the @entity22 , which it called " the sworn enemy of the @entity124 people			0
" by friday , @entity124 had been threatened as well			0
the @entity22 envoy to @entity3 responded by saying the @entity22 would ultimately judge @entity3 by its actions , not by its words			1
some experts say the @entity22 should give up on negotiation altogether and take a tougher stance			0
@entity3 has conducted two previous nuclear tests -- one in 2006 and one in 2009 -- but analysts say it does not have the technology to mount a nuclear warhead on a missile			1
@entity10 's surprising election as many expected , @entity10 prime minister @entity139 and his right - wing party received the most votes in tuesday 's national elections			1
but the surprising second - place finish of the centrist @entity145 party -- led by @entity10 tv personality @entity146 -- might convince @entity139 to form a more moderate government coalition rather than a hard - right bloc			1
( in @entity10 's @entity150 , coalitions must be built because no single party ever wins a majority of seats			1
) " the pundits did not understand what @entity10 society was thinking and feeling , " said @entity154 , executive director of the @entity155 , an advocacy group			2
" instead of the far right , they went to the center			0
... they were saying , ' @entity161 to those values , the values @entity10 was established on , liberal @entity10 , secular @entity10 , moderate @entity10 -- an @entity10 where peace with our neighbors is important but security is also important			2
' " the high voter turnout also confounded critics as the @entity10 public " turned out to be far more engaged than many had imagined , " wrote @entity170 , ceo and president of the nonpartisan @entity155			2
@entity12 's humanitarian crisis as many as 20,000 @entity12 refugees flooded @entity175 this week , according to the nation 's foreign minister and refugee officials			1
there are now nearly 700,000 people who have fled @entity12 for neighboring countries , straining resources in places like @entity175 , @entity184 and @entity185			1
@entity0 's @entity186 visited a refugee camp in @entity185 where a @entity22 delegation arrived thursday			0
he had an exclusive interview with the @entity22 ambassador to @entity12 , who described how the @entity22 has given $ 210 million in humanitarian aid and $ 35 million to help the @entity12 political opposition			2
" the assistance is going in , " ambassador @entity193 said			0
" it 's things like tents , it 's things like blankets , it 's things like medical equipment , but it does n't come in big boxes with an @entity22 flag on it because we do n't want the people who are delivering it to be targeted by the @entity12 regime			1
" @entity193 said the needs are gigantic and that much more aid is needed , but he stressed that even with help from the @entity22 and other countries , " it has to be @entity12 who find their way forward			1
" other notable stories from this past week : -- @entity95 's prince @entity215 reveals that he killed @entity217 militants during his tour in @entity219			2
he also spoke out for the first time about his notorious @entity222 trip and the nude photographs that surfaced			0
-- people from northern @entity80 share harrowing stories about the cruel punishments now being inflicted by @entity79 militants there			0
-- a journalist embedded with @entity22 troops in @entity219 describes how the troops are using a " tough love " approach , stepping back so that their @entity219 counterparts have no choice but to assume more responsibility and take over the fight			0
-- a 56 - year - old @entity95 woman caught carrying more than 10 pounds of cocaine in her suitcase has been sentenced to death in @entity241 .			0
