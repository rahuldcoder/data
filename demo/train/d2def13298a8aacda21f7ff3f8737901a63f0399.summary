-- although the tower in question in the gimcrack action comedy " @entity5 " is fictional , many @entity2 tourists will recognize the aggressive nouveau - riche opulence of the building 's exterior as that of an actual @entity11 hotel condominium owned by aggressive nouveau - riche @entity12			1
the aesthetic pairing of @entity12 and director @entity15 is a natural			2
this brassy production , an imitation " @entity19 's @entity18 , " features the name - brand talents of @entity22 ( as an honorable tower manager named @entity24 ) and @entity25 ( as a con man called @entity27 ) leading rookie thieves in an elaborate @entity30 - style heist			1
their target ? the oversize penthouse of one @entity34 ( @entity35 ) , a shady billionaire who keeps a rare 1963 @entity36 in his living room			0
in other words , " @entity5 " is the cinematic version of a @entity12 property : overblinged , eye - catching , and essentially tacky			1
for a movie that claims its heart is with the masses -- the 99 percent ! -- there 's an awful lot of production - design admiration lavished on the trappings of the effin - rich 1 percent			2
( @entity15 had specific ideas about which pedigreed modern - art reproductions he wanted on the walls			0
) @entity34 is a fictional variation on @entity52 : entrusted with the retirement savings of the multicultural low - wage employees who keep the @entity56 , he takes their money and ruins their lives			0
and so , rallied by egalitarian friend - to - all @entity24 -- the guy takes the subway to work from @entity63 , so you know he 's a mensch -- and hastily educated in criminal technique by @entity24 's less honorable @entity27 , these blue - collar little people rise up in triumph to steal their money back			2
by the moral standards of @entity70 , the crime earns an ethical thumbs - up			0
you may think i am picking too much on what 's built to be a fun , diverting , @entity2 - state - of - mind caper comedy -- a joke - filled cavalcade that marks 50 - year - old @entity25 's welcome return to the edgier stuff that made him famous			1
alrighty , let 's talk about @entity25 : he 's nowhere to be found in the first half of the movie ! and he 's only there to illuminate selected scenes in the second : he 's like the spot lighting supplied by a big - a * * chandelier in an ostentatious @entity12 lobby			1
that 's too bad , because when @entity25 is on screen , his comedic vigor -- reminiscent of @entity96 's jive - talk mania in @entity15 's " @entity98 " movies but with a blast of @entity25 - specific danger -- gooses the movie 's energy level			1
i 've missed that guy			0
but whenever @entity25 wanders off , the movie 's pulse rate drops			1
@entity5 is in effect two movies : one belongs to @entity25 , the other to the rest of the cast			1
@entity24 's drippy in - house recruits include @entity111 as a broke ex- - @entity113 and @entity114 resident ( and the kind of fretful nebbish he perfected on @entity117 in @entity118 ) ; @entity120 a as an uncouth rookie bellhop ; and " @entity19 " 's alumnus @entity119 as an unreliable concierge who happens to be @entity24 's stressed - out brother - in - law			2
( the band of gentlemen credited with the story and screenplay includes @entity129 , who worked on @entity131 's 2001 " @entity130			0
" ) two female characters also join the increasingly frantic male - driven mayhem			0
( here 's where i mention with an eye roll that , in what i hope is a quickly passing trend in male - as well as female - driven comedies , vaginas are briefly discussed , this time by @entity119			2
) @entity141 © a @entity142 , who worked with the director 11 years ago in " @entity144 , " gamely plays a no - nonsense @entity146 agent with cute rough edges			0
and @entity148 , the striking plus - size @entity149 - nominated star of " precious , " makes her @entity70 leap as a feisty @entity153 chambermaid who gets in on the heist action			2
( the girl 's got mad safecracking skills			0
) i do n't know why @entity15 and cinematographer @entity157 felt compelled to push the camera in close , as if gawking at @entity148 's dramatic coloring and size			1
but then , i also do n't know why she was n't used more : @entity25 never looks more alive and excited by a fellow actor -- challenged to peak performance -- than during ribald , flirtatious banter with @entity148 's self - possessed working girl			1
she 's something new ; @entity25 in " @entity5 " is something rebooted			1
together they build something with more visual interest than any @entity114 on any tourist map			0
