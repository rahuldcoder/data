@entity0 -- a member of @entity4 's governing coalition has told @entity1 he expects @entity5 , @entity4 's top diplomat under @entity6 , to be executed next year			1
@entity7 said in an interview in @entity0 : " it will definitely take place , and it will take place after the @entity12 leave @entity4			1
" a lawyer for @entity5 , who served as foreign minister and later deputy prime minister , said he was surprised			1
" i did not expect the government would be that stupid ; by doing this they will drag this country to the edge of the abyss , " said @entity16 in a telephone interview			2
" what about the national reconciliation that this government has been calling for ? the government 's position will be even weaker if they carry out the execution after the @entity12 troops leave the country and this will lead to more conflict among @entity4 factions			1
" a @entity34 official said the execution of @entity5 , like those of other former regime members , will be carried out once the @entity38 ratifies the order and hands it over to the ministry			1
the execution " is not linked and has never been linked to the @entity12 military presence nor to political pressure , " the official said			1
separately , a new law is under consideration that would require death sentences be ratified by the president within 15 days of their being handed down , @entity7 said			1
@entity48 added that all of @entity4 society , including members of the three main sectarian groups -- sunnis , @entity54 and @entity55 -- favor the law			0
@entity5 was captured by @entity12 forces in april 2003 , shortly after the @entity12 - led invasion that toppled @entity6			1
he appeared frail when he testified in @entity6 's 2006 trial on war crimes charges , for which the ousted dictator was hanged later that year			0
@entity5 was sentenced to death in october 2010 by the @entity62 for his role in eliminating religious parties during @entity6 's regime			1
his family was shocked by the verdict , his daughter told @entity1 at the time			0
" my father served his country for more than 22 years			0
he delivered himself to the @entity71 ( after the fall of @entity6 ) because he was n't afraid			0
he did n't do anything wrong			0
he served his country , " @entity5 's daughter , @entity74 , said			2
" he has been wronged			0
" @entity16 said last year that there was a political motive behind the death sentence			0
" mr. @entity5 used to always tell me , ' they 'll find a way to kill me , and there is no way for me to escape this , ' " @entity16 told @entity1			2
" but from a legal perspective , this sentence is wrong ; this is illegal and this is unexpected			0
" @entity5 served as deputy prime minister from 1981 to 2003 , also holding the post of foreign minister for part of that time			2
after the verdict was announced , @entity89 urged @entity4 not to carry out the sentences , even as it acknowledged the brutality of @entity6 's regime			1
" @entity6 's rule was synonymous with executions , torture and other gross human rights violations , and it is right that those who committed crimes are brought to justice , " said @entity94 , @entity89 's director for the @entity95 and @entity96 in 2010			2
" however , it is vital that the death penalty , which is the ultimate denial of human rights , should never be used , whatever the gravity of the crime , " he said in a written statement			0
the @entity112 also opposed the death sentence , spokesman @entity111 told @entity1			1
" this is not the most adequate way to promote reconciliation and reconstruction of justice and peace in a country that has suffered so much , " he said			0
@entity1 's @entity121 and @entity122 contributed to this story			0
