a year after republicans were criticized for playing a major role in the government shutdown , the chairman of the @entity1 gave a big speech thursday in an attempt to tear away at the party 's obstructionist image			1
" people know what we 're against			2
i want to talk about the things we 're for , " @entity12 said thursday at @entity13			1
the speech was part of the @entity18 's rebranding effort following its 2012 presidential election loss , in which @entity18 nominee @entity20 lost to president @entity21 in large part because of his weak standing with minorities , young voters and women			0
@entity12 was critical of the way the party operated nationally in the past , saying the @entity18 had simply become a " u-haul trailer of cash for a presidential nominee " once every four years -- an approach he called a " loser strategy			1
" he stressed that the party needs to be " obsessed over the mechanics " of voter outreach efforts , especially in the data and digital fields			2
" we also have become a midterm party that does n't lose and presidential party that does n't win , " he said , attributing the pattern to a lack of voter engagement and on - the - ground work			1
" there 's something that goes on in presidential elections that we have to get our act together and that 's what we 're going to do , " he continued			0
he ticked off 11 topics that he said are " driving the @entity18 " -- a policy list that included health care , the economy , national security , and immigration			0
@entity12 named a number of @entity1 lawmakers in @entity62 and governors who have proposed or enacted legislation that would address poverty , education and energy			1
among them were sen. @entity69 of @entity70 , sen. @entity71 of @entity72 , sen. @entity73 of @entity74 , and rep. @entity75 of @entity76			0
gov. @entity77 of @entity78 and @entity80 rep. @entity79 , chairwoman of the @entity81			0
" one election wo n't fix everything , but we can take a step in the right direction this november , " he said			0
" if the @entity89 people hire us , we 'll be ready on day one			0
" the @entity90 , which had staffers at the speech , knocked @entity12 ' remarks as simply recycled material			1
" @entity12 just wrapped up his third rebrand speech for the @entity18 ( not to be confused with his earlier rebrand speech or the one before that ) but all we heard was the same old rhetoric that is out of step with reality , " the @entity90 said in an email blast.â € ‹			2
