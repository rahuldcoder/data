@entity0 -- the @entity3 military said thursday that the " vast majority " of @entity5 killed in the recent @entity7 conflict were " terror operatives " and the number of people killed was less than @entity5 sources reported			1
@entity3 says the majority of @entity5 killed during " @entity13 " were " terror operatives			1
" in an e-mailed statement the @entity16 spokesman 's office claimed their figures contained the names of 1,166 palestinians killed in the conflict , called " @entity13			2
" the @entity3 military said 709 of them were " identified as @entity22 terror operatives , among them several from various other terror organizations			1
" the remaining , the statement claims , were comprised of 162 names who " have not yet been attributed to any organization			0
" " furthermore , it has come to our understanding that 295 uninvolved @entity5 were killed during the operation , 89 of them under the age of 16 , and 49 of them were women			2
" the @entity3 military said it was releasing the findings to counter " false information originating from various @entity5 sources , and in order to remove any doubt regarding the number of @entity5 killed in @entity13			1
" the numbers presented by the @entity3 military differ sharply from those reported by @entity5 sources			1
at the conclusion of the fighting , the @entity22 controlled @entity44 in @entity7 had put the death toll at over 1,300 , with the majority made up of non-combatants			1
more recently the @entity48 ( @entity48 ) published a study that put the total death toll at 1,417 , including 926 civilians of which 313 were children under the age of 18 and 116 women			0
it reports that the remainder was made of 255 " non-combatant " police officers and 236 who were took " an active part in hostilities			0
" @entity60 , a deputy director for @entity48 told @entity1 his organization " stands firmly on our published figures " and that @entity3 's choice to classify police officers as combatants is " illegal			0
" " such classification constitutes a willful violation of the principle of ' distinction ' which is a key component of customary international law			0
this raises serious doubts about the accuracy of the figures published by the @entity3 , " he said			0
@entity60 said the civilian death toll included " large numbers of deaths inside people 's homes and other civilian facilities " and that it indicated " the extent to which civilians were intentionally targeted			0
" @entity60 said that until the @entity3 government produced the names and details on which its figures were based that he could not comment further			0
the @entity3 military has maintained that it went to great lengths to minimize civilian deaths and put the responsibility of civilian deaths on @entity22			2
" the @entity22 terror organization placed the primary fighting scene at the heart of civilian neighborhoods as it booby - trapped homes , fired from schools and used civilians as human shields , " the @entity16 said			2
asked about the discrepancy in numbers , an @entity3 military official suggested that natural occurring deaths in @entity7 had been included in the @entity5 death toll numbers and that the total ratio of non-combatant to combatants killed was low			1
a spokesman for the @entity3 military said it could not immediately make the list of killed @entity5 available and could not offer more detail on methodology .			1
