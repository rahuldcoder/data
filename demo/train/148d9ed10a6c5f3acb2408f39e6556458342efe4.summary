you have to love @entity2			1
the 17 - year - old @entity4 advocate for girls ' education who , on friday , became the youngest winner of the @entity8 told " @entity9 's " @entity10 last year what she would do if she were confronted again by a member of the @entity13			1
" i 'll tell him how important education is and that i even want education for your children as well , " she said			2
" i 'll tell him , ' that 's what i want to tell you ; now do what you want			2
' " this from a girl who was shot in the head by the @entity13			1
for exercising her right to go to school			2
@entity2 was only 14 years old at the time -- and just 11 when she started blogging anonymously for the @entity26 about the struggles of life in @entity4 's @entity29			1
@entity10 's response was priceless as well : " i know your father is backstage and he 's very proud of you , but would he be mad if i adopted you ? " it 's not just him			2
the world has adopted @entity2			1
@entity2 's journey from near death to the @entity8 she reminds us of the transformative power of education , especially for the 31 million primary - school - age girls , according to @entity41 , who are n't in school worldwide			1
and , as important , she is a beacon of hope -- a reminder that the human spirit holds in it immense possibility , warmth , humility and forgiveness			0
@entity53 president @entity52 used to fill that role , back when he won the @entity8 in 2009			2
now , as bombs fall over @entity57 and @entity58 , in an attempt to destroy a terrorist group that has beheaded @entity53 , it 's hard to continue to see him that way these days			0
@entity2 is the world 's new symbol of hope			1
her crusade for education rights only seems to be getting stronger as the years pass			0
and in the world of @entity68 and @entity69 , the @entity70 group that kidnaps young girls and attacks their schools , she 's needed now more than ever			0
that she shares the prize with @entity74 , an @entity75 children 's rights activist , makes this moment all the more significant			2
" the @entity79 regards it as an important point for a @entity81 and a @entity82 , an @entity75 and a @entity4 , to join in a common struggle for education and against extremism , " the committee said in a statement			0
the @entity79 praised @entity74 as carrying on @entity87 's tradition of nonviolent resistance			0
and it called @entity2 's struggle " heroic			1
" it 's not hard to see why			0
" dear friends , on the 9th of october 2012 , the @entity13 shot me on the left side of my forehead			1
they shot my friends , too , " @entity2 said at the @entity96 in july 2013			1
" they thought that the bullets would silence us			0
" and then , out of that silence came , thousands of voices			0
the terrorists thought that they would change our aims and stop our ambitions , but nothing changed in my life except this : weakness , fear and hopelessness died			0
strength , power and courage was born			0
" it 's telling that , according to @entity117 , @entity2 was planning to be in school friday			1
it 's the kind that hopefully will give more girls around the world the right to do the same .			0
