ranging in age from 2 to 27 , they are his playmates , his protectors , his teachers and his advocates			2

and they all dread the possible phone call bearing the news that something awful has happened to him			0
@entity19 's a middle child ; he 's 16 , and he has autism			1
living with his parents in @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity19 has limited verbal skills and often wanders away from home and into dangerous situations			1
he has attempted to climb electric towers and expects cars to stop for him if he steps into the street			0

but few people have shared stories about the unique stresses and gifts that autism can bring to sibling relationships			2
@entity2 was diagnosed with less severe autism initially , but as a toddler and preschooler he presented " some of the most severe symptoms i 've seen , " said @entity2			1

he has adaptive skills , and he shows substantial cognitive understanding and can make simple logical connections			0
like many people with autism , @entity2 desires routine and @entity2 also requires moment - by - moment supervision , his sister said , because he sometimes suddenly leaves the house and walks into the street or into neighbors ' yards			2
some of these dynamics are portrayed in tv series like @entity82 's " parenthood " and films such as 1988 's " @entity84 , " where autism poses challenges for brothers and sisters			1
@entity30 , now a special education teacher who works with children on the autism spectrum , recorded a video for @entity35 featuring @entity19 and his brothers and sisters			1

" our vacations , weekends , family dinners -- everything has to be structured to be something he can handle			0
there are many things we just ca n't do as a family			0
" her sister @entity131 -- also a special education teacher -- added , " things many people take for granted , like attending their child 's soccer games , graduations , going out to eat as a family , family vacations and free time on the weekends , are completely centered around @entity2 's needs			2
... we can count on our hands the number of times we have been able to do these activities			0
" the @entity145 offers explanations and solutions to the hurdles that having siblings with the disorder often create			0
@entity30 and her siblings worry about @entity19 's options to achieve a secure and fulfilling lifestyle once he reaches adulthood			1
as @entity19 -- who stands well over 6 feet tall and is still prone to meltdowns -- becomes harder to handle at home , the family hopes to find an arrangement " where he can maintain some form of work and leisure while being kept safe , " but they know " such situations are typically rare and immensely expensive , " said @entity2			1
