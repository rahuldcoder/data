-- last week , while most of the western world was focused on the approaching presidential election in the @entity3 and a potentially disastrous hurricane making landfall in @entity6 , a group of seemingly small nations gathered on the @entity9 and changed the world			1
at the @entity15 in the @entity16 , 16 countries that when combined make up a tiny fraction of the world 's land , came together and made some of the largest ocean commitments in history towards the sustainable management of their oceans , which conversely make up an immense 10 % of the world 's ocean area			1
in the last day of proceedings , @entity3 secretary of state @entity24 , an observer at the forum , pledged to deepen the @entity3 relationship in the region by strengthening its conservation commitment between the @entity31 ( @entity32 ) and the @entity33 ( @entity34 )			2
just before that news broke ; the government of @entity37 announced their intention to establish a 540,500 square mile marine protected area in their portion of the @entity41			1
but the most immediate and groundbreaking announcement came from the host country , the @entity16 that unveiled a brand new marine park			1
at 386,000 square miles , it is equal in size to @entity47 , is half of the nation 's territory , and the largest marine park in the world			1
such a marine park is even more incredible when you consider the relative scale of the commitment ; the @entity16 have a population of only 15,000 people , but an exclusive economic zone half the size of @entity61			1
imagine any other country setting aside a full half of their sovereign territory for conservation , recovery and sustainable development			0
this immense ocean - to - land ratio is shared by most " small island nations " in the @entity33 â € ” which should more accurately be called " large ocean states			1
" this has been a stance and mentality that the leaders in the @entity78 have been cultivating			0
two years ago , the forum leaders recognized the need to create a framework to unite their approach and their voice to manage their vital ocean resources			2
they unanimously agreed upon the concept of the @entity86 , an unprecedented collaborative initiative encompassing nearly 40 million square miles of the @entity88 and its islands			0
the @entity86 hosts the world 's largest remaining stocks of tuna , providing approximately one third of the world 's catch , and is also the region that is first to see the environmental impacts on the ocean			1
the @entity33 people are counting on developed nations to come together to reverse the threats of climate change and rising seas , which are already impacting these low - lying islands and vibrant cultures			1
i have been involved in conservation in this region for more than a decade			0
i first visited the @entity109 with an expeditionary team to survey the islands in 2000 and returned in 2002 to conduct a second survey of the islands			0
the condition of the reefs and the quantities of fish and invertebrates mesmerized us			0
the most remarkable element for me was the large numbers of sharks , indicative of a healthy reef system			0
the experience left me in awe -- and gave us the inspiration to work to protect such a remarkable place			0
in 2006 , i was proud to work with the government of @entity129 to establish the @entity130			0
with @entity132 's support @entity32 was officially declared that year , codified by parliamentary law in 2008 and inscribed as the world 's largest @entity134 in 2009			1
a few years later i joined @entity132 full time and have been able to continue its near two - decade - old efforts to support societies as they move forward on this sustainable development path and to help push forward the expansion of commitments to the @entity86			2
we have been fortunate to work closely with leaders and regional institutions to develop the @entity86 initiative and are proud to have the global marine pioneer and innovator president @entity146 of @entity129 as a member of @entity148			2
we 've also acted as advisors to the development of the @entity153 , the influence of which will be felt far beyond the @entity16			2
the park is the largest commitment ever made to the @entity86 and as such will be a central feature of the framework			0
every year for the past three years the @entity15 has yielded further commitments to the management and protection of the natural resources the @entity33 provides			1
after its close , i can see that the 2012 forum has provided the most ambitious international measures for ocean conservation the world has ever seen			2
i hope the waves of these monumental commitments are felt around the world and inspire other nations and regions towards such great goals			1
i ca n't wait to see how they top it in 2013			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of dr. @entity178			0

@entity15 saw new commitments to ocean protection
@entity16 created marine park the size of @entity47
@entity37 protected its portion of the @entity41
16 @entity33 island nations manage 10 % of world 's oceans
