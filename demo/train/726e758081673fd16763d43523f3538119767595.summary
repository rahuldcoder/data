@entity1 , @entity0 -- like most @entity4 countries , @entity0 has suffered from a severe shortage of nurses and key health workers			1
@entity8 , a nurse at @entity9 , delivers a baby in the maternity ward			0
in the past , workers in the tiny southeast @entity4 nation of just 13 million inhabitants have been lured abroad by the promise of higher wages and better working conditions			0
but , the country best - known as the homeland of @entity21 's adopted children now has another claim to fame : it has succeeding in halting -- at least for now -- its crippling brain drain of nurses			1
@entity0 's solution ? to expand educational opportunities for nurses at all levels and keep them out of poverty by paying modestly more money			1
countries do n't come much poorer than @entity0 , but its healthcare system worked well back in the 1970s and early 1980s			2
when the former @entity40 colony gained independence in 1964 , president @entity36 , himself a physician , maintained a high level of training for nurses that included teaching all classes in @entity47			0
by the late 1990s , however , @entity0 was reeling from the @entity49 epidemic			2
as if that were n't bad enough , the government also had to cut spending on health care and education as a condition for getting help from the @entity57 and other countries to liberalize its trade and economy			0
the publicly funded health system , on which more than 95 percent of @entity0 still depend for treatment , quickly started to fall apart			2
watch a report about the impact of @entity0 's nursing shortage » registered nurses began leaving in droves			1
" every day i received reports from @entity71 that so many nurses are now at the airport , " @entity68 , the former head of nursing services for all @entity0 told @entity2			2
" it was obvious that we needed to do something drastic			0
" @entity68 worked with others in @entity0 's @entity78 ( @entity79 ) to come up with an emergency plan that focused on nurses as they provided most of the primary care			1
the @entity79 then applied for around $ 160 million ( £ 100 million ) in international funding for their six - year initiative , primarily from the @entity85 of the @entity40			0
the money was to be used to pay higher salaries to nurses -- quite a radical move in global development as donors worry it is unsustainable in the long haul			0
however , the situation in @entity0 was getting desperate			2
the gamble paid off : the number of registered nurses leaving @entity0 fell from a high of 111 ( the equivalent of two years of @entity0 's entire nursing graduates ) in 2001 to just six in the first half of 2008			1
enrollment at @entity0 's nursing schools jumped up by 50 percent			1
success in one area has revealed a different problem -- that of an internal brain drain			1
as more international aid groups and universities set up health programs in @entity0 , they are hiring nurses , all trained at @entity0 taxpayer expense , away from publicly funded hospitals and clinics			2
the problem is even more acute in the rural areas , where most of @entity0 's people live			1
@entity9 in northern @entity0 has a good reputation but is located at the end of a long , dusty road , far from major towns , let alone cities			0
" @entity128 nurses with families do not really want to work here , " said @entity124 , head of nursing at @entity126			0
" the local market is very small and although the hospital has running water , that is not the case in many homes			0
" even so , the hospital has made impressive strides in the past five years preserving mothers ' lives during pregnancy , as well as cutting the number of deaths due to malaria among children and adults			0
and that is perhaps the most important lesson to draw from @entity0 's efforts : it pays to look at how much has been accomplished with so little .			1

@entity0 's *innovative* national program lifts nurses out of poverty
since 2001 the external brain drain has *slowed* to a *trickle*
many *challenges* still *remain* as the public health service is depleted
