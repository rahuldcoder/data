, we thought we 'd acknowledge a few other ways you can travel ' with the stars ' -- by going to their own shops , restaurants or private islands			1
here 's a sample : hotels and villas @entity18 : @entity20 ( @entity19 , @entity21 ) for beach - time luxury , @entity18 really does home here -- it 's just one of a series of celeb - studded three - bedroom villas with big sundecks , private pool and butler service in the @entity21 that start at $ 10 million if you 're looking to buy			1
to rent , it runs $ 8100 a week in peak season , but $ 4500 from june through october			2
@entity34 of the b - 52s : @entity36 ( @entity37 , @entity38 ) far far far more economical -- and funky -- is @entity34 of the @entity40 boutique hotel , a renovated ' 50s cabin complex a couple hours from @entity38 in the @entity42			2
rates start at $ 175 a night			2
each cabin was decorated by the artists who lent their colorful home for the @entity40 's ' @entity48 ' video , and there are ' 50s - era @entity50 to rent out too			2
there 's nearby streams , hiking trails and towns to explore			2
@entity56 : countries that can still be traveled on the cheap @entity59 : @entity60 ( @entity61 , @entity62 ) most equate @entity61 with former mayor @entity63 , but @entity64 calls it home too			1
@entity66 , terra - cotta hallways give a @entity67 feel to this historic hotel , open since 1929			2
and @entity59 ' seriously pet - tastic rules ( quote open to canine guests ) is quite , um , ' que sera sera ' too			1
@entity63 : @entity71 ( @entity61 , @entity62 ) speaking of @entity63 , his @entity61 ranch features a complex of 1850s buildings spread across sea - facing fields in @entity61 too			1
there 's some surprising deals from $ 135 a night for a room in the ranch house			2
@entity81 : @entity82 ( @entity83 & others ) @entity81 's not just in it for the tourist dough , he steps in to help rebuild communities			0
highly regarded resorts like @entity90 , @entity83 's @entity91 are made from hurricane - wrecked predecessors transformed into a dose of paradise , with nice beaches and diving opportunities			0
summer rates start at $ 285			0
@entity56 : 20 free attractions in @entity98 restaurants and bars we all know about @entity104 's @entity103 sushi franchise ( seriously , he 's even opened one in the world 's most remote @entity107 - speaking city , @entity109 ) , so we 've focused on a few you might have missed : @entity111 of @entity112 : @entity113 ( @entity114 , @entity62 ) the recently opened second rock'n'roll themed @entity116 -- named for a @entity118 song -- is set next to the historic @entity119 in @entity114 's rising ' @entity121 ' neighborhood , which was pretty much a ghost town a few years ago			1
makes sense to co-owner @entity111 ( @entity112 's bassist ) , who was born in town			0
it 's a bit of a ' 50s throw - back , with thematic dolls and a hearty gamut of diner fare			1
@entity129 : @entity130 ( @entity131 , @entity132 ) near the fabled crossroads -- down on @entity134 , where @entity135 supposedly sold his soul for guitar prowess -- @entity131 is a slightly worn @entity139 town with a heavy dose of blues and barbecue			1
( april 's @entity144 festival is a sidewalk - spiller scene of ribs and blues bands ; unreal )			1
the town 's focal point , right by the tracks , is the paint - peeling brick building known as @entity130 , a blues bar co-owned by @entity129			1
it 's only 10 , but looks 80 -- in all the right ways			0
@entity156 : @entity158 ( @entity157 & @entity159 , @entity62 ; @entity160 , @entity161 ) the @entity163 - winning guitarist named his mini chain ( four locations ) of modern @entity167 fare after his hit song			1
food makes regulars forget any celeb connection , though if they look closely at the artist signature they can remember ( @entity156 ' art decorates the walls )			1
shops and clubs @entity177 : @entity178 ( @entity179 ) @entity180 -- of @entity181 ( and ' @entity182 ' let 's not forget ) fame -- opened this record shop in @entity179 a couple years ago			1
he wo n't likely be manning the register when you go by , but it 's clearly a business true to his unique aesthetic and something he means			0
it recently starred on the @entity194 tv show , the @entity193 , where the mock - conservative talking head recorded with the label 's band @entity196			0
( see @entity177 hold his own with @entity198			0
) @entity199 : 826 @entity200 ( @entity201 ) eclectic author , the guy behind the ever - artful @entity204 's literary journal , created this not - for - profit writing center / shop to inspire youth to write in @entity201 's @entity208			0
it 's also a shop , famed for its pirate supplies for the ' working buccaneer			0
' when all else fails , what 's wrong with a little fun and a lot of inspiration ? see @entity199 talk , nervously , on how he started it for @entity218			0
@entity219 : @entity220 ( @entity38 ) she does n't know how to play ping pong , or really care to learn , but sees her ownership role of the star - studded ping - pong club in @entity225 as something like ' @entity227 ' from the tv show gunsmoke			1
why though ? she said , after getting beaten in @entity229 , she likes any sport where a little girl can beat a tough guy			0
it 's as much playing as , the site confesses , drinking or people - watching			0
the catch is to play you must apply for membership -- starting at $ 65 a month ( the application requires self - evaluation at ping - pong skills , a seven - tiered rating from ' embarrassing ' to ' professional ' )			0
@entity244 : @entity245 ( @entity246 , @entity247 ) in @entity248 on @entity246 -- the town that still makes boats , true to the island salty past -- @entity244 co-owns the shop @entity245 , a precious little shop that covers most bases : wall art , sundresses , hand creams , books , and signed copies of @entity260 ( her music always makes the website )			0
