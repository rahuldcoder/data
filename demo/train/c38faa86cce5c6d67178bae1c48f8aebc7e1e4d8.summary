@entity0 @entity2 has lived in @entity0 for nine years and still does n't feel like she belongs			1
but that changes every time she reaches for her camera			0
@entity2 , 27 , is a migrant domestic worker or " helper " who moonlights as a photographer			1
she spends six days a week cooking , cleaning and babysitting for an affluent @entity11 family			0
on her day off , @entity2 wanders around the city capturing black and white scenes			1
" when i 'm wearing my camera i 'm not a helper anymore , i 'm an ordinary girl			0
" it 's a way of protection because when you 're a helper here , there is a kind of stereotyping that they do , " referring to @entity24			0
lately , @entity2 has been documenting a group of women at @entity27 , a shelter for abused migrant workers			2
" when i see the girls , i talk to them , i absorb all their emotions and i ca n't really believe that some people can do that to other human beings , " @entity2 says			2
" we 're the same			0
but i have a boss that treats me with respect and like a human being but these people â€” they were treated badly			0
" @entity2 dropped out of college in the @entity43 to work as a maid when she was only 19 so her younger brother and sister could stay at school			1
she began shooting street scenes four years ago , after asking her boss for a loan to buy a @entity52 dslr camera			2
@entity2 's outsider status helps her to capture the city differently			1
she often peers at her subjects through a glass window or mirror and plays with lighting to create dramatic , melancholic contrasts			0
she posts new images on @entity60 or her blog almost daily			0
that 's how she caught the attention of @entity43 documentary photographer @entity64 who introduced her to a community of mentors			1
soon after , doors began to open -- first , a profile in the @entity71 ' @entity70 blog , then a @entity73 sponsorship and an exhibition at the @entity43 consulate general in @entity0			1
in december , @entity2 walked into the @entity76 in @entity0 where her prints were hanging in 20 x 29 inch frames against a yellow , brick wall			2
it 's easy to see why @entity2 gets mistaken for a tourist or just another 20 - something visitor on the streets of @entity0			1
she sports a blue hoodie , braces and side - swept bangs			0
it 's @entity2 's second solo exhibit in a year but the first time she had seen her images enlarged			1
as she approached the back wall , @entity2 could n't quite hide the thrill of seeing her photos displayed			2
she pulled out her smartphone and snapped a picture of the gallery to send to her mom and @entity98 more : taking a different look at photography			0
