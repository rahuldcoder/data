@entity0 -- president @entity2 on friday outlined steps to reform @entity5 intelligence gathering measures after they came under scrutiny following their revelation by former @entity10 contractor @entity8 , saying the classified leaks created a public distrust in programs meant to safeguard @entity5			1
since @entity8 leaked secret documents to the media , critics have called the @entity10 's domestic surveillance -- including a program that monitors the metadata of domestic phone calls -- a government overreach			2
many of those same critics have asked the @entity2 administration and @entity25 to rein in the programs			1
" given the history of abuse by governments , it 's right to ask questions about surveillance , particularly as technology is reshaping every aspect of our lives , " @entity2 said during a news conference in the @entity28 of the @entity29			1
documents shed light on @entity5 surveillance programs but the president slammed the release of the information that has " come out in dribs and drabs , " saying a general impression has taken hold " that we are somehow out there willy - nilly sucking information from everybody			2
" at the same time , @entity2 sought to assure the public that there are safeguards in place , while acknowledging the need for transparency			1
among the steps being taken , according to the president : working with @entity25 to pursue appropriate improvements of the telephone data program ; reforming the secret court that approves that initiative ; improving transparency to provide as much information as possible to the public , including the legal rationale for government collection activities ; and appointing a high - level , independent group of outside experts to review surveillance technologies			1
" there 's no doubt mr. @entity8 's leaks triggered a much more rapid and passionate response than if i had simply appointed this review board , " the president said			0
@entity8 's e-mail provider shuts down amid court battle ' take a pause ' but @entity2 refused any characterization of @entity8 as a " whistle - blower " or " patriot , " saying there were " other avenues " the former @entity10 contractor could have taken instead of leaking national security surveillance information			1
@entity8 , who has been granted temporary asylum in @entity91 , has been charged with three felony counts related to the leaks , including violations of the @entity5 @entity95			1
if @entity8 believes his actions were right , " he can appear before a court with a lawyer and make his case , " the president said			0
@entity8 was granted temporary asylum in @entity91 , a move that further strained already tense relations between @entity0 and @entity103			1
@entity2 said that his decision to not go to @entity103 next month for a summit was not solely related to @entity91 's decision to grant asylum to @entity8			1
he said the @entity5 must " take a pause " and " calibrate the relationship " with @entity91 to assess where things stand , while " recognizing there are going to be some differences and we are not always going to agree			1
" @entity2 cancels talks with @entity114 ahead of @entity116 summit relations between @entity2 and @entity91 president @entity114 have foundered over a number of issues , including their sharp differences over @entity121 , missile defense and , most recently , a new anti-gay law signed by @entity114 that could put gay and lesbian athletes at risk of arrest in next year 's winter @entity127 in @entity128 , @entity91			1
since @entity114 's election as president , @entity2 believes there has been a return to some @entity134 attitudes with " more rhetoric on the @entity91 side that was anti-american			1
" " i 've encouraged mr. @entity114 to think forward as opposed to backwards on those issues with mixed success , " the president said			0
' no @entity127 boycott ' @entity2 rejected calls to boycott the @entity142 unless the law is repealed , saying it would hurt @entity5 athletes who have trained and sacrificed to make it to the @entity127			1
" one of the things i 'm really looking forward to is maybe some gay and lesbian athletes bringing home the gold or silver or bronze , which i think would go a long way in rejecting the kind of attitudes that we 're seeing there , " @entity2 said			1
" if @entity91 does n't have gay or lesbian athletes , then that would probably make their team weaker			1
" it had been more than three month since the president took questions from reporters in the @entity29 briefing room , and much has transpired since then , including the recent closing embassies in @entity169 , the @entity170 and @entity171 because of a heightened terror threat			0
if he headed out to his @entity177 vacation this weekend without addressing the issues , " it would be seen as a mistake , " said @entity173 , @entity1 's chief political correspondent			0
" the most immediate topic , i think , on his plate , has got to be what 's going on in terms of terrorism and the closing of the embassies			0
" last week , officials shuttered 22 @entity5 embassies and consulates for the day on sunday amid fears of an @entity192 attack			0
on sunday afternoon , the @entity193 said it had extended embassy and consulate closures in 15 of the locations until friday and later added four other posts to the list			0
the decision was seen as unprecedented from many in the diplomacy and intelligence communities			0
a senior state department official said friday that the majority of those posts will reopen on sunday			0
@entity192 threat on friday , @entity2 declined to answer questions about reported @entity5 drone strikes against militants in @entity210 in recent weeks that have left at least 34 people dead , saying he would not discuss operations			2
the core leadership of @entity192 has been decimated , but the terror group 's offshoots -- such as @entity217 operating in @entity210 -- still possess the ability to threaten @entity5 embassies and businesses			0
" we are not going to completely eliminate terrorism			0
what we can do is weaken it and strengthen our partnerships " so it can not pose the type of threat seen on 9/11 , he said			0
@entity2 's administration has been under fire in recent months over its response to the attack on a @entity5 diplomatic compound in @entity235 , @entity236 , that left @entity5 ambassador @entity237 and three other @entity5 dead			2
asked why @entity2 has not made good on a promise to get those responsible for the september 2012 attack , he said : " i also said we would get @entity241 , and i did n't get him in 11 months			2
" a sealed federal indictment has been issued in the @entity235 case , and " it 's sealed for a reason , " @entity2 said			2
@entity245 , health care among the other issues @entity2 discussed during the news conference : -- immigration : @entity2 believes there are enough votes in the @entity29 to pass a @entity253 immigration reform bill , which would allow undocumented immigrants an opportunity to become @entity5 citizens			1
the bill also increases border security and penalties for employers who knowingly hire people not authorized to work in the @entity5			0
" i 'm absolutely confident that if the bill was on the floor of the @entity29 , it would pass , " he said			0
@entity29 leaders have refused to take up the bill , saying it will not solve the immigration problem			0
instead , they have proposed a series of issue - oriented bills , such as border security			0
" i do n't know a law that solves a problem 100 % , " @entity2 said			2
opinion : crunch time for immigration , budget fights -- health care : @entity2 warned against a @entity281 threats to shut down the government if it ca n't defund the president 's health care law , saying it was a bad idea			1
" the idea that you would shut down the government unless you prevent 30 million people from getting health care is a bad idea , " @entity2 said			2
meanwhile , @entity2 said the decision to delay for a year a portion of the health care law known as the " shared responsibility payment , " which requires businesses of a certain size to pay a fine if they fail provide health insurance , was drawing criticism because of the politicization of the issue			2
" in implementing the @entity307 , there are going to be some glitches , " @entity2 said , adding the were the same kind of obstacles that the government ran into when the country was adopting @entity304 and @entity305			2
" ... that 's true of a car company rolling out a new car			0
that 's true of @entity313 rolling out a new @entity314			0
" -- @entity315 chair : the president said @entity318 and @entity319 were both highly qualified to be the next chair of the @entity315 , but said there were " a range " of candiates for the job			1
the term for @entity326 , the current @entity315 chair , ends in 2014 , and @entity2 said he will make a decision about who will replace @entity326 in the fall			1
@entity1 's @entity330 , @entity331 and @entity333 's @entity332 contributed to this report .			0
