-- @entity1 was to the point			1
@entity3 went on and on			1
@entity4 did it as if he were writing an employee 's job review			1
" @entity13 may walk among us , but that does n't mean evil never wrote a love letter , " said @entity8 , an author who has plundered the depths of cheesy writing throughout history by revered , infamous and just plain awful people			1
his book " @entity19 " is mostly filled with leaders acting honorably			1
but it also features several who had an affection for tyranny			1
" i found that almost all powerful people are very passionate , and that naturally can make them over the top in their personal lives , " @entity8 said			1
" another truth i learned , " the author said , " is that it 's never a good idea to hook up with a dictator			1
" nadya @entity1 's family sheltered @entity1 after one of his escapes from @entity37 exile during 1911 , and the two reconnected later when she worked as a clerk in @entity41 's office			1
their romance began when she was a teenager			1
when they married in 1919 , he was 41			1
they had a boy , @entity47 , and a girl , @entity48			1
it 's unclear exactly what the brown - eyed young woman saw in the stout and swarthy older man			1
perhaps she developed an attachment to him when she was a child , or maybe it was because she too was a diehard @entity56			1
like @entity1 , she had an unpredictable temper and exceptionally bold political ambitions , especially for a woman of her time , rising up eventually through party ranks to pull her own weight			1
while historians describe her as conservative in dress and manner -- at least publicly -- @entity1 wore his heart on his sleeve for his wife			1
in june 1930 , @entity1 was busy revamping the @entity70 's economy , which led to millions of people being deported and exiled and a catastrophic famine			2
his plans would later lead to the slaughter of millions			2
he wrote to his wife , using his pet name for her , while she was away having her headaches treated in @entity78			1
" i miss you so much @entity80			1
... i 'm as lonely as a horned owl			1
" the dictator did n't discuss his job in letters to his wife , @entity8 said			1
" i 'm not going out of town on business , " @entity1 wrote			1
" i 'm just finishing up my work and then i 'm going to go out of town to the children tomorrow ... so goodbye , do n't be too long , come home sooner ! my kisses ! your @entity1			1
" she replied to him by writing , " i am kissing you passionately			2
" while @entity1 's letters were lengthy in the beginning of their courtship , he sometimes wrote the equivalent of a refrigerator post-it to his wife			1
" i forgot to send the money , but i 've now sent it ( 120 roubles ) with colleagues leaving today , " he wrote			2
" kiss you , @entity1			2
" their correspondence flew back and forth quickly , carried by secret police couriers , writes historian @entity107 , author of " @entity1 : the court of the @entity109			2
" @entity110 and @entity1 were an explosive match , both quick to anger and not afraid to snap at each other at dinner parties			2
in 1926 , she took the kids to @entity119 and he begged her to come back , so she did			2
" both were selfish , cold with fiery tempers , though she had none of his cruelty and duplicity , " @entity107 wrote			2
the two fought one night at a party			2
she ended up dead by dawn of an apparent self - inflicted gunshot wound			2
@entity130 officials told the public she died of illness			2
some people believe @entity1 killed her			2
loving @entity135 ended similarly for @entity136 , a beautician who some sources say was his first wife			1
the @entity140 tyrant ordered her and their son , @entity141 , institutionalized			2
but in the beginning , it was all kisses and sweetness			2
he called her " my little friend " and signed a letter " your wild friend and lover			1
" " my little @entity136 , " he wrote , " i have just arrived after twelve endless hours on a train that left me completely covered in soot			2
i washed it off as best as i could and my first thought , even before going to dinner , is you			2
are you pleased ? will you say , once again , that you alone love me , while i do n't love you ? i love you too , my dear @entity136 , even though i have n't been able to prove it to you			1
" another letter : " how happy i would have been to have you with me , today , while the train was racing along under a cloudless sky , through a countryside displaying all of autumn 's melancholic seduction , towards this beautiful @entity164 which appeared before me just as the sunset was setting ablaze the horizon of the seven hills of the @entity164			2
" " when they met , he was pretty much a nobody , enlisting and heading off to @entity169 , " said @entity8			2
" after the war , his career takes off			0
he has his minions declare her insane , locks her and her son up and she dies			0
" @entity176 was much more in control of her relationship with @entity3 , a notoriously temperamental military commander			0
@entity8 said that the @entity180 emperor seemed to perform better in battle when @entity176 returned his smothering affection			0
" she wore the pants , " the author said			0
" he was completely in love and obsessed with her			1
" shortly after they were married , @entity3 left to command the @entity180 army near @entity140			0
much of his correspondence to @entity176 bordered on begging , particularly in april 1796			0
he wanted her to join him closer to battle so they could have a honeymoon			0
" i have your letters of the 16th and 21st			0
there are many days when you do n't write			0
what do you do , then ? no , my darling , i am not jealous , but sometimes worried			0
come soon ; i warn you , if you delay , you will find me ill. fatigue and your absence are too much			0
" " your letters are the joy of my days , and my days of happiness are not many , " he writes , saying that he 's racked with " hopeless sorrow , inconsolable misery , sadness without end			0
" " but you are coming , are n't you ? you are going to be here beside me , in my arms , on my breast , on my mouth ? take wing and come , come ! a kiss on your heart , and one much lower down , much lower ! " @entity3 appears to have written multiple letters on the same day , like a guy who leaves a half dozen increasingly desperate voice mails back to back			0
" i am going to bed with my heart full of your adorable image			0
... i can not wait to give you proofs of my ardent love , " he writes in november 1796			1
" ... how happy i would be if i could assist you at your undressing , the little firm white breast , the adorable face , the hair tied up in a scarf a la creole			1
you know that i will never forget the little visits , you know , the little black forest			0
... i kiss it a thousand times and wait impatiently for the moment i will be in it			1
to live within @entity176 is to live in the @entity242			0
kisses on your mouth , your eyes , your breast , everywhere , everywhere			0
" most of @entity3 's letters were flowery , as were those of the many other leaders in @entity8 's book			1
" almost everyone was descriptive and seemed to put a lot of care into what they wrote , " he said			0
" @entity256 met @entity4 in @entity257 when she was a teenager			1
by every standard , @entity256 had a terrible experience			1
she tried to kill herself twice during their relationship			0
she was married to the @entity262 for only 40 hours before she bit a capsule of cyanide in his bunker and they both died there in april 1945			0
there are no surviving letters between the two			0
but there are accounts , @entity8 said , of what @entity4 said about @entity256 to his inner circle			1
@entity256 had a " calm , intelligent and objective way of being , " @entity4 remarked			1
" there 's a coldness , like he 's evaluating her , " said @entity8			0
" perhaps the only control @entity3 had over @entity176 was that he gave her that name			0
her real name was @entity283			0
and @entity283 lost interest in her @entity180 fighter not long after they married			0
during the @entity290 , according to a @entity289 documentary , rumors reached @entity3 that @entity176 was cheating on him			0
when he returned to her home in @entity292 , she was n't there			0
historians believe she might have taken off with her lover			0
@entity3 waited for nine days for her to come back and wrote , " i do n't love you anymore ; on the contrary , i detest you			1
you are a vile , mean , beastly slut			0
" no couples therapy could help them			0
@entity3 grew resentful and took a lover -- and kept taking them -- while @entity176 came back to him and tried to persuade him to stay with her			0
but his ego was trampled and he divorced her , claiming that that was best for @entity180			0

stalin to his wife : " i miss you . ... i 'm as lonely as a horned owl "
@entity135 to his beloved : " will you say , once again , that you alone love me ? "
