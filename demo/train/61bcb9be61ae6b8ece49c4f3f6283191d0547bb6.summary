@entity0 , @entity1 anti-islam protesters gathered monday in the @entity1 city of @entity0 , with some carrying banners with the names of those killed in the @entity9 attack in @entity10			1
it is the 12th march in @entity0 called by the protest group @entity13 against the @entity14 , or @entity15 , since october			1
@entity0 police say the number of people attending these rallies has increased from an estimated 350 protesters on october 20 to 18,000 on january 5 and 25,000 people on monday			1
the @entity15 movement emerged last year in the eastern @entity1 city			2
about 2 % of @entity0 's inhabitants are foreigners			1
on its @entity27 page , @entity15 says citizens should " wake from their slumber " and recognize the " danger in the @entity34 ideology			2
" " stop the radical @entity36 ' @entity35 , " it urges			2
" as a society , we should give people the chance to integrate , but we should not allow ourselves to be islamized thereby losing our freedom and democracy ! " the group claims to have supporters in more than 30 @entity1 cities and 18 countries in @entity47			1
a @entity15 group in @entity49 has also called for demonstrators to gather outside the @entity51 in the capital , @entity53 , to show support for the @entity55 and demonstrate opposition to what it calls the " @entity35 of @entity49			2
" in @entity0 , organizers earlier announced that monday 's rally would commemorate the victims of last week 's attacks in @entity10			1
critics , however , say that protesters are taking advantage of the attacks to attract supporters and incite hatred against refugees and foreigners			1
@entity1 justice minister @entity70 called upon the organizers to cancel the protests			2
in an interview with @entity1 newspaper @entity73 , he said , " the victims do not deserve to be abused by such agitators			1
" the head of @entity1 's @entity78 party , @entity79 , told @entity80 : " i want to request those responsible ... that they cancel their demonstrations for the foreseeable future , especially at a time when the whole world is shocked about the events in @entity10			2
" @entity1 chancellor @entity88 , who has repeatedly voiced her disagreement with the @entity15 movement in recent weeks , made similar demands			2
a representative for @entity15 in @entity0 told @entity2 that the march would not be canceled			1
" they are putting us on the same level as radical extremists , " said @entity94 , one of @entity15 's leaders			2
" we have the right to express our condolences to the victims of friday 's terror attack			1
" @entity94 added : " we all think we are being neglected by our politicians			0
" she later told @entity2 that she does not want to be perceived as racist			0
" @entity106 are only a tiny fraction of the population , but they 're so dominant in pushing for their demands that @entity1 culture is being pushed back , " said @entity94			0
" we want to live peacefully with all immigrants here in @entity1 , but we as @entity1 demand that they assimilate themselves into our culture and that they live in accordance with our laws and do n't build up parallel societies			0
" at a planned protest in nearby @entity118 -- organized by a group similar to @entity15 -- protest organizers had agreed to a city ban on showing @entity122 cartoons , but city authorities revoked their ban monday following criticism that it limited free speech			0
according to @entity1 wire service @entity128 , @entity118 city officials originally made the decision to ensure that the protests would remain peaceful			0
" after @entity10 , one must assume that @entity135 cartoons are meant to be a provocation , " @entity128 quoted a city representative before the ban was revoked			0
@entity55 cartoonists reacted to the @entity1 pegida marches by publishing caricatures in which they ridiculed the protesters			1
on saturday , 35,000 people assembled in front of @entity0 's landmark site , the @entity144 , to advocate for tolerance			1
local politicians emphasized that they were open for a dialogue with @entity15 protesters			1
@entity149 against @entity151 demonstrators were planned in @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity0 , @entity118 and @entity156			1
on its @entity27 page , the leftist group @entity157 ( @entity0 free of @entity158 ) called upon its supporters to protest against the @entity162 demonstrators			1
the @entity157 organizers wrote : " it is your decision to decide whether there will only be protests in hearing range and sight distance or whether we will try to do more			0
" large numbers of police officers will try to keep @entity162 protesters and their opponents from clashing , with a heavier presence because of the @entity10 attacks			1
" we have slightly increased the number of police officers involved , " a police representative told @entity2 on monday , refusing to give specific numbers ahead of the demonstration			1
later , police said that around 1,600 officers were involved on monday			1
some 8,700 people protested against @entity15 in @entity0 , according to police			1
a poll by @entity1 newspaper @entity187 in december found that 34 % of respondents believed their country was becoming " increasingly islamicized			0
" @entity1 interior minister @entity190 told @entity2 's @entity191 last week that he was " worried by this tendency " but that the significance of the protests should not be overestimated			0
" it 's new , it 's concerning , but we should not be dominated by @entity15 when we discuss our political agenda , " he said			0
on the other hand , he said protesters posed some questions that needed to be answered			1
" they ask : ' is there an end of asylum seekers , how dangerous is @entity34 for our society , what about the fight against @entity210 ( @entity211 ) -- can this be successful ? ' these critical questions have to be faced , have to be answered , " de @entity202 said			0
but he said he did not fear a rise of ugly nationalism in @entity1 again			0
" i 'm confident we are strong , " he said			0
" we learned our lessons from the @entity217 years , and you can see it 's very interesting that the organizations of @entity15 ; they know exactly where the red line is which they should not cross -- this makes me more skeptical but they know where the taboos are in @entity1 so i do n't see a renewal of the @entity225 ( the far - right @entity225 ) -- it 's less than in other @entity47 countries			0
and we are very well aware of it , and we will fight against every tendency			0
" @entity229 , a @entity47 analyst with the @entity230 , told @entity2 that the @entity15 movement had really only gained traction in the @entity0 area , where its ideas had fallen on " particularly fertile soil			1
" " these protests are not so much fueled by fear of @entity34 and fear of @entity240 attacks , but by frustration at the cost of reunification -- about the way they are being integrated and represented since the fall of the @entity247 , " @entity229 said			0
@entity0 already had a well - established network of right - wing extremists before @entity15 's emergence , he said			1
" it 's more a case of @entity253 not entirely feeling at home in @entity1 , " @entity229 said			0
" there is a feeling of second - class citizenship , and in order to be heard , many @entity253 take to radical measures			0
" the movement was " basically a plea for more attention more than anything else , " he said			0
" i think this movement has peaked -- i do n't think that there is much more of a local and regional potential that this movement can exploit			0
" @entity229 stressed that there was a substantial counterprotest movement , with those protesters outnumbering @entity15 supporters last week in @entity273 by 10 - to - 1			2
in fact , across @entity1 on monday , more than 80,000 people protested against @entity15 , according to the news agency @entity128			2
in her @entity278 's speech , @entity88 addressed the issue of xenophobia , saying such demonstrations encourage the exclusion of people because of their skin color or religion			2
@entity88 urged people not to attend such rallies , where people have " hatred in their hearts , " she said			1
" we know the value of unity in our country , " she said			0
" it is the foundation of our success			0
" @entity2 's @entity299 also contributed to this report .			0

police estimate that some 25,000 people attended the march
