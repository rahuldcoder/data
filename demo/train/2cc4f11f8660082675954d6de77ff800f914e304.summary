-- this saturday night , while you 're watching @entity3 brood in " @entity4 " or catching up on " @entity5 " -- or doing something besides staring at a glowing rectangle -- a certain flame - haired actress will be dining with @entity10 's commander - in - chief			2
that 's right : @entity12 , newly minted @entity13 movie star , will attend 2012 ′ s @entity15 ' dinner			1
her rep tells the @entity17 that @entity12 is going to be a guest of @entity20 host @entity19 , who must be a closet fan of " @entity22			1
" and to make matters even odder , @entity12 's defense attorney @entity23 will also be present at the soiree			1
i guess that 'll come in handy if another lady accuses her of battery afterward			0
it 's bizarre that @entity12 's going to rub elbows with @entity33 , @entity34 , and a roster of @entity37 insiders and @entity39 a-listers at the event			1
but ever since famous residents of the @entity44 started attending the @entity45 in greater numbers , the event 's guest list has included more than a few head scratchers			0
for example : - in 2002 , bat - biter @entity49 attended and evidently stole the show from then - president @entity52			1
( hey , remember when the @entity53 was a thing ? ) @entity52 tried to get the last laugh by telling @entity49 that @entity56 was a big fan of albums like " @entity58			1
" - 2006 welcomed " @entity64 " winner @entity60 and tennis siren @entity61 , among others			2
but i 'm guessing nobody had time to wonder why these c - listers were in the building ; guests must have been too busy gaping at @entity71 's explosive speech			0
- 2008 : @entity72 got an invite , but had to cancel when human sweat stain @entity74 demanded a ticket as well			0
what a loss for @entity78 ! - @entity79 showed up in 2009 and allegedly snorted cocaine in front of president @entity82			1
which decision was worse : doing drugs while surrounded by secret service agents or appearing in " @entity86 : the @entity87 ? " - 2010 was a banner year for unlikely @entity45 attendees			0
the @entity89 , @entity91 's sister @entity90 , @entity92 ( @entity93 's ex-wife ) , and q - list syndicated talk show host @entity96 all came			0
oh , and so did @entity97 ; like @entity12 , she was a guest of @entity98			2
( so , in fact , was @entity49			2
i 'm shocked she did n't try to bring @entity102 in 2011			0
) - this year , @entity12 may be upstaged by another headline - grabbing guest : @entity105 , @entity107 's adorable , heroic @entity106			1
he 'll be a guest of the @entity108 , a paper that knows from dog puns			0
how do you think @entity12 compares to those who have come before her ? and what do you think she 'll do at the @entity114 -- accidentally flash her mean girl ? pick a fight with @entity117 , a repeat attendee ? or surprise us all by acting normal and having a lovely time ? see the full article at @entity0			2
