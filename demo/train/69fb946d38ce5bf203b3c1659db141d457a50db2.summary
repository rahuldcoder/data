-- in her new , already much - discussed book , @entity2 coo @entity1 argues we need to " lean in " more to our careers			1
we need to ask for flexibility even when the thought of doing so scares us , say yes to the promotions and the big projects , and radiate our own worthiness at cocktail parties just like the @entity13 boys			1
but to prevent falling flat on our faces from all that forward momentum , we also need to learn to " lean out " in other areas of our lives			1
too many women might let their employers off the hook , shying away from salary negotiation or accepting policies that prevent working mothers from thriving , but more still never let themselves off the hook			2
opinion : why women must seize this moment it 's time that women wave the white flag of surrender over our own messy , beautiful lives			2
we must accept imperfection -- physical , domestic , social -- and strive , instead , to be whole , bold , interesting			1
we must embrace psychologist @entity35 's decades - old idea of the " good enough mother			2
" at the @entity39 last week , surrounded by uberachievers , i was chatting with a superstar organizational leader in the hallways , and she told me that it was her 4 - year - old daughter 's birthday			1
" it must be hard not to be with her			2
it 's such a special day ! " i said			2
" not really , " she immediately responded			2
" we all turned 4 -- it 's not that special			2
there will be plenty more birthdays , and she 's having a great day with her dad			0
" photos : the historical analogs of brilliant women i was stunned			0
regardless of what you think about her nonchalance , you have to admire this woman 's capacity to shed the preciousness of motherhood so publicly			1
in this little exchange , she was boldly " leaning out " of the gender - based expectation that she would be tortured about missing her daughter 's birthday			1
instead , she owned that she , in fact , was excited to be at a conference that promised to boost her own career			0
the bonus : her husband had an opportunity to strengthen his bond and build more memories with his daughter			0
another recent , and rare , sighting of a woman " leaning out " : a couple of weeks ago , i was sitting around a coffee table , eating @entity86 takeout with a circle of women in their 20s and 30s			0
another high - achieving friend showed us a photo of her young son , sitting on a hospital bed , smiling enthusiastically while holding out a big thumbs up			0
turns out that while she was away on a business trip , he 'd fallen out of a tree and had to go to the hospital			0
the bowl - haired little boy had asked his father to snap this photo with his iphone to send to his mom so she could see how brave he had been , even and especially without her			0
the myth of balancing motherhood and a successful career instead of " leaning in " to guilt that she had n't been there to supervise his stitches , she " leaned out " with a proud smile ; her son was already learning the power of resilience			1
so yes , part of the revolution is asking for what we 're worth at work , but part of it is also not overestimating our worth at home			1
we must give ourselves permission to be less responsible in the parts of our life that women have micromanaged for decades -- the dishes , the carpool and even the thank - you notes			1
too often , we want our friends , our family , our employers to all consider us infallible and " good , " what author @entity139 calls the " curse of the good girl			0
" work and family : how do you and your partner make it work ? instead , we need to sharpen our serenity , cut through the guilt and the expectations and the perfection and accept when we just ca n't live up to our own or others ' expectations of perfection			1
we need to practice big , radical shrugs : the all - too - rare and oh - so - powerful , " oh well , " of a woman who has accepted that she could n't be everywhere at once or be everything to everybody			1
my own mom is a seriously talented , dynamic woman , but cooking is not one of her favorite things			0
even so , she spent almost every night of my childhood cooking up homemade meatloaf , slow cookers full of oxtail soup , chicken casseroles and other @entity169 specialties just like her own mother had done , just like she thought she had to			0
sadly , and to my mom 's palpable frustration , i do n't remember any of these meals			1
instead , i remember my mom screening documentary films , jumping on the trampoline , going on power walks in the park with her friends			0
these are the things she loved			0
these are the things that shaped who i am			0
while @entity1 has become the new icon of " leaning in , " we need a wide variety of women -- diverse in their ethnic , economic and geographical distribution -- who embody a new era of " leaning out , " too			0
