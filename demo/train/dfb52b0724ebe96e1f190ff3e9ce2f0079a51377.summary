editor 's note : @entity2 is a digital producer and editor for @entity5			1
like many @entity6 , he shoots , edits and produces all of his content himself			1
below are some tips to editing a video piece from start to finish			1
read up , then give @entity2 's advice a try in this week 's @entity15 challenge			1
in the world of video production , it 's not a stretch to say that video editors are easily overlooked			1
last in line to get their hands on the material , the choices a video editor makes can drastically change the impact a video has			1
with the right style , tone and technique , an ordinary video can be transformed into a gripping video experience			1
and once you have the basic tools of how to edit , it 's only a matter of time before you 're editing like a pro. review footage the first step when editing is to get your footage onto your computer			1
the very next step should be to review it			2
watching all of the video you have to work with , from beginning to end , will bring the story back to you			1
and while you 're reviewing your footage , you should also be organizing it			2
organization all editors have their own system of organization			2
some lay their clips out chronologically while others set their clips into scenes			2
first determine how you 'd like to organize your clips and then make it happen			2
luckily , all editing programs from @entity58 to @entity59 have one basic organized layout			1
they include : a timeline ( an area where footage can be laid down for review and cutting ) , a clip bin ( an area where transferred clips can be labeled and organized for viewing ) and a viewer ( the video playback area of your editing program )			1
whether you 're editing a small project or a large one , it 's best to keep the elements in your bin well catalogued			1
@entity77 will save you time and stop an editor from being overwhelmed by the amount of available footage			2
at the beginning of an edit , i break down my video elements into three main groups : b - roll : any video footage that does not include interviews			1
@entity89 : " @entity90 " or @entity91 , refers to interviews or specific audio for your story			2
graphics : extra elements that are created in pre- or post-production to enhance the story			2
make it functional , then fancy no matter how beautiful or beat - up the shots may be , video storytelling is at its core , storytelling			1
as an editor , your main responsibility should be to tell the story in the most responsible way			2
you do this by first arranging your audio from interviews , natural sound and / or a voiceover to create your storyline			2
once that is done , you can then begin to add exciting visual elements to enhance the storytelling			1
lead with action buck the notion that you save the best for last			2
in video , you 've got to grab your viewer 's attention and keep it the entire way through			1
whether it 's compelling video or sound , always lead with an active element that is both integral to the story and interesting to the viewer			1
create pace and tension there 's nothing worse than a story that gives it all away in the beginning			1
as an editor , it 's important to create a storyline with tension that builds to keep the viewer watching			1
if not , you 've broken an unwritten promise to the viewer			2
audio and music music can aid in building pace and tension in a story			2
just remember a piece of music should not change the meaning or intent of the story			0
a way to check this is to simply watch the piece with the music playing -- and then watch it with the music muted			0
if you find your impression of the story as a whole has changed , revisit your music selection			0
a music track should complement your story , not compete with it			0
also select your music carefully			0
do n't use trademarked music unless you have the license to do so			0
try using music that 's available in the public domain			1
sites like @entity177 can help you identity useable music			0
make your edits count as with shooting , there are many cardinal sins in editing			1
among them : jump - cuts , splitting the axis and video effects or transitions			1
jump - cut : a jump - cut occurs when an editor makes a cut that appears to have skipped or jumped forward			0
the easiest example to visualize is in an interview setting			0
if an editor cuts from one thought too quickly to the next without a camera movement or transition , the cut looks noticeably like it has jumped forward			0
a way to avoid this is to use " b - roll " to cover those cuts			0
splitting the axis : splitting the axis differs from a jump - cut because of its severity			0
instead of little change , crossing the axis is a sudden shot change from one side of your subject to his or her opposite side			0
to better understand , imagine you 're watching an interview			0
the person is facing the camera with most of their right side toward the camera			0
suddenly , the camera angle changes , and you see the opposite side of the interviewee			0
you have crossed the axis - which is a visually jarring cut , and something that should be avoided at all costs			0
video effects and / or transitions : when used effectively ( and sparingly ) , these elements can aid in cleaning up a video			1
a white flash can help mitigate a jump cut , or a dip to black can add needed pacing to an emotional story			0
restraint the @entity242 acronym -- " @entity243 " has never let me down			0
suppressing your desire to add in more elements can oftentimes be your best tool			0
this may mean eliminating useless transition effects , graphics or excessive shot changes			0
finishing touches after you 've edited your piece , take the time to critically review the choices you 've made in both story and video			1
a peer - review is a great tool			0
showing your work to someone who has n't seen it before will provide a fresh perspective on your piece			0
listening to the person 's feedback will help you fill in holes that you may not have noticed yourself			1
tips learned the hard way save constantly			0
no one wants to redo their project			0
if you have enough space , either keep the footage on your camera or double up your material on another computer			0
