@entity0 , @entity1 -- another player has entered the immigration battle as the @entity6 sues @entity5 over its new immigration law			2
and the reason the fight is centered in @entity5 is that reform has failed in @entity11			2
like the characters in " @entity14 , " reformers are stuck in 1986			1
that 's when @entity16 passed , and president @entity17 signed into law , the @entity19 , which married border control and the legalization of millions of illegal immigrants			1
reformers today are misguided to seek a similar " grand bargain " on immigration			1
history shows 1986 was an anomaly , and the desire to get everything for a controversial group typically gets nothing			2
but there 's hope : a few in the movement have begun to see that getting meaningful action will require small steps and " mini-bargains			2
" how did we get here ? the @entity19 , the bill resulting from the 1986 grand bargain , proved to be a spectacular failure			2
although it legalized 3 million people , the border and enforcement provisions were toothless			0
by 2009 , the @entity47 said there were 10.8 million illegal immigrants in the @entity50 -- nearly matching the population of @entity52			0
reformers today still try to link legalization of the vast majority of resident illegals with stronger enforcement mechanisms -- just as they did in 1986			1
but the 1986 grand bargain taught today 's immigration restrictionists a simple lesson : do n't make any more grand bargains			1
many in @entity16 will not support mass legalization unless the enforcement mechanisms are proven to work			1
nearly all @entity64 and many @entity65 will vote against legalization because their most vocal constituents oppose benefits to those they see as morally unworthy			0
illegals , they say , violated the law and @entity50 sovereignty , put @entity50 security at risk and then took @entity50 jobs			0
the way forward out of the stalemate should start the way all policy starts that benefits unpopular groups : target the most deserving			0
modern civil rights policy started small in a 1941 @entity82 executive order : no discrimination against african - americans working in defense industries			0
big changes start with small steps			0
similarly , immigration reformers must start with the strongest claims to legalization : students and soldiers			1
hundreds of thousands of kids are undocumented because their parents brought them here			0
the best students in cities such as @entity99 , @entity1 -- high achieving , polite and outgoing , and as accent - free as any suburban kid -- often turn out to be illegal immigrants			0
they did n't choose to break any law , but their legal status leaves them with no opportunities			0
thousands more young people are willing to fight with the @entity50 military , but can not			0
sens. @entity109 , @entity110 , and @entity111 , @entity112 , introduced the " dream " act in 2009 to offer legal status to these young people who were brought here as children and finished college or two years of military service			1
starting reform with @entity114 would target the most deserving of the undocumented			0
supporters of comprehensive reform and legalization worry that the dream act will take away the impetus for further reform and benefit only a fraction of the illegal immigrants in the @entity50			1
yet the current strategy has benefited no one			0
although it is true that the dream act will initially help only a few hundred - thousand , @entity133 reformers should not forget the lesson of minority rights since the 1940s : rights expand over time , covering more groups and more issues			1
after the students and veterans gain legalization , the next step would be their families			1
family unification may be another sympathetic cause and political winner			0
restrictionists point out that these students and soldiers will always be lawbreakers and should remain excluded			1
but they need to be reminded that 2006 's enforcement - only bill not only failed , but also provoked a firestorm of protest that makes the current demonstrations regarding @entity5 's new immigration law look like picnics			1
border control and enforcement , like legalization , needs to move forward incrementally and be paired with a scaled - down sweetener : @entity114			1
here , then , is the mini-bargain			0
supporting the dream act is good politics for @entity64 restrictionists , who need to avoid appearing mean - spirited ( which turns off independents ) and anti-latino for their electoral future			1
legalization forces can get @entity114 , but they must also support increased border enforcement			2
it is time to try something new			0
the pursuit of a 1986 - style grand bargain is blocking the path of potential patriotic soldiers and is failing good kids -- as well as @entity50 's future			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			2

@entity185 : immigration reformers must scale back ; they ca n't get everything at once
1986 act tying legalization and border control failed ; wo n't work today , he writes
@entity183 says start with the strongest claims to legalization : students and soldiers
*author* supports *bipartisan* dream act , which offers " mini-bargains " for legalization
