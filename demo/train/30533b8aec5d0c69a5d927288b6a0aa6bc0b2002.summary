@entity0 -- setting up a showdown with the @entity4 and @entity7 @entity6 , @entity4 @entity3 leaders thursday proceeded with plans to vote next week on a proposal to extend the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits while easing the path for approval of the @entity15 oil pipeline			1
meanwhile , the @entity7 blocked competing @entity6 and @entity3 proposals to extend the payroll tax cut from proceeding thursday , with both failing to get the 60 votes necessary			1
@entity7 @entity3 halted the @entity6 proposal on a 50 - 48 vote			1
it included a surtax on income over $ 1 million to help pay for the lower payroll tax rate			2
republicans seeking to shrink the size of government oppose such a tax increase			0
opposition from both parties blocked the @entity3 measure , with only 22 votes in favor and 76 against it			2
the measure would have been paid for by freezing federal pay as well as reducing the federal work force by 10 % , provisions rejected by president @entity38 and @entity6			2
the outcome means party leaders and @entity38 must work out a compromise by the end of the year , when the payroll tax cut is set to expire , or face the wrath of @entity45 facing higher taxes in the election year of 2012			1
on the @entity4 side , speaker @entity48 , @entity49 , told a closed - door meeting of @entity3 members that he was ready for a " fight " with @entity38 over the pipeline issue , according to two senior @entity3 leadership aides in the meeting			1
cheers went up in the room after @entity48 's comment , the aides said			0
on wednesday , @entity38 said he would reject any attempt by @entity3 to tie the pipeline project to the payroll tax extension issue			1
the @entity4 proposal would shift authority from the @entity66 to the @entity67 for approving the proposed pipeline from @entity70 's oil sands production in northern @entity71 to @entity72			1
it also would shorten the time frame for a decision			0
the @entity66 recently said its decision would be delayed until 2013 to examine environmental issues raised by critics , a move republicans labeled as political to put off the issue until after next year 's presidential election			0
@entity48 told reporters after thursday 's meeting that the pipeline project would generate " tens of thousands of jobs immediately			2
" he also noted that @entity70 prime minister @entity86 supports the plan			0
the @entity66 puts the jobs figure at 5,000 - 6,000 , and senate majority leader @entity88 , @entity89 , slammed the @entity4 @entity3 proposal on thursday as a " partisan joke that has no chance of passing the @entity7			1
" the impasse sets up another countdown clock on congressional action , this time before the end - of - year holiday recess scheduled to begin at the end of next week			0
@entity38 told reporters thursday that he was willing to stay in @entity0 " as long as it takes to make sure that the @entity45 people 's taxes do n't go up on january 1st and to make sure that folks who desperately need unemployment insurance get that help			2
" " there is absolutely no excuse for us not getting it done , " @entity38 said , adding that his response to efforts by @entity3 " to see what can they extract from us in order to get this done " was " just do the right thing			2
" referring specifically to the @entity15 project , @entity38 said that " however many jobs might be generated by a @entity15 pipeline , there are going to be a lot fewer than the jobs that are created by extending the payroll tax cut and extending unemployment insurance			1
" the @entity4 proposal , which @entity48 and other leaders outlined to @entity3 members at thursday 's meeting , was largely similar to one they discussed last week , according to several aides			1
it would extend the payroll tax cut for one year , continuing savings of $ 1,000 for families earning $ 50,000			1
it also includes unemployment assistance but gives states the ability to reform the program -- including removal of a federal ban from the 1960s that prohibited states from drug - testing those who apply for unemployment benefits			0
the @entity3 legislation would also shorten the time period for receiving jobless aid benefits from the current level of 99 weeks , phasing it down to 59 weeks by the middle of 2012			0
in addition , the bill would avoid a scheduled cut in payments for @entity156 physicians for two years -- the so - called " doc fix			0
" @entity48 noted that the bill is " fully paid for , " and aides said the bulk of the cost would be offset from a freeze on salaries of federal employees and members of @entity166 through 2015			0
the measure would use funds from health care programs to pay for the @entity156 " doc fix " provision			0
last week , @entity3 leaders encountered significant resistance from conservatives when they outlined their plan , with a bloc of members opposing any renewal of the payroll tax cut because the bill uses spending cuts over 10 years to pay for a one - year extension			1
some of those critics later said that after they talked through their concerns with leaders , they do n't want to see a tax increase during the tough economy , even though they do n't support the structure of the payroll tax cut			1
@entity3 leaders also added a couple of new spending cuts to help attract conservative support			0
one would eliminate the child tax credit for those in the country illegally , and another would not renew a research - and - development tax credit focused on energy programs			0
some @entity3 noted that @entity38 's comments the day before opposing any effort to link extending the payroll tax cut to the @entity15 pipeline helped rally support for the plan			1
@entity207 rep. @entity206 , leader of the fiscally conservative @entity208 , said he supports the bill , adding : " frankly , the fact that the president does n't like it makes me like it even more			0
" asked about overcoming divisions among @entity3 , @entity48 said feedback on the proposal was good and that " i feel confident about our ability to move ahead			2
" the @entity4 is expected to vote on the bill early next week , according to several aides			0
even though the @entity3 plan could muster a majority of votes in the @entity4 , it is likely to encounter major obstacles in the @entity6 - led @entity7			1
the payroll tax issue , a headache for @entity3 already , threatens to become a major campaign theme for 2012			1
@entity38 touched on it tuesday in a policy address in @entity230 , saying republicans protected wealthy taxpayers from a tax increase during deficit negotiations this year , but now threaten to block the payroll tax cut extension			1
blocking it would cause most @entity45 to pay higher taxes next year			0
republicans , who oppose tax increases in keeping with their push to shrink the size of government , argue that @entity38 and @entity6 are forcing votes on proposals they know wo n't pass in order to score political points			1
so far , the public backs the @entity6 position , with polls showing majority support for increasing the tax burden on wealthy @entity45 to help pay for the measure			0
@entity3 are on the defensive due to their history of arguing that tax cuts end up paying for themselves because they stimulate economic activity by letting consumers keep more of their money instead of giving it to the government			0
@entity6 are quick to point out that the mounting federal deficits dominating the @entity0 discussion were caused in part by reduced revenue due to tax cuts from the @entity268 administration			0
now both parties agree that any measure to extend the payroll tax cut should include provisions to reduce spending or raise revenue to offset the cost			1
as part of a budget - cutting deal last december , @entity38 and @entity166 negotiated a reduction of 2 percentage points in the payroll tax rate -- from 6.2 % to 4.2 %			1
with the reduced rate expiring on january 1 , @entity38 and @entity6 seek to expand the provision by lowering the rate even further -- to 3.1 % -- for another year			2
republicans initially opposed the idea , saying the provision failed to create jobs last year			0
@entity3 leaders now say they support an extension , but they differ with @entity38 and @entity6 on how to pay for it			1
the latest @entity7 @entity6 plan calls for a 1.9 % surtax on income over $ 1 million , as well as increased fees that @entity293 and @entity295 charge mortgage lenders to guarantee repayment of new mortgage loans to cover the $ 180 billion cost			2
@entity3 oppose the plan because they say it will increase the tax burden on small - business owners , a contention the @entity4 says is false			2
in their compromise , @entity304 and @entity305 included a provision to exempt the income of small - business owners from the surtax			0
however , @entity4 @entity3 questioned whether it was possible to legislate such a distinction			2
@entity1 's @entity313 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity316 rejects planned @entity4 proposal
separate @entity6 and @entity3 proposals are blocked in the @entity7
raising taxes remains an *unresolved* issue dividing @entity6 and @entity3
@entity4 @entity3 proposal links payroll tax cut to an oil pipeline project , defying @entity38
