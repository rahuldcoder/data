-- @entity2 secret interrogation methods -- including detention and harsh questioning of suspected terrorists -- remain off limits to public release , a federal appeals court ruled monday			1
the agency was sued eight years ago to provide details of certain communications describing the use of waterboarding and other direct intelligence - gathering methods of foreign terror suspects			1
a three - judge panel from the 2nd @entity18 @entity17 ruled " intelligence methods " are not subject to a @entity20 request from the lawsuit by the @entity22			1
" we give substantial weight to the government 's declarations , which establish that disclosing the redacted portions of the ( secret memos ) would reveal the existence and scope of a highly classified , active intelligence activity , " said the judges			1
the @entity2 has admitted as part of the lawsuit it destroyed videotaped interrogations of " high - value " terror suspects @entity38 and @entity39			0
the alleged members of the @entity42 terror network are being held overseas , including most recently at the @entity44 military prison in @entity45			0
the @entity22 wanted transcripts of those tapes and a @entity38 photograph , written summaries , or other information relating to the so - called " waterboarding " of suspected terrorists in @entity18 custody			1
some civil liberties groups have equated the methods to torture , and have argued that government and military officials should be held publicly accountable			0
" public disclosure of certain government records may not always be in the public interest , " judge @entity59 wrote for a unanimous three - judge panel			0
he said it was both " logical and plausible " for the @entity2 to control how it conducts intelligence operations , and how it works with foreign intelligence liaison partners			0
the judges also dismissed a lower federal court order to release two classified memos from @entity72 attorneys , which discuss the legality of " enhanced interrogation techniques			2
" the issue was whether the material was classified since the memos reportedly dealt not with specific methods , only their legality			0
the court said it was not its job to conduct a " complex inquiry " into government discussions of its intelligence - gathering			1
president @entity87 has since disavowed the future use of waterboarding , where simulated drowning of immobile prisoners was conducted			0
the @entity22 , along with the @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 -- among other groups suing -- now have the option of asking the @entity18 @entity97 to intervene			2
the justices earlier monday agreed to hear a case from the @entity22 over whether a coalition of @entity18 can go to court and challenge a federal law allowing broad electronic surveillance of suspected foreign terrorists and spies			2
the @entity2 interrogation cases are @entity22 v. @entity107 ( 10 - 4289 , 10 - 4290 , 10 - 4647 , 10 - 4668 ) .			2

the @entity22 wanted details of @entity2 intelligence - gathering methods
a federal appeals court says such details remain off limits to public release
details would reveal " highly classified , active intelligence activity , " the judges said
the *plaintiffs* could ask the @entity97 to intervene
