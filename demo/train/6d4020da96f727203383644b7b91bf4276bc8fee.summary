@entity0 , @entity1 -- during a meeting with historians in 2011 , @entity3 reported , president @entity6 said : " what you could do for me is to help me find a way to discuss the issue of inequality in our society without being accused of class warfare			1
" for @entity6 , this is not an esoteric question			1
rather , this is a challenge that will be integral to his campaign and , if he is re-elected , to his second term as president			2
many democrats have argued that @entity6 should have tackled this issue from his first day in the @entity25			1
but this is an issue the president did n't think he had the political capital to address			1
he has also continually feared that touching on inequality would open him up to @entity30 attacks of being left of center			1
@entity6 's question to the historians has no easy answer			1
when @entity23 presidents have tackled issues of inequality , they have usually come under intense attack			1
that is the cost of trying to address this problem through government			0
( @entity30 argue this is best left to the marketplace			0
) the key to success has been how strong the @entity23 ' responses to the critics have been			1
two @entity23 presidents who tackled the problem of inequality in the 20th century in very different times were @entity52 and @entity53			1
in 1932 , @entity52 took office at the height of the @entity56 , with 25 % of the workforce unemployed			1
he argued that the federal government would have to help take care of those who were suffering			0
@entity52 promoted policies that aimed to provide greater economic security to working and middle - class @entity63			1
many of his key policies -- such as public works , @entity67 , and the right to join a union -- aimed to make certain that the bottom did not fall out for those who were not rich and that average @entity63 had a strong foundation to climb up the income ladder once the @entity56 ended			2
the business community responded predictably			0
while some leaders in the corporate world accepted the need for a @entity79 , many others did not			0
the @entity80 , an organization founded by business leaders in 1934 , attacked @entity52 for trying to stoke class conflict and dividing @entity63 for his own political objectives			1
following his combative @entity85 message in january 1936 , when @entity52 declared that his administration had " earned the hatred of entrenched greed , " the @entity80 denounced his effort to pit " class against class			1
" @entity52 did n't run away			1
he insisted that the government had a duty to strengthen those who were disadvantaged			0
he also embraced the argument that if middle - class @entity63 prospered , they would spend money in consumer markets , which would in turn help the whole economy			2
finally , at some moments he argued that the nation suffered when the wealthy accumulated excessive economic and political power			2
in a 1936 campaign speech , @entity52 said : " we had to struggle with the old enemies of peace -- business and financial monopoly , speculation , reckless banking , class antagonism , sectionalism , war profiteering			1
... never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today			2
they are unanimous in their hate for me -- and i welcome their hatred			2
" @entity53 was more timid in certain respects			1
@entity53 rarely spoke about the obligations of the rich , nor did he push for any kinds of tax increases until later in his presidency			1
but he was willing to deal with the suffering of those who were not sharing in the prosperity of the era			0
he argued that a nation as great as the @entity63 could not simply let inequality persist			0
the centerpiece of his earlier years was the @entity136			0
in his @entity85 in january 1964 , @entity53 said : " unfortunately , many @entity63 live on the outskirts of hope -- some because of their poverty , and some because of their color , and all too many because of both			1
our task is to help replace their despair with opportunity			0
this administration today , here and now , declares unconditional war on poverty in @entity63			0
... the richest nation on earth can afford to win it			0
we can not afford to lose it			0
" republicans did not sit by quietly			0
they attacked him for distributing funds to groups they called radical organizations and spending government money on urban populations			0
in 1964 , @entity162 candidate @entity162 said the @entity136 was an attempt to " divide @entity63			0
" @entity53 responded that his anti-poverty programs would in fact help the poor become self - sufficient and give them the tools to be good citizens			2
it has become more difficult for @entity23 presidents to discuss inequality for three reasons			1
the first is the rise of the conservative movement , the mobilization of right - wing politicians , activists , and organizations who shifted political debate to the right			0
certain questions , such as the role of government in diminishing inequality , became politically explosive			0
the second reason is the particular state of the economy			0
during the 1930s , the state of the economic downturn was so severe that business and the wealthy had their backs to the wall , and progressive discussions about inequality received greater support			2
during the 1960s , the era of economic growth created the impression that the economic pie could continue to expand so that everyone could enjoy the rewards of the expanding @entity201			0
currently , the economy is stagnant , yet conditions are not as severe as in the 1930s			0
as a result , discussions of inequality are still politically risky at the same time that they appear to require a zero - sum game where , to ease inequality , one side would have to lose in order for the other to gain			0
finally , the campaign system is flooded with private money , with both presidential candidates taking enormous contributions from wealthy interests who have little appetite for policies that would seriously diminish economic inequality , such as strengthening the progressive tax system			2
as a result , there is strong counter-pressure against any politician , @entity226 or @entity30 , who is thinking of taking this step			0
regardless of these changes , a vibrant national discussion about inequality , with the president taking the lead , is essential			2
the 2012 campaign offers @entity6 an opportunity to put this problem on the national agenda			2
the challenge for @entity6 is that there really is no way around the inevitable attacks , and there is no way to talk about economic inequality other than talking about it			1
rather than looking for rhetorical tricks , @entity6 should instead focus on having the best arguments in response to the conservative attacks			1
this will require borrowing from @entity52 a defense of how a vibrant middle class will be crucial to revitalizing @entity63 's economic position in the world , and from @entity53 an argument that the ethical obligation to help the poorest is incumbent on our democracy			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity262 .			2

president @entity6 reportedly asked historians for defense *vs.* ' class warfare ' attacks
@entity262 : there 's no way for president to avoid conflict over the issue of inequality
two @entity23 presidents -- @entity52 and @entity53 -- found different ways to raise the issue , he says
@entity262 : today 's economic stagnation increases the difficulty of addressing inequality
