-- as an event attracting worldwide attention and mass media coverage , it is perhaps not surprising that the @entity8 have , over the course of their history , served as a platform for all manner of political statements and protests			0
from the @entity15 ' manipulation of the @entity16 to promote the myth of white @entity19 supremacy , through to @entity21 's iconic parading of the aboriginal flag at @entity23 , politics and the @entity8 have never been too far apart , despite the best efforts of the @entity25 to keep the competition rigorously neutral			0
of all the many occasions on which the @entity28 have been used as a stage for political dissent , however , few , if any , were as powerful , or as eloquent , as the moment at the 1968 @entity32 when @entity35 athletes @entity33 and @entity36 stood on the winner 's podium and gave a @entity40 salute in protest at continued racial oppression in their native @entity35			1
the action had its roots in the formation the previous year of the @entity47 ( @entity47 )			0
inspired by the growing @entity35 @entity49 , the @entity47 's aim was to encourage black @entity35 athletes to boycott the @entity28 as a means of highlighting @entity35 civil rights abuses			1
as its founding statement declared : " we must no longer allow this country to use a few so - called @entity55 to point out to the world how much progress she has made in solving her racial problems when the oppression of @entity61 is greater than it ever was			0
" although the boycott itself failed to materialize , the @entity47 's ideals were not forgotten by many of the black athletes who went to @entity68 , among them @entity33 and @entity36 , both @entity47 members			1
when both men won medals in the 200 meters -- @entity33 the gold , @entity36 the bronze -- they determined to hold a non-violent protest to draw attention to the plight of their fellow black @entity61 ( the timing was especially poignant since @entity80 , the leader of the @entity81 , had been assassinated only six months previously )			1
olive branch the two sprinters took to the winner 's podium shoeless , wearing black socks ( to represent the poverty of @entity61 ) , black scarves ( to symbolize the horror of lynchings ) and black gloves ( as a mark of black unity and strength )			0
@entity33 also carried a box containing an olive branch as an emblem of peace			1
as the @entity35 flag was raised and the national anthem played they held up their fists -- @entity33 his right , @entity36 his left -- in a @entity40 salute			1
beside them silver medallist @entity107 , a white @entity109 , sported an @entity47 patch in order to show solidarity with their actions			0
" i just could n't salute the flag in the accepted manner , " @entity33 later said , " because it did n't represent me fully , only asking me to be great on the track and then obliging me to come home and be just another nigger			2
" although the protest was both dignified and peaceful , it provoked instant outrage among the @entity35 athletics authorities			2
@entity33 and @entity36 were suspended from their national team , stripped of their medals and expelled from the athletes ' village			1
the response back in @entity35 was even more hysterical			2
the @entity131 condemned the athletes for what it described as a ' @entity135 - like salute , ' while @entity136 ran a picture of the @entity47 logo with the traditional @entity47 motto " @entity142 " replaced by the words " @entity141 , uglier			0
" both men 's families received death threats			0
if there was anger , however , there was also widespread admiration for the men 's courage in daring to defy @entity47 protocol			0
@entity153 described it as " the single most courageous act of this century , " while @entity156 , anchor of the @entity35 women 's gold - medal winning 4x100 meter relay team , dedicated the team 's victory to the two ostracized sprinters			1
despite that , both men 's athletics careers were badly damaged by their protest			0
although his 200 - meters winning time set a new world record that was to stand for 11 years @entity33 never ran for the @entity35 again , and was eventually forced to give up athletics and turn to @entity170 instead			1
@entity36 was also cold - shouldered by the @entity35 sporting establishment , and for years struggled to land a proper job neither , however , have any regrets about their iconic protest			1
" i had no regrets , i have no regrets , i will never have any regrets , " @entity33 said			2
" we were there to stand up for human rights and to stand up for black @entity61			2
we wanted to make them better in the @entity35			0

@entity35 sprinters @entity36 and @entity33 stand up for civil rights in 1968 in @entity68
they were suspended from their national team and stripped of their medals
@entity153 described it : " the single most courageous act of this century "
