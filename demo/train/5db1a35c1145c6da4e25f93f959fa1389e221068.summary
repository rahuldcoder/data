presidential hopeful sen. @entity2 greets people before speaking in @entity0 on september 17			0
" i 've reached the conclusion that the best way to support our troops is begin bringing them home , " the @entity12 senator and former first lady told @entity1 's " @entity18			1
" " i do n't believe we should continue to vote for funding that has an open - ended commitment , that has no pressure on the @entity6 government to make the tough political decisions they have to make , or which really gives any urgency to the @entity29 administration 's diplomatic efforts			1
" @entity31 's declaration comes as the @entity32 debates the @entity34 's 2008 spending authorization bill			2
it follows her vote against a $ 120 billion war - spending bill in may , when @entity39 dropped a call for the withdrawal of @entity9 combat troops by march 2008 after president @entity29 vetoed a bill containing that provision			2
" the president has no intention of changing his policy in @entity6 , " she said			1
" he 's now talking about leaving it to his successor			0
" meanwhile , the @entity32 's @entity50 minority routinely filibusters @entity3 proposals to wind down the war , which is costing the @entity53 about $ 10 billion a month and has claimed the lives of nearly 3,800 @entity9 troops			0
may 's spending bill made continued @entity9 support contingent on a set of benchmarks for @entity6 's government			1
but the @entity6 met only 11 of the 18 benchmarks , according to the @entity62 , the investigative arm of @entity39			0
" even those who are implementing this policy of the president 's can not tell us it will make @entity9 more safe , nor that it will lead to the kind of political decision - making that we have to expect from the @entity6 themselves , " @entity31 said			1
nearly two - thirds of the @entity9 public now opposes the war , according to a @entity1 - @entity74 poll conducted in early september			2
@entity31 said , if elected president , she would end the conflict " as quickly and responsibly as i can , " but said some @entity9 forces would likely remain as trainers , to protect @entity9 and to battle @entity81 militants loyal to @entity82			1
the two - term senator , who leads her @entity3 presidential rivals by a double - digit margin in national polls , made the rounds of all five @entity0 talk shows sunday			0
last week , @entity31 supported two amendments that would have forced the @entity34 to begin a @entity9 withdrawal from @entity6			1
but she said sunday that even if @entity3 muster enough @entity50 support to break a filibuster -- something they have been unable to do -- democrats would still be unlikely to get the two - thirds vote needed to override a presidential veto			2
" the answer for this is , let 's elect more democrats in 2008 , " she said			0
" that will help solve the problem			0
