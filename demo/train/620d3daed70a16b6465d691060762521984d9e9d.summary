-- chalk it up to the benefit of lowered expectations : @entity4 guest - hosted " @entity7 " last night , and it was one of her best television appearance in the past few years			1
of course , that 's not saying much			0
but compared to her @entity10 interview / @entity12 hosting gig in march 2012 , where it seemed like nerves got the best of her , the actress looked healthy , landed a few good punchlines and , most encouragingly for @entity4 fans , appeared genuinely happy to be in front of a camera that was n't tracking her movements in and out of a courthouse			2
@entity0 : ' @entity27 ' - we saw it so you do n't have to there was a little nervous laughter and stuttering during her opening monologue , which featured @entity4 thanking the various people who 've kept the tabloids in business while @entity4 had been away on a " court - ordered vacation in @entity38 " the past 90 days , a.k.a. @entity39 , @entity41 , @entity42 and the royal baby ( played by @entity7 sidekick @entity44 , obviously )			1
" how come when @entity41 acts like an idiot he gets a gold record , but when i act like an idiot i get a police record ? " a game @entity4 asked the audience			1
when the show returned from commercial break , @entity4 joined comics @entity53 , @entity55 , and @entity56 at the table to riff on the news of the day			2
and while obviously her lines were mostly scripted , she still delivered them with aplomb , and seemed to really be having a good time -- particularly with her crack about @entity63 - er @entity62 possibly having a bisexual relationship with a dj. " been there ! " she quipped			0
one of the high point of @entity4 's appearance was -- as is typical for her -- self - deprecating jokes			1
in addition to laughing at the comics ' remarks about her own public issues ( " @entity42 has been on tour longer than you 've been in rehab " ) , @entity4 landed her own jokes about her problems with alcohol			2
while commenting about gay - rights activists who dumped vodka to protest @entity83 's new policies , @entity4 remarked , " waste of good vodka , " before explaining she was allergic			1
" [ i ca n't drink vodka			0
] i wind up in rehab or jail , " she said with a laugh , before seriously adding , " rightfully so			0
" @entity0 : can ' @entity27 ' salvage the career of @entity4 ? but while @entity4 going the self - deprecating route has become expected , the appearance is noteworthy for her candid goofiness			1
during a segment about a viral video that had a girl singing into a curling iron before grabbing it like a hairbrush and burning her hand , @entity4 sympathized			2
" it 's so true ! " she explained as she acted it out			0
but fans should n't expect to see anything similar on @entity4 's @entity105			1
" i would never selfie video myself curling my hair ! that 's a ' delete ' moment ! " she explained with a laugh			0
it was n't a hysterical or game - changing joke			0
but for @entity4 sympathizers who are constantly on the lookout for the likable , promising young actress of 2004 , her ability to joke around and still be kind of charmingly relatable was the strongest evidence in quite a while that maybe , below the substance abuse issues and the 24/7 drama , that lady still exists			2
the enthusiastic audience at @entity7 was clearly hoping so			1
