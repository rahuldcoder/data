a @entity1 day care has shut down because an infant there -- who 's too young to get vaccinated -- contracted measles , another case in the re-emergence of the disease on the @entity9			1
the @entity10 inside @entity11 , a facility for 24 young children of students and staff members , closed monday after it was learned that a baby under 12 months old being care for there had measles			1
it 's not clear when , where or how the child got the disease			2
nor is there any timetable for when the center will reopen , but it 's possible that children who have been immunized against the highly contagious virus could soon go back			0
in addition to the baby with measles , 13 other infants who went to the day care center are being quarantined for 21 days as a safeguard			1
" it 's the best thing to do to protect the babies and the community , " @entity35 spokeswoman @entity34 said of the closure			0
" it 's a tough situation			0
" for all the talk about vaccination and measles , in one respect it 's irrelevant in this case : children should n't get the first dose until 12 through 15 months of age , with the second dose coming when they are between 4 and 6 years old , according to the @entity51			1
then again , the fact that infants are n't vaccinated makes them even more vulnerable -- especially at a time when more and more measles cases are popping up daily in @entity1			1
so far , this latest case has n't affected the rest of @entity11 or its 3,100 - plus students , beyond the three teenage mothers with children who go to the day care center			1
an assistant baseball coach ( who did n't teach at the school ) contracted the disease weeks ago , but he 's since returned with a clean bill of health			0
according to the school district , 11.5 % of all @entity68 and @entity69 students have not been immunized because their parents opted out			2
this is legal in @entity1 , but controversial -- with some , including medical professionals , saying that vaccinations are a safe , effective and necessary means to prevent the spread of diseases like measles			1
@entity79 starts with a fever , runny nose , cough , red eyes and sore throat			0
for most people , it does n't get much worse than that -- and yet one out of every 20 children with measles also contract pneumonia , and one or two out of every 1,000 children with the disease die from it , according to the @entity51			1
while once widespread in the @entity95 , cases dropped significantly thanks to vaccines			0
in 2000 , health authorities declared that measles had been eliminated in the @entity95 , which meant it was no longer native to the @entity95 but continued to be brought in by international travelers			2
but that does n't mean no one has gotten it since			0
last year , the @entity95 had its most number of measles cases -- at 644 -- since 2000 , the @entity51 reported on its website			1
and in the first month of this year alone , 102 people reportedly had come down with the disease			0
measles outbreak : how bad is it ? those cases were reported in 14 states , but the vast majority were in @entity1			1
the @entity112 alone had 92 new cases since december , most of those tied to an outbreak at @entity115 , according to the state 's public health department			0
most of the 59 people originally affected were park employees and patrons			0
those numbers are one of the reasons @entity1 has been at the epicenter of this story , but not the only one			2
another has to do with vaccinations			2
@entity1 allows exemptions from vaccinations for medical reasons and " personal beliefs , " and parents have been using them			2
over the last school year , 3.3 % of @entity1 kindergartners -- about 18,200 -- were allowed to skip their shots , according to the @entity51			1
schools are encouraged to have " an up - to - date list of pupils with exemptions , so they can be excluded quickly if an outbreak occurs , " the @entity139 says			0
opinion : why i wo n't let unvaccinated people around my kids @entity2 's @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 contributed to this report .			0
