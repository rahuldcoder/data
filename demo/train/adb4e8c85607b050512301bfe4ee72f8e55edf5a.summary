-- when i was a teenager and in my early twenties , i always discussed with my most trusted friends what it might be like to live in a free world			1
we were locked behind the @entity8 and none of us believed we would live to see the fall of the communist dictatorship			1
my father used to say : " every dictatorship will fall one day because it is inhuman , it is not natural			1
but communism is here for a long haul			1
we are not going to see it in our life times			1
" thank @entity19 , we were all wrong			1
life in @entity21 was not free			1
my first political experience dates to august 1968			1
i was five when @entity21 was invaded by @entity24 troops			1
i remember soldiers in the streets , my mother crying , my father hitting a wall with his fist in frustration and my grandfather helplessly pacing in a living room			1
it did not get much better after that			1
my father had to fight for his job as a university professor after he was reported to the communist authorities for calling his students " ladies and gentlemen " instead of " comrades			1
" i remember my mother getting up early to stand in a line for beef bones to make soup			1
i also remember how she would worry when my dad was late from work , wondering if he had he been arrested for being overheard telling a political joke or making a sarcastic comment about people waiting in line for toilet paper			1
i saw some of my brightest fellow students kicked out of university for publicly expressing political opinions -- young lives ruined			1
i also remember my frustration as a young mountain climber that i was not allowed to travel to the @entity59 or anywhere else west of the @entity8			1
my parents managed to create a microcosm of relative normalcy in our home			1
they traveled on occasional business trips to the @entity67 and smuggled banned books by @entity69 , @entity70 or @entity71 back to @entity21 , an act that could have landed them in prison			1
i listened to @entity75 on the radio with my father every morning and evening -- quietly , so the neighbors could n't hear us and report us			1
on my 15th birthday i got my first wristwatch and a translation of the inauguration speech of @entity83			1
in 1987 i landed a job as a producer of music programs on @entity87 in the city of @entity89 , earning about $ 60 a month			1
i was excited at first			1
i was working with @entity21 rock bands and pop stars			1
but from the beginning , my enthusiasm was eroded by numerous censors overseeing my work			1
they were mostly people who had no idea about tv or music , but had studied @entity100 and were employed to watch for " ideologically harmful " content			1
and in rock ' n ' roll they saw plenty of it			1
once , after months of negotiations , i managed to get a contract with a @entity108 company that allowed me free access to clips of music videos by international artsits			2
it was the first contract of its kind in the history of @entity21 television but when i went triumphantly took it to my boss , i was yelled at and called " a propagator of imperialism			2
" my argument that songs by @entity123 , @entity124 or @entity125 were not political fell on deaf ears			2
two - thirds of the songs never made it to air			2
through my job i was meeting and befriending a lot of amazing people			2
talented artists , but also semi-legal bands , dissident bands or dissidents themselves			2
i felt that the mood in the society was changing			2
there had been occasional small anti-government demonstrations since 1988			2
more and more people were speaking out against the regime			2
a lot of banned bands performed illegally in private garages , summer cottages and even publically under false names			2
still , i could not imagine the communists losing power			2
in june 1989 , after a concert of @entity152 , a group banned by authorities , i was approached by its singer to sign a petition linked to a pro-reform manifesto co-authored by @entity69 that called for the release of all political prisoners , for @entity159 , freedom of religion , for democratization of the society			1
i was aware that whoever signed the petition was professionally doomed			1
singers had their albums pulled from the stores , writers had books pulled from bookstores and libraries , others lost jobs			2
still it took me only a few minutes to sign it			2
i made a decision that i could no longer be friends with opponents of the regime and work for it at the same time			2
it was a professional suicide but i felt it was my only choice			2
i did not tell anyone that i had become a signatory			2
a couple of months later my mother called me at my office in hysterics			2
" they read your name on @entity75 ! did you really sign it ? why did you ruin your life ? " a couple of months later i lost my job and in october 1989 i began my one - year mandatory military service			1
besides military training we had to undergo intensive political education and watch the news on government - run tv			1
this is how i learned about the astonishing events in @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205			2
was it really collapsing ? would it ever come to @entity21 as well ? then came the brutal crushing of a peaceful student demonstration in @entity210 on november 17			2
when our military commanders took away tv sets from our political classrooms , i knew that this was serious			1
after 48 hours in an information vacuum i finally managed to get in touch with my friends in @entity210 who told me that theaters and schools were on strike in protest over the clampdown			2
the next morning , during a military base assembly , i ignored a yelling commander , to stand before hundreds of soldiers and declare a 24 - hour hunger strike in support of actors and students			1
the same day the base doctor , a friend , signed me into his ward with " pneumonia			2
" i was ok , but being declared sick exempted me from military training and enabled me to use the doctor 's office to make phone calls			1
the biggest worry in @entity210 at that time was that the communists would use the army to suppress growing unrest in the country			0
these fears prompted me to write a petition declaring that we -- the conscripted soldiers who made up the most of the @entity21 military -- would never turn our weapons against citizens of @entity21			1
i soon started to collect signatures			0
in the evening i was faxing signed sheets to opposition leaders in @entity210			0
we were very well organized			0
visiting soldiers got copies of the petition and took it to their bases and units			1
after we had collected all the signatures we could at the base i was stationed at , my doctor friend sent me for a fake lung examination to one of the biggest military hospitals in @entity21 in @entity268			1
there , hundreds more soldiers signed			0
it was obvious that no one had an appetite to fight for the communists			0
in less then a week we collected thousands of signatures			0
news from @entity210 was also encouraging			0
the whole country was on strike and up to one million people were demonstrating next to the city 's castle , demanding the resignation of the communist government and the politburo of the @entity285			0
the night after my return to the base from @entity268 i was summoned by the commander 's office			0
it was 2 a.m. and the room was full of top brass			1
" did you write it ? " one colonel asked me pointing at the petition			1
" well , it has my name on it , does n't it ? " i replied			0
" we want you to publicly recant it , " he continued			0
i refused and tried to tell them that the regime 's time was up and that they had better realize it now			0
" if we would shoot you here , nobody would ever know , " another colonel threatened			1
" before i came here i called my friends to say that i was coming to meet with you			0
they will start looking for me if i disappear			0
" i was bluffing filled with fear			0
" get out of here ! " they shouted , finally concluding the meeting			0
on november 24 the communist government resigned			0
soon afterwards @entity69 became the new president of @entity21			0
a couple of weeks later one of my commanders woke me up in the morning			0
" pack your stuff and go home , " he said			0
" what ? " i replied			0
" are you kicking me out ? " " whatever , " he said			0
" just pack your stuff			0
" in @entity210 , i was asked to join the new government to join a committee looking at reforming of the @entity21 military			1
i turned down the offer			0
i wanted to resume my work in television			0
at my station , i was greeted by the same people who kicked me out : " my hero			0
i owe you an apology			0
the @entity285 was deceiving me all these years			0
but now , i know better			0
" i felt sick to my stomach			0
but then , communism in any country did not enhance people 's characters			0
everybody tried to survive as best as they could , sometimes compromising their own values and dignity			0
i do not know how that person feels today			0
perhaps there is even shame and regret			0
when i look back i do not regret being born in a communist country			0
yes , we were deprived of freedom and many other things			0
but it was an intense life experience which taught me to appreciate what i have later in my life			0
i also feel privileged that i lived through and participated in some of the most important and exciting historical events of the 20th century			0
the only regret i have is that my father indeed did not live to experience it			0
he died of cancer in 1982 .			0
