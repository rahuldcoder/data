-- charity : water will receive a $ 5 million grant from @entity5 's @entity4 to provide clean and sustainable water supplies to the world 's most far - flung and impoverished regions			1
the non-profit group that builds water wells for communities in the developing world is hoping to install 4,000 low - cost remote sensors			1
the sensors will transmit real - time data to the charity and its donors on the condition and flow of water at particular wells			1
charity : water founder @entity22 announced the new plan today at the 2012 @entity26 conference in @entity27			1

" we are first going to target @entity35 , @entity36 and a few other @entity38 and @entity39 countries that are undecided at this time			0
" the entire initiative will be funded through @entity5 's @entity4 , a scheme designed by the @entity43 tech giant to support pioneering technologies			0

" for example , our commitment in @entity35 has consisted mainly of hand - dug wells , and in @entity36 , we fund large - scale spring systems			2
two completely different sensors , partners , and methodologies , " he explained			0
knowing the location of the well is n't enough anymore -- the charity also wants to collect information to establish if the wells are working and if they need to be fixed			0
a large part of the pilot program would also involve continuing its work in training local mechanics to maintain the water supply , which charity : water says will spur job creation			1
@entity22 added : " we want to do the best job of fully implementing the technology as well as building up response teams ( mechanics ) to ensure the sustainability of the projects and continue serving our beneficiaries with full transparency			2
" the aid group -- founded in 2006 -- began its work in @entity81 , installing wells in refugee camps			0
since then it has funded over 6,700 projects in 20 countries .			0
