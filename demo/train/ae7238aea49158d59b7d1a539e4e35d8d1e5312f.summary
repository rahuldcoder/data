they might be over 65 , but these former burlesque dancers have n't lost the charisma that made them so desirable in their heyday			1
whether it 's a seductive , sensual pose or something more fun and playful , it 's clear they are n't afraid to be bold in front of the camera			2
" i really enjoyed being around those women , " said photographer @entity10 , who documented them in her book " legends : the living art of @entity16			1
" " i found that they had a real knowledge of life but also of this work			0
they were very self - sufficient			0
" all of the women featured in @entity10 's book used to dance in burlesque theaters , enticing the audience with a strip show			1
but burlesque is about more than just skin			2
" burlesque is interesting because it 's a space where women of all kinds , physically speaking , can actually go onstage , " @entity10 said			1
" they have to have personality and rhythm , they have to know how to dance , and they have to also be an artist because they have to do all those costumes and create a choreography			0
" @entity42 was also empowering for many of the women , especially @entity45 who performed before the sexual revolution of the 1960s			2
" striptease for them was a passport to discover their own country and to travel abroad			0
... they would have agents , they would get contracts , " @entity10 said			1
over time , however , burlesque theaters lost their popularity in the @entity45 as strip clubs became more prominent			2

" the ' 80s were really the era where all the glamour kind of disappeared and what the audience wanted was more flesh always , " @entity10 said			1
" all of those women always described in the interview how it was difficult to transition between the ' 70s and the ' 80s , where the glamour was no longer there and the bosses of the clubs were asking them to get rid of the costumes and actually show more			2
" " and those women arrived at an age where they were 40 , 45 sometimes 50 years old			2
they were still very beautiful , but it was also an age issue where they saw that maybe they should stop and start to do something else			0
also , the money was not the same			0
they used to make a lot of money , and suddenly it was n't that good			0
" @entity10 became interested in burlesque during a trip to @entity94 in 2011 , where she met legendary dancer @entity96			1
she later photographed an annual burlesque festival in the city			2
through the contacts she made there , she reached out to former burlesque dancers across the country and asked if she could come to their homes and photograph them			0
" the idea was to go to them and not to do something in a neutral place , because i wanted to feel the atmosphere of where they live , " @entity10 said			1
all of the women in the book are at least 65 years old , and some are even in their 90s			1
" we would put on the costumes and makeup , we 'd do the hair and the lights , and then suddenly they would just know how to move , " @entity10 said			1
" and they like that			0
i think there is a part of them where they are very exhibitionist			0
they like to show off and just dance and move and seduce men			0
" the poses were a collaborative effort , but @entity10 had a certain vision , too			1
" i did n't want to do something that was too close ( to what ) they were used to doing for so many years -- and that men photographers especially ask -- which is to be like a pinup like the typical @entity139 picture , " @entity10 said			1
" sometimes they would give that , and i would always kind of like twist it and say , ' let 's try something else , because this has been seen over and over again			0
' " although burlesque is n't dead -- it 's even enjoying a bit of a renaissance today -- these women represent a bygone era , and @entity10 gives them the spotlight one more time			1
" they witnessed a time that completely disappeared , and they mastered the art of striptease in a very special way , and they never really were recognized for that , " she said			0
@entity10 is a @entity160 photographer based in @entity161			1
her book " legends : the @entity165 " can be purchased through @entity164			2

@entity10 's book documents some of the legends of burlesque dancing
the women in the book , all of whom are 65 or older , represent a bygone era
but even today , they *'ve* still got plenty of sensuality and charisma
