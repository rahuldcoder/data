@entity0 -- cosmonauts walked on the surface of @entity4 on monday , nearly a year into a mission to the red planet			1
unfortunately , it 's only a simulation , designed to test what would happen on a real flight to @entity4			1
the project is an attempt to simulate the experience of a manned trip to @entity4 , with an international team of researchers locked in a windowless capsule for about a year and a half -- time required for a round trip to the next planet out in the solar system			1
starting in june of last year , the all - male " crew " of six -- three from @entity28 , one from @entity29 , one from @entity30 and one from @entity32 -- began spending 520 days in the cramped and claustrophobic conditions of a special facility in @entity0 , following a strict regimen of exercise and diet			1
they " landed " on @entity4 on saturday , and on monday , @entity28 's @entity34 and @entity30 's @entity35 completed their first walk on the " martian surface			1
" the cosmonauts wore specially modified light - weight spacesuits for the 40 - minute simulated walk			1
" for centuries @entity41 have been exploring the @entity43 , led by such people as @entity45 and @entity46			2
today , looking at the landscape of this red planet , i can imagine how exciting it would look with the eyes of the first person who steps his foot on @entity4 , " @entity35 said after he and @entity34 planted flags of the four countries participating in the project into the " martian surface			1
" two other such walks are scheduled for friday and february 22 , according to @entity58 , director of the @entity0 - based @entity59 , the main organization coordinating the project			0
organizers at the @entity62 and @entity28 's @entity63 hope the project will shed light on the physical and psychological effects of the long isolation that future @entity4 astronauts will experience			2
" this study is not useful only for @entity4 , but also for life on @entity43 , " @entity35 , 27 , said in a news release when the mission began last year			1
the researchers communicate with @entity75 via the internet , with occasional disruptions and a 20 - minute delay to imitate the effects of space travel			0
they are performing tasks similar to astronauts at the international space station , such as maintenance and scientific experiments , but for a longer period of time			0
they follow a seven - day week with two days off , except when special and emergency situations are simulated			0
the latest isolation test is the last and longest part of the @entity93 experiment , which began in 2007			2
the first phase was a 14 - day simulation that mainly tested the facilities and operational procedures			0
the second phase followed in 2009 , when four @entity28 and two @entity41 crew members were shut into the facility for 105 days			0
actual missions to @entity4 have thus far been unmanned			2
speaking at a press conference at @entity75 on monday before the walk , @entity102 , deputy head of the @entity103 , said that the " main task of the project is to determine the list of problems " that real space crews flying to @entity4 might be encountering			1
he said such a manned flight to the planet could take place in two decades			0
" twenty years is a good time to prepare for such an expedition			0
i think it is quite realistic , " he said , adding that no specific date for that is scheduled yet			0
@entity1 's @entity119 and journalist @entity120 contributed to this report			0

@entity93 is a simulated mission , designed to see how people cope with the conditions
six cosmonauts have been shut up in the simulator since june 2010
monday they pretend to walk on the surface of @entity4
