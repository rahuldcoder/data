the @entity0 and the @entity1 made clear friday what had been expected all along : attorney general @entity3 will not face criminal prosecution under the contempt of @entity7 citation passed by the @entity8			1
legal experts noted this week in the runup to thursday 's @entity8 vote that president @entity13 's assertion of executive privilege in the case would prevent a criminal prosecution under a practice dating to the @entity19 administration			1
the @entity8 also cited @entity3 for civil contempt to give it the option of filing a lawsuit compelling @entity3 to turn over documents sought by @entity25 investigators linked to the failed @entity27 weapons crackdown			1
such a case was expected to take years to complete			0
a letter friday from the @entity1 to @entity31 chairman @entity30 , who led the investigation that brought the contempt charge against @entity3 , explained that " across administrations of both political parties , the longstanding position of the @entity1 has been and remains that we will not prosecute " in such a circumstance			2
" the department will not bring the congressional contempt citation before a grand jury or take any other action to prosecute the attorney general , " concluded the letter from deputy attorney general @entity40			1
@entity0 spokesman @entity46 said the same thing friday , saying " it is an established principle , dating back to the administration of president @entity19 , that the @entity1 does not pursue prosecution in a contempt case when the president has asserted executive privilege			1
" @entity27 investigation started with agent 's death a spokesman for @entity30 's committee and another top congressional @entity59 , veteran sen. @entity60 of @entity61 , complained friday that the refusal to prosecute showed a lack of independence by the @entity66 attorney who would handle the case			2
" it is regrettable that the political leadership of the @entity1 is trying to intervene in an effort to prevent the @entity66 attorney for the @entity74 from making an independent decision about whether to prosecute this case , " said @entity68 , the panel 's director of communications			1
@entity13 asserted executive privilege on some documents sought by @entity30 's committee in its investigation of @entity27			1
the executive privilege assertion prevented the documents from being turned over on the grounds that they include internal deliberations traditionally protected from outside eyes			0
@entity86 likens @entity7 's @entity3 vote to ' evil strategies ' following reconstruction the @entity90 launched @entity27 out of @entity91 to track weapons purchases by @entity94 drug cartels			1
it followed similar programs started in the @entity98 administration			0
however , @entity27 lost track of more than 1,000 firearms it was tracking , and two of the lost weapons turned up at the scene of the 2010 killing of @entity105 agent @entity27			0
@entity30 , @entity106 , and @entity107 contend that @entity3 and the @entity1 are concealing details of how @entity27 was approved and managed			2
@entity109 argue that @entity30 and his @entity59 colleagues are using the issue to try to score political points by discrediting @entity3 and , by extension , the president in an election year			0
the showdown between @entity30 and @entity3 over the program dates to subpoenas issued last year by the @entity119 seeking a wide range of documents and other materials			0
eventually , the committee reduced its demand to focus on documents involving decision - making after the @entity27 program was shut down			0
executive privilege : a rocky legal and political road in @entity66 history in particular , the committee wanted internal documents relating to the period after february 2011 , when the @entity1 sent @entity7 an erroneous letter -- later withdrawn -- that said top officials knew nothing about @entity27 until early that year			1
on wednesday , @entity30 conceded that investigators lack any evidence that @entity3 knew of the failed weapons - tracking tactics of @entity27			1
the contempt citation , he said , was for @entity3 's failure to comply with subpoenas seeking specific documents			2
" it 's not for what the attorney general knew about @entity27 , " @entity30 said			2
" it 's about the attorney general 's refusal to provide the documents			0
" @entity46 said friday that @entity30 's comment showed the contempt citation was about politics			0
" remarkably , the chairman of the committee involved here has asserted that he has no evidence that the attorney general knew of operation @entity27 or did anything but take the right action when he learned of it			0
no evidence , " @entity46 said			0
" so if you have no evidence , as he 's stated now about the @entity0 and the attorney general , what else could this be than politics ? " in thursday 's vote on criminal contempt , @entity107 were joined by 17 @entity109 in citing @entity3 , while dozens of @entity109 walked out in protest			1
the truth about the @entity27 scandal			0

the @entity1 cites the president 's executive privilege in the case
the @entity66 @entity8 cited attorney general @entity3 for contempt of @entity7
@entity109 protested the contempt citation as a political move
