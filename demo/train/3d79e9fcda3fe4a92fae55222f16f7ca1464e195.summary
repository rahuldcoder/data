-- unable either to win the war in @entity4 by proxy or to retreat from the conflict because of the enormous blow a defeat would deliver to his regime 's legitimacy , @entity2 president @entity1 appears to be sending in regular troops to attack @entity4			1
the action is south of rebel - held @entity14 , which , until @entity2 's heightened involvement this week , was on the verge of being retaken by the @entity4 army			1
it is likely that in response to @entity2 's escalation , the @entity20 and @entity21 will contemplate more sanctions			1
the problem is that all the relatively " painless " economic measures have already been taken			0
so both the @entity20 and @entity27 are now left looking at actions that will hurt their own industries and financial institutions			1
take the previous round of sanctions , which targeted only select @entity2 banks			2
this time , it may well have to be the entire @entity2 financial system : that is , @entity20 and @entity21 banks will have to sever relations with any bank that does business with their @entity2 counterparts			1
another example : previously , only future investments in technology and transfers to the @entity2 energy sector were banned			2
now , the @entity48 may have to block the hundreds of billions of dollars in investment and equipment already in the " pipeline " to @entity2 as a result of the pre-existing contracts between the @entity2 oil giant @entity54 and its @entity56 counterparts			1
@entity57 will undoubtedly fight in international courts to overrule such bans and will also likely retaliate by curtailing gas deliveries to @entity27 , just in time for winter			0
never mind that energy exports are the backbone of the @entity2 treasury			0
as @entity1 has shown with the food import embargo , the regime is ready to harm its own people if necessary			0
which brings us to the key problem with economic sanctions : they rarely work in the short , or even medium term			0
when a regime 's popularity or even legitimacy depends on staying the course ( as it certainly does in the case of @entity4 ) and with the patriotic hysteria and paranoia whipped up by state - controlled television , @entity57 is likely to persist for a significant amount of time before sanctions show any effect			1
@entity56 leaders should therefore not oversell the sanctions ' effectiveness			0
there is , however , something the @entity48 can do to change @entity1 's mind much quicker , namely help @entity4 to win a just war against a foreign aggressor			1
sending guns and bullets is not necessary -- @entity4 has enough			2
what @entity95 needs is radar jamming and detection equipment to protect its planes from @entity2 's anti-aircraft systems ( the same kind that shot down the @entity103 airliner ) as well as purely defensive weapons such as anti-tank missiles and some intelligence sharing by the @entity48 , including satellite data			1
but perhaps just as important , as any weaker nation facing a much bigger aggressor can attest , the @entity4 need moral support			0
and nothing will boost it more than effective gestures of battlefield solidarity			0
of course , as noted earlier , retreat is not an option for @entity1			0
this is only true , however , as long as @entity2 troops do not begin to sustain significant casualties			2
the memory of the @entity122 war in @entity123 is still very much alive in the minds of the fathers and mothers of today 's soldiers			0
and , unlike the 1980s , @entity57 may not be able to engineer secret burials of zinc coffins welded shut , or force the relatives of the deceased to keep quiet			0
a video appeal by @entity2 mothers asking @entity1 to bring their sons back from the battlefield in @entity4 went viral just this week			1
one hopes , of course , that @entity2 soldiers will not have to die en masse for their commander in chief to adjust his policy			0
providing military - to - military assistance to @entity4 seems to be the only way the @entity48 can help stop this war relatively quickly			1
the alternative is the taking of ever more @entity4 and @entity2 lives -- with no end in sight .			2

@entity151 : unable to win by proxy or to retreat in @entity4 , it appears @entity1 sent troops
he says @entity20 , @entity27 mulling sanctions , but only ones left will also hurt own financial interests
he says @entity48 can help @entity4 win by sending support like radar jamming technology
@entity151 : if @entity2 sees casualties , @entity2 patriotic support for @entity1 , and war , will drop
