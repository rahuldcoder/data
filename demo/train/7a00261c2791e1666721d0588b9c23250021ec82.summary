@entity1 / @entity0 -- as diplomats at the @entity0 slammed @entity1 , violence continued to rage on the ground and residents wondered out loud what the implications of total war might be			1
" everyone we 've been talking to ... believes that the country is heading towards , or already is in , a full - blown war , and recovering from that is going to be incredibly challenging , " said @entity2 's @entity10 , who reported from inside @entity1 early tuesday			1
she spoke from an opposition safe house , describing a near constant flow of people and information			0
@entity2 is not disclosing her exact location because of concerns for her safety			1
" what a lot of people are realizing and accepting at this stage is that this is going to be bloody battle -- that more lives are going to be lost , " said @entity22			0
she reported from @entity1 one day after the @entity0 high commissioner for human rights said she is outraged by the country 's " ongoing onslaught " on its citizens			1
@entity34 spoke before the @entity35 , which could issue a formal condemnation of the @entity1 regime			1
her harsh comments prompted an angry defense from @entity1 's ambassador , who complained of an " unprecedented " media and political campaign to incite the opposition in his country			1
as they spoke , some @entity1 towns and cities came under fresh attack with soldiers going door to door rounding up civilians , rolling their tanks through towns , or continuing their shelling of neighborhoods , according to activists and residents			1
more than 680 people died last week in @entity1 , most of whom were killed in @entity60 , according to the @entity61 , a network of opposition activists			1
on monday , 30 civilians -- including two children -- were killed in violence , the @entity61 said			0
most were in the areas of @entity60 and @entity68			0
the state - run @entity69 reported a funeral was held for 19 soldiers and officers killed by terrorists throughout the country			1
@entity2 can not independently confirm details of the events in @entity1 because the government has severely limited the access of international journalists			1
" the nature and scale of abuses committed by @entity1 forces indicates that crimes against humanity are likely to have been committed since march 2011 , " @entity34 said , referring to the start of the popular uprising against the regime of @entity1 president @entity84 , which prompted his government to crack down on protesters			1
" independent , credible , and corroborated accounts indicate that these abuses have taken place as part of a widespread and systematic attack on civilians			0
" furthermore , the breadth and patterns of attacks by military and security forces on civilians and the widespread destruction of homes , hospitals , schools , and other civilian infrastructure indicate approval or complicity by the authorities at the highest levels , " @entity34 said			0
by end of the day monday , a general assembly draft resolution that would condemn @entity1 human rights violations had not been formally introduced			1
it was unclear when it would be , also when there might be a vote			0
the vote would be nonbinding but would be the strongest @entity0 statement yet on the violence			0
@entity123 and @entity124 vetoed a previous attempt by the @entity126 to condemn @entity1 for the crackdown			2
" the people of @entity1 justifiably feel that the @entity0 has shamefully abandoned their cause			2
we must , as individual member states and collectively , send them a clear signal that this is not the case , " @entity131 ambassador to the @entity0 @entity132 told diplomats			0
@entity1 's @entity0 ambassador , @entity139 , said the " aggressive , illegitimate " criticism of his country is designed to undermine the government			1
an @entity144 proposal over the weekend for a joint @entity0 - @entity144 peacekeeping force in the country is an " incitement to terrorism , " he said , because it would provide support to opposition fighters			2
@entity139 also said the proposal seeks to trample on @entity1 's sovereignty			1
" we in @entity1 could not imagine sending soldiers to defend @entity155 protesters			1
neither we or any other government can imagine sending forces to protect demonstrators in @entity160 or @entity161 , " he said			0
" the state has exclusive responsibility for defending security on its national territory			0
" @entity123 officials said monday they were studying the @entity144 proposal , but they indicated reluctance to sign on , saying the permission of the host country is necessary for peacekeepers to enter			0
a peacekeeping mission also implies there is peace first , which is not the case in @entity1 , @entity123 foreign minister @entity173 said			2
@entity124 supports the league 's mediation in @entity1 , said @entity181 spokesman @entity180 , but he stopped short of saying whether @entity182 would approve the proposal			1
along with a peacekeeping mission , the @entity144 urged member states to provide political and financial support to the @entity1 opposition and to cut ties with @entity189			2
@entity1 has said it is simply fighting armed terrorist groups in its country			1
@entity139 cited last week 's bombing of two government buildings in @entity194 , which killed 28 people , and a january bombing in @entity189 that killed 26 as examples of terrorist groups -- specifically @entity198 -- that are active in the country			1
" the vast losses in @entity1 among civilians and security forces is a deep wound , " @entity139 said			2
" we are sad , but we place the responsibility for those losses at the door of those who are attempting to obtain political interests by using @entity1 blood as currency			2
" residents of besieged @entity1 areas such as @entity60 , where hundreds have died in the past nine days , say it is civilians who are bearing the brunt of the attacks			2
they describe indiscriminate bombings of homes , snipers in the streets , arbitrary arrests and attacks on hospitals by government forces			0
the destruction by @entity84 forces has also yielded a humanitarian crisis			0
residents in @entity60 report scarce or nonexistent access to food , water and electricity			0
the @entity0 is putting humanitarian supplies in place for distribution as soon as access is granted , @entity239 , a spokesman for the @entity0 secretary - general , said monday			2
@entity243 volunteers were able to distribute food , blankets and other supplies to @entity60 and another city thanks to a brief cease - fire but say other areas are too dangerous for them to enter , the @entity241 said			0
@entity34 said most of the wounded avoid going to public hospitals for fear of being arrested or tortured			0
instead , they are being treated in underground hospitals where hygiene and sterilization conditions are rudimentary and medical supplies are scarce , she said			0
speaking in @entity259 alongside the @entity260 , @entity258 secretary of state @entity257 promised to help get aid to those wounded and dying			1
" we are increasing our funding to organizations like the @entity243 , the @entity241 for the @entity266 and we 're working directly with @entity1 organizations at the grassroots to help families who have no electricity , food or clean water , " she said			2
@entity34 said at least 5,400 people have died since protests seeking @entity84 's ouster began nearly a year ago			0
the @entity61 says the toll has far exceeded 7,000			0
@entity2 's @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity279 , @entity280 , @entity281 , and @entity282 contributed to this report .			1
