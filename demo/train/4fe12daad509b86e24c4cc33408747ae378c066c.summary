and in what might also be a landmark event , @entity3 was not flooded with jokes or parody accounts when the announcement was made two weeks ago			1
on february 11 @ davewiner tweeted , " perfect storm for @entity12 jokes			1
since he 's not dead no one can complain ' you 're being insensitive			0
' " but in the days that followed , not much surfaced			0
it was so odd that tweets like this were more common : " did i miss the memo about no @entity12 jokes ? " tweeted @ @entity22			1
although a parody account , @ @entity24 , did appear , it only has 577 followers and sent out a paltry five tweets			1
that all changed on thursday when pope @entity29 slipped off his red loafers and officially became pope emeritus			2
curiously , the @entity32 also deleted all 39 of his tweets from the official @ pontifex @entity3 account			1
( they are archived here			0
) and slowly , the jokes began to surface			0
here are a handful we found humorous			0
