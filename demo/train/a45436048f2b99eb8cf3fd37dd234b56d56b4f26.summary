-- the doctor - patient relationship is a complex one			1
it occurs at a stressful and busy time for both the patient and the doctor			1
because it involves at least two humans , there are usually at least three versions of the conversation : the doctor 's , the patient 's and the true version			1
a survey published this week in the journal @entity17 reflects this complex relationship			1
@entity19 and her colleagues surveyed 1,891 physicians nationwide about how honest they are with their patients regarding medical mistakes and a patient 's prognosis			1
the survey found that although two - thirds of doctors agree they should share serious medical errors with their patients , one - third did not completely agree			1
nearly two - fifths of the respondents said they did not disclose their financial relationships with drug and device companies			2
and more than 55 % of physicians said they often or sometimes described a patient 's prognosis in a more positive manner than the facts might support			1
these survey results are unsettling			1
we all want to think of medicine as an honorable profession and that the people in it work with integrity			2
while we should all be appalled that a doctor would deceive or lie to a patient , we should also look beyond the white coat for an explanation			1
while it is not a vindication , the fact is physicians are human			1
they have all the feelings and failings of humans			2
please keep in mind , medical errors can be due to negligence , but they are more often a failure to analyze data appropriately			1
many doctor errors are simply a matter of bad luck : the doctor was not good enough that day and would have done better the day before or the day after			1
some bad outcomes are not really the physician 's fault			2
some doctors do not admit error out of fear of litigation			1
but my experience is that the discomfort of addressing one 's own failings or weakness is more commonly the reason for not coming forward			2
it is a normal human tendency to not want to admit an error			1
confession is difficult , especially when you have to admit responsibility to the person you have hurt			0
in the case of a " bad luck " outcome , the physician may be unwilling to admit their lack of control			0
this is often due to a lack of communication during the consenting process -- when doctors explain the possible outcomes or side effects -- and can lead to patient anger when things go badly			1
ironically , when i have seen a doctor admit an error , the patient or patient 's family is usually forgiving and rarely sues			1
so why would a doctor not be honest about a patient 's disease or prognosis ? this is likely because doctors are not always the best communicators			1
medical explanations involve defining some complicated things			1
this is difficult and it is often easier to just not do it			0
sometimes there is a tendency to simplify to the point of not telling the truth			0
it is unfortunate that our medical system pays doctors handsomely to do medical procedures , but does not reimburse well for talking to , counseling and spending time with patients			1
in a normal office environment , a physician is often forced to see four or more patients per hour			0
questions go unanswered or half answered as the physician moves from room to room assessing the patient , reading a patient 's history and lab research , documenting and looking things up			0
it 's a rare private practice physician who can block extra time for a patient with special needs			0
telling a patient bad news is horribly difficult			0
it is always an emotional struggle for any caring human being			2
the emotional incentive is to hold back information or be less than honest			0
it is harder for me to tell a patient that they are dying -- and that all we can reasonably do is try to keep them comfortable -- than it is to tell a family member that a patient has died			0
as someone who studies how health care is provided and how health care is consumed , this survey 's findings do not surprise me and the solutions are not simple			2
we need to transform health care			0
this involves empowering the patient			0
patients need to take an interest in their own health			0
ask good questions and expect if not demand answers			0
some patients will need advocates or navigators to help them			0
the transformation also involves more members of the medical profession coming to realize the meaning of the term " profession			2
" a " profession " is a group of people who put their own interests secondary to the interests of the people they serve			0
a profession is also a group that educates and polices itself			0
my greatest concern is many doctors and patients fail to comprehend just how complicated medicine can be			2
even doctors fail to remember that medicine is a science and an art , often with unclear answers			1
there are things in medicine that are scientifically known , and things that are unknown			0
there are also things that are believed			0
the wise physician draws a distinction between the three			0
the unwise doctor often confuses what he believes with what he knows			2
these unwise doctors may not know they are not telling their patients the truth			2
the opinions expressed in this article do not necessarily represent those of @entity0 , @entity227 , or @entity228 .			0

survey published in @entity17 shows one third of doctors do *n't* share medical errors
results are unsettling , doctor says , but we should remember that physicians are human
doctors often try to *soften* the blow of a prognosis by not giving all the negative details
