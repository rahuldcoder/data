when @entity1 opened her mailbox last month , she got some jaw - dropping news : her insurance company , @entity4 , was cutting the 79 - year - old 's most trusted doctor from its @entity8 plan			1
in fact , four of her six regular doctors wo n't be covered at all next year			2
" i could n't believe it			2
i just could n't believe it , " @entity13 said			0
what 's easier to believe for those affected by the cuts is that because @entity19 makes it harder for insurers to cut patients from their rolls , they 're cutting doctors instead -- and hoping patients follow them off the plan			1
@entity27 's move left @entity13 and her 94 - year - old husband , @entity28 , facing a tough choice : do they stay with @entity27 and find new doctors or try to keep their doctors by finding a new insurance plan ? " dr. @entity35 has been my doctor for 20 years			1
no one knows me any better than he does , and it 's silly not to continue to go with him , " @entity13 said			0
and the insurance plan she bought is going to cost her more			1
of the eight prescriptions that @entity27 covered , half of them are either going to cost more or are n't covered at all under her new plan			1
insurers ease deadline to pay for @entity19 policies but by switching plans , @entity1 gets to keep dr. @entity35 , or " dr. @entity51 " the cardiometabolic specialist will be unceremoniously dumped from @entity27 's @entity8 network next year with little explanation			1
" given the significant changes and pressures in the health care environment , we have undertaken a review of our network and are making changes to its composition , " @entity27 wrote to @entity35 in an august letter			0
" as a result , @entity4 is amending your agreement referenced above to discontinue your participation in the @entity8 network effective on january 1 , 2014			0
... this amendment does not require your signature			0
" but the doctor thinks @entity27 is trimming physicians from its networks in hopes that their patients will follow			1
" let those high - cost patients move out of the @entity79 plan over to @entity80 or @entity81 and let those poor suckers , so to speak , pick up the cost , " @entity35 said			2
in @entity86 , where @entity35 practices outside @entity87 , hundreds of doctors and thousands of patients have been affected by @entity27 's cuts			1
and in @entity89 , @entity27 cut about 20 % of its doctors , according to the state medical society			0
the @entity93 says @entity27 and other insurers have taken similar action in at least a dozen states			1
" the patient costs a lot , " said @entity97 of the @entity98			0
" and @entity27 is going to those patients ' doctors and dropping them and therefore getting rid of the patient			0
" @entity27 concedes it is reducing the size of its @entity8 network , saying it will shrink by about 10 % to 15 % by the end of next year			0
" many health plans are making changes to their networks to improve quality and keep health insurance affordable , " @entity27 said in a statement to @entity110			1
" these changes are necessary to meet rising quality standards in an era of @entity8 funding cuts , and will improve our ability to work closely with physicians and encourage better health outcomes for our members			2
" the insurance industry 's trade group argues that the changes are a direct result of @entity19			1
to help pay for health care reform , lawmakers included $ 200 billion in cuts to the @entity8 program and a new tax on health insurers			2
" @entity134 ca n't cut and tax the @entity8 program this much and not expect seniors in the program to be harmed			0
and that 's exactly what we 're starting to see , " said @entity139 of @entity140			0
" this is just the beginning			0
as more and more of these cuts go into effect over the next several years , seniors are going to face even higher premiums , higher out - of - pocket costs for services and fewer health care choices			2
" and even though @entity13 was able to find a plan that allows her to continue to see @entity35 , she will still lose two other specialists			2
" we 're walking away from people that we 've known and trusted and counted on for over 10 years , and that 's hard , " she said			0
" @entity158 on @entity19 ad : get out of your @entity160 private exchanges : @entity19 signup process still not ready @entity165 exec to oversee @entity19 website @entity168 orders review of @entity19 website			1
