@entity0 -- @entity3 @entity2 are taking a cue from @entity5 and targeting " all the single ladies " in the hopes they can take over @entity8 held seats this november			1
party officials recognize that @entity2 ' chances of retaking control of the @entity3 are remote at best , but by zeroing - in on unmarried women , who helped propel president @entity15 to his second term , they believe they can shrink the @entity8 majority			1
@entity2 have recruited female candidates in many competitive districts , crafted a message about how the current @entity8 agenda impacts women and created a technology program designed to identify unmarried women and get them to the polls this fall			1
more than 60 % of the candidates included in the @entity3 @entity2 ' " red to blue " program - which funnels resources to top tier races - are women			1
raising money , visiting the @entity33 recently , these candidates visited @entity0 to raise money , meet with vice president @entity36 and huddle with top leaders to get campaign advice			1
@entity39 , an attorney , mom , and local elected official who is running to replace @entity8 rep. @entity42 from @entity43 , emphasized in an interview with @entity1 that she 'd be the first woman in a decade to be elected to the state 's congressional delegation , if she wins			2
" as i 'm out talking to them , they are glad to see someone who understands the issues that they are talking about - whether it 's about the economy and their families , you know -- i can relate to that , " @entity39 told @entity1			0
@entity58 sisterhood a powerful voice for the voiceless @entity62 @entity2 candidate @entity61 , a former member of the @entity63 , touts her role pushing through @entity62 's first statewide equal pay bill in 2009			2
she says @entity62 has never elected a woman to a federal office , a fact she says she uses in her message to voters			0
" you 're looking at a woman who is going to go out there and fight for you			2
so it gives you a strong reason to vote for somebody , " @entity61 told @entity1			0
democratic candidate @entity77 is facing @entity78 @entity8 rep. @entity8 , and says she and other female candidates are an antidote to the dysfunction in @entity0			1
" we have bipartisan record of really getting things done			0
we have a guy who is just sitting in @entity0 just voting ' no ' on everything and people want to see some change			2
they 're tired of the fighting - we can make a difference , " @entity89 said			0
dems see an opening the results of the 2012 election show why @entity2 believe they have an opening if they concentrate on single women			1
according to @entity1 's exit polls , unmarried women were about one quarter of the electorate in 2012 , which was a record high			0
in that election , single women voted 68 % -31 % for @entity2 over republicans in congressional contests			1
@entity2 admit they ca n't replicate that level in a non-presidential year , but they believe boosting turnout in several dozen districts can overtake the advantage republicans traditionally have among married women			1
the @entity3 @entity2 campaign arm is using the playbook developed by @entity116 's @entity2 gov. @entity115 in his victorious 2013 campaign			1
@entity115 lost among men , but won the election because women supported him over the then - attorney general @entity121 by 9 points			0
among unmarried women , the margin was more dramatic -- @entity115 prevailed 67 % -25 %			0
the campaign committee created " rosie , " a voter modeling program named after the iconic @entity129 " @entity128 , " which they say stands for " reengaging our sisters in elections			0
" this program culls data to identify unmarried voters , and then targets messages using email , paid mail and social media to motivate them to vote in november			0
the task to get these women motivated enough to go to the polls will be tough			0
women building : @entity8 - led @entity3 to vote on women 's museum seeking a narrative a poll released last month by @entity148 , a @entity2 leaning group , projects a 20 - point drop off in unmarried female voters from 2012 to 2014			1
after seeing the impact of what happened in the 2010 midterm election when many women stayed home and @entity8 gained the majority , @entity2 candidates are talking about issues that hit unmarried women 's pocketbooks -- an increase in the minimum wage , an extension for jobless benefits and legislation promoting equal pay			1
democrats do n't have the power in the @entity3 to move legislation on any of these items			2
but their campaign strategy includes turning losing battles on the @entity3 floor into a narrative to argue that @entity3 @entity8 members are ignoring issues that these women care about			1
" as long as @entity8 keep blocking equal pay for equal work , restricting women 's health choices and delaying the @entity182 , women will continue to run - and win - as @entity2 , " @entity3 @entity2 campaign chairman @entity177 told @entity1			1
but @entity184 @entity8 rep. @entity183 , who is helping with the @entity3 @entity8 effort dubbed " @entity186 " to expand the party 's female ranks in the @entity3 , told @entity1 that unmarried and married women care about the same issue this year -- jobs			1
she predicted this fall female voters overall will line up with the @entity8 economic agenda that includes job training , education , fixing the problems with @entity197 , and creating more energy jobs			2
" we 're doers and we want to get things done			0
we want solutions , and we think we have message that resonates with all women , " @entity200 told @entity1			0
as @entity115 did in @entity116 last year , @entity3 @entity2 candidates are painting their @entity8 opponents with the broad brush of being right - wing ideologues that will endanger the priorities of women			1
@entity89 said of @entity8 rep. @entity8 , " he 's completely tea party - he 's the most extreme in @entity212 on his labor votes , on his shutdown votes , it 's just across the board			2
" even if this group of female candidates does get elected to the @entity3 they will likely enter @entity58 as members of the minority - and the least senior			2
but they do n't see that dynamic as a problem because they still believe they can have an impact serving their constituents			0
" i think electing more women and more people who want come up here and get things done -- that is what makes a difference			0
we 're trying to change the environment			0
meet the woman who could turn @entity236 purple			0

party officials recognize that @entity2 chances of retaking the @entity3 are remote at best
but they 're recruiting women candidates in many competitive districts to win over some @entity8 seats
recently , these candidates visited @entity0 to raise money and meet with *vp* @entity36
