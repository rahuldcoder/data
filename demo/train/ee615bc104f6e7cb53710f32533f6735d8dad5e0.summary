on wednesday the @entity1 @entity24 in @entity25 also condemned the @entity28 church 's plan to burn the @entity29 , the @entity9 holy book , as " disrespectful , intolerant and divisive , " in a statement			1

the pastor of the church , @entity41 , told @entity0 tuesday his flock was taking the warning seriously but had not decided to cancel the event , planned for september 11			1
@entity41 , pastor of @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity28 , told @entity0 's " @entity47 : " we have firmly made up our mind , but at the same time , we are definitely praying about it			1
" later tuesday , @entity41 had a response to the statement from @entity34			2
" the general needs to point his finger to radical @entity56 and tell them to shut up , tell them to stop , tell them that we will not bow our knees to them , " @entity41 said on @entity0 's " @entity53			1
" " we are burning the book , " @entity41 said			2
" we are not killing someone			0
we are not murdering people			0
" the planned action has drawn sharp criticism from @entity9 around the world and from @entity1 officials			1
the @entity1 @entity24 in @entity70 , @entity33 , on tuesday issued a statement saying the @entity1 government " in no way condones such acts of disrespect against the religion of @entity56 , and is deeply concerned about deliberate attempts to offend members of religious or ethnic groups			1
" it emphasized that it strongly condemned " the offensive messages , which are contrary to @entity1 government policy and deeply offensive to @entity9 especially during the month of @entity15			2
" with about 120,000 @entity1 and @entity83 - led troops still battling @entity84 and its allies in the @entity56 fundamentalist @entity87 movement , @entity34 warned that burning @entity5 " is precisely the kind of action the @entity87 uses and could cause significant problems -- not just here , but everywhere in the world we are engaged with the @entity56 community			1
" @entity34 said he was concerned about the political repercussions of the church 's plan			1
" even the rumor that it might take place has sparked demonstrations such as the one that took place in @entity70 yesterday , " he said			0
" were the actual burning to take place , the safety of our soldiers and civilians would be put in jeopardy and accomplishment of the mission would be made more difficult			2
" thousands of @entity114 gathered outside the @entity24 in @entity115 , @entity114 , on sunday to protest the planned @entity29 burning			1
" the burning is not only an insult to the holy quran , but an insult to @entity56 and @entity9 around the world , " said @entity120 , a spokesman for the hard - line @entity114 @entity9 group @entity121			1
@entity41 said his congregation was aware that the action was offensive			2
" we realize that this action would indeed offend people , offend the @entity9			0
i am offended when they burn the flag			0
i am offended when they burn the @entity131			0
but we feel that the message that we are trying to send is much more important than people being offended			0
" @entity41 said @entity9 are welcomed in the @entity1 , if they observe the @entity134 and do n't try to impose @entity136 law , or @entity9 law			2
the message , he said , is directed toward the " radical element of @entity56			1
" " our message is very clear , " he said			0
" it is not to the moderate @entity9			0
our message is not a message of hate			0
our message is a message of warning to the radical element of @entity56 , and i think what we see right now around the globe provides exactly what we 're talking about , " he said			1
the center says it was founded in 1986 as a " total concept church for the rich , the poor , the young and the old			0
" its purpose is to " stand up for righteousness and for the truth of the @entity131			0
" it stresses that " @entity155 must return to the truth and stop hiding			0
" " we need to speak up against sin and call the people to repentance			0
we need to call these things what they are and bring the world the true message : that @entity171 is the way , the truth , and the life , " it says on the church 's website			1
it also emphasizes its dislike of @entity56 , and on its website , it blog posts an item called " ten reasons to burn a @entity29			2
" any religion which would profess anything other than this truth is of the devil			0
this is why we also take a stand against @entity56 , which teaches that @entity171 is not the @entity187 , therefore taking away the saving power of @entity171 and leading people straight to @entity190 , " the site says			2
