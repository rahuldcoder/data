-- lucky fans were treated to the first ever footage from upcoming teen dystopic film " divergent " at @entity3 yesterday			2
the primary cast of the film , as well as director @entity8 ( " @entity10 " ) and book author @entity9 , spoke about the film 's potential as the so - called next " @entity13 " and offered hints about what 's to come from the franchise			1
the futuristic film stars @entity17 as a teenager named @entity19 who is forced to decide between the societal faction her family belongs to and the one she feels is right for her			1
it will be released in theaters on march 21 , 2014			2
@entity17 , who finished filming only two days prior to @entity3 , is already preparing for the wash of fame that will follow should the movie be a success			1
@entity31 talks ' @entity29 ' " i did audition for ' @entity35 ' back in the day , " @entity17 told reporters at a press conference on thursday , july 18			1
" @entity36 actually helped me with ' divergent ' because i asked her to tell me how her life has changed from going from small indie movies to something as big as ' @entity13			1
' and she gave me really beautiful advice saying how much she appreciated it and how much it 's changed her life in positive ways			2
she really helped me on this journey			2
" the actress cited filming the book 's integral scene on @entity48 's famous @entity47 -- @entity49 as her favorite moment in the film -- as well as one of her favorite moments in her life			2
the big - budget , action - based picture is a far cry from some of @entity17 's previous roles , which include " the @entity59 " and next month 's " @entity60			1
" for the actress and her co-stars , many of whom are largely unknown actors , " divergent " was a chance to experience new methods of filmmaking			0
" green - screen acting is by far way more difficult than human interaction , " @entity17 said			1
" i 'd never done a movie of this scale before with themes that are somewhat different than the world we live in today			0
so it was challenging for me i found because i had to erase my previous notions of acting , which is generally reacting off of somebody else , and create a new world and adapt my style of artistry to what we were doing			0
" an adaptation of the series ' second book , " insurgent , " is expected for 2015			0
@entity9 said she has been present on set and feels that the film remains true to her original text			0
the author confirmed that the final book , " @entity93 , " will be written from two perspectives : @entity19 and her love interest four , who is played in the film by @entity96			0
but since the third book in the series will be released october 22 , 2013 , the actors and filmmakers still do n't know the final fate of the characters			0
" not everyone on this panel lives , " said @entity103 , who plays @entity104 , as he motioned to the 10 cast members at the press conference			1
" but i 'm excited			0
