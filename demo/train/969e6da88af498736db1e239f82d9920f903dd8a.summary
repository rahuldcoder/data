-- the first season of @entity4 's @entity3 drama " @entity5 " bitterly divided viewers : some embraced its depiction of the fast - paced world of cable news			1
others found it overwrought and tuned in to " hate - watch " as the show dramatized current events to reveal the inner workings of the media			2
" @entity5 " returns for season two on sunday , and according to @entity19 , who plays crotchety tv news anchor @entity20 , the show has found its groove			1
when we last left @entity20 , he was comparing the @entity25 tea party to the @entity27 @entity26 on television			1
the season two opener takes place just a few weeks later , and @entity20 is facing the consequences of his words			1
over the course of the 10 new episodes , the series will explore themes like @entity37 and a fictional story that rocks the network called @entity41			1
@entity19 spoke with @entity0 about getting back into character , @entity20 's googling habits and his next project : the long - rumored sequel to the 1994 comedy " @entity47			1
" @entity0 : where do we find @entity20 at the beginning of season two ? @entity19 : @entity20 is trying to get his life back together			1
he 's hoping ( the @entity24 uproar ) blows over eventually and he can go back to doing what he does in the way that he likes to do it			2
but the @entity41 story takes over			1
and what they do in the @entity41 story makes what he did with the @entity24 pale in comparison			1
@entity0 : as an actor , what was interesting about playing @entity20 this season ? @entity19 : the most exciting thing for me was that i knew who he was , going in			1
when you go from movie to movie to movie , you 're creating different characters every time , and you 're discovering them each time			0
for all the actors ( on " @entity5 " ) , we made a lot of those discoveries on season one			1
season one really was , for @entity4 ( @entity4 ) on down , a first draft			1
we 're a lot of really smart people who have done really successful things over the years , but we were still guessing			0
so season two really felt like i knew the guy			2
it was a whole different way of walking into a scene and feeling like the character was very familiar			2
@entity0 : will this season center on any big newsworthy moments , like the 2012 presidential election ? @entity19 : there are some , yeah			1
we certainly are covering the primaries and the leadup to the election			0
but mainly , it 's this @entity41 story , a fictional story that the network is chasing			1
the other stories , while they do pop up , are more secondary			0
@entity0 : it seems like fans of " @entity5 " are really interested in knowing how closely your own views align with your character 's			1
is that something you feel the need to address ? @entity19 : they are fascinated by that , are n't they ? it seems really important that they know			2
i can see why they would want to know that			0
you know what 's more important ? what @entity20 thinks			1
let me put it this way : i 'm doing some acting			0
@entity0 : are you familiar with the @entity129 account someone started ? @entity19 : if @entity20 were real , i think he would be thrilled			1
i have a @entity129 account , but i do n't dare look at what anyone twits me -- i ca n't say tweets , so i say twits			0
i ca n't even bear it			0
i 've never googled , myself so i 'm not about to scroll through what people are sending my way			0
i was aware that there is a @entity142 account and maybe even a @entity20 account			2
have i been to it ? no. will would			0
@entity20 loves to @entity145 himself			2
@entity0 : there 's a really notable balance on the show between the serious high stakes of the newsroom and humorous moments			2
why is that important ? @entity19 : it 's like life , where people say these very funny things right before they do very serious stuff			1
humor is what keeps us sane			0
it 's very smart humor			2
these people get each other 's jokes			0
it 's these human beings with weaknesses and senses of humor			0
that 's what @entity4 does well : he writes complete people with flaws			1
it 's coming from these people that , to us as we 're doing it , feel real			0
@entity0 : do you have any sense of whether the newsroom on the show is true to the feeling of an actual newsroom ? @entity19 : we 're not shooting a documentary			1
i imagine that on a breaking news day , our fictionalized version comes close			0
when you dramatize something and put cameras in front of it , you take out the boring parts			0
i have a feeling that it 's probably relatively authentic , which is what we 're going for			0
@entity0 : did you spend any time in a newsroom or with real reporters to prepare for the role of @entity20 ? @entity19 : no. it was frightening how little research i did for this			1
i did think about all those newsrooms i 've been in over the years promoting movies			0
it 's not the same as being there when there 's breaking news , but it 's certainly helpful			2
i felt like i had enough of an awareness of what was going on to make up the rest			0
that 's where the joy of acting comes , the making up the rest			0
if you 've researched something to the end of its life , it becomes math. and i 'm not good at math. i really like the " what if " of it all			0
@entity0 : on a less highbrow note , what 's the status of the " @entity47 " sequel ? @entity19 : we 're told that " @entity237 " could be shooting in september , and i hope it does			1
and if it is , i 'll be having a lot of fun with @entity241 this fall			0
and then i 'd hopefully come back for " @entity5 's " season three			1
@entity0 : will that transition from " @entity5 " to " @entity237 " be strange ? @entity19 : well , the drop in intelligence is more than a little frightening			1
to go from @entity20 's iq to @entity247 's , which i believe is an iq of eight			2
that 's quite a drop			0
my fear is that if we do come back for a third season that there will be portions of @entity247 that creep into @entity20 , and i do n't think that serves " @entity5 " well			1
i love that a to z range , but you want people to see each character separately , not @entity20 with a stupid haircut			2
@entity0 : do you know the storyline for " @entity237 " ? @entity19 : yes , but i ca n't say			2
i 've read it ; it 's hysterical			0
it takes place a year after the first film , and they have n't missed a beat			0
what 's great is that @entity241 and i are definitely middle - aged and not pretending to be the same age -- and we 're still that stupid .			0
