@entity0 -- army secretary @entity2 ordered a new investigation into poor record keeping and other problems at @entity6 even as a separate investigation ended without an absolute answer to who is buried in a grave marked " unknown			1
" " as the final resting place of our nation 's heroes , any questions about the integrity or accountability of its operations should be examined in a manner befitting their service and sacrifice , " @entity2 said in a statement after signing the order directing the @entity14 's inspector general to begin an investigation into allegations regarding cemetery operations			1
the @entity14 @entity30 is already in the middle of an investigation ordered by the previous secretary of the @entity14 to review management of the cemetery			1
in recent years , the cemetery -- where president @entity37 and thousands of fallen @entity39 soldiers , sailors , airmen and @entity42 are buried -- has had a number of embarrassing problems			1
in 2008 , the cemetery discovered that workers inadvertently buried cremated remains at a grave site already in use			1
those remains were moved to another grave site			2
in 2003 , as workers were digging a grave for a new burial , they discovered a casket already buried there			0
there was no headstone or grave marker to indicate who			0
only recently , after a report by a journalist at @entity64 , did the @entity14 take action on the problem			0
over the summer , the cemetery put up a headstone on the mystery grave that reads " unknown			1
" as @entity2 ordered the new investigation , the @entity14 released results of a separate investigation of problems at the cemetery			1
that investigation focused on the discovery of the " unknown " grave			2
a spokesman for the @entity79 of @entity0 , which conducted the review , said " cemetery records , the @entity83 investigation , and the non-invasive geophysical analysis of the grave sites strongly indicate that a husband and wife , who died years apart and should have been buried in the same grave site , were instead buried in adjacent graves			1
" a dna test of the remains in the two adjacent graves could prove conclusively that is what happened , but the family of the husband and wife did not wish for their remains to be disturbed			0
the @entity83 said the @entity14 will abide by the family 's wishes and has ordered a headstone to properly mark the wife 's grave			0
one of the problems discovered by the @entity83 investigation was a possible lack of adequate staffing at the cemetery			2
last year @entity6 conducted 4,377 burials , up more than 21 percent over the past 10 years			0
during that same period the number of civilian staff members has dropped nearly 19 percent			0
currently the cemetery has four employees to schedule 135 to 150 funerals a week as well as maintain all grave records			0
@entity6 , which sits on a hill across the @entity115 from the @entity116 , has been the final resting place for @entity39 's military heroes since the @entity119 , when the @entity120 seized the estate from the family of @entity124 gen. @entity123			0
@entity2 hopes this new investigation will " ensure @entity39 's confidence in the operation of its most hallowed ground			2
