-- at first it may seem " 24 's " @entity3 did n't get the memo			1
in 2014 , our heroes now wear capes and fight the bad guys at the box office , while the small screen has been taken over by a gang of antiheroes			0
from " scandal " and " @entity16 " to " @entity17 " and " @entity18 , " the recent slate of leading men are n't as interested in saving the world as they are in saving themselves			2
yet on monday night ( may 5 ) , counterterrorism agent @entity3 will return in @entity22 's " 24 " event series , " 24 : @entity23			1
" he 's once again played by @entity25 and is as determined as ever to do the right thing			0
those around @entity3 may question which side he 's on , but viewers have always known him as the guy willing to do anything ( and we mean anything ) for what he sees as the greater good			1
in a tv world filled with monsters and @entity38 , where does @entity3 fit in ? in a sense , the 12 - episode " 24 : @entity23 " is asking that very question			1
when " 24 " ended in 2010 , @entity3 was still alive but a fugitive			1
in its two - hour premiere , " 24 : @entity23 " picks up four years later with a hardened , angrier @entity3 living in exile as a presumed threat to the @entity47 government			1
" he 's actually working on his own , but the people that he 's trying to help are actually hunting him and they 're trying to either kill him or arrest him , " @entity25 told @entity0 in a press call			0
" he 's had to hide in @entity51 for four years			0
he 's been estranged from his daughter and grandchildren , he has not been able to go back to the country that he feels he served			0
that kind of isolation has made him really hard			0
" and yet , as executive producers @entity57 and @entity59 point out , he 'll still jump at the chance to stop another attempt on a president 's life without asking , as many of our favorite characters would today , what 's in it for him			0
" @entity3 is an individual who has saved his country numerous times and now that country has turned his back on him , " @entity59 said			1
" on the outside ( he 's ) changed and has a darker view of humanity and the people around him , but at his core has maintained his love of country and what he 's always fought for			0
" that core is undoubtedly part of what made audiences root for the impossibly unstoppable federal agent when " 24 " debuted in 2001			2
with a premiere date that came just weeks after the september 11 attacks , " 24 " greeted tv viewers badly in need of a hero			1
" he was a man who got things done at a time when that was all this country wanted , " observed @entity91 ' tv critic @entity90			2
" i do n't think @entity25 cracked a smile during the entire run of ' 24			1
' he was all business			0
" at the time , the series was one of a few new programs focusing on the @entity102 , but " 24 " was unique in its setup			1
each week 's episode covered one hour of a very long , very bad day for @entity3 , with the conceit that all the events viewers were watching were happening in real time			2
although the series was shot five months prior to the september 11 attacks , that event seemed to rule out " 24 's " success , @entity25 said			1
( it 's not surprising he assumed as much , given that " 24 's " premiere episode featured a terrorist placing a bomb on a plane			2
) " after that terrible day we personally thought the show was over and we should n't do it because it was too close to something that had really happened , " @entity25 said			2
" we were very surprised to see the audience reaction ... to the show early on			0
somehow there was something that made @entity3 's character quite cathartic			1
" to producer @entity57 , audiences have connected with @entity3 because he 's " selfless in a way that a lot of the other characters are n't			1
he 's not ambitious , he does n't care about what happens to him , " the producer said			2
while that may make him unique in today 's tv world , at the very least it 'll help him stand apart			0
" he 's definitely a singular character , " @entity57 noted			0
" no one is occupying the same pace			0
" now with his return , there 's another fight that @entity3 is facing that has nothing to do with a world leader			2
the question of whether audiences are interested in welcoming back this gun - toting archetype , and whether this event series will be a success or a disappointment for @entity22 , does n't have a straightforward answer , said @entity152 's @entity151			1
the tv critic was n't that impressed with " 24 's " new event series , noting that it " does n't in any way reinvent the show			1
" although , @entity151 continued , that may be enough for fans who are content to watch what they would 've seen in the mid- 2000s " in a more truncated form			0
" for @entity25 , the concern is less about ratings and the possibility that there could be more " 24 " on the horizon as it is about doing justice to the man he brought to life for nine years			0
during production on the event series , which is set and shot in @entity176 , " we became so focused on trying to make these the best episodes of ' 24 ' period , " @entity25 said			1
" i feel very , very strong about the first eight episodes that we have completed			0
now we just need to really bring it home			0

@entity3 returns to tv with event series " 24 : @entity23 "
the character does n't quite fit the *current* antihero trend
but the reason he became so *popular* is because of his " get it done " *attitude*
