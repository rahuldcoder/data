@entity0 -- @entity5 director @entity4 has cooperated properly with congressional investigators looking into the prostitution scandal in @entity8 last month before president @entity10 's visit , influential @entity3 members said wednesday			1
rep. @entity11 , the chairman of the @entity12 , said @entity4 provided answers to 50 questions from his panel about the controversy in @entity17 that embarrassed the nearly 150 - year - old agency and raised concerns of a possible security breach			1
" i got the answers back last night , and i would say the answers were very detailed , " @entity11 said on @entity1 's " @entity21 with @entity22			1
" in addition , @entity11 said , @entity4 notified the @entity27 's inspector general when the scandal became public in mid-april , " which showed that he wanted a real investigation			1
" also wednesday , the @entity32 's leading members said @entity4 provided a " detailed response " to their separate list of questions about the incident			2
" director @entity4 's cooperation with our oversight efforts underscores his commitment to understand the extent of the problem and ensure that this unacceptable conduct does not occur again , " said a statement by the panel 's chairman , @entity40 , @entity41 , and ranking @entity42 , @entity43 of @entity44			2
even @entity54 sen. @entity53 of @entity55 , a frequent critic of government resistance to congressional oversight , praised @entity4 's response to his request for details of any possible involvement of @entity3 advance team staff in the scandal			1
@entity53 is demanding that the @entity3 turn over all details of an internal review that found no wrongdoing by advance staff members , and he renewed his call wednesday after receiving @entity4 's response that the @entity5 inquiry did n't involve @entity3 records			1
" since the @entity5 did not request the records of the @entity3 personnel , an open and transparent response from the president 's counsel is even more imperative , " @entity53 said in a statement			1
" unfortunately , more than a week after my inquiry , i 've yet to hear from anybody at the @entity3			1
i appreciate the @entity5 's transparency in response to @entity82 , even with sensitive information			0
" @entity11 said tuesday night that @entity4 's answers to his committee 's questions disclosed that three of the 12 @entity5 agents involved in the scandal had refused to cooperate with authorities and submit to a polygraph test			1
the three agents were among the first forced out of the service when news of the scandal in @entity17 broke , @entity11 said			1
the nine remaining agents took polygraph tests , and although none of them failed , some responses led to the loss of several jobs , he added			0
on wednesday morning , @entity11 said that no security breach occurred from the @entity5 agents consorting with foreign prostitutes in their hotel rooms shortly before @entity10 's arrival in @entity17 for last month 's @entity107			1
" we know that it appears that no material was obtained by any of the prostitutes			0
all the @entity113 are accounted for			0
there was no president 's schedule available , " @entity11 said			1
" it does not appear that any of the 12 women had any involvement other than prostitution , " @entity11 added			1
" they were not working for any narco - terrorist organization , and i think in a way the @entity5 has ducked a bullet			2
" still , @entity11 said , the incident " goes against all the principles of the @entity5			1
" " because it was disclosed and there was no long - term security matter here , it gives the @entity5 the opportunity to clear up what has happened , do all it can to make sure it never happens again or at least minimizes it to make it very , very difficult for it to ever happen again , " he said			1
while @entity11 did not provide @entity1 copies of the responses -- which he said are marked " law enforcement sensitive " -- he highlighted several details tuesday night			1
among other things , one agent said in the polygraph test that he was " actively engaged " with one of the prostitutes when she wanted to get paid , @entity11 said			1
in response , the agent threw her out of his room			0
the agent told @entity147 officials he did n't realize the woman was a prostitute , and he has not been fired			0
@entity147 officials have interviewed 10 of the 12 women involved in the scandal , @entity11 noted			1
the @entity5 and @entity8 authorities are trying to track down the remaining two			1
@entity11 said there were n't many surprises in the responses to his questionnaire			2
" @entity4 was giving us good information all along , " he said			0
the top legislators on the @entity159 said tuesday that they 've also sent a letter to @entity4 asking for information on the incident			2
a total of nine agents have resigned or are in the process of being forced out , while three other @entity5 agents were cleared of serious misconduct			0
a source familiar with the investigation told @entity1 on wednesday that money changed hands between nine @entity5 members and nine prostitutes			0
the military is investigating the alleged involvement of 12 of its service members			0
@entity40 and @entity43 also have asked defense secretary @entity177 to provide details of the military investigation by may 8			0
two other congressional committees are looking into the scandal , as well as the @entity27 inspector general , while the @entity5 and the @entity3 have conducted internal reviews			1
on monday , @entity27 acting inspector general @entity184 announced his investigation of the incident , saying the " field work is beginning immediately			2
" the @entity188 questioned homeland security secretary @entity189 about the controversy at a hearing last week			2
on tuesday , sen. @entity192 , an independent from @entity194 who chairs the @entity196 , and ranking @entity54 sen. @entity197 said they sent @entity4 a letter monday that also sought answers about what happened			2
" we wish to determine whether those events were indicative of a pattern of behavior by agents or officers of the @entity5 and need to be addressed systemically or if they instead constituted an isolated incident warranting action only with respect to the individuals involved , " said the letter from @entity192 and @entity202			2
the @entity216 expects to finish questioning the 12 military personnel implicated in possible wrongdoing this week before forwarding its findings to military lawyers for review and then to gen. @entity222 , commanding general of the @entity216 , a @entity215 official said monday			0
last week , the @entity5 distributed new rules for its agents on assignment intended to prevent a repeat of such alleged misconduct , according to two government sources familiar with the resulting investigation			0
@entity234 , the new guidelines given to all @entity5 personnel , make clear that standards of behavior required in the @entity147 apply on missions abroad , the sources said			0
effective immediately , the new standards require detailed briefings before each trip that will include safety precautions and any necessary designations of establishments and areas that are " off - limits " for @entity5 personnel , the sources said			2
also in the new standards , foreigners are banned from @entity5 hotel rooms at all times , except for hotel staff and host nation law enforcement and government officials on official business , according to the officials , and all @entity5 personnel are prohibited from going to a " nonreputable establishment			0
" the new standards specify that @entity147 laws apply to @entity5 personnel when traveling , rendering invalid the excuse that specific activity is legal in the foreign country , the officials said			0
in addition , the new guidelines allow moderate alcohol consumption when off duty but prohibit alcohol consumption within 10 hours of reporting for duty or at any time when at the hotel where the protected official is staying , the officials explained			0
an additional supervisor from the @entity271 will now accompany the " jump teams " that bring vehicles for motorcades and other transportation , the officials said			0
agents involved in the @entity8 incident were part of such a jump team			1
allegations of further transgressions by agents have emerged after the initial reports of heavy drinking and consorting with prostitutes last month before @entity10 arrived in @entity17			0
recent claims include an account from @entity288 described by @entity290 affiliate @entity289 as very similar to the @entity8 scandal , involving members of the @entity5 and other government agencies			1
however , @entity177 said last week that his department is not investigating any of its troops over the reported incident in @entity288 , while @entity298 spokesman @entity297 said @entity300 staff in @entity288 were being questioned about the allegations			2
the @entity306 also is prepared to look into , " in an appropriate manner and immediately , " allegations that it deems " credible " regarding its agents in @entity288 , spokesman @entity302 said			0
but he added that , while the @entity306 had seen news reports , " we are unaware of any allegations of misconduct			0
" @entity1 's @entity312 , @entity313 , @entity314 , @entity315 , @entity316 , @entity317 and @entity318 contributed to this report .			0
