-- when researchers at @entity3 set out to study top - level leadership within a major organization , it would have been easy to focus on a high - flying ceo from the commercial or financial worlds			0
instead , the academics cast convention aside and approached a football manager with an avowed commitment to socialism -- sir @entity13			1
the former @entity15 manager is one of the most successful coaches of all time , winning a veritable treasure trove of trophies and championships in a managerial career that stretched across five decades			0
all very impressive , but what could @entity13 possibly know about business leadership that would be of use to an in - depth study on the subject ? see also : there 's no escape from robo - boss quite a lot according to management consultant and author , @entity33 , who has spent the past year interviewing top - level soccer managers , including @entity13 , for his book , " the manager : inside @entity37 "			1
" people think football is about buying and selling players and picking the team , but actually that is just a relatively small part of it , " @entity33 explained			1
" it 's also about how do i lead myself ? how do i lead my team ? and how do i lead others ? " " whether you 're leading a football club and all the infrastructure behind that ... or whether you 're leading an executive company , the human skills are quite similar , " he added			2
tactical game like the researchers who studied @entity13 at close quarters and invited him to speak at @entity3 last year , @entity33 draws parallels between the best ceos and football managers in how they strive to introduce long term structures and values to foster a culture of success			1
he also points out the similarities in managing top talent , developing an effective one - to - one leadership style as well as taking into account the needs of different interests groups within an organization			0
this final quality is something the best soccer managers do particularly well , @entity33 noted			1

" " no - one gets it right all the time ; and for the managers of the big clubs and national teams , the stakes are very high indeed			0
the likes of @entity98 , @entity99 and recently sir @entity13 are under constant press and media scrutiny , and have frequent high - profile and high - impact dealings with press , club owners , agents and top talent , high - priced players , " he added			1
contrasting styles yet despite these broad similarities , the day - to - day methods used to nurture relationships in sport and business will in most cases be vastly different			0
@entity118 's often barbed public attitude towards officialdom and competitors , for example , would unlikely meet the level of decorum expected of a public facing ceo or executive			2
sir @entity13 's infamous hairdryer treatment ( where he stands inches away from a players face and screams at the top of his voice ) or the temperamental touchline persona of @entity132 head - coach , @entity131 , meanwhile hardly seem suited to the more refined sensibilities of the business world			1
according to professor @entity136 , dean of @entity138 's business school , however , these emotional techniques still display leadership attributes that businesspeople can adapt for their own purposes			2
see also : neurotics shine over time in team settings " [ one of the main ] things those in business can learn from leaders in sport is passion , " @entity136 explained			0
" many top sports coaches have this , but so few business leaders display it openly in their organizations or externally			0
" in this regard , @entity136 says there is " a huge amount that businesspeople can take from those in sport			0
i do n't think enough of that goes on as it is			0
" transferring skills perhaps one of the main reasons for this lack of learning across football and business is the fact that so few have operated at the sharp end of both disciplines			1
one man who has is former @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 defender , @entity172			2
the former @entity177 international founded his own asset management firm , @entity178 , in 2009 after hanging up boots several years previously			0
his organization now looks after $ 1 billion of clients ' funds under advisory management , according to a 2012 profile in the @entity185			0
although never a football manager himself , @entity172 spent more than 15 years studying at the feet of inspirational coaches such as @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 which he said prepared him for the rigors of leading a successful company			1
" there are similarities between the two ( football and business ) as you always have pressure to perform , " he said			2
" on the football side this is something that you can really bring over into the business world as you are trained from a very young age to cope with major pressure			1
" see also : is investing in a college degree worth it ? like @entity33 and @entity136 before him , however , @entity172 highlights the ability to deal with people on an individual level as the major similarity between leadership roles in the two fields			1
he believes those in business can glean much from football if they were to analyze the methods and behavior of leading coaches			1
" people skills in any form of management are about 80 % to 90 % the most important part of the job , " @entity172 said			2
" of course you also have to have knowledge and know - how of a specific industry as well , but if you have these skills and effective communication then people will do the job for you very well			2
" if managers take the time to think about it and see the positions of people then they can only learn a lot from the sports world , " he added .			0

football managers can offer valuable insight into leadership , says author @entity33
sir @entity13 , @entity118 and @entity251 all exhibit powerful leadership traits , @entity33 states
*ex-player* @entity172 believes communication skills gleaned in the football world can be transferred to business
