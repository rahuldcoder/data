@entity1 , @entity0 -- you might have thought that recycling is limited to paper , plastics and glass			2
a @entity9 company is developing a new technique for recycling carbon dioxide , or @entity12 , and turning it back into fuel			1
@entity14 are developing a " breakthrough technology " to make fuel out of waste co2			1
@entity14 believe they have made a breakthrough with their technology , which they say can transform co2 back into basic fuel building blocks efficiently			1
their biocatalytic process converts co2 into basic hydrocarbons - @entity23 ( methane ) @entity25 ( ethane ) and @entity27 ( propane ) -- which can then be utilized to make higher - grade fuels like gasoline and jet fuel			1
" we are very excited by what we 've seen in the lab. we 've had some promising results , " @entity32 , president and ceo of the @entity36 - based company , told @entity2			2
by employing biocatalysis -- using natural catalysts to perform chemical reactions -- @entity14 hope to bypass the problem of inefficient energy ratios which can render many co2 recycling projects pointless			1
" we do n't use high temperatures or high pressures , which is a huge advantage in terms of scaling the project up , " @entity32 said			0
in the future , @entity32 envisages @entity14 setting up shop next door to large co2 emitters -- coal , gas - fired plants and oil refineries -- recycling concentrated streams of co2 discharged from fossil fuel plants			1
trying to take co2 out of natural air just would n't be worth it			2
" the beauty of this system is the whole infrastructure to distribute , to market and to use it is already in place , " he said			0
the recycling process has five main stages			2
after rudimentary purification and regeneration of the biocatalysts , the @entity12 is transferred to a @entity76 where mass quantities of biocatalysts function in a matrix of liquid reaction chambers breaking down @entity12 and turning it into hydrocarbons			0
liquids are then filtered and gases are extracted through condensers ready for conversion to higher grade fuel			2
@entity14 are just one of many companies all over the world who are beavering away trying to find effective methods of renewing @entity12			1
the science is well known , but practical energy effective devices are in short supply			2
scientists at @entity96 in @entity97 are exploring the idea of using concentrated solar energy to turn co2 into fuel			1
the @entity102 to @entity104 project is testing a prototype device called the @entity106 ( called @entity107 for short ) which turns co2 into carbon monoxide which could then form part of a liquid fuel			1
others , like @entity112 , professor of @entity113 at @entity114 in the @entity115 , are looking at transforming co2 into useful chemical compounds called cyclic carbonates for industrial use			2
professor @entity112 says recycling @entity12 may be more vital for the chemical industries than for fuel production			1
" people do n't seem to realize that ten percent of everything that comes out of an oil well does n't go to the fuel industry , it drives the chemical industry			2
so not only are we facing a fuel crisis but the entire chemical industry is likely to cease to exist			0
so we desperately need to find ways of making basic chemical materials out of @entity12 to keep the chemical industries ticking over			0
professor @entity134 and his team are currently in discussions with some potential investors			0
he believes that @entity14 ' program sounds feasible			1
" they will need to address issues about how long the biocatalysts are active for before they need replacing			0
if they only work for a day then you are going to be getting through tons and tons of biocatalyst for each ton of @entity12			1
" @entity147 life span and poisoning -- by things like nitrous oxide , sulfur dioxide and other impurities - will be the issues determining how feasible it is and how cost effective it is , " he said			0
while @entity32 does n't envisage his biocatalytic technology being able to service the fuel needs of all motorists , he is confident that it can perform profitably on a smaller scale			1
" transportation uses transportable fuels			0
we need renewables -- wind , tidal -- but these are not useable in the transport sector			0
one of the challenges in the future will be transportation , " he said			0
" the grand vision here is to take waste , build it into a portable fuel and make it useful			0
" @entity32 recently presented his ideas to a climate conference at @entity178 in the @entity115 where they were warmly received			0
and if all goes to plan the company will start a pilot project in 2009			0
the conference also gave him the opportunity to promote another @entity14 venture : turning co2 into precipitated calcium carbonate			1
like professor @entity134 , his target is the industrial sector ; in particular the paper , plastics and pharmaceutical manufacturers			0
another potential benefit of recycling co2 will be the reduction of large scale geosequestration			1
the problem of rising co2 emissions was highlighted again recently with the publication of the @entity202 's @entity201 2007			0
concentrations of atmospheric @entity12 have risen to 383 parts per million			0
a rise of 2.2 ppm on 2006 figures			0
of 28 billion metric tons of co2 released into the atmosphere , fossil fuel emissions accounted for almost a third			1
although some climate critics might scoff at the idea of recycling co2 arguing that we should be emitting less rather than recycling a pollutant , reusing it may well prove effective in kick - starting a new carbon market , as well as helping clean up our increasingly polluted planet .			1

@entity9 company testing a *revolutionary* new method of recycling co2 into fuel
@entity14 using biocatalyst technology to transform co2 into fuel efficiently
technology could reduce the millions of tons of co2 emitted by the energy sector
