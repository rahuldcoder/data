-- is @entity1 currently the world 's best footballer ? he is certainly making a case for himself			1
a day after the @entity5 signed a new four - and - a - half year contract , @entity1 found the back of the net two more times -- in brilliant fashion -- as @entity10 beat @entity11 3 - 1 to leapfrog @entity12 at the top of the @entity14			1
" two brilliant goals , a genuine world - class player , " stated @entity10 manager @entity15 , to the club website			1
@entity1 might have had a hat - trick , too , had he shot on goal instead of setting up @entity22 on a two - man break saturday			1
@entity1 now has 19 league goals this season -- despite missing the first six matches of the campaign due to a ban			1
that 's more than @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31			0
his goals - per - game ratio in the league is also better than the high - profile trio , who ply their trade in @entity40 's @entity39			1
if @entity1 keeps up his impressive pace , he will smash the record for most goals in a @entity14 season			1
@entity1 , deputizing as captain for the still injured @entity46 , opened the scoring when he volleyed @entity49 's chipped pass past @entity50 in the 25th minute			2
he unselfishly assisted on @entity22 's tap in three minutes before the interval and made it 3 - 0 with a curled effort across goal in the 45th			1
@entity10 struck the bar twice in the first half , with @entity50 thwarting @entity22			2
@entity11 pulled a goal back through @entity60 's header in the 58th minute during a brief spell of superiority but @entity10 soon reasserted its control and @entity1 hit the outside of the post on a rebound			1
" we played very well in the first half and in the second half not as well , " @entity1 told @entity67			2
" but most important was that we won			0
" @entity10 leads @entity12 by a point , though the @entity71 can reclaim first spot monday against @entity73			2
@entity74 later went ahead of @entity12 on goal difference following a 4 - 2 win at @entity77 and defending champion @entity79 ended a two - game league losing streak at home by downing @entity83 3 - 1 in a battle of teams who this week progressed to the last four of the @entity87			1
@entity10 visits @entity74 -- a perfect 8 - 0 - 0 at home with 35 goals scored -- in @entity91 's standout clash			1
" we have been on a fantastic run , " said @entity15			0
" the quality of our football is at a really high level			0
we 're pressing the game very well , our aggression to get the ball back is good			0
" we 'll arrive there on @entity91 in a really good moment			0
it 's a game i 'm really looking forward to			0
" @entity74 has struggled away from home and looked like it might drop more points playing without injured striker @entity106 after seeing a 2 - 0 lead turn to 2 - 2			2
but late goals by substitutes @entity109 and @entity111 bailed out @entity11			2
@entity112 , another substitute , scored for the second consecutive game to add to first - half strikes for @entity115 and @entity116 at @entity117			1
@entity79 overtook idle @entity118 for seventh			0
newly promoted @entity11 stayed above the relegation zone but it may not be enough to prevent manager @entity122 from being dismissed by owner @entity123			0
@entity123 -- in attendance at @entity125 -- is reportedly dismayed by the amount of money @entity122 spent on players in the off - season and wanted the former @entity131 defender to resign			0
" i wo n't be walking away , " @entity122 told @entity67			0
" that 's the first thing			0
i 'm proud to be the manager of @entity11			0
" elsewhere , @entity134 blanked @entity135 3 - 0 to maintain its push for a @entity138 berth ; @entity139 overcame the disappointment of losing to @entity79 in the @entity87 quarterfinals by toppling @entity142 2 - 1 ; and @entity143 drew @entity144 1 - 1 in its first match since the sacking of @entity147			1
ten - man @entity148 , which upset @entity73 in the @entity87 , earned a point but stayed last after a 0 - 0 draw against @entity152 .			0

@entity1 scores two goals and sets up the other as @entity10 beats @entity11 3 - 1
@entity1 has 19 league goals this season despite missing six matches due to a ban
the @entity5 signed a new four - and - a - half year contract with the @entity163 on *friday*
