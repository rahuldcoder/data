@entity0 , @entity1 -- we found him on a sunday morning , as an outdoor service came to a close at what was once the @entity9 cathedral			1
when the hymns faded , we picked through the carcass of the building , and there he was among the collapsed walls , his slender body framed by piles of rubble and blue sky attempting to peek through after a hard rain			2
in his arms , he cradled a child , not more than a year old			2
her name , he said , is @entity24			2
she was born , he told us , on january 12 , 2010 , just hours before @entity1 's massive earthquake			1
his story was stunning , even in a place where everyone has a tale of survival			2
we immediately thought of it as symbolic of @entity1 's struggle this past year -- to go on living despite extreme hardship			1
but it would not take long for doubt to creep in			2
it 's difficult to believe people in the new world that is @entity0 , where desperation prompts people to say anything if they think that it will bring them attention , and maybe help			1
not that trust was ever in abundance here during decades of dictators and despots			2
but now people have very little documentation left of their lives , and journalists have little choice but to place some faith in what the subjects of their stories tell them			1
many people we interviewed wanted payment , simply for answering our questions			1
it was not an agreement we could make			2
but we could understand the request , coming as it did in a place where meals are not routine , where grinding poverty has changed the rules of life			2
the grim anniversary of the earthquake has long passed			1
this week , the spotlight fell on @entity1 for a different reason -- @entity77 was declared the winner of a troubled presidential election			1
but for the most part , international journalists , like us , have packed their bags and gone elsewhere			1
some are in @entity85 , covering that nation 's earthquake tragedy			1
but the story of the man in the rubble of the cathedral still haunts			1
it is worth telling because it does epitomize something about @entity1 : a new wave of misery in which truth , and deception , are both tools for survival			1
a tale of desperation , resilience this much is known to be true : the man asked nothing of me or my @entity2 colleague @entity108 when we happened upon him			1
only when we remarked on his situation did he say he wished he had a tent to shield his baby from the rain and milk to fill her aching belly			2
and this is the story he told			1
@entity24 was born on january 12 , at 9 a.m. , almost eight hours before the ground shook for 35 seconds and dismantled much of @entity0			1
his wife of five years , @entity118 , gave birth in a small shelter they called home in the shadows of the cathedral			2
in all his 23 years , he has known nothing but poverty of the most extreme kind			0
when he was 3 , his mother brought him with her from @entity129 to beg in the big city			0
he grew to manhood while living on the streets of @entity0			0
he had hoped for a different life for his own 3 - year - old son , @entity134 , and now , @entity24			0
@entity135 returns to help in ongoing recovery then the @entity137 came tumbling down			0
dust billowed everywhere as enormous chunks of plaster and concrete roared like an avalanche , flattening everything in its path			0
instantly , @entity118 was crushed to death			0
she was buried with about 30 others behind the cathedral			0
the man 's friend , @entity148 , was cooking rice and beans on a small wooden stove			1
it toppled over and the hot water scalded @entity24			0
the father scooped her up and ran with her to the general hospital			0
as he talked , he showed us the scars on the baby 's right leg			1
these days , he enters the broken cathedral to shelter his baby from the searing sun , to seek refuge in the very building that wrought death in his family			0
sometimes , he peddles for change from the foreigners who visit			0
he depends on the charity of others , he said			0
he began believing that everything that befell him was @entity176 's will			1
when he finds food , he said , he feels guilty that he gives most of it to his infant daughter			1
his son goes without -- for two , maybe three days			0
" i do n't even know how to take care of her , " he said			0
" i bathe her but i do n't know how to braid her hair			0
" single fatherhood is hard anywhere			0
imagine the enormity of the task for a poor man in post-earthquake @entity1			1
he wiped tears away with his dust - caked hands			0
it was difficult not to be moved by his story			0
we photographed him , interviewed him further			1
but when we returned two days later , we were led to see him in a different light			0
others cast doubt on his story			0
" he is not telling you the truth , " two men told us , indirectly , through our interpreter			1
" he has a wife			0
" if that was his ultimate goal , he put up an elaborate ruse , hoping we would find him amid the rubble and pity him			0
and he 'd never asked us for money			0
we made our way through the tents and plastic tarpaulins on the street near the cathedral , asking others who lived there about him			0
a blind man known for his guitar riffs and his willingness to talk to foreigners told us the story was true			1
so did @entity148 , the friend who was cooking that day and said she saw the quake throw water on the baby			0
@entity108 and @entity231 believed the man 's story			1
the @entity236 's @entity235 photographed @entity24 and her father four months ago for the anniversary of the earthquake			1
" i can only go by what he told me			1
i believe him , " @entity235 told me			2
" if someone is lying to you , you would sense it			0
no one told me he is lying			2
" so why would some try to discredit him ? the man insisted he had not embellished his story			2
he said others accused him of lying because they were jealous			0
" they all hate me because most often people who come to the cathedral give me money or food so that i can take care of the baby			2
" it is a sad fact that there is so much competition for attention in @entity1			1
that one man 's need can be seen as another 's threat			1
in an odd way , it matters little whether the man 's story is true			1
the fact of his existence is real , as are the dire circumstances in which he lives			2
he is not just a metaphor for @entity1			1
and i feel certain that if we return to the small city of tents and tarps that hug the cast - iron gates of the cathedral , we will find him there			0
he says his name is @entity284			0
i believe this to be true .			0

many people we interviewed wanted payment , simply for answering our questions
people have little documentation left of their lives , and journalists have to have faith in subjects
the man told us his daughter was born just hours before @entity1 's massive earthquake
