@entity0 , @entity1 -- nine - year - old @entity3 was ambitious , and she liked to be in charge			1
she was the only girl on her @entity6 baseball team in @entity0 , @entity1 -- and she told others she wanted to be the first woman to play in the major leagues			1
most believed she could do it , someday			2
but her life was cut short by a gunman 's bullet saturday as she attended a congresswoman 's meet - and - greet in a supermarket parking lot			1
@entity3 's family , friends , classmates , and hundreds of mourners filled @entity20 in @entity0 for a funeral service thursday afternoon , all of them passing under a giant @entity24 flag that was recovered in the aftermath of the terror attacks in @entity27 on september 11 , 2001 -- the day @entity3 was born			1
dozens of mourners paid their respects by standing outside the church , which was was filled to capacity			2
representatives from professional baseball also were in attendance			2

before the tearful crowd , he spoke directly to his departed daughter : " @entity45 , " he began , " i ca n't tell you how much we all miss you			1
" " i think you have affected the whole country , " he said			2
@entity3 was " a little girl with the wisdom of a wise woman , " bishop @entity49 said			1

" " @entity73 , my @entity74 , time to close your eyes , " the song began			0
the young girl had recently been elected to the student council at @entity79 , and a neighbor -- impressed with @entity3 's civic interest -- took her to the event to meet rep. @entity83			1

the shooting set off a political firestorm across the country , with pundits charging that extreme partisan politics somehow played a role in the mass killing			1
the president noted that @entity3 was just beginning to discover the political system -- something that she saw " through the eyes of a child , undimmed by the cynicism or vitriol that we adults all too often just take for granted			1
" i want us to live up to her expectations			0
i want our democracy to be as good as @entity3 imagined it			1

we 're just taking it slow			0
we 're hanging in there , we 're trying to be strong			0
we have to be strong			0
our country 's being strong , our community is being strong for us , so we will , you know , get through this with our faith and our friends and our family , " mother @entity145 told @entity2 's @entity146 wednesday night , before the public memorial service			0
most of the mourners arriving for @entity3 's funeral service thursday paused to look up at the huge flag that rippled between the extended ladders of two fire trucks outside the church			1
the banner , which has been patched with flags recovered from other disasters , was sent by the @entity27 @entity162			0
the gesture is precious to the @entity36 family			0
" we both let out a gasp of emotion , because , you know , that meant a lot to us , " @entity3 's father told @entity2			1
" and for them to extend that courtesy to our daughter ... again , it 's just another one of those things that will help for us			2
we feel like the country wo n't forget her			0
" @entity3 was to be buried in a custom - made red oak casket donated by a group of @entity183 monks in @entity184			1
the lid of the casket was inscribed with her name , date of birth and death , and a cross			2
the family also will receive five small keepsake crosses hewn from the same wood as the casket , according to @entity194 , the general manager of @entity195			2

" and she 'd pay those blessings back by participating in a charity that helped children who were less fortunate			0
