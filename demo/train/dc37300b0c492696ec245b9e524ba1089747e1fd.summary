-- the emmys will be sunday night at the @entity2 in @entity3 , and @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 have nabbed a huge chunk of the major nods this year			1
this yet again sparks the question that has been looming around the industry for years : is the quality of programming from the major broadcast networks on the decline ? numbers do n't lie when the nominations for the @entity18 were announced , @entity5 received 104 , the most of any network for the 11th year in a row			1
with multiple opportunities to win for " @entity25 " ( 21 ) , " @entity26 " ( 18 ) , " @entity27 " ( 13 ) and the miniseries " @entity28 " ( 11 ) , the cable network ( which is owned by @entity0 's parent company ) is poised to show up strong at this year 's awards			1
however , to be fair , major network comedies also received multiple nominations , including @entity34 's " @entity33 " ( 17 ) ; @entity36 's " @entity35 " ( 16 ) and " @entity37 " ( 13 ) ; and @entity39 's " @entity38 " ( 12 )			1
still , it 's hard not to notice the lack of major network dramas in that list			1
for some perspective , here is a breakdown of the most nominated networks for the 2011 @entity48 : @entity5 : 104 @entity49 : 50 @entity36 : 46 @entity50 : 43 @entity39 : 42 @entity34 : 40 @entity4 : 29 @entity6 : 21 @entity51 : 11 @entity52 : 10 major network nominations total 188 , while cable television nominations earned a grand total of 271			1
so , one ca n't help but wonder : what is cable doing that major networks are n't , in terms of drama ? no more drama ? " @entity66 " creator and executive producer @entity64 has his own theory			1
he told the @entity68 : " cable has found a way to tap into a lot of frustrated creativity and exploit it financially			0
i can literally look at these shows on basic cable and pick where they would have been 10 years ago on network tv ; some would not have been on at all			1
" also , for the most part , cable series have shorter seasons than those on major networks			2
they usually run 10 to 13 episodes , as opposed to network television 's 23 episodes a season			2
shorter seasons tend to mean tighter storytelling and less " filler " episodes			0
( " @entity93 , " we are looking at you			0
) a perfect example of this is @entity4 's dramatic series " @entity101 , " which based its entire short season on one murder			1
every episode of " @entity101 " had the viewer glued to the small screen , thanks to the show 's tight storytelling , outstanding acting and production qualities			0
it is much easier to keep a narrative interesting over 13 shows ( without having to include unnecessary storyline filler ) as opposed to a typical network season of 22 shows			2
while a longer season is perfect for procedural dramas like " csi , " " @entity119 " and " @entity120 : @entity125 , " shows that rely heavily on episodic storytelling have huge advantages with a shorter season			2
another thing cable networks are doing extremely well is delivering shows with outstanding production values			0
shows featured on @entity5 and @entity4 often have lavish , visually striking sets that could easily be the backdrop of a major motion picture			1
last but not least , cable networks are blessed with the freedom to program to a niche audience			0
network programming has been forced to cast a wider net , playing to the lowest common denominator			2
for instance , @entity34 's forthcoming remake of " @entity142 " is a show that viewers would probably never see on an @entity4 network because of the pure fluff factor			1
typically , cable networks tend to focus on producing intelligent shows that do n't necessarily rely on gimmicks like the expected jiggle factor on a show like " @entity142			0
" " @entity154 " is good drama however , one quality drama on network tv does stand out among the crowd			2
@entity49 's " @entity154 " starring @entity160 is arguably the best drama on network television right now			0
the combination of a stellar cast , high - quality writing and a compelling long - term story arc is superior to any other drama airing on the big four networks			0
the show 's writers clearly value the intelligence of the show 's viewers , and the actors are more than up to the task			0
other networks need to look to " @entity154 " and start taking more risks			0
one may argue that there is something for everyone on television these days			0
however , i 'd like to see more shows in the vein of @entity5 's " @entity26 " gracing the television landscape , as opposed to more reboots like @entity49 's " @entity186 " and shows like the @entity36 dramedy " @entity188			1
