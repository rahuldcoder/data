the @entity8 lawyers are using @entity109 's @entity7 and " @entity67 " reference to argue that " @entity3 knew @entity8 had suffered chronic substance abuse and drug dependency problems for many years			1
" " shortly after he joined the ' dangerous ' tour in 1993 , dr. @entity114 was asked to treat @entity8 for pain , " the @entity8 filing said , referring to dr. @entity114 , a doctor on the 1993 tour			2

@entity2 wrote to his boss , @entity3 president @entity3 , that they should present gross ticket sales numbers to @entity8 , not the percentage of the net profits , during contract talks			1

we want to remind him what is expected of him			0
" @entity2 , in a video deposition played in court on the first day of the trial , said he could not remember writing the e-mail			0
e-mails become key " they put dr. @entity37 in a position where if he said @entity8 ca n't go or ca n't play , if he said i ca n't give you those drugs , then he does n't get paid , " @entity8 lawyer @entity49 told jurors in his opening statements			0
