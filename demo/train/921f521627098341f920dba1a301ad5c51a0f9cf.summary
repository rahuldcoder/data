@entity1 , @entity0 -- the @entity3 almost provided one of football 's biggest upsets when they were narrowly beaten by @entity7 in the final of the @entity9 in @entity10			1
the @entity3 players cut dejected figures after their @entity9 final defeat to @entity7 goals from @entity15 and captain @entity16 had given the @entity3 a 2 - 0 lead at half - time , before @entity19 struck twice after the break and @entity21 headed home the winner six minutes before the final whistle to give @entity7 the title			0
while the presence of the @entity3 in the final reflects the significant progress made since the country hosted the @entity31 in 1994 , it will undoubtedly raise expectation levels for the @entity33			1
@entity35 to this is whether the current crop of players in coach @entity39 's squad possess the credentials to make the next step and become serious challengers to the @entity44 and @entity45 elite			0
@entity47 columnist and @entity49 expert @entity46 felt that while the exploits of the national team were impressive , the country is still some way short of fulfilling their potential on the world stage			1
" the way the tournament went it really opened up for the @entity3 and certainly the progress made is there for all to see , particularly in the victory over @entity59 who had been on an good run up until that point , " @entity46 told @entity2			1
" undoubtedly things have moved on a great deal since the @entity31 was staged here in 1994 , but if you look at the bigger picture there is perhaps a slight sense of underachievement because of the huge resources available			1
" in terms of organization , facilities and sheer participation numbers the @entity3 has massive potential which has not quite yet been matched by what has happened at national level			0
" does the @entity80 community hold the key for the future of @entity3 football ? sound off here			2
crucially @entity46 believes that for the @entity3 to shake the tag of nearly men there must be a stronger emphasis placed on tapping into the abundance of talent provided within the country 's @entity80 population			1
" the experience that players have gained from playing in @entity94 has improved the players and @entity39 has molded a side which can hold it 's own against some of the bigger nations , " @entity46 explained			0
" but for the @entity3 to become a real force then it must begin to tap into the quality of talent available in the @entity80 community which can be nurtured to take the game to the next level			1
" the @entity105 has yet to really embrace this idea and i think that needs to change in the first instance to enable the development of players capable of winning matches at the very top			0
" @entity115 side @entity114 is a case in point			0
something like 50 percent of their support is @entity80 , 90 percent of their youth talent is @entity80 but have only have a few @entity80 players in the team			2
" and that extends to the national team			2
the composition of the side at the moment is very much the team that @entity39 and @entity130 built and they -- like a number of @entity115 coaches -- have gone for players they can trust and rely on			0
" the @entity80 players have the game in their blood and their skill and technical levels need to be embraced rather than maybe having a dependence on players who fit a specific system			0
" for @entity46 , at least , it seems that development of the @entity80 talent must therefore become a keystone policy for the @entity49 to put them into the bracket of serious @entity31 contenders in years to come			1
but what of their chances at next year 's @entity31 in @entity10 ? he added : " the @entity3 should not get carried way with their performance at the @entity9 and the players should not look beyond getting past the group stages in @entity10			1
" a good run in @entity160 and @entity161 in 2002 was followed by elimination before the knockout phase in @entity164 2006 so they need to be cautious			0
" winning the @entity31 will probably be beyond the @entity3 next year			2
@entity39 will make them a difficult team to beat , and i do n't think anyone will get an easy game against them so it will be interesting to see how they do			0

@entity3 national team have made progress since hosting the @entity31 in 1994
resources to develop the game in the @entity3 are among the world 's best
expert @entity46 believes the country needs to tap into @entity80 talent
