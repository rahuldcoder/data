-- @entity1 and @entity2 decided to build a tiny home for their family in @entity7 's @entity6 to free themselves of the financial burden of owning a large home			0
they knew that moving two children , a dog and a cat into a 168 - square foot space would be a challenge , though it would also eliminate the need for a mortgage and cut their utility costs			1
but they did n't expect it to completely change their lives , @entity21 said			0
the savings allowed the 39 - year - old mother to scale back her hours working for a nonprofit and spend more time on the family 's 3 - acre hillside property in @entity31 , @entity7 , she said			2
she now has more time to pursue her passion for writing , gardening , raising chickens and , most importantly , to enjoy her kids			0
her husband , a chef , was able to leave a stressful restaurant and take a pay cut to work in a more creative environment			0
@entity42 share stories of living in small spaces the perks go beyond saving money or having a smaller environmental footprint , though both are huge benefits , @entity21 said			1
there 's also the intangible delight derived from cooking in a kitchen where everything is within arms ' reach , or eating off the beautiful china set that was locked in a cabinet when they lived in a 1,500 - square foot home , she said			2
" living mortgage - free has given us the freedom to make decisions based on what will make us happy , not what we have to do to pay the mortgage , " @entity2 said in a @entity60			1
" the things we have are beautiful , enriching our tiny space			0
we got rid of so much and kept the beautiful things , " she said			0
" freeing ourselves from consumer debt and living mortgage - free has cleared the clutter to help us see what is truly important : our relationships , our happiness , each moment			1
" the @entity75 are part of a small contingent of homeowners who have found solace living in less than 500 square feet			1
many of them live in homes built on trailers so they can move around ; others , like the @entity75 , live on property they own			2
others live in @entity87 homes built of clay and mica			2
some are motivated by a desire to lessen their carbon footprint while others want to own a home without worrying about property taxes			0
small homes are n't for everybody , but those who embrace the lifestyle tend to become their most enthusiastic boosters			1
most of the @entity42 who shared their stories of living small with @entity0 also build tiny homes or run businesses dedicated to helping others build their own			1
the small home movement has been around for years in small cities and rural areas , but this summer , it made a big incursion into one of the country 's largest and most densely populated urban centers			1
@entity113 mayor @entity112 in july announced a pilot program to develop a new housing model for the city 's growing small - household population			1
the program , @entity119 , seeks to accommodate the need for smaller apartments for roughly 1.8 million households in @entity113 that consist of one or two people			1
the @entity124 kicked off the program in july with a request for proposals from designers and development teams for self - contained " micro-units " between 275 and 300 square feet , including kitchen and bathroom			1
the contest closed last week , drawing 33 submissions mostly from teams in the @entity136 , along with international entries from @entity138 and @entity139			0
the proposals suggest the use of modular design and some include sustainable design such as solar paneling , the housing department said thursday			2
the winning proposal will form the basis for a mixed - income rental building in the @entity151 neighborhood of @entity152 consisting of micro-units			2
the winning applicant will be responsible for designing , constructing , owning and managing the property as part of the housing department 's model for developing city - owned property			2
the housing department said it hopes to announce a winner in 2013 and break ground by year 's end			0
of course , many @entity113 already live in micro-sized units or smaller			1
for @entity171 @entity170 , living in her 214 - square foot @entity167 studio is a rite of passage for living in @entity113			1
but after 13 years in the same small apartment , she 's ready for an upgrade and a bathtub			2
most of the city 's small apartments are in old buildings and there are n't enough of them			1
@entity113 has 1.8 million one - and two - person households , but only 1 million studios or one - bedrooms , the housing department said			1
the city wants to build more that " have substantial access to light and air to create a sense of openness , " the housing department said			1
clearly , renting a micro-unit in @entity113 and building your own home in the country are two different animals			1
but there is some overlap between micro-units and tiny homes and the people who live in them			1
building codes and ordinances complicate matters and can prevent residents from living in the units full - time			2
@entity113 's housing codes currently do not allow an entire building of micro-units , a housing department spokesman said			1
under the pilot program , @entity212 will waive certain zoning regulations at a city - owned site to test the market for this new housing model			1
in @entity221 , @entity222 , ireporter @entity219 was surprised to learn that while there are no limits on how big you build a home , the same is n't true for building small			1
to get around @entity229 regulations requiring a permit to build their 160 - square - foot home with plumbing , the @entity227 built their home on a trailer bed , subject to different regulations as a recreational vehicle			2
the @entity227 stayed there while working on a bigger home on their property , which is nearly done , she said			0
at 700 square feet , it seems like a mansion			1
but they enjoyed their time in the smaller dwelling for a variety of reasons			0
" a small space is easy to clean , heat and there 's a wonderful coziness about it			2
you are all tucked in with the things you need and use the most and that 's appealing psychologically , " @entity219 said in an @entity60			0
" it 's a fantastically liberating experience to live in a small space that is also hugely fun and entertaining , not just for you as the builder and occupant , but for others who pass by and just want to peek inside			0
and whether you stay in a tiny house permanently or end up building , you 've got a perfect guest cottage that you can share with friends , family , sell or rent out			0
" while the amount of savings can differ greatly for a renter of a micro-unit versus a small - home owner , cost - effectiveness is definitely part of the equation in both models			1
the average rent for a regular studio apartment in @entity151 is roughly $ 2,000 , according to the housing department			0
the department hopes to see proposals with rents well below that , though it has not set price or rental rate criteria as part of the competition			0
ireporter @entity286 and @entity288 rent the land on which they keep their 204 - square - foot home , which they designed and built mostly from off - the - shelf building materials			0
the design allows for passive solar heating in the winter , has a metal roof for rainwater collection and uses an incinerating toilet to minimize water usage and avoid the need for sewage disposal , said @entity286 , an architectural designer			0
in total , their monthly expenses are around $ 300 and they own the home outright without having incurred any debt , she said in an @entity60			0
many of the advantages of living in a small space were planned and expected , she said			1
but the couple is also enjoying unexpected advantages , like a connection to their community			0
" when humans can do everything in the sheltered enclaves of our homes , we rarely venture out ; we become isolated			0
our small home encourages us to go outside and talk to the neighbors , go on hikes and meet people , go to coffee shops and restaurants , the library , the gym etc. , etc. the list goes on , " @entity286 said in an @entity60			0
downsizing has also produced benefits , she said			0
" i have been inspired to finally be tidy and clean ; always putting everything away in its designed location			0
this creates a sense of spaciousness and sanity i 've never had before in a home , " she said			0
