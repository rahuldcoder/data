-- since the @entity2 were launched in 2000 , the world has made tremendous gains in reducing new hiv infections and helping people with @entity6 to live longer and healthier lives			1
for a long time , efforts to ensure that a pregnant woman living with @entity6 would not pass the virus to her child -- during pregnancy , at childbirth , or during breastfeeding -- have lagged behind the promise of technology			0
but now we can say confidently that with the right efforts , we can reduce new hiv infections among children to zero , even within the short time remaining until the @entity2 are concluded at the end of 2015			1
during the upcoming meeting of leaders at the @entity29 , the world 's governments , ngos and the private sector should take an important step toward reaching the goal of zero new hiv infections among children			1
this can be achieved by deploying a new generation of community health workers ( @entity37 ) who will not only help to fight @entity39 but also bring other kinds of health care to the communities they are serving			1
@entity44 , @entity46 's @entity45 , many businesses and @entity25 have joined forces with @entity50 governments in the 1 million @entity51 to deploy this large number of @entity37 across @entity50 by the end of 2015			1
although we 've known for more than a decade that transmission of @entity6 from a pregnant woman to her child can be stopped through appropriate interventions -- including timely access to antiretroviral medicines -- the practical challenges to eliminating new infections are substantial			0
most women in low - income countries give birth at home , without medical assistance , and usually without the benefit of prenatal care			0
one key to overcoming these challenges is to ensure that trained health care professionals are on hand to provide prenatal and delivery support , even in the poorest villages			0
the @entity75 and @entity44 are doing just that by building a network of health workers , supported with training , new technology , a supply chain of antiretrovirals and other key inputs , and professional supervision at the level of clinics and hospitals			1
today , teams of trained health workers across the @entity89 complement the nurses and midwives in a structured health care system that is providing pregnant women with not only services to prevent @entity6 transmission , but comprehensive services including prenatal care , counseling for hiv - positive women , access to antiretrovirals and professional follow - up care for newborns			1
the telecoms industry is also playing a new and historic role			0
in the @entity107 system , the health workers are equipped with smartphones			1
with better technology , community health workers are now accessing real - time emergency guidance , making calls for ambulances in emergencies , maintaining digital health records for each household and more			2
with community - based care , the @entity37 are able to expand services to reach more women and newborns			0
for example , in the @entity75 of @entity121 in @entity122 , nearly all pregnant women are receiving @entity6 counseling and testing , compared with fewer than half in 2008			0
children who do become infected with @entity6 are diagnosed earlier and given timely access to @entity6 treatment , care and support			0
the community health workers are also playing a growing role in identifying bottlenecks and implementing solutions by engaging decision makers from local to national levels			2
challenges such as low acceptance of @entity6 counseling and testing , commodity stock - outs and infant feeding issues are being identified and addressed with local responses			0
next week as heads of state and global leaders gather at the @entity146 , @entity44 , the @entity75 and partners in the telecoms industry and beyond will seize the opportunity to make a push for zero new hiv infections among children , and for the 1 million @entity37 in @entity50 who can help make the goal a reality			1
on september 28 , we will also join 60,000 people on the @entity158 of @entity160 's @entity159 for @entity161 -- along with many millions more watching from around the world -- to issue a global appeal for these historic objectives			2
we believe that the world will rise to the occasion			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity169 and @entity170 .			2
