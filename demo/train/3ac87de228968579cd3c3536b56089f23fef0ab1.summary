-- i met @entity2 last year when she had just arrived in @entity3 from her hometown of @entity5 with her 10 - month - old baby			1
i was surprised to learn why she left the predominantly @entity9 state known for its clean , healthy lifestyle to move to a city known for life 's excesses			2
the young mother said she was trying to escape from what she called " an epidemic			0
" she said that @entity18 " was drowning in prescription pill addiction			1
" @entity2 divulged that she had actually been abusing heroin for some time , but -- as with most people with addiction problems in @entity18 -- it all started with pills			1
out of all 50 states , @entity18 ranks eighth in the number of prescription drugs overdose deaths , according to @entity28 with the state 's @entity29 and @entity31			1
and , despite a dip in 2008 , the number of pill - related deaths in @entity18 over the past decade has increased by 400 % , according to @entity35			1
i have always thought @entity18 had low levels of addiction because of the influence of its large @entity9 population -- more than 60 % of those living there are members of the @entity43			2
i 've even known @entity9 there who do n't drink coffee in deference to their religion 's " @entity48 , " a health law that strongly discourages people from consuming things that are harmful to their bodies			0
you 'd have to be hiding under a rock to not know how highly addictive prescription pills can be			0
and people in @entity18 , who have statistically speaking been successful at maintaining healthier lives , are no less vulnerable			2
in fact , because medications are prescribed by a physician , the assumption often is that they 're ok			0
many people who 've been able to maintain diligence in upholding the @entity43 @entity48 have fallen victim to pill addiction because of the gray area that doctor - prescribed pills inhabit			2
while the mormon church hierarchy certainly is n't proud of the exploding numbers , it did n't hide from the issue , giving us access to talk to those dealing with the struggles of addiction			1
earlier this year , we spent 12 days in @entity18 with church leaders and people in recovery as well as people deep in the throes of addiction			1
i met people who wore their hearts on their sleeves who shared some of their most painful moments			0
they allowed me into their worlds because they acknowledge pill addiction is a huge problem within their community and they know they need help			0
the people i spent time with are incredibly brave -- particularly @entity2 who i 'm happy to report has been clean for quite awhile now			0
i will always be grateful for their courage in sharing their stories .			0
