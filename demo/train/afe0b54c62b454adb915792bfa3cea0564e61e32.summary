-- @entity3 gov. @entity2 's stunning decision to sign a right - to - work law poses the question : are these anti-union statutes , which make illegal any union contract that requires union membership or payment of dues a condition of employment , the future ? during the last two years @entity14 and @entity15 have also passed laws that curb union strength and slash dues income			1
" if @entity3 can do it , then i think everybody ought to think about it , " asserts @entity19 , president of the @entity20			1
@entity19 listed @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 , where @entity28 enjoy large majorities in state legislatures , among the top contenders			0
the potential spread of right - to - work laws in the @entity34 , even in states where voters heavily favored president @entity37 for a second term , is a startling and ominous development			1
for decades , right - to - work laws were confined to the @entity41 or @entity42 , heavily agricultural states where new unions born during the depression era evoked , among many employers and conservative politicians , the specter of @entity49 , race - mixing or both			1
these laws were almost all enacted in the years after the 1947 @entity53 passage of the @entity54 , which gave states the right to make illegal any collective bargaining contract that mandated union membership as a condition of employment			1
opponents of unionism hailed these laws as insuring a " right - to - work " because they encouraged workers to take a job , even one where the wages and working conditions had been negotiated by a union , without paying the dues necessary to sustain the labor organization			1
to note that employers encouraged such free - loading would be an understatement			0
then and now they denounced " compulsory unionism " and the " labor bosses " who sought to live high on the hog on member dues			0
in this imagining , it was the union , not the employer , who oppressed the workers			1
opinion : a victory for right - to - work laws in 1958 , right - to - work advocates thought the time was ripe to invade the @entity34			1
a sharp recession in the late 1950s had sapped union strength at the same moment that the @entity95 's @entity94 investigation had uncovered unsavory links between @entity97 , the @entity98 , and organized crime			0
urged on by conservative @entity101 sen. @entity101 and financed by a newly created @entity102 , these anti-union activists put right to work referenda on the ballots of @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110			0
but with the exception of @entity108 , all these initiatives went down in overwhelming defeat			0
that was not only because labor was still a powerful force -- in @entity106 union density , the proportion of all workers in a union , stood at nearly 40 % -- but also because the @entity121 linked their fortunes to the labor movement and to the fight against right to work			2
as @entity126 , the @entity105 gubernatorial candidate put it , right to work represented " a return to the ugly and destructive law of the economic jungle			0
" the battle for the votes of african - americans constituted one of the most remarkable features of these referenda			0
right - to - work advocates pointed out , often quite accurately , that many @entity140 trade unions failed to adequately represent their minority members			1
if unions were weaker , minority workers might well get better jobs and promotions			0
but in @entity106 and @entity105 especially that argument failed to persuade			0
the @entity147 distributed a pamphlet entitled " keep @entity149 out of @entity105 , " but even without this kind of propaganda most african - americans and @entity153 knew that an imperfect union was a better friend that a non-union employer whose power and prejudices ruled the workplace unchecked by any countervailing institution			2
today , right - to - work forces are once again making a push to eviscerate unionism in its heartland			1
thanks to @entity165 they have unlimited money			0
thanks to globalization , slow growth , and corporate attacks , trade unionism is far weaker than in 1958			1
in @entity173 density stands at 13.4 % , in @entity27 14.6 % , in @entity3 , birth state of the once powerful @entity175 , just 17.5 % , a disastrous drop since the industrial union heyday in the 1950s			2
to staunch this anti-union assault , the @entity121 have to make the defense of union rights and power a central , organic component of their message to @entity140 voters , office holders and workers -- both white collar and blue			2
although @entity121 legislators in @entity15 , @entity3 and @entity106 have bravely fought the @entity28 right on this issue , president @entity37 has been notably missing from the action			1
@entity37 denounced " right to work for less " in a post-election speech at a factory outside @entity193 , but he was almost entirely silent on the issue both during the demonstrations that convulsed @entity196 , @entity15 , in the winter of 2011 , during the effort to recall @entity15 gov. @entity199 in the spring of the next year , and throughout the presidential campaign itself			2
@entity37 and his advisers undoubtedly thought that if they wanted to win right - to - work states like @entity204 and @entity205 , they better keep quite about union rights in the @entity34			1
but this was and is an exceedingly shortsighted and self defeating calculation			0
trade unions stand at the core of the @entity121 coalition			0
they are the last organizations remaining on the liberal side that can effectively appeal to white , working - class men in the @entity217 swing states			2
without the union organization and mobilization of blue collar @entity153 in @entity105 , @entity222 , and @entity223 those states would be almost as red as @entity224			2
when @entity37 declared his support for gay marriage , he helped consolidate a growing national consensus in favor of that right			0
the president and other national democrats need to use the same bully pulpit to defend trade unionism in its hour of need , not only because their destruction threatens the living standards of our working middle class , but because these institutions are the living embodiment of democracy , interracial solidarity and personal dignity in the world of work			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity251 .			0

@entity251 : will more states pass right - to - work laws like @entity3 ?
@entity251 : the potential spread of the laws in the @entity34 is startling and ominous
he says opponents try to paint the union , not the employer , as oppressors of workers
@entity251 : president @entity37 need to defend trade unionism in its hour of need
