@entity0 , @entity1 -- the wife of @entity1 's president has sued a @entity1 newspaper for $ 15 million following its publication of allegations that she was linked to and profited from illegal diamond sales in the southern @entity12 country			1
according to papers filed at the @entity14 in @entity0 wednesday , @entity15 , the wife of president @entity16 , is suing @entity17 for defamation after its report based on diplomatic cables released by the website @entity21			1
the cables in question , from the @entity25 in @entity0 , claimed that @entity1 's first lady was among the senior @entity28 and government officials who were gaining huge profits from the smuggling of diamonds in the eastern part of @entity1			2
" the diamonds that are sold to regime members and elites are sold for freshly printed @entity1 notes issued by the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) , " the paper quoted a 2008 cable as saying			2
" the cables suggested that ( the head of the bank , @entity41 ) @entity40 kept the money printing press running to finance the purchase of diamonds and this could have accelerated hyperinflation , which eventually rendered the @entity1 dollar worthless , " the newspaper charged			1
@entity15 said in the suit that the report published sunday by @entity17 was " false , scandalous , malicious and bent on damaging ( her ) reputation			1
" the documents said the newspaper wrongly suggested that @entity15 had " used her position as the @entity56 to access diamonds clandestinely , enriching herself in circumstances in which the country was facing serious foreign currency shortages , which amounts should have been channeled to the fiscus			1
" the imputation of such conduct on a person of such high standing , the mother of the nation , is to lower the respect with which she is held by all right thinking persons , to a point of disappearance , " the lawsuit said			0
@entity75 , an attorney for the newspaper , said the summons is being studied " and in due course we shall respond			0
" but looking at most of the claims , so far , i can say they are just meant to harass the press , " he said			0
@entity82 , a spokesman for the @entity83 of journalists , said the group was " concerned " about the lawsuit			2
" we condemn suing newspapers for merely reproducing something which is in the public domain			0
it is one way of trying to frustrate access to information , and to squeeze newspapers out of existence			0
as a union , we are really concerned that a crackdown on journalists may resurface , " he said .			0

the cables say @entity15 and others profited from illegal diamond sales
the @entity17 said the sales accelerated hyperinflation in the country
