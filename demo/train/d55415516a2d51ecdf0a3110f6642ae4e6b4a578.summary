@entity0 , @entity1 -- the trial for seven people accused of manslaughter in connection to an earthquake that killed more than 300 people in the @entity1 city of @entity10 was pushed back saturday to mid-october			1
the seven -- six scientists from the @entity12 ( @entity13 ) and a member of the @entity15 -- were members of a governmental panel that prosecutors accuse of giving a " rough , generic and ineffective assessment of the seismic risk " before the earthquake struck in april 2009			1
the seven , members of a so - called " major risks " panel , published " inaccurate , incomplete and contradictory information about the dangers of seismic activity undermining the protection of the population , " prosecutors have said			1
the attorney for defendant @entity31 , then - president of the @entity13 in @entity32 , told @entity2 saturday that the defense had asked for a postponement of 20 days to study new documents and videos submitted by the prosecution			0
the court 's next hearing was scheduled for october 15			0
only two defendants , @entity41 , then vice-director of the @entity15 , and @entity43 , head of the seismic office at the agency , appeared in court saturday			0
professor @entity47 , current president of the @entity13 , told @entity2 the trial was not about science but about the way information was communicated			1
" since people have died , it 's necessary to give an answer to the question , ' could some of the deaths have been avoided ? ' " he said			2
" the trial is basically on that , on the number of weak points in the communication chain			2
" he said parallels could be drawn between what happened in @entity10 and elsewhere in the world , such as @entity64			0
" we all have to work on new , and more clear , protocols , on the transfer of information , " he said			2
his colleagues on trial were " among the best scientists in the world , " he added , but had taken on an extra responsibility by their presence on the major risks commission			1
the city of @entity10 has requested 50 million euros ( $ 68 million ) in compensation over the quake			2
the @entity15 had organized a meeting of the major risks panel in @entity10 on march 31 , 2009 , amid concern among the city 's residents over ongoing seismic activity			1
after that meeting some members of the commission made reassuring statements to the press			0
six days later , the magnitude - 6.3 quake hit the city and surrounding areas , causing wide destruction and loss of life			0
the @entity96 ( @entity96 ) wrote to @entity1 's president @entity97 in june last year to express " concern " over the indictment of its @entity1 colleagues			1
the @entity102 ( @entity102 ) also published a statement last year in which it said the criminal charges brought against the seven accused were " unfounded			0
" " despite decades of scientific research in @entity1 and in the rest of the world , it is not yet possible to accurately and consistently predict the timing , location , and magnitude of earthquakes before they occur , " the @entity102 statement said			1
" it is thus incorrect to assume that the @entity10 earthquake should have been predicted			0
the charges may also harm international efforts to understand natural disasters and mitigate associated risk , because risk of litigation will discourage scientists and officials from advising their government or even working in the field of seismology and seismic risk assessment			2
" journalist @entity129 contributed to this report .			0

a senior @entity1 scientist says the trial is about how information was *relayed*
six scientists and a government official are charged over the 2009 quake
prosecutors say they gave *misleading* information about the risks
the tremor killed more than 300 people and caused huge damage
