-- when you get bored , your eyes wander			0
so when a blossoming blowout between the @entity7 and some other team in monday night 's college football championship floated into yawnfest territory , the electronic eyes of @entity5 naturally went wandering -- settling on a brunette bombshell who just happens to be the girlfriend of @entity15 quarterback @entity14			1
" now when you are a quarterback at @entity15 , you see that lovely lady there , she does go to @entity24 , i want to admit that , but she 's also @entity26 and that 's @entity14 's girlfriend , ok , " @entity5 broadcaster @entity16 said monday night as the camera focused on @entity18 in the stands			1
" wow , i 'm telling you , quarterbacks -- you get all the good - looking women			0
what a beautiful woman , " he gushed			1
" wow ! " @entity5 : @entity16 went too far as the chasm grew between @entity15 and the other team -- the name will surely come back to us soon -- @entity5 kept going back to the well , repeatedly showing @entity36 cheering in the crowd , wearing her boyfriend 's no. 10 jersey			1
finally , @entity41 columnist @entity40 jokingly tweeted , " sources : @entity14 's girlfriend to seek restraining order from @entity16 at halftime			1
" is @entity15 college football 's new dynasty ? the attention prompted thousands of football fans to check out of the game and check up on @entity14 's flame , turning " @entity18 " into @entity52 's second - hottest search -- behind only @entity14 himself			1
all the attention made her a hotter property on @entity56 , as well			2
she went from a scant 526 followers december 26 to more than 148,000 tuesday , according to the stats site @entity59 , outscoring her gridiron boyfriend 's 91,000 fans on the social networking service			0
in her first tweet after the game , @entity36 did n't mention what had happened			2
" so extremely blessed ... @ 10ajmccarron			0
congrats to @entity15 and making history ! # @entity70 " is all she said in that message , posted at 11:07 p.m. @entity16 's fawning attention prompted a spate of criticism of the 73 - year - old broadcaster , with some posters to @entity56 calling his comments " creepy			1
" the episode even spawned the creation of a parody @entity56 account , " @entity80			0
" @entity0 was not able to reach @entity16 for comment through @entity5 , but the network responded , saying : " we always try to capture interesting storylines and the relationship between an @entity24 grad who is miss @entity15 and the current @entity26 quarterback certainly met that test			1
however , we apologize that the commentary in this instance went too far and @entity16 understands that			0
" far from being creeped out , @entity36 said tuesday that she was " flattered " by the broadcaster 's comments , entertainment website @entity96 reported			1
" i 've been reading on @entity56 that @entity16 had backlash that he 's ' creepy ' , " @entity96 quoted @entity36 as saying			1
" if i were to see him i would say , ' i do n't think you 're creepy at all ! ' " one of @entity14 's teammates , center @entity101 , joked tuesday in an appearance on @entity0 's " @entity104 " that he was jealous of @entity36 's sudden fame			2
" where 's the love for the actual players ? " he joked			0
" she is certainly very pretty			0
but i just think @entity16 needs to share the love a little bit , that 's all i 'm saying			2
" @entity36 is the second rather attractive member of a football audience that @entity16 and network cameras have helped push into the limelight			1
back in 2005 , when @entity117 cameras panned across a trio of scantily clad football fans during a @entity121 football game , @entity16 opined that " 1,500 red - blooded @entity122 just decided to apply " to the school			2
one of those fans , @entity125 , went on to a 15 - minutes - of - fame career with appearances in @entity128 and @entity129 and a job as the stadium host for @entity133 football games			0
later , quarterback @entity134 got in trouble for sending her lurid messages while he was a player on the @entity133			0
for the record , @entity36 was @entity139 2012 and is a 2011 graduate of @entity24 with a degree in business management and administration , according to her @entity145 biography			0
oh , by the way , almost forgot ... it was @entity148 on the business end of that 42 - 14 drubbing @entity15 put on .			0
