@entity0 -- on his final full day in office , president @entity2 issued commutations for two former @entity7 @entity6 agents convicted in 2006 of shooting and wounding an unarmed illegal immigrant -- suspected of drug smuggling at the time -- and then covering it up			1
an artist 's sketch shows @entity14 , left , and @entity15			1
the prison sentences of @entity14 and @entity15 will now end march 20			1
@entity14 had received an 11 - year prison sentence ; @entity15 had received a 12 - year term			1
they began serving their sentences in january 2007			2
the @entity23 was still reviewing the clemency request when @entity2 made his decision , @entity22 spokeswoman @entity21 said			1
" the president has reviewed the circumstances of this case as a whole and the conditions of confinement and believes the sentences they received are too harsh and that they , and their families , have suffered enough for their crimes , " a senior administration official said			1
" commuting their sentences does not diminish the seriousness of their crimes			2
@entity14 and @entity41 are convicted felons who violated their oaths to uphold the law and have been severely punished , " the official stated			1
" this commutation gives them an opportunity to return to their families and communities , but both men will have to carry the burden of being convicted felons and the shame of violating their oaths for the rest of their lives			0
" the official noted that both @entity60 and @entity61 members of @entity62 have supported a commutation , including president - elect @entity66 's incoming @entity65 chief of staff , @entity67 , and @entity69 sens. @entity68 and @entity70			1
the head of the labor union representing @entity6 agents told @entity1 he was " grateful " that @entity2 commuted the sentences but questioned why the prison terms wo n't end until march 20			1
" i would be quite curious to learn why they have to wait another two months for an unjust sentence , " said @entity76 , president of the @entity77			0
he said the union 's ultimate goal would be for the men to get their @entity6 jobs back			0
the shooting happened february 17 , 2005 , on the border southeast of @entity86 , @entity87			0
during their trial , @entity14 and @entity15 said the illegal immigrant , @entity90 , had brandished a gun while actively resisting arrest			1
@entity90 , however , said he was unarmed and was attempting to surrender when @entity15 attempted to beat him with a shotgun			2
@entity90 was shot while fleeing toward the @entity94			0
@entity14 and @entity15 were ultimately convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon , lying about the incident and violating @entity90 's @entity98 right against illegal search and seizure			1
after receiving immunity to testify in the case against the two agents , @entity90 was arrested in 2007 on charges of bringing more than 750 pounds of marijuana into the @entity7			0
the case quickly became a political flash point , with advocates of tighter border controls defending the agents and civil liberties groups saying that the agents had used illegal and excessive force against @entity90			0
@entity2 has granted 189 pardons and 11 commutations over his eight years in office , far fewer than presidents @entity117 and @entity118 in their two - term administrations			2
during the final months of the @entity2 administration , speculation has swirled around the question of whether former vice presidential aide @entity124 would be granted the presidential favor			2
@entity126 was convicted in march of 2007 of four counts of lying and impeding a federal investigation into the leak of information that revealed that @entity132 was a covert @entity133 operative			2
among the more notable people who have applied for -- but not received -- some form of clemency are : former rep. @entity137 , @entity138 , who was convicted of receiving bribes ; publishing executive @entity140 , who was found guilty of fraud ; former junk bold salesman @entity142 , who pleaded guilty to securities fraud ; and former @entity145 ceo @entity144 , convicted of accounting fraud			2
the parents of @entity148 , who was given a 20 - year sentence after pleading guilty to supporting terrorists in @entity151 , held a news conference in december urging @entity2 to commute their son 's sentence			1
there is a long tradition of presidents issuing pardons and commutations during their final days in office			0
@entity117 pardoned fugitive financier @entity161 during his last hours in office , setting off a firestorm of controversy			0
a commutation reduces a convict 's prison term , but the conviction remains on the person 's record			0
a pardon , however , wipes the slate clean by erasing the record of the conviction			0
a president has the sole authority to grant clemency to whomever he chooses , although a @entity22 office usually reviews applications and makes recommendations after considering such standards as a person 's degree of remorse and ability to lead a responsible and productive life after release			0
those applying for a pardon through the @entity22 are required to wait at least five years after their conviction or release from confinement .			0
