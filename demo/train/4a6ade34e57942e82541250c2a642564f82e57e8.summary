so long , margarine : artificial trans fat in foods may eventually become a thing of the past			1
the @entity5 on thursday took a first step toward potentially eliminating most trans fat from the food supply , saying it has made a preliminary determination that a major source of trans fats -- partially hydrogenated oils -- is no longer " generally recognized as safe			1
" if the preliminary determination is finalized , according to the @entity5 , then partially hydrogenated oils will become food additives that could not be used in food without approval			1
foods with unapproved additives can not legally be sold			0
trans fat can be found in processed foods including desserts , microwave popcorn products , frozen pizza , margarine and coffee creamer , and has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease			1
partially hydrogenated oil is formed when hydrogen is added to liquid oils to make solid fats , like shortening and margarine			1
it increases the shelf life and the flavor of foods			0
partially hydrogenated vegetable oil , or shortening , was used in @entity37 kitchens as early as 1911			2
however , in recent years many food manufacturers have taken steps to limit or eliminate trans fat from their products			1
@entity43 's , for instance , stopped cooking its french fries in trans fat more than a decade ago			2
the company 's website says all its fried menu items are free of trans fat			2
@entity50 in 2007 adopted a regulation banning partially hydrogenated vegetable oils and spreads in restaurants			1
mayor @entity55 said thursday that he was encouraged by the @entity5 's move			0
" the groundbreaking public health policies we have adopted here in @entity50 have become a model for the nation for one reason : they 've worked			0
today , @entity50 ' life expectancy is far higher than the national average , and we 've achieved dramatic reductions in disease , including heart disease			0
the @entity5 deserves great credit for taking this step , which will help @entity37 live longer , healthier lives , " @entity55 said			2
photos : the history of trans fat trans fat intake among @entity37 consumers decreased from 4.6 grams per day in 2003 to about a gram a day in 2012 , according to the @entity5			1
however , " current intake remains a significant public health concern , " @entity5 commissioner @entity77 said in a written statement			0
there is no safe level of consumption of trans fat , @entity77 said			2
it has been shown to raise the " bad , " or @entity87 , cholesterol			0
" through our efforts at product reformulation and the development of suitable alternatives , trans fats that are not naturally occurring have been drastically reduced in the food supply , " the @entity89 , which represents more than 300 food , beverage and consumer product companies , said in a prepared statement			2
" since 2005 , food manufacturers have voluntarily lowered the amounts of trans fats in their food products by over 73 %			0
" other countries are also working to reduce trans fat in the food supply			1
policies in @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , the @entity111 , @entity112 and the @entity37 have proved effective over the past two decades , the @entity106 said in april			0
the @entity106 has called for eliminating trans fat from the global food supply			1
who outlines steps to reduce leading causes of death the @entity5 has opened a 60 - day comment period on the determination " to collect additional data and to gain input on the time potentially needed for food manufacturers to reformulate products that currently contain artificial trans fat should this determination be finalized , " the agency said			1
there are two phases to the process , @entity5 officials said thursday			0
the agency will evaluate the comments and evidence received during the comment period			0
" if we finalize our conclusion , then we are inviting comments from industry on what would be an appropriate phaseout , " said @entity135 , the agency 's deputy commissioner for foods			0
" the timeline would be based on the comments we get			0
given the public health impact , we want to move as quickly as we can			0
" the @entity147 noted in a statement the industry 's " tremendous strides " in reducing or eliminating trans fats			0
" we plan to discuss the impact of this proposal on the industry and submit comments , and we will continue to work with our members and the manufacturing supply chain to address any new federal standards that may arise out of this process , " said @entity152 , the association 's vice president of industry affairs and food policy			0
@entity163 called thursday 's move " an important step toward protecting more @entity37 from the potential dangers of trans fat			2
" the @entity168 , the @entity169 and the @entity170 were among those praising the move			0
" the scientific evidence is clear -- eating food with trans fat increases production of ' bad ' cholesterol , which is a risk factor for heart disease , " the @entity168 said			2
so what should consumers do in the meantime ? choose products that have the lowest combined amount of saturated fat , cholesterol and trans fat , the @entity5 said			1
dietary fats : know which types to choose under current regulations , companies can claim their food has 0 grams of trans fat if the food contains less than 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving , according to @entity193 , a consumer safety officer at the @entity5			1
but if partially hydrogenated oil is listed in the ingredients , there may still be a small amount of trans fat present			1
@entity200 , the @entity168 's ceo , said she hopes the @entity5 goes a step further and revises labels for foods that are trans fat free			1
the preliminary determination was based on " available scientific evidence and the findings of expert scientific panels , " the @entity5 said			0
the determination covers only partially hydrogenated oils , not trans fat that naturally occurs in some meat and dairy products			1
trans fat is also present at very low levels in other edible oils , such as fully hydrogenated oils , where it is " unavoidably produced during the manufacturing process , " according to the @entity5			1
avoiding foods containing artificially produced trans fat could prevent 10,000 to 20,000 heart attacks and 3,000 to 7,000 coronary heart disease deaths each year , according to one study from the @entity224			2
" artificial trans fat is a uniquely powerful promoter of heart disease , and today 's announcement will hasten its eventual disappearance from the food supply , " said @entity225 , the @entity170 's executive director			1
" not only is artificial trans fat not safe , it 's not remotely necessary			1
many companies , large and small , have switched to healthier oils over the past decade			0
i hope that those restaurants and food manufacturers that still use this harmful ingredient see the writing on the wall and promptly replace it			0
