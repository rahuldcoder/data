world no. 1 @entity0 plans to take a break from tennis following her shock fourth - round defeat at the @entity6 on sunday			1
the 22 - year - old , who lost 6 - 2 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) to 15th seed @entity8 , said she was jaded after the opening months of the season in which she won her first grand slam at the @entity13 and went on a 26 - match winning streak			1
however , the @entity16 lost in finals in @entity18 and @entity19 before pulling out ahead of a second - round clash against the diminutive @entity8 in @entity21 last month due to a shoulder injury			1
she will lose the top ranking if @entity21 champion @entity25 can reach the final in @entity27 for the first time in her career			1
" there has been a lot of tennis for me in the last five months , " she said			0
" i have n't been home in a while , and it 's something that i need just to get rested mentally , definitely , and just to get out of the tennis field a little bit			2
" and once i have my passion and desire back on the court , i 'll be on the grass			0
" @entity27 goes to @entity41 ? the @entity43 effect @entity0 had previously lost to the @entity44 just once in eight meetings , but five of those had gone to three sets and two were remarkable comeback victories			2
she had to come from a set and 4 - 0 down in her opening match in @entity27 last monday , but could not pull off an escape this time as she smashed two rackets in frustration			2
" today i could n't do it			0
it was just not going for me			0
all i could hope for was her mistakes , " @entity0 said			2
" i think she plays much better against the top players than maybe a little bit lower - ranked players			1
she really has that desire			0
i do n't know what motivates her to play that way			0
" @entity8 reached the @entity6 semifinals in 2009 , but said she was nervous she would again blow her advantage against @entity0 -- who stands nine inches taller at six foot			1
" you ca n't be human if you were n't thinking about that , " she said			0
" because this year in @entity72 i was 6 - 1 5 - 2 up against her			2
and last year in @entity72 it was the same			0
" today it happened the same when i was 4 - 2 up			2
and that 's why i got a little bit ... not nervous , but not going for my shots anymore			0
" but today it was a great thing that i managed to go through these emotions			0
she was 6 - 5 up , and i said , ' hey , come on , you have to play your game again and just make it			0
' " the 23 - year - old will next face @entity86 champion @entity85 of @entity87 , who beat 79th - ranked @entity89 teenager @entity88			1
sixth seed @entity85 , the @entity6 runner - up in 2010 , ended the 19 - year - old 's dream run as she won 7 - 5 6 - 4 in 85 minutes			1
@entity88 lost in the first round last year and has not won a match in three attempts at her home grand slam			0
@entity100 's @entity99 earlier reached the quarterfinals after beating 2009 @entity6 champion @entity102			1
the 21st seed , who also made the last eight in @entity106 in january and has won three clay titles this season , won 6 - 0 7 - 5 to set up a clash with @entity110			1
the @entity112 10th seed , who lost to @entity85 in the @entity115 semifinals in september in her best grand slam achievement , ended the hopes of 21 - year - old @entity119 @entity118 as she won 6 - 3 7 - 5 on court @entity120 .			1

top - ranked @entity0 beaten in last - 16 clash by @entity124 's @entity8
@entity126 loses to the 15th seed for only the second time in nine encounters
