@entity0 -- @entity3 's mother and four of his siblings announced monday a tribute concert for the late pop singer to be held in @entity8 in october , but the lineup for talent is still a secret			1
@entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , sister @entity15 and family matriarch @entity17 attended the " @entity20 " announcement at the @entity19 on monday morning			2
but the announcement exposed a major rift among members of the @entity23 , especially with @entity3 brothers @entity24 and @entity26 , who did not attend the news conference			1
they objected to the show because it 's scheduled to happen during the criminal trial of the doctor accused in @entity3 's death			1
" we want to make clear that this does not reflect the position of the entire family , " the two brothers said in a joint statement			0
" while we wholeheartedly support the spirit of a tribute that honors our brother , we find it impossible to support an event that is due to take place during the criminal trial surrounding @entity3 's death , " they said			1
while the head of the @entity49 company promoting the show , @entity50 , hinted it could include a @entity3 brothers reunion , the statement from @entity24 and @entity26 on monday indicated that would not happen			1
" in light of this , we feel it is inappropriate to be involved with such an ill - timed event and its promoter , @entity59 , " @entity26 and @entity53 said			1
their statement said the idea of the october concert was presented to the entire family in april " as an idea already in its advanced stages			0
" the decision to go ahead with it " disrespects opinions and wishes expressed in the strongest terms " by some members of the @entity23 , they said			0
@entity15 said the " tribute will be something that 's spectacular " and is " far , far , well overdue			1
' the @entity75 ' mother called it " a show fit for a king , " " if my son were here today , he would feel the same way , " @entity17 said			2
executors for the late pop singer 's estate were unaware of the planned tribute , estate spokesman @entity81 told @entity1			2
" the estate has not been contacted and is not involved with @entity87 in the @entity89 tribute concert announced today , " he said			2
the show will " feature the world 's most amazing music performers , " according to the head of @entity49 promoter @entity59			0
the roster will be revealed online one act at a time over the next two weeks , starting tuesday , @entity95 said			0
all profits from the show would go to several @entity102 and @entity49 charities , including a cancer group created by the @entity104 , @entity95 said			0
the october 8 show , in the @entity106 in @entity107 , @entity8 , would be at least four hours long , @entity95 said			0
the venue will seat up to 75,000 people , he said			0
" i know my brother would be very , very proud to see all the artists that he admired and respected so much coming together for this event , " @entity13 said			0
@entity95 presented the @entity23 with a $ 100,000 check that will go to a trust fund for @entity3 's three children , which they can access when they turn 21			2
the children , @entity17 and unidentified charities are the sole beneficiaries of @entity3 's wealthy estate .			1
