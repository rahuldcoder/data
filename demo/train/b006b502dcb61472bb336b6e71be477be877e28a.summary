-- new hiv infections have fallen worldwide by 17 percent over the past eight years , a testament to prevention efforts , according to a @entity4 report released tuesday			1
in addition , the number of people living with @entity7 , the virus that causes @entity8 , has increased , and over the last five years , @entity8 deaths have declined by 10 percent , thanks to antiretroviral drug therapy and access to lifesaving treatments , said the report by the @entity16 on @entity8 and @entity17			1
however , not all the news was good as researchers found evidence that some prevention programs miss the mark because they are not tailored for different populations affected by the epidemic			0
@entity25 was seen particularly in @entity26 , where new infections declined about 15 percent , or some 400,000 people , according to the report			1
however , that area remains the region hardest - hit by the virus , accounting for 67 percent of infections worldwide , the report said			1
" the epidemic continues to have an enormous impact on households , communities , businesses , public services and national economies in the region , " it said			0
in 2008 , for instance , more than 14.1 million children in @entity26 were estimated to have lost one or both parents to @entity8			1
in @entity47 , new infections declined by nearly 25 percent , and by 10 percent in @entity49 and @entity50 , the organizations said			2
in @entity53 , a region that had seen a dramatic increase in new infections among intravenous drug users , " the epidemic has leveled off considerably , " the report said			2
in @entity53 and @entity57 , an hiv epidemic that once resulted from injected drug use is spreading to the sexual partners of those drug users , according to the report			0
and in some parts of @entity50 , heterosexual couples are being affected			0
the prevalence of @entity7 continues to increase in those regions because of the new infections , the report said			1
and in @entity71 in southern @entity26 , more than two - thirds of adult infections occur in people 25 and older , but few programs are aimed at those adults , the report said			1
while the decline in new infections is welcome , " if we do a better job of getting resources and programs to where they will make most impact , quicker progress can be made and more lives saved , " said @entity76 , executive director of @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity79			1
there is also an increased evidence of risk among key populations , the report said			0
for instance , although high prevalence among sex workers has been widely noted , evidence was limited on the prevalence among men engaging in homosexual activity and intravenous drug users			0
" in recent years , studies have documented elevated levels of infection in these populations in nearly all regions , " according to the report			0
" in all settings and for diverse types of epidemics , it is clear that programs to prevent new infections among these key populations must constitute an important part of national @entity8 responses			2
" also , the level of resources directed at prevention programs for those key groups is " typically quite low , even in concentrated epidemics , " according to the report			0
another shortage can be seen in the programs that are designed for people living with @entity7 .			2

new infections in @entity26 15 percent lower in 2008 , report says
that area remains the region hardest - hit by @entity7
decline *attributed* in part to @entity7 prevention efforts , @entity77 official says
