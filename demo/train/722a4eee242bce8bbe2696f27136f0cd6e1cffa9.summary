-- one of the great @entity2 ideals is the importance of taking part , bringing together athletes of all backgrounds from all around the world			0
but not everyone has had the chance to compete			0
@entity10 is one of only three countries -- along with @entity13 and @entity14 -- which have never sent female athletes to an @entity2			1
that may change in @entity17 this year after a groundbreaking meeting with @entity2 and @entity10 officials , but it raises a bigger question -- are the @entity24 kingdom 's women actually ready to compete in top international sporting competitions ? the plan , at this stage , is to send @entity10 women to the @entity30 capital for the july 27 - august 12 event			1
the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) met with @entity34 officials this week			2
" a list of potential female athletes for the @entity2 was presented			2
this will now be studied by the @entity32 together with the relevant @entity40 in order to assess the level of each athlete , " ran a statement on the @entity32 's website			1
it 's a significant development , says @entity45 , host of @entity0 's @entity46 , but the move might come a bit too late for @entity10 's female athletes			1
" when you talk to @entity10 women , even those who are professionals , they tell you that they are not even qualified , " @entity45 said			2
" we 're not even close , " says @entity52 , co-founder of @entity53			0
" at this point , we are trying to make it on a national level , integrate into public schools and then maybe compete on a regional level before we even think of the @entity2 , " @entity55 , who is also captain of the @entity10 women 's basketball team , told @entity0			1
@entity55 says that @entity13 and @entity14 's non-participation at the @entity64 four years ago was n't because they did n't allow women to compete , but rather their female athletes just were n't at the required @entity2 standard			1
" we will need a long time , " she concedes			0
@entity10 is a conservative country which has historically failed to promote women 's participation in sport , says @entity74 of @entity75			1
" government policy has n't been effectively challenged -- there is a predominant conservative view in society that does n't afford women equality in a number of issues , including sports , " @entity74 , senior researcher in the organization 's @entity76 and @entity78 , told @entity0			0
the @entity32 says an assessment of each athlete 's capabilities will make up part of a formal proposal which will be submitted to the @entity93 next meeting which takes place in @entity95 in may			1
" the @entity32 is confident that @entity10 is working to include women athletes and officials at the @entity2 in @entity17 in accordance with the @entity40 ' rules , " the @entity32 said			1
@entity74 believes the move is a " very positive " development			2
" i think international public pressure by the @entity32 and public media pressure helped get us where we are today , " he said			2
" the goal has to be trying to open up the possibilities , the access for women to sports in @entity10			2
" but he added a note of caution			0
" the female participation in the @entity2 is a symbolic leap forward , but in order for it not to remain symbolic it 's really for the @entity10 authorities to start acting , " @entity74 said			1
" if sporting opportunities truly increase , i think it will have a broader impact on life for women			1
" @entity45 said recent @entity10 government reforms , aimed at putting more women in the workforce , gave them encouragement for a greater role in society			0
" there is high unemployment , it is 17 % across @entity10 -- 7 % among men , and 28 % among women , " she said			0
" but it is interesting that 55 - 57 % of the university graduates are women			0
so @entity10 women are ready			0
this decision is quite symbolic -- even if it 's only on the sports level , it will reflect on all levels in @entity10 , on the economy			1
" definitely it will get women more involved			0
however , women are battling with conservative views			0
many people in @entity10 think it 's un-islamic to work , un-islamic to be in sports			2
" even some of these ladies i saw , among the sports team , they had to veil just to prove that they are conservative , very @entity156 and traditional , but that they can play sports and compete internationally			0
