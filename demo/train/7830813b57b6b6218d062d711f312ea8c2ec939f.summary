for the 108,000 women who are diagnosed with lung cancer each year , @entity0 can be a lonely time of year			1
lung cancer kills nearly twice as many women as breast cancer			1
but november , unlike october and @entity7 , goes practically unnoticed : no sea of ribbons , no colored @entity11 cleats , no national monuments aglow in pink			0
breast cancer is a terrible disease			2
my grandmother fought and beat it twice , benefiting from innovative treatments that have propelled five - year survival rates to 90 %			2
but the five - year survival rate for lung cancer has hovered around 16 % for decades			1
and for someone like my mom , who was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer , the survival rate is an appallingly low 4 %			1
an indiscriminate killer , lung cancer takes more lives annually than breast , prostate , colon and pancreatic cancers combined			1
the disease has not generally received the public attention or research dollars in proportion to its devastating lethality			2
lung cancer receives just $ 1,442 in federal research funds per death , compared with $ 26,398 for breast cancer and $ 13,419 for prostate cancer according to an @entity45 study			1
factor in private donations , and the funding gap becomes even more staggering			0
often portrayed as a " smoker 's disease , " the majority of those diagnosed with lung cancer are former smokers or have never smoked at all			1
and while smoking history should n't matter as nicotine is highly addictive , all lung cancer patients face the same unrelenting stigma			1
my mom never smoked -- in fact , studies show one in five women diagnosed with lung cancer never smoked -- and so her lingering , months - long cough did n't trigger any red flags			1
in fact , her doctors were certain she had pneumonia			0
that is until her ct scan came back showing the mass in her lung			2
an otherwise healthy , vibrant , beautiful woman , my mom was given less than a year to live			2
thanks to advancements in targeted therapies , my mom survived -- thrived , in many respects -- for more than 40 months			0
she lived long enough to walk me down the aisle , attend my youngest brother 's high school graduation , watch my dad make a lasagna from scratch and fulfill a lifetime wish to hike the hills of @entity86 and visit the @entity87			0
but in july 2013 , after an unbelievably courageous and inspiring fight , my mom passed away			0
it 's impossible to describe adequately how special my mom was			0
she was incredibly caring , equanimous , brave and nonjudgmental			0
she possessed patience and calmness so rarely encountered -- and in short supply in a family full of strong personalities			0
she was the ballast that kept our family upright and moving forward			0
while lung cancer robbed my family of an unbelievably special mom and spouse , there is so much we can do to ensure happier endings for other lung cancer patients and their families			1
whether you are a lung cancer survivor , caregiver , advocate or just someone who wants to join the fight , there is much we can do to bring our country 's no. 1 cancer killer out of the shadows			1
@entity115 , free to @entity116 , the @entity117 or the @entity118 for great resources , local events and patient support groups			0
write a letter to your local newspaper , urging greater public awareness or encouraging corporate sponsors to step up in support of the lung cancer fight			1
join the growing @entity128 ( lung cancer social media ) community on @entity132			2
if you are in a high - risk group -- a heavy long - term smoker -- see your doctor about ct screening			0
sadly , over the next five years , more than 1 million @entity137 will be diagnosed with lung cancer			1
they will be our mothers , fathers , siblings , grandparents , co-workers and closest friends			0
together , we can help them .			0

@entity0 does n't get attention it *deserves* , @entity146 says
one in five women diagnosed with lung cancer never smoked
some 108,000 women are diagnosed with lung cancer each year
