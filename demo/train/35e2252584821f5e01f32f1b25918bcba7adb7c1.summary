-- @entity1 said he was sorry from the bottom of his heart wednesday for gunning down an unarmed young woman on the front porch of his @entity7 home , but a judge said " mistake " was the wrong word to describe a murder and sentenced him to 15 to 30 years in prison			1
@entity1 , 55 , looked down , his lawyer patting him on the back , as @entity17 circuit judge @entity16 sentenced him for second - degree murder in the november shooting death of @entity20 , 19 -- a racially charged case because the victim was black and @entity1 is white			1
@entity1 had testified that he feared for his life when loud banging startled him awake in the early morning hours of november 2 , 2013			2
he opened his front door and fired a fatal shotgun blast into the face of @entity20 , who prosecutors say was seeking help after a car accident			1
" to the parents family and friends of @entity20 , i apologize from the bottom of my heart and i am truly sorry for your loss , " @entity1 said			1
" i can only hope and pray that some how you can forgive me			0
... from my fear , i caused the lost of a life that was too young to leave this world and for that i carry that guilt and sorrow forever			0
" @entity16 said it was one of the " saddest cases " she had ever presided over			0
" i do not believe that you are a cold - blood murderer or that this case had anything to do with race or that you are some sort of monster , " the judge said			2
" i do believe you acted out of some fear but mainly anger and panic and unjustified fear is never an excuse to take someone 's life			0
" @entity16 said she was confident @entity1 was remorseful and would likely never commit another crime in his life , but that @entity20 came to his doorstep seeking help and lost her life			1
" you made the choices that brought us here , " the judge said			0
" i do n't know that you could ever use the word ' mistake ' to describe a murder , and a person was murdered			1
" the defense had argued for a sentence of four to seven years , saying a longer sentence guaranteed that he would never get out of prison alive			2
but @entity16 said the sentencing guidelines were reasonable for the crime , giving him 15 to 30 years for second - degree murder and two additional years for possessing a firearm while committing the felony			1
before sentencing , @entity81 , @entity20 's father , addressed the court			2
" this man has ruined our family 's life , " he said " there 's not a day that goes by that i do n't think about my daughter			0
" @entity20 's sister , @entity92 , said : " losing my sister was one of the most devastating times of my life			2
mr. @entity1 , your actions impact a lot of other people other than just yourself			0
" after @entity1 was convicted in august , @entity20 's mother , @entity101 , described her daughter as a " regular teenager " who was " well - raised and brought up with a loving family			1
" during his trial , @entity1 testified feeling the floor vibrate under his feet from the violent pounding on his front and kitchen doors			1
he said he could n't find his cell phone to call 911 , but retrieved his @entity114 12 - gauge shotgun from a closet and opened the front door at a quiet moment			1
" i was not going to cower			0
i did n't want to be a victim in my own house , " he said			0
" i drew first , that 's how i see it			0
" @entity20 had a blood - alcohol level more than two times the legal limit at the time of her death and had smoked marijuana earlier in the evening , according to testimony			1
witnesses said she crashed her vehicle into a parked car in @entity131 , @entity7 , just before 1 a.m. and wandered off disoriented and bloodied			0
some three hours later , she lay dead on @entity1 's porch			1
the incident sparked protest and was likened by some to the shooting of unarmed @entity138 teen @entity137 in 2012			0
after the incident , @entity1 told police he was angry and " full of piss and vinegar " when he opened the door that night , according to prosecutors			2
@entity0 's @entity145 contributed to this report .			0
