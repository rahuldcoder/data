the news led to another night of protests in major cities nationwide , including @entity0 president @entity26 vowed not to " let up " in his efforts to ease racial tensions , and some @entity30 tried to channel demonstrators ' outrage in their reactions overnight and into thursday morning			0
and it was a rare development that brought members of both parties together in calling for further investigation			0
rep. @entity38 , chairwoman of the @entity39 , said thursday morning that the @entity39 should " absolutely " hold hearings to investigate @entity15 's death			1

" referring to @entity62 ' call for hearings , house speaker @entity60 said he would not " rule that in or out , " but said there are " a lot of unanswered questions that @entity67 have , and frankly i have			2
" " i do think that the @entity67 people deserve more answers about what really happened here and was our system of justice handled properly , " @entity60 said thursday during a press conference			1

@entity103 called the altercation between @entity15 and the police officer , which was caught on video , a " living breathing example of probable cause to indict			2
" nearly a dozen times , @entity15 tries telling the officer that he ca n't breathe and @entity103 noted that @entity15 " even put his hands up in the air , " but @entity85 " continued to choke him			2
" protests featuring slogans like " hands up , do n't shoot , " " @entity141 lives matter " and now " i ca n't breathe " broke out again wednesday in reaction to the @entity149 grand jury 's decision as demonstrators called for justice for @entity15 and @entity22 , the black teenager who was shot by police officer @entity152 in @entity19 this summer			1
