@entity0 , @entity1 -- floating in a life raft with @entity7 raging around them , the crew of the @entity5 remained surprisingly calm and even told jokes after their ship rolled them into the @entity11 , survivors said			1
testifying friday before a @entity15 hearing , former bounty third mate @entity12 and boatswain @entity13 revealed breathtaking details about the shipwreck last fall that left a deckhand dead and the captain missing			1
the vessel and its crew of 16 were heading from @entity24 , @entity25 , to @entity26 , @entity27 , when it ran into @entity7 's vicious winds and waves 90 miles off @entity30			1
the ship began taking on water and eventually it lost power to its pumps and engines			2
in the 4 a.m. darkness of october 25 , capt. @entity36 gave the order they all knew was coming : abandon ship			1
dressed in red survival suits , they stood on deck preparing to take to their lifeboats			2
suddenly 50 - mph winds and up to 30 - foot waves flipped the ship horizontally , tossing the crew overboard			1
" everybody panicked at that point , " said @entity13 , fighting back tears as she described the struggle to keep their heads above water			2
@entity59 said he recalled being " thrown around , caught on stuff and underneath stuff and being hit by things			2
" while they were treading water under the @entity5 's huge sails , the wind began slamming the sail rigging down " on all of us repeatedly , " said @entity13			1
" we were doing our best to swim away from the boat and the rig			2
" @entity59 , @entity13 and a few other crew members found a large piece of wood grating that kept them afloat			1
" we were all looking for each other , " @entity12 said , " but all you could see was a bunch of red suits and there was a lot of yelling			2
" in a stroke of luck , the crew clinging to the wood grating found a floating capsule containing an inflatable life raft			1
with some difficulty they inflated the raft and got inside			2
they had seen a @entity15 aircraft circling overhead , giving them confidence a rescue helicopter would arrive soon			1
" we were there for a while telling jokes and stuff , " said @entity12			2
" no one was in a bad mood -- crying or anything			2
" he said they talked about the terrifying experience they 'd just been through and " what we were going to do when we got home			1
" " at some point we sang a few sea shanties , " recalled @entity13			2
" we were in relatively good spirits			2
" @entity112 broke , followed by the the sound of a @entity15 chopper , which dropped a rescue swimmer down to the life raft			1
" he said , ' hi , i 'm @entity118 , ' " @entity119 remembered			2
" ' i heard you guys need a ride			0
let 's get out of here			0
' " while the swimmer was helping survivors get out of the life raft , it flipped upside down			0
" we all thought we were going to drown again , " remembered @entity13			0
instead , they swam out of the raft and held on to the outside until the chopper hoisted them to safety			0

during his testimony , @entity59 was asked about the last time he saw deckhand @entity145 , 42			0
more than three months after the shipwreck , the exact circumstances surrounding her death remain unclear			0
before the ship rolled , @entity59 said he remembered holding @entity153 's hand as he helped her and other crew members prepare to launch the life rafts			1
searchers found @entity145 's body later that evening			0
related : @entity145 's mutineer connection the final glimpse @entity59 got of @entity161 , 63 , was just before the ship went on its side			0
@entity36 's body has not been found			0
his widow said she believes the captain died trying to help @entity153 escape			1
related : @entity5 's captain was ' my soul mate ' @entity170 was much more than a creaky 50 - year - old wooden tourist attraction			1
it was a bona fide @entity173 star , featured in the 1962 film version of " @entity175 , " which starred @entity176 , and more recently in the " @entity179 " franchise that starred @entity178			0
but it also was a ship where inexperienced sailors could learn seafaring skills that go back hundreds of years			0
the hearings , which include the @entity184 , could lead to federal recommendations aimed at improving safety for other ships like the @entity5			1
investigators in this military shipyard region near the mouth of @entity191 have been asking two basic questions : was the @entity170 fit to sail in rough weather ? and did the ship needlessly sail into harm 's way ? about two months before the disaster , @entity36 , a master sailor with a lifetime of experience at sea , played down the seriousness of sailing through bad weather			1
" have we run into stormy seas ? we chase hurricanes , " @entity36 said in a video interview posted on @entity207			0
" you do n't want to get in front of it , " he said			0
" you want to stay behind it , but you also get a good ride out of a hurricane			0
" asked about that comment by @entity36 , @entity12 testified that the captain did n't mean literally chasing hurricanes			1
" it means we are trying to follow them into a navigable , safer " area of the storm , he said			0
the idea was " getting behind it , in a safe place " to make use of its favorable winds			0
" you do n't want to be in its path			0
" before the ship set sail from @entity24 , the crew was very aware of the approaching hurricane , @entity59 said			1
@entity36 gathered them for a meeting in which he " mentioned his experience with hurricanes and he said if anybody wanted to leave there would be no hard feelings , no begrudging			0
" " i believed him , " said @entity12 , who was then asked if the crew were offered paid expenses home			1
" in my experience , if you choose to leave , you would have to find your own way home			1
" " nobody decided to leave , " @entity12 said			0
@entity36 said he wanted to " make tracks " to the south and east as fast as possible , @entity59 said , so the vessel could position itself to get the best winds from @entity7			1
the captain believed , @entity59 said , that his ship would be safer riding @entity7 out at sea , instead of waiting for the storm to hit them in @entity24			1
@entity59 said he agreed with that point of view , but there were also good arguments to remain in port			2
bounty first mate @entity264 testified tuesday that @entity36 was n't chasing @entity7 , but the captain had said " the ship was safer at sea			1
" @entity264 testified that as the storm worsened on october 29 , he advised @entity36 to abandon ship more than once over a short period			0
" he said , ' i think we have more time			0
' " when @entity264 made a third request to the captain to abandon ship , he said @entity36 finally gave the order			1
while the 13 other crew members , including @entity13 and @entity59 , made it safely to two life rafts , @entity264 spent three hours floating alone in his survival suit before @entity15 rescuers saw his emergency beacon			1
the @entity15 said its goal for the investigation is to determine as much as possible about the cause of the tragedy and whether it was linked to equipment or material failure			1
investigators are looking for evidence of " misconduct , inattention to duty , negligence or willful violation of the law			2
" did @entity36 make a fatal error ? people who were n't there have no right to pass judgment , the captain 's widow , @entity297 , said last week from her home in @entity26			1
although it 's not a criminal hearing , @entity5 owner @entity304 declined to testify , citing his @entity308 constitutional protections against self - incrimination			1
evidence could be forwarded to federal prosecutors			0
in thursday 's testimony , @entity312 of @entity314 's @entity313 said he raised doubts about @entity5 's seaworthiness weeks before it sailed into the storm			1
he said he told @entity36 he was worried about rotting wood in the @entity5 's frame			1
@entity36 , @entity312 said , decided against fixing the rot			0
" i believe that that could have had an impact on the strength of the vessel , " @entity312 said			0
@entity325 , a retired manager who worked at the shipyard for four decades , told investigators he disagreed with @entity312 's analysis			2
the decay of the @entity5 's timbers , he said , was n't as bad as @entity312 's assessment			1
" he 's basing his judgment on probably five or six years of experience , " @entity325 testified			0
@entity145 's father , @entity336 , and her mother -- who shares her daughter 's first name but goes by @entity341 -- were also at the hearing			0
for now , they 've declined to speak with reporters			0
their daughter was relatively new to sailing , and told friends in may how excited she was to join the @entity5			1
a former beauty queen , @entity145 also said she was a descendant of @entity350 , the infamous mutineer on the real @entity5 220 years ago			1
on friday , her mother sat silently at the side of the hearing room , dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief and sometimes taking notes			0
the memory of @entity145 took a seat at the proceding almost as real as any of the participants			0
several questions focused on the energetic deckhand who had virtually no experience aboard a tall ship , let alone riding out hurricanes			0
when @entity59 helped her move toward the back of the ship , shortly before it went horizontal , he " told her to stay low			0
i told her to go aft and to grab the next person i would hand her to			0
" she never made it home			2
during a brief recess , @entity153 's parents paused at a window near the hearing room in this shipyard town , their arms around each other , looking across the @entity379 flowing toward the sea			2
@entity2 's @entity381 contributed to this report .			0
