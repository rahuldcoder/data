-- a memo reportedly written two years ago by maj. @entity3 's supervisor at @entity4 says the accused @entity6 shooter demonstrated " a pattern of poor judgment and a lack of professionalism " during his residency at the hospital			1
@entity14 obtained what it said is a copy of the memo , posting on @entity14 a retyped version that the network said was a " transcript " of the memo and " not a facsimile or @entity23 of the actual document			2
" " the faculty has serious concerns about @entity31 's professionalism and work ethic , " said the memo , signed by maj. @entity26 , the residency program 's director			1
" clinically he is competent to deliver safe patient care			0
but he demonstrates a pattern of poor judgment and a lack of professionalism			0
" read document obtained by @entity14 @entity0 could not corroborate the authenticity of the memo nor reach @entity26 for comment			1
last week , @entity26 said he could not comment about differing accounts of @entity3 's behavior and disciplinary record			1
@entity3 's supervisor at @entity46 , col. @entity47 , has said that @entity3 's evaluations from @entity4 contained some information that concerned her , but the concerns triggered an approach to integrate @entity3 into the staff that she said had been successful			1
" the types of things that were reported to me via his evaluation report were things that concerned me , but did not raise red flags toward this [ the shootings ] in any way , shape or form , " she said , adding that @entity3 " was doing a really good job for us			2
" @entity3 , still hospitalized in @entity67 , has been charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder in the november 5 shooting at @entity6			0
the memo obtained by @entity14 said that @entity3 , then a captain , was " counseled for inappropriately discussing religious topics " with patients and went through a remediation program for inappropriate documentation of his handling of a homicidal patient during an emergency room encounter			1
the document said @entity3 's remediation on that problem was successful but added that he was placed on administrative probation at the end of the year for not taking and passing the @entity86 @entity85			1
he later corrected that problem as well , the memo said			0
the memo also noted a poor attendance record and lower - than - expected scores on the @entity92 , a yearly exam that @entity3 failed to take during one of his residency years			2
in his final year of residency , the memo said , @entity3 saw 30 patients in 38 weeks and was required to use elective class time to make up the lost clinic time			2
and , it said , he missed a night of emergency room on - call duty and did not respond to @entity26 's pages the next day			0
" these issues demonstrate a lack of professionalism and work ethics , " the memo said			0
" he is able to self - correct with supervision			0
however , at this point he should not need so much supervision			0
" the memo concluded , however , that @entity3 's record was not enough to indicate " he is not competent to graduate " or that further academic probation would be helpful			1
" he would be able to contain his behavior enough to complete any period of probation successfully , " the memo said .			0
