' @entity1 ' completed his first nine holes in a mere 28 shots to put the world 's media on 59 alert again before closing with an eight - under 63 for the early lead at the @entity14			1
two bogeys coming home on the front nine , he started on the 10th tee , scuppered the hopes of headline writers , but he did mix that with a superb eagle on the second , nearly holing his approach for an albatross			2
playing his last hole , the 43 - year - old @entity25 need a birdie to equal the course record 61 of @entity29 back in 2008 , but instead made a five for an anti climactic ending after finding trouble off the tee			0
nonetheless he had outplayed playing partners @entity32 , who is still well placed after a 68 and @entity35 champion @entity35 , winner of the @entity36 last week , but struggling to an opening 73			1
@entity1 , who carded seven birdies in his first nine holes , said he always knew it would be a little tougher on the next nine			1

@entity44 @entity43 later matched @entity1 's eight - under effort to leave them one clear of in - form @entity47 in the second tournament of the money spinning @entity51			1
earlier this season , @entity1 narrowly missed a birdie putt on the last green as he opened with a 60 at the @entity55 , going on to win the tournament by four shots			2
and in testing final round conditions at @entity59 , @entity1 conjured up four birdies in the last six holes to claim the @entity63 title for the first time			1
it was the fifth major of his career and he admitted afterwards probably the most satisfying , particularly after having to settle for his sixth runner - up spot at the preceding @entity68 won by @entity69			0
defending champion @entity70 of @entity71 admitted to " silly mistakes " after opening with a one - under 70 , looking to kick start a disappointing season after his heroics of 2012			0
