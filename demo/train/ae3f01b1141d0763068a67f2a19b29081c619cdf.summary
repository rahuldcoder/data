@entity0 , @entity1 -- a judge is considering a jury recommendation that a former @entity6 lacrosse player be sentenced up to 26 years in prison for his role in the death of his ex-girlfriend			1
a jury returned the recommendation late wednesday , hours after finding @entity13 , 24 , guilty of second - degree murder and grand larceny in the may 2010 death of @entity17			1
the case captured national attention with a spotlight shown on the volatile relationship of star athletes @entity13 and 22 - year - old @entity23 , who both played lacrosse for the university 's nationally - ranked teams			1
judge @entity27 is expected to schedule @entity13 's sentencing date on april 16 , at which time he can accept or reduce the jury 's recommendation			1
outside the courtroom , @entity0 @entity32 's attorney @entity31 told reporters that " what we do in court is a very rough approximation of justice in any given case			2
" there 's nothing that we can say that will make good the terrible and tragic loss to the @entity23 family , " @entity31 said			2
" there are no winners in this case			2
there is nothing but loss everywhere			2
" he did not take any questions , saying he would wait until after sentencing to comment further			2
@entity13 's attorney , @entity53 , said he was disappointed in the verdict , saying his client displayed " amazing resilience and courage			1
" " he 's hopeful			2
he 's spiritual , " he said in brief comments following the verdict			0
" and we look forward to some corrections on what happened here tonight			0
" it was unclear whether @entity53 planned to appeal the verdict			0
the jury did not agree with the prosecution that @entity13 was guilty of first - degree murder , and it acquitted him on several other charges , including robbery , and breaking and entering to commit larceny			1
@entity13 has never denied he was in @entity23 's apartment nor that they had a fight			1
at the center of the case were dueling portraits of @entity13 , who prosecutors contend killed @entity23 in a jealous rage while the defense argued the death was accidental			1
prosecutors claimed @entity13 followed through with a threat to kill @entity23 after accusing her of allegedly having a liaison with a lacrosse player from a competing university			1
" i should have killed you , " he wrote in an e-mail to @entity23 , which was read during the trial			0
but the defense argued that @entity13 contributed to her death but had no intention of killing her			1
@entity53 described his client as " stupid , drunk -- but not calculating			0
" police were initially called to @entity23 's off - campus @entity0 apartment by a roommate who reported a possible alcohol overdose , authorities said at the time			0
a medical examiner found @entity23 died of blunt force trauma to the head			0
the prosecution told jurors that @entity23 's death was slow and painful , claiming she could have remained alive for a couple of hours after @entity13 left her apartment			1
inside an emotionally - charged courtroom , @entity13 hung his head and appeared to cry during his attorney 's plea during the sentencing phase that directly followed the jury 's verdict			1
" @entity13 's decision and judgment were clouded by drinking , immaturity , " attorney @entity115 told the jurors			1
" it 's not an excuse			0
it 's not a justification			0
it 's just a fact ... ( at the time ) @entity13 is a 22 - year - old immersed in sex and alcohol			1
" @entity23 's mother , @entity129 , and sister , @entity130 , both cried during their testimony in the sentencing phase , which saw two female jurors cry			2
" every year that goes by , i 'm afraid i 'm forgetting a little piece of her , " @entity23 told the court			0
@entity138 told the jurors that not a day goes by that she does n't think about what happened to her sister			0
" first , there 's the shock			0
and then that wears off , and it becomes reality , " she said			0
" ... i 've never wanted anything so much in life as i 've wanted to see her face again			0
" @entity154 's @entity153 and @entity155 contributed to this report .			0
