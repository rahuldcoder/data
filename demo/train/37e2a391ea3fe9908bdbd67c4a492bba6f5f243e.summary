they thought that life could not get much harsher			2
but that was before winter storm " @entity26 " moved in , bringing snow , rain and freezing temperatures across the region			1
despite the miserable conditions , for many children in refugee camps , the snow was a novelty			1

" i saw the snowman in front of a tent and thought it would make a good picture , " he said			2
" then the boy appeared , and smiled as i took his photo			2
then he looked away , distracted as more people arrived			2
we were in a rush to finish filming so i never got to talk to him			2
" " but just look at the smile			2
the snowman symbolizes so much too			2

" that 's not going to happen soon			0
