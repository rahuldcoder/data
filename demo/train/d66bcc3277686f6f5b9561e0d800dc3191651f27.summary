@entity0 -- @entity2 , the former @entity3 senator , conservative social crusader and perpetual @entity6 presidential candidate , sounded a downcast note over the weekend when asked about the possibility of another @entity9 run in 2016			1
" yeah , i do n't know if i can do this , " @entity2 told the @entity10			2
" it 's just tough			0
" @entity2 cited the health of his 5 - year - old daughter @entity14 , who suffers from the genetic disorder @entity16 8 , and a new job as the ceo at a faith - oriented movie company as reasons why he may pass on a repeat @entity9 run			1
earlier : @entity2 ' very open ' to another presidential bid left unsaid : the @entity6 field is shaping up to be more impressive this time , making the path to the nomination even more difficult for the 2012 @entity6 runner - up , who came close to toppling frontrunner @entity31 during their winter primary clash by rallying @entity35 conservatives and working class primary voters to his side			1
still , despite his candor about the challenges ahead , @entity2 is very much keeping his name in the 2016 mix and relentlessly plugging away behind - the - scenes			1
earlier : @entity2 's busy day in @entity45 few republicans question @entity2 's work ethic			2
his early - and - often visits with grassroots activists in all of @entity45 's 99 counties helped propel him to a breakout win in the @entity45 caucuses in 2012			1
but @entity2 is doing something different this time : he 's making early connections with establishment leaders in the leadoff nominating states , an effort to make himself more palatable to powerful @entity6 who were reluctant to embrace him in 2012 because of his unyielding views on social issues and his sometimes dour temperament			1
a trip last month to the early primary state of @entity62 revealed just how much political work @entity2 is doing away from public view — and how badly he wants to be taken seriously by @entity6 forces who had trouble seeing him as their party 's standard - bearer against president @entity71			1
earlier : @entity2 @entity62 bound here 's a look at how much activity @entity2 packed into a single 36 - hour political tour of @entity62 : — on april 14 , @entity2 arrived in @entity75 , where two of his sons are cadets at @entity78 , for some family time			1
but @entity62 is n't just where his sons reside — it 's a closely - watched primary state where @entity6 presidential hopefuls test their support among southern conservatives			1
@entity2 addressed a luncheon on campus hosted by the @entity86 , and while there , he gabbed with former @entity62 attorney general @entity87 , a fixture of the state 's @entity6 establishment and a candidate for lieutenant governor this year			1
— @entity2 made time in between to take questions from reporters , dissing the " weakness " of @entity71 's foreign policy and calling on republicans to do a better job relating to working class @entity97 instead of big business			1
the latter message , of course , doubled as a plug for the new book he 's hawking , " @entity106 conservatives			0
" — later that evening , @entity2 delivered remarks to the @entity108 , one of the state 's most active county @entity6 organizations			1
also in @entity75 , @entity2 raised money for @entity114 , a 501 ( c ) 4 group that advocates for conservative causes and helps fund his travel to very important places — like states that have presidential caucuses and primaries			2
— the following morning , @entity2 was escorted around @entity121 , the state capital and its political hub , by a @entity62 friend , and veteran of the 2012 campaign , lobbyist @entity126			1
one of his first orders of business was a meeting with @entity130 , the longtime @entity6 political strategist who helped run the two presidential campaigns of @entity132 , never a @entity2 friend when the two served together in the @entity134			1
@entity130 said the get - together , held at his office , was just a chance to connect			0
they talked about his book — and about boiled peanuts			0
" he had his first boiled peanut in my office , " @entity130 said			0
" this is first chance we had to talk			0
he has got a sense of humor and quick wit and twinkle in his eye			0
but we did n't talk about presidential politics			0
we had a nice little chat			0
but he was n't interviewing me , nor was i interviewing him , for any kind of presidential relationship			0
" — @entity2 dropped by the @entity62 state house , where he sat in the gallery and was introduced from the floor by state sen. @entity160			1
@entity2 then met with @entity160 in the @entity134 antechamber , and posed for pictures with other members of the state legislature			2
@entity165 , a @entity62 - based @entity6 who advised @entity2 's 2012 campaign , said the potential candidate is being more methodical about building relationships as he eyes a second bid			1
" i do n't know if @entity2 can capture what he did before , but he is acting more pragmatic this time , " @entity165 said			2
" it 's not as much as a fly - by - night kind of organization like it was before			0
last time he just decided to run and people came along with him			0
now he is laying the groundwork to try to get people on board			0
" — lunch break : @entity2 dined with national and state officials from the @entity185 , an organization of active and retired @entity186			0
the group was in town planning their national convention , which will be held in @entity121 in june			0
— a stop by @entity191 headquarters was next on the agenda			0
@entity2 and @entity126 had a meeting with state party chairman @entity194 , who later tweeted a picture of the " great visit			2
" — @entity126 organized a cozy meet - and - greet for @entity2 at the @entity197 , a private downtown hang - out frequented by @entity62 business and political honchos			1
among those in attendance : @entity87 , attorney general @entity203 , @entity205 @entity62 president @entity204 and @entity206 , a former @entity132 strategist who now steers government relations for the @entity208			0
@entity206 offered @entity2 tickets to that evening 's baseball game against @entity211			2
— at the last minute , @entity2 popped into a private fundraiser for @entity213 , a @entity6 candidate for education superintendent			2
@entity213 , a 36 - year old @entity216 - @entity97 woman , is considered an up - and - comer by some members of the state 's business community who hosted the event , including @entity62 @entity223 president @entity222 , @entity225 president @entity224 , and public affairs strategist @entity226			1
@entity2 met them during his brief drop - by			2
— joined by his niece , an undergraduate at the @entity208 , @entity2 ended the day taking in the college baseball game with other vips inside the president 's box at @entity234			2
over beers , the two talked politics , with @entity206 re-hashing the ups and downs of @entity132 's victorious 2008 primary campaign			0
@entity2 departed after about six innings			0
" he makes a helluva second impression , " he said of @entity2			0
@entity2 : @entity244 gun law to improve safety @entity246 stays quiet on potential 2016 run @entity248 meets with top @entity31 donors 2016 : a more diverse slate of @entity6 presidential possibles			1

former @entity3 @entity6 sen. @entity2 ran for the nomination in 2012 ; might run again
@entity2 is very much keeping his name in the 2016 mix by visiting *critical* early primary states
this time around he 's making early connections with establishment leaders in the early states
