-- @entity2 shoemaker @entity1 is seeing red -- and will likely be seeing a lot more of it -- after a judge in @entity6 denied an injunction that would have kept fellow designer @entity9 from selling shoes with red soles			1
the lawsuit , filed in june , takes issue with four specific shoes from @entity9 's @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity19 models , claiming the shoes violate @entity1 's trademarked " lacquered red sole			1
" " everyone sees the flash of red and associates the red with @entity1 , " attorney @entity22 said thursday about his client			1
in fact , @entity1 's red soles have graced many a red carpets , adorning the feet of celebrities @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			1
in 2009 , @entity36 wrote a song about them , " but it 's the last time , i 'm movin ' on , i 'm throwing on my louboutins			0
" in his decision wednesday , @entity41 district judge @entity40 acknowleded that in choosing a red sole for his shoes , @entity1 had " departed from longstanding conventions and norms of his industry , " to create a product , " so eccentric and striking that it is easily perceived and remembered			1
" however , @entity40 went on to say that , " @entity1 's claim to the ' the color red ' is , without some limitation , overly broad and inconsistent with the scene of trademark registration			1
" " this was a trademark that never should 've been issued , " @entity56 , attorney for the defendant , @entity9 said			1
he adds , " @entity9 has been using red since the 1970s , other designers have used red on the soles of their shoes			1
they are n't doing so to confuse people , but because it 's a design aesthetic			2
" @entity22 thinks the judge went too far			2
" this is no longer about the case , " he said			0
judge @entity40 's decision drew parallels between painters and fashion designers , calling them both members of a creative industry where no one should be barred from using color to achieve their aesthetic			1
doing so could , " interfere with creativity and stifle competition			0
" no designer should be able to monopolize a color			2
" there have been cases when companies have copyrighted color			0
@entity87 , for example , has the trademark for pink fiberglass			0
@entity40 said industrial products are different because the application of color is simply to distinguish one manufacturer from another			0
@entity22 says his client " separated his shoes from everyone else 's by using a red sole			2
" @entity22 said he 's never had such an outpouring from his fellow attorneys , law professors and members of the fashion industry , telling him , " this [ verdict ] is an abomination			0
tell your client to appeal			0
" on august 17 , both sides will meet for a case management conference , and @entity22 says he will announce his plans to do just that			0
" this is not over , " @entity22 said , " not by a long shot			0

judge wo n't stop @entity9 from selling shoes with red soles
designer @entity1 had asked him to do so
attorney says color red is associated with @entity1
but judge said the claim is " overly broad "
