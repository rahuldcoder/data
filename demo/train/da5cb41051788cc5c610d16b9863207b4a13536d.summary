-- a powerful storm system rumbled through @entity2 and other parts of the @entity4 on thursday , spawning a tornado that killed one person and injured others			1
at least seven counties in @entity2 and four in @entity9 suffered damage as storms from the system rolled through and damaged homes and businesses , according to officials in those states			1
@entity18 's emergency management agency also reported trees down in several counties in that state on thursday night			1
this occurred hours after a weak tornado snapped large limbs and caused power outages around @entity26 on @entity28 's @entity27 , according to the @entity29			1
a slew of tornado warnings and watches were issued and , in due time , expired over the course of the day thursday			1
still , some watches -- portending a threat of large hail and damaging wind -- remained in effect through friday morning in parts of @entity18 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity9 and @entity42			1
the area that suffered the most thursday was @entity44 , @entity2 , on the @entity9 border			1
that 's where one person died after strong winds destroyed a steel building along @entity50 , the @entity29 reported			2

across the border in @entity70 , @entity9 , radar indicated a tornado set down and the county emergency management director , @entity73 , said a path of damage had been left behind in the northwestern part of the county , which borders @entity2			1
of course , such hazardous springtime weather is hardly an anomaly in many of these areas			2
a cool march meant that there had been significantly fewer tornadoes this year compared with previous ones , @entity0 's weather unit noted			2
but that does n't mean storms will be less powerful , or that the rest of the season will be slow			1
just ask the people of @entity92 , @entity93 , where at least 24 homes sustained severe damage from storms wednesday night , the @entity90 said			1
is severe weather happening near you ? share your story one tornado touched down in the @entity90 suburb , ripping the roofs off of several homes , @entity100 @entity99 said			1

" what she saw were downed trees and power lines			0
her home was without electricity or water			0
" it looks like a war zone , it does n't look like my home , " she told @entity112			0
@entity107 walked half a mile to an elementary school where the @entity124 had set up			0
after the warning sirens went off wednesday night , @entity125 decided to walk to the back of his house , where he thought he would be safe , but the tornado beat him to it			1
as he was walking through the house , there was a loud pop , then flying glass before he rose off the ground and was thrown on his kitchen floor			0
debris from the ceiling fell , and then it was quiet , he told @entity112			0
" the wind just picked me up and moved me that far across my kitchen , " he said			0
gov. @entity142 declared a state of emergency in @entity93 after the series of storms pummeled the @entity90 area and elsewhere across the state			1
@entity148 was also hard hit , prompting gov. @entity149 to declare 15 counties as state disaster areas			1
the damage in @entity148 included some 15 homes damaged in @entity154 , said state emergency management official @entity155 , and overturned vehicles spotted along @entity158 65 , north of @entity159			1
one tornado touched down in @entity161 , about 75 miles north of @entity162 , damaging at least 33 homes and injuring three people			2
the twister demolished the sanctuary , a fellowship area , classrooms and a pavilion at @entity172 , its pastor said			0
" if the tornado would have come an hour and a half later , we would have been caught in it , " said senior pastor @entity173 , referring to wednesday night services			1
no members of the church were injured			2
but a passing motorist who parked his truck in the church 's covered driveway to get out of the dangerous weather had a close call when the storm struck			2
" it shook the truck and just lifted the roof right off the drive - through , " said @entity173			0
" he was all right			0
" @entity173 , 63 , said his congregation of about 100 was left stunned			2
" it is just devastating			0
my wife and i are just torn , " he said			0
" we put a lot of sweat and hard work and it was paying off			0
" as church leaders prepared to meet with their insurance adjuster , the pastor was thankful for a loyal membership			0
" they will be with me , " he said			0
" they are ready to buckle down and do what we have to			0
with the @entity210 's help , we are going to rebuild			0
" @entity0 's @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 contributed to this report .			0
