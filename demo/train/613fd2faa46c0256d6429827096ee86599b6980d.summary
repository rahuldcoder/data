-- it is as if the air suddenly disappears from the room			1
that is how it feels to lose a big job , one that offers a chance to make a real difference			1
secretary @entity11 resigned friday as the leader of our nation 's @entity13 amid a scandal about wait times at @entity19 hospitals			1
i would never presume to know or imagine his personal frame of mind or feelings right now , but i know a bit about such experiences			1
in 2012 , i abruptly resigned as the administrator of the @entity27 in the swirl of a scandal around excessive spending at the " @entity32 " training conference , as well as dealings with contractors			1
the ensuing uproar was textbook : anxious @entity38 meetings , a scornful media , a pouncing @entity40 and bad optics fueled by silly @entity43 videos			1
it is not an experience that anyone would want to experience ... or repeat			1
i was personally caught in a web of emotions			1
my seven - year relationship with the people of @entity27 was suddenly severed and that saddened me deeply			1
i was troubled by the crude and , yes , bullying politics			1
anxiety swept over me about my finances and prospects			2
my elderly father was deeply upset and needed attention			2
mostly , however , i grieved for the work that i had not completed			2
i believe in the efficacy of work , its ability to give meaning and to offer a central vitality to life			2
to lose my work was utterly painful			2
being a part of a presidential administration was not just an honor to me , it was a real chance to change the world			2
the resources are huge ; the reach and possibilities are vast			1
my hope had been to impact and improve how the government performed -- how it used technology , saved energy , collaborated , improved the work environment for public servants , rebuilt trust , and more			2
instead , i found myself suddenly sitting in my house looking at the dust on the furniture			1
however , it was not quiet for long			2
a lot comes into play in those first weeks after leaving a big job in @entity89			0
my networks went into hyper gear			0
supportive messages , flowers and wine started arriving			0
the @entity95 was in action			0
their calls were such rants that i found myself relinquishing my anger to them			0
they were much better at it			0
others offered me weary wisdom			0
" while i was not ready to hear that prognosis at the time , it turned out to be more than true			0
ultimately , a huge space opened up			1
i had been running at 500 mph while in office , and suddenly i could have a life			0
importantly , i came to the realization that i had been robbed of neither my creativity nor my ability to work			0
the clincher was that i had a partial manuscript for a novel in the bottom of the drawer			0
i pulled it out and set to work			0
within a couple months i published my first novel			0
within a year a second book took shape			0
loss creates an airless vacuum			1
but natural law requires that vacuum to fill again			1
i know that lesson personally			0
from everything i know of @entity11 , he thoroughly understands that law as well			1
may he prosper and thrive in the days and years ahead			0
join us on @entity137 / @entity136 .			0

@entity139 abruptly resigned from the @entity27 in 2012 and feels for @entity11
she went from managing a huge *federal* agency to sitting in her house looking at furniture dust
loss , she says , creates an airless vacuum , but natural law requires that vacuum to fill again
