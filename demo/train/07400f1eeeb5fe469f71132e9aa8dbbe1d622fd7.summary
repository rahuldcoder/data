@entity0 -- the new @entity3 report " @entity14 " documents in excruciating detail the use of torture in government detention facilities in @entity9 , including how , where , when and under whose command this torture was carried out			1
documenting human rights violations in @entity9 is anything but easy , so how did we do it ? since the beginning of anti-government demonstrations in march 2011 , @entity9 has been doing whatever it can to keep independent observers from finding out what exactly is going on			1
for many months , it refused to issue visas for such work , and widespread violations were committed with few independent witnesses			0
some journalists from outside @entity9 bravely crossed the border without official permission , to provide valuable first - hand accounts of attacks and violations			1
but crossing the border illegally can be dangerous			0
several journalists have been arrested and others killed on these assignments , making @entity9 one of the deadliest countries for journalists at the moment			2
news : report describes brutal torture in @entity9 in april of this year , @entity9 finally agreed to the deployment of 300 @entity47 observers and to grant visas to some journalists , but those who got into @entity9 have faced difficulties on the ground			1
when members from the @entity47 observer mission , accompanied by several journalists , tried to investigate claims of a massacre in the small village of @entity59 on june 7 , @entity9 government forces initially prevented them from entering the village			1
when the observers finally entered the village one day later , they saw clear evidence that something terrible had happened			0
journalists on the scene reported that " the smell of burnt flesh still hung heavy in the air " and that " blood was in pools " in a house			0
but somebody had removed the bodies			0
it is hard to not draw the conclusion that government forces held up the @entity47 observers while somebody tried to clean up the crime scene			2
news : in @entity9 , a massacre feels eerily familiar on june 16 , the @entity47 observer mission suspended its patrols in @entity9 because of increased fighting			2
the observer mission had also come under attack on several occasions			0
further complicating the work of impartial observers is the increasing amount of propaganda from both sides			0
we have long since stopped trusting any information coming from the government , but we can not always trust information from opposition activists either			2
some are reluctant , for example , to admit that a victim was an opposition fighter , instead presenting the person as a civilian			0
so how does @entity3 overcome these challenges ? we get the best evidence when we are able to examine the crime scenes ourselves			0
despite significant risks , we have entered @entity9 without official permission on several occasions to investigate alleged violations			2
the last time , in april , we visited five towns that had just been attacked in the northern province of @entity112			0
we photographed bullet marks and blood traces on walls where people had been executed during the army 's attack			0
we interviewed neighbors who had found the bodies , and in one case , we even spoke with a wounded person who had survived an execution attempt			0
but rights - abusing governments can not count on hiding the truth even if they manage to keep observers out			0
@entity9 are still leaving the country in large numbers			2
by comparing information from multiple , separate , detailed witness accounts , we are wresting out the truth despite the best attempts of @entity9 's intelligence agencies			1
" @entity14 " is based on more than 200 long and detailed interviews			1
we asked former inmates of government detention centers not only about the torture , but also about the layout of buildings , the location of the interrogation rooms and torture chambers , and the names of guards and fellow inmates			1
we documented scars and studied photographs			0
we asked former detainees to draw the layout of the detention floor , and we asked them to point out on satellite imagery the exact building where they were detained and tortured			2
we posed the same questions to defectors from the army and intelligence facilities who visited or worked in these facilities , many of whom gave us names and ranks of their superiors overseeing these detention facilities			1
what we found is that @entity9 authorities are running a network of underground detention facilities			1
we have identified the locations , names of commanders , and torture methods of many of these			0
while the actual number is probably higher , the 27 detention facilities listed in our report are those for which multiple witnesses have indicated the same building and described in detail the torture methods being used there			1
by publishing this information , we are putting @entity9 authorities on notice that their crimes will not stay secret			1
it can take time -- it has taken us several months to map these detention facilities -- but with enough perseverance , the truth will come out about the violations taking place in @entity9			1
the question then becomes : who will hold those responsible to account ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			1

@entity201 : report based on more than 200 interviews tells about @entity9 government torture
@entity9 authorities are running a network of underground detention facilities , he says
@entity201 : with this information now public , @entity9 authorities ' crimes will not stay secret
the question now , @entity215 says , is : who will hold those responsible to account ?
