a fire broke out late sunday night on @entity1 in @entity2			1
the fire , which started at about 10:30 p.m. sunday and was contained by 1 a.m. monday , wiped out a crepe shop , an art gallery and a sign shop			1
two firefighters suffered minor injuries , city spokeswoman @entity13 said			2
the fire department was working monday to determine the cause of the blaze , @entity13 said			1

" it became bigger than we thought			0
" we could n't close out checks , and the drinks we made were never served			0
" @entity20 's restaurant reopened monday afternoon , and its adjacent retail store reopened a few hours later , the fire department said			1
in addition to protecting @entity20 , firefighters kept flames away from the historic @entity42 theater , although the facility 's administrator said that a large broken out window and about 2 inches of water on the floor of the lobby would keep it closed for a few days			1
@entity49 said he anticipated the theater would reopen by thursday , in time for a concert scheduled for that evening			0

" it 's a big loss for us			0
and we worked so hard , it 's not fair , " said @entity96 owner @entity95 in a story published on the @entity100 newspaper 's web site monday			0
