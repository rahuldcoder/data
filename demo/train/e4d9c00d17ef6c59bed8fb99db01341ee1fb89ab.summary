as the region 's nations establish themselves as sporting powers , countries such as @entity13 and the @entity14 have pumped millions into sponsoring football clubs			1
a report published by @entity17 states that in 2014 alone , brands from the @entity14 spent $ 163 million on shirt sponsorship deals			1
