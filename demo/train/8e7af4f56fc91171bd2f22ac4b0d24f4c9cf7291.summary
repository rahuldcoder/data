-- my grandchildren and i made history this summer			1
it was our personal history ; our family history			1
we made memories we 'll be able to relive and pass on to others			2
the adventures began when i asked each of my three oldest grandchildren to pick a place he or she wanted to visit and do research on the fun activities the child and i could do there -- just the two of us -- for a week			1
no amusement parks , no fancy hotels ; my finances were limited because of a recent forced retirement , so we would be camping , as well as finding inexpensive or free things to do			2
the location had to be east of the @entity24 and require no more than one overnight stop to get there by car from our starting point , their home near @entity30 , @entity31			2
it turned out only @entity33 , 14 , had enough decision - making experience to pick a spot ( @entity36 -- only slightly west of @entity24 ) , so i talked the possibilities over with the others -- @entity39 , 11 , and @entity40 , 12 -- until we decided on itineraries for their trips			1
10 of @entity44 's best historic restaurants @entity39 chose to go to @entity39 , @entity45 , and @entity46 , @entity47 , doing lots of swimming and sightseeing			2
we included stops at her favorite aunt and uncle 's home in @entity56 along the way			2
@entity40 did not feel strongly about a location , so he joined me at home in @entity61 , @entity62 , and helped me with some cat - sitting duties			1
still , our time together included camping on @entity64 , climbing a sand dune and discovering or rediscovering lots of near and distant relatives			2
@entity33 was decisive about seeing @entity36 , and her research resulted in a whole list of places to go and things to see , all of them affordable			2
we covered everything on her list , plus more			2
i had some concern that traveling with young teens or preteens might be tricky			2
would they talk to me ? would they be bored ? would we enjoy the same activities ? their excitement dispelled any misgivings			2
each one was happy going just about anywhere and eagerly anticipated their own " grandma time			2
" the chance to be special pals for several days overshadowed the importance of the actual destination on both sides , and i never heard one mention of being bored			0
so consider a trip with your young relatives			1
here are some strategies that helped make these summer trips historical -- and smooth -- for us : stock up			1
stopping at the grocery store was always among our first orders of business			0
each grandchild got to select food he or she especially liked , keeping in mind that we would be cooking on my small electric hotplate			0
they were all very considerate of my needs as a vegan and tended to choose food we both could eat			0
we also splurged on simple treats that would withstand the rigors of long car rides and camping			0
the grandchildren controlled the radio , but sometimes we turned it off and just talked to each other			1
@entity40 decided to ask me questions : " what is the most dangerous thing you 've ever done ? " or , " where would you go if you could go anywhere in the world ? " after i answered , often with a story about his father as a child or my adventures living in @entity139 , i would turn the question on him , and he would regale me with his own dreams and adventures			1
7 - million - mile family shares travel secrets join in			1
memories were made when i actually got in the water , climbed the hill , let the birds land on me and generally participated first - hand in what my grandchildren were enjoying			1
watching them play or taking pictures was nice , but something great happened when we were able to splash , race and float together			0
simple things were often the most memorable things			0
a ride on the trolley car , meeting new relatives , preparing a meal together and hearing one another 's personal stories were the things that the kids talked about long after the trip was over			1
the limits on spending did n't deter them , either			0
some of our best times were spent having dessert in an all - night coffee shop , holding a live chicken for the first time , finding an airport with the same name as @entity39 , admiring the architecture in the @entity179 , naming rocks discovered on the beach at @entity64 and watching @entity182 go nuts when the directions did not get us to where we wanted to go			1
we asked : your travel planning philosophy rest			0
down time was some of the best time			0
after a day of being on the go , a trip to the grocery store , a few minutes watching tv together , a swim in the pool or some other quiet activity were often ideal times to relive the fun of the day , plan the next outing or find that one more thing we had in common			1
@entity33 cooking me dinner at the campsite , using shrimp we had bought in the @entity179 , was one of those low - key evenings that proved to be a high point			1
planning for each trip was essential , but some of the best opportunities to make history together came when we least expected them			1
case in point : we ran into my sister at the local library and discovered that her grandson was visiting			0
our two grandsons ended up spending the night together camping on my balcony and having their own adventures			0
are you a window flier or an aisle seater ? share decision - making			1
each grandchild was at a different level of maturity regarding making choices , but as their week progressed , i saw each one grow in their ability to come up with wonderful ideas , to be considerate of the needs of both of us and to choose among good options			0
it was a surprise to me that at 11 and 12 , @entity39 and @entity40 each had a real adjustment to make being away from home , without parents or siblings to look to			0
@entity247 brought along a framed picture of her parents , which helped her feel more secure			0
my cell phone served as a lifeline for both children , as well as for @entity253 , who was suffering a little separation anxiety herself			0
each day the children grew in their independence , and the phone calls got fewer and shorter as our time together stretched on			0
to continue sharing our stories after the week was over , i purchased inexpensive thumb drives for each grandchild and saved all the pictures from their trip on their own drive			1
this way , we both would have copies of all the pictures			0
the day after we returned home , @entity33 posted all of her 497 pictures on her @entity274 page			0
one of the experience 's unexpected blessings came when i was able to stay for a few days with the whole family after each trip			1
this gave me a chance to hear the stories of our trips from my grandchildren 's perspectives			1
the extra bonus : i am now the " fun grandma			0
