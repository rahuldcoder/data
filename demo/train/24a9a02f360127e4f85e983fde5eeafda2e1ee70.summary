-- it was supposed to be one of the happiest days of @entity4 's life			1
he had just secured funding for the home he was building and was traveling along @entity7 outside @entity8 , @entity9 , one sunday with his wife and child			1
that 's when he first heard the sirens			0
" we were not doing anything illegal , we were obeying the speed limits , " @entity14 told @entity0			0
" it 's just a normal routine stop , i thought			0
" a state trooper pulled the family suv over to the side of the road			0
even though his pregnant wife was driving , @entity14 said , the officer focused on him , discovering a warrant for his arrest			0
the alleged crime , he said , was an unpaid traffic fine			1
the 35 - year - old @entity32 resident was arrested , handcuffed , and hauled off to the @entity33			1
that began what he called a " six - day nightmare			1
" @entity14 was strip - searched by corrections staff , all because of what he terms a misunderstanding , a computer glitch			1
" it was very disgusting			0
it was just a bad , bad experience , " he told @entity0 correspondent @entity44 recently			0
" i was just told , ' do as you 're told			0
' wash in this disgusting soap and obey the directions of the officer who was instructing me to turn around , lift my genitals up , turn around , and squat			0
" still shaken by the experience six years later , @entity14 sued , and now his appeal is before the @entity56 @entity55			1
he is challenging the county 's rules allowing routine strip searches of everyone arrested for even minor offenses , regardless of the circumstances			1
it is an important test of police detention powers in the post- 9/11 security - conscious environment , a chance for the justices to offer clarity on an issue in which both inmates and the police have sought guidance			1
oral arguments are scheduled for wednesday			0
court records show @entity14 was subjected to what he terms an invasive strip and visual body - cavity search			1
he was then held for nearly a week in the county lockup before being transferred to a @entity83 correctional facility , where he was subjected to another search before being placed in the general prison population			0
the next day a judge freed @entity14 , confirming what he had insisted all along , that the fine had been paid			1
the state argues the " intake search " for new prisoners was applied fairly , and applied to everyone			0
" at the time mr. @entity4 was admitted into the facility , the policy and the practice were to ask him to take off his clothes , take a shower and be subject to a visual search , " said @entity94 , who will argue @entity33 's side of the case before the high court			1
" his allegation is that they went further than that , and that 's obviously a disputed matter at this point			0
" the case has yet to go to trial , pending outcome of the constitutional issues now before the high court			0
the justices will decide whether corrections officials should have a less intrusive , " reasonable suspicion " standard that would prevent the kind of search currently permitted in at least 32 states , including @entity9			1
" where the counties went wrong is , they 're doing a blanket policy of strip - searching anyone that comes in that jail or the prison			1
so basically , your constitutional rights stop at the prison door , " said @entity126 , @entity14 's @entity127 - based attorney			2
" it 's a balance -- what are you brought in there for ? for failing to pay a fine ? or for murder ? you know , failing to pay a fine does not justify strip - searching you			1
" but the counties counter by saying that kind of individualized scrutiny does not work in such a controlled environment , when so many new inmates need to be initially processed			2
" the basic purpose , obviously , is to avoid the risk of contraband or weapons or anything else being smuggled into the jail , and so therefore , it protects not only the guards , but also protects all of the other inmates , " @entity94 told @entity0			2
" the question is : do you have a reasonable expectation of certain kinds of privacy ? and it seems to me when you are being lawfully admitted into a prison facility , and he was , at that point , your expectations of privacy essentially drop to zero and the importance of maintaining security rises to about 100 percent			0
so the balance , it seems to me , clearly favors the prison			0
" @entity14 also points out his alleged offense , failure to pay a fine , is not considered a criminal offense in the state and would not normally result in incarceration			2
his family said their efforts to free @entity14 were thwarted by repeated bureaucratic run - arounds			2
state officials draw a distinction between a strip - search policy for those newly admitted and for those later entering the general prison population			1
such initial searches are justified , said the state , when applied for proper reasons , including potential health threats			0
federal courts since the september 11 , 2001 , attacks had been at odds over the constitutionality of strip searches			2
the @entity196 's @entity195 protects against " unreasonable searches and seizures			0
" the @entity55 in 1979 , in what is called the @entity201 precedent , upheld a search similar to the ones @entity14 had undergone for those prisoners who had contact visits with outsiders			1
using a balancing test , the justices said the prison 's security interest justified intrusion into the inmates ' privacy			2
but subsequent appeals courts have found those arrested for minor offenses may not be strip - searched unless authorities have a " reasonable suspicion " that the person may be concealing a weapon or contraband such as drugs			1
in 2008 , however , appeals courts in @entity221 and @entity222 found searches of every inmate coming into a prison population are justified , even without specific suspicions			0
those opinions were the first of their kind since the 9/11 attacks and , along with @entity14 's case , now give the high court the chance to clarify an issue that a number of civil and human rights proponents have tried to highlight			2
local jails in @entity9 at the time of @entity14 's arrest were subject to federal monitors after allegations that minority motorists and their passengers were being unfairly targeted for police stops and arrests			1
stops of that nature are not at issue in the current appeal			2
@entity14 , who is african - american , is not alleging any racial discrimination by the state or individual officers			2
the case is @entity255 of the @entity256 , @entity9 ( 10 - 945 )			1
a ruling can be expected early next year .			0

@entity4 , *mistakenly* arrested for an unpaid traffic fine , was strip - searched
he has filed suit again @entity33 , @entity9 , for his " six - day nightmare "
both inmates and police are *hoping* the @entity55 will offer clarity on the issue
