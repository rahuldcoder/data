@entity0 -- an @entity3 soldier faces a manslaughter charge in the death of a @entity7 waving a white flag during a three - week incursion into @entity10 , the @entity3 military said tuesday			1
the criminal indictment is one of three legal actions taken by the @entity3 military for incidents that occurred during @entity15			2
more than 1,100 @entity7 died during the operation , which began late in 2008 and ended early in 2009			2
it was intended to halt the firing of missiles from @entity10 into @entity3			2
the manslaughter charge was filed after an investigation into the shooting , the @entity20 said in a news release			0
" this decision is based on evidence that the soldier , who was serving as a designated marksman , deliberately targeted an individual walking with a group of people waving a white flag without being ordered or authorized to do so , " the @entity20 said			1
conflict between the testimonies of @entity7 witnesses and military personnel made it " impossible to make a criminal connection " between this incident and an incident described by those @entity7 witnesses in which @entity3 soldiers allegedly fired at people waving white flags , the @entity20 said			1
in another incident , a battalion commander authorized sending a @entity7 man into a house sheltering terrorists next to his own house in order to persuade them to leave , the news release said			1
the commander was indicted " because he deviated from authorized and appropriate @entity20 behavior " and ignored rules on the use of civilians in military operations , it said			1
but the release did not appear to say what charges he faces , and the @entity20 did not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking clarification			0
tuesday 's news release also said a criminal investigation has been ordered into an incident in which a residence holding about 100 members of a family was struck from the air			0
in a separate case , an investigation into an assertion that the @entity76 mosque had been attacked concluded that that did not happen , but that an aerial strike near the mosque had occurred			0
" the aerial strike targeted a terror operative involved in the launching of rockets toward @entity3 who was standing outside of the mosque , " the news release said			0
" injuries caused to civilians inside were unintentional and caused by shrapnel that penetrated the mosque			0
" but the investigation concluded that the officer who ordered the attack had " failed to exercise appropriate judgment " and , as a result , will not be allowed to serve in similar positions of command			0
legal measures were deemed unnecessary , however			0
" the military advocate general decided that the attack did not violate international laws of warfare because the attack did not target the mosque , rather it targeted a terror operative , and when the attack was authorized , no possibility of harming civilians was identified , " it said			0
@entity3 investigators looked into more than 150 reports and conducted nearly 50 probes of incidents during @entity15			1
earlier this year , the @entity3 military disciplined two officers -- a brigadier general and a colonel -- for allowing artillery shells to be fired into a populated area of @entity10			0
but @entity7 said @entity3 's actions were unsatisfactory			1
" i think @entity3 should take all responsibility for all the war crimes that it is responsible for during its unjustified war in @entity10 , and what they just announced is too little too late , " @entity7 spokesman @entity118 told @entity1			1
the @entity20 news release said that @entity3 carried out the operation after enduring eight years of rocket attacks from @entity10			1
@entity3 , it said , had " practiced a policy of restraint for a long period of time			0
" it accused the @entity7 movement @entity132 of terrorizing the population and said the crowded urban centers of @entity10 created a complex security situation			0
more than 1,400 @entity7 died in @entity3 's incursion , according to officials in @entity10			1
the @entity3 military said 1,166 people were killed , 60 percent of whom were " terror operatives			2
" the 575 - page @entity141 report -- approved by the @entity142 in 2009 -- accused both @entity3 and @entity132 of " actions amounting to war crimes , possibly crimes against humanity " during the three - week offensive that ended in january 2009			1
the report , known for its author , @entity151 jurist @entity149 , called on both @entity3 and @entity132 to independently investigate the alleged human rights violations cited in the report .			2

evidence indicates that a @entity7 waving white flag was shot and killed
a battalion commander was indicted in a separate incident
@entity3 @entity20 looked into more than 150 incidents involving rules of engagement
a @entity142 - *backed* report urged probes into possible crimes against humanity
