@entity1 the @entity0 is here and countries throughout @entity5 are celebrating			1
but should we be ushering in the @entity7 ? it depends , says @entity9 , who teaches @entity11 mythology at the @entity12			1
" the @entity11 character yang can be translated as all of these animals -- even the gazelle is called yang in @entity11 , " he says			1
a wander through @entity1 's streets and shopping malls yields few definitive clues			2
store windows are decked out with cartoon - like sheep , cheeky goats and curly - horned rams in a marketing bonanza some say is bigger than @entity27 in the @entity28			2
" i 'd be more inclined to translate it as goat for the simple reason if you look at the way the character yang is written , even in its ancient form , you can see that there is a pair of horns so it more closely resembles a goat than a sheep , " says @entity9			1
both sheep and goats are raised in @entity11 , but the former are only found in the grasslands on the country 's northern fringes			1
the ram -- a male sheep -- is a third candidate , preferred by some who do n't like the meek , docile characteristics associated with the sheep			2
other places are clear which zodiac animal they are celebrating			0
in @entity58 , where the celebration is known as @entity60 , they are ringing in the @entity61			0
money changers in the country say they have struck up an unlikely trade in @entity65 and @entity67 banknotes -- both feature goats -- and they have been changing hands at several times the official exchange rate as people clamor for something more unusual to stuff inside their lucky envelopes			0
whereas in @entity76 , people have been busy dressing up their pets in sheep outfits and sending sheep - themed @entity80 postcards to mark 2015			0
in @entity11 , the annual mass migration for @entity0 , as the celebration is often called there , is taking place , with 2.8 billion trips expected as the country heads home or on vacation for the festive period			1
of course , the confusion over the choice of animal is unlikely to dampen the festivities , which stretch for two weeks or more , and few @entity11 are troubled by the @entity96 speaking world 's sheep / goat distinction , at least according to @entity11 's official news agency			2
" i 've never thought about that question before			0
do we have to tell them apart ? " @entity102 , an office clerk in @entity103 , was quoted by @entity104 as saying			0
" i 've seen more goats in zodiac images , but i prefer to buy a sheep mascot , as sheep are more fluffy and lovely , " he says .			0

the @entity0 , which *begins* *february* *19* , is celebrated throughout @entity5
but should we be ushering in the @entity7 ?
it depends on how you translate the @entity11 word " yang " , says mythology expert
