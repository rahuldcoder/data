-- while the world 's attention has been focused on tumult in the @entity7 world , @entity2 has cracked down with impunity on dissent and is feared to come down even harder as elections approach , @entity1 said in a sweeping report			1
the global human rights monitor documented " widespread and persistent human rights violations in @entity2			1
" " it is essential if further mass human rights violations are to be avoided that the international community act on behalf of the hundreds , if not thousands , of prisoners of conscience and political prisoners imprisoned after unfair trials in @entity2 , " @entity1 said in the report			1
supreme leader ayatollah @entity23 celebrated the popular revolts in @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 , saying that they reflected an " @entity30 awakening " based on @entity2 's 1979 revolution			0
but since the 2009 election , the @entity30 republic has repressed similar voices within its own borders , @entity1 said			0
" since the 2009 crackdown , the authorities have steadily cranked up repression in law and practice , and tightened their grip on the media , " according to the @entity1 report , which came out just hours after the @entity45 @entity44 convened for its latest session in @entity47			1
" in @entity2 today , you put yourself at risk if you do anything that might fall outside the increasingly narrow confines of what the authorities deem socially or politically acceptable , " said @entity48 , of @entity1 's @entity49 and @entity51 program			2
" anything from setting up a social group on the @entity60 , forming or joining an @entity61 or expressing your opposition to the status quo can land you in prison , " she said			0
@entity2 has defended its record before the @entity45 @entity44 and charged that @entity67 critics are politicizing the issue of human rights for their own gain			1
yet @entity1 said @entity2 has deemed demonstrations , public debate and the formation of groups and associations a threat to " national security " punishable by long prison sentences or even death			2
" lawyers have been jailed along with their clients			0
foreign satellite television channels have been jammed			0
newspapers have been banned , " the advocacy group said			2
@entity85 , wife of detained journalist @entity86 , describes in the report how an interrogator told her husband , " we are ordered to crush you			1
and if you do not cooperate , we can do anything we want with you			0
and if you do not write the interrogation papers , we will force you to eat them			0
" @entity1 said blogger @entity96 was this month sentenced to four and a half years in prison followed by 10 years in " internal exile , " plus sentenced to pay a fine on charges believed to include " spreading propaganda against the system , " " gathering and colluding against national security " and " insulting officials			0
" @entity1 called on the world to pressure @entity2 to amend laws that restrict rights of expression and assembly , as well as to allow for public debate before @entity2 cast their votes in march			2
it also called for an end to jail time for people who protest peacefully and independent investigations of alleged human rights violations			0
the issue of human rights , said @entity1 , can get lost as the international community scrutinizes @entity2 's nuclear program			1
" for @entity2 facing this level of repression , it can be dispiriting that discussions about their country in diplomatic circles can seem to focus mainly on the nuclear program at the expense of human rights , " @entity122 said .			1

a new @entity1 report documents what is described as repression in @entity2
the human rights advocacy group urges the international community to take action
" we are ordered to crush you , " one interrogator told a detainee , according to the report
things may get worse with elections around the corner , @entity1 says
