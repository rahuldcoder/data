-- there will be no contract deal monday night between @entity4 public school officials and the city 's teacher 's union , city school board president @entity8 said			1
mayor @entity11 's spokeswoman , @entity10 , said talks were continuing late monday , though @entity8 said by then that he 'd left the negotiating session for the night			1
" we said to them again , ' we should resolve this tomorrow , we are close enough , ' " @entity8 said			1
" this is hard work			0
we want to get this resolved			0
we want our kids back in school			2
" the failure to produce a breakthrough comes a day after the @entity23 called a strike as school officials said they had nothing more to offer			1
the union has not stated , as of late monday night , if the city 's first teachers strike in 25 years will continue into a second day tuesday in the absence of a deal			1
the strike left about 350,000 students with an unscheduled day off , and left some parents scrambling for alternatives			2
police , expecting an uptick in trouble with more kids on the streets , pulled officers from desk duty to increase patrols due to the strike			2
dozens of churches and civic organizations stepped in to provide activities for thousands of suddenly idle students , while the school district opened 144 of its 578 schools for part of the day to provide a safe environment and meals to children in need			1
many children going to these in - school programs had to pass picket lines , as their teachers chanted , held signs and otherwise made their opinions heard			1
@entity63 , father of a student at @entity65 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity66 he " was not happy " about the commotion and tension , which he said he unnerved his children			2
" i would not want to keep my children here unnecessarily , so i 'm taking them back home , " said @entity71 , another father of children at the same school in the city 's @entity75 neighborhood			1
the union that represents nearly 30,000 teachers and support staff in the nation 's third - largest school district called the strike after negotiators failed to reach a contract agreement with school administrators despite eight months of talks			1
the union said they were close sunday night to a deal on pay , but far apart on teacher evaluations , benefits and other issues			1
opinion : whole world is watching @entity4 mayor @entity11 said teachers were harming @entity4 's children by striking			1
" this is , in my view , a strike of choice , and it 's the wrong choice for our children , " he said			1
" stay at the table			0
finish it for our children			2
" he said negotiators had resolved all but two issues -- teacher evaluations and provisions dealing with jobs for laid - off teachers			2
however , @entity23 president @entity116 said teachers had no choice but to strike , despite " intense but productive " bargaining sessions			1
the primary disagreement appears to be teacher job security in the wake of a new program that evaluates teachers based on students ' standardized test scores			2
@entity23 board member @entity127 called the idea " data - driven madness			0
" as many as 6,000 teachers could lose their jobs under the evaluation system , according to @entity133 , who called the system " unacceptable			0
" the mayor 's office , the city of @entity4 , and school officials have questioned that job loss figure			1
voices of the strike " this is no way to measure the effectiveness of an educator , " @entity133 said sunday			0
" further , there are too many factors beyond our control which impact how well some students perform on standardized tests such as poverty , exposure to violence , homelessness , hunger and other social issues beyond our control			0
" another sticking point is a " recall " policy that would put laid - off teachers in line for job openings at other schools within the district			0
@entity11 said such a policy , supported by the union , would take hiring decisions away from school principals and put them in the hands of central administrators and union leaders			1
" direction and dictation should not come out of downtown , " the mayor said			0
teachers also want to block changes to their health benefits and win concessions on classroom conditions			0
pay is also an issue			0
however , the union said the two sides are close to a pay agreement after school officials offered to increase salaries 16 % over four years on average for most teachers			1
the average teacher salary in @entity4 was $ 74,839 for the 2011 - 2012 school year , according to the district			1
in addition to the pay raise , the school system 's offer includes paid maternity leave and short - term disability coverage			2
it would also freeze health care cost increases for two - thirds of the union 's membership			2
the high school day would also be shortened slightly , and teachers would be limited to teaching five classes , the district said			2
the district 's existing proposal would cost $ 400 million over four years , according to school board president @entity8			1
key issues in @entity216 strike @entity4 schools ca n't afford more concessions , @entity8 said			1
" we have no more flexibility when it comes to finance , " he told @entity0 on monday			0
at a midday news conference , @entity11 called the plan on the table an " honest compromise that respects our teachers , does right by our kids and is fair to our taxpayers			0
" @entity23 officials have said they are puzzled by the stance of @entity11 , the city 's @entity232 mayor , whom they accused of going back on promises to teachers , police officers and other civil servants , according to @entity127 , the union board member			1
" he has definitely been a huge disappointment , " @entity127 said			0
" he has disrespected virtually every middle - class person in this city			0
" sen. @entity242 , @entity243 , urged a quick resolution			0
" both sides need to get back to the table as quickly as possible and really stay in there , negotiate through the night if necessary , " he said monday			0
" get it over with quickly so that we can get these kids back in school			0
" read more about teacher unions on @entity0 's @entity254 blog about 50,000 @entity4 students who attend charter schools are unaffected by the strike and will remain in class			1
but that still leaves the vast majority of students , whose parents were encouraged by the school district to " explore other options for their children " as long as the strike continues			1
" we know that a strike will put a strain on many families , and no one will be hurt more by a strike than our students , " the district said on its website			0
one of the organizations opening doors for students during the strike is @entity280 , which has a free program for part of the day for students in grades six through 12			0
" in collaboration with core performance artists and special guests , young people will see the power of their voices in action through film , performance and discussion , " the group said			0
still , some parents were concerned about what would happen to their children during the strike			2
" if the kids are not in school , they 're out getting into some kind of trouble ... when they should be in school , learning , " said @entity299 , a mother of two children in kindergarten and first grade who opposes the teachers ' decision to strike			1
" i think they should be in school getting an education			0
" are you there ? share your images and videos			0
@entity0 's @entity318 , @entity319 , @entity320 and @entity321 contributed to this report .			0
