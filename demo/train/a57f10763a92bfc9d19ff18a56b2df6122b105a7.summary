@entity0 , @entity1 -- the confirmation of five cholera cases in @entity1 's capital is a " very worrying development , " a @entity4 spokeswoman told @entity2			1
public health officials are working to keep the country 's cholera outbreak from spreading in @entity0 , @entity1 , where tens of thousands of people are still living in sprawling tent cities after january 's devastating 7.0 - magnitude earthquake			1
the fast - moving outbreak has claimed at least 253 lives on the impoverished island nation , and another 3,015 cases have been reported , according to @entity1 's health ministry			1
@entity0 could still be safe			1
the five patients were infected north of the capital , and those confirmed cases do not mean cholera has spread to @entity0 , @entity24 , spokeswoman for the @entity4 @entity26 in @entity1 , told @entity2			1
" our response system worked , but obviously this is a very worrying development , " she said			0
the five patients in @entity0 were infected in @entity31 , north of the capital , @entity24 said			1
they traveled to the nation 's main city , where health officials discovered them to be infected within the incubation period , she said			0
the five have been isolated and are receiving treatment , she said			0
but meanwhile , officials are stepping up sanitation efforts and setting up quarantine areas in @entity0			1
and authorities are bracing themselves for a possible larger outbreak nationwide			1
" i think the only responsible thing we can do at the moment is prepare and plan for the worst case scenario , " @entity24 said			0
@entity24 said aid organizations are working on constructing facilities to treat patients and sending more doctors to the affected areas			0
" we 're all right for supplies ... but we 're short on medical personnel , " she said			0
the cholera outbreak comes after recent heavy rains caused the banks of the @entity60 to overflow and flood the area			1
the river was dammed in 1956 to create @entity63 and is @entity1 's dominant drainage system			1
on friday , officials with the @entity66 , and the @entity67 discussed the outbreak and efforts to work out a containment strategy			2
the @entity66 will send an 11 - member team to @entity1 over the next few days to find out which antibiotics will be most effective in treating the cholera outbreak			1
@entity67 will provide supplies needed to set up treatment centers			0
the group has already prepositioned 300,000 oral re-hydration kits and are distributing water purification kits in affected areas			0
cholera is caused by a bacterial infection of the intestine and , in severe cases , is characterized by diarrhea , vomiting and leg cramps , according to the @entity66			2
in such cases , rapid loss of body fluids can lead to dehydration and shock			2
" without treatment , death can occur within hours , " the agency says			2
a person can get cholera by drinking water or eating food contaminated with the bacteria			2
during epidemics , the source of the contamination is often the feces of an infected person , and infections can spread rapidly in areas where there is poor sewage treatment and a lack of clean drinking water			0
all the reported cases in the @entity31 involve severe diarrhea and vomiting , @entity24 said			0
@entity114 , director of @entity115 near @entity116 , said patients began showing cholera - like symptoms on october 16			0
the pace picked up significantly tuesday and beyond , though he said the situation was under control friday at his 80 - bed facility about 16 miles east of @entity124			0
" so far , we 've been able to manage it , " @entity114 said , noting that new patients were now coming in via pick - up trucks about every 10 minutes			0
temperatures in the mid- 90s exacerbated the dual concerns about dehydration and people contracting cholera by drinking tainted water			2
people lined roadsides in and around villages with buckets , hoping that passersby might have clean water , said @entity140 , @entity1 's national director for the nonprofit @entity141			1
the @entity4 mission in @entity1 credited access to clean water and free medical facilities for preventing feared outbreaks of cholera and tuberculosis			1
@entity2 's @entity149 contributed to this report .			0
