-- i was scrolling through family photos on my computer , admiring my two beautiful babies , when i spotted a disturbing trend : my laptop was open in almost all of the pictures			0
there 's my daughter , at 8 months , playing at my feet while i typed away on the couch			0
there 's me and my son , a year later , with the laptop at my side as i held him in my arms			0
i 'd heard about internet addiction before , but always assumed it was something limited to socially challenged guys who played too much @entity21			1
now it seemed my @entity24 " habit " was slowly but surely crossing the line			1
sometimes i found myself up into the wee hours of the morning , surfing the web while my family slept			0
i read the news , kept up with friends , and looked up answers to endless questions			0
i wrote my personal blog and read dozens of others , just for something to do			0
it turns out i 'm not the only mama who plugs in and zones out			0
@entity38 , coordinator of resource development at the @entity40 in @entity41 , says that she 's seeing more and more women coming in for internet addiction			1
they 're young , they 're often new mothers , and they 're addicted to blogs , message boards , and @entity48 , she says			1
these moms are contributing to a growing global addiction			1
there 's a movement among psychiatrists to recognize internet addiction as an official mental disorder ( just like alcohol dependency )			1
and a recent @entity58 national survey found that 14 percent of internet users find it hard to stay away from it for several days at a time ; 9 percent try to hide their " nonessential internet use " from their loved ones ; 8 percent admit they use the web as a way to escape problems			1
you 're likely not the kind of addict that @entity38 has seen -- women who do n't bathe and abuse drugs to help them stay " up " for more online time			1
you may have noticed , though , that going online has become an imposing part of your life , which , at the least , means a load or two of laundry goes unwashed ( and who cares about that ? )			1
but it may also mean you 're missing out on time with your baby -- something you probably do care about			1
here , why we 're so susceptible as new moms to that blue glow of the screen			1
' i feel like i 'm going crazy ' @entity93 's son @entity92 was born prematurely and released from the hospital under the condition that @entity93 keep him at home for two months without any visitors			1
since her husband works long hours , @entity93 was alone most of the day			0
" when my husband got home from work , i was clingy and dying for someone to talk to			0
i started to feel like a crazy person			1
i was becoming depressed without any interaction , " she says			0
parenting : when postpartum depression lasts desperate , she went online and found the community she needed			1
" i 'd talk to people in chat rooms for hours			0
" but not about babies or parenting			0
" i needed to feel like a normal person who could have normal conversations that were n't about breastfeeding or how many ounces my son gained			2
" soon , she was spending as many as eight hours online every day			2
" in addiction treatment , we talk about the fact that there 's a void , " says @entity38			2
" whatever that void may be -- whether it 's emotional , spiritual , physical -- typically , we 're trying to fill it			2
" for many new moms , she says , that void is the isolation -- both the tangible isolation of being home alone with a demanding newborn and the mental isolation of diving into uncharted waters -- they often experience during the transition to parenthood			2
" being a mom of young children can be very solitary , " agrees @entity139 , cofounder of @entity24 / @entity140 in @entity141 , @entity142			1
so it 's easy for them to turn online , he explains , to find other parents and create a world there where they are not alone			2
once that world is created , it becomes an escape that moms may turn to whenever they 're stressed , lonely , bored , or sad			1
in addiction , they become dependent on that escape			1
parenting : ways to beat new - mom stress " i called it my ' avoidance cycle , ' " says @entity159 ( her name has been changed ) , a pregnant mother of three from @entity161 who used to write four blogs			1
" whenever i felt overwhelmed , i would escape into mindless web surfing			2
i 'd find myself circling through the comments section on my blogs to my photos on @entity169 to see if anyone had commented on them , and then over to @entity172 to see if anyone was chatting with me there			2
i 'd waste hours just waiting for someone to respond to something i 'd said or posted			0
" because she 'd skip errands and allow her kids to make a mess of the house , she says , her stress only amplified , and she 'd dive into the avoidance cycle all over again			0
and even now that @entity93 's son is a healthy 5 months and allowed to socialize , she still finds it hard to resist the @entity185			0
" today , i had to unplug my computer so i would n't go online , " she says			2
" i probably spend the same amount of time online as i did when it was all i could do			2
" ' i can be a different person ' if it were just an escape that moms were looking for , however , they could flip on the tv or pick up a book			1
but according to a recent @entity198 poll , more than double the number of moms choose the computer over books or the boob tube during their babies ' naps , showing that they 're looking for something more than an escape : connection , yes , but also a way to express themselves			1
after giving birth , says @entity38 , many women feel like they 've given up their identity to the all - consuming role of " mother			1
" " it 's another sense of loss common in new moms , " she says			2
flirting with ex-boyfriends on @entity218 or buying a handbag online may remind us of the people we used to be -- the working woman , the woman who had time for art projects , the woman who wore skirts and lipstick			2
" i 'm just a mother in real life , but online , i can be a whole person , " says @entity226 , a mom of 2 - year - old twins from @entity228 , of her four - hour - a - day online habit			1
on virtual - living sites like @entity48 , where users create avatars , moms can become anyone from a leather - wearing motorcycle chick to a college cheerleader			1
in moderation , trying on different personas can be healthy , assures @entity38			0
it becomes problematic when the online identity becomes so appealing that you neglect your real - life role			1
parenting : moms ' dirty little secrets " my husband feels like i do n't spend enough time with him , " says @entity247			2
" he says that every time he 's home and can watch the girls , i dash online			2
" ' i have so much to do ! ' @entity254 , you can pay bills , order diapers , upload photos , and look up possible causes of your kid 's constipation			0
in fact , you can almost accomplish too much online			2
" ticking items off a to - do list is intoxicating when you feel like you do n't have much control over other parts of your life , " says @entity139 ( and what 's more uncontrollable than life with a newborn ? )			1
@entity272 , mom of a 7 - month - old in @entity273 , knows the feeling			0
" i started following coupon sites and became so engrossed in finding deals that i neglected the important things , like time with my son , for a while			0
" after the @entity24 , real life can seem , well , unproductive			1
" when i play with my boys , i feel like i should be getting something done , " says one mom of 18 - month - old twins in @entity284			1
" i almost get antsy just hanging out with them , and i take regular breaks to check my e-mail , respond to a @entity218 friend request , or order photos from @entity292			0
i 'm addicted to online errands			1
" parenting : getting over new - mom guilt going off - line think you might be hooked ? try keeping a journal of how often you go online for a week			1
then assess what you 're missing out on when you do it -- sleep , family time , work ? also note in your journal what was going on each time you decided to sit down at the computer			1
was it right after a fight with your husband ? were you bored ? by figuring out the triggers that send you seeking refuge online , @entity38 says , you can come up with alternative activities that help you deal			0
if you 're stressed , for example , you might take your baby out for a walk			0
@entity38 also suggests making small weekly goals that get you involved with the real world : join a playgroup or grab coffee with a friend			0
and if you ca n't control your habit on your own , talk to a therapist who deals with addiction			0
parenting : eight ways to be a happier mom as for me ? i quit blogging after six years and am working hard to meet new people			0
@entity159 is doing the same			0
" getting off - line has helped stop the flood of mama guilt i had all the time			0
i still have guilt over different stuff , but at least now i do n't have to lie in bed and think about all of the times my kids wanted something and i shooed them away because i was absorbed in my @entity341			0
