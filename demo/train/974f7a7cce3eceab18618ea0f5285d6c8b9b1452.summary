in an intensive care unit in @entity2 , a virus ravages the body of a 7 - year - old who 's in heart and kidney failure			2
he vomits blood several times an hour as his family gathers in vigil			2
in a cabinet in @entity13 , @entity14 , there 's a drug that could likely help @entity16 , but the drug company wo n't give it to him			1
they 're adamant that spending the time to help @entity16 and others like him will slow down their efforts to get this drug on the market			1
helping @entity16 , they say , means hurting others			1
when asked how he will feel if @entity16 dies -- and he 's in critical condition , so sadly that could happen soon -- the president of the company that makes the drug does n't hesitate to answer			1
" horrible , " said @entity31			0
he would feel horrible and heartbroken			0
but still , he said there 's no way he 's going to change his mind			2
there 's no way he 's going to give @entity16 this drug			1
' we 're begging them ' it 's called " compassionate use , " but sometimes it feels anything but compassionate			1
here 's the way it works : according to the @entity50 , if someone has a serious or immediately life - threatening disease and has tried and failed other available treatments , they can ask a drug company for an experimental drug , one that they 're still studying and has not yet been approved by the @entity50			1
companies often say yes : the @entity50 approved 974 compassionate use arrangements in fiscal year 2013			0
in cancer drug battle , both sides appeal to ethics but pharmaceutical companies often say no , as they did to @entity16			1
" our son will die without this drug , " said @entity61 , @entity16 's father			1
" we 're begging them to give it to us			0
" so now , like many families , the @entity67 have turned to the media , @entity70 , and @entity71 to pressure the drug company to change its mind			1
countless members of " @entity16 's army " have responded with angry tweets to @ chimerix , telling them to " open their hearts , " asking the executives how they can sleep at night			1
" everyone is watching , " one tweeter warned the company			2
others have tweeted out the e-mail addresses of the company 's board members			1
@entity90 executives say they 've received physical threats			0
@entity31 , the company president , has read these tweets and said he is heartbroken , but the issue is complex and unsuitable for a 144 - long character debate			1
at its very simplest , this is it : @entity90 is going full speed ahead to get the drug on the market hopefully by the end of 2016 , and if they spend time and money on compassionate use cases , it would greatly hinder their effort to get the drug , brincidofovir , on the market and available to everyone			1
the company would have to dish out $ 50,000 per compassionate - use patient , since insurance does n't usually pay for experimental drugs , @entity31 said			2
and perhaps even more important than the money , it would divert manpower in this 50 - person company , since they 'd have to handle the requests and then get the patient 's records and follow up with them , as required by the @entity50			1
" if this were just one patient wanting this drug , then this would be a very different question , " he said			0
" but it 's yes to all or no to all			0
" from 2009 to 2012 , the company did give out the drug under compassionate use to 451 patients , @entity31 said , but at least at that time , the information gleaned from those 451 compassionate use patients was helpful to the @entity90 study and helped move the science along			1
but currently doctors do n't really learn very much , if anything , from compassionate use patients , so the patients do n't help get the drug to market			1
beat cancer four times @entity16 's journey began when he was diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer at 9 months old			1
over the years , cancer turned up in his thymus , lung , and bone marrow , and each time @entity16 beat it			1
but a bone marrow transplant left @entity16 without much of an immune system , and in february doctors diagnosed him with an adenovirus that spread through his body			1
they gave him an antiviral drug , an intravenous form of brincidofovir , but it ravaged his kidneys			0
his doctors at @entity161 said not to give up hope			2
since they 'd been part of the brincidofovir studies , they 'd seen how in sometimes just a week or two , the the oral form of the drug could get rid of an adenovirus without damaging the kidneys			0
now all they had to do was ask the company that makes brincidofovir : @entity172 on february 12 , the @entity161 's doctors called a @entity90 executive , dr. @entity174 , and asked for permission to use brincidofovir			1
she said no. on march 5 , the doctors asked again			0
two days later they got an answer by e-mail from another executive , dr. @entity180 , who said the company was not " in a position to provide drug for this and other subjects in similar circumstances due to a limited inventory and our limited resources			2
" ' he holds our son 's life in his hands ' @entity31 wants you to know that he has children of his own , and if his child had an aggressive adenovirus like @entity16 , he 'd be doing the same thing as @entity61 and @entity199			1
" there are no words to express our compassion for this young boy and his family and what they 're going through , " he said			0
@entity206 , a bioethicist at @entity207 , said he feels for both the @entity67 and for @entity31			0
" we ca n't ask the company to turn into a philanthropy or their investors will back out , " he said			0
it 's not just the $ 50,000 per patient that might make investors squeamish , @entity206 said , but compassionate cases can make a drug look bad			2
by definition , compassionate use patients are extremely sick , and might not do well with the drug			0
companies have to report that poor outcome to the @entity50 in its application to market the drug			2
perhaps there 's another way to handle compassionate use requests , @entity206 suggests			0
perhaps a company like @entity90 could agree to give the drug only to the very most dire cases , and put a cap on the number of patients they help			2
" they might want to open the door a little more broadly , " he said			0
" they might want to show a little compassion			0
" but right now , @entity90 stands firm that their compassionate use program is almost completely over			0
" we 've had employees who ask for the drug for family members who are close to death , and the answer has been no , " said @entity180 , the @entity90 executive			2
but that 's not good enough for the @entity67			0
" he holds our son 's life in his hands , " @entity61 said			0
" this is just beyond belief to me			0
" @entity258 printer helps save dying baby			0

@entity16 is in critical condition at @entity161
there is a drug that may help him , but the drug company is *refusing*
the company 's president says he has kids too and feels for @entity16 's family
helping @entity16 and others like him could slow efforts to get the drug on the market
