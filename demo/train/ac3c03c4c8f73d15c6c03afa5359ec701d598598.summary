" women are @entity2 's most underutilized resource			1
" @entity3 said @entity2 's prime minister @entity4 in april as he outlined a raft of measures aimed at closing the gender gap in the @entity2 workforce			1
as a @entity11 journalist new to @entity2 , it is a shock that it takes an economic argument to move the government to act toward more female participation in the workforce			2
but it 's not just a foreign perspective			2
the noted economist @entity18 writes in the @entity19 this week , " you secure better working conditions for women because they have a rightful claim to such treatment			0
no other reasoning or justification is necessary to do something that is decent and just			0
" nevertheless , if you are a prime minister in urgent search of growth , the numbers behind so - called " womenomics " in @entity2 are compelling			1
' if you were to close the employment gap between @entity2 men , which is 80 % , one of the highest in the @entity39 , with @entity2 women -- which is still around 60 % -- we estimate that you 'd add about 8.2 million workers into the @entity2 workforce , " says @entity33 of @entity34 , who has long championed the cause			1
that influx of female workers " could lift the asset level of @entity2 gdp by as much as 14 % , " she adds			1
now prime minister @entity4 is trying to force corporations to act			1
he has set targets of at least one female executive per company and offered tax incentives to companies that encourage mothers to return to work			0
despite equal employment opportunities enshrined into law in 1986 , real equality within most domestic @entity2 companies remains within the realm of fantasy - land			2
@entity63 had worked for 10 years with an it company but was demoted to a starting position when she came back after the birth of her first child			0
" women who choose not to have a child would continue up the corporate ladder while those who did would be forced into semi-retirement , " she says			2
she did n't expect flexibility from the company 's side though			0
" once one exception is allowed , other mothers would complain they were n't treated in the same way , " she says			0
according to @entity34 , some 70 % of @entity2 women choose to leave the workforce after they 've had children			1
that 's more than twice the number in the @entity83 or @entity84			0
but unlike the @entity83 and @entity84 -- where childcare is cited as the major factor for why women leave work -- in @entity2 , uncompromising work environments , which demand face - time and offer little career mobility for women , persuade most mothers to give up corporate life			1
a 2011 study by the @entity93 called " @entity94 and on - ramps japan : keeping @entity101 " found that three quarters of @entity2 women want to rejoin the workforce after they 've had children , but only 43 % manage to get their careers back on track			1
those who do return to work tend to take salary cuts and often find themselves , like @entity63 , marginalized within the company			0
cosmetics giant @entity106 does better than most			0
since 1990 its childcare support program has been in continual evolution , providing employees with extensive leaves of parental absence , shorter working hours , childcare subsidies and on - site nursery facilities			0
it is also working on a gender equality action plan to boost its ratio of female leaders though it admits it will miss its slated target of 30 % by end 2013			2
@entity120 , executive director of human resources at @entity106 , describes the management style in the past as " very slow moving			0
" even though @entity106 is an example of corporate best practice in @entity2 , @entity120 admits there is still some way to go along the road towards true daibashitii , the @entity2 word for diversity			2
" the female leader ratio in @entity2 @entity134 , representing 25,000 employees is still 25.6 % whereas female leader ratio overseas where we have 20,000 employees is almost 60 % , " @entity120 says			2
@entity140 joined @entity106 in 1989			0
she met her husband there and they have two children			0
she feels grateful to the company for continuing to support and promote her throughout			0
" i think i was fortunate with this company because they did not assume we women would quit after childbirth and they educated us so we 'd continue to work , " she says			0
@entity2 's bleak demographic outlook is well known			1
the birth - rate is shrinking , the population is getting older and there are fewer workers ' to pay for the nation 's pensioners			1
the @entity159 forecasts @entity2 's population will shrink by around 30 % by 2055			1
@entity4 's push to make the workplace a more hospitable place for women -- quite apart from the argument that it 's just more fair -- is also a matter of economic survival			1
whether @entity2 's male corporate bosses are listening remains to be seen .			1

@entity2 is pushing measures to close the gender gap in the nation 's workforce
prime minister @entity4 : " women are @entity2 's most underutilized resource "
@entity2 women face strong *cultural* pressure to leave the workforce after having a child
*analyst* : workforce parity " could lift the asset level of @entity2 gdp by as much as 14 % "
