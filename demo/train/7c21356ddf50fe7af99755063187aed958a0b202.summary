@entity0 , @entity1 -- give @entity3 a date , and he can usually tell you not only what he was doing but what world events happened that day			1
he can do this for almost every day of his life			2
@entity3 has hyperthymestic syndrome , experts say , and remembers what he did on allmost every day of his life			1
@entity3 is one of only three people in the world identified with this off - the - charts autobiographical memory , according to researchers at the @entity17 who gave the condition its name : hyperthymestic syndrome , from the @entity22 words for excessive ( hyper ) and remembering ( thymesis )			1
unlike most people whose memories fade with time , much of @entity3 ' life is etched indelibly in his mind			2
" it 's just there , " said @entity3 , 51 , who reports the news for a family of radio stations in @entity0 , @entity1			1
the @entity35 researchers are studying @entity3 and the two others with hyperthymestic syndrome , a man in @entity39 and woman in @entity35 , hoping to gain new insights into how a superior memory works			1
the goal of the study is to find a way to help people with failing memory			1
@entity3 did n't realize how exceptional his memory was until his brother @entity49 told him about an article published two years ago in the journal @entity52 , describing a woman referred to by the initials , @entity53 " my brother in @entity35 saw this and said , ' she sounds like you			1
why do n't we talk to the folks at @entity61 ? ' " @entity3 said			2
at @entity61 , researchers quizzed @entity3 , as they have the two other hyperthymestics , about a series of dates , asking for the corresponding event , and vice-versa			1
" the speed with which they do this is part of why i find this so amazing because it seems to indicate there 's no -- or not much -- intentional calculation going on			0
it 's boom , boom , boom , there 's the answer , " said @entity74 , a fellow at the university 's @entity75			0
" remember , these are questions they had no idea what we 're going to ask them			0
" now researchers are using an mri to create three - dimensional pictures of the hyperthymestic brain			1
they want to see whether any brain structures differ in size , compared with the average brain			0
@entity74 and his colleagues are still going over the results but it appears some structures in the prefrontal cortex are substantially larger in hyperthymestics			0
the prefrontal cortex sits at the front of the brain and has been associated with complex thinking , not learning or memory			1
@entity74 said he hoped others with this extraordinary ability will come forward			2
" i hope that we can identify as many of these people as possible because the more we identify and the more we study the greater the likelihood that we are going to really figure out fundamental new things about brains and memory that we would have never figured out without them , " @entity74 said			1
flipping through a family photo album with him it was astonishing how much @entity3 recalled , going back decades			2
asked about one black and white picture taken in the @entity119 of @entity120 , he remembered exactly when it was taken : tuesday , july 28 , 1964 , the same day as a trip to @entity123			0
he also remembered that the temperature reached 100 degrees and that they tried to keep @entity127 drinks cool in a @entity128 in the back of the car			0
@entity74 said @entity3 and the other hyperthymestics do n't do any better than average on standard memory tests , nor are they savants , a condition where one extraordinary mental ability is accompanied by deficits in other areas			1
in this age of instant information , what can you do with phenomenal recall ? " i do n't really know			0
i 've thought about it for years , " said @entity3 , the 1969 @entity144 champion			0
@entity3 appeared on " @entity146 ! " but finished second			0
for now , @entity3 said he is content knowing research into his memory might help others			2
" that would be the ultimate goal			0
" @entity152 is a senior producer with @entity153 .			0

@entity1 man has extraordinary memory known as hyperthymestic syndrome
he remembers *specific* dates , days of week , events from decades ago
researchers hope to gain new insights into how a superior memory works
