the @entity1 - led @entity0 approved a resolution on wednesday authorizing speaker @entity3 to sue president @entity4 over claims he abused his powers at the expense of @entity8 and the @entity9			1
the vote was 225 - 201			2
@entity1 argue @entity4 's executive orders in a number of areas were unlawful because it 's the job of @entity8 to make or change laws			1
but they believe his handling of the @entity17 gives them the best chance at proving their case , and are basing the suit on that issue			0
@entity0 authorization now allows gop - leaders to have the unusual challenge filed in federal court			0
the time frame for that is not clear and many legal experts question whether any judge would take it on			0
not a single @entity0 @entity32 voted for the resolution and five republicans opposed it			0
they were : @entity1 members @entity37 of @entity38 , @entity39 of @entity40 , @entity41 of @entity42 , @entity43 of @entity44 , and @entity45 of @entity46			0
the vote takes partisan rancor in @entity49 to a new level less than four months before congressional midterms with control of the @entity53 at stake			0
the focus on @entity17 also magnifies politics around the sweeping health law @entity1 did n't support and have tried to derail since its approval in 2010			1
it also illustrates @entity4 's attempts to act on his own with he and @entity8 getting nowhere on top - shelf legislative initiatives			1
dems claim impeachment coming @entity65 quickly seized to turn the debate on the lawsuit , saying prior to the vote that the real desire of the @entity1 is to ultimately impeach @entity4			1
@entity3 , who has repeatedly said he disagrees with those pushing impeachment , attempted to shut down that discussion this week			1
insisting that @entity1 have " no plans " and " no future plans " to impeach @entity4 , @entity3 denounced the talk of it as " a scam started by @entity65 at the @entity0			1
" but @entity65 seized on polls showing a majority of @entity80 oppose any effort to remove the president from office , and are n't letting go of the issue			2
@entity87 @entity86 said the lawsuit was " on a path to nowhere or maybe among some in your ranks , a path to impeachment			0
" apparently not satisfied with @entity3 's assurance , @entity86 directed this at him : " if you do n't want to hear people use the word impeachment , as your people have done , then tell them impeachment is off the table			2
" @entity104 poll on suit , impeachment @entity4 tweaks @entity1 on impeachment @entity4 , himself , tweaked @entity1 on wednesday			1
in @entity109 , @entity110 , he noted the @entity0 was about to leave @entity49 for the month of august , but " the main vote that they have scheduled for today is whether or not they decide to sue me for doing my job			0
" during debate , @entity65 lined up on their side of the chamber and one after the other requested that @entity1 leaders allow votes on measures to raise the minimum wage , extend jobless benefits , and ensure pay equity			1
they knew @entity1 would n't hold off on the lawsuit to take any of those issues up , but the the theater was designed to underscore their argument that the majority party was focused on the lawsuit rather than legislating			0
the campaign arm for @entity0 @entity65 arm has raised $ 7.6 million from appeals to supporters citing the suit and tied it to the threat of impeachment			1
rep. @entity139 , chairman of the @entity140 , defended the aggressive public push and pledged @entity65 would continue it through the midterm election in november			0
" you bet we 're going to run on a @entity8 that is just obsessed with lawsuits , suing the president , talking about impeaching him , instead of solutions for the middle class , " @entity144 told @entity104			2
@entity80 do n't like suit , impeachment a @entity104 / @entity154 poll released last week showed those @entity80 surveyed , by a 57 % -41 % margin , opposed the lawsuit			0
nearly two - thirds said @entity4 should not be impeached			2
@entity44 @entity1 @entity158 responded to @entity140 refrains that the resolution was the first step toward impeachment			2
he said the @entity0 voted in 1998 to impeach @entity165 because " he lied to an @entity167 agent , he lied to a federal grand jury , and he violated the federal law which was a felony			0
" but in @entity4 's case , @entity1 believe he is n't " faithfully executing the laws , " which he has sworn to do , and " that is an entirely different process			1
" @entity172 @entity1 @entity171 , chairman of the @entity0 @entity1 's political operation , said " impeachment is not on table			2
" and he issued a warning to fellow @entity1 at a meeting , saying that any time the @entity1 raised the issue it only helped @entity65			1
the @entity17 focus when @entity3 announced last month that he would sue @entity4 , he followed a course many tea party members and conservatives had urged for months			1
they were especially angered by actions @entity4 took without consulting @entity8 to change or delay key @entity17 provisions , to allow children of undocumented immigrants to stay in the country , and to release @entity190 prisoners from @entity80 custody in exchange for @entity196 war prisoner @entity194 sgt. @entity193			1
initially , @entity3 indicated the @entity0 would sue over @entity4 's decision last summer to delay for a year a central health law requirement for businesses provide health coverage to their employees			1
the @entity0 voted to do the same thing last july , but republicans argued they did so to protect the integrity of @entity8 in the face of what they believed was executive overreach			1
after consulting legal experts , the @entity0 resolution was tweaked to give @entity3 more flexibility			0
it specified that the suit can cite the administration 's implementation of any provision of @entity17			0
the @entity0 's office of general counsel will represent the @entity0 in court and the resolution gives it the authority to hire outside lawyers to finalize the legal strategy and file a formal complaint			0
many constitutional experts have raised doubts that the courts will take up the case			0
the legal burden will be on the @entity0 to present how it was damaged as an institution by the president 's actions			0
analysis : @entity4 impeachment talk just political theater			2

they say the president is violating the law by circumventing @entity8
@entity65 say the suit is just a primer for a @entity1 - led impeachment of @entity4
speaker @entity3 says there are no impeachment plans ; @entity65 raising money off it
