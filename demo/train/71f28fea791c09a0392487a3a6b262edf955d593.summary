-- one smiles for the camera , another appears defiant , while a third looks serene			2
they all look straight into the camera			2
their confessions are blunt and candid -- it 's a relatively new strategy used by @entity9 authorities			1
under pressure to show results from a nationwide offensive against organized crime , the @entity9 government has been releasing videos of high - profile interrogations			1
most of the subjects are suspected drug lords who have been recently captured and are in jail awaiting trial			1
the new approach comes nearly five years into president @entity23 's term			2
by some estimates , more than 40,000 people have died since he took office in december 2006 and launched the drug offensive			1
as his strategy has become unpopular with many in @entity9 , his administration has been pressured to respond to the criticism and show the results of his efforts : more than 20 of the country 's 37 most - wanted criminals killed or captured since march 2009			1
@entity37 , also known as " @entity38 , " is a reputed co-founder and co-leader of the @entity9 drug cartel known as " @entity41			1
" in his video interrogation , he explains what kind of men his cartel recruited as operatives			2
" ( we would choose ) young men who did n't do drugs , who had a good profile , and who were good to the full extent of the word , that did things right , and who did n't kidnap people , " @entity47 says			0
@entity41 announced its creation in 2006 in the @entity9 state of @entity61 by tossing five severed human heads onto a dance floor			1
@entity64 , also known as " @entity65 , " was the reputed leader of " @entity64 , " a gang of enforcers for the @entity68 in the @entity9 state of @entity70			1
in his video interrogation , he admits that he was the mastermind of an attack against federal police officers using a car bomb			2
" we kidnapped an individual who belonged to the @entity75 ; we killed him , and dressed him with a local police uniform			0
he was thrown at an intersection right next to a vehicle with explosives and somebody activated the explosives remotely with a cell phone , " @entity77 said			0
he also says he gave the order to kill @entity86 consular employee @entity85 and her husband , @entity87 , as well as 15 young people at a house party in @entity9 's murder capital , @entity91 , just across the border from @entity93 , @entity94			1
" since they were all minors , there was a lot of commotion , and , yes , honestly , some of them were innocent , " @entity77 says			0
@entity101 , aka " @entity102 , " was a former @entity103 officer who allegedly deserted to join the cartel known as " @entity105			0
" he admits he owned as many as five so - called " narco tanks " or " monsters , " custom - made armored trucks with swiveling turrets and reinforced steel battering rams			0
in a revealing moment , he tells his interrogator the thing that he regrets the most			0
" is there anybody you would want to ask for forgiveness ? i mean , for your actions , for what you did , if you failed somebody , your children , your family ? " his interrogator asks			0
@entity123 responds : " oh , my mother			0
because of this i have n't seen her in about 17 years			0
... it 's hard ... it 's cruel , but that 's the way it is			0
" despite the offensive , however , violence has continued unabated as the remaining drug cartel leaders fight turf and succession wars , especially in such border states as @entity70 and @entity135 that have traditionally been transit points for drug shipments headed for the @entity86 .			1
