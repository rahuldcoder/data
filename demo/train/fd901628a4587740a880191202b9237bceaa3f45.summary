-- last weekend , a dark cloud hung over the box office after the tragedy in @entity4 , @entity5 , rocked the country			1
the " @entity12 " still managed a stunning $ 160.9 million opening weekend — the third best of all time — but most believe it could have finished with substantially more money had audiences not been avoiding the theater			1
there 's definitely still some tension in the air this frame , but movie going is expected to return at least somewhat back to normal			0
two new openers are hitting theaters — sci - fi comedy " @entity22 " and dance sequel " @entity23 " — but they wo n't be any match for the second weekend of " @entity12			1
" here 's how the box office may play out : once again , @entity12 will top the chart			1
the question is how hard it will fall in its sophomore frame			0
in 2008 , @entity29 dropped 53 percent to $ 75.2 million in its second weekend , but rises will be lucky to earn a similar drop			1
after six days in theaters , " rises " is lagging behind " @entity29 " ( $ 211.8 million vs. $ 222.2 million ) despite a stronger start			1
on its first monday , tuesday , and wednesday , " @entity29 " earned $ 24.5 million , $ 20.9 million , and $ 18.4 million , respectively			1
rises , meanwhile , earned $ 19.4 million , $ 17.8 million , and $ 13.8 million			1
i see four possible reasons for this slighter performance : the shooting still has moviegoers wary to attend the theater — especially for " @entity12			1
" " @entity12 , " while well - received , is not earning the same amount of feverishly strong word - of - mouth that propelled " @entity29 " into the box office stratosphere			2
" @entity12 " is playing like a typical sequel			2
they open bigger ( in this case , only slightly bigger ) , but then fall much more quickly due to up - front fan excitement			0
@entity50 collectively underestimated just how big of a box office bump @entity53 's death gave " @entity29			0
" that film 's numbers were misleadingly inflated , and " @entity12 " was never destined to be a bigger box office powerhouse			1
whatever the reason , " rises " does n't seem to be holding up quite as strong as " @entity29			0
" thus , i 'm thinking a drop in the 60 percent range is in store for @entity65 ' $ 250 million @entity64 sequel			2
@entity12 may gross $ 65 million over the friday to sunday period , which would lift its total right around $ 290 million			1
@entity69 's comedy " @entity22 , " which once looked like a surefire hit , will likely invade second place with much less business than most prognosticators would have guessed six months ago			2
the film , which stars @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , and @entity78 , tells the story of a volunteer police squad who seek to protect their neighborhood , but end up fighting off an alien invasion			0
the film , which was made for $ 68 million , has faced numerous marketing challenges due to controversial news events			1
originally titled @entity22 , it got a modified title after the february shooting of @entity90 by @entity92 resident @entity91 , a volunteer neighborhood watch officer			2
@entity69 was forced to play up the alien angle of the film instead of the regular - guys - shooting - guns storyline			0
the studio had largely kept any images of alien invasion out of their advertising after @entity100 and " @entity104 's " back - to - back flops , which had studios hesitant to associate themselves with intergalactic creatures			0
despite the new tack , " @entity22 " never fully shook the association with the @entity90 scandal , and the @entity4 shootings have n't helped in that department			2
whether many regular moviegoers actually make these connections is unlikely			0
still , these factors have consistently affected @entity22 's marketing campaign , and as a result , it 's been difficult for @entity69 to clearly communicate the story			2
despite poor reviews , the movie features a three high - profile comedians in a year that 's been kind to broad comedies			0
playing in 3,168 theaters , " @entity22 " may gross $ 22 million			1
the other new release is " @entity23 , " the fourth installment of the popular dance franchise , which recently shifted from @entity125 to @entity126			0
the $ 33 million sequel comes two years after " @entity128 , " which earned $ 42.4 million , substantially less than its predecessor , " @entity131 , " which grossed $ $ 58 million			2
the diminishing returns may continue for " revolution , " as the franchise seems to be teetering dangerously close to the quality level of long - running direct - to - video spinoff series like bring it on and @entity138			0
popping and locking into 2,567 theaters , @entity133 could finish in the same range as 2004 dance flick you got served , which started with $ 16 million			2
" @entity143 " has the benefit of @entity146 screens , but those are only major box office boons for blockbusters these days			0
( if only the series still starred @entity150 ! ) it may earn about $ 13 million this weekend — but the real money will come internationally			1
" @entity128 " grossed $ 161 million worldwide			0
rounding out the @entity155 will be @entity156 , which may earn about $ 13 million in its third weekend , and then either @entity157 or @entity158 , both of which should finish with about $ 6.5 million			1
@entity12 -- $ 65 million 2			1
@entity22 -- $ 22 million 3			1
@entity23 -- $ 13 million 4			0
ice age : @entity160 -- $ 13 million 5			0
@entity158 -- $ 6.5 million see full story at @entity0			0
