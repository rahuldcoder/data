a senior @entity1 journalist quit his role earlier this month , saying the " mishandling " by his bosses of a story critical of @entity5 was behind his departure , amid suggestions that the @entity10 - based company is pushing a financial strategy for @entity5 that overshadows editorial autonomy			1
@entity15 editor - at - large @entity13 left the news organization at the beginning of march in protest at his senior colleagues ' approach toward a long - running investigative piece that sought to expose hidden financial ties between the families of @entity5 officials and a wealthy businessman			1
the @entity27 , amongst others , first covered the story of the piece 's non-publishing in november of last year			0
in an email to the newspaper , quoted in the initial article , @entity1 editor - in - chief @entity34 said the piece was " active " and that it had not been killed			1
however , since then it has remained unpublished and , speaking to @entity37 thursday , @entity13 said that , while what he can say is limited by a confidentiality agreement , he could " categorically state that it ( the story ) was spiked			2
" " no work is currently being done on that story , " he said			0
" the primary reporter has left the company ... it 's a risible excuse to say that the story is just resting			2
" despite requests on a number of occasions , @entity47 declined to comment on this story when contacted by @entity37 , or agree to requests for an interview with @entity34			0
' misleading statements ' the piece , which was produced over several months in 2013 , was due to be published late last year but " ran into some opposition " from senior staff , according to @entity13			0
the initial @entity27 article cited journalists who worked on the story and participated in a conference call as saying @entity34 informed them that a decision not to publish the story had been made			0
@entity34 reportedly told the journalists -- @entity13 included -- working on the story that it was necessary to stay on the right side of @entity5 officials , given that several reporters from organizations including @entity71 and the @entity27 along with @entity1 , had had their visas withheld or rejected -- apparently following reports critical of @entity74			1
subsequently , the story 's lead journalist , @entity75 , left the company			0
@entity75 declined to comment when contacted by @entity37			0
in an email to media blog @entity79 , published earlier this week , @entity13 wrote : " i left @entity1 because of the way the story was mishandled , and because of how the company made misleading statements in the global press and senior executives disparaged the team that worked so hard to execute an incredibly demanding story			1
" the reporters who worked on the story for months did n't get to review the copy before it was unilaterally spiked on a conference call with a ludicrous amount of top brass			1
" unlike many news organizations , @entity1 has alternate revenue streams			1
@entity47 , @entity1 ' parent company 's financial terminals are sold in @entity5			1
currently , the number of subscribers in the country , estimated by the @entity102 blog at 3,000 , is dwarfed by those in other parts of the world , meaning that there is considerable scope for growth			0
when asked about the subscriber numbers , a @entity1 spokesperson told @entity37 that the company could not confirm subscriber numbers for individual territories			2
the timely , accurate access to @entity5 financial data is also considered to be an important part of the company 's success , enhancing its legitimacy as a provider of financial data worldwide			1
backing off ? comments made by @entity1 chairman @entity123 following his @entity126 @entity125 speech on march 20 , addressed the issue of sensitive stories in @entity5 and their ramifications			1
" we have about 50 journalists in the market ( in @entity5 ) , primarily writing stories about the local business and economic environment and ... every once in a while we wander a little bit away from that and write stories that ( we ) probably ... should have rethought but @entity5 for us is very important , " he said in response to an open - ended question about the company 's strategy there			2
" for us being in @entity5 is very much part of our long term strategy and will continue to be so going forward			0
" @entity148 , director of the @entity149 of the @entity150 , said she thinks the message @entity123 's statement gives is that " @entity1 is willing to compromise the credibility of its news product			2
" " i think it 's problematic , and wrong for him to pitch business with journalism , with data , because you need good reporting to ensure ... ( the ) authenticity of your information			0
i do n't understand ... you 're not selling apples and oranges , you 're selling information to the world			0
then credibility is your most valuable attribute , right ? so you need a product that 's credible , ( or ) you undermine yourself			0
" for @entity13 , the decision to publish or not comes down to @entity1 's view of itself as a journalistic organization , and where its priorities lie			2
" the company has a duty to consider the interests of a majority of its workers			0
now if your news division is part of that ( but ) does n't provide the bulk of the revenue ... if you 're putting the company 's entire business at risk because of an investigative journalists ' project , then you have to ask yourself -- is that the right thing to do ? " the company 's signature financial software product is by far its biggest revenue producer , representing about 82 % of its $ 8.5 billion in revenue , @entity123 said during his @entity126 speech			2
timeline : foreign journalists under pressure in @entity5 sensitive stories @entity1 has sailed close to the wind on previous occasions , such as former editor @entity207 's june 2012 piece on then - incoming president @entity210 's family 's business interests and its " @entity221 " story , also edited by @entity13 , which mapped the origins of an " elite class " of descendants of @entity5 's " @entity216 " -- an elite group of @entity219 revolutionaries who helped found the @entity5			1
since the publication of that article , @entity1 's news website has been blocked in @entity5			1
@entity13 said that the story represented a new direction for the company but ultimately @entity47 may have felt they have underestimated the severity of the reaction of @entity5 's political class			1
" i do n't know to what extent that ( was ) born out of naivety , " @entity13 said			2
" did they really realize what the consequences were ? anyway , i would think they probably would have rethought it with hindsight			0
" reporters playing smart as @entity5 takes tough line with media @entity5 's influence the news of @entity1 's alleged climbdown comes as part of a larger trend of international companies acquiescing to @entity5 's restrictions			1
while @entity251 giants @entity250 and @entity252 have chosen to remain outside of @entity5 rather than compromise their independence , others , such as @entity256 , @entity257 and @entity258 have accepted that curtailment is a condition of doing business in @entity5			0
in addition , in 2005 and 2006 @entity262 suffered a wave of negative publicity for handing over data on journalist @entity267 to the authorities			0
at the time , a @entity262 spokesperson told @entity270 that the company 's response was that they had " only responded with what we were legally compelled to provide and nothing more			0
" in the last two years , international media companies , including @entity71 , @entity1 , the @entity27 and @entity277 have fallen afoul of @entity5 authorities , prompting a slew of comment from publications such as the @entity282 and the @entity10 about the cost of reporting in @entity5			1
in its 2013 year - end statement , the @entity284 of @entity5 said that @entity5 authorities were increasingly using the denial of visas , or delays in their approval , in an apparent effort to influence journalists ' coverage			1
@entity5 authorities did not respond to requests from @entity37 for comment on this story			1
with regards to @entity1 's possible editorial decisions , " the interesting thing is whether a news organization , per se , has a duty to protect and enhance free speech , " said @entity13			1
" i think that the debate we should be having is not trying to treat @entity1 as some kind of fallen angel but just to try another debate as to how the media engages with dictatorial regimes or this level of intolerance to free speech			0
" @entity314 journalists ' @entity5 visa dramas : do n't shoot the messenger			2

@entity1 editor - at - large @entity13 leaves company , saying " top brass " mishandled sensitive story
news organization claims the story was n't ready for publication , a claim *disputed* by @entity13
sales of terminals in @entity5 and access to @entity5 financial data may influence editorial decisions
move follows other international news organizations running afoul of @entity5 authorities
