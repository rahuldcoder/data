@entity0 , @entity1 -- a panel of judges monday sentenced former @entity1 prime minister @entity5 to seven years in prison for abusing power and having sex with an underage prostitute			1
judges also barred the flamboyant former prime minister from holding public office			1
the high - profile case centered on an exotic dancer nicknamed " ruby the heart - stealer			0
" @entity5 's attorney told reporters he plans to appeal the conviction			1
he said he was not surprised by the verdict , because the former prime minister had not gotten a fair trial			1
" what happened today is very serious , " defense attorney @entity22 said , arguing that judges had not appropriately considered court proceedings			2
prosecutors had argued that @entity5 had sex 13 times with underage dancer @entity29 and abused his position when he intervened in may 2010 to get her released from jail , where she was being held on charges of theft			1
@entity5 , 76 , has denied the charges and others against him			2
" it is absurd to suggest i have paid for a rapport with a woman			0
it is something i have never done , not even once in my life			0
it is something i find degrading to my dignity , " he has said			0
@entity44 has said that she never had sex with @entity5 and that she lied to him about her age , telling him she was 24			2
the underage sex trial verdict is the latest in a string of legal troubles the former prime minister has faced			1
last month , an @entity1 appeals court in @entity0 upheld a four - year prison sentence for @entity5 , who was convicted of tax evasion by a lower court last october			1
in that sentence , he was barred from public office for five years			1
@entity5 , who served on and off as prime minister between 1994 and 2011 , is arguably one of the most colorful and controversial figures in the lively history of @entity1 politics			1
for years , he has been entangled in fraud , corruption and sex scandals that have often reached @entity1 courts			0
@entity65 in a 389 - page document presented to a court in 2011 , prosecutors alleged @entity5 paid @entity69 and scores of other young women for taking part in " bunga bunga parties " at his private residence			2
using what they say are phone interceptions of the young women as evidence , prosecutors said the women performed stripteases and erotic actions in exchange for money and gifts			0
@entity5 says the parties were normal dinner gatherings where no one misbehaved			0
@entity5 denied the charges and accused prosecutors of conspiring against him in a left - wing plot			0
" @entity92 never changes in @entity1			0
there are still people who use the penal code as a weapon in their ideological battles , " he said last year			0
undaunted , @entity5 has not only launched an appeal , but in december made two significant announcements : his engagement to 27 - year - old @entity101 , and then , his political comeback			2
in @entity1 's february elections , the three - time prime minister appealed to @entity1 voters by denouncing the unpopular austerity policies of technocrat @entity107			2
for all his critics , @entity5 won almost 30 % of the vote in february and remains an influential figure in prime minister @entity112 's fragile coalition government			1
@entity2 's @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 contributed to this report .			0
