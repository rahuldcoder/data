@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 live with noise			1
funnel - shaped loudspeakers mounted atop houses of worship blare before dawn			1
painting a big " @entity16 " sign on the rear bumpers of trucks , buses and vans muscling their way down the country 's clogged roadways is common now			0
giant generators roar in neighborhoods during power outages			0
residents bear the crackle of machines from factories that might be operating clandestinely in officially non-commercial areas			2
rarely is a celebration -- religious or social -- held without loud music			0
but @entity1 policy - makers have prepared what they call a road map aimed at controlling pervasive noise			1
and one of the latest steps they have taken is to give comfort to citizens at bedtime			0
they have defined night in legal terms			2
" the nighttime has been defined ( 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. ) and restrictions have been imposed on the use of horns , sound - emitting construction equipments and bursting of firecrackers during nighttime , " the federal environment ministry said			1
it also outlined what constitutes a public place and limits sound amplification from such locations			2
residents will have to keep their music below new limits , as set by amendments to the nation 's noise rules , the ministry said			1
@entity1 officials also announced noise - monitoring stations in major cities , including @entity0 , @entity61 and @entity62 , by september			1
eighteen more cities will join the system by 2011 , the ministry said			2
" with the new system in place , a systematic national level monitoring and reporting network in the country will be available , as in case of air and water pollution			0
" environmentalists welcome the moves			0
nevertheless , they see enforcement as a big challenge -- and awareness even bigger			0
@entity80 , an expert at the nonprofit @entity81 in @entity0 , said noise violations occur despite existing laws and court orders			1
" people have to develop self - discipline and authorities the capacity to monitor noise and enforce the laws to contain its high levels across the country , " @entity80 said			1
