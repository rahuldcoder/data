-- to all of you gun lovers , feel free to go buy your @entity3 , shotgun , hunting rifle , .22 pistol , @entity7 or any of the other guns at your disposal			1
but you do not need an @entity11			1
for some , it 's too soon to discuss gun reform , a little more than one week after the mass killings in @entity15 , @entity16			2
too many @entity18 are being killed by guns every day ; this most recent heinous tragedy should not keep us from having a rational debate			0
let me be crystal clear : i do not own a gun , have no desire to get one and do n't begrudge anyone for having one			1
keeping a gun for safety ? no problem			2
you 're a hunter ? knock yourself out			0
i 've fired a submachine gun once -- at the @entity34 in @entity35 -- and it did nothing for me , so please , carry on			1
i absolutely and positively support the @entity37			0
@entity18 have the right to bear arms , but nowhere in the @entity40 does it say that you must be able to bear any arms your heart desires			1
opinion : media ca n't ignore the killer there is no reason the ban on assault weapons is no longer the law of the land			2
if you need an @entity11 to hunt , maybe you need shooting lessons			1
president @entity54 was right when he told the @entity55 last week that " ak - 47s belong in the hands of soldiers ... not on the streets of our cities			1
" the inability of the @entity63 to understand that is shameful and destructive			1
the group assumes that any reasonable restriction on guns is un-american and unnecessary			2
well , it 's wrong			0
opinion : three who gave their lives and the @entity63 is just as wrong when it opposes efforts to restrict drum magazines that can hold 100 rounds , such as the one the gunman in @entity16 used to mow down moviegoers			1
seriously , please offer me a reasonable and rational explanation as to why someone who is n't a law enforcement officer needs to fire off that many bullets ? this is where common sense makes a ton of sense			1
yes , people are the ones pulling the trigger , but our gun culture borders on the truly obsessive			0
gun deaths here have reached epidemic levels , and too many of us have an out - of - sight , out - of - mind attitude			1
enough with timid politicians afraid to offend the gun lobby			0
enough with voters making the stupid and nonsensical argument that the government wants all of our guns			0
as a nation that trumpets being the best in the world , let 's stop outdistancing gun deaths in @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113			0
if we want to lead , let 's lead in changing directions when it comes to our gun culture			0
@entity18 's gun obsession is unhealthy , unwise and deadly			0
delaying the conversation does nothing for all of us			0
it 's time to stand up and lead , @entity18			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity127 .			2

@entity127 : gun lovers should be free to own shotguns , pistols and the like but not @entity11
@entity127 supports right to own gun but says @entity40 does n't say any gun you *'d* like
he says @entity63 is wrong to oppose reasonable restrictions
he says president is right about ak - 47s -- they belong on *battlefield* , not city streets
