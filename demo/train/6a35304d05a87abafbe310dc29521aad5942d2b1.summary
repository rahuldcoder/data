-- @entity1 's got a lot planned for its wednesday press event			1
while the invitation -- " come see our latest creation " -- is broad and vague , it 's fairly obvious that the biggest news will be the widely anticipated tablet			2
tech observers have been anticipating an @entity1 tablet for several years , churning out report after report of rumors and speculation			1
and @entity1 has been considering tablet designs since at least 1983			1
now , perfectionist ceo @entity18 finally seems satisfied enough with the product to show it off in public			0
are you excited about the @entity1 tablet ? but that 's not the only thing the company is likely to announce			1
updates to the @entity27 line and the @entity28 are also likely to be on the ticket			2
here 's our guide to what you can realistically expect			0
and if you do n't care to read our predictions , just stay tuned for the january 27 event			0
we 'll be providing live blog and news coverage here on @entity40 and on @entity41 : follow @ bxchen and @entity43 for real - time news nuggets			0
the @entity1 tablet multiple independent reports have described the tablet 's appearance as a 10 - to 11 - inch @entity28 or @entity48			1
( @entity50 's sources describe the tablet as " a first - generation @entity28 that 's met its match with a rolling pin			1
" ) the tablet , many have reported , will serve as a slate - like substitute for magazines , newspapers and books , while also offering the general - purpose functions seen in the @entity28 , such as gaming , viewing photos , web surfing and using apps			1
a recent report from @entity67 said @entity1 will market the tablet to be shared among multiple people at home or in classrooms , thanks to its bigger screen			1
a few reports have claimed the tablet will sport a 10 - inch oled touchscreen , which would be great for reading books			2
but there are n't many of these displays on the market , and they would also cost @entity1 about $ 400 apiece			2
a 10 - inch lcd touchscreen , on the other hand , would cost @entity1 $ 60 , much more in line with the expected $ 1,000 price tag			1
the true mystery about the tablet lies in its software and user interface			0
simply expanding the @entity28 to fit a larger screen ca n't be the whole story			2
we expect a tablet interface that strives to appeal to everyone , like the @entity28 does with its 3.5 - inch screen , @entity98 user interface and fingertip - sized icons			1
the ergonomics of text entry will especially be challenging on a device that size			0
people briefed on the product say it will incorporate a virtual keyboard			0
but if the tablet is going to serve as an alternative to a notebook or netbook , an ordinary virtual qwerty is n't going to cut it			0
we 're predicting @entity1 will incorporate new multitouch gestures , and maybe even the accelerometer , to trigger functions of the traditional qwerty keyboard			2
imagine if pressing two fingers down anywhere triggered the shift key , for example			0
and to add a wild guess , we think @entity1 will expand on the voice - recognition feature seen in the @entity124 , to augment text entry			1
still , no one outside @entity1 's tablet team has a solid idea of what the tablet 's interface will be like			1
the only minuscule clue is a quote from a recently departed @entity1 employee who told @entity136 ' @entity135 , " you will be very surprised how you interact with the new tablet			1
" if it 's taken @entity1 this long to figure it out , i 'm sure we will be			1
but we do expect the tablet 's operating system to share some of the same dna as the @entity28 indeed , the @entity28 reportedly contains some elements of an older , shelved @entity1 tablet project			1
what could it be called ? internet sleuths at @entity148 have found evidence suggesting @entity1 is interested in the names @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity151			1
@entity1 has apparently filed for trademarks for each of those names			2
@entity1 not only filed for the @entity151 trademark ; the company also procured ownership of the domain @entity160 , making this the most likely candidate			1
as for when the tablet will ship , @entity67 published the most credible report to date claiming @entity1 has plans to ship the device in march			1
price tag ? all we 've heard are guesses from analysts , some who claim the tablet will cost as much as $ 1,000 including carrier subsidy			0
we estimate the tablet should cost between $ 700 and $ 1,000 , placing it somewhere in between an @entity28 and a @entity27			2
there are a few scant rumors claiming the tablet will be carried by @entity178 , but none seems substantive enough to bet money on			0
there 's too little information out there about the carrier to make any reasonable predictions			0
in summary : @entity187 , ilife 2010 @entity190 ' @entity189 had a scoop citing anonymous @entity1 employees who claim @entity193 will be announced at the event			2
the tablet will likely have a beefed - up version of the @entity28 with all the newest features			1
so given the logic that the tablet os is ready to be announced , @entity187 should be ready for a preview as well			0
but a preview would probably be it , just so @entity1 can begin seeding betas to developers to prepare their @entity28 apps for 4.0			1
as for @entity188 , @entity1 has announced almost all of its ilife suites during january of years past			2
i believe we 'll see an @entity188 launch only because it would be consistent			0
@entity18 likes to pepper up press events with small announcements leading up to the major " one more thing , " so @entity188 and @entity187 will probably be the first to be announced			0
@entity216 upgrades -- maybe an @entity218 contest promoted by e-mail appeared to leak upcoming @entity220 equipped with the newest @entity218 chips			0
@entity218 had sent e-mails to members of its @entity225 program , promoting a chance to win two @entity220 equipped with @entity218 's new core i5 processors during january , according to a report by @entity148			0
however , @entity218 soon after retracted the promotion , saying it was a mistake and that @entity232 notebooks would be given away for the contest instead			0
i found this move suspicious , because the promotion had been sent in multiple languages to members in the @entity238 , the @entity239 and @entity240			0
seems odd that it would have gotten so far if the product were n't even real			0
plus , @entity220 are due for a refresh			0
@entity1 last upgraded the @entity216 in june 2009 , and typically the company refreshes notebooks every six or seven months			2
therefore , my gut tells me @entity218 realized it accidentally leaked the @entity247 and then moved to undo the slip			0
i believe there 's a good chance @entity247 will be announced at next week 's event			2
@entity252 i have n't seen any rumors of @entity1 introducing a new version of @entity255 , but i assume it would have to , in order to launch the tablet			1
that 's because the tablet alone wo n't be compelling unless it creates avenues for new content that can be used on the tablet , such as e-books , newspapers and magazines			0
expect @entity1 to preview a new version of @entity255 , perhaps 9.1 , that would add new content sections to the @entity268			1
we 'll most realistically see a new e-book section demonstrated in @entity255 , as @entity1 has reportedly been in talks with @entity272 to make e-books for the tablet			1
