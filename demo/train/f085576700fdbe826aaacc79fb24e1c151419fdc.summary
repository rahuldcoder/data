@entity0 -- amid exotic trees in a garden setting rest @entity0 's extraordinary and ordinary , those who died heroically in wars , ignominiously in drunken brawls , or suicide ; victims of accidents , pestilence , and pirates ; barkeepers , prostitutes , children , and luminaries whose names are today borne on street signs			1
it 's a far cry from the highway overpass outside the gates			2
charting the 8,500 or so names and weaving their stories together into a 624 - page book , " @entity24 : a social history of the @entity28 , " is @entity25 , who spent about a decade on the project			1
the cemetery had only a record of graves -- which date from 1841 to 2007 -- identifying them by section but not with precise locations , while the earliest graves had no information , @entity29 said			1
a " fanatical friend " from the @entity45 spurred her on to the cemetery project after @entity29 had dedicated a chapter of her last book , " discovering @entity0 's @entity43 : @entity0 and @entity46 " to the @entity48 cemeteries			1
the friend was none other than @entity51 who has recorded graves in the @entity54 foothills of @entity55			1
she came to @entity0 to help			1
when she left , @entity29 could n't stop			2
" since i was in it , i might as well finish , " she explained			2
with inscriptions as a starting point , @entity29 and a host of volunteers recorded each grave into a database , assigning it a section , row and number			2
then she pored through now - defunct newspapers -- like @entity67 , the friend of @entity69 , the @entity70 -- personal and travel accounts , histories and every book on @entity0 she could get her hands on			1
" it seemed such a waste of opportunity -- and stories -- not to link them , " @entity29 said			1
" if you just go through the cemetery , plot - by - plot ... no one would have taken any interest			1
it seemed imperative to link , if people were going to get to know them			0
" out of it emerged a social history of , if not @entity0 , then of the cemetery whose names have included the " @entity92 " and the " @entity93			1
" adjacent to it are separate cemeteries for @entity96 , jews , @entity98 , and @entity99 , while @entity100 were given land for their temple			0
the @entity69 , on the other hand , " were always at the bottom of the pile " despite being the majority , said @entity29			0
" they were n't trusted , and they were n't accorded respect of other nationalities here			0
" although some 225 @entity69 are buried in the @entity28 , @entity69 did n't get their own permanent cemetery -- in @entity112 , on the south of the island -- until 1915 , decades after other groups got theirs			1
@entity0 was " a hard , unhealthy place to live , " @entity29 said			1
" it was a gamble			0
you sacrificed health for wealth			0
but that was maybe why they were so wealth - conscious			1
you knew you were sacrificing , that you 'd probably die			0
" the cemetery opened at its current location in 1845 after its former spot -- just east of where the office tower @entity129 3 now stands -- overflowed beyond capacity			1
@entity0 had become a @entity45 colony only three years earlier			1
read about a floating cemetery concept particularly prominent at the time were doctors , two of whom -- dr. @entity136 and dr. @entity137 -- have the cemetery 's biggest monuments and most appreciative epitaphs , according to @entity29			1
they were among four colonial surgeons who died within a 12 - year period of malarial fever in @entity0			1
@entity0 was n't really " happy " or a place for @entity147 women , @entity29 said			1
with a high ratio of lonely bachelors in a transient population , brothels and bars were in high demand			1
" there were @entity156 taverns , @entity158 taverns , @entity160 taverns , " including @entity162 ' @entity161 , which opened in the 1850s after its namesake novel was published , said @entity29			0
@entity162 , a @entity167 buried in @entity168 , died at age 29 , leaving his widow to run the business			0
among the 465 graves that belong to @entity173 are ship crewmen , shop owners , employees of trading firms as well as prostitutes , according to @entity29			2
one monument to @entity180 bears the signatures of 58 girls , suggesting she was either a much - loved prostitute or a brothel keeper			2
also buried at the cemetery are the first to not only make their fortunes in @entity0 but also give to it : financier and developer sir @entity190 , who transformed @entity0 and @entity46 waterfronts ; sir @entity192 , founder of the medical school that would evolve into the @entity195 ; and @entity196 , who built a commercial empire			1
others meanwhile died without a trace except for the inscription on their tombstones , @entity29 said			0
old graves were difficult to read , requiring multiple trips under different light conditions			2
" some i never managed to read			0
there were also family members who had the same names			0
and then there were @entity69 who went by as many as three or four names during the course of a lifetime , whether it was during school , used for family purposes or attained upon wealth			0
in the late 19th century , the @entity218 staff helped the cemetery evolve from a simple graveyard to a lush cemetery garden inspired by those in @entity147 , like @entity223 in @entity224 and @entity226 's @entity225 , according to one landscape architect			2
the experimentation with exotic plants helped enrich the cemetery 's landscape , turning it into a habitat for dozens of butterfly and moth species , said @entity235 , who wrote " the @entity236 of the @entity28			2
" for @entity29 's husband , @entity238 , cemeteries are for ceremonies , not for idle strolls			0
" you do n't go there for recreation			0
" @entity29 , who is " over 76 , " has had some close calls -- she once tripped , cutting her knee on a metal railing with jagged points ; another time she got locked in the cemetery after hours and had to climb out through a government building			2
she also once borrowed somebody 's grave to rest while suffering what a doctor later diagnosed as " broken heart syndrome , " an incident similar to a minor heart attack			0
" not everyone is willing to do all this hard work and then put it out in the open for everyone to benefit from , " wrote @entity259 , who has listed the names , graves and inscriptions compiled by @entity29 on his website , @entity264 , which is dedicated to historic @entity0			1
" the database gives the basic details , but the book adds the stories that bring the people to life , " he said			1
@entity275 , who 's based in the @entity45 , had been trying to find her grandfather 's first wife , @entity276 , since 1979			0
all she knew was that @entity276 was born in 1869 , married dr. @entity278 and died at age 20 of dysentery , while he was on a tour of duty with the @entity282 in @entity0			1
then last month , @entity275 was resuming research into her family tree when she found @entity276 's information on @entity286 : " in loving memory of @entity276 , wife of @entity288 " in section 18			0
in an e-mail to @entity1 , @entity275 described being " thrilled and elated			0
" @entity291 also credits @entity29 and @entity264 for helping solve a years - long mystery over @entity293 , the favorite brother of his @entity295 grandmother , who has always said he went off to @entity296 to join the @entity297 and died unexpectedly			2
even so , @entity291 , who lives in @entity298 , @entity296 , could never find evidence of @entity293 's ever being in @entity0 until it suddenly appeared on @entity301 one day			1
" it was a marvelous breakthrough , " @entity291 wrote , adding , " it solved a mystery no one else seemed terribly concerned about			0
" @entity293 's listing identifies him as a police sergeant for the @entity297 from @entity308 , @entity295 , and who died in 1928 at the age of 30			0
@entity311 and his wife , @entity312 , are among 108 @entity313 buried in the cemetery			2
all that was known of him for decades was that he had escaped for @entity69 after the @entity317 , said his grandnephew , @entity318 , in an e-mail from @entity320			0
then in 2004 , @entity318 typed " @entity311 " into a browser -- and to his " amazement " discovered that @entity311 ' name appeared as an engineer for the @entity325 of the @entity326 in @entity327 during the 1930s			0
with the help of a @entity313 priest , he found the grave and subsequently learned that @entity311 ' work with the @entity333 had taken the couple to @entity0 in 1948			1
he lived to the ripe old age of 88 on the second floor of a @entity46 apartment building , surviving @entity312 by nearly 30 years and leaving his entire estate to his longtime amah , or maid			0
having been regarded as " stateless " and the " people 's enemy , " @entity311 had never gotten in touch with his family in @entity313 apparently fearing harm would come to them , said @entity318			0
he has since posted the info on @entity301 in hopes of learning more about @entity311 's life			0
" it 's full of stories , this cemetery , " said @entity29 , who now splits time between @entity0 and @entity158			1
" they are like old friends , yes			0
" for now , the @entity355 operates the cemetery , which has yet to attain heritage status .			2

@entity25 charts 8,500 graves , weaves stories in 624 - page book
she pored through now - defunct newspapers , accounts , old records , histories
out of it emerges a social history of @entity0 and the cemetery
doctors were prominent , fever was high ; brothels , bars very popular
