@entity0 , @entity1 -- a former member of the @entity5 monitoring team in @entity1 said he resigned from the mission because it is " providing the regime cover for more killing " and " shameful " brutality			1
" i quit because i found myself serving the regime and not part of an independent monitoring body , " @entity11 , an @entity12 , told @entity13 in an interview wednesday			1
his remarks were translated by @entity2			2
" i am unable to stop the killing			2
" the @entity5 embarked on a fact - finding mission in @entity1 in december , part of an initiative to end the bloody 10 - month - long crackdown by president @entity25 's government against peaceful protesters			1
@entity27 wants the government to stop violence against civilians , free political detainees , remove tanks and weapons from cities and allow outsiders , including the international news media , to travel freely around @entity1			2
the purpose of the mission is to see how the government is adhering to the plan			2
the @entity5 confirmed to @entity2 that @entity11 was part of the observer team			1
@entity42 , an @entity5 official in @entity43 , told @entity2 that @entity11 had been sick during his stint and attended only a limited number of field visits			1
he " had requested to fly to @entity47 for medical treatment during the mission			0
he has excused himself from the mission , " @entity42 said			0
@entity11 's comments reflect the position of opposition activists , who regularly report government brutality and document casualties			1
" it 's practicing the same activities more blatantly , " @entity11 said of the @entity1 government			1
" it 's even killing its supporters to convince the @entity61 monitors that the regime is just doing their job to provide security and to gain sympathy			0
i felt like i myself would become a government thug , that 's why i 've quit			0
" asked what he witnessed and what led to his resignation , @entity11 described grisly scenes in @entity73 , the restive city that has been an epicenter of @entity76 sentiment			1
" most importantly , the human feeling that i lived over 15 days in @entity73 ; i was in @entity73 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80			1
i 've been to all these areas , i 've seen shameful scenes , burnt bodies that had undergone torture , skinned bodies , children murdered , and every now and then we would see someone shot by a sniper			1
i 've seen all of that with my own eyes			0
i just can not give up my humanity in the face of that or pretend to be independent or neutral when faced with it , " he added			0
@entity11 said he viewed detention facilities and " found people in a definitely deplorable and tragic state			1
" " people are undergoing systematic torture and starvation , where they are only given one snack a day , although those who underwent severe conditions were secretly transported to other areas , such as military zones or facilities that we know nothing about			0
" he also claimed that there were " soldiers and maybe intelligence officers that were presented to us as being prisoners			2
" asked how he would know that , @entity11 said he has " some experience with prisons			1
" " when someone lives in such a place , his odor would be similar to that of the jail cell			0
some of those people smelled like women 's perfume			0
where did that come from ? " @entity11 was also asked about remarks from the head of the monitors , who had said the situation is n't as bad as @entity11 said it is			1
@entity132 lt. gen. @entity131 is heading the observation mission			0
" i believe that the head of the monitors wants to hold the stick from the middle , in order not to upset the authority or any other party			0
he picks his words so not to upset anybody			0
he always discourages us from speaking to the media so as not to say something that would upset a certain party and hence hinder our work			0
but the situation is tragic and @entity73 and all other areas in @entity73 that i 've been to for a while can only be described as an absolute disaster zone			2
houses are destroyed after being bombarded by heavy weapons , all signs show that heavy weapons are still there , " @entity11 said			2
journalist @entity156 contributed to this report			0
