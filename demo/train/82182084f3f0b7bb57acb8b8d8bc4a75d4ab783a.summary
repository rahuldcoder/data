-- every morning @entity1 goes on a 7 a.m. walk around his neighborhood - not for exercise , but for money			1
@entity7 is a paper scavenger			1
his currency is waste paper			2
for the past three years , he has dug into dirty garbage cans to pull out old newsprint and has shuffled through dimly - lit back alleys to haul out used cardboard boxes			0
an empty carton of @entity17 cigarettes , a torn envelope for an electricity bill and a pink pastry box get stuffed into his shoulder bag today			0
he sells it all to a recycler for money			0
" each month i might earn $ 100 or $ 200 or $ 300 @entity25 dollars , " @entity7 says			1
that 's $ 12 to $ 36 @entity27 dollars and is his only source of income			1
the short , rumpled 50 - year old talks through a slight smile but his circumstances are no joke			0
" i never thought that i would be doing this , " @entity7 admits			1
" i do it to survive , it 's my livelihood			2
" @entity7 's life stands in stark contrast to a @entity25 more famous for its iconic skyline and glitzy high life as an @entity43 hub for global financial firms			1
a @entity25 government report released last month revealed that the city 's wealth gap is the widest in the developed world			1
@entity7 is a prime example of that other extreme			1
and he is not the only one			0
" there are an estimated 10,000 people who are recycling scavengers in @entity25 , " says @entity52 , a well - known local rights activist and social worker for @entity25 's @entity54 , or @entity55			1
but paper scavengers like @entity7 are making much less money today than last year			1
the reason is thousands of miles away , says @entity62 , president of one of @entity25 's oldest recycling companies			1
" @entity65 is facing many economic problems and this has translated to fewer manufacturing orders for clothes and toys in @entity70 , " explains @entity62			1
" fewer orders mean a slowing demand for paper boxes , so prices have fallen dramatically			2
" standing among bales of crushed plastic bottles and piles of books waiting to be recycled , @entity62 says that one kilogram of waste paper would have gotten about 18 cents this time last year			2
today , that value has been halved			0
@entity82 , who runs the @entity70 - based blog @entity83 , says the recycling industry as a whole is one of the first to experience a slowdown in the event of a global economic slump			1
" the street prices [ for scrap metal ] are down along the east coast of @entity70 -- down 50 % from highs of about 6 months ago			2
they 're very sensitive to demand for raw materials			0
" and the paper industry can be even more delicate			2
" @entity102 might be the most consumer sensitive of all because it 's used in packaging - and packaging is used for everything , " said @entity82 , who has just finished writing a book about the globalization of the waste and recycling industry			2
and @entity25 waste recovery companies are feeling the pinch because 98 % of @entity25 's recovered paper goes to be recycled in @entity70 , says @entity62			1
he adds several of the city 's 400 firms have already closed down			2
and he 's not optimistic the economy will make a comeback this year			0
" july is when prices should start to pick up			0
retailers in @entity65 and the @entity27 should be placing their @entity118 orders right now but business has remained relatively quiet			1
the second half of this year is looking rather grim			0
" @entity62 said he earned up to $ 400,000 last year			0
this year , he expects to just break even			0
as for @entity7 , his hope is just a dollar a day			2
like @entity62 , he is equally uncertain about the future			0
back at his tiny 9th story walk - up , entirely subsidized by the government , @entity7 stashes his paper trash in a corner under a table until he makes his weekly trek to the recycler			1
the money he makes mostly goes to food for himself , his disabled 32 - year old wife and his 10 - year old daughter			0
@entity7 , who moved to @entity25 from @entity136 province three years ago , explains that is the only thing he can do for money			1
he never went to high school and only did four years of elementary school -- two years at each level because of his mental disability			0
" i 'm not sure about next year			0
prices might rise or fall			0
it 's like buying shares , you never know whether they are going to rise or fall			0
" and so @entity7 's only hedge is to keep scavenging for even more paper , shuffling along the city 's streets and hoping that prices rise again			1
@entity0 's @entity153 and @entity154 contributed to this report			0

10,000 of @entity25 's poor depend on **collecting** scrap paper
the slowdown in @entity65 is *hurting* paper *collectors* like @entity1
@entity7 makes between $ 12 and $ 36 **collecting** scrap paper from trash
the scrap business is a *bellwether* industry for rising or falling business cycles
