@entity0 had just fallen when heavily armed @entity3 commandos approached a residence on the @entity5 in @entity6 , a sleepy town in eastern @entity3			1
they knew the three men inside -- all suspected to be hardened @entity3 @entity10 veterans who had returned from fighting in @entity11 -- were likely to be armed and dangerous because they had put them under 24 - hour surveillance for several weeks , according to a senior @entity3 counterterrorism official			1
wiretaps of phone conversations and listening devices indicated the cell members -- who had been under observation for just under two months and were all from in and around the @entity23 district of @entity24 -- were in the final stages of preparing a major terrorist attack in @entity3 , the official told @entity1			1
two suspected members of the cell had taken up lodging in the residence			0
@entity3 security services had learned they were using the building as a safe house to store automatic weapons and chemicals to make explosives			0
the trigger for the arrests was the arrival at the safe house of a third @entity10 veteran suspected of being the quartermaster of the plot , tasked with providing the cell logistical support and providing it with equipment and supplies			2
@entity3 security services wanted to arrest all three together , according to the official , and simultaneously make other arrests of suspects across @entity3			2
they believed the cell had as many as 10 members			0
what happened next around 5:45 p.m. january 15 was the biggest firefight @entity3 commandos have faced since @entity56 , captured for the world to see on a home movie shot by one of the town 's residents			1
toxic mix that makes @entity3 fertile ground for terrorism after the commandos broke into the safe house , the two @entity10 fighters who had taken up lodging in the building grabbed @entity70 , returned automatic fire and lobbed grenades , using urban warfare skills honed in @entity11 , according to the official			1
but @entity3 commandos soon shot them both dead and took the suspected quartermaster of the plot into custody after he jumped out of a window			1
inside , @entity3 police discovered automatic weapons and chemicals necessary to make the high explosive @entity83 , an explosive many times more powerful than that used by the @entity86 bombers			0
they also discovered police uniforms , suggesting the plotters hoped to gain access to sensitive sites in @entity3 , according to the senior @entity3 counterterrorism official			1
a @entity94 camera was also recovered , suggesting the cell might have been planning to film the attacks for propaganda			0
@entity3 police made 13 arrests that night			0
within hours , @entity3 officials announced they had thwarted a major imminent terrorist attack by fighters who had returned from @entity11			1
@entity3 authorities publicly stated the cell 's target was believed to be police officers and police stations			2
@entity3 security services had listened to conversations in which the cell members discussed killing police , according to the senior @entity3 counterterrorism official			1
but the official told @entity1 investigators believe the group planned a much more ambitious and spectacular attack with police just being a " bonus target			2
" the official said that investigators do not yet know the cell 's main target or targets but are hopeful they will find out			0
@entity24 houses the headquarters of the @entity122 's institutions and @entity123			0
@entity3 authorities later identified the two dead gunmen as @entity125 and @entity126 and the alleged quartermaster of the plot as @entity129			0
@entity130 was charged with " participation in a terrorist organization , possession of explosives with intent to commit a criminal attack and prohibited possession of weapons			0
" the senior @entity3 counterterrorism official said @entity130 was " like a machine " in furnishing the cell with the supplies they needed to carry out the attack			1
when @entity3 commandos moved in , he was still searching for an ice machine so the @entity83 the group was poised to make could be cooled and transported , according to the official			1
" tatp is very unstable and would explode otherwise , " they said			0
@entity130 's lawyer , @entity148 , told @entity1 his client denied having anything to do with terrorism and that @entity130 was in the apartment in @entity6 to bring a pair of shoes to his friend			0
he said @entity130 jumped out of the window because the apartment was on fire			0
the @entity3 official told @entity160 has refused to talk to investigators			2
@entity130 and two others charged with terrorist offenses in the plot remain in custody			0
a 33 - year - old @entity166 extradited to @entity3 after being arrested in @entity167 was also charged with terrorism offenses in relation to the plot			1
the senior counterterrorism official told @entity1 the @entity166 had connections to the cell in @entity3			1
the two dead gunmen and @entity130 were all in communication by phone with a suspected @entity3 @entity10 operative named @entity178 , a 27 - year - old @entity3 - @entity179 from @entity23			1
@entity3 investigators believed he was the ringleader of the cell and the " link person " to the senior leadership of @entity10 in @entity11 , according to the senior @entity3 counterterrorism official			1
for security reasons , the cell members had an elaborate system to make the phone calls and used coded language			0
the @entity166 extradited to @entity3 also had links to @entity178 according to the official			2
in the weeks before the plot was thwarted , @entity3 counterterrorism agencies traced the calls to a cell phone in @entity167 that they believed was being used by @entity178 , according to the official			1
other intelligence gathering indicated @entity178 was linked to several senior @entity10 operatives in @entity11			1
@entity3 investigators believe @entity10 senior leadership directed the cell to launch the attack in @entity3 , according to the official			1
the @entity3 brought in @entity202 intelligence agencies , including the @entity203 , to try to locate the cell phone in @entity167 , but neither the @entity202 nor @entity167 police were able to locate @entity178 , according to the official			1
on thursday , @entity10 claimed in a new issue of its @entity208 online language magazine @entity209 that @entity178 had safely returned to @entity11 and posted several pictures of him			1
one picture taken at some point in 2014 in @entity11 featured @entity178 standing next to what @entity10 claimed were the two gunmen killed in the @entity6 siege			2
they identified them as " @entity218 ( @entity219 ) , and @entity220 ( @entity221 )			0
" the @entity3 counterterrorism official confirmed to @entity1 the photograph did indeed feature the men killed in the raid last month : @entity126 and @entity125			1
in a purported q&a with @entity209 magazine , @entity178 claimed he had traveled to @entity3 with the two gunmen			0
@entity3 investigators are skeptical of that claim and have no evidence to suggest he was able to reach @entity3			0
but the senior @entity3 counterterrorism official said the trail for @entity178 has gone cold , and it is possible he was able to return to @entity11 from @entity167			1
" i was able to leave and come to @entity234 despite being chased after by so many intelligence agencies			0
my name and picture were all over the news yet i was able to stay in their homeland , plan operations against them , and leave safely when doing so became necessary , " @entity178 claimed in the q&a according to @entity10			0
@entity178 is believed to have joined @entity10 in @entity11 in early 2014 after traveling from @entity3 , according to @entity244 , the editor of " emmejihad , " a blog on @entity3 foreign fighters			1
at some point , his younger 13 - year - old brother joined him there becoming the youngest @entity3 jihadi in @entity11			2
according to @entity244 , @entity178 developed ties to a @entity254 @entity10 brigade called @entity255			0
in @entity11 , @entity178 became known by the fighting names @entity257 and @entity258			0
after joining @entity10 , @entity178 posted several videos of himself on the front lines			0
in one of them , he can be heard saying " it 's not fun seeing blood spilled , but it gives me pleasure from time to time to see blood of the disbelievers run because we grew up watching the blood of @entity269 being spilled in the whole world on tv			0
" in march 2014 , the video and photo files on one of @entity178 's cell phones was obtained by the journalist @entity276 from sources in a @entity279 refugee camp on the @entity281 border			0
in a report @entity276 filed for the @entity3 news channel @entity283 , @entity178 is seen driving a car dragging the corpses of @entity11 army fighters			2
in @entity209 magazine , @entity178 acknowledged that " a brother had taken video footage of some of us before a battle , but his camera got lost and was later sold by a murtadd ( a lapsed @entity269 ) to a @entity296 journalist			0
" @entity178 's family in @entity3 , after hearing nothing from @entity178 after he traveled to @entity11 , received word in october he had been killed in fighting , they revealed in interviews with the @entity3 media			2
@entity3 counterterrorism officials believe he faked his own death so he could travel more easily to @entity306 to coordinate the plot			1
western intelligence agencies believe the @entity3 plot indicates @entity10 is pivoting toward attacking the @entity310 , according to a senior @entity306 counterterrorism official			1
intelligence suggests the group is seeking to send back @entity306 recruits to target the @entity306 countries involved in airstrikes against it , according to the official			0
the @entity319 , @entity320 , @entity321 , @entity322 and @entity3 are carrying out strikes against @entity10 positions in @entity325			2
more than 750 @entity306 extremists have returned to @entity306 after joining jihadist groups in @entity11 and @entity325 , according to official estimates			2
the @entity3 official said @entity3 was facing an unprecedented terrorist threat with significant concern returning fighters from @entity11 or @entity10 - inspired lone wolves could be plotting attacks			1
last week , sen. @entity335 , a @entity336 from @entity337 and a member of the @entity339 , told @entity1 's @entity340 that intelligence suggested @entity10 was " moving beyond the aspirational " when it came to plotting attacks against @entity306 and the @entity202 homeland .			2
