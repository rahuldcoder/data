picture this : august 2014 and @entity2 speaker @entity1 is on the campaign trail in @entity4 stomping for then - congressional hopeful @entity5			2
he 's in front of a small , yet attentive crowd engaged in one of his favorite pastimes -- bashing president @entity10			2
in his talk , he criticized the president 's response to @entity15 's takeover of @entity16 , asking the group " does anybody think that @entity19 would have gone into @entity16 had @entity20 been president of the @entity21 ? " he then answers his own question			2
" no ! even @entity19 is smart enough to know that @entity20 would have punched him in the nose in about 10 seconds ! " @entity1 even pantomimed what the proposed punch would look like , much to the delight of his audience			2
it was a theatrical showing			2
when @entity15 invaded the @entity29 , a @entity21 ally , in 2008 , @entity20 did not come close to punching @entity19 or then - @entity15 prime minister @entity31 in the nose -- literally or diplomatically			2
in fact , the country 's response to the invasion â€” which did not include military action -- was so weak one @entity29 soldier fighting for his country 's sovereignty told the @entity41 that " @entity21 and the @entity42 are spitting on us			1
" but the small band of voters in that room likely did not remember or ever even knew the truth			2
this is the mouthpiece @entity49 chose to speak on their behalf -- for a third time			2
and things will be different between @entity53 and the @entity2 how ? much is said about @entity10 's low - to mid- 40 % job approval numbers -- but have you seen @entity53 ? in six of the past seven years , its job approval average has been less than 20 % , according to @entity58			1
before 2008 , only twice in the 40 years @entity58 has measured @entity53 ' approval has it been that low			1
in short , @entity1 , rep. @entity61 , sen. @entity62 and sen. @entity63 have been the leaders , presiding over the worst stretch of job approval numbers this branch of government has had since 1974			2
pandering , misrepresenting facts , massaging the truth -- these are all part of the game of politics			0
@entity1 and his contemporaries are neither unique nor inherently bad people for playing by these distasteful rules			0
yet there 's something profoundly deflating about seeing the same leaders of what was routinely referred to as " the worst @entity53 in history " all back to reprise their staring roles in 2015 ( though @entity84 has swapped jobs with @entity62 as @entity86 lost control of the @entity88 to the @entity89 in the midterms )			1
" now we can get @entity53 going " read the headline of a @entity93 op - ed @entity1 co-penned with @entity84 , as if someone else was stopping votes in the @entity2			1
on the other side , @entity62 ignored more than 700 @entity2 - passed bills during the 110th @entity53 alone -- and that was when @entity61 was speaker			1
he was replaced by @entity84 , who said " there 's only one @entity100 who counts : the president , " in the same interview in which he talked about reaching across the aisle			0
yeah , i can see a lot of bipartisanship happening now			0
barely a week in , and @entity89 were threatening to defund parts of the department that helps protect the border to punish a president they say is not serious about protecting the border			1
also in the hopper : the @entity115 , a project that studies found is neither the job creator nor the environment destroyer each opposing party claims it to be			0
this is why for all the hoopla about changes in @entity53 , 60 % of @entity21 believe nothing will change			1
" long term incumbency leads to politicians who seem to care more about what is best for their career than what is best for their country , " sen. @entity125 wrote in 2009 , advocating for term limits			0
" some pundits like to remark that we already have term limits , they 're called ' elections			0
' this glib response ignores the fact that incumbent @entity21 senators start each election cycle with an average of $ 8 million dollars in the bank			0
the average @entity21 representative starts with over $ 1 million in the bank			0
" in 1994 , then @entity2 speaker @entity147 pushed a series of reforms designed to circulate more members through leadership jobs			0
among those changes : term limits for the job of speaker of the @entity2			0
unfortunately , it was overturned by @entity89 in 2003			1
worse yet , @entity157 failed to get the votes needed to impose term limits on members of @entity53			1
that , too , was thwarted by some of his @entity89 brethren			1
" if this were a trial , i 'd call as my first witnesses the @entity172 , who directly and unanimously rejected term limits , " @entity165 chairman @entity164 , @entity166 , said in a debate on the floor at the time			0
i wo n't bore you with the list of things the @entity172 " unanimously rejected " that we consider common sense today			0
i 'll just point out the irony of @entity182 , the author of @entity183 , owning hundreds of slaves -- and slowly walk away			0
in any case , @entity53 appears to be stuck with @entity1 and company , which means the country is			1
( all these four need to do to stay in power is to get re-elected in districts where they have strong support and then retain the votes of their colleagues in @entity53			1
and as we saw in the aftermath of @entity1 's re-election , dissenters will be punished			0
) hopefully , the leaders of @entity53 will keep their promise and actually put the @entity21 people 's needs ahead of their own pursuit of power			1
or maybe enough voters will notice the correlation between the " worst @entity53 in history " and the quartet that 's been leading it for nearly a decade			1
call me a cynic , but i 'm not holding my breath for either			0
although it 's worth noting that the only district in @entity4 that @entity89 lost in november was the one in which @entity1 was seen telling his whopper about @entity20 punching @entity19 in the nose			1
maybe those folks were paying attention after all .			0
