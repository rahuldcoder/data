-- politics is in the blood of @entity4 's prime minister @entity3			1
his father was the country 's second prime minister , and his uncle , the third			2
@entity3 has continued the political dynasty with a career in politics and became his country 's leader in 2009			1
in @entity4 's multi-ethnic and multi-religious society , he has presided over some flash points since taking office , most recently the violent response earlier this year by @entity22 fundamentalists to a court ruling that allowed @entity24 to use the word @entity26			1
pursuing a policy to strengthen national unity , called " @entity29 , " he thinks that , contrary to what many commentators believe , multi-culturalism is working in a country where affirmative action laws were enacted in 1971			0
" in spite of the huge diversity in @entity4 in terms of religion , culture , race , ethnicity and so forth , we 've really gone very far in developing this country , " he told @entity0			2
" and i 'm confident this journey for @entity4 to become a fully developed nation , high - income nation , by 2020 is doable			2
" @entity4 has seen 7 percent economic growth this year , but the possibility of a " brain drain " of skilled and talented @entity4 going abroad has prompted @entity3 and his government to address a growing problem			1
" we have recognized it [ as a problem ]			0
there 's going to be huge change in government policies in this regard , " he said , and indicated an announcement on the issue will be made later this month			2
on @entity62 and @entity63 's role in the region he is phlegmatic : " i do n't see them as threatening the region			0
they will increase their influence , of course , using more of their economic clout to influence events in the region ... so i think both countries are important to @entity4 , and we have a large community of @entity4 @entity62 as well as @entity76			2
" while @entity3 represents the continuity in the top echelons of @entity4 politics , more recent scandals have gained international headlines			1
opposition leader @entity82 is facing trial for sodomy charges , a crime that he was charged with in 1998			1
@entity86 has called the recent charge a threat " to all those in @entity4 who have struggled for a freer and more democratic nation			1
" other commentators have suggested it is politically motivated , which @entity3 refutes			1
" it 's not our choice			0
and we did n't plan for this			0
it so happened that his own employee made a criminal complaint against him , " said @entity3			1
" we 're willing to compete against anyone			0
you know , this is a democracy			0
so let it be , the best party , chosen by the people , will form the government			0
" speaking at the @entity107 in @entity108 in september , @entity3 proposed a global movement of moderates , in part to counter the growing problem of @entity113			1
" i am concerned if 25 percent of @entity114 think that president @entity115 is a @entity22			0
i mean it 's obviously a lack of knowledge			0
but also , it 's for the @entity120 as well , you know , because a small numbers of @entity120 have really painted a very negative image of @entity22 , " he said			0
" it 's a problem between the moderates and the extremists of each religion and if the moderates can have a much stronger voice , then there is every chance that we will find resolution to many of the world 's problems			2
