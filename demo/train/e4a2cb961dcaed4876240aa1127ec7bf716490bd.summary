-- the @entity2 's vote thursday for the " nuclear option " was a move to deprive the minority party in the @entity6 of a procedure it has abused to block president @entity10 's judicial nominees and other appointees			1
before , a single @entity13 could unilaterally and without any reason block a nominee from receiving a simple up - and - down vote on the @entity6 floor			1
the " nuclear option , " an overblown term for changing @entity6 rules to enable judicial and executive nominees to be confirmed with just 51 votes instead of 60 , will put an end to using that procedure -- the filibuster -- to block appointees			1
republicans have been gumming up the works of our government , both because they ideologically favor the dysfunction of government and because they want to fundamentally undermine the president at every step			0
and so during @entity10 's five years in office , @entity26 in the @entity6 have confirmed just one nominee to the @entity36 in @entity37 , often regarded as the nation 's second highest court after the @entity40			1
meanwhile , @entity26 have blocked three appointees to the court and held up countless other nominations to other important posts			2
there had been a concern that if @entity2 went nuclear , nothing would stop @entity26 from employing equally restrictive procedures should @entity2 be the minority party in the @entity6 again			2
and yet , to anyone watching @entity37 today , is there any question that @entity26 have abandoned any sense of bipartisan decorum and are solely functioning as anti-government , @entity55 bullies ? if republicans repeatedly resort to such childish thuggery when they 're the minority party , it 's hard to imagine them behaving much better if they 're put in charge			2
if @entity2 did n't flip the nuclear switch now to allow appointments to go through , @entity26 will surely flip it later			1
at least if @entity2 do it first , they get to finally vote on some critical nominees and move the governance and sanctity of our nation forward			0
in a statement , @entity69 senate minority leader @entity69 had said that attacking @entity71 is a priority over voting to fill key vacancies in the nation 's courts			0
sadly , republicans in @entity77 are making a mockery of their constitutional obligations while turning the hallowed halls of our government into nothing more than a playground for their ideological circus			0
sometimes that circus is so absurd it hurts			0
for instance , @entity26 have repeatedly tried to blame the financial crisis on @entity90 and @entity91 rather than -- for instance -- the deliberate scamming of big banks that are now paying massive settlements for their wrongdoing			0
and yet that topsy - turvy reasoning aside , @entity26 are blocking the nomination of rep. @entity99 to lead the @entity100 , deliberately maintaining a vacancy in the position charged with regulating and monitoring @entity90 and @entity103			0
the @entity104 lays out the @entity6 's responsibility in this regard as clearly secondary to , not equal with , the president 's authority : " [ the president ] shall have @entity110 , by and with the @entity111 of the @entity6 , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the @entity114 present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the @entity111 of the @entity6 , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and @entity117 , judges of the @entity40 , and all other officers of the @entity120 , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by @entity122			1
not block and redirect and hold up and try to impose the will of the @entity6 's minority party on the nominations and actions of the president			1
and so @entity2 have finally had enough with a @entity13 that seems determined to pitch a temper tantrum about everything @entity10 does , no matter that he won two elections and his policies are widely popular with voters			1
after all , even though the president 's approval ratings took a hit , his numbers at 39 % are still " sky high " compared with those of @entity77 , which has a 9 % approval rating according to a recent @entity142 poll			2
that 's the lowest approval rating since @entity142 has collected such data			0
moreover , while such low numbers overall likely reflect voter frustration with the partisan squabble of unproductive government , polls show that voters consistently blame @entity26 far more than @entity2 for this dynamic , whether for causing the government shutdown or deliberately sabotaging economic progress to hurt the president 's image			1
" nuclear option " is a loaded term			2
proponents of the measure call it the " constitutional option " in so far as it is constitutional and it would finally hold @entity6 @entity26 ' feet to the fire to perform their constitutional duty			1
that indeed seems a more accurate description and one that reminds us all that it was @entity26 ' own reckless and destructive behavior that brought us to this point in the first place			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .			0

with " nuclear option , " judicial nominees can be confirmed with a simple *majority* vote
@entity176 : this will keep @entity13 from using a procedure to block president 's appointments
@entity176 : @entity13 made government virtually dysfunctional , blocked @entity10 at every turn
this will hold @entity26 ' feet to the fire to do their constitutional duty , she says
