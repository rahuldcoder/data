-- a federal judge in @entity2 on tuesday unsealed an indictment for airplane theft against an alleged teenage criminal known as " the barefoot bandit			1
" according to the indictment , @entity7 , 19 , stole an aircraft last year in @entity9 and flew it to @entity2 , where authorities found it crashed			1
dna evidence and fingerprints linked @entity7 to the plane theft , the indictment states			1
the elusive fugitive is suspected in previous thefts of small planes			0
in the most recent case , a small high - performance plane stolen from an @entity20 airport over the weekend was found in shallow waters off an island in the @entity24 , officials said , and the details surrounding the incident have people wondering if the " barefoot bandit " was involved			1
now , the @entity30 is offering a $ 10,000 reward for information leading to his arrest			0
an @entity30 statement indicated that agents believe @entity7 was involved in the @entity20 theft , with the statement saying , " should you see @entity7 in the @entity24 , please contact the nearest @entity40			1
" after spending years on the run along the @entity43 , @entity7 had surfaced in recent weeks in the @entity44 , police said			1
@entity45 , director of @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity20 , told @entity0 a 2009 @entity48 was reported missing on july 4			1
@entity45 said the plane was taken from a locked hanger inside an area surrounded by a 12 - foot - tall barbed wire fence			2
" we 've never had an airplane stolen from this airport before , not to my knowledge , " @entity45 told @entity0 , " and i 've been here since 1978			1
" he said the owner of the aircraft was contacted by the @entity60 and was told that the emergency locator transmitter for the @entity62 was sending out a beacon off the coast of an island in the @entity24			1
@entity45 said the sheriff 's department contacted him on june 30 and said a stolen vehicle had been recovered near the airport			2
" the details associated with the stolen vehicle fit the @entity71 of the person known as the barefoot bandit , " he said the authorities told him			1
@entity7 was dubbed the barefoot bandit because he allegedly broke into homes in @entity76 and @entity2 without shoes			1
police suspect he may also have stolen boats and cars in addition to airplanes			2
over the past month , the teen has been linked to a string of thefts and break - ins in @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 , police said			0
authorities said @entity7 may have broken into two airports : @entity93 in @entity94 , @entity88 , and @entity95 in @entity96 , @entity89			2
after authorities told him about the possible connection between the recovered stolen vehicle and the barefoot bandit , @entity45 said , " i made several contacts with the state @entity99 and asked them to put out a bulletin to all airports			1
" but he said any " uncontrolled " airport would be vulnerable to an airplane thief			2
" we 're a general aviation airport , a corporate - class general aviation airport , " @entity45 said			2
" our air traffic control is not manned 24 hours per day			0
we have a controlled airspace from 6:30 in the morning until 9:30 p.m. aircraft can still go from this area and operate under federal aviation rules as they do at all uncontrolled airports			0
" " the bigger question people should be asking , " @entity45 said , " is how could an airplane fly from @entity47 , @entity20 , and fly across states and airspaces and international waters and never be detected ? " @entity7 has become an outlaw hero to tens of thousands of people who have joined a @entity127 tribute page			1
@entity128 , a retired pilot and aviation expert , said his alleged crime spree should not be romanticized			0
" this kid is a punk			0
he 's a brat who is breaking laws all over the place			0
" you are dealing with a thief who is violating federal law and endangering anybody on the ground			0
there is no glamour in this , none whatsoever			0
" @entity138 said that it " would n't be too difficult for @entity7 to fly the plane to the @entity24			1
flying an airplane is not as tough to do as a lot of people would like to think it is , but it is n't like stealing a car			0
you 've got an airplane moving over 200 knots , it 's got a whole bunch of gasoline on board , it 's just dangerous			0
" @entity138 said many pilots are not required to file flight plans			0
" as long as you do n't fly in restricted areas , around airports , military institutions , " he said			0
he also had a message for those who may idolize @entity7 for his alleged escapades			2
" he 's just an idiot pushing his luck " said @entity138 .			0
