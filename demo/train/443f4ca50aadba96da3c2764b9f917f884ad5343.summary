the @entity1 have decided to leave the limits of their namesake city because they got " a terrific deal , " mayor @entity0 said -- one that was sweeter than he felt comfortable supporting for fear of hurting his municipal government long - term			1
" we wanted the @entity1 to stay in @entity11 , but ( there was a ) business problem that we had to solve , " @entity0 said tuesday			2
" that choice was encumbering between $ 150 million and $ 250 million in debt and not having money to do anything else			1
" the mayor chose not to go that route , and partly as a result , the @entity22 franchise is heading about 12 miles north to @entity24			1
this new multimillion - dollar stadium , which will be part of a larger retail and entertainment complex , is scheduled to open in 2017 to the northwest , where two major interstates -- @entity30 75 and 285 -- meet , the @entity1 announced monday			2
@entity11 mayor : cost too high a day later , @entity0 admitted that he was taken aback by the news			0
while the team and city had been engaged in negotiations over the past 18 months -- and he 'd " still felt that we could get a deal done " -- the mayor said his first indication that something had changed came after being contacted by a @entity1 official on november 6 , a day after his re-election			1
@entity0 said he learned about the baseball club 's new thinking , including a reported offer of $ 450 million of public financing from @entity24 , the next day			1
the city of @entity11 was n't asked to put up that much money , nor was it asked to build a new stadium , the mayor said			2
still , the @entity1 did ask for extensive public investments in the publicly owned stadium and the surrounding area , money that @entity0 said he did n't feel the city could give now , given other needs and the desire to keep spending and debt in check			1
the mayor pointed specifically to a $ 922 million infrastructure backlog and desires to upgrade roads , expand public spaces and pursue other improvements across the city			1
" if we made a different decision , " @entity0 said , " every single dollar for everything else would have gone to fund and modernize the stadium			0
" critics have pointed out that , in recent months , city money has been allocated for another stadium in downtown @entity11 : $ 200 million for a new home for the @entity79 's @entity78			1
@entity0 took pains to state that the two stadium deals " candidly are not close			0
" the @entity78 ' one uses revenue from the city 's hotel - motel tax but does n't tap the government 's general fund , as a @entity1 stadium deal might have done			2
plus , the mayor added , " i certainly was not going to try to finance two stadium deals at the exact same time			0
" the team 's contract with @entity93 , which was retrofitted for baseball after the @entity95 , expires in 2016			2
club president @entity96 said in a video message that @entity93 needs " hundreds of millions of dollars of upgrades			2
unfortunately , that massive investment would not do anything to improve access or the fan experience			0
" he vowed that the new stadium site " will be one of the most magnificent in all of baseball			0
it will thrive with action 365 days a year			0
" the surrounding area will be a " mixed - use destination , " he said			0
as to what will then happen with the @entity1 ' current home , @entity0 says it will be demolished to make way for " one of the largest developments for middle - class people that the city of @entity11 has ever had			1
" the mayor pointed out that it was n't like the @entity1 were leaving the region altogether , insisting that they are and will remain his favorite team			1
and he credited @entity24 officials with stepping up to make a strong offer			0
" $ 450 million in public financing is a pretty good deal , " @entity0 said			1
" we ca n't spend money that liberally in the city of @entity11			0
we are fiscal conservatives here			0
" 8 short - lived sports venues			0

@entity93 will be demolished , area will be *redeveloped* , mayor says
the @entity1 vow to leave @entity93 in 2017 , moving to @entity24
@entity24 reportedly offers $ 450 million in public money to move the team 12 miles north
mayor : keeping the franchise may have required $ 150 million to $ 250 million in city funds
