@entity100 , a former @entity43 congresswoman who was shot in the head during a mass shooting , did not speak at the hearing , but she wrote an opinion piece on the issue for @entity1			1
" we urgently need stronger gun laws that protect women , " she wrote			0
" we ca n't wait any longer			0
women 's lives are at stake			1
" @entity100 also announced the @entity111 , which brings together leading women working in both policy and advocacy to push for reforms at the state and federal level to protect women from gun - toting abusers			1
kids and gun safety advocates point to statistics that show that 46 women are shot and killed by a current or former domestic partner each month and that more than half of women murdered are killed by their current or former partners			2
@entity100 wrote that more women were shot to death by an intimate partner between 2001 and 2012 than the number of soldiers killed in both @entity134 and @entity135			2
advocates also point to a recent incident in @entity138 in which police accused a man with a history of domestic violence of shooting and killing many of his estranged wife 's family members during a violent rampage			1
" this is an area where we can really make progress and keep guns out of dangerous hands , " said @entity148 , spokeswoman for @entity149 for @entity29			1
