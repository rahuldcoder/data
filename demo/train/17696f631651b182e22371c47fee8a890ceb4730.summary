-- the recent @entity3 summit in @entity4 , @entity1 was initially meant to prepare the alliance for the @entity7 era and pooling of resources at the time of defense cuts , known in @entity3 lingua as " smart defense			1
" however , as often happens , the summit agenda was hijacked by more current and dramatic developments : the rise of @entity17 in @entity18 and @entity20 's push into @entity21			1
both these developments have reminded @entity3 that its core business -- the defense of its member states -- needs to be returned to the center of the alliance 's agenda			2
@entity20 's annexation of @entity30 and continued push into the south - east of @entity21 -- a @entity3 partner country -- has inevitably provoked fear amongst @entity21 's neighbors , all of whom have relatively fresh memories of @entity20 domination			1
these countries -- @entity40 and the @entity41 in particular -- made sure that the @entity21 crisis would be at the center of the @entity4 agenda			2
this happened in two ways			0
the @entity47 allies asked for measures that would reassure them by confirming @entity3 's engagement in the face of @entity20 aggression			1
in addition , the show of solidarity with @entity21 became a major focus of the summit , which was attended by @entity21 president @entity58			2
the outcome of the @entity4 summit has met these allies ' expectations , at best , halfway			0
the biggest change came in the rhetoric and positioning of the alliance 's key members			2
until very recently , @entity3 has prioritized its partnership with @entity20 , taking great care not to offend it			1
when in 1997 the @entity70 started the process of taking in new members from @entity47 and @entity73 , it mollified @entity74 by setting up a separate @entity75 and signing a partnership agreement that excluded the presence of a major @entity79 force in new member states			0
@entity20 's actions in @entity21 have made the pretense of partnership ridiculous and as much was acknowledged by @entity3 states in @entity4			1
on his way to the summit , @entity86 president @entity85 paid a visit to @entity90 where he delivered a reaganesque speech pledging full solidarity with the @entity41			0
meantime @entity94 chancellor @entity93 condemned @entity20 aggression in @entity21 and reasserted the viability of @entity3 's collective defense measures			1
overall , the rhetoric of partnership with @entity20 -- which has dominated past meetings -- disappeared in @entity4 where it was replaced by the rhetoric of facing - up to an adversarial @entity20			1
however , whilst @entity3 leaders were strong in words , the decisions they took in response to the @entity20 threat were at best modest			2
at the height of crisis during the @entity112 the @entity86 presence in @entity109 reached more than 277,000 troops			0
by comparison the @entity86 said earlier this month that it had 57,000 active service members in @entity73			0
of these only a very small number are based in @entity40 and the @entity41			0
decisions taken in @entity4 have not changing these facts in a meaningful way			0
whilst @entity3 announced a creation of a spearhead force , consisting of a @entity124 , frequent exercises and logistical centers , this initiative will not change the strategic balance in @entity47 and @entity73			2
the units contributing to the rapid - reaction force will remain within the states that designate them , meaning their availability will be subject to political approval			0
the exercises that would bring together @entity86 and @entity47 troops are meant to be frequent or even " persistent " but their scope will remain small			0
the logistical centers that are meant to be based in @entity40 and the @entity41 states are perhaps the most concrete of the approved measures			0
if developed they would commence integrating @entity47 and @entity73 into the @entity3 infrastructure			0
overall , the reassurance measures for @entity143 and @entity73 are not game - changers , but they are going in the right direction and could suggest a beginning of rebalancing of the current vastly unequal situation in the region			0
however , as far as @entity21 itself is concerned the summit offered @entity152 close to nothing			2
the announcement that @entity3 would spend 15 million euros ( $ 19m ) on military aid to @entity21 did not impress the @entity21 nor the @entity20			1
@entity3 's decision to allow individual members of the alliance to sell arms to @entity21 has not changed anything , not least because since then a number of states have rushed to deny they intended to sell anything to @entity21 whilst the unstable situation there continues			1
in other words , after the summit @entity21 continues to be on its own vis - a - vis belligerent @entity20			1
@entity3 's failure to send a clear signal to @entity20 by supporting @entity21 represents in itself a grave threat to the alliance 's @entity173 @entity47 members -- who may be next on the list of potential @entity20 targets .			1

a @entity3 summit in @entity1 last week took place amid crises in @entity18 and @entity21
@entity21 's neighbors ensured its conflict was on the agenda , @entity182 says
past rhetoric of partnership with @entity20 was replaced by talk of facing an adversary , he says
but in the end , @entity182 says , the summit gave @entity21 little to combat a belligerent @entity20
