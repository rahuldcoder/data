the three - time world player of the year paid the ultimate tribute to @entity12 in the coach 's final home game , which ended in a 4 - 0 victory over city rivals @entity16			1
the @entity17 forward went into the match having already broken @entity20 's longstanding record of 67 goals in a @entity23 season , and he took his tally to an incredible 72 ahead of next weekend 's closing league game at @entity25			1
fifty of those have come in @entity8 , putting him five clear of @entity6 -- who also scored in saturday 's 2 - 1 win at @entity30 that kept real seven points clear of @entity4			1

@entity6 , who topped the @entity8 scoring charts last season with a then record 40 goals , was also on target from the spot as @entity1 came from behind to snatch victory			1
@entity30 , battling to avoid relegation , led through @entity62 in the fifth minute , but the world 's most expensive player leveled in the 81st minute after being brought down in the box			0
then , in time added on , @entity66 diverted @entity69 's cross into his own net to give @entity25 the chance to finish the season on 100 points with victory next sunday			2
@entity74 guaranteed third place -- 29 points behind @entity4 -- with a 1 - 0 win over @entity78 , who face a final - day fight to avoid dropping into the bottom three			0

@entity90 and @entity91 are another point back after the latter side won their clash 1 - 0			0
second - bottom @entity95 could still survive after a 2 - 1 win over @entity25 left the club three points adrift of @entity100 and @entity101 .			0
