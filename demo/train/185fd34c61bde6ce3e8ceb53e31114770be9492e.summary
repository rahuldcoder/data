@entity7 hours after @entity2 attorney general @entity1 began raising money for a bid to replace @entity5 in the @entity6 , billionaire environmentalist @entity0 outlined the case for his own run tuesday and said he would decide soon -- setting up the likelihood of an exorbitantly expensive contest that could have two democrats facing off in november of 2016			1
@entity2 's two @entity6 seats have been locked down by @entity5 and @entity16 sen. @entity15 since 1992 , closing off statewide opportunities for the next generation of politicians			1
under @entity2 's new top - two primary system , the top two candidates in the first round will advance to the general election , regardless of their party			1
in a column on the @entity27 website , @entity0 said he was intrigued by the opportunity of taking on interests in @entity30 that " oppose recognizing global warming and fight against the rights and futures of average @entity16			0
" " @entity30 needs to be shaken up and we need climate champions who will fight for the next generation , " @entity0 said			0
" @entity2 @entity13 are blessed to have a deep bench of talent , and i will decide soon based on what i think is the best way to continue the hard work we have already started together to prevent climate disaster and preserve @entity16 prosperity			0
" @entity0 and @entity46 would be among the most formidable contenders for @entity5 's seat , along with former @entity7 mayor @entity49 , who has said he is " seriously considering " a run			1
several members of the @entity2 congressional delegation and of the state leadership have signaled interest , including rep. @entity55 , rep. @entity56 , and state treasurer @entity57			0
in a @entity59 post on tuesday , @entity55 touted her focus on working families , immigration reform and affordable healthcare : " i have advocated for policies that give all families the same access to the @entity67 , " she said			0
" californians deserve a strong voice in @entity30 and i have never been afraid to speak up , which is why i am seriously considering running for the @entity6 in 2016			0
" but lesser - known candidates could face great difficulty raising the money needed to run			2
@entity5 raised some $ 35 million in conjunction with party committees for her 2010 race against former @entity78 chief executive @entity77			2
@entity0 , a former hedge fund manager from @entity79 whose net worth has been estimated at $ 1.6 billion by @entity81 , has pledged to give away the bulk of his fortune to public interest and philanthropic causes during his lifetime			0
he has been a vocal opponent of the @entity87 and a free - spending advocate for @entity2 environmental causes			0
his @entity90 spent more than $ 74 million in the midterm elections -- much of it @entity0 's money -- trying to defeat candidates who had expressed doubt about climate change , but they had little demonstrable success in a @entity99 wave year			2
as a candidate , @entity0 's investments throughout his business career are also likely to come under uncomfortable scrutiny			2
last year , for example , the @entity104 examined lucrative investments by @entity0 's former fund , @entity108 in companies across the globe that own coal - fired power plants			2
@entity46 , the former district attorney of @entity79 who was just re-elected to her second term as attorney general , was the first to formally declare her candidacy since @entity5 announced last week that she would not run for re-election in 2016			1
while @entity49 could build a strong @entity2 base , and draw on his support from @entity2 's growing @entity121 community , @entity46 also has a solid fundraising base in @entity2 from her two statewide runs and her close alliance with president @entity125			2
she has won praise as attorney general for pursuing banks that did not follow proper procedures when they foreclosed on the properties of @entity2 homeowners and she has kept a steady focus on reducing recidivism and truancy			1
" from my first days as a prosecutor in @entity139 , to my work as @entity79 district attorney to my current service as @entity2 attorney general , i have worked to bring smart , innovative and effective approaches to fighting crime , fighting for consumers and fighting for equal rights for all , " @entity46 said in a statement on her new campaign web page tuesday			1
" i will be a fighter for the next generation on the critical issues facing our country			0
i will be a fighter for middle class families who are feeling the pinch of stagnant wages and diminishing opportunity , " she continued			0
" i will be a fighter for our children who deserve a world - class education , and for students burdened by predatory lenders and skyrocketing tuition			0
and i will fight relentlessly to protect our coast , our immigrant communities and our seniors			0
" @entity166 passes on bid for @entity5 's seat @entity46 ' position was strengthened on monday when lt. gov. @entity166 bowed out of contention			1
speculation had swirled around the possibility of a heated race between @entity46 , 50 , and @entity166 , 47 , who could have potentially split the @entity175 vote , clearing the way for a @entity2 candidate like @entity49			1
@entity166 has told many confidantes that he is interested in running for governor when @entity180 faces term limits in 2018 , and he and @entity46 share the same political consultants			0
in a statement on his @entity59 page , @entity166 said it was better " to be candid than be coy " and noted that it would be better for his three children , @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190 , if he stayed in @entity2			2
" while i am humbled by the widespread encouragement of so many and hold in the highest esteem those who serve us in federal office , i know that my head and my heart , my young family 's future and our unfinished work all remain firmly in the state of @entity2 -- not @entity30 therefore i will not seek election to the @entity6 in 2016 , " @entity166 said			1
hinting at his potential alliance with @entity46 , he added that in the months to come , he looked " forward to doing whatever i can to help elect @entity2 's next great @entity13 senator -- one worthy of succeeding @entity5 and serving this remarkable state of dreamers and doers in the @entity6			1
" shortly after @entity5 announced that she would retire from the @entity6 in 2016 , @entity7 mayor @entity209 said he would not run for the seat .			1
