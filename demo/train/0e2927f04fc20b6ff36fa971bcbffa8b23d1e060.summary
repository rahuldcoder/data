@entity1 's attorney general said thursday that the state may have to issue a nationwide manhunt after four pardoned murderers left jail and " hit the road running			1
" " we 'll catch ' em. it 's just a matter of time , " attorney general @entity7 told @entity8			1
the four were among nearly 200 convicted criminals to whom gov. @entity14 granted clemency or a pardon in a final act before leaving office this week			1
the governor 's actions have set off a legal firestorm in @entity1			2
a judge issued a temporary injunction wednesday forbidding the release of any more prisoners			1
and the process of releasing 21 other inmates has been halted , said @entity7 , who believes the former governor put people at risk and sought the court order			1
the pardons include the four convicted murderers and a convicted armed robber who were released sunday			1
the five now must contact prison officials on a daily basis as their fate is adjudicated , but their whereabouts are unknown , @entity7 said			2
a court hearing on the matter will be held january 23			2
@entity7 said the state can not issue an arrest warrant for the five who were released because they have not committed a crime			2
" we have not found any law that will support that , " @entity7 told @entity8			2
" they have a legal document saying they are free to go			0
" there are some tough legal issues we are trying to address , " he said			0
" this is such a unique problem that no law has ever had to address yet			0
we 're having to make new law here			0
" @entity7 said he did not know @entity14 's reasons for the pardons and clemencies , but said he owed the public an explanation			1
he gave the governor a tongue - lashing , comparing him to the unethical , greedy commissioner in the 1980s television series " @entity66			0
" " he 's tried to rule the state like @entity69 and he did n't think the law applied to him , " @entity7 told @entity8 wednesday			0
@entity7 said @entity14 violated the state 's constitution because the pardon requests for many inmates were not published 30 days before they were granted , as required			1
@entity1 is one of the few states that requires advance notice			0
" this is n't a partisan issue , " according to @entity7 , who is a @entity79			0
" either you followed the constitution or you did n't			0
" @entity14 is a conservative @entity82			1
what 's behind the pardon battle ? @entity86 circuit court judge @entity85 issued the injunction wednesday , saying it appeared some pardons , including those for four murderers , did not meet the 30 - day requirement			1
any inmates released in the future must meet the standard , @entity85 ruled			2
on his way out the door , the governor approved full pardons for nearly 200 people , including 14 convicted murderers , according to documents the @entity1 secretary of state 's office released tuesday			1
the four murderers who received full pardons last week -- @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 -- were cited in @entity85 's order			1
they were all serving life sentences and worked as inmate trusties at the governor 's mansion , said @entity115 , spokeswoman for the @entity116			0
trusties are inmates who can receive additional rights through good behavior			2
@entity7 told @entity8 that it 's possible that those who did n't meet the 30 - day requirement may have to return to prison and complete their sentences			0
@entity14 said wednesday that some people misunderstand the clemency process and believe that most of the individuals were still jailed			1
" approximately 90 percent of these individuals were no longer in custody , and a majority of them had been out for years , " he said in a statement			0
" the pardons were intended to allow them to find gainful employment or acquire professional licenses as well as hunt and vote			2
my decision about clemency was based upon the recommendation of the @entity143 in more than 90 percent of the cases , " @entity14 wrote			1
" the 26 people released from custody due to clemency is just slightly more than one - tenth of 1 percent of those incarcerated			2
" @entity7 said he is questioning the release of many of the 175 individuals who received full pardons			1
the pardons are " a slap in the face to everyone in law enforcement and governor @entity14 should be ashamed , " @entity7 said			1
@entity14 's full pardon of @entity106 has intensified fears that the man will try " to finish what he started , " one of his surviving victims said			1
" i feel like my safety is in jeopardy , " @entity163 , who was shot and wounded by @entity106 , said wednesday			0
" i wonder if he 's going to finish what he 's started			0
" @entity106 walked into a trailer in 1993 where his estranged wife , @entity168 , lived and shot her in the head as she held their 6 - week - old baby in her arms			0
she died of her wounds			0
@entity163 , the woman 's friend , survived a gunshot wound to the head			0
@entity106 was convicted of murder , aggravated assault and burglary of a residence			2
in an interview with @entity8 's @entity183 , @entity163 and @entity184 -- @entity168 's sister -- expressed concerns about the release and fears that @entity106 may intend to target them			2
" i 'm married and have a family again , " @entity163 said			0
" i feel the safety for them is an issue			0
anybody that might be with me at the time that he decides to do something would be in jeopardy			0
" @entity106 's pardon also raised concerns from @entity201 , the prosecutor who saw him sent to prison			0
" @entity14 is insane for granting a pardon to this criminal , " said @entity201 , who is now in private practice			1
@entity206 said @entity14 -- who left office this week -- has n't directly responded to questions about the pardon			1
" he will not comment on anything			0
we have no answers as to why he has done this			0
i would like to think he did not have all of the facts of the case , if he did have all the facts , " she said			0
@entity14 's successor , @entity218 , was inaugurated tuesday			1
@entity14 , who served eight years in the governor 's office , had previously granted full pardons to three other convicted killers in 2008			1
another three were awarded conditional or indefinite releases during his time in office -- meaning the governor , in total , granted reprieves to 20 convicted murderers , the documents showed			1
since the conservative governor took office in 2004 , 222 people were granted clemency for a wide variety of crimes			2
those who have been granted full pardons include shoplifters , rapists , burglars and embezzlers			1
there were also a number who were found guilty of either manslaughter or homicide , who were given unconditional pardons			2
@entity14 is a long - time @entity82 operative , serving as the chairman of the @entity248 from 1993 to 1997 , working as an aide in the @entity251 administration and taking part in the 1988 presidential campaign of @entity254			1
he also is considered one of @entity257 's most - powerful lobbyists .			0
