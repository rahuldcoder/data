@entity1 , @entity0 -- they were entrusted with gold			1
the @entity5 , shown here in 1964 , left behind a wealth of material , which was carefully handled by @entity10 's engineers			1
when the @entity5 ' longtime record label , @entity10 , decided to remaster the @entity5 ' music , they gave the raw material to a handful of men			1
among them were @entity10 engineers @entity19 , the project coordinator , and @entity21			1
@entity19 , in particular , was familiar with the tapes			1
he was the person who had copied them from their original analog form to digital as a safety backup in 1991			1
he 's since worked on the @entity5 projects " live at the @entity28 , " " @entity29 " and " @entity30 ... naked			1
" @entity2 's @entity31 was given the chance to sit down with @entity19 and @entity21			1
the following is an edited and condensed version of the interview			1
for the complete interview -- including some technical details -- click here (			1
pdf file -- requires @entity40 ) @entity2 : why was this project taken and why so long ? @entity19 : it was started 4 1/2 years ago and it has taken over that period of time about a year to do the whole thing			1
on average about two weeks per album			1
explore a timeline of the @entity5 over the decades @entity2 : what does this allow you to do that you could n't have done to these songs before ? @entity19 : when they were originally transferred to @entity55 in 1986 , digital technology was in its infancy and the gap of 22 years has allowed for a great increase in that technology			1
so the transfers are far superior now and that was before we actually did any work to them			1
in addition to that , we had decided that we wanted to remove or improve technical faults within the recordings that could have been a bad edit , a dropout , vocal sibilance , vocal pops			2
things that were directly related to the technical recording rather than the human recordings , so in other words we have n't taken out breaths or little coughs or squeaky chairs or @entity81 's occasional squeaky bassdrum pedal			2
@entity2 : tell us about the process ? and that is where you came in [ @entity21 ]			2
@entity21 : the first part of the process is choosing what equipment you are going to use to do the image and the transfers			2
... and then after choosing ... everything was transferred track by track into protocols , making sure the tape heads were nice and clean and the tape speed was constantly monitored , so the best possible transfer could happen			1
then @entity100 , who did all the transfers , went in with the restoration engineer -- a guy named @entity104 -- they then looked at all the various ticks , pops , sibilance and sorted all that out			2
... that now becomes your master tape and that 's when we started , really			2
@entity2 : each [ song ] had its own challenges ? @entity21 : absolutely			2
@entity2 : what were the differences ? would it take a week on a song , six months on a song ? @entity21 : more likely four or five hours on a song			2
on average we took about two weeks per album			2
but sometimes it might be three or four hours on a song , it might be 10 minutes on a song			2
@entity2 : how much involvement was there from the @entity5 themselves ? @entity19 : they were n't involved in the process			1
obviously they have to sign off on it			2
so when we finished it , we provided them with a copy of every album			0
but the process was over such a long period of time and it would be very complicated to have involved them anyway			0
i 'd like to think they have some trust in us because we 've done numerous other jobs for @entity146			0
@entity2 : and you have n't heard back and that is good news ? @entity19 : basically , if the phone does n't ring , that is good news , yes			0
@entity2 : there always will be people who say ... you are messing with something in the original -- @entity19 : playing with the crown jewels			0
@entity2 : there probably will be a critic out there that will complain			0
@entity2 : but you are clearly pleased with your outcome ? @entity19 : yes , i think , actually before we even started work on them , by doing an [ equalization ] ... they actually sounded better and i think quite frankly , probably the closest they have sounded to the original masters , than they have done ever before			0
@entity2 : anything surprise you by going through this whole process ? @entity19 : probably the only surprise is that when i started buying the vinyl in the ' 60s , i bought stereo , so i had never heard mono , and to be honest with you it was actually quite a fascinating experience to sit and listen to , particularly " @entity183 " in mono			1
i mean , up until " @entity183 " and beyond , up to the @entity186 in fact , the monos were considered to be the real masters in the sense that in the ' 60s @entity190 was n't up to speed , we had n't quite got to stereo			0
the only people who really had stereo in those days were people who could afford it and invariably that meant they were listening to classical music or middle - of - the - road music			0
... to suddenly hear the monos , i don¹t think , in fact , i had listened to the mono " @entity183 " in all the years i have been doing @entity5 work			1
@entity2 : the press release says you took out bad edits			0
i did n't know there would have been bad edits in the original @entity5			1
@entity19 : there was n't many to be honest , i mean it was just an issue that we could deal with now			0
there were a few songs where they had created it over two takes and they wanted to use a part of one take and a part of another , and sometimes the edit was n't as good as it could be			0
in some cases we could n't do anything about it , but if we could we would try and smooth it over so it was n't so obvious			0
@entity2 : did you achieve [ what you were going for ] ? @entity19 : i think that 's up to other people to judge , is n't it			0
... it was a team effort			0
and i think that was the most important thing , one person wasn¹t involved in just doing the one thing			0
in fact it would have been ... @entity2 : awful ? @entity19 : ... it would have been unfair			0
@entity2 : was there a time pressure as well ? @entity19 : no there was no time pressure			0
there was a possibility of them coming out sooner , but we were way up anyway by that point			0
i think that when @entity10 put the press release out , we all did a double take and thought , " @entity249 , they 're coming out now			0
we can¹t do anything about it now			0
should we go back and start again ? " there was some fear and trepidation at that point			0
realizing that after four years not quite knowing when they were gon na come out , to suddenly be told " that 's it , no more time lads			1
" ireport.com : share your review of the @entity5 box sets @entity2 : and now they are ready for digital downloads if we get to that point			1

engineers spent more than four years on @entity5 *catalog* remastering
@entity273 *strived* to stay as close to originals as possible , yet clean up flaws
one of the biggest surprises : hearing the mono versions
