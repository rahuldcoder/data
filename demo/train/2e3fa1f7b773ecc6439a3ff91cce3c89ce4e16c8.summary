five things kill more people in the @entity2 than anything else : heart disease , cancer , lung disease such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis , stroke and unintentional injuries such as those on roads or caused by medication overdoses			1
together , these five conditions cause almost two - thirds of all deaths in the country -- nearly 900,000 each year			1
on thursday , the @entity17 is releasing its first report on potentially preventable deaths from those causes in each one of the 50 states			1
the data suggest we could prevent at least a third of those deaths			1
we already know how to do it -- now we need to act on what we know			2
whether it 's by investing resources , using proven strategies or coordinating with health care systems , we have within our communities the strengths to help people live long and healthy lives			0
even identifying and focusing on just one issue that can be addressed in each community will make a difference			0
the greatest impact comes when we make the default choice the healthy choice -- for example , making heart - healthy actions part of the normal course of everyday life			1
@entity17 : 200,000 people die needlessly every year we can make it easier for people to be physically active , avoid tobacco and have access to affordable , healthy food			1
we can make it easier for people to get recommended clinical preventive services such as blood pressure management and cancer screening , and to have access to good quality health care when it 's needed			2
and we can make it so that our children are likely to reach adulthood without being addicted to nicotine or facing a potentially lifelong struggle with obesity			0
here are some examples of communities making a difference : in @entity71 , 44,000 children have access to safe recreational space because public school playgrounds are now open during nonschool hours			0
nearly 700,000 residents of @entity76 , @entity77 , can increase their level of physical activity because their community is improving the safety and accessibility of walking , riding bikes and using public transportation			0
these are just two examples of success stories , large and small , that make the healthy choice easy			0
the @entity90 initiative , launched by the @entity91 in 2011 , brings together communities , health systems , nonprofit organizations , federal agencies and private - sector partners to prevent heart attacks and strokes			1
@entity2 suffer 2 million heart attacks and strokes each year , which cause one in every three deaths and add more than $ 300 billion to our annual health care bill			1
million @entity90 will reduce these human and economic costs by improving care for high blood pressure and high cholesterol , helping patients quit smoking and increasing use of aspirin for those who will benefit from it			0
tobacco remains the leading preventable cause of death in this country and in the world			0
tobacco use is a major factor in four out of the five leading causes of death : heart disease , cancer , lung disease and stroke			1
it causes about a third of heart disease and cancer , and most emphysema			1
getting the last 20 % of @entity2 who still smoke to quit will make a huge difference in the length and quality of their lives			1
most people in this country who smoke started as kids , most who have ever smoked have already quit , and most current smokers want to quit			0
we know it can kill us : why people still smoke we can prevent children from starting to smoke , help motivate smokers to quit and protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke by working at federal , state and local levels to eliminate loopholes in restrictions on tobacco marketing , pricing and products , and by expanding smoke - free regulations that cover all public places and workplaces without exception			0
this kind of change requires political will , especially when faced with vocal and well - organized opponents funded by the tobacco industry			0
we 've learned from health systems around the country that big improvements can come from simple measures that focus clinical attention			0
these include effective use of electronic health records to identify and track the progress of patients who need support , team - based care and the use of protocols and prompt data feedback			2
but each year we do n't act adds tens of thousands of preventable deaths to the toll			2
we owe it to the @entity2 people to do better .			2

heart disease , cancer and lung disease are among the top five @entity2 killers
those five cause nearly two - thirds of deaths in the country
new data suggest about a third of those can be prevented
