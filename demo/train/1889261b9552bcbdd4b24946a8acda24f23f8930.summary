-- what 's better than receiving a text message ? how about a text in @entity4 ? that 's the potential of a smartphone from @entity7 , which has a large 4.3 - inch touchscreen capable of displaying three - dimensional images without the need for special glasses			1
a pair of cameras on the back allows users to take 3 - d photographs and videos			1
@entity7 is hoping its groundbreaking phone , with the hottest entertainment - focused technology on the market , will ride the @entity4 wave being pushed by @entity23 , tv networks and other creators of media content			1
the method @entity7 uses to accomplish this effect is called " switchable barrier , " which is similar to how @entity31 's @entity30 can do @entity4 without requiring the player to wear glasses			1
@entity7 showed the phone , called the @entity35 , this week at @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity38			1
the company did n't provide a release date or price , though spokespeople have said it will be affordable			0
demonstration units on display at the conference let attendees watch @entity4 movies			2
they also provided a few @entity4 games to play			0
that could pose a threat to the temporary monopoly @entity31 was poised to get on portable @entity4 gaming when its handheld game system launches in march			0
with the proliferation of @entity55 in the market , the @entity35 could help people begin shooting and archiving cutting - edge family pictures and home videos			2
the phone can hook up to a @entity62 with a cable to display media on the big screen			0
@entity7 's @entity66 , a tablet that runs @entity70 's @entity69 3.0 software and is slated for a march release , can also capture @entity4 pictures and video			1
the tablet ca n't display @entity4 on its screen , but like the phone , the @entity66 can be connected to a @entity62 set			0
the @entity35 has caused quite a stir this week at @entity36			0
however , so far it offers no spinning @entity4 text messages or eye - popping dial pads , meaning @entity69 app developers have a new mission to fulfill .			2

@entity7 's @entity35 can show 3 - d images without the need for special glasses
the smartphone can also shoot pictures and video in @entity4 using a pair of cameras
@entity35 runs @entity70 's @entity69 software and was *unveiled* at a tech show in @entity38
