editor 's note : @entity2 holds the @entity4 chair in @entity5 and international affairs at @entity7			1
his most recent book is " the @entity9 : why @entity10 went @entity11			0
" this is the first of two pieces by @entity2 on the @entity15 election			1
@entity2 says @entity15 's president is vulnerable on the economy and broken promises of women 's rights			1
( @entity20 ) -- in @entity15 , as in every country , all politics is local			1
while there exist few substantive differences among leading presidential contenders over foreign and nuclear policy , there are divisions over the economy			2
with uncertain and declining oil revenues and a global financial crisis , @entity15 has fallen on hard times			2
the nation suffers from high inflation and an unemployment rate that tops 30 percent ( according to unofficial figures ) -- one of the highest in the region , despite the country 's huge oil exports			2
public discontent over the faltering economy has seen president @entity43 become increasingly unpopular			2
his reformist and conservative opponents alike have criticized him publicly for spending too much time agitating the @entity45 and @entity46 and not enough trying to fix the crumbling economy			0
regardless of which candidate wins on june 12 or in a potential runoff , he will inherit a grave economic crisis and a restive population			0
dealing with foreign affairs is likely to be some way down his list of priorities			0
at his first press conference after announcing his presidential candidacy , @entity59 , @entity43 's main opponent , pledged to increase freedoms for @entity15 and curb controversial restrictions that require women to cover their hair in public			1
" can a security patrol save our youths ? " @entity59 said of the increase in the moral police operations to prevent women from allowing their hair to show in public			0
" or can they be saved by the words of a grandfather who talks to his granddaughter ? " he asked rhetorically			0
the patrols began after @entity43 became president , though his government denies responsibility ; many women claim that his administration has institutionalized discrimination against them			2
criticizing the president 's rhetoric and the strictures he has imposed on daily life and public discourse , @entity59 , who appeals to the youth vote and women , said social controls are the domain of the people , not the government -- a radical departure from the dominant orthodoxy of the ruling mullahs			2
@entity59 frames his reforms as an affirmation of @entity15 's constitution , which he says has been " violated and undermined " by @entity43			1
the reason for his rhetoric is that women and young voters could tip the balance of power in his favor			2
half of the 46 million eligible voters are women			0
in 1997 , more than 60 percent of the votes that brought former president @entity112 to power were cast by women , and in 2000 women voters were instrumental in giving reformists a sweeping majority in the parliament			0
promising greater individual freedoms to @entity15 's young people was instrumental in the two landslide victories by @entity112 in 1997 and 2001			1
ironically , during the 2005 presidential election , candidate @entity43 said he would loosen state control over people 's personal affairs			1
trying to garner support among women and young voters , in one of his pre-election television interviews he questioned the role of the morality police : " let our children arrange their hair any way they wish			0
it does not concern you and me			0
... the government should fix the economy of the nation and improve its atmosphere			0
... people have variegated tastes			0
" his broken promises to women voters could cost him the presidency on june 12			1
a reformist woman and a former member of parliament said in a newspaper article that the president 's days are numbered : " the women 's movement in @entity15 is gaining momentum and these elections may be the first step towards @entity43 [ being ] forced out			1
" indeed , women have become critical players in @entity15 's electoral map			1
more women activists are making their voices and demands heard and have formed coalitions to defeat the incumbent			0
almost 600 women have registered for the forthcoming 290 - seat @entity166 ( parliamentary ) election , which will be crucial in determining the future of the ultra-conservatives who broadly back @entity43			1
there are currently only two women in secondary @entity174 positions and 11 in parliament , but these numbers seem certain to rise			0
it is no wonder then that leading reformist contenders have appealed to women by pledging to give them a greater say in the political and social order			0
@entity184 , a former parliament speaker , said he has always supported women 's rights and that if elected , he would appoint a female minister to his cabinet : " having a female minister will make no major changes , but it will be a major step toward removing the obstacles to the active participation of women in @entity15 's politics			1
" so although this month 's presidential election is unlikely to cause a rupture internationally , either for better or worse , the result could have a critical impact on the domestic arena in @entity15 , particularly in terms of the empowerment of women			1
as such , the election will provide a glimpse of how far @entity15 has evolved and how far it has to travel			2
regardless of who emerges victorious , neither @entity15 's foreign policy nor its geostrategic posture will dramatically change			1
although the president is the human face and representative of the @entity213 - based regime in @entity214 , he is not the top executive decision - maker or commander - in - chief			0
he does not make decisions of war and peace			0
rather , his authority lies in the domestic arena , particularly in managing the economy and framing the moral debate , and communicating @entity15 's message ( s ) to the world			1
ireport.com : human chain in support of @entity59 the most powerful and influential man in today 's @entity15 is the unelected @entity230 , ayatollah @entity231 , assisted by a @entity232 that includes dozens of political leaders			2
together they are responsible for constructing the country 's regional and foreign policies , including the nuclear portfolio and relations with @entity240 powers			0
they set the broad parameters of @entity15 foreign policy and strategy , leaving the president with a limited ability to maneuver in determining the country 's international relations			1
nevertheless , the president 's personality and discourse play an important role in @entity15 's foreign relations , either heightening tensions with the world or presenting a more accommodating stance -- as clearly shown by the contrasting styles of president @entity43 and his predecessor @entity112			1
while @entity43 's aggressive rhetoric has caused a further rupture with @entity240 states , @entity112 's stress on civilizational dialogue and co-existence was warmly welcomed in @entity267 capitals and many @entity45 circles			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : @entity15 election likely to turn on local issues , not foreign policy
@entity15 's economy in trouble *due* to lower oil prices , inflation , *joblessness* , he says
women think @entity43 has broken his promises to them , @entity2 says
@entity2 : women and young people have been *key* *factors* in past votes
