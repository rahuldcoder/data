-- after a weeklong campaign by a coalition of more than 100 women 's groups , @entity1 announced tuesday that it would update its guidelines and moderator training to crack down on gender - based hate speech			1
this commitment , though only a prelude to effective and consistent implementation , marks a watershed moment in the cultural evolution of the billion - user - strong social media platform -- and perhaps even of the entire internet			0
the activist campaign spotlighted a proliferation of content glorifying rape and other violence against women on @entity1			1
groups and images with allegedly humorous titles like " raping a pregnant b * * * h and @entity27 " have always been only a click away and , under @entity1 's content policy until now , stood a better chance of surviving moderator review than photos of breastfeeding babies did			1
some have criticized the activist campaign as an attack on free speech , but free speech here is a red herring at best			0
@entity1 is a private enterprise , and the @entity42 quite simply is not the issue			1
like any private online service , @entity1 also has a right to set terms of use and a responsibility to shareholders to meet users ' needs			2
some 60,000 tweets to the campaign 's # fbrape hashtag made clear that violently misogynistic content was doing damage to @entity1 's relationship with its user base			2
@entity1 makes thousands of decisions a day about what sort of content is acceptable on its site			2
@entity62 , one of the founders of this month 's campaign along with activist groups @entity66 and the @entity67 and @entity68 , told me that @entity1 's moderation of ads or content like breastfeeding photos " put them in a position of interpreting this content and deciding what would stay up and what would not			2
... it became evident that there was a double standard when it came to gender			0
" viewed in that light , @entity1 's response to the activist campaign signals not a radical change of agenda but rather a refinement to its existing content policies			0
yet its significance for women ca n't be overstated			0
the acceptability of speech glorifying sexual or other violence against women is a sure measure of the degree to which women 's full participation -- on a website , in any public space or in a society -- is welcome			1
@entity1 is to be commended for committing to take additional steps to ensure that women are as welcome on its service as men			0
@entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and the rest would do well to follow in @entity1 's footsteps			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity113 .			0

it 's no @entity42 issue , she says ; it 's about terms of use , shareholders
