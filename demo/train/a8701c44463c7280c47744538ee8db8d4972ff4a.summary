@entity0 , @entity1 -- the fate of @entity1 's newly revised election law again hinges on the approval of the country 's @entity7 vice president , who is under pressure to sign the much - contested plan			1
the new bill has been approved by the other two members of the presidency council			0
@entity14 , the country 's @entity15 vice president , issued a statement thursday saying he and president @entity18 , who is @entity19 , have put their signatures on it			0
but @entity23 , the country 's @entity7 vice president , who vetoed the original election bill last week , continues to threaten to veto this revised measure , and @entity14 and @entity18 are trying to persuade him to sign the document			1
@entity29 's vote is key because in @entity1 , legislation passed by the parliament must be ratified unanimously by the presidency council , made up of the country 's two vice presidents and the president			1
" all the efforts are devoted to have the entire presidency council approval on the the law , coming from the joint concern about elections to take place in the specified date , " @entity14 said in a statement			0
but @entity23 said wednesday that the " veto is still an option and it will be used if i find that the current law does n't conform to the [ @entity1 ] justice and the constitution			2
" the upcoming parliamentary elections and a law setting down rules for elections are seen as important barometers of @entity1 progress toward stability			0
the election is also key step in plans for a @entity56 withdrawal from @entity1 , about 115,000 @entity56 troops remain in @entity1 , and the @entity62 administration plans to pull all but 30,000 to 50,000 of them out of the country by august			0
@entity29 vetoed the @entity1 parliament 's first election law last week , arguing it failed to provide enough seats for @entity1 refugees , many of whom are @entity7			1
a revised bill passed by @entity1 's parliament on monday remains " unconstitutional and unfair , " @entity23 said in a statement issued by his office			1
the previous law " was more fair to @entity1 than the new law , which mr. @entity23 will deal with just like he dealt with the previous one , " the statement said			1
@entity1 's constitution calls for elections by january 31			2
disputes over how seats will be allocated in a new parliament have put the vote in jeopardy			0
lawmakers need a two - thirds majority to override a veto , but @entity1 's parliament adjourned until december 8 after passing monday 's revised bill			1
@entity1 's top electoral commission -- saying it needs 60 days to prepare for voting -- announced last week that a january vote is unlikely			1
@entity29 said the election bill is unfair to @entity1 who were forced to flee violence in their homeland , and he refused to sign it without an amendment that would increase the number of seats allocated to refugees and small political parties that could not get enough votes on a national level			1
in addition to @entity23 's objections , @entity19 leaders had threatened to boycott the upcoming vote unless provinces with heavy @entity19 populations get greater representation in the next parliament			2
the law that parliament passed monday included revisions the @entity119 had sought , but not those @entity23 demanded			2
@entity29 's office said the new law was passed without " national accordance " and outside parliament 's usual way to deal with " sensitive national legislation of this caliber			2
" " what happened constitutes a dangerous precedent that will negatively overshadow the overall political process , " the statement said			0
asked whether the political holdups in passing a law will mean a delay in the election and troop withdrawals , @entity56 gen. @entity131 told @entity2 thursday that the withdrawal schedule is not as important as getting a law			0
" their democratic process is working , and i think it 's important that they have a law that everyone will accept so we can move forward together -- that 's the most important thing			0
i believe we have enough flexibility we 'll be able to mitigate it and we 'll be able to go on and have successful elections , " said @entity131 , the top @entity56 commander in @entity1 .			0
