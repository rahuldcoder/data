@entity0 -- the @entity2 declined to intervene monday in a dispute over a public school 's refusal to allow an instrument - only version of " @entity8 " at a graduation ceremony			1
officials feared the piece would be an endorsement of religion in that limited public forum			2
without comment , the justices rejected the appeal of @entity18 , who was a high school senior in @entity19 , @entity0 , in 2006			1
by tradition , graduating members of the school 's wind ensemble could choose a piece from their repertoire to play at the june ceremony			1
they chose an arrangement of @entity28 's well - known " @entity8 , " which had been performed previously in choir recitals			2
school district officials said they feared complaints similar to those that followed the previous year 's choir performance of a vocal piece that included references to @entity36 , heaven and angels			1
" @entity8 " was banned even though the performance would have contained no lyrics			2
the school district told principals to approve only musical selections that were " purely secular in nature			1
" @entity18 and others sued , saying their free speech rights were being violated , and said their choice of the piece was made on purely artistic , not religious , grounds			1
they also cited previous examples where a limited use of religious imagery in a public setting was considered acceptable			1
such examples are @entity57 monuments in city parks and opening legislative sessions with a prayer			0
justice @entity61 publicly dissented with the high court 's rejection of the appeal			1
" when a public school purports to allow students to express themselves , it must respect the students ' free speech rights , " he said			1
" school administrators may not behave like puppet masters who create the illusion that students are engaging in personal expression when in fact the school administration is pulling the strings			2
" the high court declined to explore whether those attending a graduation ceremony constituted a " captive audience " that might feel forced to hear a religious message with which they may disagree			1
the case is @entity18 v. @entity85 ( 09 - 671 )			2
in other @entity2 action : the justices agreed to decide whether a district attorney 's office can be held liable after a former death row inmate in @entity91 said prosecutors withheld key evidence leading to his conviction			1
at issue is a federal law that can place the burden on the state with a " failure to train " standard when one of its prosecutors unconstitutionally withholds exculpatory evidence from a criminal defendant			0
then - @entity108 - area district attorney @entity107 claimed his office should not be held fully responsible after one of his staff attorneys violated long - standing , accepted procedures on handling evidence in criminal trials			1
the defendant , @entity115 , was freed from state prison after 18 years behind bars for the murder of a hotel executive			0
he came within weeks of execution before being granted a new trial			0
he was then acquitted in 2003 and won a $ 14 million judgment against the state			0
oral arguments in the appeal will be heard in the fall			2
the case is @entity115 ( 09 - 571 )			2
in another case , current and former @entity129 detainees at the military prison in @entity131 , @entity132 , lost another round at the high court			2
the justices are staying out of the latest dispute about the prisoners ' demand of a 30 - day notice before any proposed transfer from the detention center			0
the men , known as @entity144 , wanted advance notice of which country they were being sent to , fearing they could be sent to a place where they would be tortured , imprisoned or harassed about their religious beliefs			0
the @entity151 government , which says the prisoners are no longer considered " enemy combatants " or a national security threat , reiterated they would not be sent to places where they might face torture or continued imprisonment			0
many of the @entity144 released so far have been sent to the @entity161 nation of @entity162 , with others going to @entity164 or @entity165			0
the justices had previously agreed to hear the @entity144 ' broader constitutional claims over their years - long detention , but the case was tossed out as moot , since most of the men have been freed or are in the process of being freed			0
the case is @entity173 v. @entity174 ( 09 - 581 )			0
the justices also rejected a separate appeal of a @entity178 law that keeps demonstrators away from abortion clinics			0
anti-abortion activists said the restriction violates their rights of free speech and assembly			1
the law sets a " protest - free zone " of 35 feet outside clinic entrances , including driveways			1
officials call it an acceptable balance between the right of access for patients and the right of expression for those opposed to the medical procedure			0
some protesters said they have been forced onto streets to make their beliefs known and have nearly been hit by cars			0
that case is @entity204 v. @entity205 ( 09 - 592 ) .			0

in 2006 , school district *disallowed* instrument - only version of well - known song
@entity211 cited complaints about performance of other piece that included religious references
high school senior and others sued , saying free speech rights were being violated
@entity2 rejects appeal without comment ; @entity61 publicly dissents
