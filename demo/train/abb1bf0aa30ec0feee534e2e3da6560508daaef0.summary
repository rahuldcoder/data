-- it appears that technology giant @entity2 is handing out free @entity4 smartphones to @entity6 owners frustrated by reception problems			1
an account on @entity9 called @ samsungukmobile is contacting people who 've tweeted about their difficulties with the handset , asking them to submit their contact details to receive a free handset			1
one of those offered a handset was @entity17 , who told @entity0 : " my @entity6 and i have been inseparable for almost a month now , tomorrow being one month since the @entity18 launched			2
but the honeymoon period ended this week as repeated dropped calls , and a sudden unexplainable inability to make or receive calls or send texts left me disgruntled			0
" so i did what anyone else would do : i vented my frustration on @entity9			0
imagine my surprise , then , when this morning i am tweeted by @entity2 offering me a free @entity4 , their latest phone			1
too good to be true ? i decided to investigate			0
" i called a friend at @entity2 , and though she was initially sceptical , it has now been confirmed : the campaign is legit			0
@entity2 is so confident about the superiority of the @entity4 that they 're sending free ones to existing @entity6 customers so they can decide for themselves			1
" it 's an interesting and unconventional approach to marketing the device , which is powered by @entity36 2.1 and features a whopping great big 4.0 - inch amoled display			1
it 's entirely possible that @entity2 has taken a gamble that getting a few of the devices out in the wild , so that people can see and play with them , will be worth the initial outlay in terms of the effect they 'll have on sales			2
@entity47 added : " i 've been waiting for an excuse to try out an @entity36 for months , but it is yet to be seen if i can be persuaded to stray			0
" would you convert to @entity36 if the phone was offered up free ? tell us in the comments			2
update : we 've got official word from @entity2 that this is legitimate			2
a spokesperson for the company told us : " recently there has been a real increase in online activity from consumers dissatisfied with some of our competitors ' products			0
we decided to contact a cross section of individuals to offer them a free @entity4 as a replacement , as we 're confident that once people have the phone in their hands , they 'll see how impressive it is for themselves			1
