before he went missing , @entity0 had developed an obsession with the movie " @entity7 , " in which a young man leaves society to go live off the land			1
unfortunately , both stories had tragic endings			0
the body of 18 - year - old @entity0 turned up in rural @entity12 on monday , authorities say			1
it was 1,000 feet from his abandoned car , which officers found last week			2
they suspect no foul play and are investigating the death as a suicide , said @entity21 , public information officer for the @entity22			1
" @entity24 made us feel like he was ok , but he was really hurting inside , " his father , @entity23 , said tuesday			2
" it 's really important that we pay real close attention to what our kids are saying and that we remind them that we love them , because there are influences in the world that tell them otherwise			2
" @entity24 is loved by many			0
i appreciate all the help and what everyone has done			0
my instincts told me this could happen			0
i 'm trying to be strong for my community			0
" in the movie based on @entity43 's 1996 nonfiction book , a young man by the name of @entity46 disappears from society			2
over the past six months , @entity23 said , his son had shown a growing interest in the movie and possibly wanted to emulate @entity46 ' actions			0
" he 's been watching the movie a lot , " @entity0 said before his son 's body was found			1
" maybe he said , ' i want to do it			0
' that 's our theory , because he kept talking about the movie			2
" @entity0 's green @entity58 was found on a lonely road in the quiet country town of @entity61 , @entity12 , on wednesday , two days after he was supposed to start college at @entity63			1
" we still do n't know what happened , " @entity0 said , " but he was lost in the wild			1
he got in over his head , and things did n't go well			0
" he was last seen at a friend 's home in @entity71 , where he 'd been visiting			2
his father assumed he was driving back to @entity73 through @entity74 and @entity12 before he went missing			1
the teen has been a main topic of conversation in @entity61 , a logging and ranching community of about 1,300 with no traditional grocery store and no movie theater			2
people had been searching their property for him , said one resident , a longtime rancher who asked that he not be identified			0
" there 's nothing that makes sense , " he said			0
what happened to him does not seem to square with what happened in the movie			0
@entity61 is dozens of miles from the nearest wilderness area , residents say			0
" it 's 2Â½ miles from the major interstate ; it 's right in town in @entity61 , " @entity94 said of where @entity0 's car was found			1
" there are houses and people , and it 's well - populated , so if he wanted to do an ' @entity7 , ' it was n't the appropriate place			1
" @entity43 's account of @entity46 ' life has taken on an almost cult status among countless free spirits who dream of shedding the trappings of modern life and living off the land			1
" there were similarities , " @entity0 said of his son 's disappearance			1
in the book , @entity46 cut off communication with his parents and traveled to @entity121 , where he lived in a school bus before dying of starvation			0
like @entity46 , @entity0 apparently traveled with very few belongings : perhaps a small backpack and his phone , his father said			1
left behind in the @entity58 was the teen 's id card , plus a sweatshirt , blanket and jug of water , things someone might need to survive in the wilderness			1
@entity0 's camping experience was limited at best , his father said , not much more than camping once or twice			1
several reports describing travelers with an apparent interest in @entity46 and the abandoned " @entity140 " parked near @entity141 , @entity121 , outside @entity142 , have surfaced recently			0
in may , a police helicopter reportedly rescued three @entity145 men who had hiked into the wilderness looking for the bus			0
an @entity149 teen inspired by the movie reportedly went missing in @entity12 in march after telling his parents he wanted to " live in the wild			1
" in 2010 , a @entity153 woman reportedly drowned in an @entity121 river during her trek to visit the famous bus .			0
