-- tests detected low levels of radioactivity on 17 @entity6 helicopter crew members when they returned to the @entity7 after conducting disaster relief missions in @entity9 , the military said monday			2
no further contamination was detected after the crew members washed with soap and water , the @entity6 said			2
in addition , the @entity6 said the @entity16 @entity15 has temporarily repositioned its ships and planes away from the @entity20 nuclear power plant after detecting low - level contamination in the air and on its planes in the area , the @entity6 said			1
one ship was operating about 100 miles northeast of the power plant when " airborne radioactivity " was detected , the @entity6 said			1
the @entity6 's statement , however , provided some perspective , noting that the maximum potential radiation dose received by personnel when the ship passed through the area was " less than the radiation exposure received from about one month of exposure to natural background radiation from sources such as rocks , soil , and the sun. " on sunday , the @entity7 started delivering aid in the coastal regions of @entity9 's @entity43			1
crew members , in conjunction with the @entity45 , conducted 20 sorties delivering aid pallets			0

the @entity6 says washing with soap and water removed the radioactivity
the @entity16 @entity15 moves ships and planes away from the @entity20 plant
the @entity6 says " airborne radioactivity " was detected 100 miles away from the plant
