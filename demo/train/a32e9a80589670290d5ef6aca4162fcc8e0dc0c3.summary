four walls , a bed and a slop bowl			2
if prison represents physical confinement and a loss of every personal freedom , what does imprisonment of the mind feel like ? " @entity10 " according to @entity11 , a @entity12 footballer who gave up his chosen profession -- his " first love " -- because of homophobia in the game			1
in a sport infamous for macho bravado on the pitch and anti-gay chants in the terraces , @entity11 was battling an unspeakable shame			1
a promising talent , @entity11 in his youth played alongside and against future @entity12 national team stars @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			1
" to play soccer basically means to rejoice in life , " @entity11 told @entity29			1
" i never stopped playing football			2
it has always been my first love and it will remain forever			2
" but , as is the case with so many first loves , @entity11 's left him with a heartbreak which was almost too much to bear			1
the young midfielder , born and raised in @entity12 in the 1970s and 80s in the days before reunification with @entity40 in 1990 , dreamed of representing his country -- but he was living an exhausting double life			1
on the surface he was a rising football star , but beneath he was a man coming to terms with his homosexuality			2
" i hid 24 hours a day , i adjusted , " explained @entity11 , who was terrified of being " outed " in a sport which today has just one openly gay professional player in @entity48			1
" it was an almost unbearable pain , a great sacrifice , a painful price to pay to achieve my goal of becoming a professional footballer			1
" constantly hearing gay used as a curse word like s * * t , made me think , ' of course , i 'm s * * t. ' i spent 50 % of my energy trying to hide , so a maximum of 50 % of my energy was available for football			1
" i kept thinking , ' i can not do this anymore , i do n't want to			2
what is going on ? ' nobody was there to help me			2
" @entity11 's love affair with football began in 1978 , when he joined @entity12 club @entity69 at the age of seven before moving to @entity72 in 1984			1
he trained twice a day with his new team and looked capable of achieving his ambition of playing for the @entity12 national team , winning a youth championship with @entity77 in 1985			1
his reputation was growing and he was called up to @entity12 's youth team in 1986			1
@entity11 went on to make over 100 appearances for @entity77 ' senior team in the @entity12 second division			1
but rather than marking the start of his rise to the top of @entity12 football , @entity11 's spell in @entity84 proved to be the peak of a career cut short by fear , insecurity and self - loathing			1
" by my early 20s i was burned out , " he said			2
" i realized that if i became a professional footballer , i would suffer as a man			1
i chose freedom over a constructed prison			0
" talent is not enough			0
you need the will , physical fitness , good luck and a tough mentality			0
but what if you hide 24 hours a day because you are gay ? " the fear and pain robbed me of my energy because i was constantly thinking of what to say , how to act so people might think i was heterosexual			1
" when it became clear he was in the twilight of his playing career , @entity11 finally summoned the courage to open up to one of his teammates following a switch to provincial club @entity118 in 1991			1
" i told only one player , in @entity69 at the end of my career -- and precisely for this reason , " said @entity11			1
" he found it interesting that i was gay , i was one of his best friends on the team			2
" compared to other areas of society , the football profession is statistically lacking in openly gay players			1
former @entity132 national team player @entity131 recently announced he was gay on the same day he retired from the sport , while @entity135 - based @entity134 is currently the only openly " out " player in @entity48			1
@entity137 's tragic story is the last time a top - flight player has been so open			2
the @entity139 committed suicide in 1998 , aged 37 -- just eight years after announcing that he was gay			2
he had become the first Â£ 1 million black player when he joined @entity142 in 1981			2
speaking at a sports forum in @entity145 last september , @entity12 chancellor @entity143 urged gay players to feel confident enough to " come out			1
" her comments came following an article in a @entity12 magazine in which an anonymous gay @entity150 player said the fear of added media attention was the reason why he had n't announced his sexuality			1
@entity12 second division team @entity155 placed itself on the front line of football 's battle with homophobia during a match with @entity161			1
fans of the club , formerly run by openly gay president @entity164 , staged a demonstration against discrimination which included brightly - colored posters and a banner reading , " football is everything -- even gay			1
" basketballer @entity172 recently made history by becoming the first openly gay @entity175 player , while the @entity176 has drawn plaudits for its anti-homophobia work			1
fifteen years on from @entity137 's suicide , with other sports such as rugby and basketball setting a precedent and with the @entity184 reportedly closer than ever to having a homosexual player , is the beautiful game ready for a high - profile gay star ? " why not ? " replied @entity11			1
" it is a great opportunity for the football world to show now that it is ready			0
associations and clubs can come out as ' gay - friendly '			2
then players , officials , coaches , referees and so many others will follow			0
" the effects of outings gay footballers will go far beyond football			2
" after years of torment and secrecy , @entity11 's coming out proved to be a turning point			1
with new - found confidence , he was able to pursue a life away from the football pitch			0
urban has told his story in the book " @entity210 : the story of a gay footballer , " while he is also something of a life coach , consulting with organizations -- including football associations -- on issues of diversity and integration			1
" i was so glad to finally be myself and i finally knew what the years of torment had been about , " he explained			0
" with the energy and force of liberation i went on the front foot , on the offensive			0
" i work as a personal coach and diversity consultant			0
i work for organizations and i help them to appreciate the dimensions of age , ethnicity , gender , religion and even sexual orientations			0
" with a wealth of personal and professional expertise on the subject of " coming out , " @entity11 is in a unique position to offer advice to any player in a similar situation to the one he found himself in two decades ago			1
according to @entity11 , former @entity245 international rugby player @entity244 -- who told the world he was gay in 2009 -- has set out the perfect blueprint for others to follow			1
" he proceeded in stages , " @entity11 said of @entity244			1
" first he outed himself to his wife			0
then he told his coach and then two players			0
after each step he received positive feedback			0
" he was told by everyone that he was still the same person			0
this enabled him to increase his self - esteem until it was big enough to go public			0
he then got exceptionally positive feedback			0
" an openly gay football star would be a turning point not just for the sport , declares @entity11 , but also for society as a whole			1
@entity265 , he suggests , stretches into areas where attitudes towards homosexuality have so far proved difficult to change			0
" football is the only way to tackle this topic comprehensively , " he said			0
" very many people are geared towards football role models on television			0
" if world soccer stars accepted their homosexuality , young people would question having to be so rough and macho			2
" the result would be a social change that goes far beyond football			0
" urban is now comfortable with his sexuality , but he is not impervious to the homophobic barbs he often overhears in general conversation			0
" ' f * * * * , f * * * * t ' , any negative way of calling someone gay , " replies urban when asked which insults he hears			2
" i was constantly affected by insults			0
although it is not said to me directly it concerns me , even today			0
" " but today , with more self - esteem and confidence , i look at homophobia from the perspective of a personal coaches and diversity consultant			0
sometimes i have to laugh about it too , because it 's stupid and ridiculous			0
" self - esteem and confidence have helped urban to heal the wounds inflicted by his first love , football			0
he is once more besotted with the sport , playing with and against gay - friendly teams from across the globe			2
it might not be playing at a @entity309 with the @entity12 national team , but @entity11 is now back on the pitch , this time with his head held high			1
" i really wanted to play for the men 's national team , " reflected @entity11			1
" it makes me happy to have made something out of my experiences			0
" for years i could never play football in the stadium			0
i saw the grass and could not stand being a spectator rather than being down playing on the pitch			0
i had regrets , i was sad and angry			0
" after i came out i was so much more confident			0
i played football at university , in a team consisting predominantly of gay footballers against other gay teams from @entity329 , @entity330 or @entity331 and @entity332			2
" today , i play at a club in @entity334 , accepted by everyone and my teammates are proud of me , i think			0
it is a great experience to play football and to feel free , pure happiness			0
" there are certainly more boring lives than mine			0
