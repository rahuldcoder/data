-- this week , " @entity3 " season 10 winner @entity1 releases his debut album , " @entity5			1
" as one would expect , the record 's 12 songs feature his deep crooning voice paired with lyrics about new love and small town aspirations			2
fans of the teen should come away satisfied with this first effort , in that it 's pretty much what one might expect from a young musician with a gifted voice who one day found himself with a sizable record advance and access to coveted @entity23 session players			2
the 17 - year - old @entity1 is juggling his senior year of high school this fall along with promoting his album			1
so just how exactly does that work ? @entity0 spoke with @entity1 from his home in @entity29 , @entity30 , about just that as well as young love , and what drink he will walk miles to enjoy			1
@entity0 : you 're just starting your senior year in high school			1
what 's the class schedule like ? @entity1 : they did n't want me to have the first block because they did n't want me to be a distraction to kids getting to school			1
so i go in the second block and am there for the rest of the day			2
next semester 's going to be the tough one			2
i have @entity50 @entity49 and all that jazz			2
@entity0 : how 's this work : you go on the " @entity3 " tour , have amazing catering and then have to come back to cafeteria food ? @entity1 : ( @entity57 ) yeah , the catering was amazing on the tour ... i probably gained a few pounds i 'll have to run off			1
but they let us go off campus , the juniors and seniors ; we have a really big school and the cafeteria ca n't fit us all in there			0
we go out to @entity66 or @entity67 but we had @entity69 food today , @entity70 's			0
@entity0 : tell me about recording " @entity5			0
" @entity1 : oh yeah , it was a lot of fun			1
it was kind of like the traveling studio , you know			0
we started off in @entity23 and recorded a bunch of songs and once we got the tracks laid down , when i was on tour , whatever city i was in we 'd stop by a studio and they 'd bring the equipment from @entity23 and we 'd lay down some vocals and then on to the next			0
@entity0 : looking back , does the record evoke certain themes ? @entity1 : yeah , we were talking about this today , actually			1
it 's got a cool thing about love			0
not necessarily the boy - girl love or anything ; it talks about everyday love , it talks about family love with kids and parents , love with loss , love for my hometown on " @entity103			2
" it 's not necessarily one theme of love , but it 's got a lot of influences			0
it 's a cool way that i like to think of it			0
@entity0 : it 's very much rooted in what someone you 're age would be going through : summer love , figuring out girls , football games			0
@entity1 : for me , an emotion is an emotion , whether you 're 70 or 17			1
at 70 , you might have much more experience with it and know a little bit more about it , but if a 17 year old says they have a broken heart , in my eyes , they have one			1
@entity0 : and those are some of the worst kinds			0
@entity1 : oh , they 're horrible , absolutely horrible			1
@entity0 : some country records are riddled with @entity133 © s ; how do you avoid those ? @entity1 : the whole @entity136 people think about country music , you know , " drinking with the boys " it is n't country music at all			1
country music is real and talks about real - life situations and i think with this record we did that			1
there 's a song called " @entity150 " and it can talk about a college student or someone like me , where you want to get of town and go live life but then when you 're at it for awhile , you ca n't wait to get back			0
i 've been at home for maybe 10 days since february and any time i can get a chance to get home , it 's a blessing			2
@entity0 : does going into this genre after " @entity3 " give you a leg up versus other people coming out of that show that make a pop or an @entity171 record ? @entity1 : you know , i 'm not so sure exactly on that			1
but country fans are really loyal and they were really supportive of me			2
i did n't do the honky - tonk in the traditional way , but now , i 'm the newbie in country music			1
i was the " @entity3 " and all that , but now i 'm making the transition and i 'm low down the ranks			1
just like the senior in high school who becomes the freshman in college			2
i got to work hard and hopefully get my sea legs and stay around for a bit			0
@entity0 : obviously , your voice is the bread and butter			0
how do you take care of it these days ? @entity1 : on the road it was tough , singing every night and talking a lot			1
we had this thing called @entity200 that we 'd drink a lot			0
anytime i do n't have to be yellin ' or talking , i 'm trying to ease off on it			0
i 'm using it a lot and i do n't want to hurt it			0
@entity0 : you mentioned the song " @entity103 " -- it might be one of the only songs that gives a shout out to sweet tea			0
@entity1 : i think that was the only one			1
i was the guy on ' @entity3 ' that walked six miles to [ get some tea ]			1
there was a time that i was going to go to @entity218 's because that was the only place in @entity219 you could find sweet tea			0
i took a right instead of a left , and i ended up walking six miles to get some sweet tea			0
i kept thinking as i was walking " man this is a long mile			0
