-- as @entity2 continues to celebrate @entity5 's @entity4 title , things are n't going quite as well for @entity6			1
@entity6 , who owns a men 's record 17 grand slam titles , slumped to his lowest world ranking in 10 years when the new standings were released monday			1
the @entity11 dropped from third to fifth in the aftermath of his upset loss in the second round to @entity15 at @entity4 , matching the ranking he last held in june 2003 when he was n't yet a grand slam winner			1
@entity6 , a month away from his 32nd birthday , responded to the defeat by entering a pair of smaller clay court tournaments in @entity23 in a bid to reverse fortunes			1
he is sixth in the calendar - year points standings , with the top eight earning a berth at the year - end championships in @entity30			0
@entity6 will play at next week 's @entity31 in @entity32 before contesting the @entity33 in @entity34 the following week			2

" i have got a lot of great memories of the tournament in the mountains of @entity11			0
" @entity6 last played in @entity34 in 2004 , winning the event for the only time			2
he lost his first four matches there before reaching the final in 2003 a week after his maiden grand slam triumph at @entity4			1
while @entity6 frets over his drop in the rankings , man of the moment @entity5 is very much on the up			1
he has spectacularly recovered -- with the help of coach @entity54 -- from losing his first four grand slam finals and in the 2011 semifinals at @entity4 to @entity57 when he was firmly in control			1
he has now captured two of the last three grand slam tournaments he has competed in and replaced @entity6 as the world 's best grass court player , having also claimed @entity64 gold at @entity4 in 2012 and a @entity4 warm - up in @entity30 last month			1
" under pressure right now @entity5 has two majors and a gold medal , " his coach @entity54 told @entity2 newspaper the @entity68 as he reflected on @entity5 's @entity4 victory over @entity70 on sunday			1
" @entity70 is a great player , do n't get me wrong			0
he has had a phenomenal last 12 months , basically since the start of 2011 , so the rankings look at all of that			0
" [ but ] if somebody has two majors and an @entity79 , and everybody else has only one major			0
" @entity54 added , before tailing off			0
" everybody can make their own opinion on that			0
" when the @entity86 downed world @entity87 in straight sets in sunday 's final , it ended a 77 - year wait for a @entity2 men 's singles champion at tennis ' most prestigious tournament			1
@entity5 said monday that he only had one - hour of sleep after his victory -- and that he did n't want to go to sleep at all because he thought when he woke up it would all be a dream			2
the @entity97 was one of those to congratulate @entity5 and he is being tipped to receive knighthood			0
the @entity86 's last loss on grass was to @entity6 in the 2012 @entity4 final			1
" i did n't always think it was going to happen , " said @entity5 of his @entity4 conquest			1
" i did n't doubt myself so much after last year 's final			0
" it was the best i 'd recovered from a grand slam loss			2
maybe a couple of years ago when i lost in the semis to @entity57 when i was up a set , maybe a break as well or had break points , and did n't get that , that was a tough , tough one for me			0
" and @entity5 said he does n't expect his motivation to dip after his historic fortnight at @entity4			2
" i hope i do n't lose hunger -- i think i should be able to use this as motivation , " said the @entity86			0
" i know what it 's like losing in a @entity4 final , and i know what it 's like winning one			2
and it 's a lot better winning			0
" i just need to make sure i do n't get side - tracked by anything			0

after losing in the second round at @entity4 , @entity6 drops to fifth in the rankings
the 17 - time grand slam champion has n't been that low since june 2003
@entity6 , *unusually* for him , is set to play in two clay - court tournaments this month
