@entity0 -- @entity2 got a temporary reprieve from a 120 - day jail term for violating probation friday , but the actress must immediately start court - ordered community service that should keep her busy for months			1
@entity2 released from jail while @entity2 recently traveled to @entity10 to discuss acting roles , including in the upcoming " @entity13 " film , her next year could be spent in @entity0 working on @entity14 , in court and behind bars			1
@entity18 judge @entity17 sentenced @entity2 to jail and community service after deciding friday that @entity2 violated her probation when she was charged with stealing a necklace from a jewelry store in january			1
it 's the latest punishment for @entity2 in a four - year - long legal saga that started with two drunk driving convictions in 2007 , followed by three judges ordering her to jail for probation violations in the past year			1
unlike last september , when @entity2 's entry into drug rehab convinced another judge not to enforce a jail sentence for a failed drug test , a rehab stint does not appear to be an alternative this time			1
@entity2 has spent a total of eight months in rehab programs since the start of 2007 for treatment of a self - admitted substance abuse problem			1
@entity17 made it clear she thought @entity2 did not respect the previous judges who sent her to jail twice last year			1
" she thumbs her nose at the court , " @entity17 said , referring to an incident last july that was caught by a courtroom camera			0
" she walks into court with ' @entity50 ' on her fingernails			0
i do n't know what that means unless it has ' i am ' before it			0
" it would take @entity2 three months of working five days a week , eight hours a day to complete the 480 hours community service @entity17 ordered friday , along with the four - month jail sentence			1

she still has a june 3 trial date for the necklace theft charge			1
the judge said she would " give her an opportunity " by reducing the felony to a misdemeanor			0
the opportunity may be for @entity2 to accept a plea deal , something she rejected last month when she demanded a trial by jury			2
at the time , defense attorney @entity80 said she " has a strong defense and we are confident that a jury will listen to the evidence fairly and acquit her			0
" @entity17 was unimpressed with the defense presented at friday 's preliminary hearing			0
it centered on @entity89 arguing that @entity2 was " doing a million different things , " including texting , when she walked out of the jewelry store with the gold and diamond necklace she had tried on 20 minutes earlier			2
@entity2 was " more scattered than crafty , " @entity89 told the judge			0
the @entity96 : @entity2 " it 's undisputed that ms. @entity2 walked out of the store with the necklace on , " @entity89 said			2
the prosecution must show she had " specific intent to permanently deprive the store of that necklace			0
" @entity89 conceded that @entity2 " did not rush to return the necklace , " but she said it just " makes her not a very considerate or courteous person , " but not a thief			2
@entity17 did not buy the defense argument			0
" if in fact it was an accident , she could have called the store back , " @entity17 said			0
@entity0 deputy district attorney @entity113 called it a " classic garden variety theft			2

@entity2 's friday ended with her posing for her fifth mugshot at @entity68 's @entity123 , where she 's been several times before			0
