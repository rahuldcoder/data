@entity0 -- @entity3 's swipe at the @entity4 proved sunday that @entity0 can be a tough crowd to impress			1
" i slept through the whole thing , " said @entity6 , a writer who watched nature 's display of fury as it took place outside the windows of his apartment in @entity13 and gave a tepid review : " nothing			1
" " i think we 're all surprised how relatively quickly the storm blew through here and the rain stopped , " said @entity18 , a national correspondent for @entity1 , who watched the storm from the comfort of his apartment in the @entity23 section of @entity24			1
he said he saw lots of local street flooding and branches in the streets , but few uprooted trees ; during the height of the storm , people were walking on the street			1
" i even saw one or two folks taking a jog , " he said			1
" @entity41 kid you not			2
they 're not going to let anybody get in their way			2
" while the initial effects of the storm were less harsh than anticipated , officials said they were still concerned about flooding from heavy rains that could affect electrical systems and other infrastructure that is largely underground in @entity0			1
gov. @entity54 said it was not yet clear when subways , @entity58 trains and @entity60 lines would reopen			2
" the conditions are still too dangerous			2
we ca n't put people on bridges ; we ca n't put people in tunnels , " he told @entity1 affiliate @entity63			2
" once we get a full assessment , we will give people an idea of when the system will come online			2
" he praised @entity0 for taking the storm in stride			1
" when we have our darkest hours , @entity0 shine their brightest , and i think this is one of those times			2
" but the possibility of worse occurring away from the shore was weighing on @entity80 director @entity79			2
" the biggest concern , now that ( @entity3 's ) gone inland , is heavy rain , flash floods " and wind damage , he told @entity1			1
once inland , hurricanes " start falling apart pretty fast , " he said			2
" eventually , it will exit out into @entity87			2
" " overall , i think we 've gotten through this , " @entity88 , commissioner of emergency management for the city , told reporters in @entity24 , where the skies were bright			1
he said the hardest - hit areas were from @entity96 in @entity24 to the @entity98 area of @entity99			1
" we have 50,000 people without power			0
that 's pretty good in a city of this size			1
so , we did well , but we prepared well , also			0
" " nothing really that bad happened , " said @entity105 , who spent saturday night in a friend 's walkup apartment in @entity108 rather than risk getting stuck without elevator service in her 23rd - floor apartment near the financial district			1
" a lot of wind and rain			0
" lt. gen. @entity117 , a @entity1 contributor who was involved in a leadership role in the recovery efforts in @entity122 after @entity123 hit in 2005 , described sunday 's hurricane as a six out of 10 , with 10 representing @entity123			1
about 30 miles north of the city , in @entity127 's @entity126 , near the @entity128 over the @entity129 , @entity130 was out early sunday at the @entity131			1
though the bridge was shut to traffic , " the boats here are all fine , " the photographer said			0
" nobody had any problem			0
" on saturday night , he attended a hurricane party in his neighborhood to discuss the brewing storm			1
" everybody just went over how they prepared and how it was going to be a waste , " he said			0
" it turned out to be largely true			0
the media blew this all out of proportion			1
" it did not flood the 9/11 memorial site in @entity152 , as many had worried it might			0
still , the storm left quite a wake -- sending water from the @entity158 and the @entity129 over their banks for a brief period on sunday morning and into @entity0			1
the water also led officials to close for a brief time the north tube of the @entity165 , from @entity152 to @entity166			0
earlier , authorities had halted public transportation , closed bridges and tunnels and buttoned up ports , essentially locking down the city of more than 8 million people as @entity3 began to lash the city with wind and rain			1
and @entity0 mayor @entity177 urged some 370,000 people to evacuate their residences in low - lying areas			0
in the @entity183 community of @entity184 , massive berms were breached by 8 a.m. , with water pushing northward into town			0
the water yanked a lifeguard building from its foundation on the beach and streets were flooded			0
@entity177 ordered evacuations for @entity192 , including @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195			0
the mandatory evacuations , which also affected parts of @entity152 , @entity99 , @entity24 , the @entity198 and @entity199 , were a first in the city 's history , he said			1
@entity204 and @entity99 resident @entity203 , who was watching events unfold from her house three doors down from the beach wall , said she disregarded the evacuation order because she was afraid of looters			0
" you can see the waves breaking on ( the beach wall ) , " she said			0
" i was a little panicked approaching high tide , which was about 7:30 a.m. but now that the peak of high tide has passed us , i 'm not as nervous			0
the waves are just huge out there			0
" more than 905,334 people were without power in @entity0 early sunday afternoon , authorities said			0
in @entity24 , @entity224 watched in despair as the water in his shop 's basement rose to his knees			1
" way worse than i 'd expected , " he said			0
" it is absolutely horrible			0
afterwards we have to spend lot of time and money , ( and ) energy for fixing them up			0
" many in @entity0 began preparing days ago for the arrival of @entity3 , stocking up on essentials			1
by late saturday , most stores , restaurants and bars were closed			0
the bread shelves were bare early sunday at the @entity244 on @entity152 's @entity245 , according to @entity246 , who said more than 1,000 people had stopped in saturday to buy the " essentials			1
" by then , the streets were largely deserted			0
" for a city that never sleeps , it 's clearly taking a nap , " @entity246 said			2
@entity1 's @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 , and @entity262 contributed to this report .			2
