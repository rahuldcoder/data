@entity0 -- rep. @entity2 , @entity3 , responded to president @entity4 's @entity6 speech on tuesday night from the @entity7			1
here is a transcript of @entity2 's speech			1
my name is congresswoman @entity2 from @entity14 's @entity13			1
i want to thank the @entity15 and @entity17 hd for inviting me to speak this evening			1
i 'm here at their request and not to compete with the official @entity21 remarks			1
the @entity17 is a dynamic force for good in our national conversation , and it 's an honor for me to speak with you			1
two years ago , when @entity4 became our president , unemployment was 7.8 % , and our national debt stood at what seemed like a staggering $ 10.6 trillion			1
we wondered whether the president would cut spending , reduce the deficit and implement real job - creating policies			1
unfortunately , the president 's strategy for recovery was to spend a trillion dollars on a failed stimulus program , fueled by borrowed money			1
the @entity41 promised us that all the spending would keep unemployment under 8 %			1
not only did that plan fail to deliver , but within three months , the national jobless rate spiked to 9.4 %			1
it has n't been lower for 20 straight months			1
while the government grew , we lost more than 2 million jobs			2
let me show you a chart			2
here are unemployment rates over the past 10 years			2
in october of 2001 , our national unemployment rate was at 5.3 %			2
in 2008 , it was at 6.6 %			2
but just eight months after president @entity4 promised lower unemployment , that rate spiked to a staggering 10.1 %			2
today , unemployment is at 9.4 % with about 400,000 new claims every week			2
after the $ 700 billion bailout , the trillion - dollar stimulus , and the massive budget bill with over 9,000 earmarks , many of you implored @entity0 to please stop spending money that we do n't have			2
but instead of cutting , we saw an unprecedented explosion of government spending and debt			2
it was unlike anything we 've ever seen before in the history of the country			1
well , deficits were unacceptably high under president @entity77 , but they exploded under president @entity4 's direction , growing the national debt by an astounding $ 3.1 trillion			2
well , what did we buy ? instead of a leaner , smarter government , we bought a bureaucracy that now tells us which lightbulbs to buy and which may put 16,500 @entity85 agents in charge of policing president @entity4 's health care bill			0
@entity89 mandates and penalties may even force many job - creators to just stop offering health insurance altogether , unless , of course , yours is one of the more than 222 privileged companies , or unions , that 's already received a government waiver under @entity89			1
in the end , unless we fully repeal @entity89 , a nation that currently enjoys the world 's finest health care might be forced to rely on government - run coverage			1
that could have a devastating impact on our national debt for even generations to come			0
for two years , president @entity4 made promises , just like the ones we heard him make this evening , yet still we have high unemployment , devalued housing prices , and the cost of gasoline is skyrocketing			0
well , here 's a few suggestions for fixing our economy			0
the president could stop the @entity117 from imposing a job - destroying cap - and - trade system			0
the president could support a balanced budget amendment			0
the president could agree to an energy policy that increases @entity124 energy production and reduces our dependence on foreign oil			0
the president could also turn back some of the 132 regulations put in place in the last two years , many of which will cost our economy $ 100 million or more			0
and the president should repeal @entity89 and support free - market solutions , like medical malpractice reform and allowing all @entity124 to buy any health care policy they like anywhere in the @entity124			1
we need to start making things again in this country , and we can do that by reducing the tax and regulatory burden on job - creators			1
@entity124 will have the highest corporate tax rate in the world			0
look no further to see why jobs are moving overseas			0
but thanks to you , there 's reason for all of us to have hope that real spending cuts are coming , because last november , you went to the polls , and you voted out the big - spending politicians and you put in their place great men and women with a commitment to follow our @entity161 and cut the size of government			0
i believe that we 're in the very early days of a history - making turn in @entity124			1
please know how important your calls , visits and letters are to the maintenance of our liberties			1
because of you , @entity172 is responding , and we 're just beginning to start to undo the damage that 's been done the last few years , because we believe in lower taxes , we believe in a limited view of government and exceptionalism in @entity124			1
and i believe that @entity124 is the indispensable nation of the world			0
just the creation of this nation itself was a miracle			0
who can say that we wo n't see a miracle again ? the perilous battle that was fought during @entity186 at @entity187 was a battle against all odds , and yet this picture immortalizes the victory of young gis over the incursion against the @entity193			0
these six young men raising the flag came to symbolize all of @entity124 coming together to beat back a totalitarian aggressor			0
our current debt crisis we face today is different , but we still need all of us to pull together			0
but we can do this			0
we will proclaim liberty throughout the land			0
and we will do so because we , the people , will never give up on this great nation			0
so @entity204 bless you , and @entity204 bless the @entity124 .			0
