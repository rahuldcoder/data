-- another summer , another @entity2 hardware update			1
this one 's worth getting , too -- especially if you have an original @entity2 or the @entity5			1
a self - admitted tech geek , @entity6 is president of @entity9 , a blogging network			1
if you keep holding out because the @entity2 does n't have everything you want , it may be time to re-evaluate your position			1
this is n't just a phone -- it 's a mobile communications device that boasts few true rivals in the marketplace			2
instead of waiting in line at an @entity23 or @entity24 store , i simply ordered mine though @entity23 , and that process was amazingly simple			2
i was guaranteed delivery by the june 19th launch date , and indeed , my @entity30 ( black ) @entity29 was handed to me on friday morning			1
no muss , no fuss			2
before i get into the reasons i 'm in love ( love ! ? ) with the @entity29 , let me just say that the activation process on @entity24 's network was less than impressive			1
it took close to 32 hours for the sim card to activate , and @entity24 could offer little to no assistance in that process			2
they were , quite simply , overwhelmed			2
i contend that a lot of perceived @entity2 issues have more to do with @entity24 than they do with @entity23			1
even so , @entity23 saw fit to issue a $ 30 @entity45 gift card to people caught in this delay			0
now that is customer service			0
so , what else has @entity23 given the world in the @entity29 ? 1			2
with the swipe of a finger , you can record a quick video			0
with another swipe , you can trim your recording			0
with yet another swipe , you can email it or upload it to your @entity63 account			0
even when it 's transferred over @entity24 's @entity66 , the @entity65 quality is rather impressive			2
based on my first mobile @entity63 upload test , i know i 've sold a few more people on the @entity29			2
@entity23 seems to have integrated some kind of anti-shake feature into its video processing , too			0
it 's 50 percent faster than previous generations			1
yes , believe me when i say that you 'll notice a difference in speed ( in direct comparison to the @entity2 and @entity5 models )			1
if you 've never owned an @entity2 before , then you 're going to be equally as impressed			2
animations are smoother , apps launch more quickly , and ... well , the dang thing 's just faster			1
are you good with @entity84 ? would you rather have @entity30 ? either way , you 'll get what you want			0
i always say : buy as much as you can afford			0
five times the amount of usable memory			1
given that @entity90 3.0 now supports push data ( that is , it allows applications to send and receive data in the " background " ) , you 're going to want more than just 20mb available to you			0
whereas the @entity5 comes with @entity96 of memory , the @entity29 has @entity97			1
this translates into far fewer app crashes			0
press and hold the home button ( that 's the round thing at the bottom of the @entity2 ) , and you 'll be passed to the @entity106 application -- allowing you to tell your device to call a friend , play a song , and more			1
it did n't require any training for me to use , either			0
yeah , i have no idea when i 'm actually going to need this			0
more importantly , app developers will take advantage of this new feature			0
turn - by - turn navigation , anyone ? @entity121 's working on an app for that			2
i 'm not sure you could make it through an entire working day without attaching an external battery pack to your @entity2 , but @entity23 's found a balance in performance and power with the @entity29			1
they had to throttle the processor speed somewhat , slightly diminish the capability of the video processor , but at least people ca n't complain that they always have to keep ' er plugged in to an external power source			0
is n't 3 megapixels usually better than 2 ? generally , yes			0
but @entity23 also added the ability to take close - up ( macro ) shots , and an intuitive autofocus feature			0
simply tap the area on the screen you want to be in focus , then take your shot			0
and before i forget , a friend told me that if you wanted to take a picture of yourself ( with the screen facing the other direction ) , tap and hold the " snapshot " icon			0
flip the screen away and when you 're ready to shoot , simply lift your finger from the trigger			0
thanks , @entity157 ! 9			0
same form factor as the @entity5			2
why is this nice ? well , you do n't have to run out and buy new cases for your @entity2 ( if you were previously using the @entity5 )			1
if this is your first @entity2 , or you 're upgrading from the original , then you 'll still have a full range of accessories for your @entity29			1
i 'm sure a revision is in the @entity2 's future , but not this year			1
okay , this one 's a bit of a stretch , but the @entity29 has the @entity173 sensor built - in ( no receiver required )			1
maybe i can convince people that i 'm more healthy because i have the ability to track progress ? @entity178			0
still , it 's a convenience for those who use it -- i 'd just recommend a waterproof case for your @entity2 to keep it from being damaged by sweat ! admittedly , the @entity2 is n't " cheap " to own			1
but the device is only getting better with time			0
the operating system is ever - maturing and ( for the most part ) backwards - compatible with older iphones , the @entity29 's hardware specs are comparable to today 's sexiest smartphones , and @entity23 is n't going anywhere anytime soon			1
the only @entity2 killer on the market today ... is a newer iphone .			1
