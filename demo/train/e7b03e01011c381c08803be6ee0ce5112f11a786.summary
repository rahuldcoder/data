-- @entity1 faced additional sanctions from its @entity4 neighbors monday unless it agreed to allow international observers into the country to monitor an agreement to end a months - old crackdown on anti-government protesters			1
as a midnight sunday ( 5 p.m. et ) deadline passed , there was no immediate indication that @entity1 officials had responded to the ultimatum			2
@entity1 's state - run news agency said the country could withstand sanctions already imposed by the @entity4 and by neighboring @entity18 , and human rights and opposition groups said at least 22 more people were killed as the clampdown continued			1
over the weekend , @entity4 officials meeting in the @entity25 capital @entity26 responded to requests by @entity28 for some clarifications to the plan , but did not make any key changes , according to @entity25 's foreign minister , @entity32			1
ministers agreed over the weekend to freeze the assets of more top @entity1 officials , reduce flights in and out of the country by half and impose a complete ban on weapons shipments to @entity1 , a statement from the @entity4 said			1
" you saw yesterday human rights abuses , and this keeps building up , " @entity32 said over the weekend			0
" our mission is that none of these abuses continue anywhere in the @entity51 states , including @entity1			1
" he warned that the @entity1 crisis could be " internationalized " unless the government of @entity54 complies with a deal to end its clampdown on opposition			1
@entity1 agreed in november to halt all violence , release all detainees , withdraw all security forces from populated areas and allow unfettered access to the nation by journalists and @entity4 monitors -- but opposition groups say assaults by government troops and police have continued , and no monitors have been put in place			1
the @entity4 responded by announcing economic sanctions in late november			2
but @entity72 , general coordinator of the @entity74 - based @entity73 , expressed skepticism about whether the sanctions would help end @entity54 's 11 - year rule			2
" the economic sanctions by the @entity4 serve a good purpose of pressuring the @entity1 regime and weakening it , but i do n't think the @entity4 will be able to fulfill the political ambitions of the @entity1 -- and that is to topple the @entity54 regime , " @entity72 said			1
" we want to see the @entity1 file taken to the @entity86 and more immediate measures on the ground , like a no - fly zone and a buffer zone at the @entity18 border			0
" the @entity92 estimates that more than 4,000 people have died since mid-march , and the death toll continues to rise			1
the @entity95 of @entity1 , an opposition umbrella group , said 22 people had been killed sunday			1
all but one of the deaths occurred in the city of @entity101 , the scene of much of the recent unrest , the group said			0
the @entity105 - based @entity104 put the toll at 40 , including five soldiers who had defected and taken up arms against the government			0
the deaths included 26 in @entity101 , three in the suburbs of @entity28 and six in @entity112 , near the @entity18 border			0
an opposition website based in @entity112 reported clashes between military defectors and @entity1 troops on a highway			2
two defectors and an army colonel were killed , the website said			0
@entity0 could not independently confirm the accounts , since the @entity1 government has limited access to the country by international reporters			0
@entity4 sanctions already imposed in november include cutting ties with @entity1 's central bank , banning high - profile @entity1 officials from visiting @entity51 nations and freezing the assets of the @entity1 government , according to a senior league official who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media			1
in a statement issued late sunday , the state - run @entity135 said the nation would survive the sanctions being imposed on it by its neighbors			0
" although they will affect the livelihood of @entity1 citizens , @entity1 will overcome those sanctions by virtue of its strategic location and the diversity of its production sectors , " the news agency said			2
and it said @entity28 was ending a free - trade agreement with @entity18 and slapping a tariff on @entity18 goods imported into @entity1 in retaliation for sanctions @entity18 has imposed			2
the number of deaths across @entity1 has reached at least 4,000 since the crackdown began in mid-march and could be much higher , @entity156 , @entity92 high commissioner for human rights , said thursday			0
the uprising against @entity54 began in february			0
demonstrations have continued across the country , with protesters demanding his ouster and democratic elections			0
@entity0 's @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 contributed to this report .			0

@entity177 : " our mission is that none of these abuses continue anywhere , " @entity25 's @entity172 says
