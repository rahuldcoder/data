-- @entity2 videogame heroes have tamed the @entity3 , repelled alien invasions and driven the @entity5 from @entity6			0
but can they fight off " @entity7 " ? the popular mobile app hit 50 million downloads last year , and the @entity11 version made waves last week at the @entity13 here when it was nominated for the @entity15 ' prestigious game of the @entity17 award			1
" @entity7 " did n't win -- that honor went to " @entity19 " -- but it was the first time a smartphone game had broken free of the @entity22 ghetto and moved up into the big leagues			1
with a reported development cost of about $ 150,000 , the addictive fowl - flinging game is racking up ungodly profits			1
ironically , it 's quite likely that a great portion of those dollars are coming not from your mom and other casual gamers but from hard - core players more likely to get deep into @entity34 than to spend a few minutes with an @entity36 time - waster			1
at the annual confab of game executives , eye - opening stats outlined the evolving habits of hard - core gamers , who are spending a surprising amount of time playing games on smartphones and tablets			1
wired : videogames need auteurs , but good luck finding them @entity52 , an analyst with the @entity53 , said game console owners spend more time playing mobile games than do those in the general population			1
and 38 percent of people who play social networking games like " @entity61 " are " established console gamers , " she said			1
" is there anybody in this room who really thought they would have been spending a lot of time playing social network games ? " @entity70 asked the audience			1
the surprising popularity of casual games among even the hardest of the hard - core foreshadows a sea change for an industry that over the years has grown to resemble @entity77 , complete with star directors , creaking franchises and budgets that dwarf the annual operating costs of a small city			1
as indie and casual titles lure gamers away from powerful consoles , some big gamemakers are scrambling to imitate the success of @entity90 and @entity36 games			1
@entity93 boss @entity92 's assertion that the gaming industry is " standing on a burning oil platform " kept coming up at @entity13			2
the metaphor is clear : stand still and it 's certain death ; jump into the chilly waters and you just might live			0
everyone seems to agree that it 's time to jump			2
but nobody quite knows what direction to swim			0
" i think it 's going to be crazy in the next few years , " said @entity106 ceo @entity105 in his @entity13 keynote			0
" a lot of existing [ industry ] players are going to have to adapt in order to survive and to thrive			0
" the social blockbuster @entity114 , vice president of @entity116 ' mobile business , said that contrary to the popular belief that mobile games are played in brief bursts while on the go , about half of all mobile game time is spent at home			1
by porting hard - core titles like survival - horror game " @entity127 " to @entity126 , @entity116 is pursuing @entity128 and @entity130 owners who would rather sit on their couch and play with their @entity11 instead			1
" i do n't think it 's all about us quitting our jobs and making ' @entity7 ' and ' @entity61 ' clones , " said @entity132 , managing director of @entity133 and producer of " @entity135 , " in an interview with @entity137			1
@entity132 , who referenced @entity92 's dire predictions in her own @entity13 speech , said she wants any new gaming franchise created by her company to include robust social features that connect gamers with friends			0
wired : when game developers go @entity153 , everybody wins games should n't be the water - cooler discussion topic but the water cooler itself , the hub around which socialization occurs , she said			1
that 's already the case with " @entity61 , " but not with the type of $ 60 blu - ray games that directors like @entity132 create			1
she pointed to rival @entity168 's " call of duty : @entity169 , " which allows players to bet in - game currency on the outcomes of online matches , as an interesting example of how to build a better blockbuster			0
" the whole wager system ... adds a whole new dimension to multiplayer gameplay , " she said			0
both @entity133 and @entity116 have made efforts at pushing their big game franchises onto @entity90 , hoping that snagging social gamers and getting them interested in the series will get them to spend big bucks on the blockbusters			1
@entity133 rolled out a @entity90 game for " @entity135 , " while @entity116 crafted a social game based on its upcoming role - playing game " @entity188 " besides mixing social features into big games , publishers are likely to pursue core gamers who 'd rather play on mobile devices			1
@entity116 's @entity194 says the success of complex @entity11 games like " @entity127 " and @entity198 's " @entity197 " show that many traditional gamers are getting sucked in by robust , console - style content sold at a cheaper price on mobile platforms			1
end of the cycle with " @entity135 , " @entity133 's @entity132 oversaw the launch of the biggest new game franchise of the era , one that has sold 19 million copies since 2007			0
but she 's conscious of the fact that the game market is getting squeezed at the top			0
" to be one of those big blockbusters that 's really profitable is very hard , " she said			2
" you have to be in the top five			0
" wired : farm wars -- how @entity90 games harvest big bucks not the best odds			2
@entity132 's plan to integrate social features into her games a la " @entity225 " seems to be a push to get into that top tier again			0
but for all but the biggest publishers , the top may not be worth shooting for anymore			0
@entity231 , a game design consultant and creator of classics like " @entity235 " and " @entity236 , " said in his dice speech that the future of $ 50 million blockbuster games is " looking a little shaky			2
" if @entity132 's math is right , @entity231 is understating the situation			0
" there are n't many of these high - budget games , " he said			2
only about 60 games sold more than 1 million units last year , according to @entity231 , and a game produced on a relatively thrifty $ 20 million budget has a much better chance of being profitable in that environment			2
but he 's not sure publishers can staunch the spending spree			0
" there 's no intrinsic value to a $ 50 million game , " @entity231 said			0
he likened the situation to @entity77 , where the cost of making summer tent - pole films has spiraled upward in the last decade			2
" @entity263 " was widely mocked for its $ 175 million budget in 1995 , but that kind of money is routinely spent on big films today			1
the trouble , @entity231 said , is that the games industry has learned how to spend big gobs of money just like those movie moguls			1
" in 1994 , if someone had given me $ 20 million , i would have had no idea how to spend it , " he said , but game teams have become bloated with superspecialized jobs these days			2
to pare these groups back to only the essential members would be a daunting task , he said , but there 's a silver lining : the rapid advance of game console technology seems to have slowed down			0
new game machines wo n't materialize for a while , and anything that comes out probably wo n't be as radical a leap in power as @entity128 and @entity130 were over the previous generation of consoles			0
" we can take time now to learn our craft , " said @entity231			0
" to learn what is important to spend money on , and what is n't			2
