@entity0 -- relatives of vanished @entity4 passengers wailed and yelled in a @entity0 hotel thursday as the airline announced it was closing the assistance centers where they 'd been gathered for weeks -- effectively telling the families to go home			1
the closures also will mean no more mass daily briefings for the relatives -- news that sparked a new wave of anguish and despair for the hundreds who heard it at @entity0 's @entity20			1
" what can we do ? " a relative yelled , as others kneeled in front of police who had assembled in the hotel briefing room to keep order			0
" who will find our family members ? " another shouted			0
the airline said the center at the @entity20 , where the company has hosted families since march , would close friday			0
centers elsewhere will close by may 7 , it said			1
" instead of staying in hotels , the families of @entity4 are advised to receive information updates on the progress of the search and investigation and other support by @entity46 within the comfort of their own homes , with the support and care of their families and friends , " the airline said in a news release			1
the briefing at the @entity20 came on the day that the @entity56 government released its preliminary report on the plane 's march 8 disappearance			0
the hotel has been an important hub of information for relatives in @entity64			2
more than 100 passengers on the plane are @entity64			0
the airline said it would open different " family support centers " in @entity0 and @entity56 's capital ; it was n't immediately clear what those centers would do			1
' people started to break down ' @entity73 , the @entity74 partner of flight 370 passenger @entity75 , said she was one of about 500 people at thursday 's @entity20 meeting			0
the briefing began with the airline 's ceo making a seven - minute statement in @entity82 by video , @entity73 said			2
most of the relatives did n't understand the message until a @entity64 translation was given afterward , she said			1
" that 's when people started to break down , " she said			0
@entity73 said she left the room , saying the scene started to feel tense			0
" i could hear a lot of yelling			0
some of the police officers that were outside went in , and they started to file family members out through a separate exit , " she told @entity1 's " @entity98			2
" @entity99 was restored when @entity64 officials continued the briefing and ensured the families that the search would continue , and that the relatives would n't be forgotten , a @entity1 crew outside the briefing room reported			1
@entity73 said @entity64 relatives previously told her they dreaded the day that the hotel centers would close , fearing they would n't get timely updates at their rural homes			1
" they are very distraught , because the average @entity64 family member will be sent home to mostly a very rural place with limited access to ( the ) @entity116 , and they just feel like all lines of communications will be cut , " she said			2
airline to begin compensation payments the airline also said thursday it would begin making advance compensation to the @entity4 passengers ' next of kin , to help with their immediate economic needs			0
under an international treaty known as the @entity129 , the airline must pay relatives of each deceased passenger an initial sum of around $ 150,000 to $ 175,000			2
relatives of victims can also sue for further damages			2
the airline did n't say how much of an advance the families would receive			2
" such advanced payments will not affect the rights of the next - of - kin to claim compensation according to the law at a later stage , and will be calculated as part of the final compensation , " the airline 's news release said			1
report : four - hour gap before official search began the news of the hotel center closures came on the day the @entity56 government publicly released the initial report on the plane 's disappearance -- the report that it initially sent to the to the @entity158 , the @entity160 body for global aviation			1
the report said officials apparently did n't notice for 17 minutes that the flight had gone off radar -- and did n't activate an official rescue operation for four hours			2
relatives told @entity1 that @entity56 authorities e-mailed the interim report -- which contained both text and audio -- late thursday			1
meanwhile , the @entity172 undertook what was one of its longest , most extensive missions to search the depths of the southern @entity177 for signs of the missing aircraft			2
@entity180 , deputy supervisor of salvage and diving for the @entity183 , said the submersible 's 17th mission lasted 27 hours and descended to 5,000 meters			1
" it was a pretty successful mission in terms of what they covered , " @entity180 said			2
the @entity183 official noted that @entity192 's government has asked the @entity183 to extend its role in the search by a week or more -- a request that is under review			2
the @entity172 later moved onto its 18th mission , after which -- assuming no wreckage is found -- it should return to port on its host ship , the @entity200 , to refuel , according to @entity180			1
@entity201 defends @entity203 claim meanwhile , the private company that says it may have found plane wreckage in the @entity203 defended its claim , even though it would n't detail the technology it used			1
@entity201 said it used spectral analysis from satellite and plane images to reach its conclusion about the @entity203 site			1
the company said it conducted " large scale remote sensing " and detected the presence of aluminum , titanium and copper			0
scientists went back to test for other elements that the company says make up a commercial jet			0
@entity201 has faced questions about how it could have found wreckage deep underwater , thousands of miles from the official search area			1
" what we say to those people is that that is not about technology , that is about the fact that an object or a combination of objects which produce exactly the same signal as materials used in a plane are detected , " @entity201 managing director @entity236 told @entity1 's @entity237			1
the company said its search was self - funded and it wants to keep intellectual property private			1
" our technology comprises of 20 different technologies , and a lot of it is very valuable intellectual property , " director @entity247 said			2
" and we are not in the business of just giving out intellectual property for nothing			0
" analyst : experts do n't support claim the company said its analysis was done by a team of its scientists in @entity262			1
but @entity201 declined to name the scientists or the country they worked in and declined to give a reason			1
@entity1 aviation expert @entity266 said @entity201 's claims are not supported by experts			1
" my blood is boiling , " he told @entity1 's " @entity98			0
" " i 've talked to the leading experts in satellite imaging capability at @entity273 , and they know of no technology that is capable of doing this			0
i am just horrified that a company would use this event to gain attention like this			0
" nevertheless , the company got its wish wednesday , when @entity282 sent two navy vessels into the @entity203 to the location cited by @entity201			1
the chief coordinator of the international search effort , @entity192 @entity285 , held out little optimism that any such search would prove fruitful			0
he told @entity289 that the search area in the @entity177 had been set based on pings believed to have come from one or both of the plane 's voice and data recorders			1
" the advice from the experts is that 's probably where the aircraft lost power and , somewhere close to that , it probably entered the water , " he said			0
but some aviation experts said officials have little choice but to look into the company 's claim			0
" the investigators are going to be hard - pressed to blow this off , " said @entity308 , a former inspector general for the @entity74 @entity309			0
" i think at this point , because of the lack of results where they 've been searching for six weeks , they 're almost stuck			0
they have to go look			0
" searchers dispute company 's claim that it may have found aircraft wreckage is @entity201 on to something ? plane audio recording played for first time to @entity64 families @entity1 's @entity325 reported from @entity0			1
@entity1 's @entity326 and @entity327 wrote from @entity328			0
@entity1 's @entity329 , @entity330 and @entity331 contributed to this report .			0
