@entity0 -- @entity2 died sunday in the @entity3 he helped build			1
a few months ago , i wrote an appreciation as a way of marking his 75th birthday			0
the sentiments , of course , still stand and i 'm glad i did n't wait until his death to write it			0
we have lost a hero of our times , a friend of freedom , who lived his life with integrity and sent forward ripples of hope into the world			2
he will be missed and remembered			0
... draw up a compelling character representing the arc of the 20th century and it might look like this -- a child whose homeland is conquered by the @entity28 and then occupied by communists ; a playwright , essayist and dissident turned state prisoner of conscience turned leader of a victorious nonviolent revolution over a totalitarian dictatorship			2
he culminates his career as president of his newly liberated nation			2
this is the life of @entity2 as he celebrates his 75th birthday			1
in a time of @entity45 still unfolding and uncertainty about what will emerge in the place of those @entity50 dictatorships , @entity2 's life story takes on renewed relevance			1
the revelation of @entity2 's leadership was n't just the triumphant nonviolence of the @entity55 -- it was his bracing honesty , which was itself a revelation			1
read the opening lines of his first inaugural address to the @entity3 people : " my dear fellow citizens ... i assume you did not propose me for this office so that i , too , would lie to you			1
" this is the hallmark of @entity2 's writing -- challenges to power rooted not in imperious ideological rhetoric but harder - to - dismiss , human - size truths			1
take a look at his most enduring essay , " @entity69 , " written behind the @entity70 in the darkest days of the 1970s			2
in this classic call for everyday citizens to recognize their power to change their world , @entity2 uses the example of a @entity77 - era grocer placing a state - sponsored sign in his store window with the slogan : " workers of the world , unite ! " " if the greengrocer had been instructed to display the slogan ' i am afraid and therefore unquestioningly obedient ; ' he would not be nearly as indifferent to its semantics , even though the statement would reflect the truth , " @entity2 wrote			1
so why does he do it ? " the sign helps the greengrocer to conceal from himself the low foundations of his obedience , at the same time concealing the low foundations of power			0
it hides them behind the facade of something high			0
and that something is ideology , " @entity2 wrote			1
" ideology offers human beings the illusion of an identity , of dignity , and of morality while making it easier for them to part with them			0
" the power of those words ultimately helped inspire a revolution of citizen resistance to the totalitarian state			2
it may yet inspire more uprisings -- because beneath his appeal is not a vision of a utopian alternative , but the more basic human - scale virtue of civic responsibility , both for yourself and future generations			1
@entity2 's experience with the @entity28 and @entity126 taught him the lesson that utopian dreams often end in nightmares			1
consequently , @entity2 has cautionary words for the overheated acolytes of perpetual revolution and retribution			1
" @entity134 is well - known to breed violence , which is why most revolutions have degenerated into dictatorships , devouring their own offspring , " he wrote , " not knowing that they were digging their own graves and confining society in a vicious circle of revolutions and counter-revolutions			2
" there is this enduring wisdom as well : @entity2 's vision of an anti-totalitarian state ended up looking a lot like liberal capitalist democracy , with an emphasis on preserving pluralism and the uniqueness of a community			1
@entity2 was not allergic to the responsibilities of self - government , but instead embraced the mantle of authority in his own quixotic manner , never pretending to be perfect , leading by the power of his example rather than the example of his power			1
in office , he was a clear voice arguing for the @entity167 's efforts to intervene militarily to stop the ethnic cleansing in @entity169			0
at a time when many nations seemed confused , unable to see the conflict with moral clarity , @entity2 helped keep the western world focused on our commitment to " never forget			1
" retired from office and often wrestling ill - health , @entity2 continues to write			1
because he is one of the few recent world leaders who is primarily an author and artist , it is probably best to let his words speak for themselves on a few more varied subjects			0
-- on purposeful politics : " true politics , worthy of the name â € ” and the only kind i will practice â € ” is the politics of service to one 's neighbor			0
service to the community ; service to those who will succeed us ... if you are modest and do not lust after power , not only are you suited to politics , you absolutely belong there			0
" -- on globalization : " an amalgamation of cultures is taking place			0
... we are in a phase when one age is succeeding another , when everything is possible and almost nothing is certain			0
" -- on hope and persistence : " the only lost cause is one we give up on before we enter the struggle			0
" -- on a keeping a sense of humor : " anyone who takes himself too seriously always runs the risk of looking ridiculous ; anyone who can consistently laugh at himself does not			0
" we sometimes wait until people have passed to honor them appropriately			0
this seems like an avoidable oversight			0
if you 're inspired to learn more about @entity2 , pick up one of his many books , from collections like " open letters " to interview collections like " @entity231 " to ruminations and recollections in books like " @entity235 " and the most recent , " to the @entity236			2
" in an uncertain , always evolving world , i am certain of this : @entity2 's words and example will endure and continue to provide inspiration , lighting a path forward , reminding us that history takes place in the here and now and that we all contribute to making it			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity251 .			2
