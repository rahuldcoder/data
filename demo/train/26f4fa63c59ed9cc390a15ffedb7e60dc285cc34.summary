-- up for auction : @entity3 airport costing up to a reported $ 1.5 billion , little used			1
starting price ? $ 150 million			1
if that sounds improbable , you have n't been keeping up with the fallout from @entity3 's burst property bubble			1
the fire sale of the country 's first private international airport has become a powerful symbol of the economic downturn triggered by that implosion			1
with a 4,400 - meter - long runway , @entity20 's longest , on which the world 's largest airliner , the @entity18 380 , can land , @entity15 sounds as if it has quite a lot going for it			1
accepting bids from this week until december 27 , the five - year - old facility 200 kilometers south of @entity24 also has a passenger capacity of 10 million people a year and , something rare for an airport , star quality			1
last year , the @entity35 - winning @entity3 director @entity34 shot part of his last film , the high - flying romp " i 'm so excited ! " , at the so - called " ghost airport , " the @entity32 reports			1
' do n't land here ! ' plus points aside , what the airport equivalent of real estate agents might try to gloss over are the huge yellow crosses painted all over the runway			0
like hoardings on an abandoned building to keep squatters out , they 're designed to stop pilots landing at the airport by accident , where they could only recently have found themselves surrounded by a gaggle of @entity34 's actors playing screamingly camp air crew			2
which would have been confusing			0
another downside is that location , which sounds as though it might have been breezily dismissed amid the giddy excitement of the aforementioned 10 - year development boom			2
no one really goes to @entity15 , at least not on vacation			2
@entity61 calls it " an unspectacular @entity3 working town			1
" the sparsely populated surrounding region of @entity65 is where the @entity3 literary character @entity68 famously " tilted at windmills			2
" indeed , the airport was first called @entity70			2
@entity72 ' hero also gave rise to the word " quixotic , " meaning extravagant , unrealistic and impractical			0
more : man wakes up locked in on @entity77 jet ' @entity24 ' the airport was meant to serve the @entity3 capital and the @entity81 coast by high speed rail , but it appears to have been planned in the same vein as other far - flung but optimistically named airports , such as @entity85 © ( 85 kilometers from the @entity87 capital )			1
low - cost carriers such as @entity89 and @entity90 flew in to @entity91 , but the airport opened in the same year , 2008 , as the bursting of the @entity3 property bubble tipped the country 's economy into double - dip recession			1
by 2012 , the airport 's custom had dwindled to a few private arrivals , including prince @entity101 reportedly flying in for a boar hunt			0
later that same year , its operators having filed for bankruptcy , the airport closed for business			2
only to open up , now , for bids			0
in a statement to @entity0 , however , @entity108 , one of the bankruptcy administrators , insisted that widely published reports about the $ 1.5 billion cost to build the airport were untrue			1
the actual construction cost was only about one - third of that , he said , but it was difficult to determine the overall price tag due to a large number of pending court cases by property owners over expropriation costs for the land where the airport was built			0
" we are aware that inside and outside of @entity3 there 's the idea that building this airport was absurd and does n't make sense economically because it 's an airport ' without passengers , ' " @entity108 wrote			1
" nevertheless ... that has nothing to do with reality			0
" it 's an airport mainly aimed at business and industrial activity -- air cargo and [ other ] businesses in the aeronautical industry , " he said in the statement			0
" there is a large amount of unbuilt land , zoned for industrial use , around the airport that is being offered to the buyer as part of the airport package , " he added			0
princely sum who 'd buy an airport ? an idle @entity153 prince ? they probably get enough sun. @entity157 's @entity156 could snap it up : he might save on freight			0
or maybe @entity89 should actually buy its own airport			0
they say every cloud has a silver lining			0
for now , @entity91 is waiting for one to appear .			0

@entity15 costing $ 1.5 billion is for sale at $ 150 million
