no , you have n't stepped into a time machine -- president @entity6 's address to the nation on his strategy for dealing with the threat posed by @entity10 in @entity11 and @entity12 , delivered on september 10 , 2014 , had some striking similarities to his address on airstrikes against @entity17 's regime in @entity12 delivered exactly a year earlier			1
the bottom line was different			0
on september 10 , 2013 , @entity6 announced the @entity19 would not be launching airstrikes in @entity12 ; on wednesday , he announced the @entity19 military would			1
here 's what changed and what did n't over the past year : what 's changed ? no set timeline in his 2013 address , @entity6 was very clear that any military action in @entity12 would have been limited in its scope			1
" this would be a targeted strike to achieve a clear objective : deterring the use of chemical weapons and degrading @entity17 's capabilities , " he said			2
strong reaction to @entity6 statement : ' @entity10 is not @entity37 ' in his speech on wednesday , the president told @entity19 that this campaign to take out @entity10 would take time and left unanswered the question of how long the fight against the terrorist group might last			1
" now , it will take time to eradicate a cancer like @entity10 , " he said			0
" this counterterrorism campaign will be waged through a steady , relentless effort to take out @entity10 wherever they exist , using our air power and our support for partner forces on the ground			0
this strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us , while supporting partners on the front lines , is one that we have successfully pursued in @entity61 and @entity62 for years			0
" 9/11 although it took place on the eve of the 12th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks , @entity6 's speech last year did n't include any mention of 9/11			1
his speech on wednesday did , though it was just one line : " @entity70 marks 13 years since our country was attacked			2
" a recent @entity0 poll showed that 53 % of @entity19 are concerned with acts of terrorism in the @entity19 around the 9/11 anniversary , an increase from 39 % in 2011			0
a frightening , far - reaching new world of terror threats since 9/11 the popularity factor @entity6 acknowledged in 2013 that military intervention in @entity12 was not going to be embraced by the @entity19 public			1
" now , i know that after the terrible toll of @entity11 and @entity84 , the idea of any military action , no matter how limited , is not going to be popular			1
" @entity0 polling taken in september 2013 showed that was true : only 29 % of @entity19 thought it was in the national interest of the @entity19 to get involved in @entity12			1
this time , the politics are a bit easier			0
@entity19 overwhelming support additional airstrikes against @entity10 -- 76 % according to @entity0 polls			0
what has n't changed ? this is not going to be a repeat of the @entity11 war and there wo n't be " boots on the ground			0
" this continues to be a key point for the president , who never supported the war in @entity11			2
he stressed it in 2013 , saying : " i will not put @entity19 boots on the ground in @entity12			1
i will not pursue an open - ended action like @entity11 or @entity84			2
" he stressed it again on wednesday			0
" as i have said before , these @entity19 forces will not have a combat mission -- we will not get dragged into another ground war in @entity11			0
" @entity6 does n't need the approval of @entity117 , but he 'd like it			1
for a president that frequently blames @entity117 for not getting things done , @entity6 has demonstrated an enthusiasm for including them when it comes to the question of military action in @entity12			1
" even though i possess the authority to order military strikes , i believed it was right , in the absence of a direct or imminent threat to our security , to take this debate to @entity117 , " @entity6 said in 2013			1
" i believe our democracy is stronger when the president acts with the support of @entity117			2
and i believe that @entity19 acts more effectively abroad when we stand together			0
" transcript : president @entity6 's speech on combating isis and terrorism he made a strikingly similar remark on wednesday			1
" i have the authority to address the threat from @entity10			0
but i believe we are strongest as a nation when the president and @entity117 work together			2
so i welcome congressional support for this effort in order to show the world that @entity19 are united in confronting this danger			0
" one key difference though between then and now is the actual likelihood of congressional approval for military action			1
in 2013 , it was clear by the time @entity6 gave his @entity158 address that an authorization vote was going to fail in @entity117			1
on the fight against @entity10 , it appears likely that the president will get support from @entity117 on at least some elements			2
@entity165 : how @entity19 can stop @entity10 @entity19 ca n't fight every evil early in his remarks on wednesday , @entity6 noted " we can not erase every trace of evil from the world , and small groups of killers have the capacity to do great harm			1
" it was something he pointed out last year			2
" @entity19 is not the world 's policemen , " he said at the end of his 2013 remarks			0
" terrible things happen across the globe , and it is beyond our means to right every wrong			0
