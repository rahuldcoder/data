@entity0 , @entity1 -- let 's face it , footballers have a bad rep. they are labelled by many as overpaid selfish prima donnas who could not care less about the world around them			1
this may in reality apply to some players , but definitely not all of them			0
in @entity0 i recently met many who truly enjoy being role models and were honored to take part in the 7th edition of the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) @entity21			1
this year , in light of the tragic earthquake in @entity26 , all of the proceeds went to the devastated country as 55 thousand people filled the @entity29 to greet some of the best footballers on the planet , both past and present			2
the likes of @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 lent a hand to this cause			1
organizers were hoping to raise over $ 750 000 and in ticket sales alone , that target was reached			0
having the privilege to be behind the scenes at this match in my home country , i spoke with various players about their involvement in it			0
one of the most concerned about the plight of the @entity26 people was @entity34			2
the @entity51 forward , who made headlines for the wrong reasons after his controversial handball which helped prevent @entity56 from attending the @entity57 , had already personally pledged $ 90,000 to the @entity59 aid agency @entity58			1
" i am very touched by this tragedy and it is very good that everybody should mobilize in order to help @entity26 , " @entity34 told his club side @entity51 's official web site			1
" this touches me because almost 20 years ago something similar happened in ( the @entity59 @entity69 island of ) @entity70 and i know what the @entity26 must be going through			2
i have many friends over there			0
@entity26 is a former @entity59 colony and it 's as if we are cousins			1
" @entity34 showed true concern for a nation that needs all the help it can get to rebuild its infrastructure and its hope			2
@entity36 , @entity33 and @entity35 were others who told me they were shocked by some of the footage they saw coming out of @entity26			1
as the death toll rose , they felt they needed to do something to help , and were delighted so many high - profile names showed up			0
in all , some 40 international players participated in a match that was qualified as a success by all , including the former @entity93 striker			0
" we must help them			0
i felt i should do something and that 's why i have decided to make a donation to @entity58 , " said the former @entity93 legend .			0
