-- the entire world , it seems , is angry at @entity3			1
allegations of electronic spying by the @entity6 have reached far and wide			1
people everywhere -- friends and foes -- feel the @entity3 government breathing behind them , its eyes burning just over their shoulder			1
as @entity3 's @entity14 allies gather to discuss how to respond to the latest news of @entity3 spying , it is clear the time has come for @entity18 to take much more meaningful action to address the allegations			1
the fallout over electronic spying has becoming serious and costly			2
already @entity24 president @entity23 canceled a trip to @entity18 -- even after president @entity26 personally appealed to her -- in protest after reports of eavesdropping			0
the continuing drip of revelations from @entity32 , the former @entity6 contractor who fled the @entity3 with a trove of secret information about @entity3 's intelligence practices , has become more than an irritant and distraction			1
when news is made public that the @entity3 has been listening in , recording , saving information without authorization , governments are under pressure to respond			1
the price can easily exceed the benefits			1
it is time to rethink the decision - making process in @entity3 's gigantic electronic surveillance structure and to become more selective about how the @entity3 will use its surveillance resources and manpower			1
first , though , it 's worth noting that the @entity3 is not the first or the only country to engage in massive spying			1
the practice is older than the @entity57 , which tells many a tale of surreptitious intelligence gathering			2
the ancient @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 engaged in spying , and today practically every country does it			2
but spying technology has changed the landscape			2
it 's now possible to gather almost unlimited amounts of information about practically everyone on @entity72			0
at the same time , technology has also made it possible for just one well - positioned person to unveil all the virtual microphones to the world			0
that means intelligence gathering is easier and cheaper than ever			2
but it also means there 's a greater chance of getting caught			0
this has n't stopped intelligence chiefs the world over from forging ahead with data collection			2
spy masters in many capitals are shifting uncomfortably in their chairs , hearing their government and their nation 's citizens complain about @entity3 spying that looks a lot like what they do			1
in the @entity97 , a government report last year said one in every 1,000 phones in the country is tapped by the government			0
the point of the official @entity97 report was to complain that phone tapping is an inefficient and antiquated method			0
a few days ago , the @entity107 daily @entity106 published a detailed account of @entity3 eavesdropping in @entity107			1
the @entity107 people were indignant			0
the response from the government was more muted			0
the reason is simple : @entity107 intelligence does pretty much the same thing the @entity6 does , engaging in large scale " metadata " collection			2
in fact , @entity106 a few months ago revealed the @entity107 general @entity120 has been collecting massive amounts of private information			0
" the entirety of our communications are being spied on , " said the newspaper			0
" all of our e-mail messages , sms messages , itemized phone bills and connections to @entity131 and @entity132 are then stored for years			0
" sound familiar ? that 's exactly what @entity32 's first accounts revealed the @entity3 as doing			1
many people found it only normal and not particularly disturbing			0
others still were unsure : the government must protect the country , and that means spying			2
but how far is too far ? the @entity6 spying is driven by security concerns			2
it is a matter of national defense			0
other countries have spied for security but also to gain an advantage in business or against domestic political challenges			0
@entity155 is defending itself against charges that it spied on @entity159 firms			0
@entity160 has apologized to @entity24 for spying on @entity24 companies			2
and @entity24 intelligence has engaged in spying for domestic political reasons			1
spy chiefs are , more than anything , envious at the scale of surveillance the @entity6 has developed			1
this takes us back to a truth learned in childhood : the fact that everyone does it , or that so many do it , does not make it right			0
personal privacy has been steadily disappearing -- a deeply unsettling trend			2
but just because we seem to be moving inexorably in that direction , it does n't mean we should n't stop , review and decide if we should take action to stop it			0
there is no question that the @entity3 faces very real security threats , and some spying is necessary and justified			1
the question is who should the government be allowed to target in its invasion of privacy , and who should make that decision ? the existing system is far too lax			0
the latest reports allege that @entity3 spying reached into the activities of @entity3 's allies , including @entity197 chancellor @entity196			1
@entity198 called @entity26 , who denied the accusations , saying the @entity3 " is not monitoring and will not monitor " her communications			1
but the reason spying charges are the main topic of discussion at the summit of @entity208 leaders -- @entity3 's allies -- is that @entity18 is not addressing the substance of the complaints			1
personal assurances by @entity26 are not enough			0
the solution is not an apology but a change in current practices			0
as a starting point for rethinking the process , i suggest the establishment of an intelligence and privacy board , a group made up of individuals with strong knowledge of national defense , security , ethics , privacy and diplomacy			1
let them , under strict clearance , review the decision - making process			1
what should @entity3 collect ? who should be targeted , what should be saved ? when does the benefit outweigh the risk ? if you leave the question to the spies , they will choose to record it all , to save it all			1
that 's too easy , and it 's too dangerous			0
not surprisingly , it leaves everyone angry at @entity3			1
even if everybody else does it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity252 .			0

@entity254 : allies and enemies alike upset about *extent* of @entity3 spying **program**
she says cost in hurt relations may exceed benefits , and spying should be more selective
she says many other nations also spy and are even envious of @entity3 **program**
@entity269 : @entity3 needs intelligence and privacy board with *experts* to review spy process
