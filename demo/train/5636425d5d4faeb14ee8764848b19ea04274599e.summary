-- @entity2 employees , dressed in matching blue t - shirts , clapped and sang and made intermittent " woo ! " cheers , as they walked past @entity5 , who was waiting in line to buy the @entity7 5 in @entity8 last month			1
the 29 - year - old , who had never before waited in one of @entity12 's i - need - the - product - immediately - so - i 'm - willing - to - stand - here - for - hours lines , did n't look amused			1
about the time the sun was coming up , @entity5 leaned against a railing at @entity18 mall and pretty much scowled at all the hoopla			0
" i did n't have anything better to do , " he said of his decision to come to the mall and wait in line to buy the newest @entity12 smartphone			2
@entity5 , who asked that his last name not be used , had just come off of an overnight shift with an airline			0
" my girlfriend 's out of town , " he added			0
" i 'm just hanging out			0
" one year after the death of @entity12 co-founder @entity30 , that kind of indifference seems almost sacrilege when set against the history of @entity12 fanboy - dom that surrounds the company 's product launches			1
and while it 's true that that a woman in @entity40 waited in line for eight days , braving rain , police , wrecks and everything else that would be horrible about sleeping outside in @entity46 for a week , the excitement for the @entity7 seemed less palpable than in the past , at least among the masses			1
the cause ? that 's anyone 's guess			0
maybe it 's that this phone seems less exciting than its predecessors			0
maybe it 's harder for fans to drum up enthusiasm for @entity12 now that the once - scrappy underdog has become the world 's richest and most powerful tech company			1
or , more troubling for @entity12 loyalists , maybe some of the company 's sparkle is fading with consumers now that @entity30 , the design perfectionist , is no longer signing off on new products			1
# @entity67 : share your thoughts on his life and career obviously , there 's no lack of luster in @entity12 's stock price , which is reaching such heights -- it recently flirted with $ 700 a share -- that it 's been accused of swaying trends for entire markets			1
and @entity12 sold 5 million @entity80 in the first weekend , although that number was less than analysts had expected given the attendant hype and pent - up demand for the device			1
a shift , however , seemed evident at the launch of the new phone , at least with the random sampling of consumers who spoke with @entity0 that morning			0
it 's not that @entity12 is n't popular			1
it 's that perhaps the fans are n't as hyped up as they used to be			0
for starters , no one would claim @entity12 as a hero of the counterculture these days			2
that was evident in the fact that some of the line - standers in @entity8 talked about the phone not as some life - altering blessing from on high ( the @entity7 has been dubbed the " @entity105 phone , " let 's remember ) but in consumer - y and practical terms			1
one man , 31 - year - old @entity108 , wanted a better camera before he went on a family vacation			0
@entity111 , 45 , was in line to buy the phone for his teenage son , who wanted to be able to show it off to friends in the school lunchroom			0
" it could be a rock , " @entity111 said			0
" if everybody had a rock , he 'd want it			0
" opinion : @entity12 seems to have gotten a little bit lost the vibe shift was apparent to die - hard @entity12 fans as well			2
" the excitement has settled , " said @entity126 , 32 , who has waited in line for the new @entity12 smartphone every year since the @entity7 launched			1
" the biggest line i 've seen in the last five years was for the @entity131			0
" this line ? less so			0
" i think people know what they 're getting , and they 're just wanting to upgrade , versus getting the phone for the first time " and being super-thrilled about it , he said			0
in a @entity140 video of the recent opening of an @entity2 in @entity142 , some customers looked nonplussed , if not downright perturbed , by @entity12 's clapping , chanting mob of blue - shirted employees			1
the company is having trouble controlling the tech pundits , too			0
in a post titled " confessions of a former @entity12 fanboy , " blogger @entity149 writes that he is losing faith in @entity12 's ability to gin up the same level of fanaticism in the @entity158 era			2
" i 'm not saying this @entity7 iteration is an awful device , but i question whether @entity12 has the ability to maintain industry - leading innovation , " @entity149 writes on the site @entity160			1
" @entity12 has historically been known for creative design and disruptive technology , signature features that are surprisingly missing this time around			2
it is uncharacteristic of @entity12 to deliver an average product			2
my thoughts are that these specs can be found on nearly every other mid-to - high - end smartphone on the market			2
" @entity12 loyalist @entity174 , author of the influential blog @entity176 , wrote favorably about @entity178 's unveiling of its newest @entity180 competitor			2
" @entity181 argues that ( @entity178 ceo @entity182 is the inheritor to @entity30 's crown			1
not because @entity182 has copied anything @entity30 did , but because he has not			2
what he 's done that is @entity30 - like is doggedly pursue , year after year , iteration after iteration , a vision unlike that of any other company -- all in the name of making customers happy			1
" @entity195 points out that the @entity7 was supposed to cement @entity30 ' legacy			1
" reports around @entity30 ' passing talked about how he was focused on the @entity7 during his last days and predicted that it would be his ' legacy device , ' " contributor @entity197 writes			1
" that seemed plausible , given @entity30 ' reputation and the incremental nature of the @entity205 that came out around the same time , and helped to heighten the anticipation for this week 's @entity7 launch			1
" the new @entity7 does not meet those lofty ' legacy ' aspirations , however			2
the @entity7 is bigger , faster , thinner , etc. -- definitely a creditable offering that reiterates @entity12 's design , engineering and marketing chops			1
while it does nothing to detract from @entity30 ' design genius reputation , it does nothing to enhance it , either			2
" @entity12 has come under fire for its new error - filled maps application , which replaces @entity218 on @entity80 and in @entity219 , the company 's new mobile operating system			1
in a rare public letter , @entity12 ceo @entity222 apologized for the quality of the maps last week			0
frustrated @entity7 users have also complained about a bug that causes their phones to suck cellular data even when connected to a @entity230			0
of course , there 's always a counter-argument			0
here 's one from @entity234 , who responded to my question about the changing state of @entity12 fanboydom on @entity239 : " @entity240 certainly has n't changed much since @entity30			1
the people are loyal to the brand , not to the person who ran it			0
" even after people realize how bad the @entity247 is in the new @entity219 , those very same users are touting the greatness of @entity12			0
" it 's clear @entity12 employees ( check out this gallery ; hilarious ) and the company 's fanboy and fangirl loyalists will continue not just to buy @entity12 products but to love them , and the company behind them			1
the question is : what about everyone else ? " though @entity12 will remain a highly profitable company for years to come , i would be surprised if it ever gives us another product as transformative as the ( original ) @entity7 or the @entity180 , " writes @entity261 in the @entity263 ' opinion section			1
" part of the reason is obvious : @entity30 is n't there anymore , " he wrote			0
" it is rare that a company is so completely an extension of one man 's brain as @entity12 was an extension of @entity30			1
while he was alive , that was a strength ; now it 's a weakness			0
@entity12 's current executive team is no doubt trying to maintain the same demanding , innovative culture , but it 's just not the same without the man himself looking over everybody 's shoulder			2
" good or bad , what lessons did you learn from @entity30 ? share your responses in the comments below , or join the conversation on @entity288 using # stevejobstaughtme .			0

some @entity12 consumers seem less enthused about the company these days
maybe that 's because of the death of @entity30 ; maybe it 's @entity7 glitches
" the excitement has settled , " one @entity12 fan in @entity8 says
still , the company 's stock is near an all - time high , and the @entity7 is selling well
