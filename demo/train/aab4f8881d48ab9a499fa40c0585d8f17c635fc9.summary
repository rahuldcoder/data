when @entity2 shops for clothes in @entity4 , @entity5 , she sees plenty of selection in sizes 0 , 2 and 4 , but fewer in sizes 12 and 14			0
" you 're bombarded by it daily , " she said of the message that thin is better			1
" but according to a report published in the @entity15 , being thin might not be in your best interest in the long run			2
the report is drawing strong reaction in the medical community , among proponents who hail its findings and among critics , one of whom dismisses it as " rubbish			0
" the comprehensive study confirmed that obese people tend to die earlier than people of normal weight			1
but it also found that overweight people -- those with a body mass index ( @entity34 ) of 25 to 30 -- had a lower risk of dying than people of normal weight			1
" if i were to look at this study and if it is shown to be true , i would think maybe i should be worrying less that i 'm wearing a size 12 and focus on how i feel , " said @entity2 , a 44 - year - old nurse whose @entity34 fluctuates from 24 to 26			1
researchers analyzed nearly 100 studies that included more than 2.8 million people			2
while obese people had a higher risk of death -- particularly those whose @entity34 was 35 or more -- overweight people had a 6 % lower risk of death than those of normal weight			1
" because this bias against weight has been so prevalent , it 's really been unquestioned , and i think this concept that thin is healthy and fat is not healthy is clearly not true , " said @entity47 , a physician and author of " @entity49			1
" big deal : you can be fat and fit some thin people exercise excessively and do n't eat a balanced diet , and there are people in the overweight and obese categories who have good diets and are active , she said			1
may said people need to focus on choices about eating and physical activity rather than be concerned about the numbers on a scale			2
" i find it interesting that the reason they did this is because this is something that has shown up over and over again			0
it is challenging to shift a paradigm that has become so deeply entrenched , that being overweight by @entity34 category automatically puts you at high risk , " she said			2
@entity80 overemphasize the importance of being thin , said professor @entity82 , author of " @entity83 " and director of the @entity85 at @entity86			1
" we have had for decades now an obsession with thinness and an obsession with weight and how to lose it , " he said			0
" i think the forces in our culture -- in fashion , in fitness , in health and wellness -- all have been predicated on , ' a thin body is a good body and a fat body is a bad body , ' and that 's wrong			1
i have always believed that a good , healthy body can come in many shapes and sizes			1
" fat , fit people tend to be better off healthwise than thin people who are unfit , @entity82 said , suggesting that being fit is far more important than being thin			1
" i think in general , @entity80 is still not ready to accept this notion that fitness comes in many shapes and sizes , " he said			1
" it 's a good message , but i still think people would rather be thin			1
" exercise lengthens your life -- even if you 're overweight the study authors say it 's possible that overweight people live longer because they get better medical care and are tested for diabetes , heart problems and other diseases stemming from their weight			1
heavier people might also be able to better survive infections or surgery			2
while many say the findings make sense , some experts take issue with the way the research was conducted and express concern it will send wrong message			0
" of course , a lot of people would like to hear that it 's no problem that they are overweight or obese , " said @entity138 , professor of medicine at @entity140 and chair of the @entity143 's @entity142			1
" it causes a lot of confusion that 's completely unnecessary			0
" he called the study " a pile of rubbish			2
" scientists often disagree , said @entity155 , senior investigator at the @entity156 and one of the authors of the study			2
" we published our findings in the peer - reviewed scientific literature to invite discussion , " he said in an e-mail			0
" it is by engaging with our colleagues in this manner that science advances			0
" @entity34 is one of three numbers people should watch , according to @entity138			2
" it 's also useful to look at weight change since age 20 , " he said			0
" that 's going to primarily be fat			2
the third is your waistline			0
the vast majority of people will be best off if they do not increase their weight or waistline after age 20			2
" not smoking , eating a high - quality and healthful diet , not being overweight and being physically active all contribute to a person 's health , he said			2
@entity189 , most obese @entity80 city , moving from fat to fit while the majority of experts and scientists believe that excess weight is unhealthy , dr. @entity192 , professor of medicine and public health at the @entity195 , takes a different stance			1
a black - and - white approach to obesity is inappropriate , he said			0
" most experts have problems with this sort of data , " he said			0
" it 's difficult to see that some of these principles are being questioned			0
" @entity210 compares the lack of consensus about weight and fat to the evolution of thought about alcohol consumption			0
alcohol was thought to be detrimental to a person 's health , but studies started to show that alcohol consumption in moderation could have some health benefits , he said			0
" the fat - is - bad principle is a very recent approach , " he said			0
" body - stored fat has helped us for hundreds of thousands of years to survive hardships			1
that should tell us evolutionarily there was something good in that			0
" a higher body mass index can be protective in certain situations , he said			1
" once you are in your 70s , 80s or 90s , or if you have chronic disease like heart failure , rheumatoid arthritis , chronic lung and kidney disease , a larger body size gives you longevity , " he said			0
not all fat is bad , but belly fat is more harmful than fat in the arms , legs or buttocks , he said			0
global report : obesity bigger health crisis than hunger fitness expert @entity258 said people should n't get caught up with numbers			1
" i always got people focused on their bodies rather than on a number and make them more aware of their muscle tissue , their shape , " he said			1
" are they getting stronger ? faster ? can they pedal longer ? if you listen to your body more , you will know the symptoms before your body starts to break down			1
we tend to forget about our bodies and that 's when we start getting fat			0
" @entity2 said she can see where a little bit of extra fat could be good for people facing a serious illness , but said the more weight you have , the harder it is on your joints			1
excess weight also comes with numerous health challenges , including circulatory problems , high blood pressure and diabetes , she said			0
" i think the numbers have their place , " she said			0
" they do give us some reference but it does ultimately come down to how you are feeling , your exercise tolerance , are you able to do the things you love to do without any difficulty ? " that 's the kind of thing i should be focusing more on , rather than that my jeans come from the back of the rack rather than the front , " she said .			0
