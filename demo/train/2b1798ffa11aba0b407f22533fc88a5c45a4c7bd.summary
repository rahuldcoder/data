-- @entity1 and @entity2 sat in a meeting late tuesday afternoon , planning a ministry trip to @entity5 when they were interrupted by a text message			1
a co-worker read the news : a powerful earthquake had just struck the @entity12 country			2
in their @entity15 , @entity16 , office , @entity17 said , " my heart just dropped " as he listened to the one - line bulletin			2
the quake 's epicenter was a few miles from an orphanage in @entity22 , @entity5 , where the @entity24 ' 21 - year - old daughter @entity23 was working , and the 5 - year - old girl they were about to adopt lived			1
" i felt like i could n't take another breath , " @entity2 said , " i jumped up and yelled , ' this ca n't be happening			1
' " the first bits of news were discouraging , as sketchy reports came in of buildings collapsing and widespread destruction			2
" it was horrible , " @entity2 said			1
" we spent hours trying to get any information			1
" the @entity37 where she is director frequently works with churches and groups in @entity5			1
any phone number they had in the country was quickly written on a board in the office			0
" a group of 20 ( people ) sat and dialed the numbers over and over and over again			0
" " there are no words to explain that two people i love dearly were in the middle , and i could n't reach then , " @entity17 said , his voice cracking			0
but it was more than 24 hours before they finally got word			2
a brief , scratchy call from their daughter @entity23 came through -- she and 5 - year - old @entity61 had survived the quake that destroyed the orphanage			1
@entity2 said @entity23 was able to say , " i 'm alive			1
please just know we 're alive , " before the 40 - second call was cut off			1
it would be thursday before the @entity24 learned the whole story			1
@entity17 , with two ministry officials , was able to travel into @entity5 on a medivac plane , and the three made their way to the town			1
" there was destruction all around , " he said from @entity5 , " when i saw what was left of that building , i knew they were protected			1
" @entity23 , @entity61 and 47 other children all made it out , but were living in the parking lot across from the shattered orphanage			1
when @entity17 finally found his daughter , she ran up to him at full speed and hugged him			2
" i can totally see her knocking him to the ground , " her mother said			0
the first order of business : a call home to a nervous mom			0
@entity17 was able to get through on a rare working cell phone , and told his wife , " need to you to hear something			0
" @entity2 said the next words were from @entity61 , barely able to speak @entity97 , saying , " ' @entity98 , i love you			1
' i started screaming at the top of my lungs			0
" @entity17 and his colleagues brought food , water and supplies to the 200 quake victims in the parking lot			0
he described the injured , including one with a broken leg , being treated for two days in the heat with nothing more than an aspirin			0
the group arranged a bus to take the children to a guest house , a trip delayed when the bus broke down			2
but that news was minor , knowing they would have shelter and supplies			0
for the @entity24 , the next struggle is how to bring @entity61 home			1
they had been in @entity5 just last week finishing paperwork for the adoption , but the office handling the case was destroyed in the quake			2
" all that paperwork , @entity130 knows where it is , " @entity17 said			0
" that building was five stories , now it 's five feet tall			0
" for @entity2 , waiting for news at home , " i feel like i 'm floating on top of my body			2
" " like i 'm living a dream and waiting to wake up , " she said			0
this week has gone " from hopelessness to hope to tears to ' i ca n't take another phone call because i do n't know what will happen , ' " she said			0
@entity17 said he is working with the @entity145 embassy seeking emergency help to bring @entity61 to @entity15			0
" we are going to do it , " he said , his voice the strongest it had been all day .			0

@entity24 ' 21 - year - old daughter , and the 5 - year - old girl they were about to adopt live in @entity5
" we spent hours trying to get any information , " @entity2 says
daughters and 47 other children all made it out of orphanage alive
@entity163 traveled to @entity5 on a medivac plane for *joyous* *reunion*
