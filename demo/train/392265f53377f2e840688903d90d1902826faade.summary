-- i 'll take saddest jeopardy misspelling ever for $ 3,000 , @entity3			1
social media is still howling after last week 's perceived slight of eighth - grader @entity5 and his misspelling of " emancipation " during @entity8 on " @entity9 ! " @entity5 knew the answer to the @entity9 question : @entity12 called this document , which took effect in 1863 , " a fit and necessary war measure			1
" but the 12 - year - old @entity17 boy added an extra " t " to his answer : emanciptation proclamation			1
host @entity21 said @entity5 " misspelled it badly			1
" " that 's unfortunate , " he said			2
" the judges are ruling against you			2
" teen gives greatest ' @entity9 ! ' question ever @entity5 , who was in second place with $ 9,600 in winnings , had wagered $ 3,000 on the answer			1
" the thing that bothered me most was the way @entity21 and the producers treated my son			0
they were kind of smug , " his father , @entity36 , told @entity0 on sunday night			0
" it 's a kids ' tournament ! everyone knew what he meant			2
" the show was recorded in february , but aired wednesday			0
@entity5 said his son " was barely holding it together , he was almost in tears			1
he had to relive it on wednesday			0
" watch : i lost on jeopardy jeopardy producers stood by their decision			2
" if @entity9 ! were to give credit for an incorrect response ( however minor ) , the show would effectively penalize the other players			0
we love presenting young people as contestants on our show , and make every effort to be fair and consistent in their treatment			0
" right or wrong , the younger @entity5 still would not have won			1
he ran into a buzz saw of a competitor in @entity64 , who set the all - time record for kids with $ 66,600			1
@entity64 's haul was also the third - largest one - day total in the game 's history			1
for placing second , @entity5 took home $ 2,000			1
the @entity72 was not amused			0
" i used to love @entity9 , but how @entity3 treated that kid and embarrassed him was uncalled for , " @entity73 said in a post on the @entity9 ! facebook page			0
" he called him out on his spelling saying it was badly misspelled when it was n't that badly misspelled it was just misspelled slightly			0
" some questioned the point of the game show			0
" @entity9 is not a spelling bee game and frankly before @entity21 or the judges penalize this boy for not spelling a word correctly then @entity21 needs too explain too the contestants that spelling matters in the final around , " @entity85 also said on @entity86			0
a healthy back - and - forth ensued with those who found the show made the right call			2
" @entity101 ! " said @entity99 on @entity100			0
" if you were to give credit for a misspelled answer ... how close would the spelling need to be ? " @entity86 user @entity106 put it in perspective : " am sorry @entity5 feels that he was ' cheated ' because of misspelling			1
even if the answer had been allowed , he still would have been in second place and won $ 2,000 , which is what he won			1
" in 2010 : jeopardy pits humans champs against @entity117 computer			2
