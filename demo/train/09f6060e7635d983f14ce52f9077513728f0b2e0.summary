do n't try to drive over these bridges			1
these rocky natural spans were formed over millennia by the flowing waters of a stream or other water source , which slowly eroded away the rock to create the shape of a bridge			1
but are they arches or bridges ? the @entity12 and @entity13 , whose @entity15 - like members go hunting for these rock formations around the world , makes this distinction : a natural arch is made of rock , with a hole formed by natural forces , they say			1
a natural bridge is a type of arch , where water is the natural force making the hole			1
erosion created these magnificent structures , and erosion will eventually take them down			0
one such wonder was @entity35 's @entity34 , which was first formed by pounding surf eroding its coral limestone			1
the 100 - foot - span gave way and collapsed in 2005			0
( the smaller @entity40 is still standing nearby			0
) here are 15 spectacular natural bridges around the world			1
@entity44 's crazy rock formations @entity45 of @entity46 , @entity47 one of the most famous spots in @entity46 , the @entity45 of @entity46 and the rocky @entity50 coastline , are part of a national park			1
nearby you can also spot the @entity54 , known as the @entity54 in @entity46			0
eventually it 's expected that the ocean will wear away the @entity45 and the middle will collapse , turning it into stacks			1
visitors who continue along the coast to see @entity61 should note that it 's in a @entity64 range and must be visited through walks organized by the @entity54			1
@entity34 , @entity66 not all the glory of @entity66 is found at its two internationally famous @entity68 and @entity69 in the northwestern part of the state			1
less well - known but worth the visit is the majestic @entity34 in eastern @entity66 , about 40 miles east of @entity73			0
the 50 - foot tall , 100 - foot - long natural bridge over @entity75 is the star of this 22 - acre park			1
@entity78 , @entity79 as streams cut into the canyon walls and flash floods further weakened them , the three mighty bridges at @entity78 in the southeastern corner of @entity79 were carved over millions of years			1
the area was declared a national monument in 1908 , and the three bridges were given the @entity89 names " @entity90 , " " @entity91 " and " @entity92 " in 1909			2
further erosion has made the once thick and mighty @entity94 more delicate			2
while still massive and strong , @entity95 did lose 4,000 tons of rock in 1992			2
@entity97 , @entity98 a natural bridge formed by the @entity100 in the south of @entity98 , the @entity97 has a world - famous neighbor : the @entity105 cave paintings , the world 's oldest known such works , which date back 36,000 years			1
top 25 amusement parks around the world discovered in 1994 , the site was named a @entity110 this year			2
but the region 's natural beauty is also a national treasure			1
classified as a @entity98 national heritage site in 1982 , the 54 - meter - long ( 177 - foot - long ) natural arch is the only @entity98 example of a natural bridge spanning a still - flowing river			2
it 's also a gateway to the river canyon			2
@entity121 , @entity122 a famous natural bridge anchors this @entity125 beach , which is best known for its tide pools -- go exploring at low tide -- and seasonal monarch butterfly residents			2
up to 100,000 monarchs typically move into the state beach 's @entity131 in mid-october , and they depart the following january or february			2
there 's a party in october to welcome them , and seasonal tours are available			2
@entity137 , @entity138 @entity138 's @entity139 is best known for the @entity140 , towering limestone rock stacks carved by the @entity142			1
the ocean is still working on the rock , with seven of eight formations still standing			2
but there 's another gem in this park about 275 kilometers west of @entity149 : @entity137 , a natural offshore rock span that partially collapsed in 1990 and became a bridge without a connection			1
( people standing on the rocks were stranded when the middle collapsed and had to be rescued via helicopter			0
) it 's a good idea to stay on the accessible walking paths and scenic drives along the coast			2
spectacular waterfalls around the @entity44 @entity162 , @entity163 @entity163 has quite a collection of natural bridges , including one that experts say has the longest span of any natural bridge in the world			1
the @entity162 ( @entity172 ) , in southwestern @entity163 's @entity173 near the border with @entity175 , has a 400 - foot span			1
not that the bridge made of limestone karst is easy to measure			2
members of the @entity12 and @entity13 took a boat to the site in 2010 and used laser equipment to measure the span , calling it the " longest known natural arch in the world , by a wide margin			1
" @entity187 , @entity188 @entity189 wrote part of " @entity191 " in @entity192 , and several scenes from the @entity194 were shot here			0
it 's no wonder : the fairytale landscape of this region , now part of the @entity188 , is magical			2
go see its most well - known symbol : the @entity187 , a natural bridge standing tall in @entity192 , now part of the @entity188			0
while there are many rock formations rising up amid the forests and valleys in the park , @entity187 is the largest stone bridge on the @entity210 continent , with a span of 27 meters ( nearly 90 feet ) and a height of 21 meters ( nearly 70 feet )			0
@entity213 , @entity214 bedouin tribes still live in goat - hair tents in the @entity217 of southern @entity214 , which is 720 square kilometers ( about 278 square miles ) of mostly desert wilderness			0
among the sandstone and granite mountains and valleys are natural bridges rising up to greet you			1
although visitors can take private cars or hike on foot to explore the bridges and the region , @entity225 cooperatives offer tours via basic jeep or pickup trucks			0
and if you want a real adventure , book a camel ride to explore the area and overnight in a @entity225 camp			0
cliffside beaches around the world @entity34 at @entity241 , @entity242 while many nature loving explorers head to @entity242 's famous @entity246 , there are tall peaks , amazing waterfalls and a spectacular natural bridge to be found to the west at @entity241			1
located on the western slopes of the @entity252 in @entity253 , @entity241 definitely lives up to its name ( a @entity257 expression of awe and wonder )			0
travelers can witness @entity261 still carving its path through this natural bridge			0
@entity264 , @entity265 it 's true that southeastern @entity265 's @entity264 , named a @entity110 in 1982 , is better known for more than 15,000 drawings and engravings dating back to 6,000 b.c. the drawings record climate change and human life in the region			0
but tucked away in this tense region at the edge of the @entity276 , near the border with @entity278 , @entity279 and @entity280 , this spot was also recognized as a @entity282 site for its remarkable collection of natural bridges and rock formations dense enough to be called " rock forests			1
" the eroding sandstone " forests of rock " document the environmental changes , marking major climate change and geological transformation over the millennia			0
water and wind have shaped this magical , lunar - like landscape			0
@entity34 , @entity298 long considered sacred by the @entity299 , @entity298 's @entity34 was one of this @entity303 colony 's earliest recognized natural wonders			1
the bridge was created by an underground stream flowing through a cave , whose roof collapsed , according to the arch society			0
it even had a famous owner : @entity312 bought the surrounding land and bridge from @entity315 of @entity303 in 1774 , before the young republic 's founding			0
a @entity318 , the land in @entity320 remained in the hands of private owners for centuries			0
now the state of @entity298 has announced plans to turn the land into a park by the end of 2015			0
@entity329 , @entity330 in the western @entity330 province of @entity332 lies the @entity329 , a cavernous area near the @entity333			0
the @entity334 flows beneath a natural bridge , which is connected to a cave that served as one of revolutionary leader @entity338 's hideouts during the 1962 @entity340			1
the area is now popular with birdwatchers			0
@entity343 , @entity344 when @entity347 researchers traveled to @entity344 in 2010 to conduct a wildlife survey in the troubled country , they discovered an enormous natural bridge that may be one of the largest in the world			1
they returned to @entity343 , in the central highlands of @entity344 , in 2011 to take measurements			0
the bridge , which is named after a local village , is more than 60 feet high , has a span of more than 200 feet across its base and rises more than 3,000 meters ( nearly 10,000 feet ) above sea level			0
it was created over the millennia by the then - flowing waters of the dry @entity364			0
@entity365 , @entity366 is it a natural bridge ? a cornerstone of @entity371 in @entity366 , the @entity369 may actually be a bridge			0
there 's evidence to suggest that the waters of @entity376 flowed through a cave in the canyon wall long ago , expanding the tunnel that 's now @entity380 the question as you marvel at one of the few natural arches in the west made of limestone rather than sandstone .			1

natural arches around the world are made of rock , with a hole formed by natural forces
natural bridges are arches where water is the force making the hole
*stunning* natural bridges can be found all over the world
