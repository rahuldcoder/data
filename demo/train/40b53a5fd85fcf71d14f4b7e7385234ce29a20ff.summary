-- @entity1 , a photographer from @entity2 , @entity3 , has documented food at her local county fair for the past couple of years			1
" my favorite fair food has elements of the unexpected , " she said			1
" it 's bigger and weirder than the food i see every day , and it evokes awe ... the more absurd the better			2
" @entity1 , who tries mostly everything she photographs , drew the line when she snapped a picture of @entity15 -- french fries covered in pinto beans , chile sauce and cheese			1
" it looked like they weighed about two pounds and that there was enough for a family of four to share , " she said			0
" i 'd say there was more saturated fat on that plate than i care to imagine			0
" but fat and calories are n't enough to stop many fair - goers from indulging in such creations once a year , even when healthy options are available			1
fair foods can be enjoyed in moderation , says dr. @entity34 , who specializes in nutrition and preventive medicine at the @entity37			1
" instead of kind of throwing caution to the wind ... it 's still possible to enjoy yourself and enjoy some good tastes , yet stay reasonably on track			0
" for that , @entity34 offered some suggestions : before you go devise a plan ahead of time			1
" put a little thought into it -- what kinds of foods do you want to try ? how much do you want to eat ? " he said			2
" just have a general plan instead of going in and just eating everything in sight or the first thing that you see			0
" a workout and a healthy meal can help you resist temptation later			0
" if you do n't eat anything in the morning , you might get there and be ravenous ... that can lead to overeating , " @entity34 said			1
the deep - fried belly of the fair food beast during the fair splitting food with family or friends allows smaller tastes of multiple things			1
in addition , you can satisfy yourself by having a little bit of food when you get to the fair , @entity34 suggested			1
he said it 's best to stop eating before you 're full			0
" you 'll be glad that you did later on , " he says			0
remember to use some common sense			0
limit portion sizes of fatty or fried foods			1
he also recommended using your time at the fair to get in a great walk , helping to burn off some of those calories			2
finally , do n't forget that liquid calories add up			0
stay well - hydrated with water			2
following the fair indulging once a year " is n't going to cause a huge amount of problems , " @entity34 said			1
" we can recover from that relatively easily			0
" " people should forgive themselves and move on ... and not throw in the towel completely if they do overindulge			0
" @entity34 advised fair - goers to focus their attention elsewhere , instead of solely on the food			1
typically , people can take in an abundance of sights and sounds from arts and crafts , scale - tipping pumpkins , livestock and live entertainment			2
for @entity1 , there is always something new to see -- and taste -- every year			0
she is looking forward to documenting next year 's fair			1
" everyone has their own trigger and the fair is a perfect excuse to pull it , " she said			0
" the look of excitement on their face is unmistakable , and similar to the look i see in line for the roller coaster or the freak show			0
" fried kool - aid at the @entity124			2

fair and *festival* - goers spend millions on *concession* food every year
from fried oreos to " @entity15 , " the possibilities are *endlessly* fattening
fair foods can be enjoyed in moderation , says dr. @entity34
