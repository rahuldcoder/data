@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 parties in @entity1 will not get enough votes in the coming election to nominate a presidential candidate , according to polls , analysts and an @entity4 party official			1
supporters of @entity1 's @entity12 of @entity13 take part in a campaign event in @entity0 on march 24			1
nevertheless , the influence of @entity4 on politics in @entity1 -- the world 's most populous @entity4 country -- has many nationalist parties changing their strategy			1
the april 9 national elections will determine the makeup of @entity1 's 550 - seat parliament , as well as its regional representation council , provincial , county and city assemblies			1
more than 38 parties are vying for these seats , but very few are expected to get the 20 percent of parliamentary seats needed to nominate a presidential candidate in the july election			1
in fact , the only party expected to meet the 20 percent threshold is president @entity36 's @entity12			1
other parties will have to join alliances to nominate a president			2
@entity36 's " charming " personality , and his government 's ability to weather the current worldwide financial downturn , have kept him on top of the polls , according to @entity46 , who analyzes @entity1 politics and economy			1
@entity46 said despite the influence of @entity4 on @entity1 politics , voters are more concerned about economic issues			1
" like everywhere in the world , economics is the key factor , " he said			0
" it 's quite clear from all these surveys , when inflation was high , the president 's popularity is low			2
now that inflation has come down , the president 's popularity is high , and he and his party are doing very well in the polls coming into the election			2
" so far , @entity1 has not felt the impact of the global recession , partly because its economy is more isolated than other countries '			2
but the government has taken steps to protect the currency and the economy from the downturn , @entity46 said			0
" this will probably just be a speed bump for @entity1 , " he said			2
although financial issues are the main concern for voters in @entity1 -- where poverty is rampant -- @entity36 's @entity12 has recently had to bow to pressure from @entity4 groups			1
@entity83 , a spokesman for the president , acknowledged that the party 's support for an anti-pornography bill -- which was passed in october -- was a " symbolic gesture " to the @entity4 groups that had called for the measure			1
" during the process of legislation , ( the government ) made sure we do not support pornography , " @entity83 said			0
" but there should be no limitation on freedom of arts and expression " he noted that the final law was not as strong as the initially proposed bill			0
another issue that has made headlines in the @entity1 media is the government 's position on @entity108 , a @entity4 sect that does not believe @entity110 is the last prophet			1
the government recently restricted the freedoms of the group , but has so far refused to ban the group			0
" in @entity1 , one group of @entity4 radicals would like the government to ban @entity108 ... so the government 's using the middle approach in which we will not ban @entity108 because they have a right , " @entity83 said			1
" but there are certain things that are sensitive to ( their ) operation that are regulated by government			0
" one of those groups that has been outspoken in its rejection of @entity108 is @entity1 's @entity129			1
the chairman of the council , @entity130 , disputed media reports that the council has given @entity36 's government a deadline to ban the sect or it will issue an edict against voting for @entity36			2
@entity130 -- who goes by one name -- said the council 's fatwa against @entity108 was first issued in 1980 , but it had to reissue the edict last year because of complaints that the sect was trying to convert other @entity143			2
" we agree @entity108 must be a new religion , not part of @entity4 , " @entity130 said			2
the council is an independent organization , but remains very influential			0
in january , it issued several new fatwas -- including bans on smoking for children and pregnant women , and chanting during yoga			0
a fatwa is a legal pronouncement for @entity143 , but the council said it has no authority to enforce them			0
@entity1 's @entity4 parties are also adopting more moderate positions to attract more voters , which has caused internal divisions -- particularly for @entity164 , translated as the @entity164			1
@entity164 legislator @entity165 , known as @entity166 , said the party " is between a rock and a hard place			0
" " we have to behave like a political party and also an @entity4 movement , " he said			2
that has led to a split between the hard - liners and the moderates in the @entity164			0
" we are using the elections as a test , " @entity166 said			0
" hopefully , if we are able to convince the public , @entity164 will continue to be a significant player in politics			0
" another @entity4 party , the @entity183 , or @entity183 , said it intends to use the 2009 election to position itself for the next election in five years			1
" all parties want to reach the 20 percent threshold ( to nominate a presidential candidate ) , @entity183 included , " said the party 's vice secretary - general , @entity189			1
" but realistically almost no party will be able to nominate on its own			0
" that does not mean that a small party like @entity183 can not succeed , he said			0
@entity189 said @entity183 hopes it can put forward a vice presidential candidate who could possibly run for the top spot in the 2014 election			1
" we need to build a foundation now , " he said			0
" so one way to do this is to join one of the senior people ( politicians ) with a junior person this time			0
... " 2009 could be the beginning of the new generation " of politicians .			0
