-- @entity1 knows what it takes to win the @entity4 -- so when he says he would rather go into battle with @entity6 in his side than @entity8 , it is probably worth listening			1
six - time major winner @entity1 remains @entity11 's most successful player in the competition having taken 25 points from his duels against the @entity15 while his captaincy during the 2008 defeat at @entity18 was firmly criticized following a disappointing defeat , he remains one of the most iconic figures of the competition			1
@entity22 slams @entity4 rival @entity1 with the @entity15 and @entity11 set to go head - to - head at @entity27 in @entity28 on friday , world @entity24 is expected to lead the charge for @entity31 's team			1
the 23 - year - old has enjoyed a sensational run of form , winning the @entity35 and the @entity36 and more recently the @entity37 , before pocketing a cool $ 3 million at the @entity38 last weekend			2
those achievements have convinced @entity1 to back a man playing in just his second @entity4 tournament ahead of 14 - time major champion and current @entity43 " i 'd pick @entity6 , " said @entity1			1
" they 're both really marked men now			0
" @entity6 is at the top of the game and everybody in @entity15 wants to beat him now and at 23 he has a pretty daunting job on his shoulders			2
@entity6 dismisses claim that @entity8 is ' intimidated ' " you send out your teams you think are going to give you a point but he 's a marked man so it gives him a moral victory if somebody beats him as well and that 's what i 'm trying to say			1
" it 's the same with @entity8			0
i think @entity8 has obviously changed a lot			0
i think he recognises the importance of having that team around him and how good it is for him to do his bit for the team			0
" every player would love to do their part for the @entity4 team			2
" @entity11 triumphed by a single point at @entity72 two years ago with @entity74 's @entity73 sinking the winning putt following his titanic tussle with @entity77			1
@entity11 beats @entity15 to win @entity4 a quick glance at the world rankings shows that @entity11 has four players inside the top five with @entity82 at @entity83 separating the likes of @entity6 from @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			1
but the @entity15 is looking a far more accomplished team this time around with the likes of @entity90 hoping to build on his stunning @entity92 and @entity38 victory			0
@entity15 captain @entity93 also has the likes of @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 to call on in addition to the more experienced players such as @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			0
" on paper you look at the two teams and they 're really well matched , " said @entity1			1
" both teams have got bombers , both teams have got steady - eddies and both have got fiery putters " at the start of the year i said it would maybe be a tie to try and dismiss the question early on			2
but now it could be			0
" i 'm not sitting on the fence , it could be a point either way and who knows who is going to get the momentum			0
" i 'm split in the middle and it could well be a tie			0

@entity1 has won more points at the @entity4 than any other @entity11 player in *history* of competition
@entity1 captained @entity11 during their *disastrous* defeat at @entity18 four years ago
@entity133 @entity6 set to lead @entity11 *challenge* at @entity135
@entity1 unable to predict a winner with both teams so evenly matched
