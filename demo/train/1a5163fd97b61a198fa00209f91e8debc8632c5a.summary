-- after the @entity4 nuclear power plant disaster , @entity2 soldiers had to do the hard , potentially risky , cleanup job			1
fears of radiation exposure , sickness and death were rampant			1
in the months after , however , it was n't the rate of cancer that increased : it was the rate of suicide			1
this is now quoted widely in nuclear industry circles as a textbook case of " radiophobia			2
" we are hard - wired , it seems , to react with fear to what we do n't understand			1
it 's what we all learn as children : remember the story of @entity27 ? the sky is falling			2
@entity29 is in demand around the world as an expert on weapons of mass destruction			2
@entity0 has hired him to advise us on the ground about radiation levels and the potential risks			1
he says right now there is a fear overload and a shortage of fact			1
" when we talk about radiophobia , people hear that word ' radiation ' and immediately imagine the worst -- we 're all going to die and turn into the @entity46 and start mutating , " he says			1
the images from the @entity49 nuclear emergency have not helped ease fears			2
pictures of a ruined power plant , smoke billowing into the sky after explosions and fires and talk of a potential meltdown have sparked panic			0
too many people watching television images , fire - trucks and choppers dumping water on the reactors , smacked of last - ditch desperation			1
in @entity68 , foreigners have headed for the exits			0
long lines have formed at the immigration department ; at the airport people line up for flights			2
many say the same thing : they just do n't trust what they 're told			1
the @entity79 government has struggled with communication			1
critics say it is often too little , too late			0
there 's a worrying lack of detail			0
the @entity86 , which runs the @entity88 plant , has been accused of having a questionable record when it comes to the truth			0
officials in @entity79 may have consistently told people that radiation levels pose no risk to health , but few here are willing to bet their life on that			1
@entity100 survived the atomic bomb of @entity102			0
he knows about nuclear fear and suspects people are not getting the truth here			1
" the company is hiding information			0
they are lying about it ; they 're not disclosing the risk , " he says			2
so what are the available facts as they stand right now ? take a comparison with @entity4			0
in the @entity2 , reactor workers died within weeks			0
in the final phase of that disaster , radiation hit levels of 6,000 millisieverts per hour			1
@entity88 's peak has been 400 millisieverts per hour , and that 's at the red hot center of the plant itself			0
according to the @entity124 , you need exposure to 1,000 millisieverts per hour before suffering radiation sickness			2
even for the heroic workers still in the plant , prolonged exposure , says @entity29 , could make them sick , but it will not kill them			0
" no , not at all			0
four hundred millisieverts sounds scary , but it 's not , " he says			0
a caveat : this emergency is in uncharted territory , it could always take a turn for the worse			1
after a week of trying everything and resorting to dropping water from helicopters , several reactors are still overheating			0
in fact , @entity79 's nuclear safety agency has now raised the crisis to level 5 on the nuclear event scale			1
that 's the same rating as the partial meltdown of the nuclear plant at @entity151 in the @entity152 in 1979			0
but that may be a welcome comparison			0
at @entity151 , radioactive materials were contained within the reactors			0
no deaths were directly linked to the event , and fallout to the immediate community was measured to be harmless			0
still more than 30 years later , some people question the official version			2
just like @entity79 today there is a gap between what people are told and what they choose to believe			1
amid crisis , fact whispers and fear screams .			1

we are hard - wired to react with fear to what we do n't understand , @entity172 says
expert says there is a fear overload and a shortage of fact
officials in @entity79 have told people that radiation levels pose no risk to health
a caveat : this emergency is in uncharted territory
