this important leader handles the debt crisis with grace , navigating expertly between austerity and growth			2
the leader 's opponents grumble , more out of jealousy than genuine opposition , and loyal supporters hail the leader as a hero			2
the leader 's popularity soars ; re-election is not in question			2
meanwhile , unemployment is at an all - time low , and the leader 's nation is looking like its own island of prosperity , a beacon to a suffering continent			1
for president @entity24 , this is a daydream			1
for @entity27 chancellor @entity26 , this is life			1
funny how the most admired leader of the western world right now , the clearest example we have of consistent success during trying times , is a woman			1
the pictures in the news , day after day , tell the story : house speaker @entity37 looks like he has n't slept in weeks			0
senate minority leader @entity38 looks like he swallowed a lemon			0
sen. @entity40 looks bizarrely smug while the world crumbles around him , and @entity24 can only shake his head and loosen his collar			1
the only @entity45 type who was smiling on the front page of the newspaper this week was @entity49 , newly nominated by @entity24 to be the chair of the @entity51 , and anointed by one observer as the most powerful woman in world history			1
oh , and there was one other person smiling in @entity45 : @entity57 , chief of the @entity58 , who was in the @entity61 capital for the organization 's annual meeting and who said just about the only sensible thing anyone in town has said all week on the debt ceiling crisis : " i hope that in a few weeks ' time , we will look back and say , ' what a waste of time that was			1
' " this has not been a shining week for the patriarchy			0
the men in suits dither , posture , plan negotiation sessions and then cancel them , and employ copious military metaphors -- " wage battle , " " refuse to surrender " -- to no effect			0
increasingly they become associated in the minds of the @entity61 people with verbs normally used to describe toddlers , such as " tantrum " or " throw a fit			0
" competence , meanwhile belongs to the women , particularly in the usually macho world of global finance			1
over in @entity91 , @entity26 was re-elected on the basis of her deft handling of the eurozone crisis , and in the @entity61 , monetary policy was entrusted to @entity49			1
making the victory extra sweet for women , she was chosen instead of @entity98 , who will forever be remembered for saying women are n't that good at math. and this moment of female triumph extends beyond mere competence to unfathomable bravery			2
the hero of the moment -- the person who has been shot at , nearly killed and is still not afraid to talk -- is a heroine : 16 - year - old @entity105 , who was nominated for a @entity107 and who told @entity109 this week that if she were faced with a @entity111 gunman such as the one who shot her last year she would , once again , explain to him how important education is for girls			0
( in response @entity109 asked if he could adopt her			0
) perhaps this will be remembered as the week when everything shifted , when we realized that leaving groups of men in charge of global decisions and of facing down terrorists is not a good idea , and we 'd better calmly hand the reins over to the women			1
@entity57 described the transfer of power recently on a panel at the @entity132			2
she explained how women brought @entity128 out of its recession			0
after the economy crashed , " the banks , the funds , the government -- everything was taken over by women , " she told @entity137			0
" so when it 's messy , you get the women in			0
but when the mess is sorted , " she added , " keep the women			0

@entity146 : a leader guiding a nation to prosperity ? @entity24 ? no , @entity26 in @entity27
she says news full of dithering male leaders , while a woman has been picked to head the @entity51
she says competence in global leadership belongs to women like @entity58 chief @entity57
@entity146 : this may be the week when the world realizes women are better at the helm
