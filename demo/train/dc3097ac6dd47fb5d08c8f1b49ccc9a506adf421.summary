-- attorneys on both sides of the same - sex marriage debate faced off monday in a federal appeals court in @entity5 , as a panel of judges heard arguments about the constitutionality of @entity10			1
in august , a federal judge ruled that the voter - approved measure , which defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman , violated the @entity18 @entity17			1
the @entity19 considered an appeal of that judge 's ruling monday			2
the three - judge panel opened monday 's hearing with tough questioning of parties seeking to appeal the decision , including @entity28 and @entity29 , who 's a deputy clerk and deputy commissioner of civil marriages for @entity33 , @entity5 , where voters overwhelmingly approved @entity10			1
" what 's your best case to allow for your standing in federal court ? " one judge asked attorney @entity36 , representing @entity28			0
" your honor , i do n't have a case , " @entity36 responded , referring to relevant court cases			0
@entity36 later urged the panel to consider how the @entity5 @entity46 earlier ruled in favor of the voter - approved @entity10			1
" if you do n't agree with me that we have standing , " @entity36 told the court , " then i do urge you to answer the @entity5 @entity46 decision			0
" then judge @entity51 questioned attorney @entity52 , who represented @entity53 , about how a deputy clerk , instead of the clerk , could have legal standing in the appeal			0
after a lengthy exchange , @entity51 appeared frustrated and stated : " if you do n't know the answer , say so , as the prior attorney did			0
" in asserting that his client has standing in the appeal , @entity52 told the court that the county clerks are local officers , but they perform state functions such as civil marriages			0
monday 's arguments in @entity68 , @entity5 , were being divided into two hour - long sessions -- one over the legal standing of those appealing the decision , and one over the constitutionality of @entity10			2
monday 's hearing is the latest in a lengthy legal battle over same - sex marriage in @entity5			1
the state 's high court had allowed same - sex marriage , but then the 2008 @entity10 voter referendum passed with 52 percent of the vote			1
the @entity5 @entity46 subsequently allowed that initiative to stand , saying it represented the will of the people			0
two same - sex couples filed a federal challenge , saying the law violated 14th @entity89 constitutional protections of due process and equal protection			2
on august 4 , @entity18 district judge @entity92 agreed , ruling that the voter - approved ban on same - sex marriage violated the equal protection clause of the @entity18 @entity17			1
" @entity10 fails to advance any rational basis in singling out gay men and lesbians for denial of a marriage license , " @entity92 , who was appointed to the federal bench by former president @entity97 , wrote in his 136 - page opinion			2
" indeed , the evidence shows @entity10 does nothing more than enshrine in the @entity106 the notion that opposite - sex couples are superior to same - sex couples			2
" same - sex marriage is currently legal in five states and in the @entity112			1
the five states are @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117			0
@entity92 's landmark ruling led to a swift federal appeal that could ultimately reach the @entity46 .			0
