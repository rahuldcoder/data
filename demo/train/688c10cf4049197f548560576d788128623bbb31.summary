-- the 2014 midterm elections are quickly shaping up to be the most obscenely expensive ever			1
as more and more outside groups shell out an unlimited amount of campaign cash -- while accepting bottomless contributions from big business and anonymous wealthy donors -- stockpiling huge amounts of campaign cash has become a political arms race			1
even so , this is the year concerned @entity12 can begin to turn it all around and get big money out of politics			1
together , " we the people " can stamp out big money in politics			2
if we do n't act now , we 're in trouble			2
the @entity22 's @entity21 decision was a key ruling in opening up the gates to a torrent of spending by super pacs			1
outside groups spent a whopping $ 2 billion in the 2012 election cycle , according to @entity31 figures , compared with $ 298,549,659 in 2008			0
according to the @entity34 ' analysis of super pacs and politically active nonprofits , by november of last year these groups had burned through $ 20.6 million , more than three times the $ 6.3 million they 'd laid out by the same point in the last election			1
" dark money " organizations -- 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) and 501 ( c ) ( 6 ) nonprofits such as @entity42 or @entity43 , which are n't required to disclose the names of their donors -- have nearly quintupled their spending of two years ago			2
and right now , the nation is awaiting the @entity22 's decision in another case , @entity52 , which is challenging caps on the total amount that a wealthy donor can directly give to all pacs , campaigns and parties combined -- what 's known as " aggregate contribution limits			1
" if the court strikes down contribution limits , one affluent donor would be able to give more than $ 3 million in direct contributions			0
currently , individual donor contributions are capped at $ 123,200 -- more than double the median family income in @entity12			2
what 's one impact of all this money ? many @entity12 are becoming convinced that their votes do n't count , that our political process is controlled by the biggest bankroll , and that money , not the public interest , sets policies and priorities in government			1
big money gives a big voice to the wealthy and corporations , at the expense of the rest of us			2
it threatens the democratic voice that is the foundation of our country			2
freshman representatives in @entity89 are asked to spend nearly half their time raising money , many providing special interest lobbyists and elites with unprecedented access			0
these special interests can afford to pay $ 5,000 a plate for politicians ' fund - raising breakfasts , or for such things as ski trips , pheasant hunts and luxury golf tournaments			0
this access shapes the issues that members of @entity89 care about			0
it inevitably promotes a " pay to play " government that leaves other citizens out in the cold and makes the public increasingly cynical that elections matter			1
what are the steps we must take to restore our political process to one determined by " we the people " ? public financing of campaigns would restore the political voice of small contributors and the belief that the votes and voice of ordinary @entity12 count			1
last week , rep. @entity122 , @entity124 , and minority leader @entity125 , @entity126 , introduced " government by the people " legislation that will empower " we the people " as small donors to fight back against big money in politics			0
with a " @entity135 , " financed by closing corporate tax loopholes , the bill would give small donors a $ 25 refundable tax credit , and match contributions of $ 150 or less at a rate of 6 to 1			0
this effort is similar to a public finance measure introduced in @entity142 , and other jurisdictions also are looking at this public financing model			1
already 16 states , 500 municipalities and over 140 members of @entity89 are on record in support			0
while local and national advocates are driving key reforms , every citizen -- democrats , independents and @entity155 -- can help build the movement to get money out of politics by legally stamping messages like " not to be used for @entity160 " on their paper currency			0
on average , a dollar bill stays in circulation for approximately two and a half years and is seen by 875 people			0
so as more stamped bills enter the marketplace , we can create a massive visual demonstration of support for reforms -- support that our elected representatives will no longer be able to ignore			0
if we care about a truly representative government and political process , one that engages and encourages the electorate to participate , then we must take action to get big money out of politics			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 and @entity183 .			1

@entity182 , @entity183 : 2014 elections will see huge campaign donations , spending
they say @entity21 ruling helped open gates to flood of outside spending to sway vote
