-- the @entity2 race in @entity3 has it all : a popular incumbent @entity6 facing a primary challenge , a @entity6 feud , a generational divide , and @entity10 , one of the most polarizing figures in politics			1
@entity13 met with reporters in @entity15 on wednesday , one day after announcing her bid for the seat			2
it came on the same day that three - term @entity6 sen. @entity19 said he would run for re-election			1
" i 'm focused on earning every vote i can , the way it ought to be done in @entity3 , which is one person at a time , " @entity10 said			2
@entity19 says @entity3 voters will stick with him @entity10 , a former @entity27 official and @entity29 contributor , is the eldest daughter of the former vice president , who served for a decade as the congressman from @entity3			1
like her father , @entity10 is a very vocal critic of president @entity34			2
" president @entity34 has launched a war on our @entity38 rights			0
he has launched a war on our religious freedom			0
he has used the @entity42 to launch a war on our freedom of speech			0
he has used the @entity48 to launch a war on @entity3 's ranchers , farmers and energy industry , " said @entity10 in a statement announcing her bid			1
@entity0 chief national correspondent @entity53 , who covered the @entity54 over the years , says @entity13 has been a very loyal aide to her father			1
@entity13 announces @entity2 run " clearly she has his blessing or she would n't do it , " @entity53 said			1
" if her dad had turned to her and said ' do n't do this , ' she would n't have done this			0
in her putting her neck out , in her offending @entity19 and everyone else in the @entity63 , so has her dad			2
" @entity19 is a proven conservative but has been willing to try to accomplish bipartisan solutions in the @entity2			1
while not directly criticizing him in her announcement , @entity10 said , " i am running because i know as a mother and as a patriot , we can no longer afford simply to go along to get along			2
" and the 46 - year - old @entity10 appears to be making @entity19 's age an issue , saying , " i believe it is necessary for a new generation of leaders to step up to the plate			1
one veteran analyst of @entity2 races is n't sure the age argument will be effective			0
" she is running against an incumbent from her own party who has a solidly conservative voting record and is well - liked by voters			2
her theme seems to be @entity19 's age , but i do n't know that it will play that well , " said @entity84 , senior editor for the non-partisan @entity85			1
but the primary will highlight the ongoing struggle for the future of the @entity6			2
" this race now will be the highest - profile test of what 's happening in the @entity6 , the struggle over whether you fight and compromise or do you fight and keep fighting			1
this race will capture huge national attention , " @entity53 added			2
@entity19 says he 's not surprised he 's being challenged			1
" she 's been traveling around @entity3 for a long time , so i 'm not surprised			0
i 'm only surprised in that she said if i ran she would n't			2
she announced 30 minutes after i more specifically stated my intention , " @entity19 told @entity0 chief congressional correspondent @entity103 on wednesday			1
and he pushed back on his age , telling bash , " i 'm absolutely not too old to be a senator			0
i 'm about the median age for this body			0
i 'm in really good health , i 'm on the committees that i want to be on			0
" and @entity19 does n't think his ability to work with @entity118 is a liability , saying " i 've developed trust on both sides of the aisle , people trust me that what i say i 'm going to do , i do			1
" on tuesday @entity19 told reporters that he would n't change his plans to run for a fourth term , but admitted to reporters that fundraising has " always been a problem for me			1
" but he told @entity107 that people in @entity3 " complain about long campaigns			0
it does n't take them long to make up their mind			0
and it does n't cost a lot of money to have them make up their mind			0
" @entity19 appears to have the backing of the two other members of @entity3 's congressional delegation			1
" i think that @entity19 has done an excellent job representing the people of @entity3 and i 'm going to continue to work to support @entity19 , sen. @entity141 told @entity0 on wednesday			1
" i have a great deal of respect for the entire @entity10 family , for the vice president , for @entity13 and for @entity149 , but i think it 's the wrong race at the wrong time , " he said			1
@entity152 rep. @entity152 of @entity3 ripped @entity10 's decision as " bad form " and predicted she would lose in the @entity6 primary next year			1
" i do n't know that anybody can out - conservative @entity19 , " @entity152 told @entity0 senior congressional producer @entity155 and other reporters outside the @entity158 chamber on tuesday			1
the congresswoman , @entity3 's at - large representative , admitted @entity10 had the upper hand in raising money , but said that would n't matter			1
" she will outraise him by factors of 10 or more , and he will still win because @entity3 is grassroots , retail campaigning , " she said			0
the @entity168 was quick to say it stands firmly behind @entity19 , the @entity6 incumbent			1
" our mission is to re-elect our incumbents and build a @entity6 majority , " @entity168 communications director @entity169 told @entity0			1
@entity10 , who chairs a nonprofit on national security and education called @entity177 , had been rumored this year to be considering a @entity2 run			2
early last week , former sen. @entity179 of @entity3 told the @entity180 that a potential @entity10 primary challenge would bring about " the destruction of the @entity6 of @entity3 , " adding that , " it 's a disaster -- a divisive , ugly situation -- and all it does is open the door for the @entity118 for 20 years			1
" @entity186 had a different message after @entity10 's announcement on tuesday			1
" i deeply care about them both , " he said , according to the @entity189			0
@entity10 will come under attack for being a carpetbagger			2
she was born in @entity194 and grew up in @entity197 's @entity196 suburbs before attending college in @entity199 and law school in @entity201			0
she spent most of her career working in the nation 's capital before moving to @entity3 last year			0
@entity10 touted her family 's longtime @entity3 roots in a speech in may and in her announcement tuesday			2
he highlighted that her family " first came here in 1852 , in search of religious freedom , " adding that her grandmother " was raised in the @entity210 oil field and grew up to become @entity212 's first female deputy sheriff			0
" will the carpetbagger tag stick ? there have already been comparisons to @entity221			0
in 2000 the first lady , who grew up in @entity201 and lived for many years in @entity223 , successfully ran for the @entity2 in @entity224 , but faced the carpetbagger attacks			0
" what did @entity221 have ? she had national name identification			0
she had a giant fundraising network , she had a bunch of people willing to work for her and willing to fight and she ran a very effective campaign and she won , " @entity53 recalled			2
as for @entity10 , he said , " she will have money			0
she has the name identification			0
now the test is , since she 's new to politics , can she run a campaign			0
can she convince the people of @entity3 that she 's right			0
" @entity0 's @entity239 , @entity240 and @entity241 contributed to this story			0
