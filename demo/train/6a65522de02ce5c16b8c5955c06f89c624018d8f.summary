@entity0 , the ability to see things differently and come up with new breakthroughs , is n't some @entity5 - given gift to be enjoyed by the lucky few			1
it 's a natural part of human behavior			1
unfortunately , sometimes creativity gets blocked and we lose confidence in our own ability to create			1
@entity12 is one of the great psychologists : only @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 have been cited more			2
@entity17 is 86 now and he still works at @entity18			2
one day we met on campus and got to talking about this methodology he 'd developed to cure phobias , called " guided mastery			2
" i mean , @entity17 's methodology did n't just cure people with a lifelong fear of snakes ; it affected other parts of their lives			1
watch @entity32 's @entity31 : how to build your creative confidence @entity35 would invite the person with the fear of snakes into a room and say , " you know , there 's a snake in the next room and we 're going in there			1
" to which they usually responded , " hell no , i 'm not			0
" then he 'd have the person stand in front of a two - way mirror looking into the room where a friend of theirs was holding a snake			0
gradually , the person would start to feel more comfortable			0
many small steps later , eventually they would n't just be in standing in the same room as a snake , they 'd be wearing leather gloves , getting ready to actually touch one			1
and as soon as someone with a phobia of snakes actually touched a snake in that room , they were fine			0
@entity31 : @entity68 on nurturing creativity in fact , the people who had touched the snake ended up having less anxiety and more success elsewhere in their lives			1
they tried harder , they persevered longer , and they were more resilient in the face of failure			0
they had gained a new confidence in their ability to attain what they set out to do			2
@entity35 calls that confidence " self - efficacy , " and it could possibly change the world , one person at a time			1
well , meeting @entity17 was really cathartic for me , because i realized that this famous scientist had scientifically validated something we 'd been seeing for the last 30 years			0
at @entity93 and the d.school ( @entity18 's school of design ) , we meet people from all kinds of businesses			1
a lot of these highly skilled people have spent years honing their analytical , practical mind -- but they ca n't remember the last time they created something new			1
they say things like , " i 'm afraid i 'm just not the creative type			2
" we 've found that we can help people regain their creative confidence through a series of small successes that take fear and turn it into familiarity			1
even better , when people regain this creative confidence -- and we see it all the time at the d.school and at @entity93 -- we 've found that they start working on the things that are really important in their lives			1
they go in new directions			0
they come up with more interesting , more prolific ideas , so they can choose from better options			0
and they make better decisions			0
@entity31 : @entity127 says schools kill creativity to me , that journey to creative confidence looks like @entity133			1
@entity133 is a technical person			0
he designs life - saving , award - winning medical imaging equipment , mri machines , and he 's had a fantastic career at @entity138			1
but at one point @entity133 had a moment of crisis			0
he had come to a hospital to observe one of his mri machines in use and met a young family whose little girl was so terrified of the mri that she had to be sedated before getting a scan			2
then @entity133 found out she was n't the only one			2
nearly 80 percent of the pediatric patients in this hospital had to be sedated in order to deal with the scary mri machine			2
around that time he was taking classes at the d.school , learning about design thinking , about empathy , about iterative prototyping			0
and he decided to take his new creative confidence and do something quite extraordinary			1
he decided to redesign the entire experience of being scanned			0
he painted the walls and he painted the machine , and he had children 's museum people retrain the operators , and he turned the @entity170 experience into an adventure story for kids			1
now when a kid comes in , they 're in a story , not a machine			0
the operators say things like , " okay , you 're going to go into the pirate ship , but be very still because we do n't want the pirates to find you			2
" because of @entity133 's @entity170 redesign , this pediatric ward went from 80 percent of the kids needing to be sedated , to something like 10 percent			2
the hospital and @entity138 were happy too , because less anesthesiologist time meant more patients could finish in one day			0
so the quantitative results were great			0
but the results that @entity133 cared about were much more qualitative : he was waiting with a young family one day when a little girl came out of her scan , ran up to her mother , and said , " @entity197 , can we come back tomorrow ? " @entity31 : 5 dangerous things you should let your kids do @entity133 's story takes place in a hospital			2
i know a thing or two about hospitals , too			0
a few years ago i felt a lump on the side of my neck , and it was my turn in the mri machine			1
i was told i had a 40 percent chance of survival			0
so while you 're sitting around with the other patients in your pajamas and everybody 's pale and thin and you 're waiting for your turn to get the gamma rays , you think about a lot of things			1
mostly you think about , " am i going to survive ? " but you think about other things , too , like , " what was i put on @entity225 to do ? " at this point i knew that if i survived , my purpose was to help as many people as possible regain the creative confidence they lost along their way			1
so i hope you 'll join me on my quest			0
let 's not let people divide the world into the creatives and the non-creatives , like it 's some @entity5 - given thing			1
let 's help people realize that they 're naturally creative , and they should let their ideas fly			1
achieve what @entity12 calls self - efficacy			0
find the belief that you can do what you set out to do			0
believe that you can reach a place of creative confidence			1
follow @ @entity249 on twitter			0

@entity32 : creativity is n't something that only a few can do , it 's natural human behavior
he says sometimes creativity gets blocked and we lose the confidence to create
a series of small successes can help people develop creative confidence , he says
@entity267 : creativity can turn the world around , as it did at an mri unit for sick children
