-- one year ago , @entity3 fruit vendor @entity1 torched himself out of economic despair , and the news of his desperate act spread like a brushfire across the @entity9 country , through the rest of the @entity12 world and around the globe			1
his plight touched a chord in @entity3 , stirring popular anger and protest			2
less than a month after the self - immolation , @entity3 president @entity18 was ousted from power			1
the @entity3 revolution emboldened @entity22			1
@entity23 , director of the @entity24 and fellow at the @entity26 , constantly heard about @entity1 and @entity3 in the @entity22 capital of @entity28			1
they could n't believe that such open protest to a long - standing dictatorship could unfold			2
subsequently , an @entity22 uprising took hold and president @entity34 was ousted from power			1
in another corner of the @entity12 world , @entity36 , a @entity37 activist , said the self - immolation and the ouster of @entity18 stunned his fellow @entity37 because citizens actually confronted " a police state , where you can not react			1
" after months of massive demonstrations , @entity37 's president @entity45 is now on his way out of office under a power transition plan brokered by a coalition of @entity51			2
" i think he resonated everywhere , " @entity23 said			0
" as the narrative was told , as the story was told it did strike a chord with so many @entity12			0
" @entity1 was an unknown street vendor struggling to feed his family by selling fruit , earning the equivalent of barely $ 10 a day as he pushed his cart through the streets of @entity62 in central @entity3			1
@entity3 on life one year later : no fear on the morning of december 17 , a female municipal inspector named @entity66 accosted @entity1			1
an altercation erupted during which the inspector seized @entity1 's produce			1
after the incident , the humiliated fruit vendor repeatedly tried and failed to get the attention of town officials			0
finally , he purchased fuel , doused himself with it , and lit a lethal flame outside the gates of the governorate building			0
" these government inspectors used to confiscate our goods and demand bribes , " says @entity1 's uncle @entity81 , who also operates a fruit cart in downtown @entity83			1
" it was because of their tyranny that @entity1 set himself on fire			2
" almost immediately , protests erupted in @entity62 and then quickly spread to other cities and towns across the country			0
@entity1 died of his injuries in a hospital on january 4			2
on saturday , thousands of @entity3 gathered in the streets of @entity62 to celebrate the first anniversary of the uprising			1
a monument featuring @entity1 's fruit stand was inaugurated and political leaders honored the man for his sacrifice			1
" thank you @entity62 , for the freedom we enjoy today , " said @entity3 's new president , @entity105			1
@entity109 , a professor at the @entity110 and the @entity111 in @entity112 , said @entity1 was " definitely the catalyst of the @entity3 revolt , which due to its success catalyzed the @entity22 uprising			1
" " the incident went viral because of the intense global media coverage of the @entity3 revolt , " @entity109 said			1
" every time the unfolding events were covered , readers , listeners and viewers were reminded of the fruit vendor who immolated himself and became a symbol for a population fed up with injustice and oppression			0
" @entity3 journalist @entity129 , who is one of the founders of a news website called tunisia - live.net and is a stringer for @entity0 , said local politicians helped forge the image of @entity1 and it evolved into what has become a " universal story			1
" as protests unfolded after @entity1 's self - immolation , the government could have reacted the way politicians do in the @entity142 and other @entity144 nations , @entity129 said			1
they could have staved off popular discontent by immediately promising to look into the incident and its underlying causes and come up with a solution			0
but instead , @entity129 said , the government cracked heads and shot protesters			0
" the government lost the battle when they used real bullets in a country where we did not see a gun			0
here we have the government shooting people with real bullets			0
that was something that fueled the insurgency , " @entity129 said			0
@entity164 , @entity9 researcher at @entity165 , said there were other incidents in @entity3 that " could have lit the flame , " but this one united a series of elements with which people could identify , such as day - to - day injustices and police harassment			1
@entity1 was part of a younger generation that saw no future and he came from the interior of the county , a region long neglected and the object of contempt , @entity164 said			2
" he was @entity182 , " @entity164 said			0
" there had been other self - immolations			2
this one just captured the imagination of @entity3 , both the elites and the ordinary tunisians			1
" @entity164 said it soon dawned on people across the region that if @entity3 could oust their dictator , they could do it , too			2
" it 's not just the @entity195 example			2
it was the whole @entity3 thing that happened so quickly that inspired them			2
" the protests that began after @entity1 's death were apolitical and spurred by the lack of jobs			1
but the president claimed the protests were stirred by terrorists and outsiders , and the government cracked down , a reaction that reflected a regime that never faced " genuine challenges from below , " @entity164 said			0
" tunisians were repelled by that kind of explanation , " he said			0
even though @entity18 eventually visited @entity195 in the hospital and said he 'd create more jobs , the damage was done			0
" every step of the way he had to catch up , but he was always five steps behind , " @entity164 said of @entity18			0
@entity23 said @entity1 was seen as a man who struggled and tried to do the right thing , @entity23 said , but he was n't born into the right clan or elite and was under the thumb of a dictatorial regime			2
the fact that he was a well - known market vendor also contributed to his story , @entity23 said , noting that " he was somebody quite well liked and struggling			0
market vendors get to know a lot of people			0
that contributed to his recognition			0
" like much of the @entity12 world , he was a young person who had to contend with a tilted playing field			0
@entity36 said the uprisings across the @entity12 world would have happened with or without @entity1 's act , noting that this " did n't come out of the blue			1
" it was a " boiling point " reflecting the range of indignities common across the region			0
outside the @entity12 world , people watched the uprisings unfold			0
@entity1 posthumously received the @entity249 's @entity248 , one of five winners honored for their role in the @entity253			1
the once - unknown fruit vendor 's actions stirred hope and courage , and that , @entity23 said , is part of his legacy			2
" if there are certain actions these regimes are taking which are beyond the pale , people are not willing to accept that , " @entity23 said .			0
