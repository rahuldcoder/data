@entity0 -- the @entity2 dramatically expanded its evacuation warnings near the troubled @entity5 nuclear reactors wednesday , telling @entity2 to get at least 50 miles away			1
the earlier recommendation from both the @entity2 and @entity5 governments was to stay 12 miles away or to take shelter indoors if evacuation was not possible within an 18 - mile radius			1
the @entity2 change came wednesday afternoon in @entity0 but in the middle of the night in @entity13			0
it was the first time since the march 11 earthquake and tsunami in @entity5 triggered the nuclear crisis that the @entity2 and @entity5 governments have differed on advising what their citizens should do			1
before wednesday , the @entity2 had urged @entity2 citizens in @entity5 to follow the recommendations of the @entity5 government			1
the new @entity2 recommendation " suggests that the advice the @entity5 government is giving based on the information it has is different than the advice we 'd be giving if this incident happened in the @entity2 , " @entity26 spokesman @entity25 told reporters in @entity0			1
" their standards are different from ours based on how far you should evacuate , " he said , calling the situation in @entity5 " very fluid			0
" @entity40 spokesman @entity39 echoed @entity25 , saying that the @entity2 has confidence in @entity5 authorities but wanted to put out the new information about the crisis based on the evaluation of @entity2 experts and what they would propose in a similar crisis inside the @entity2			2
" this is not any kind of judgment on what the @entity5 authorities are telling their public , " @entity39 said at a mid-afternoon briefing at the @entity40			0
" this is based on what we would advise @entity2 citizens here to do in a similar situation			2
so we are compelled based on that estimate , based on that appraisal , to advise @entity2 citizens in @entity5 to do the same			1
' the decision on widening the exclusion area lagged behind the @entity2 military , which had kept military personnel from operating within 50 miles of the damaged nuclear plant " days ago , " according to @entity67 spokesman col. @entity66			1
@entity40 officials could not explain why the military was concerned about @entity2 military operating in the area but the @entity40 did not feel a need to warn @entity2 citizens until early thursday in @entity5			1
just before the evacuation recommendation had changed , the @entity2 ambassador to @entity5 had told journalists that the @entity2 was in full agreement with the @entity5			2
" our experts are in agreement with the response and measures taken by @entity5 technicians , including their recommended 20 - kilometer ( 12 - mile ) radius for evacuation and additional shelter - in - place recommendations out to 30 kilometers ( 18 miles ) , " ambassador @entity76 told journalists at a briefing in @entity13 wednesday afternoon			2
despite the major change , @entity39 said the widening of the evacuation area should not be viewed as any shift of confidence in @entity5			0
" we feel we are cooperating effectively with the @entity5 government and that we are communicating , " @entity39 said			0
the @entity40 is coordinating with other governments about helping people leave the areas devastated by the earthquake and tsunami as well as by the crisis at the nuclear plants			0
but despite earlier @entity2 statements that there were 160,000 americans in @entity5 , @entity39 said no specific numbers were available			0
and he would not predict whether the @entity2 would take steps to bring members of its diplomatic team and families back to the @entity2 " we are looking at all contingencies but i have no more to say on that			0
posture has n't changed , " @entity39 said .			0
