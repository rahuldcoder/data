the case of three teenage @entity2 girls , who are believed to have traveled to @entity3 to join @entity4 , has refocused attention on the @entity9 extremist group 's appeal to young people			1
children and young people feature in the terrorist group 's propaganda , including a recent video showing boys in camouflage and @entity4 bandanas learning hand - to - hand combat			1
the militants call them their " @entity21			0
" experts say @entity4 has especially ramped up its efforts to lure young women -- seen as potential brides for its fighters -- into the territory under its brutal control in @entity3 and @entity30			1
but that still leaves the question of why its recruitment drive appears to be proving so successful			1
" there 's no question what we 're combating with @entity4 's propaganda machine is something we have not seen before , " @entity35 spokeswoman @entity34 told @entity5			1
" it 's something we need to do a lot more work on			2
we are seeing 90,000 , i think , tweets a day that we 're combating			0
" the militants have repeatedly promoted videos using high - level production techniques to celebrate their brutality			0
a short mash - up clip in september played like a trailer for an action movie , with slow - motion explosions and flames engulfing @entity56 troops			0
@entity2 surveillance chief @entity57 has said @entity4 and other extremist groups use platforms like @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 to reach their target audience in a language it understands			1
their methods include exploiting popular hashtags to disseminate their message , he said			0
@entity4 also use its @entity70 recruits to promote the cause to other people like them back home			1
and the extremist group is putting a particular focus on girls , analysts say			0
" we 're seeing young women from across @entity70 countries both expressing their support for and migrating to @entity3 now in totally unprecedented numbers , " said @entity78 , chief executive of the @entity79			1
" and i would say this is the result really of an extremely sophisticated propaganda recruitment machinery that 's targeting young women very specifically			1
" how @entity4 makes ( and takes ) money analysts say that @entity4 can appeal to young people 's religious idealism and to a desire to escape the frustrations of life in the @entity93			1
" @entity4 provides a utopian political project , the so - called caliphate , the centralized @entity9 rule , " @entity94 said			2
" @entity4 provides these deluded young men and women with an adventurous trip			1
" as a reward for allegiance , @entity4 loyalists receive gifts from @entity105 including " a house with free electricity and water provided to you due to the @entity110 ( the caliphate or state ) and no rent included , " according to @entity114 , a @entity2 teenager who left @entity115 to join @entity4 in 2013			2
" sounds great , right ? " writes @entity116 , who now appears to blog about life under @entity4 rule and is believed to have communicated with one of the three @entity2 girls who recently left for @entity3			2
@entity116 offers assurances to women who might be worried about roughing it : " you can find shampoos , soaps and other female necessities here , so do not stress if you think you will be experiencing some cavewoman life here			2
" @entity70 officials , though , say that @entity4 is pushing a false narrative of what it 's really like in its territory			1
people who heed its call " erroneously believe they are going out to help people , " said @entity134 , a @entity2 lawmaker			0
" and they do n't think @entity4 is doing anything wrong because they think @entity4 is helping people in their sort of warped thinking			2
" everything to know about the rise of @entity4 " it took so little time for these three young , innocent , vulnerable girls to from the heart of @entity151 to the heart of @entity153 -- and probably they are in areas controlled either by @entity4 or other militant groups , " said @entity94 , referring to the @entity2 teenagers			1
he stressed " the important presence of a person who basically serves as a middleman or middlewoman between young men and women in the @entity93 and @entity4 militants in @entity30 and @entity3			1
" @entity56 investigators studied the case of three teenage @entity165 girls who tried to join @entity4 last year to learn more about how the militant group recruits young people in the @entity93			1
the @entity168 found examples of @entity93 already in the @entity4 fold who were communicating directly with new recruits via social media			2
believed to be operating from @entity153 , @entity3 and @entity30 , the online recruiters helped provide how - to guides for @entity93 who are inclined to travel and join the @entity4 fight , officials said			2
but even after identifying them , officials could n't see a clear path to arresting them			0
most are thought to be out of reach of @entity56 law enforcement			0
how @entity4 is run social media services may have been largely invented in the @entity93 , but @entity4 is outflanking governments in how it uses the platforms			1
" we are way behind			0
they are far superior and advanced than we are when it comes to new media technologies , " @entity189 , a former jihadi and author of " radical : my journey out of @entity193 , " told @entity5 last year			0
@entity2 prime minister @entity194 has said the case of the three @entity2 girls highlights the need to fight @entity4 on multiple fronts			2
" it needs every school , every university , every college , every community to recognize they have a role to play , we all have a role to play in stopping people from having their minds poisoned by this appalling death cult , " he said			0
the @entity56 government is trying to step up its efforts to counter @entity4 propaganda by beefing up a small @entity35 agency to make it the heart of the fight against the militants ' messaging			1
" we 're seeing their approaches continue to evolve , " @entity34 told @entity5			0
" we need to continue to make sure ours are evolving and we 're combating it in the most strategic way and using every interagency resource			0
" but she acknowledged that the @entity56 still has a lot to do			0
" we 're really going to pick it up now , " @entity34 said			0
" we have new people in charge of the office			0
and we will see what happens over the coming months			0
" from @entity115 teen to @entity4 bride and recruiter @entity5 's @entity230 contributed to this report .			1

@entity4 has " an extremely sophisticated propaganda recruitment machinery , " analyst says
it 's particularly focusing efforts on luring young women to its territory
