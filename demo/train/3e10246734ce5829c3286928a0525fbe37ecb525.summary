-- @entity1 is perhaps the only athlete apart from @entity2 who has had a technique named after him			0
@entity1 : the strongest man ever ? while @entity2 was throwing himself backward over the bar in the high jump in @entity6 1968 , @entity1 was placing his ankles together , instead of apart , for the lifting snatch			0
the " @entity19 " was also coined " @entity20 " after the stance the lifter adopts before the pull : heels together with knees fanned outward to around sixty degrees with a wide grip on the bar , resembling a frog upon the lift			0
the technique proved physiologically efficient for a body bearing some 60 kilograms ( 132 pounds ) of stress			0
@entity1 's @entity25 gold in 1968 is less well known than @entity2 's , but pound for pound , in his own sport , he is considered one of the strongest men who ever lived -- and @entity31 's finest weightlifting exponent			1
the medal re-affirmed @entity1 's pre-eminence in the featherweight class and proved he could travel			2
in 1964 he had also won gold in @entity36 in front of a home crowd , improving on a silver earned in @entity40 in 1960			2
born in @entity41 in @entity42 , north of @entity36 , in 1939 , @entity1 was all but unstoppable in the mid- 1960s			1
