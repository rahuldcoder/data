-- are you clamoring for the real @entity3 officials yet ? if not , just wait and then prepare to issue an apology to one of the most unjustly crucified groups in society this side of baseball umpires			1
for starters , the @entity3 's exhibition season was filled with gaffes , bloopers and worse than that involving its collection of replacement officials			1
issues with spotting the football			0
plus , in a game between the home - team @entity24 and the @entity25 , the referee kept saying " @entity27 " instead of " @entity24 " when addressing the crowd			1
so it was somewhat of a relief that during the @entity3 's season opener wednesday night between the @entity32 and the @entity33 , the replacement officials were -- well , ok			1
there were no glaring blunders , and none of the new guys tripped over the 50 - yard line			0
still , as former @entity3 director of officials @entity41 told @entity42 , " one game does n't make a week , but it was definitely a good start			1
we 'll all know more come tuesday morning			0
" by then , the @entity3 's other 30 teams will have spent their opening game with these replacement officials who primarily work for @entity50 and @entity51 colleges			1
they were hired by the @entity3 courtesy of the league 's ongoing lockout of the regular officials			1
the labor dispute is over money and other matters , and it has lasted for months			0
will replacement refs mar @entity3 's first week ? not only that , @entity3 commissioner @entity61 suggested during an open forum with fans at league headquarters in @entity65 before the @entity32 - @entity33 game that he is willing to continue with the replacements to achieve a long - term solution			1
as for the short term , there is encouraging news for those who know replacement officials are just a ticking bomb waiting to explode with a slew of errors			1
and , no , the encouraging news is n't that both sides will punt away their labor squabbles anytime soon			0
the only silver ( or shall we say black - and - white striped ) lining is , the more the @entity3 uses replacement officials , the more folks will see the original ones were better than they thought			1
@entity88 negotiator : @entity3 referees wo n't start season i 'm talking about @entity91 better			1
this does n't apply just to @entity3 officials , but to those of the @entity95 , the @entity96 and even baseball umpires , who have been known to have a few nose - to - nose chats with managers and players			1
for every time that an @entity95 referee goes blind when a @entity104 shoves away a @entity105 to sink a jumper to clinch a world championship , there are tens , hundreds and thousands of calls that are dead - on target			0
the same goes for baseball , where you 've had the likes of umpire @entity114 ruining a perfect game for @entity116 by calling a base runner safe when he actually was out			2
then in the @entity96 , there was @entity120 's nonwhistle last season when the @entity123 ' @entity122 clearly was offside during a goal in a playoff game			1
the league issued a public apology to the losing @entity128 for the @entity130 gaffe , which was rare for @entity96 bosses to admit an officiating mistake			0
in fact , it is rare for those in charge of the other three major pro sports leagues in @entity138 to do such a thing			0
there is no need to apologize when your regular officials give you no reason to do so more often than not			1
in contrast , history has n't been kind to replacement officials			1
you can start with 1979 , when baseball swapped its striking umpires with minor league umpires , who quickly felt the wrath of everybody in their new world for brutal calls			1
when the 45 - day strike ended , baseball retained eight of the replacements , but they were shunned forever on and off the field by the returning umpires and derisively called " scabs			1
" the @entity95 went the replacement route for 68 days during the 1995 season , and that was to the chagrin of those who disliked a massive increase in the amount of fouls called in games			1
at one point , the @entity173 ' @entity172 spoke boldly for his peers , telling reporters , " they used five of these ( replacements ) to equal one of the regular refs			2
" but back to the @entity3 , where i called @entity182 for some perspective on this officiating thing			1
he ranks among the league 's all - time wise men , since he spent four decades in the @entity3 as an accomplished player , coach and administrator along the way to six @entity192			1
he also was associated with two of the @entity3 's most famous games -- as in the likely breeding grounds for officiating gaffes			1
there was the 1967 @entity3 championship game , which became known as the @entity199			2
with the temperature in @entity201 , @entity202 , at minus - 15 below zero and a wind - child factor of minus 48 , @entity182 was a running back for a @entity32 team that eventually lost to the @entity206 during the frantic , famous and frigid last seconds			0
then there was @entity209 in 1987 , when @entity210 led a @entity212 team coached by @entity213 yards to victory inside the final minutes of the afc championship game in @entity216			2
any blown calls in either of those games ? @entity182 is still thinking			0
" golly , i do n't remember anything that stuck out , " said @entity182 , still thinking from his home in @entity220			0
then @entity182 recalled the @entity223 championship game in @entity224 after the 1998 regular season , when the @entity24 team he coached won an overtime thriller against the @entity228			1
he forced a chuckle , saying , " no , i ca n't think of anything during that game , either			2
" you get the point			0
oh , @entity182 does remember his version of a phantom " chop block " called by an @entity3 official against offensive lineman @entity238 when @entity182 coached the @entity33 in the early 1990s			2
he also remembers what he said was a shaky call after a kickoff during @entity242 in 1988 , when his @entity212 lost to the @entity243			0
@entity182 laughed , saying , " yeah			0
you do have some bad calls that stick out , but i 'll tell you what			0
when you 've been involved in the @entity3 for 39 years , and when you can only think of maybe a handful of calls -- if that -- that you can say , ' well , gosh			2
we lost that game because of a bad call or something , ' i tell you right now : there are n't many of those			2
those ( regular ) officials do a great job , no question about it			2
" that said , @entity182 is n't totally against the replacements			0
as a traditionalist , he does n't believe coaches or players should concentrate on the quality of officials , period			0
" i know when i played for @entity269 ( @entity271 ) @entity270 ( with the @entity32 during the 1960s ) , and when i coached , we did n't spent a whole lot of time on the officials , " @entity182 said			0
" but as far as these new guys , there are a lot of them out there who just need an opportunity			0
you 'll miss the experience , though , and they 'll be taking more time making calls			0
the good thing is , the replay officials are n't on strike			2
they 'll have them as a backup			0
" but will they be as good as the guy who has been there doing for eight , nine , 10 years ? i do n't think so ? " which is much of the point			0
replacement refs bad business for @entity3 ?			2
