an attorney for rep. @entity1 is raising the prospect of a long , drawn - out battle over control of his @entity7 - area district , a seat once held by his former boss @entity9 , as his contest with @entity12 @entity11 looks increasingly likely to head to a recount			1
@entity14 , @entity1 's legal counsel , said wednesday that the campaign is n't taking " anything off the table " in potentially challenging the outcome of the race when it 's certified next month			1
" there are lots of potential options			2
there is the ability to file an election contest under state law			0
there 's a recount that goes forward , and as we 've seen in other states that can affect the outcome of the election , " he said			0
" there 's a range of options and we 're not taking anything off the table			1
" @entity11 , as of the last vote tally , leads @entity1 by just 161 votes , a margin that will trigger an automatic recount after the state certifies the vote dec. 1			1
but @entity1 's campaign has identified more than 130 ballots in @entity47 they say were illegitimately thrown out , and say there are likely others			1
the campaign attempted to delay the vote certification in @entity47 and requested those ballots be included , but the request was denied tuesday			0
and while they 're pursuing another delay in the district 's other county because of similar ballot issues on thursday , democrats admit they 're not optimistic it will be granted			0
democrats wo n't publicly address the prospect of pursuing legal options in the race , and @entity14 declined to comment specifically on what those options might be			0
but he at times compared the situation in @entity70 's 2nd district to sen. @entity72 's ( @entity73 ) 2008 reelection legal fight , which dragged on for more than eight months			1
" in the @entity72 recount , there was an effort to add in wrongfully rejected ballots in the recount and we can talk about that if we get to that point , " @entity14 said			0
under state law , however , @entity1 would have to wait to file a legal challenge until after the secretary of state has certified the results of the election , which is due dec. 1			2
in the meantime , @entity11 is already moving forward with her duties as though congresswoman - elect			2
she arrived in @entity89 this week for freshman orientation , and her spokesman said she 's " very confident " her lead will hold after the entire process is through			0
@entity1 's seat is just one of a handful not yet called from this year 's midterms			1
two @entity99 races in @entity100 are going to runoffs next month , and two @entity99 races in @entity102 are still too close to call .			0
