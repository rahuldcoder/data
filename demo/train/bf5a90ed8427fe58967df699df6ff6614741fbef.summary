-- an 8 - year - old @entity2 boy is caught in the middle of an ugly custody battle so high profile that secretary of state @entity6 is using her clout to try to bring the boy home			1
@entity12 's legal battle to gain custody of his son has drawn the attention of secretary of state @entity6			1
in 2004 , @entity12 dropped off his wife , @entity16 , and then - 4 - year - old son , @entity17 , at the airport for a two - week vacation in @entity20			1
shortly after she arrived in her native country , @entity16 told @entity12 she wanted a divorce and planned to stay in @entity20 with their son			1
@entity16 later remarried and got pregnant , but she died while giving birth last summer			1
@entity12 thought he was getting his son back , but a @entity20 family court judge granted custody of @entity17 to @entity16 's new husband			1
@entity12 talked with @entity0 's @entity29 about the international legal battle he is waging to gain custody of his son			1
@entity29 also talked to @entity31 , @entity32 's uncle			2
the following is an edited version of the interviews			0
@entity29 : what caused the breakup of the marriage ? @entity12 : i do n't know			1
apparently , she decided she wanted to live in @entity20 , where she said she had more friends and more family and where she was known			1
@entity29 : did you feel happily married ? @entity45 : yes , i thought we were happily married			0
@entity29 : so this was a call out of the blue ? @entity45 : i was completely blindsided and crushed			0
@entity29 : what did you do then ? @entity45 : well , i ( got ) a phone call			0
my mom tracked it down as being @entity53 , about three days after they arrived			0
the first call was they got there safe , everything was ok			0
then , i got a phone call and a very serious voice -- a voice they did n't recognize , really , as being , you know , it was out of her normal tone			0
@entity16 says , " @entity12 , we need to talk			1
you 're a great guy			0
you 're a wonderful father , but our love affair is ended , is over			0
i 've decided i want to live in @entity20 and you need to come down to @entity20 immediately and sign 10 pages of papers with my attorney			1
" there was a list of demands on these papers			0
one was giving her full custody			1
another was to never go to the courts to file any claims of kidnapping or criminal charges			0
@entity29 : did you get to talk to your son ? @entity45 : i got to talk to my son			2
in fact , i got to speak with all of them in the beginning , while they were still trying to get me to go down there and be trapped in this custody battle			2
at that point , i was n't the enemy until i did n't meet her demands and i did go to the courts			0
@entity29 : well , when you went ( to @entity20 ) , who did you see ? what did you do ? @entity45 : i went to the courts			1
i went to every ruling on every court proceeding and with the guise that they would honor the @entity107 and return ( my ) son			1
and every time , it just got worse and worse			0
in the first instance , they kept @entity17 for over a year before they made this ruling			0
and then they said , ' well , you know , yes , he was taken unlawfully and he should have been returned , but now he 's settled with the mother			2
these are @entity20 judges who have admitted that he 's been held unlawfully and wrongfully			1
@entity29 : how did you hear she died ? @entity45 : i have friends who , kind of , have an ear to the ground in @entity20 , and there were some articles that came out in some local @entity20 newspapers and they did some on the @entity129 and said she 'd passed away			1
@entity29 : did you try then to get the child back legally ? @entity45 : yes			2
as soon as i was notified , i called both counsel in @entity20 and in the @entity2 , and they said it should be over			1
you know , we have stacks of court records and all these treaties and it 's always been about @entity16 and @entity12 , @entity139 and @entity140			1
there 's no more @entity16			1
by all matters of law , international and national and @entity20 law , no one has a legal claim of custody but the living , biological parent			1
go down to @entity20 and bring your son home			1
@entity29 : what happened in court ? @entity45 : in this past court , we finally got a visitation ruling			2
but when i went down the first time to bring my son home , we find out that this man does n't file custody , but he files to remove my name from a @entity20 birth certificate that they had issued for my son , who was born in @entity168 , @entity169			1
and with that , they gave him a provisionary guardianship -- a provisionary			0
@entity29 : obviously , he wanted the boy ? @entity45 : obviously			0
@entity29 : when you were ( with him ? @entity45 : oh , he was -- i just saw him this last february for the first time			0
@entity29 : at eight years old , did he ask you why he 's not with you ? @entity45 : he asked why i have n't come to see him in all this time			1
and that was very , very painful -- and the anguish on his face when he asked me that question			2
and i did n't want to tell him that the situation that i 'm not allowed -- that they were n't allowing me , they 're holding him			0
so i just told him that i had been there many times with his grandmother , with his grandfather , with his cousins , with family friends to see him , sometimes staying for up to two weeks and the courts -- it was difficult			0
@entity29 : how long did you have with him ? @entity45 : i saw him for two days a total of about six hours			0
@entity29 : how did you say goodbye ? @entity45 : it was very , very difficult			0
i just kept telling him the whole time how much i love him , how much i miss him			0
@entity29 : did you tell him you were going to try to get him back ? @entity45 : no. i told him i 'm going to always try to be with him			0
i do n't want him to be put in any type of awkward situation or uncomfortable situation			0
i just told him i love him , i miss him and everyone at home loves him			0
and he remembers things at home			0
@entity29 : secretary of state @entity6 has raised the @entity45 case with the @entity20 government			1
anything you 'd say to her ? @entity45 : i 'm just -- i 'm so grateful and thankful that -- that she 's helping me and she knows what 's right and sees what 's right and she cares about children and parents ' rights to be with their own flesh and blood			2
- - - - - - - - - - - - @entity29 followed the @entity45 interview by talking to @entity31 , @entity32 's uncle			2
@entity29 : why do you think that @entity12 should not have his son ? why should n't he have his -- it 's his son			1
@entity225 : that 's right			2
and i do n't question the biological right			0
the fact of the matter is that in order to be a parent , you have to be more than just a dna donor , mr. @entity29			0
fatherhood is not about making home movies and taking pictures , it 's about sacrifice			2
it 's about providing support to your child			1
it 's about being there even when you 're not there			2
and mr. @entity12 , while @entity16 was still alive , failed to do so			1
i 'm not sure if you know that , but he has n't paid one single dime of child support so far			2
and he has been making allegations all over the place about us not allowing him to visit his child			2
@entity29 : do you question whether @entity12 loves his child ? @entity225 : oh , absolutely			1
i think that it 's really easy to say that you love someone , but you have to act and show that			2
mr. @entity12 never had any interest on actually going down to @entity20 , even to visit			1
i mean the child is not guilty of his parents ' mistakes			2
i mean divorces happen all the time			0
and the parents should be responsible and work their way toward finding an agreement in which , you know , both parents are part of the children 's lives			2
and he failed to do that because it was not in his best interests			0
@entity29 : how close is he [ @entity17 's stepfather ] with @entity17 ? @entity225 : very close			1
@entity17 knows exactly that he is not his biological father , but he also calls him daddy			0
@entity17 knows that , you know , mr. @entity12 is his biological father			1
even though it was not mentioned during this interview , @entity17 normally talks to mr. @entity12 or at least used to talk to mr. @entity12 and also her -- his grandmother here in the @entity2			1
so he knows exactly the difference			0
he knows exactly who is who .			0

@entity16 later remarried , died while giving birth
