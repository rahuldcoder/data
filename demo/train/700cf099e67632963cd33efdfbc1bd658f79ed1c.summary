@entity0 -- imagine a night flight , 30,000 feet in the air , and being able to stare up at the stars through the plane 's transparent fuselage			1
this will be the flying experience in 40 years time , according to aircraft manufacturer @entity9			1
the @entity11 giant unveiled its @entity12 tuesday in @entity0 , ahead of next week 's " @entity13 " @entity14			1
the cabin is part of its research project entitled " a vision of aviation in 2050			0
" @entity14 set for take - off @entity9 says the @entity12 is " inspired by nature " and will be 100 % recyclable with " self - cleaning materials made from sustainable plant fibres which reduce waste and maintenance and will harvest passenger body heat to power cabin features			1
" the body of the aircraft has a structure that @entity9 says " mimics the efficiency of bird bone which is optimized to provide strength where needed			1
" a " wall membrane " will enclose the cabin and become transparent to give passengers panoramic views of the sky			0
" our research shows that passengers of 2050 will expect a seamless travel experience while also caring for the environment , " said @entity39 , @entity9 executive vice president engineering			2
