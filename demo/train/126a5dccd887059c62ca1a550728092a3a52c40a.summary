plans to reduce the number of @entity7 troops in @entity8 to 50,000 by the end of this month are on schedule , @entity3 told the national convention of @entity17			1
at that point , the @entity7 mission will shift to the training and support of @entity8 security forces			2

" as a candidate for president , i pledged to bring the war in @entity8 to a responsible end			2
and that is exactly what we are doing			0
" while the @entity7 military commitment in @entity8 is now nearing a conclusion , the president warned , there is still danger there for @entity7 troops on the ground			1
" the hard truth is we have not seen the end of @entity7 sacrifice in @entity8 , " @entity3 said			1
" but make no mistake , our commitment in @entity8 is changing -- from a military effort led by our troops to a civilian effort led by our diplomats			2
" @entity3 's update on the conflict in @entity8 came in the context of a wide - ranging speech addressing several issues tied to national security and veterans ' benefits			1
@entity3 defended his decision to increase @entity7 military commitment in @entity62 -- a decision criticized by some of the more liberal members of his own party			1
he said the military has now gone on the offensive against extremist elements , and took issue with critics who claim the @entity7 end game in @entity62 remains poorly defined			2
" we face huge challenges in @entity62 , " he said			0
" but it 's important that the @entity7 people know that we are making progress and we 're focused on goals that are clear and achievable			0
" " if @entity62 were to be engulfed by an even wider insurgency , @entity79 and its terrorist affiliates would have even more space to plan their next attack			0
" " as president of the @entity7 , i refuse to let that happen , " he said			0
the @entity89 government has begun to " take the fight to violent extremists within its borders			0
major blows have been struck against @entity79 and its leadership , " @entity3 said			0
on @entity8 , the president provided a largely optimistic assessment of the @entity7 effort , saying violence there is currently " near the lowest it 's been in years			2

@entity8 officials also said 100 so - called " terrorists " were killed , and 955 others were detained			0
the @entity7 military has disputed the @entity8 figures , saying the actual numbers are less than half what @entity8 's government reported			1
the @entity7 command in @entity119 , @entity8 , " refutes that 535 people were killed in @entity8 during the month of july , " the military said in a statement sunday			1
it put the total number of people killed by " enemy action " at 222 , including 161 civilians , 55 @entity8 troops and six @entity7 -- the ninth - lowest civilian casualty count since january 2008 , according to the @entity7 military			1
the @entity7 military has said it believes @entity8 security forces can maintain current levels of relative stability , but that sentiment is not shared by many @entity8			1
former @entity8 prime minister @entity131 said in a recent interview with @entity2 that he is concerned that " the security is declining ... [ and ] that 's why we need really good resolutions , we need to expedite the formation of a government and we need to create an understanding in the region , and we need the help of the @entity7 to facilitate all of these issues through its good offices in @entity8 and elsewhere in the region			2
" starting in september , the number of @entity7 troops in @entity8 -- 50,000 -- will be almost a third of the total number there when @entity3 took office in january 2009 , the @entity145 has said			1
there will be 96,000 @entity7 troops on the ground in @entity62 -- more than three times the number there at the beginning of @entity3 's term			1
in july , there were 81,000 @entity7 troops in @entity8 and 87,000 in @entity62			1
while there is sharp public division over the @entity7 effort in @entity62 , @entity7 largely support the removal of @entity7 forces from @entity8			2
nearly two - thirds of all @entity7 back the administration 's plan to remove most troops by the end of august , according to a may 21 - 23 @entity2 / @entity170 poll			0
only 36 percent of @entity7 favor the war in @entity8 , the survey indicated			2
@entity3 offered praise monday for all the veterans of major @entity7 military conflicts since @entity176 " in the life of our nation , not every generation has been summoned to defend our country in its hour of need			1
but every generation to answer that call has done so with honor and courage , " he told the enthusiastic crowd			0
the president ran through a litany of administration initiatives for military veterans , including " dramatically increased funding for veterans health care across the board			0
" among the initiatives he highlighted : an increased use of electronic record - keeping that will allow veterans , for the first time , to go to the @entity202 's website and download or print personal health records " so you have them when you need them and can share them with your doctors outside the @entity202			0
