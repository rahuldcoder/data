-- @entity3 " @entity4 " host @entity1 suffered severe burns as the result of a propane grill accident at her @entity9 home on december 11			1
@entity0 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity10 spoke with her recently			2
here is an edited version of that interview			2
@entity0 : do you do feel lucky ? @entity1 : i feel very blessed			1
i was the best person off in that burn unit			2
what many or so many suffer from is so exponentially worse than i could ever imagine			2
i 'm so grateful to be able to do my job , to sit here and to talk to you and to be able to carry on			2
so the only reason that i will have wanted to share what i have wanted is because i do n't want it to happen to anybody else , and i also want people to you know understand a little bit about what burn victims go through			2
the pain is there for a long time ; the trauma is there for a long time			1
i think it 's not always obvious			1
@entity0 : when the doctor came in and finally told you all the burns and the types of things that had happened , do you remember how they described to you what had happened ? they said , " you have first - degree burns on your hand and your neck			1
" the neck , you could actually see the flame -- it was like a flame shape , going up the neck			2
@entity0 : what was the treatment at that time , initially ? storm : i had to have a silver patch			1
it was a huge silver patch , so i was all ... patched up from like here to here			2
but the body is ... incredible			2
you know , what it can do			2
i do n't think people realize how exhausting it is when -- it 's that pervasive feeling of exhaustion when you 're recovering from burns			1
it 's something that 's still really surprising to me , because i still feel that way			1
you 're just so incredibly tired , and then you 're just ... you are so sore and then even now ... my chest is hot and my hands ... you feel that heat , and you feel the pins - and - needles feeling , you know , and you feel sensitive			2
you almost still feel it			2
@entity0 : medical care here , how was it ? because again , these are significant injuries but if they 're treated well or early ... storm : every burn has its own personality			1
it goes in its own direction			0
this hand got swollen and got infected			0
infection is your no. 1 enemy with burns			1
... this then got a fungal infection			0
so this hand really went through the wringer and was pretty ... double the size and really , you know , monstrous looking			0
every burn on my body has had its own different personality			0
and all of them needed different things			0
so i got this cream ( that ) went here , and this hand needed this , and this hand needed that			0
my youngest daughter , @entity111 , because there were so many different lotions and types of bandages and wraps ... she actually took sticky notes and organized everything			0
just taking care of that and taking care of the wounds was pretty much all i could do			0
it was so time - consuming			1
@entity0 : is it hard for you to just be by that grill where this all happened , psychologically ? storm : i have n't really gone to the grill			1
it 's the first time i 've been out there			1
i wo n't cook on that grill			1
maybe that seems silly , and maybe that 's just today , but it was ... a terrible , traumatic , frightening event			1
and i do n't want to be -- i do n't like being afraid			0
i believe in tackling things you 're afraid of			0
but i think it will be a very long time before i grill on that type of grill again			1
you know , i was in a hurry			1
that 's when a lot of accidents happen			1
you 're hurried , you 're distracted , you 're rushing , and that 's a big personal lesson for me is , slow down			1
sportscasting pioneer returns to tv after serious burns @entity0 : i hope that a lot of people are listening , because i have to say , guilty , you know , i 've probably been in that same position before			1
storm : and also ... how many people are drinking beers and grilling , just talking , you know how many little kids are wandering about around the grill and you know , it 's like a lot of things			1
it can very safe , and it can be very useful , and it can be a healthy way to cook			0
all of those things ... can also be dangerous if you do n't do it properly and use it properly			0
@entity0 : let me ask you a couple of specific questions with regard to burns			1
sometimes , people can develop a pigmentation , some excessive and some not enough			0
is that something your doctor spoke about ? storm : yes			1
i ca n't go in the sun at all for six months			0
and there are some pretty significant pigmentation dangers with permanent pigmentation issues to my face and to my neck			0
obviously , i 've got potentially really big issues on the horizon there with my chest and my hands			0
@entity0 : hot / cold sensitivity ? is that something that came up ? storm : yes			1
hot and cold and just the temperature			0
i know that when i 've gone to work , that even the lights in the studio ... all of a sudden , that can bring on like a really serious heat flash , like change your body temperature , and at times you also get really , really cold ... inability to regulate your own body temperature			0
@entity0 : obviously , the concern when you 're working and you 're at outside events , has that happened to you ? storm : well , you know , the @entity209 is outside , so i 'm going to have to be really , really , really careful			1
i 'm going to be in direct sunlight , so i 'm worried about that			0
in the studio , we read our copy off a teleprompter , and i have had vision change since the accident so the corneas are singed			2
... i had all my prescriptions changed			0
they have to move the cameras closer and change the type that we read in the teleprompter			0
@entity0 : but you 're able to -- you 're making it work			0
do you think you 're over the worst of it now ? storm : physically , i think that the discomfort and the fatigue is still there			2
... this is my big thing for the day , talking to you , you know			0
whereas normally this would have been a part of an extraordinarily busy day			0
and so , you know , being a mom , being an anchor , having a production company , running a foundation ... i 'm one of those go , go , go , go ... people , and i 'm just going to put one " go			0
" ... just go and proceed with caution and attention to what you 're doing instead of the crazy rush			1
