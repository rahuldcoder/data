-- with his @entity3 proposal , @entity1 is n't the only entrepreneur proposing ways to rev up @entity7 transportation			1
the man who brought us sleek , clean electric @entity11 cars and @entity12 -- a private space program that successfully sent a payload to the orbiting space station -- is setting his sights on a radically different mass transit proposal called @entity3			1
giant vacuum tubes would suck travelers across hundreds of miles in a matter of minutes			1
related : @entity1 wants to revolutionize transportation again technology in the @entity24 is spurring creative ideas aimed at improving -- and even reinventing -- the way humans travel			1
the issue is becoming a pressing one with increasing traffic and vehicle emissions			0
@entity1 's idea is one of countless transportation concepts being bandied about -- some of which may blow your hair back , others that may amount to pie in the sky			1
some may be closer to reality than you think -- like driverless cars and space tourism			1
for other ideas , the future is murky			1
the media loves a good gee - whiz story			0
remember the @entity48 ? when that was announced in 2001 , we read that these two - wheeled transportation machines would change the way we commute and how cities would be designed			1
how many segway owners do you know ? or how about the @entity56 , a pedal - powered transportation system that so impressed the folks at @entity59 , the company gave its inventors $ 1 million for research and development			1
in the three years since @entity56 won the award , it has n't made a lot of news			0
the lesson is , it 's a long way between the drawing board and reality			1
related : more transportation coverage let 's take a look at some of the ideas floating out there that may influence the way we travel from @entity78 in the future			1
planes by 2019 , a small aircraft - maker reportedly plans to start offering a $ 5 million two - seater jet aimed at business execs who want to fly as fast as 720 mph -- close to the speed of sound			1
but , mostly , the buzz around the future of flight surrounds something even faster : supersonic combustion ramjets -- aka scramjets			2
imagine flying from @entity91 to @entity92 in under two hours			0
scramjet technology could make that dream a reality			2
experts predict scramjet engines could propel aircraft as fast as 15 times the speed of sound , according to @entity100			0
unlike conventional jet engines , scramjet engines have virtually no moving parts			0
and unlike rockets , scramjet engines would burn oxygen from the atmosphere instead of having to carry heavy tanks full of oxygen			0
the result : a more efficient vehicle for military or commercial purposes			0
last year the @entity113 tested a 25 - foot long scramjet called an @entity115			0
such technology could be used to develop " cruise missile - like weapons that could reach a target on the other side of the planet in minutes instead of hours , " one expert told @entity0			1
another application for the technology , he said , is an " aircraft which could put a quick - reaction force on a far - off battleground within hours instead of days			2
" a @entity129 - based outfit called @entity130 has been working on scramjet technology			2
it produced a video to show its vision for a passenger aircraft called the @entity136 , which would fly five times the speed of sound			0
this month @entity130 announced a partnership with the @entity139 to figure out its next system to launch vehicles into orbit			0
related : how we 'll travel in 2022 trains early in the @entity147 administration , federal transportation officials began pushing the idea of high - speed rail , by offering taxpayer dollars to interested states			1
one of those states is @entity152			0
on its website , @entity152 's high - speed rail project still officially promises service from @entity156 to the @entity158 area in under three hours at more than 200 mph			1
but the program 's initial projected cost of $ 34 billion has ballooned to $ 118 billion			2
officials are considering a slower , less ambitious train system , @entity0 special investigations correspondent @entity161 reports			0
related : is @entity152 high speed rail for real ? related : would you board a moving train ? in the @entity168 , @entity167 operates @entity169 -- a rail service capable of speeds up to 150 mph that shoot riders from @entity91 to @entity173 in about 96 minutes			2
responding to critics who say @entity169 is too slow and too infrequently reaches its top speed , @entity167 plans to run test trains at 165 mph in @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181			2
high - speed rail critics often oppose it because they say it costs taxpayers too much			0
which is why a proposal in @entity188 is so interesting			0
the @entity189 has a plan to build a high - speed train without any taxpayer dollars			0
spanning the nearly 240 miles separating @entity193 and @entity194 , a @entity196 - style " bullet train " reportedly would haul 500 passengers in just 90 minutes			1
maximum speed : around 220 mph			0
if all goes as planned , the train would be running by 2020 , according to organizers			0
related : vehicles that changed the world automobiles drivers ? who needs ' em ? we 've got computers ! driverless cars have been legal in @entity152 for nearly a year			1
carmakers @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 are planning to offer automated vehicles by the end of this year , the @entity210 reported			0
as more computers take the driver 's seat , it remains to be seen how driverless cars will safely interact with cars piloted by humans			1
other car - related transportation ideas are winding their way through the national conversation			1
how about solar - powered smart - roads ? inventor @entity229 has proposed building a national network of wired highways made of very strong glass			0
solar electricity generated by the highways would recharge electric vehicles that use the road			0
the highway 's streetlights and led warning signs also would be powered by the road			2
space @entity242 's on board			2
who else wants to fly to the edge of space ? @entity242 has signed on to be among @entity248 's first passengers			2
the company -- founded by billionaire @entity250 -- says it 's on track for its passenger spacecraft to reach space in a test flight for the first time by the end of this year			2
more than 500 would - be space tourists have signed up to take short $ 200,000 flights that would involve several minutes of weightlessness			2
@entity260 says it 's ready for space travel			1
the state has built a kind of airport for space ships called @entity266			0
it 's open for business and @entity100 has already used the facility for unmanned rockets			2
other ideas aimed at going up include a proposal for an elevator that would take cargo and travelers into space			1
opinion : @entity3 could be a reality other ideas what about the extreme future of transportation ? believe it or not , scientists have been talking about an idea of getting from here to there that sounds like something from " @entity290			1
" could @entity293 's " transporter " ever become a real thing ? in 2007 , scientists indicated to @entity0 that someday it might be possible to scan a person using some advanced form of the technology used to perform mri scans , and transmit that scanned information somewhere else -- using normal electrical or sound signals -- where it would then be reassembled into an approximation of the original			1
but there will always be skeptics , like @entity308 , physics editor of @entity309			0
" i really do n't think it is ever going to happen , " she said			0
" then again , one thing i 've learned is never to underestimate the ingenuity of physicists , so never say never			0
" hyperloop vs. world 's fastest trains			1

entrepreneur @entity1 proposes @entity3 : shooting travelers through tubes
@entity1 's idea is aimed at allowing people to travel from @entity156 to @entity158 in 30 minutes
the technology era is spurring countless ideas to improve transportation
ideas include scramjets , bullet trains and driverless cars
