legislators in the capital of @entity4 's restive far - western @entity3 province passed a law wednesday to prohibit residents from wearing burqas in public , state media reported thursday , highlighting the government 's continued campaign against religious extremism			1
the new ban in @entity13 was first reported on ts.cn , a @entity3 government - run website , and later widely published by other state media outlets			1
the ordinance name suggests it targets outer garments covering someone 's full body including the face , which is called a burqa in some @entity25 traditions			2
a spate of recent violent incidents has rocked @entity3 , a resource - rich region long inhabited by the turkic - speaking , largely @entity30			1
the arrival of waves of @entity33 , the country 's predominant ethnic group , over the past decades has fueled ethnic tensions			1
@entity4 officials have blamed the recent attacks on @entity39 -- whom they also label " religious extremists " -- seeking to establish an independent state			0
the ts.cn story mentioned the @entity13 law was submitted to the provincial legislature for final approval before it could be implemented			0
in august , another city in @entity3 banned people wearing @entity25 - style clothing and large beards from riding public buses during a provincial sporting event , according to state media			1
