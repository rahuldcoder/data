@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has a message for @entity1 authorities who seized a cargo ship packed with sugar and weapons : release the boat and let the crew go			1
" the @entity1 investigation authorities rashly attacked and detained the captain and crewmen of the ship on the plea of ' drug investigation ' and searched its cargo but did not discover any drug , " a spokesman for @entity3 's @entity13 told state - run @entity14 on wednesday			1
" yet , they are justifying their violent action , taking issue with other kind of cargo aboard the ship			0
this cargo is nothing but aging weapons which are to send back to @entity32 after overhauling them according to a legitimate contract			0
" according to the state media report , the spokesman described the incident as an " abnormal case			0
" " the @entity1 authorities should take a step to let the apprehended crewmen and ship leave without delay , " the spokesman said , according to @entity14			2
but @entity1 showed no signs of stopping its investigation into what it said were undeclared military weapons hidden aboard the @entity3 ship			1
@entity1 has formally asked the @entity49 for guidance on how to handle the case , and expects @entity49 representatives to arrive soon in @entity1 to investigate , foreign minister @entity48 told @entity2 en @entity53			1
because it is pursuing nuclear weapons , @entity3 is banned by the @entity49 from importing and exporting most weapons			2
a spokesman confirmed that @entity1 had filed a report with the @entity49 's @entity3 sanctions committee			1
@entity49 @entity61 ban ki - moon " commends the action taken by @entity1 , " a spokesman said			1
in addition to reaching out to the @entity49 , @entity1 also has asked the @entity63 to help provide technical assistance			1
the details of the dramatic case sound like a deleted scene from the @entity68 : a violent confrontation on a detained ship , missiles hidden under sacks of brown sugar , an apparent heart attack and an attempted suicide			0
the weapons were discovered monday , and as of wednesday , authorities were still searching the vessel			0
the ship originated from @entity32 , and @entity32 officials admitted that the weapons on board were theirs			2
they described them as " 240 metric tons of obsolete defensive weapons " sent to @entity3 " to be repaired and returned to @entity32			2
" the equipment was manufactured in the mid- 20th century and included two anti-aircraft missile systems , nine missiles in parts and spares , two @entity92 - 21 jets and 15 motors for this type of airplane , the @entity32 foreign ministry said			1
the ship 's captain -- who allegedly suffered a heart attack and then tried to commit suicide as the cargo was being searched -- and the 35 @entity3 crew members have not been charged , but the attorney general 's office said they could face charges of threatening national security			1
the crew resisted arrest and engaged in a " violent " confrontation , @entity1 's security minister , @entity110 , said tuesday			2
@entity1 's public ministry ordered the crew 's detention , and authorities have since spoken with crew members about their travel plans			1
crew members said the @entity3 ship had left @entity32 and headed toward @entity1 , aiming to arrive back in @entity3 in 51 days			1
the @entity63 and @entity1 had been tracking the ship as it crossed the @entity121 to @entity32 and then back , two @entity63 officials said			1
and a @entity123 spokeswoman said wednesday that the @entity63 would help in the investigation			0
the @entity1 asked the @entity63 for imaging equipment and technicians to fully examine the boat and determine what is on board , according to a @entity63 official who declined to be identified because the person was not authorized to speak publicly			1
speculation has surged since @entity1 announced its find , with some warning that it was a troubling sign of weapons deals between @entity3 and @entity32 , and others disputing whether any dangers lay within the antiquated haul			1
@entity32 says the weapons are " obsolete			0
" and experts who identified early @entity68 relics such as the @entity145 - designed @entity144 air defense system among the ship 's cargo say that 's not far from the truth			2
" today there is no reason for any @entity157 pilot to be hit by an @entity144 -- if you get caught by one of them , you 've done something bloody stupid , or you 've got very bad luck , " said @entity150 , editor of @entity151 and @entity152			0
" no modern country wants to be seen with those			0
" but others saw the weapons haul as a more ominous sign			0
in a letter to @entity63 secretary of state @entity168 , sen. @entity169 of @entity170 , a frequent @entity32 government critic , described the weapons shipment as a " flagrant violation of multiple @entity173			1
" " i believe that this revelation , in addition to @entity32 's failure to address its abysmal human rights record , should finally prompt the ( @entity179 ) administration to re-calibrate its misguided and naive @entity32 policy , " @entity169 wrote			2
" the administration should immediately reverse its january 2011 decision easing restrictions on people - to - people travel and remittances sent to @entity32 ; as well as immediately halt granting visas to @entity32 government officials			0
" @entity189 columnist @entity188 told @entity2 's " @entity190 : @entity191 " that the boat 's cargo was a warning sign that @entity3 could be supplying @entity32 with weapons			2
" this is a country which is just 90 miles away from @entity63 shores , " he said			0
" now , if they can smuggle missile radar into @entity32 , you know , @entity199 knows what else they can put there			0
we do not need a replay of the @entity207 , this time with the @entity3 ' fingers on the triggers instead of the @entity145			0
" the @entity63 government 's assessment is that @entity32 might be trying to further its arms relationship with @entity3 in the wake of @entity215 's not being interested in doing the upgrade work on the aging stockpile , a @entity63 official said			1
