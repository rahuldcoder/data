@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 laced into his conservative @entity5 congressional critics tuesday , accusing them of putting partisan political concerns before the country 's interests			1
appearing before a crowd of farmers and small - business owners in the presidential battleground state of @entity1 , @entity3 called on @entity13 to help boost an anemic economy by passing an extension of the payroll tax cut and a new road construction bill , among other things			1
" @entity20 is going to come back from this recession stronger than before , " the president declared			0
but i " need your help sending a message to @entity13 " that " it 's time to put politics aside and get something done , " he said			2
elements in @entity13 refuse to " put country ahead of faction , " @entity3 said			1
it is time to " put country ahead of party and put the next generation ahead of the next election			2
that 's what i 'm fighting for			0
" @entity3 's latest salvo against tea party - backed republicans came in the midst of the president 's three - day @entity43 bus tour , ostensibly meant to promote administration 's new rural economic development initiatives			1
the president is scheduled to discussed a number of political and economic issues during a one - on - one interview with @entity2 's @entity51 on tuesday afternoon			1
among other things , the administration is pushing $ 350 million in additional @entity55 funding to rural small businesses over the next five years			2
the @entity57 is also working to promote greater venture capital investment in rural startups and using more than 2,800 @entity20 @entity61 offices nationwide to help publicize job opportunities			0
loans from the @entity64 are being made available to help recruit staff members to 1,300 rural hospitals			0
the initiatives are based on recommendations from the @entity69 , which @entity3 created in june to report on rural @entity20 's economic climate			1
@entity3 's trip to @entity0 , @entity1 , followed stops in both @entity73 and @entity1 on monday			1
on wednesday , the president will host a pair of town hall forums in his home state of @entity78			0
the first family is then scheduled to depart for a vacation in @entity81 , @entity82 , on thursday			0
@entity3 's remarks on tuesday echoed comments he made monday , in which he slammed partisan politics and called on lawmakers to prioritize economic growth			1
" the problem we have is not with our country			0
the problem is that our politics is broken , " he said at a town hall meeting in @entity92 , @entity1			2
" there are a whole host of ideas that we could be implementing right now that traditionally have had bipartisan support			0
the only thing that is preventing us from passing them is that there are some folks in @entity13 who think that doing something in cooperation with me , or this @entity57 , that that somehow is bad politics			0
" the president said he will release a detailed plan to boost the economy , create jobs and control the country 's deficit when @entity13 returns to @entity116 in september			0
he began his tour with a town hall meeting before a supportive crowd at a riverside @entity73 park in @entity122			0
@entity124 chairman @entity123 on monday blasted the @entity43 swing as nothing more than a campaign event thinly disguised as an extended public policy discussion			1
" he 's spending taxpayers ' dollars on a bus tour disguised as some kind of economic event for the country when we all know that it 's a campaign event paid for by the taxpayers , " @entity123 said			1
earlier , the @entity124 issued a " briefing book " on the trip made to resemble one produced by the administration in which it mockingly described the trip as " a totally non-political taxpayer - funded administration event that just happens to criss - cross several battleground states critical to the president 's reelection			1
" @entity5 presidential hopeful @entity150 's campaign posted a message to his website that was similarly critical			2
" during his @entity156 bus tour this week , it is unlikely president @entity3 will speak with unemployed @entity20 , to near - bankrupt business owners or to families struggling to survive in this economy , " the statement reads			1
" he is more interested in campaigning in swing states than working to solve the economic crisis that is crushing the middle class			0
" administration officials defended the trip last week , saying it was not political in nature			2
it was meant as an opportunity for @entity3 to visit with residents in their own communities to talk about national economic policy , they said			1
" that is n't just an appropriate thing for a president to do , it 's something that a president should do , " @entity174 , @entity3 's principal deputy press secretary , said friday			2
at the @entity122 meeting , @entity3 hit on recent themes blaming economic problems in part on turmoil in the @entity190 , debt problems in @entity181 and the earthquake and tsunami in @entity184 , but he said the biggest problem was intransigence in @entity116 , particularly among @entity5 unwilling to accept any tax increases to help solve the nation 's budget problems			1
he also touched on education , health care reform and other topics			0
@entity2 's @entity199 contributed to this report			0
watch @entity201 with @entity51 weekdays at 4pm to 6pm et and saturdays at 6pm et. for the latest from @entity202 .			0
