it is difficult to know at what point things of horror become forgotten and slip out of the world 's view			2
perhaps it is when they are eclipsed by another , seemingly more pressing crisis			2
or when it becomes almost impossible -- for safety or other reasons -- for outside observers to bear witness to their daily toll			0
@entity16 has , somehow , sometime between late 2012 when it was the open sore of the @entity19 civil war , and today -- when the fight against @entity21 has completely grabbed the world 's attention span -- slipped off the radar screen			1
but here is why it must not : there remain an estimated 300,000 civilians there , in rebel - held areas alone			1
these are people who suffer any one -- or all -- of the following litany of afflictions daily : barrel bombs -- randomly dropped , crudely made devices intended to maim , kill and terrify ; warring rebel militia , also fighting with the regime ; radical @entity42 groups ; shortages of food and water ; people cutting down whatever trees they can find for fuel			1
and above all a sense , for months now , of hopelessness that their world has only worsened since the fight for @entity16 began in june 2012			1
that their fight has been deemed by some to be so incurable and intractable that the outside world has left @entity16 to its own devices -- willing to help the winner , but not to assist a victory			1
@entity16 is the greatest prize in the fight for @entity19 's north , but also its greatest victim			1
@entity16 , the biggest city , its commercial hub , its cultural heart , is a skeleton of what stood proudly merely three years ago			1
it is very difficult to gain independent access to @entity16			1
you can count on one hand the number of western tv channels who have done so in the past year			0
@entity1 last entered in june , for six hours			0
kidnapping is now the major hazard			0
after months of hospitality and risking themselves to assist journalists , rebels now find their ranks bedevilled by radicals and criminals who see foreign media often as a form of currency to help with boosting funds or dealing with another scourge : @entity21			0
there are a few exceptions who , through luck of contacts , manage to evade the various hazards			0
@entity96 photojournalist @entity95 managed to spend a month in @entity16 with some of the more moderate rebel groups			1
they provided him access to their world			0
access to a school hidden away in a house where children still learn @entity106			0
to an artist who commemorates the war 's dead with paintings he etches out in a cave underground , that also serves as a bomb shelter			0
and to the front lines where the battle for @entity19 's largest city is being fought with a desperation not seen before			2
@entity95 gained access to one key battle currently under way			2
and as in so much of @entity19 's war , it has been that way for months and will probably go on so , as the outcome is so vital that nobody is prepared to give up : the fight for a small hill called @entity125			1
the hill and its associated settlement lies to the northeast of @entity16 city , on a vital road into the rebel - held areas			1
the regime has a strong presence to its west and has been pushing up to the east for the past weeks			0
@entity138 , hourly , they push towards this raised bit of geography , which , if it were to fall into their control , would allow them to shell the only roads in and out of rebel - held areas , effectively denying the rebels , and the civilians who live among them , their use			1
then , many fear , the siege of @entity16 would begin			2
the regime has tried this tactic -- dubbed " @entity155 " -- before , namely in @entity156			0
they besiege an area , deny its fighters and civilians food , medicine , everything			1
eventually , the regime presents a deal : leave or surrender			0
the fear is that the fall of @entity168 might present a similar opportunity for the regime			0
and then the humanitarian catastrophe currently brewing inside rebel areas would mushroom			2
@entity173 , a spokesperson for @entity174 , says the situation this winter in @entity16 " is very desperate , regardless whether areas are control of the government control or armed opposition groups			1
" waterborne diseases continue to spread , partly because often as many as 50 to 70 displaced people share the same toilet			0
" there is no electricity or fuel for heating which leaves many people with the only choice of cutting trees from the public spaces and use them to heat the houses " she says , adding the situation is even harder for the displaced as many live in " unfinished buildings or collective shelters where they have no windows , doors or even walls			2
" @entity174 estimates that 65,000 families risk being cut off from any assistance should the regime take @entity204 hill -- that 's about 300,000 people			1
another 100,000 children simply need warm clothes for this winter , @entity173 adds			0
that is around @entity16 alone			2
this is the nightmare of being caught between a regime trying to besiege them on one side , and on the other , the evil of @entity21 trying to impose their radical worldview .			0

an estimated 300,000 civilians are stuck in rebel - held areas around @entity16
they are at risk of barrel bombs and warring militias and are short of food , water and fuel
