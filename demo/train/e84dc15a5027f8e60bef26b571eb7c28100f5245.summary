@entity0 -- the @entity2 has been torn apart for most of its bloody history			1
its people have known little other than death , war and greed			2
the @entity11 state has been plagued by fighting over the control of its phenomenal natural resources -- a wealth of diamonds , gold and copper that sparked a war responsible for the deaths of over five million people			1
but now its citizens have the chance to experience rare unity as the country 's top football team seeks to complete an incredible journey			2
@entity11 champions @entity29 will take on the might of @entity32 's finest , @entity31 , in the final of the @entity34 in @entity35 on saturday night			1
@entity29 shock @entity36 to reach final the club hails from @entity39 in the south - eastern region of @entity41 , which has a history of separatism and experienced some of the worst fighting in the complicated , five - year war between 1998 and 2003			1
the conflict pitted different @entity2 ethnic groups -- funded and armed by many of the country 's neighbors -- against each other			2
as many as 20,000 @entity54 troops remain to keep the peace -- the world 's biggest peace keeping mission -- but unrest , including murders and mass rapes , continue in the north and east of the country			0
just last august , the @entity54 was criticized by human rights groups when at least 240 women , children and babies were raped within a few miles of their base in @entity68			0
yet @entity41 has enjoyed relative peace in recent years , in large part thanks to the province 's popular governor @entity71 , a billionaire @entity73 character who has regulated the region 's previously chaotic natural mineral extraction and bankrolled @entity29 in the process			1
@entity31 ease into @entity78 final " soccer is something very good for the kids to do ... to stay out of doing bad things , " @entity71 told @entity1			1
" they can help the country , the national team , and help also their families , because today you can see the money that is going into soccer is crazy			0
" @entity71 's money has transformed @entity29 from a failing club with an illustrious past -- they won back to back @entity11 titles in 1968 and 1969 -- into the best team on the continent			1
rather than spending big on flashy foreign imports , he has instead invested in @entity2 players , paying @entity32 - level wages to keep them at the club and out of the hands of @entity32 scouts used to picking off @entity103 's best talent for a pittance			1
the players ' salaries are rumored to be as high as $ 3,000 a week in a country where the average yearly wage is , according to christian aid group @entity109 , just $ 120			0
africans win opening match in @entity35 " [ @entity29 ] give 80 % of our players to the national team of @entity2 , " @entity71 explained			1
" we have over 2,000 boys at our academy , training to be the next @entity117 , to be the next @entity118			0
i like doing social programs for the people , that 's why i 'm in soccer			2
i do n't like anyone to suffer			0
" in @entity11 terms , the money dwarfs every other team on the continent			2
" just to give you an idea of how uneven the playing field is , i met @entity71 in @entity138 when i watched @entity29 play the @entity140 champions , " said @entity129 , foreign editor of @entity131 magazine and author of the book @entity134 : how @entity141			1
" their entire budget for the year was $ 200,000			0
but i asked @entity71 , and he said : " if we win , the players and staff share $ 250,000			2
" @entity29 's bonus pool for one match was bigger than the budget for the @entity140 champions for a whole season			1
" money is no problem and this helps attract great players but , crucially , it helps them keep the players from @entity32 clubs because he can pay good wages , " @entity129 said			2
from fishing boats to the @entity34 the huge budget helped @entity29 win the @entity164 title in 2009 for the first time in more than 40 years , and with it qualification for the @entity34 , a competition that pits the champions from the ruling body 's six confederations against each other			1
for the players , it was a hugely significant moment , one that they felt could have a transformative effect on their war - torn country			0
" there was many times my life was at risk ... but with the end of the war i am happy that there is now peace , " @entity29 's captain @entity180 told @entity1 last year before his debut in the competition			1
" football is a huge factor for development in @entity103 , in @entity2 especially			0
people love football so much , it unifies even in times of war			0
" but @entity29 's second appearance at the @entity34 was almost over before it started			1
@entity29 crowned kings of @entity103 at a goodwill tournament in @entity200 earlier this year , @entity198 -- considered to be the best footballer still playing on the continent -- was banned by @entity34 for a year after karate - kicking a referee			1
the match , and the tournament , was subsequently cancelled and the team expelled from the country			0
missing their star player , @entity29 struggled in the early rounds of the @entity164 , but battled through before hammering @entity212 side @entity211 5 - 0 in the final			2
yet without @entity180 , the team has made it to the @entity34 final , beating @entity218 's @entity217 and @entity219 's @entity36 along the way , without conceding a goal			1
@entity29 's success has seen @entity71 's popularity soar across @entity2 , so much so that the businessman is seen by many as a presidential candidate once @entity54 forces leave and elections are held at the end of 2011			1
@entity29 win 2009 @entity164 " he is a politician and [ funding @entity29 ] helps his political profile , " @entity129 said			0
" not just in @entity41 , where 90 % voted for him			0
he wants to send a message to the rest of @entity2 and wants to be seen as the rich philanthropic leader who builds roads and hospitals			0
" he used to be very good friends with [ president @entity242 ] @entity241 , but have had a bit of a falling - out			0
i do n't think he will stand against him , but he will stand [ in the future ]			0
@entity2 politics is very murky but i 'll be very surprised if he did n't run for the presidency			0
" for now , though , the club is concentrating on how to beat @entity253 winners @entity31 in saturday 's final in @entity35			1
for once , the entire country will be united behind one flag			0
" in @entity29 you find players who come from all the different provinces , " @entity71 said			2
" they have become something that belongs to the country			0

@entity2 club @entity29 becomes first @entity11 team to reach @entity34 final
@entity71 , governor of @entity41 , has bankrolled the club 's success
@entity2 's bloody war only ended in 2003 , which saw *5.3* million people killed
the team take on @entity32 champions @entity31 in @entity35 on saturday night
