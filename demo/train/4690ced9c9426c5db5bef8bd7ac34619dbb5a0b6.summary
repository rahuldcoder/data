when i rode the no. 7 train to @entity2 last sunday , i was one of the few women in a train car packed with @entity5			2
my knees were in full view , but i shielded my face behind a pair of shades and a copy of @entity13 ' atheist bible , " @entity14 , " held conspicuously aloft			2
toward the end of our shared journey , when it had become clear that the only people left on the train were headed to the same event , i looked up from my book , removed the sunglasses and asked the men sitting across from me if they were there to protest the @entity26 or the abuse			1
taken aback , they looked at me for a moment before answering " both			2
" they did not recognize me as @entity32 , the author of the controversial memoir about the life i fled as a @entity5 woman			1
some 60,000 @entity37 men had gathered to discuss the dangers that prurient elements of the internet present to their community			1
they were probably unaware of the planned counterdemonstration , which was being organized by a good friend of mine named @entity45			2
he 's a fellow @entity47 , who , like me , felt compelled to protest the rampant injustice and abuse covered up within the @entity5 and @entity37 worlds , some of which we had seen or experienced firsthand			1
after exiting the train and lingering in the parking lot for a moment , persona non grata because of my female status , i was approached by an erudite - looking @entity47 , who asked what i was doing there			0
he claimed that i could n't possibly understand what the rally was about , that the event was for men only			1
reporters inched closer , extending mikes and cameras			0
people seemed to think something juicy was going to happen			0
i opened my mouth to talk , and suddenly i felt a surge of adrenaline , the kind that makes your knees all shaky , fuel my words			0
it was my first time standing face to face with a man who represented my former oppressor			0
what i said boiled down to this : i am horrified that religious @entity83 would spend millions of dollars on a rally to protest an unstoppable force such as the internet instead of focusing their attention on the real problems their community is facing , such as the sexual abuse scandals that are now public knowledge			1
the internet can never be stopped , but parents and kids can be educated as to how to use it , just like in the real world			0
instead , i argued , the @entity37 were just trying to bury their heads in the sand and ignore the real problems by waving a giant distraction in front of it			0
i spoke with emotion because five minutes later i would join a group of people across the street , some of whom were formerly hasidic or @entity110 , and others who were still part of the community , but had summoned the courage to speak for the voiceless , all of whom had suffered or witnessed some form of abuse at the hands of the religious leadership			1
we held signs that said , " the internet is not the problem , " or " the internet did n't molest me , " because we felt outraged that real problems were being ignored while the community spent millions on a gathering designed to deal with the " evil " of the @entity26			1
the fact is that some @entity5 and @entity110 @entity83 continue to ostracize victims of abuse and support their abusers , and they offer no apology for doing so			1
they continue to deprive young men and women of vital education necessary for a successful and happy future			1
and both insiders , who are afraid to speak out , and people who 've left , feel that this is the case			0
it is no longer possible to pretend we do n't exist			0
to those who remained across the street , both physically and metaphorically , we called , " you 're on the wrong side ! " ours was the very power that the @entity110 rally was protesting , the power that the @entity26 gives to the lowly people and takes away from the rabbinic leadership			1
however , there is a new threat that the @entity5 community has to be concerned about , and this one is greater than the @entity26			1
the @entity5 community is endangered by their own members , for those who have been betrayed and abused are now brave enough to speak ; they will no longer be bullied into silence			1
the discussion has begun , and it has begun publicly , in the media			0
clearly , @entity5 communities feel threatened , as evidenced by the recent post in @entity163 titled " what women 's media needs to know about @entity166			1
" this essay was ostensibly written by a @entity5 woman in response to the media attention focused on the @entity2 spectacle			1
it has sparked a controversy both in the comments section and on forums such as @entity176 , a backlash that i felt compelled to join ( and blog about )			0
the article enraged many of my peers , some of whom are religious , because it replaces what could have been a sensitive personal essay about @entity186 with a whitewashed version of @entity5 life			0
@entity189 , the author of this article , assures us that she is a media professional with a degree in women 's studies from a liberal college			1
sadly , @entity189 omitted the most crucial details about her identity , namely that she is a member of the most liberal @entity5 sect ( @entity199 ) and that she is a @entity200 , which translates as someone who returned to the faith			0
so a woman who resided on the most liberal end of the spectrum in the most tolerant of all @entity5 sects , who had chosen this way of life after she had already had access to a secular education , wrote an essay on behalf of all @entity5 women across the global spectrum , telling women 's media that all is glorious and wonderful in their world			2
she made sweeping claims on behalf of @entity5 women : they all love their husbands , enjoy following the laws of marital purity and are safer from cervical cancer as a result			2
she also reduced all @entity227 women to a coke - snorting and skinny jeans - wearing caricature			0
words can not adequately describe the depth of my disappointment regarding this woman 's attempt at public relations			2
she said she felt compelled to write this in the wake of negative media attention , but she could have opted for a thoughtful essay on how she had come to choose her spiritual path and why it made her feel so fulfilled			0
she could have shared her personal journey without diminishing the pain and suffering of women who had n't been consulted before she put pen to paper			0
if @entity5 women can summon the moral fortitude to face up to the cracks in the foundation of the lifestyle , they can perhaps work toward repairing it , and create a healthier , happier environment for their children to grow up in .			2

some 60,000 @entity110 men gathered in *stadium* to discuss @entity26 's moral dangers
@entity32 has written a book detailing her years in the @entity110 community
@entity32 claims the @entity110 community *largely* ignores abuse at the hands of its leadership
