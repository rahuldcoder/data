-- @entity1 is confident he can beat @entity2 again if he meets the world no. 2 in the semifinals of a grand slam for the fourth time in a row at @entity8			1
the third seed ended @entity2 's 43 - match winning run at the @entity11 two weeks ago , but failed to add to his record 16 major titles as he lost to top - ranked @entity14 in the final			1
@entity1 is again in the same half of the draw as the @entity18 as he seeks to equal @entity21 ' leading seven @entity20 crowns at the @entity23 grass - court event , where he opens his campaign against @entity26 debutant @entity25 next week			1
it will be the @entity29 star 's first match on grass since his shock quarterfinal defeat by @entity32 at @entity8 in 2010 , as he pulled out of last week 's warm - up tournament in @entity34 due to a groin problem suffered at @entity11			1
@entity36 faces @entity37 in @entity8 opener " the first time i hit here on monday , very easily , like right away after 10 minutes , it feels so natural for me to play on grass			1
i hope that feeling is going to pay off by going deep and then hopefully winning the tournament here , " @entity1 told the tournament 's website on saturday			1
" i 'm happy about my game , and i am happy it showed in @entity50			0
i played a wonderful match against @entity2 , and also all the other matches before that were good			1
obviously i come into this tournament very confident			0
" i feel good about myself , about my body			0
the last week was vital for me to recover from my groin injury			0
i feel like i 'm almost back at 100 % again , which is a really good sign for @entity8			1
" why @entity59 's @entity8 mission is unlikely to succeed @entity2 beat @entity1 on the way to winning the @entity61 in january , and also triumphed in the semifinals of the @entity63 before losing at the same stage to his rival at the season - ending @entity66 in @entity67			1
" i did n't necessarily need to prove my point in @entity50 for my mind or for my confidence			0
i know i can beat @entity2 on any surface , " @entity1 said			1
" i 've done that in the past			0
just because he 's on a great winning streak does n't mean he 's unbeatable			2
" that was my mindset going into the match in @entity50			0
i was able to play well in the key moments			0
here at @entity8 anyway , i 'm even more confident			2
i think i 'm a better player than in @entity50 , so i expect myself to do really well here , even better maybe			0
" @entity1 said the world 's top - four players had similar chances of winning the title at @entity8 , where no. 4 @entity59 is seeking to become the first @entity84 champion since @entity85 in 1936			1
" i think all four guys at the top right now feel very comfortable on grass			0
that 's maybe something that 's a bit different than maybe in the past , where maybe one of the top four guys would n't feel so comfortable on grass , " he said			0
" but this year it seems like all of us are , which is a good thing			0
@entity59 's game is very natural for this surface			2
i think @entity2 has always been great , but nothing extraordinary yet			2
but with the run he 's on , obviously there 's a lot of possibilities for him as well here			2

six - time champion @entity1 could face @entity2 in @entity8 semifinals
@entity1 ended world @entity108 's long unbeaten run at the @entity11 two weeks ago
@entity29 star had lost his previous two grand slam semis against the @entity18
the 16 - time major winner says he can beat @entity2 " on any surface "
