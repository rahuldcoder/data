good news for air travelers passing through @entity3 : the city 's international airport is n't quite as bad as it used to be			1
that 's the only slightly uplifting word from the guide to sleeping in @entity8 , a travel website that produces an annual survey to identify the world 's worst and best aviation terminals			1
after being crowned worst three years in a row , @entity3 's @entity13 has this year lost its place at the bottom of the heap to @entity19 's @entity18			1
it 's now climbed to the heady position of fourth worst			1
despite the website 's name , airports were n't just rated according to how easy it is to catch some shuteye			1
readers were asked to judge facilities in four categories : comfort , conveniences , cleanliness and customer service			1
is @entity34 's @entity18 really so bad ? @entity13 officials did n't reply to @entity0 's requests for a comment , but survey respondents were less than complimentary			2

the survey ranked @entity46 's busiest airport , @entity48 's @entity47 as second worst , followed by @entity50 's @entity49			1
@entity3 's climb to fourth follows what many respondents said was a " slight improvement " created by the recent opening of its @entity56			2
three @entity59 airports frequented by low - cost carriers were next in line			2
@entity62 and " not - in - @entity63 " @entity64 tied for sixth			0
@entity65 near @entity66 was listed as eighth worst			2
@entity69 's @entity68 , ranked 10th , was the only @entity71 entry to make top 10 list			0
airport with a spa there were no surprises when it came to naming the best airport , with @entity80 's @entity79 taking the title it 's held every year since the survey began 18 years ago			1
its success is credited to the spa , pool , gym , four - story slide and movie theaters that make the airport a destination in itself			0
offering almost as many cool perks as its @entity80 counterpart , @entity96 's @entity95 was named second best			1
@entity97 and @entity98 ( last year 's third and fourth best airports ) dropped out from the top five to ninth and seventh spots , respectively			1
