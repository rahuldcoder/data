@entity0 , @entity1 -- in between consoling those touched by saturday 's @entity1 shooting and warning the nation against politicizing the tragedy , president @entity3 delivered some good news in his address at a @entity0 memorial event on wednesday			1
rep. @entity11 of @entity1 has opened her eyes for the first time since being shot four days ago			1
" there is nothing i can say that will fill the sudden hole torn in your hearts , " @entity3 said			1
" but know this : the hopes of a nation are here tonight			2
" did you watch the speech ? share your thoughts in a short video the attack killed six and left @entity11 fighting for her life			1
@entity3 told a crowd of thousands that he visited @entity11 earlier on wednesday and that her husband told him that shortly after the president left her room , " @entity33 opened her eyes for the first time			1
" " @entity33 opened her eyes so i can tell you know she knows we are here , she knows that we love her and she knows that we are rooting for her through what will undoubtedly be a difficult journey , " @entity3 said			1
@entity3 and his wife , @entity42 , sat next to @entity11 ' husband , astronaut @entity43 , throughout the ceremony , and next to @entity45 , an intern in @entity11 ' office who tended to the congresswoman 's wounds after she was shot			1

@entity3 spoke about @entity11 and briefly eulogized each of those killed in the attack before moving on to warn @entity63 against assigning blame for the attacks to those other than the gunman			1
" at a time when our discourse has become so sharply polarized -- at a time when we are far too eager to lay the blame for all that ails the world at the feet of those who think differently than we do -- it 's important for us to pause for a moment and make sure that we are talking with each other in a way that heals , not a way that wounds , " @entity3 said			1
" @entity84 tells us that there is evil in the world , and that terrible things happen for reasons that defy human understanding , " he said			1
" ... bad things happen , and we must guard against simple explanations in the aftermath			2
" " what we ca n't do is use this tragedy as one more occasion to turn on one another , " he said later			0
@entity3 's speech was frequently punctuated by applause and cheers from the crowd , at times seeming to belie the somber reason for the memorial			1
but @entity3 sounded an uplifting tone , saying of the victims : " our hearts are broken by their sudden passing			1
our hearts are broken -- and yet , our hearts also have reason for fullness			0
" beyond @entity45 , the president praised those who tackled the gunman as he stopped to reload and the medical staff who treated the wounded			0
" these men and women remind us that heroism is found not only on the fields of battle , " @entity3 said			1
" they remind us that heroism does not require special training or physical strength			0
heroism is here , all around us , in the hearts of so many of our fellow citizens , just waiting to be summoned -- as it was on saturday morning			0
" " it was pretty much what the nation needed to hear at this time , " said @entity128 , a retired architect who attended the speech			2
" @entity0 is a great place with a lot of great people , " @entity128 said , adding that @entity3 's speech " put @entity0 back in a positive light			1
it is a community and it is a place where we all get along and , together , care for each other			0
" other public officials took the stage before @entity3 , with many invoking scripture			1
" we will remember how to smile again , " @entity1 gov. @entity144 said			0
" we will go forward together			0
" secretary of homeland security and former @entity1 gov. @entity146 , @entity144 's predecessor as governor , read from the book of @entity149 , while attorney general @entity150 reads from the @entity151 of @entity152 to the @entity153			0

" you could see she was focusing and @entity43 said , ' @entity33 if you can see me , give me the thumbs up ' and not only did she give the thumbs up she raised her entire hand , " @entity166 said , referring to @entity11 ' husband			1
