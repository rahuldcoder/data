@entity0 -- the @entity2 and attorneys general from six states and the @entity0 filed a lawsuit tuesday challenging the $ 11 billion merger of @entity7 and @entity8 , saying the combination would lead to higher prices and less service for consumers			1
the merger , which would create the world 's largest airline , would " substantially lessen competition " for commercial air travel , contends the complaint , filed in @entity19 in @entity0			1
the carriers said in a joint statement that they would mount a " vigorous and strong defense " of their deal and pursue all legal options to move it forward			0
" we believe that the @entity2 is wrong in its assessment of our merger			0
integrating the complementary networks of @entity29 and @entity8 to benefit passengers is the motivation for bringing these airlines together			1
blocking this procompetitive merger will deny customers access to a broader airline network that gives them more choices , " the companies said			2
opinion : why @entity29 - @entity8 deal is good @entity8 shares slid more than 9 percent on @entity41			1
@entity29 is operating under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection			2
a top concern is local markets , the @entity2 said			0
it cited the example of @entity46 , where the combined airline would control 69 % of takeoff and landing slots , and 63 % of the outbound nonstop routes			0
the @entity2 also said in its complaint that if the two airlines were allowed to merge , there would be higher fees for baggage and flight changes			0
the states that joined the antitrust lawsuit are : @entity59 , where @entity29 's parent company @entity60 is based ; @entity61 , home base for @entity8 ; @entity63 ; @entity64 ; @entity65 ; and @entity66			1
the lawsuit comes as somewhat of a surprise			0
in recent years the @entity2 has allowed other big airline mergers -- @entity70 gobbled up @entity71 , and @entity72 absorbed @entity73 -- in part because the airline industry was losing so much money and the mergers were seen as necessary for survival			1
but airlines are now making billions of dollars , not only from higher fares but also from $ 6 billion in fees they collected in 2012 alone , for baggage and seat selection and other things that used to be included in fares			0
minority businesses would fight any @entity29 @entity89 merger @entity29 and @entity8 had touted their combination as one that " joins two highly complementary networks with access to the best destinations around the globe -- offering you increased choices , improved efficiency and better options " under @entity29 's @entity100 alliance			1
the @entity2 lawsuit cites internal documents from the airlines to show that the merger is n't needed and in fact would lead to cuts in programs that benefit travelers			0
an example is @entity8 ' @entity110 , which executives said would likely be eliminated after the merger , according to the @entity2			2
without the merger , antitrust officials said , other airlines would be forced to continue to match @entity8 ' discounts to compete			2
@entity29 has been in bankruptcy protection since 2011 and has been working to get approval from antitrust authorities and shareholders for the merger so it can emerge from court protection			1
the companies had hoped to complete the deal by the end of september			0
the @entity126 this month cleared the merger with the condition that the airline give up slots to allow new competition in the @entity133 - to - @entity134 route			1
@entity136 's @entity135 contributed to this report .			0

the merged @entity7 - @entity8 would be the world 's largest airline
