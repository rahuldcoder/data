@entity0 -- four key @entity4 senators who have announced their support for a " do n't ask , do n't tell " repeal are prepared to join @entity7 in voting to let the bill proceed , aides to the four said friday			2
the aides said @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 will vote saturday to end debate on the ban on openly gay and lesbian people in the military , regardless of whether the @entity17 passes a stopgap spending bill , a continuing resolution to keep the government funded			1
the four have previously said that bill must be approved first			0
the @entity17 is currently working to craft a temporary spending bill , made necessary after @entity7 leadership pulled a $ 1 trillion spending bill after @entity4 abandoned their support of it			1
the four senators ' support for the " do n't ask , do n't tell " repeal would ensure the 60 votes needed to clear the way for the bill to advance even if @entity33 , a @entity35 @entity34 , votes against it , as is expected			2
sen. @entity36 , who co-sponsored legislation that would repeal the policy , said friday that the four senators have " shown courage " in supporting the measure			0
@entity36 said he believes that the @entity17 will have more than the 60 votes needed , adding that the bill 's co-sponsors had worked closely with the @entity44 in crafting its language			2
but @entity44 officials are warning gay and lesbian soldiers that the current law will temporarily remain in place , if the bill passes , as they review the legal technicalities of the repeal			1
a guidance memo would be sent to military personnel informing them of the change , which would remain in effect for at least 60 days after it is signed into law , @entity44 spokesman col. @entity54 said			1
conservative republicans have argued that , among other things , a repeal would place an unreasonable burden on the military at a time when it is facing severe strains in @entity68 and elsewhere			0
the @entity69 voted wednesday to overturn the ban in a " standalone " measure not tied to any other legislative items			1
it passed 250 - 175 on mostly partisan lines			0
the @entity69 had passed a repeal of the ban as part of a larger defense policy bill , but the measure stalled last week in the @entity17			1
@entity79 and @entity7 leaders are trying to push through a repeal before the end of the current lame - duck congressional session			0
the more conservative incoming @entity84 , which will be seated the first week of january , is considered far less likely to overturn the @entity86 - era ban			0
@entity1 's @entity87 contributed to this report .			0
