-- this saturday , @entity2 's unbeaten colt @entity3 will be aiming to add the @entity4 to his @entity6 victory from earlier this month			1
it 's a neat double , achieved by only 15 horses before him			0
but his trainer has his eye on another prize			0
@entity3 has already captured the @entity14 2,000 guineas and the @entity6			1
assuming everything goes to plan this weekend , his next target will be the @entity18 at @entity19 in september -- and racing immortality			1
for @entity3 stands on the brink of that rarest of achievements , the @entity14 " @entity23 " of thoroughbred racing			1
royal regulations for @entity27 's fashionistas only 15 horses have ever done the treble in the century and a half in which the @entity30 , @entity6 and @entity18 have been run			2
three of those , wartime winners @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 will forever have an asterisk next to their names as racing was considered too disrupted in that period for their achievements to stand , making the " official " figure as low as 12			0
the last @entity23 winner was the great @entity44 , way back in 1970 ( although the brilliant filly @entity46 did win the " @entity47 " -- the @entity48 , the @entity49 and the @entity18 -- in 1985 )			1
few horses these days even attempt the full set			0
since @entity44 ( who , incidentally , also won the @entity4 en route to his treble ) , only two other horses have won both the @entity30 and the @entity6 , and both of those -- @entity56 ( 1989 ) and @entity55 ( 2009 ) -- opted for a tilt at the @entity58 instead of the @entity18			1
for many years it was considered so unlikely that a horse would ever win the @entity23 again that the soubriquet itself fell into disuse			1
it is now more commonly associated with @entity65 racing , so it is perhaps fitting that -- in the year that the @entity65 came so close to ending its 34 - year @entity23 drought with i 'll have another only for the colt to be scratched before the starter 's bell had even sounded for the @entity74 -- @entity14 could yet be celebrating a @entity23 of its own			1
first , of course , @entity3 must get through the @entity4 unscathed			1
he spearheads a three - strong @entity2 challenge that also includes astrology and @entity80			0
he will be ridden , as in all his starts to date , by his trainer 's son @entity82			0
at six foot , @entity82 cuts a distinctive figure in the paddock			0
just 19 years old , the precociously talented rider has already won more classic races than most jockeys will in their entire careers			0
he rode his first winner for his father at 16 and bagged his first classic a year later on @entity93 in the @entity94			0
last year he became the youngest jockey to ride a winner in the @entity97 on @entity98			0
but the lanky teenager is surely riding on borrowed time as far as his flat racing career is concerned , lending @entity3 's tilt at the treble even greater poignancy			2
the @entity107 ' @entity106 operation has already won this year 's @entity30 , @entity48 , @entity6 and @entity49 , making their domination of the @entity109 complete			2
last week they notched up another important win at @entity27 when @entity112 - bred so you think -- the horse with arguably the biggest carbon footprint in racing due to his worldwide travels -- captured the @entity118			2
but even in such distinguished company , the bay with the irregular white blaze stands out			0
reared in the same @entity123 paddock as his vanquished @entity6 rival @entity124 , @entity3 was sent to the sales as a yearling , where he was snapped up for 525,000 guineas ( $ 875,000 )			2
his earnings from his four races to date now exceed $ 1.5 million			0
@entity3 's impressive performances in the @entity30 and @entity6 this season have raised hopes that the son of @entity137 will have sufficient staying power to land the @entity18 , run over the longer distance of one mile and six furlongs			1
if successful , there will be more than a hint of a sense of destiny being fulfilled : the last horse to win the @entity23 , the legendary @entity44 , was trained by the great @entity145			1
although not related , @entity2 now trains out of the same @entity106 stables where @entity145 trained @entity44			2
the great colt 's life - sized statue now watches over the gallops where @entity3 does his daily workouts			1
the stage seems to be set for a fairytale ending			0
in @entity3 , @entity14 racing may have found its own @entity155 legend .			2

@entity3 is aiming to become only the 16th horse to win @entity4 and @entity158
the colt won the @entity14 2,000 guineas at @entity162 earlier this month
if @entity3 wins on saturday , the next target will be september 's @entity18
no horse has won the " @entity23 " since @entity44 in 1970
