oreo lovers have long debated how to eat them : twisted , dunked , creme first or bite whole			2
but most have never calculated just how stuffed oreos are , until now a high school math teacher in @entity5 tasked his students to find out just how much " stuf " is in each type of @entity9 -- original , @entity11 and @entity12			1
" most of them have had practice , as have i , in separating the @entity9 in half and getting a clean side , but getting two clean sides off just leaving the stuff was difficult , " said teacher @entity13			0
oreo : @entity11 here 's how they did it			0
the students weighed 10 of each type of sandwich cookie -- original , @entity11 and @entity12			2
they also weighed the wafers separately , without the creme subtract the weight of the wafer from the total weight of the cookie , and you get the stuff ! the results : shocking , if you can say such a thing about a cookie revelation			0
@entity13 's students discovered that those cookies we love so much , are n't all they 're stuffed up to be			2
double stuf ? not really			0
try 1.86 times the stuff of a regular @entity9			1
how about 2.68 times the stuff			2
" we were very surprised , " @entity13 said			0
and it apparently would be a surprise to the folks at @entity9 too			0
" while i 'm not familiar with what was done in the classroom setting , i can confirm for you that our recipe for the @entity54 cookie has double the stuff , or creme filling , when compared with our base , or original @entity9 , " said @entity9 spokeswoman @entity49			1
this is n't the first time a food favorite has come under fire for not measuring up			0
watch : @entity63 's footlong does n't add up last year a @entity63 customer 's photo went viral			1
it showed his foot - long sub only measured 11 inches			1
@entity63 said at the time that foot - long was " a descriptive name for the sub and not intended to be a measurement of length			1

an @entity54 is 1.86 times **bigger** , math students find
the @entity12 is 2.68 times **bigger**
@entity9 says @entity54 recipe has twice as much creme
other foods that do n't measure up : @entity63 's foot - long sandwich is 11 inches
