the @entity0 reported thursday that there were 325 confirmed or potential suicides last year among active and nonactive military personnel			1
" our highest on record , " said lt. gen. @entity4 , deputy chief of staff , manpower and personnel for the @entity0			1
the grim total exceeds the number of total @entity0 deaths ( 219 ) and total military deaths ( 313 ) in @entity12 in @entity13 , according to figures published by the military 's @entity15			1
for all of last year , 182 potential active - duty suicides were reported , 130 of which have been confirmed and 52 of which remain under investigation , it said			1
and 143 potential not - on - active - duty suicides were reported ( 96 @entity23 and 47 @entity24 ) , 117 of which have been confirmed and 26 remain under investigation			1
the total for 2011 was 283 -- 165 confirmed active - duty suicides and 118 confirmed not - on - active - duty suicides ( 82 @entity23 and 36 @entity24 )			1
no cases were under investigation			0
the toll comes despite what the military touts as extensive support and counseling programs			2
" the @entity0 continues to take aggressive measures head - on to meet the challenge of suicides as every loss of life impacts our family , " said @entity4			1
" in spite of the increased loss of life to suicide , with calendar year 2012 being our highest on record , the @entity0 is confident that through our continued emphasis in the services , programs , policies and training that support our @entity0 family , we will overcome this threat to our force			1
" how virtual reality can combat veterans ' ptsd for years , the @entity60 has struggled with how to identify service members at risk for suicide and to provide counseling and other services			0
the @entity0 and @entity65 have focused on teaching " resiliency " to troops in hopes of helping them cope with stress			1
military experts have long said one of the enduring challenges is that there does n't appear to be a direct link between suicides and the stress of being in the combat zone			1
" nobody knows no. 1 , why all the suicides			2
nobody has a good theoretical model for explaining this vector , but these are some possible contributors , " said dr. @entity82 , an expert in combat stress injuries			0
" the whole system being strained , more temper , stigma is rampant , leaders who should be getting more education for mental health issues but are not			0
" @entity82 said the stigma discourages soldiers from reporting issues related to stress in the combat zone			0
" to the extent that a military service branch that is having basically an epidemic of post-traumatic stress disorder is not embracing it as an epidemic , but instead sees it as ' they 're faking , ' " he said			2
" which has been part of the stigma problem			0
" treating ptsd with @entity107 the @entity0 's statement said it had expanded the @entity109 to strengthen relationships and family bonds ; certified more than 3,000 additional suicide prevention trainers in the @entity115 , @entity117 suicide intervention program ; revised the @entity114 program to include family members ; increased the volume and availability of behavioral health services ; and conducted an @entity0 - wide stand down during @entity122 to promote increased leaders ' awareness and involvement			1
the numbers did not surprise @entity127 , a member of the board of @entity129 , a nonprofit advocacy group			0
" as the service members return home and as the wars wind down , the mental trauma of war remains and there is an urgent need to make sure every service member receives a psychological evaluation upon returning home , and whenever a service member reaches out for help , the service member needs to receive it immediately , " he said			0
" in both of those areas , the military is trying to improve , yet it 's still falling short			2
for example , the military is now providing more psychological exams , but it 's not doing it for every soldier coming back			2
and the military still reports that it 's short - handed for mental health professionals and , because of the vacancies , that means either veterans do n't see a doctor at all , there 's delay seeing a doctor , the veteran is put in group therapy instead of individual or the veteran is given prescription drugs instead of receiving one - on - one counseling , which is the best standard			2
" the suicide hotline is 800 - 273 - 8255			0
a private - sector group , the @entity167 ( @entity167 ) , which provides military grief support programs , has reported it receives eight to 10 cases a week of people seeking help dealing with the suicide of a service member			0
of the people contacting the organization for care and support , 18 % were " grieving a death by suicide , " @entity167 has said			0
families face more challenges when military parents return			0
