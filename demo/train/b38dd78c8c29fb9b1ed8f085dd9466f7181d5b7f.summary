-- @entity2 golfer @entity1 took the first - round lead at the @entity4 after carding a spectacular six - under - par 64 on thursday , narrowly missing out on making history			1
the world no. 13 looked set to card the first 62 in a major championship after eight birdies in his first 17 holes but a bogey at the last meant he had to settle for the lowest opening round in an open championship at @entity13 and matching the overall course record			1
the 31 - year - old finished the day one shot ahead of @entity20 's 1999 @entity4 champion @entity19 , in - form 2007 @entity15 winner @entity15 -- who won on his last @entity16 start to earn a place in the field -- and @entity24 's @entity23			1
why @entity26 golf has a healthy future three time @entity4 champion @entity28 finished three shots behind @entity1 , tied for fifth , after a mixed opening round in his bid to win his first major since 2008			1
the 14 - time major winner was joined on three under by 2002 @entity4 champion @entity35 , former @entity38 winners @entity36 and @entity39 plus reigning @entity40 champion @entity40			1
@entity42 @entity4 leaderboard the buildup to the tournament was dominated by talk of the playing conditions , as @entity28 described the course as " almost unplayable " after his first practice round due to its thick rough			1
however , after several days of strong wind and heavy rain , benign conditions allowed the players to attack the @entity54 links course			2
" it was like a walk in the park today , and not like what we 've been experiencing in the practice rounds , " @entity1 told the official website			1
" i 'm sure there 's going to be some weather elements thrown at us the next three days so i 'm just going to have to knuckle down and handle that			2
" " but i 'm confident			2
my ball striking is good and i think i can get round no matter what the conditions are			2
" @entity28 was leading the field before @entity1 began his impressive run , as the @entity26 reached four under after seven holes -- but he missed several birdie putts and dropped a shot on the 15th			1
" it was a good start , " @entity28 said			1
" i hit the ball well all day but just lacked a bit of pace on the greens coming home			2
every putt was right on line , they were dying off the front of the lip			2
" i played practice rounds on sunday , monday , tuesday and they were completely different clubs based on the winds			0
" i was shaping the golf ball both ways			0
sometimes i rode the wind ; sometimes i held it against it			0
" @entity42 hope @entity36 also endured a mixed opening round			1
the @entity94 was going well on three under when he suffered a double bogey on 15			0
his tee shot struck a spectator and rolled out of bounds , forcing him to return to the tee			1
the former world number one picked up two birdies from the remaining three holes to pull himself level with tournament favorite woods			0
" it was an eventful last four holes			0
everything was going along pretty nicely , " the 2011 @entity38 winner said			0
" i hit it slightly right and got an unfortunate break			0
i thought i did well to keep my composure after that			0
" i did n't realize there was an out of bounds over there			0
it went 20 yards off his head			0
he could have headed it the other way ! " the most important thing was that he was okay and the birdie at 18 will make dinner taste very nice			0
" world number one @entity127 ended the day on level par after a subdued round			2
a birdie at the par - four third proved the highlight , while the @entity54 dropped a shot on the final hole to be tied for 33rd			1
defending champion @entity136 had a miserable opening round , finishing on six over par. @entity136 has been out of form since his victory and , bar a birdie at the 10th , the veteran @entity138 showed no sign of last year 's winning form			1
" i played poorly and i putted worse			0
it was very disappointing because at practice i hit really , really well , " @entity136 said			1
" basically , i 'm disgusted with myself			0
" world no. 3 @entity148 , still seeking his first major win , failed to live up to pre-tournament hopes as he ended on three over par. a double bogey on the third and five more dropped shots ended the @entity54 's chances of threatening the top of the leaderboard			2
the forecast is for a mostly clear day on friday , which should help the leaders continue their impressive start to the championship .			0
