-- in a field largely still in its infancy , scientists are making headway toward using stem cells to treat heart ailments			1
the @entity7 regulates which adult stem cell techniques are allowed to go into clinical trials			1
the major focus of stem cell research in cardiology is promoting regeneration of the heart or preventing scar formation , said @entity16 , who runs a stem cell biology lab at @entity18			1
one study reporting successful results in humans involves harvesting patients ' own stem cells , purifying them , and injecting them directly into the heart muscle			1
the stem cells have a surface marker called @entity27 , which means they are capable of growing new blood vessels			2
the study , sponsored by @entity31 , is the largest adult stem cell study for heart disease in the @entity34 , said dr. @entity35 , cardiologist at @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity38 , who is leading the trial			1
the researchers will present their one - year findings from @entity43 of the trial in september , @entity35 said			0
" it 's important to point out that this is a use of a patient 's own body 's repair capabilities , " @entity35 said			0
if everything goes well , it 's conceivable this treatment could be widely available in a little over four years , he said			0
the target patient population , consisting of end - stage cardiac patients who have tried all other available therapies , is about 300,000 to 900,000 people , he said			0
so far , researchers have not found side effects from this method , @entity35 said			0
however , because it is an invasive surgical procedure in which stem cells are delivered through a catheter , there is a risk of perforation of about 1 percent , he said			2
there is also a small risk of blood clotting from the drug , @entity71 , which mobilizes stem cells			2
injecting stem cells into the heart muscle carries the risk of arrhythmia , said @entity77 , associate professor of biochemistry at the @entity80 @entity79 at @entity81			1
but @entity35 said this risk is theoretical in his trial , and is believed to be very low with @entity27 cells in general			0
@entity77 and colleagues are working on a less - invasive technique			0
in a study in mice , they injected stem cells from bone marrow into skeletal muscles of limbs			2
they found that the stem cells produced growth factors that traveled to the heart , in addition to stimulating the muscle itself to make growth factors that also improved cardiac function			1
the challenge for translating this method to humans would be that , while each mouse needed only a few million stem cells , each human patient would need close to a billion stem cells for the therapy -- which would be far too expensive and logistically difficult			1
" this is a problem that 's been experienced by everyone in the field , " @entity77 said			0
he estimates that his method could be available clinically in five years , after researchers find ways to reduce the required number of cells by a factor of 10 or even 100			0
another therapeutic possibility is giving a patient an iv of stem cells , which would come from a stem cell bank or a company			1
the challenge is that the cells may not have the right homing receptors to land in the heart , @entity16 said			0
@entity16 's group is working on an approach to chemically modify the surface of cells to enhance their targeting to specific sites			0
results from animal models have shown promising results for targeting sites of inflammation , he said			0
" essentially we know the zip code of vessels within a certain tissue , we can program the address on the surface of the cell , " he said			0
@entity77 's and @entity16 's teams use adult mesenchymal stem cells , which may develop into connective tissue , lymphatic tissue , and blood vessels			2
these stem cells are largely interchangeable between patients and do n't require matching , as organ transplants do			1
however , as more becomes known about the relatively new field of stem cell therapy , a more specific matching system may be required , said dr. @entity160 , cardiologist at the @entity161			2
some stem cell therapies for the heart are being tested in human clinical trials			1
@entity165 is enrolling patients in a phase ii trial for @entity168 , which contains mesenchymal stem cells			2
the company intends to use this drug , which gets injected into the vein , to repair heart damage in patients who have just experienced their first heart attack			0
more than 90 percent of research on using stem cells to repair the human heart involves adult stem cells , @entity77 said			1
that means the controversy about using stem cells derived from human embryos is largely absent from this line of research			2
for developing treatments that involve transplanting stem cells from adults , there is no ethical concern about the use of embryos , @entity77 said			2
embryonic stem cells are advantageous in research because they can be grown more easily than adult stem cells in a culture , and are pluripotent , meaning they can develop into any of the various cell types of the body , according to the @entity198			1
but it is not yet known whether tissues derived from embryonic stem cells would cause transplant rejection , whereas this does not seem to be a problem with adult stem cells			1
the @entity7 regulates which adult stem cell techniques are allowed to go into clinical trials and sets the requirements for more routine use			1
whether the @entity7 will become more or less lenient in these respects is unclear , @entity77 said			0
it 's not unfathomable that within the next two to five years , some @entity7 - approved stem cell treatments will be available for cardiovascular disease , @entity77 said			1
@entity16 has a longer view -- five to 10 years before stem cell treatments become widely available for heart problems , he said			1
the biology of stem cell treatments for the heart is not well understood , said dr. @entity218 , chief of the @entity219 at @entity221 / @entity220			2
one of the challenges is that once a stem cell gets put into a person 's body , no one can get it out , @entity222 said			0
this is the opposite of other kinds of medications -- for instance , a person may get sick from taking too many aspirin , but eventually the drug leaves the system			0
not so with stem cells , he said			0
@entity222 expressed general caution about the future of stem cell research , which is still experimental , for heart patients			1
" this is a good idea , but patients and families should not expect immediate results , " he said .			0

most stem cell research targeted at the heart uses adult stem cells
the @entity7 regulates adult stem cell techniques that are allowed to go into clinical trials
*unlike* organ transplants , adult stem cells generally can be given to any patient
therapies be available in a little over four years , although some say five to 10
