-- as young children , the stress and burden of our life - threatening allergies to a range of common foods , including nuts , seafood , shellfish , eggs and other substances , really fell on our parents more than us			2
like many kids , we were unaware and felt invincible			2
we did n't worry too much about managing our allergies			2
that changed after the first severe allergic reaction either of us had			2
@entity18 was playing at a friend 's house when he ate what he had been assured was a " fake peanut			1
" almost immediately , it was apparent that something was very , very wrong			0
luckily , his friend 's dad also happened to be @entity18 's doctor ; he treated him immediately , and the incident was resolved			1
life - threatening allergies were much less common when we went to school , so we really stood out as the " strange twins with allergies " -- those guys who had to sit at a separate table by themselves at lunchtime			1
it is unfortunate that severe allergies are much more widespread now , but there is a silver lining : people and organizations are more aware and better able to support the children and adults who suffer			0
the idea to develop a new epinephrine auto - injector ( commonly known as an @entity48 ) , specifically designed for the needs of patients like us , came about the summer after we graduated high school			1
we were on our way to a family vacation in @entity55 , and it looked as if , once again , the two of us had not packed our epipens			0
they were too bulky so we often did n't carry them			0
after the usual finger - pointing and questions about why we did n't carry something that could save our lives , the idea of developing a smaller , more portable type of epinephrine auto - injector was born			1
at the time , we had recently selected our college majors			0
( @entity18 went into the engineering program at the @entity70 , and @entity71 chose pre-med / medicine at @entity74			1
) we decided to customize our education to develop the skills necessary to make this invention a reality			0
at the start of each school year we reviewed our course options and decided together which classes to take that would help us achieve our goal			1
our first real funding came from winning a collegiate inventors ' grant from the @entity87			1
it was at that point we knew we were on our way			0
soon after we confirmed what we had already suspected : that developing a new pharmaceutical product is extremely complicated			0
to do it successfully would require deep industry expertise			0
we founded @entity95 , which now has a leadership team with more than 100 years of combined experience in the pharmaceutical industry			0
we are fortunate to work with a team of industry veterans who are just as committed to patients as we are			2
as we say , the patients are the real experts -- we just need to create the opportunities to capture their insight and design products that truly address their needs			1
our entire approach puts the user at the center of development from the beginning of the process			0
it is hard to describe the feeling now that @entity114 -- the epinephrine auto - injector that is a culmination of the ideas we had all those years ago -- is available in pharmacies across the @entity117 ( and as @entity118 in @entity119 )			1
if you had asked us on the day of the launch in january , we would have told you that it simply ca n't get any better than this			2
about a month after @entity125 's launch , we read a @entity127 post in which a mother described how her daughter had a severe allergic reaction			0
she described how @entity114 helped her by " having a voice walking through the steps in an emergency situation			1
" in her opinion , @entity114 saved her daughter 's life			1
we can confidently say that there is no better feeling than that .			0

@entity18 and @entity141 developed @entity114 , which launched in january
their idea started the summer after they graduated high school
the @entity141 twins say the patients are the real allergy experts
