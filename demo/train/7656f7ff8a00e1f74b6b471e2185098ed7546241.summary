on december 17 , 2010 , @entity2 , a young @entity4 street vendor , set himself on fire and started a dramatic remaking of the political landscape			1
the striking of a match brought change not only in @entity4 , but also in @entity11 and @entity12 , and even what is happening in @entity14			1
on the other hand , as of august this year , about 48 @entity15 , mostly @entity16 monks and nuns , have self - immolated in @entity15 parts of @entity20			1
in march 2012 alone , seven people self - immolated , and @entity15 exiles in @entity23 have been setting themselves on fire			1
the political result ? nothing			2
so why does the self - immolation of one man accomplish so much , but the same gesture performed by so many others accomplishes nothing ? perhaps the question should be phrased differently , because a closer look at @entity2 's deed and the @entity15 cases reveals that it is something other than the sheer number of self - immolations that makes them a catalyst for change			1
two more @entity15 self - immolate in @entity20 protest tunisians could easily identify with @entity2 's extreme predicament			1
his actions spoke to the community 's shared frustration and despair			1
but the demands of @entity15 self - immolators are varied			1
some want a " free @entity59 , " as do all @entity15 exiles , but others only want freedom of religion , or political autonomy , or the opportunity to study in @entity15 as opposed to @entity20 , or the return of the @entity58 to @entity59			1
when a self - immolator like @entity2 is perceived as taking upon himself the humiliations and shameful submissions , the collective cowardice and voluntary servitude of his people , he burns off , along with his body , the diffuse sense of shame and guilt that has been paralyzing his community			2
the burning body thus becomes a site of cleansing , catharsis and regeneration			0
the community is going -- vicariously , but no less effectively -- through a " purification by fire			0
" and in the process an important thing takes place : that society reinvents itself , it is transformed from a shattered community into a political community			2
as the body is being devoured by flames , the promise ( if only the promise ) of a new beginning takes shape			0
the self - immolations of @entity91 in @entity92 in 1963 and @entity93 in @entity94 in 1969 were not very different from that of @entity2			2
the former was a @entity16 monk who self - immolated to draw attention to the persecution of @entity100 in @entity101 under the @entity103 's regime ; the latter was a philosophy student who did the same thing in @entity94 as a response to the @entity109 's crush of the @entity110			1
self - immolations that prompt political change are extraordinary and rare events			1
the ancient @entity114 had two different words for time : chronos for ordinary time and kairos for time of special quality -- a particularly propitious time for which our " right time " is a rather weak translation			0
for self - immolations to be politically successful , they have to happen in kairos			0
@entity2 , @entity128 and @entity129 had many imitators , but none since have achieved so much			0
that 's why the high number of self - immolations among @entity15 lately could be read as an implicit admission of failure			1
even though the first self - immolation by a former @entity15 monk , @entity139 , on april 27 , 1998 , in @entity140 , had some public impact , it failed to cause the political commotion that @entity2 triggered in the @entity144 world			1
nor have any of the other @entity15 self - immolators since			1
yet , this should not surprise us			0
there is a strong rejection of violence in @entity151			0
even through self - immolations took place in medieval @entity20 and 20th - century @entity101 , even though the @entity154 praises " burning for @entity155 " as the supreme self - sacrifice , @entity100 are very reluctant to condone violence			1
@entity151 , in particular , is centered on compassion toward all sentient beings and prohibition of murder , suicide included			0
such a religious and cultural viewpoint must prevent ordinary tibetans from identifying with the self - immolators			0
accommodating this radical form of violence within a culture that has for centuries fed on cosmic compassion and political non-violence is not an easy process			0
that is why the recent string of self - immolations in @entity15 parts of @entity20 is a sign that this could be changing			1
most self - immolators are young -- some are teens -- which indicates that the new generation of politically aware @entity15 might have lost patience with the @entity58 's nonviolent political philosophy and want to respond differently to the @entity20 's aggressive methods			1
what we see now is possibly the beginning of a new type of political engagement in @entity59 , a new pattern very different from @entity189 's and @entity129 's , who emerged from communities that had been brought to their knees			2
tibetans , instead , over the last 60 years have considered their nation as occupied , but not defeated			0
since 1959 they have with some regularity risen against the @entity20 authorities			2
it 's very disturbing to watch these self - immolations , but that is part of the intent			2
the @entity15 want the @entity20 and the world to look			1
the meaning of their gesture lies in its total passivity			0
it is no accident that after every self - immolation the @entity20 authorities scramble to confiscate and destroy any pictures taken ; they are only too aware of the iconic status such images can acquire			2
in essence , these self - immolations are an extreme form of political self - expression			2
they are performed as part of a struggle for recognition , as an autonomous political community			0
it confirms what @entity223 was saying in 1967 : " to burn oneself by fire is to prove that what one is saying is of the utmost importance			0
there is nothing more painful than burning oneself			0
to say something while experiencing this kind of pain is to say it with utmost courage , frankness , determination and sincerity			0
" for many @entity15 monks and nuns of today the burning body has become a tool for the most resounding of self - assertions ; when you are in flames your presence can not be ignored anymore			2
it is a shouting game of sorts , except that no party shouts			0
the @entity15 express themselves by burning ; the @entity20 authorities do the same by shooting @entity15			1
then , another monk or nun engages in self - expression and everything starts anew			0
@entity255 , a @entity15 monk who spent more than 30 years in @entity20 prisons and labor camps , once said : " for those who use brute force , there is nothing more insulting than a victim 's refusal to acknowledge their power			1
" rarely has the desire for recognition been so desperate and moving			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity270 .			0

groups : 48 @entity15 self - immolated in @entity15 parts of @entity20 without political change
yet a @entity4 's setting himself afire set off @entity144 spring , he says . why was that different ?
he writes : the @entity4 spoke to everyone 's despair ; @entity15 protesters have varying goals
@entity285 : @entity15 are nonviolent , but some may be tired of @entity58 's pacifism
