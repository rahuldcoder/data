-- @entity1 is n't just the lead actress in " @entity3			1
" she 's one of the book 's original fans			0
long before she landed the role of @entity7 , a bright 16 - year - old facing cancer , she sent the novel 's author , @entity9 , an impassioned , lengthy e-mail rallying for " @entity3 " to become a movie			2
" i did n't say i needed to be @entity7 , " @entity1 said at the movie 's @entity14 premiere on june 2			1
" i said i needed this movie to get made			1
because i knew that it would change the lives of millions of people			1
" if the movie version of " @entity3 " is anything like the book , @entity1 will soon be proven right			1
the adaptation , now in theaters , is faithful to its beloved source material , which chronicles the romance between two cancer patients with humor , intelligence and honesty			0
author @entity9 had already amassed a fan base when " @entity3 " was released as a novel in january 2012 , one devoted enough to earn him the title of " the @entity34			0
" but " @entity3 " has stretched far beyond its intended young adult demographic , selling millions of copies and sticking to @entity39 best - seller list for 78 weeks			2
young adult books and sex : what we learned under the covers @entity45 did n't name it " @entity51 " ; it recognized it as the year 's best book , period , the kind of endorsement @entity1 could get behind			1
the 22 - year - old actress , who is developing a reputation for pushing back against @entity55 's rules , recently explained to @entity56 the impact she thinks " @entity58 " could have			0
" in ' fault , ' i am trying to rewrite what a female lead can look like , " @entity1 said			1
" you 've never seen a woman on the poster for a movie with a cannula in her nose			0
" although @entity1 said she was n't gunning for the role of @entity7 when she wrote @entity9 , the author remembers that exchange a bit differently			2
" the letter was extremely long , like 40 pages long , and ... i did n't technically know who @entity1 was , " he said			2
" so i just responded like , ' that 's such a lovely e-mail ! thank you so much ! but i am not a casting director			0
' and then when i saw her audition , of course i was horrified that i had not written her back and said , like , ' please ! please ! be in our movie ! ' " of course it 's unlikely that @entity9 , who calls @entity1 " a gift " to the film , would have had to beg			1
@entity1 , who 's gone from @entity90 's " @entity89 " to high - profile projects like " @entity92 " and " divergent " in the blink of an eye , was game for the role , chopping off her long hair to accommodate the part			2
in the process , she gained something as well : " a deeper sense of gratitude " for life			0
" on this beautiful day , there 's kids at home in bed hooked up to chemo machines , " @entity1 reflected at the movie 's june 2 premiere			1
" there 's no way to justify it			0
so , really , it taught me a deeper sense of gratitude and a deeper sense of appreciation for these small palpable moments , because they 're the only thing that we 're guaranteed			0
