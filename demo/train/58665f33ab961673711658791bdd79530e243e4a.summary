-- from @entity4 to @entity5 to shopkick , lots of apps and websites help consumers save money			1
but how do we spend less on technology itself -- that digital drug we ca n't seem to get enough of ? how can we save money on electronic gadgets and services ... so that we can buy more gadgets ? here are 10 ways to stretch your tech budget this year : 1			1
surge protectors have saved countless gadgets from being electrocuted over the years			1
but new ones like @entity23 's @entity22 are even better because they save money on your monthly power bill by killing standby power ( aka vampire or phantom power ) that most electronics consume even when turned off			1
in my case , after installing two smart strips ( one in my office , the other on the entertainment center ) , i 've saved at least $ 10 per month on my power bill since august -- more than enough to justify the $ 30 cost of each			1
buy less computer ( or data )			1
processing power , bandwidth and chipsets used to mean a lot when deciding on a computer or internet provider			1
but most computers and data plans today are really fast			2
even when they 're not , software developers have made perceptible gains in making gadgets and data feel faster than they really are			1
so instead of paying for a top - of - the - line machine , blazingly fast speeds or unlimited data , consider a lower - powered but still functional alternative			2
you 'd be surprised how many people are buying too much computer or data for their needs			2
this is what i call my perpetual technology fund			2
it works like this : two or three times a year , i identify gadgets , handhelds , old phones , laptops and gaming devices i no longer use ( follow the dust ) and / or have no intention of using over the next 12 months			1
the ones with value that i choose not to give away , i 'll resell on @entity82 , @entity83 , or similar classifieds like @entity85			1
in some cases , you can expect several hundred dollars in " returns , " which , of course , can then be used to subsidize your next tech purchase			1
cut cable tv ( and buy your own cable modem )			1
like many tips on my list , this one , too , requires additional effort , but the savings can be immeasurable			2
first , stop renting a cable or internet modem if you have n't already			2
they cost less than $ 50 on average and quickly recoup the $ 5/month leasing fee			2
next , see if you can find your favorite shows and programs on streaming websites such as @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111			2
you may have to make a few sacrifices , but $ 100 a month in savings ai n't a bad consolation prize			2
use freeware as often as you can			2
after paying hundreds of dollars for accounting software over the years , i recently switched to a free online service			2
it does everything my old software did at no additional cost			0
and there are a lot of other freemium software products to help you do what you need for less ( or nothing )			0
so get clicky with @entity129 and see what 's out there			0
i know a lot of people get peace of mind when buying extended warranties on pricey tvs , smartphones and other gadgets			1
but the fact remains , according to numerous consumer reports , that extended warranties cost more money on average than what they might eventually save in the unlikely event your gadget breaks beyond its default warranty			1
this has certainly been the case with me			0
i 've had stuff covered under warranty			0
most of my tech survives without problem			1
and i 've had a few devices out of warranty that i paid for			0
but overall , i 've saved a lot more than i would have paying for extended warranties			0
my free accounting software says so ! 7			0
contrary to popular myth , refurbished electronics are often as good as new			1
for example , my friend just bought a beautiful macbook for hundreds less than it would have cost new			0
it came in a new box			0
featured those protective stickers that are always fun to pull off			0
even better , it 's still under warranty			0
most digital cables are created equal			0
i say most because i 've had a cheapo digital cable go out on me			0
but i was only out a few dollars			0
and most of the knockoff digital cables i 've bought -- including @entity180 , @entity182 cables , audio cables , etc. -- are still going strong after several years			0
together , they 've helped me pocket hundreds of dollars in savings ( which i use to buy more tech )			1
before you roll your eyes and let out a big old " duh , " remember that shopping online often requires additional patience before seeing significant savings			0
for example , if you need an item right away and opt for expedited ( and costly ) shipping , you might be better off to buy at retail			1
free shipping can take more than a week in some cases			0
but there are good deals out there			1
and even if you do n't end up buying online , you should research prices there first before stepping into a brick - and - mortar store			0
rechargeable batteries have come a long way over the last decade			0
in fact , batteries such as @entity209 's @entity208 now pack more than enough juice to power all your electronics			1
these ai n't your father 's rechargeable batteries , so start buying and start saving .			0
