-- @entity1 built a 15 - year advertising campaign around the idea that the best things in life are " priceless			2
" much as i hate to give ad execs their due , these folks got it right			2
today , we live in an era when what 's truly valuable is the intangible			2
a quarter century ago , 80 percent of the cost of value of a computer was in the tangible hardware			2
today , in a time when " knowledge workers " predominate , the opposite is true -- 80 percent of the value of a personal computer is in the software			0
the most neglected fact in business is that we 're all human			1
ask ceos about what 's the competitive advantage they have in their industry , and they 'll tell you it 's their corporate culture , their customer loyalty , their brand reputation or their ability to innovate and create intellectual property			1
none of these assets appears on a balance sheet			0
the balance sheet -- a 400 - year - old relic -- does n't truly capture the value of the hearts and minds that define what makes a sustainable , successful company today			1
learn more about @entity46 at @entity47 look at @entity48 , the most admired company in @entity49 ( according to a @entity51 survey ) , and analysts tell us that 80 percent of @entity48 's value appears off its balance sheet in intangibles that our 20th century version of leadership ca n't even fathom or calculate			1
i went to @entity60 in the early 1980s , and i was taught to " manage what i could measure			0
" and i was also taught in kindergarten how to count			0
maybe as adults , it 's time for us to reconsider what to count			0
as a founder and ceo of a company for two dozen years , i know how to count profitability and cash flow			0
these are the lifeblood of any business , especially in hard economic times			2
but here 's the reality that most ceos are n't talking about : profitability is a lagging indicator of success , at least in the long - term			0
three @entity84 professors three decades ago proved that a " service profit chain " exists such that a great corporate culture ( an intangible ) creates employee engagement ( an intangible ) that leads to customer loyalty ( an intangible ) that ultimately creates a profitable and sustainable business ( a tangible )			2
leadership in the 21st century is all about learning how to measure and value the intangibles in our lives since this is truly where value is created			2
are you focused on the intangible inputs in your life or company , or are you purely focused on the tangible outputs ? as i suggested in my talk at @entity107 , it was a question about " what counts in life and business " that led me to take my ceo hat off for a week and fly off to the @entity111 peaks , to @entity112			1
the teenage king of @entity112 was also a curious man , but this was back in 1972 , when he ascended to the throne two days after his father passed away			1
at 17 , he started asking the kinds of questions that you 'd expect of someone with a beginner 's mind			0
on a trip through @entity129 , early in his reign as king , he was asked by an @entity129 journalist about the size of the @entity132 ( gdp )			0
and the king responded in a fashion that actually has transformed us four decades later			0
he said the following : he said , " why are we so obsessed and focused with gross domestic product ? why do n't we care more about gross national happiness ? " now , in essence , the king was asking us to consider an alternative definition of success , what has come to be known as @entity143 , or gross national happiness			1
most world leaders did n't take notice , and those that did thought this was just " buddhist economics			0
" but the king was serious			0
this was a notable moment , because this was the first time a world leader in almost 200 years had suggested that the intangible of happiness is something we should measure , and it 's something we should actually value in government			2
for more on happiness and how we experience it , watch this talk for the next three dozen years as king , this king actually started measuring and managing around happiness in @entity112 -- including , just recently , taking his country from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy with no bloodshed , no coup			1
@entity112 is the newest democracy in the world			1
so as i spent time with leaders in the @entity143 movement , i got to understand what they 're doing			1
and i got to spend some time with the prime minister			0
over dinner , i asked him an impertinent question : " how can you create and measure something which evaporates , in other words , happiness ? " and he 's a very wise man , and he said , " listen , @entity112 's goal is not to create happiness			1
we create the conditions for happiness to occur			1
in other words , we create a habitat of happiness			1
" and he said that they have a science behind that art. they 've created four essential pillars , nine key indicators and 72 metrics that help to measure their @entity143			1
in fact , one of those key indicators is : how do the @entity112 feel about how they spend their time each day ? it 's a good question			1
how do you feel about how you spend your time each day ? time is one of the scarcest resources in the modern world			0
and yet , of course , that little intangible piece of data does n't factor into our gdp calculations			0
what 's true for a nation is also true for a company			0
my boutique hotel company makes a practice of counting intangibles in evaluating how the business is progressing			1
it recently sold a majority share to a well - regarded player in the hospitality business ( @entity231 , the private equity investment arm of the @entity234 family ) , which made the investment because of our intangibles			1
i understand a company is a magnet for people -- whether they be employees , customers or investors -- and that a reputation lasts a lifetime and a company 's reputation can last more than a human lifetime			0
admired firms such as @entity48 , @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252 and @entity253 have created the kind of intangible - driven companies that are helping to transform the world			0
at the end of the day , it 's all about human needs			0
the best business executives in the world are those who truly understand psychology and the nature of that complex beast that 's at the heart of all business transactions : you and me			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity46 .			1

@entity46 : key factors in making business successful are intangibles
the intangibles are what lead to the easily measurable profits of a firm
@entity280 of @entity112 *insisted* on counting " @entity143 "
@entity46 says the intent is to create a " habitat for happiness "
