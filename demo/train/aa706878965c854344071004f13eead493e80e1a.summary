some of the world 's fastest growing population centers in @entity2 and @entity3 are at greatest risk from the impact of climate change , according to a new report			1
the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) , published by @entity10 - based risk analysis and mapping company @entity11 , examined the climate risks and adaptive capacity of 193 nations factoring in population concentration , development , natural resources , agricultural dependency and conflict			1
a total of 30 countries were classified as being at " extreme risk " with @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 making up the top five most in peril , while @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 all ranked inside the top 30			0
the analysis , which forms part of @entity11 's fourth annual @entity36 and @entity37 , also assesses climate impacts on towns and cities			1
six out of the 20 fastest growing cities worldwide , including @entity43 , @entity32 , @entity44 in the @entity45 , @entity31 's capital , @entity47 and @entity48 in @entity49 , were also classified as at " extreme risk " by the @entity8			1
" cities such as @entity44 , @entity47 and @entity43 are vital centers of economic growth in key emerging markets , but heat waves , flooding , water shortages and increasingly severe and frequent storm events may well increase as climate changes takes hold , " principal environmental analyst at @entity11 , @entity62 said in a statement			1
@entity62 says the impacts on cities -- where infrastructures are already struggling to cope -- could have far - reaching consequences for not just local people , but for businesses , national economies and international investors			0
@entity44 is the commercial center of the @entity45 and its population is expected to rise 20 % this decade , says the report			2
but , as recent back - to - back batterings from typhoons has shown , it is very vulnerable to climate change and has the highest exposure to extreme weather of the top 20 fastest growing cities in the world , according to the report			1
@entity84 is currently dealing with its own climate - related tragedy which has left hundreds dead			0
according to @entity11 , the disaster could have negative knock - on effects for business , particularly locally - based technical companies , leading to wider disruptions to global supply chains			0
@entity93 faces worst flooding yet " as these megacities grow , more people are forced to live on exposed land , often on flood plains or other marginal land			0
the expansion of population must be met with an equal expansion of infrastructure and civic amenities , " @entity62 said in a statement			0
the best - performing countries in the report are to be found almost exclusively in @entity108 , with @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 all in the top ten			0
@entity114 heads the list of least vulnerable countries , while @entity117 is also considered a low climate risk , coming in 10th			2
the @entity119 is categorized as low risk , although some coastal regions , including @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 were rated as " high risk			2
" events like @entity129 , says the report , highlight how even the economically strongest countries with a large adaptive capacity can find themselves extremely vulnerable to climatic events			0
the report is released just days before the world 's population is projected to reach seven billion			2
" a huge task before us " the @entity141 @entity140 's executive director @entity139 described the milestone as " a challenge , an opportunity and a call to action , " at the launch of @entity148 report in @entity149 on wednesday .			1
