-- president @entity1 has done the right thing by asking @entity3 to authorize the use of force against @entity6 to punish president @entity7 for using chemical weapons on his own people			1
i say that even as someone who has been a sharp critic of the administration 's @entity6 policy and an outspoken advocate of intervening in various ways to try to protect the millions of innocent @entity6 whose lives are at risk , prevent the conflict from destabilizing the region and support members of the @entity6 opposition who share our values			1
the president , as he announced in may , is trying to steer this nation back to a world in which we are not permanently at war and we do not turn to our military as the weapon of first resort in any international crisis			2
the @entity34 of our @entity35 wanted to ensure that the decision to send our young men and women into battle could not be taken lightly			0
both @entity41 and @entity42 presidents have steadily chafed at those restraints over the course of the decades since @entity45 as traditional wars and formal declarations of war have faded away			0
@entity50 's proclamation of a " war on terror , " authorized by @entity3 , put this nation in a state of permanent emergency in which the commander in chief has had extraordinary powers			2
opinion : @entity42 should n't bail out @entity1 's floundering foreign policy that is unhealthy and dangerous for a democracy			1
a former constitutional law professor , @entity1 understands that although he has a limited reserve of power that could allow him to act alone , his power will be far greater with @entity3			1
the constitutional framework is designed be a check in the best sense -- to require our leaders to make their case to the @entity72 people , to act on the basis of reasoned arguments about the nature of @entity72 interests that will stand up far beyond the @entity77			2
and the @entity72 people should back him on this decision , for three reasons			2
first , we are protecting ourselves and our allies			0
we can not afford to live in a world in which nations can use chemical weapons with impunity			1
the taboo against chemical weapons is particularly strong , for good reason			1
dying by the breath we need to live holds a particular terror			0
the parents of the children whose shrouds we see could not protect them even with their own bodies , like human shields from a bullet or a bomb			0
the @entity72 stood by when @entity98 used chemical weapons first against @entity100 and later against its own people , to our shame			1
but we must not make that mistake again			0
chemical weapons are the weapons of the weak against the strong , which is why @entity7 , has been driven to use them repeatedly , according to @entity72 intelligence , when his back is against the wall , as it is now in @entity110			1
should chemical weapons proliferate , they will be the weapons of choice for terrorists			1
opinion : @entity1 , ignore the polls on @entity6 second , striking @entity6 now will be a strike to protect the @entity6 people , even if partial and belated			1
it will not end the massacres carried out with conventional weapons			0
but weapons of mass destruction are just that : weapons of mass destruction			0
a chemical attack that kills 1,000 today can kill 10,000 tomorrow and 100,000 the day after that			0
third , the president is asking us to do , as a nation , what a leader has to do			0
in his 2008 inaugural address , @entity1 called for a new era of responsibility in this country , " a recognition ... that we have duties to ourselves , our nation and the world			1
" we have those duties not because the @entity72 has some unique role or mission in the world , but because we are the world 's most powerful nation			2
other nations take their cues from our action or inaction , whether we want them to or not			0
if we do not act , we are signaling that the world has suddenly become a far more permissive and dangerous place , that taboos can be broken , and that despite the pious words of the international community , leaders can do whatever they like within their own borders			2
if we lead , other nations that take their responsibilities seriously as great powers will join us			0
a @entity161 veto may prevent the @entity162 from authorizing our action in advance , but a majority of the members of the council will not vote to condemn the strikes after the fact			0
it is now time for @entity3 to step up to its responsibility			1
the bargaining has already begun			0
but the use of force after the use of chemical weapons , with the world watching , is no place for partisan politics as usual			1
opinion : @entity1 's irony , @entity183 's agony unless a clear majority of @entity3 opposes any action , it is incumbent on all those members who favor some use of force to craft a compromise that gives @entity1 the power to use both force and diplomacy as president and commander in chief to restore the chemical taboo and do whatever he can to reach a political settlement in @entity6			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			2

@entity201 : @entity1 right to go to @entity3 about using force in @entity6
@entity201 : a world in which nations use chemical weapons with impunity is too dangerous
she says striking @entity6 now will be a strike to protect the @entity6 people , even if belated
@entity201 : it 's time for @entity3 to step up to its responsibility and support @entity1
