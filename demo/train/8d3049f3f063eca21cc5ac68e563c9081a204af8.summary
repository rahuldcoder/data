@entity0 -- when @entity2 lands in @entity4 's capital wednesday , the @entity6 message to @entity7 -- only 500 miles away in @entity8 -- will be clear : stay put			2
president @entity11 's trip to the former @entity13 state , ahead of this week 's @entity14 in @entity15 , is meant to reassure nervous @entity16 that @entity7 's support for separatists in @entity19 does n't mean he has a free pass for territorial gains elsewhere			1
the warning to @entity23 was summed up by a top @entity11 foreign policy adviser last week : " do n't even think about messing around in @entity4 or in any of the @entity26 areas in the same way that you have been messing around in @entity19			0
" added to the schedule only last month , the stop in @entity4 will supplement the message coming from @entity14 leaders gathering in @entity33 , @entity15 , who are set to announce the positioning of troops and equipment closer to @entity23 in @entity16			1
@entity14 needs to create ' high - readiness force , ' secretary general says those leaders also must confront the separate threat of militant islamists making gains in @entity43 and @entity44 , prompting more worries for @entity14 states on the eastern edge of the military alliance			1
that 's not to mention the very reason for the summit -- to determine how @entity14 's mission will proceed in @entity53 when combat troops depart at the end of the year			1
the global unrest , causing political strife for @entity11 in the @entity6 , could provide a new purpose for the 65 - year - old @entity14 alliance , which is suffering an " identity crisis , " according to one analyst			2
@entity23 official : @entity23 is emotionally in @entity19 , its troops are not @entity7 's actions in @entity23 have " required @entity14 to really adapt and change fairly dramatically , " said @entity65 , who directs the @entity16 program at the @entity67 in @entity0			1
" in some ways , @entity14 should thank @entity7 because it was really searching for its purpose , " @entity69 said			2
@entity72 @entity14 members that border @entity23 , watching the once - unthinkable breach of @entity19 's borders , are looking to the military alliance to affirm its commitment to @entity78 , which provides for collective defense of states under attack			1
@entity19 is n't a @entity14 member , though leaders did invite the country 's new president @entity84 to @entity15 this week			2
other former @entity13 states , like @entity4 , @entity87 , and @entity88 , joined @entity14 in the last decade , hoping to bolster ties to the @entity90 while increasing their own security frameworks			0
as reassurance to those countries , @entity14 leaders plan to approve the creation of a " high - readiness " force that places new equipment and thousands of troops in @entity16			1
@entity19 warns of return to ' full - scale war ' @entity102 officials say the move is meant to be defensive rather than a provocation for @entity23 , though initial reaction from the @entity106 -- which called the move an " external threat " -- foreshadowed a potential escalation in the crisis			0
@entity14 and @entity23 have agreed since 1997 that no permanent @entity14 troops will be positioned in @entity16 , meaning member states will rotate forces through bases closest to @entity23			1
@entity115 , @entity11 's top adviser for @entity117 affairs , said leaders will describe the new effort as a " persistent " force in the easternmost countries , rather than " permanent			1
" " we will see persistent rotation , persistent exercises to ensure that @entity4 and that other countries in @entity126 and @entity16 are provided the reassurance from @entity14 and the presence of @entity14 needed to meet their security needs , " he said			2
opinion : what is @entity23 doing in @entity19 and what can the @entity90 do ? battling @entity134 not on the official agenda in @entity15 , the ongoing spread of @entity134 fighters in @entity44 and @entity43 will nonetheless play a major role in @entity11 's discussions in @entity15			1
the president has said he wants to form a coalition of governments willing to take on the group , which has taken over huge swaths of territory and terrorized ethnic minorities			0
officials say that could include a role for @entity14 , though in what capacity is so far unclear -- after all , @entity11 himself has n't yet decided whether to undertake airstrikes against @entity134 in @entity43			1
western @entity117 leaders must also confront the growing threat of " homegrown terrorism " -- citizens leaving to fight with militant groups in @entity43 and @entity44 , and potentially returning to stage a terror attack at home			1
the host of the @entity14 summit , @entity163 prime minister @entity162 , already announced new measures to combat that threat after a @entity167 - accented militant was filmed beheading journalist @entity168			2
@entity134 video shows beheading of second journalist " there will have to be an acknowledgment that individual @entity117 countries , and certainly the @entity6 , are taking action , actively working militarily on issues relating to @entity44 and then potentially @entity43 , " said @entity171 , the director of the international security program at @entity67			2
@entity162 lays out plans to counter @entity163 jihadi threat @entity53 's future just as the @entity6 is watching anxiously the final outcome of @entity53 's recent election , @entity14 member states are wondering what their role will be there after this year ends			1
both candidates in the contested vote have said they 'll sign an agreement allowing @entity6 troops to remain there past 2014			0
but without a winner , the @entity191 remains unsigned			0
hanging over the decision is the security situation in @entity44 , which has completely unraveled following @entity6 troops ' withdrawal			0
neither @entity11 nor his @entity14 counterparts want the same thing to happen in @entity53			1
gunmen target spy agency in @entity53 " we 're moving into a world in which @entity14 will be less salient in @entity53 , but in which we want to capitalize on the lessons that we 've learned , the partnerships that we 've built , " @entity115 said			2
no expansion @entity14 last admitted new members in 2009 , but leaders are quick to note this year 's summit is n't about expansion			1
the appetite for letting countries like @entity213 and @entity214 -- labeled " aspirant countries " -- into the club has waned			0
it 's hard enough to get the 28 current members to agree on things , officials say			0
case in point : @entity14 is having a tough time convincing its members to spend more on their militaries , a requirement for membership			0
the @entity6 spends about 4.4 % of its gross domestic produce on defense , according to @entity14 figures ; the @entity117 average is 1.6 %			0
@entity14 's guidelines encourage countries to spend at least 2 % of their gdp on defense			0
" part of the reason i think this @entity14 meeting is going to be so important is to refocus attention on the critical function that @entity14 plays to make sure that every country is contributing in order to deliver on the promise of our article 5 assurances , " @entity11 said at a news conference last week			0
but analysts say as long as economic conditions in @entity16 remain bleak , countries will remain hesitant to ramp up their military spending , even as external threats grow			0
" the @entity19 crisis has been a wake - up call , " @entity69 of @entity67 said			0
" now , whether the @entity117 will hit the snooze button or not , again , i do n't know , but it has certainly shaken them , that they have allowed their military defense spending to atrophy to a point where they are now vulnerable			0

@entity11 's trip is meant to reassure @entity16 that @entity7 does n't have free pass
militant @entity263 ' gains in @entity44 and @entity43 also cause for *concern* for @entity14 members
summit was *originally* scheduled to address @entity53 's future when troops leave
