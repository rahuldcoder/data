the @entity1 and the @entity2 defined the world 's first space race , but following @entity6 's successful orbital rocket launch this week , it appears @entity7 -- particularly @entity7 -- is the world 's new epicenter for space rivalries in the 21st century			1
" in some sense we are already there , " says @entity11 , @entity12 deputy project director for @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity6			1
" the @entity18 have been very active ... ( also ) @entity19 , @entity12 and @entity6			1
it 's quite a competitive atmosphere			0
" the race will only ratchet up later this year			0
in the second half of 2013 , @entity18 will shoot for the moon with the aim of landing a rover vehicle on its surface ; building on exploration milestones in 2003 and 2012 with the first man , then woman , in space			1
@entity31 plans to send an unmanned probe into @entity34 orbit this november			1
last july , @entity19 's government set up the country 's first - ever cabinet - level office for space strategy to oversee the country 's space policy and related budget			2
and on december 12 last year , @entity42 joined the space club -- ahead of more technologically advanced @entity6 -- with the successful launch of an @entity46 rocket that placed an @entity47 into orbit			1
it was a controversial first for the poverty - stricken nation , yet the country has vowed more launches			0
@entity6 's own successful rocket launch makes it the fifth @entity54 country -- and just the 13th nation in the world -- to break the bonds of @entity58			1
space race as proxy for arms race ? however , many see the space race as a proxy for a regional arms race			1
" many people will say that everybody is already running -- that it 's already on , " says @entity11			2
" that said it 's all relative			0
" " it could be much worse			0
if you look at the percentage of gdp that 's allocated militarily it could be much higher			0
for @entity19 , it 's stayed under 1 % of gdp			0
@entity6 's is about 2.5 %			2
@entity12 ( @entity6 ) spends a lot , but there 's no official number out			2
it 's secret and difficult to ascertain			0
" @entity6 's launch of the @entity82 -- and its 800 - kilometer range -- could add to regional tension			1
if used to propel a ballistic missile , it could reach most of @entity12			0
and with @entity6 a strong @entity54 ally of the @entity1 , other regional competitors may be rattled			2
" @entity18 's main concern is that @entity6 will be ( used as ) one of the ( @entity1 ' ) first containment strategies , " says @entity89 , director of @entity6 's @entity90 in @entity14			1
" @entity6 's extension of the range of its ballistic missiles will be used to check or contain the rise of @entity18			1
" a @entity6 ballistic missile can now hit most of @entity18 's main eastern seaboard cities including the financial hub of @entity100 , the northeastern port cities of @entity102 and @entity103 as well as the @entity18 capital of @entity105			1
from apprehension to anger @entity14 's successful launch may be viewed with apprehension if not outright anger by its regional neighbors			0
" @entity42 will strongly condemn @entity6 's launch , " says @entity111 , but adds that @entity112 does not feel the international community would condemn @entity6 's launch			1
" @entity42 will ask ' why does the international community differentiate ( between the launches of the two countries ) '			0
it will consider that the world is applying a double standard , " says @entity119			0
on january 22 , the @entity124 @entity123 unanimously adopted a resolution condemning @entity42 's rocket launch from december and expanded existing @entity124 sanctions			1
with @entity18 , analysts believe the country 's official response to @entity6 's launch will be more muted but that @entity42 will pressure @entity105 to bend to its own line			1
" @entity42 will try to exploit the @entity6 's launch as hypocritical so they will pressure @entity18 to take that position ... to share that view that this is an example of the hypocrisy and inequality of ( this month 's ) @entity138 , " says @entity11			1
@entity18 was a signatory to that resolution , as was @entity19			0
" i do n't think they ( @entity19 ) will say anything in that the @entity6 program has been transparent , " adds @entity11			2
" they 've conducted themselves in a way that 's non-threatening			0
@entity6 does not have a nuclear weapons program			0
it has signed all the non-proliferation treaties			0
" but @entity119 of @entity6 's @entity90 disagrees			1
" i do n't think @entity19 will welcome ( the ) @entity6 launch , " he says			2
" @entity6 and @entity19 have many issues including ( a maritime ) territorial dispute			0
@entity19 's fundamental concern is that @entity6 becomes stronger and stronger			2
@entity6 's launch may , at least in small part , spur @entity19 's rearmament			2
" ' fully competitive ' looking to the future , the historical lack of cooperation between @entity7 's orbit - reaching nations alludes more to competition than camaraderie			2
" there 's been some cooperation ... i know @entity19 has launched one satellite at least for @entity6 , " says @entity11			1
" but in most other areas , science exploration , remote sensing , manned spacecraft ... it 's limited			0
" " if you look on a continuum of ' full cooperation ' to ' fully competitive ' it 's more leaning towards competitive			0

' @entity7 already in space race in some sense ' , says @entity13 's @entity11
@entity18 , @entity31 have moon and @entity34 *ambitions* in 2013
space race is proxy for arms race but ' could be worse ' , says @entity11
@entity6 rocket launch will not be condemned , says @entity186 's @entity119
