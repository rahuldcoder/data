-- behind every good war are many good women			2
using their feminine ( and in at least one case masculine ) wiles , the following five spies would make @entity7 proud			2
@entity8 was posthumously awarded the @entity9 for her spy service			2
@entity11 while @entity13 ( 1876 -- 1917 ) may not have caused @entity14 , she sure as heck kept it going			1
having spent time in @entity17 with her husband , captain @entity18 , @entity13 returned to @entity19 and sued for divorce			2
to make ends meet she took up exotic dancing and the name @entity11 ( meaning " the light of day " in @entity24 )			1
with her sensual performances becoming the attraction of the major @entity30 cities came the men and the gifts for her favors			0
many of these favors came from royalty and high - ranking @entity39 and @entity40 military officers			0
as @entity14 progressed , both sides became suspicious that @entity11 was spying for the other side			1
the @entity39 eventually put her on trial and , although the charges were never proven , @entity11 was convicted of espionage and was executed by a firing squad on october 15 , 1917			1
playing the seductress up until the end , @entity11 refused a blindfold , smiled , and blew a kiss to the firing squad as the fatal shots were fired			1

@entity8 @entity56 was born in 1914 and at a young age moved with her family first to @entity60 and then to @entity39			0
in 1940 , @entity56 , along with her mother and sister , escaped back to @entity60 just before @entity39 surrendered to @entity40			0
while in @entity60 she joined the @entity65 ( @entity65 ) , but her ability to speak fluent @entity39 soon caught the attention of the @entity68 and @entity56 agreed to become a spy			0
@entity56 was flown to @entity70 , where she teamed up with other female spies and traveled to @entity73 , @entity39			0
there they joined the @entity76			0
soon after their arrival , the network was infiltrated and many were arrested			0
@entity56 was ordered to return to @entity60 , but instead she stayed on and continued to pass information on to @entity60			2
eventually she was arrested again and interrogated by the @entity83			0
when she refused to speak , she was sent to a prison in @entity40 and then to the @entity86 concentration camp			0
on september 13 , 1944 , @entity56 and three other female @entity88 spies were executed by the @entity89 in 1949 , @entity56 was posthumously awarded the @entity9			2
@entity90 ( aka " @entity91 " ) born @entity92 in @entity93 , @entity94 , in 1844 , the beautiful @entity90 soon became the star attraction in @entity96 , social circles prior to the beginning of the @entity99			1
with the outbreak of the war , she returned to @entity93			0
when the @entity103 soldiers occupied the city , @entity90 mixed with the officers and soon gathered information on troop movements , which she passed on to the @entity109 forces			1
however , she is probably best known for warning @entity110 that the @entity103 intended to blow up all the bridges around @entity93			0
with this information , @entity112 , with a small number of troops , was able to surprise the @entity103 troops and drive them from the area			2
in 1864 , @entity109 president @entity118 asked @entity90 to carry letters for him to @entity60			1
the @entity120 captured her ship , but the officer in charge fell in love with @entity90 and let her escape			1
the officer , lieutenant @entity126 , after being courtmartialed and discharged from the @entity120 , traveled to @entity60 , where he married @entity90			1
after the war , @entity127 toured the @entity129 as an actress under the stage name of @entity132			0
@entity133 @entity134 , as she was known , was born in @entity135 , @entity94 , in 1818 but educated at a @entity137 school in @entity138 , @entity139			1
after developing a hatred for slavery , @entity133 returned to @entity135 and freed all her family 's slaves			1
she also went so far as finding where her freed slaves ' relatives were and purchased and freed them also			0
after the @entity99 started , @entity133 asked to visit @entity103 prisoners being held captive in @entity135			1
the @entity103 prisoners gave her information , which she then passed on to the @entity149			1
among the slaves she freed was @entity152 , whom @entity153 got a job as a house servant in the home of @entity118			0
this allowed @entity152 and @entity153 to collect and pass on information directly from the @entity109 president 's mansion			1
@entity133 effectively used the @entity134 moniker to make the residents of @entity135 think she was mentally ill. she would wear old clothes and bonnets and talk to herself			1
because of this , most people thought that her @entity168 sympathies were just a part of her craziness			0
@entity0 : @entity109 's plan to conquer @entity172 after the war , president @entity173 named @entity133 the postmaster for @entity135			1
when the citizens of @entity135 found out that @entity134 was an act , they shunned her			0
however , at her death , the state of @entity180 placed a memorial marker on her grave			0
@entity184 ( or was it @entity186 ? ) born in 1841 in @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity184 ran away from home in her early teens			1

in 1861 , @entity186 ( @entity184 ) enlisted in the @entity195 and over the next two years not only fought in a number of @entity99 battles , but also served as a spy for the @entity103			1
solders in her unit called @entity186 " our woman " because of his feminine mannerisms and his extremely small boot size			0
however , none of her comrades ever figured out that @entity186 was really @entity184			1
@entity0 : celebrity or look - alike ? this boded well for her spying , where she dressed as a young boy serving in @entity109 camps , as an immigrant @entity214 peddler and , most interestingly , as a woman			2
in 1863 , @entity184 caught malaria and deserted the army out of fear that hospitalization would reveal her true identity			2
in 1884 , though , @entity184 applied for and was awarded a veteran 's pension in which the secretary of war acknowledged that @entity184 was a female soldier who had rendered faithful services to the ranks			2
