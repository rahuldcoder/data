-- if @entity2 is re-elected on november 6 , he will owe more to his first lady than any president ever to win a second term			1
on tuesday night in @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity6 gave one of the finest speeches ever delivered at a national political convention			1
more important , it could have more impact on the immediate future of the country than her husband 's celebrated 2004 keynote address to the @entity18 in @entity19			0
why ? her speech tied the @entity23 ' personal stories directly to the lives of millions of voters struggling not to be the first generation of @entity27 unable to offer hope of greater opportunities to their children than they had , thus drawing a contrast with @entity32 as an unnamed but unmistakable caricature of privilege without shading her talk with negativity or animosity			0
what candidates ' wives are telling us in fact the overall emotion , and there was far more real as opposed to rhetorical emotion than any speech at this level in memory , was a feeling rarely conveyed in our political language today -- love			1
the first lady was not afraid to use the word love openly and often , in relation to working people of all classes , armed services families , immigrants , parents and especially to her husband and her children			1
and she was not afraid to show an emotional connection to her words in a performance that was as remarkable for its passion and sincerity as for its many quotable lines			0
first family watches like humor , authentic feeling is risky business in historic addresses , but the rewards can be a level of connection and a sense of strength deeper than any amount of lectern - pounding can drive home			0
but while these qualities , like the many others now being cited by commentators of all beliefs and backgrounds , help explain why the first lady 's speech already has a place in the history books , they do not explain why it may actually change what will be written in them			0
should that occur , it will be because almost for the first time in four years , she single - handedly brought @entity99 to tears and to their feet at the idea of @entity2 as president of the @entity27			1
insiders ' views from the @entity18 because however much the @entity2 campaign seeks to deny it , the fact is that the priorities , conduct and accomplishments of the @entity2 administration have been a disappointment to many @entity99			2
some have said that @entity2 's political high - water mark might have been election night of 2008			1
now four years later , he finds himself having to reinspire millions of citizens who feel that for too long he sought too many accommodations with those who did so much damage and who have always sought to destroy him			0
@entity6 has redefined black women tuesday night , his wife with the singular @entity27 title of first lady may have opened a path for her husband back into the hearts of those who had such high hopes for his audacity			1
it will be up to him whether to choose change over comity when a leader can not have both , and win the opportunity to give a second inaugural address that will be better than his first , as perhaps a second term may be more successful on more fronts than his first			0
for as mrs. @entity6 reminded the nation tuesday night , " being president does n't change who you are			2
... it reveals who you are			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity153 .			2
