the @entity0 is officially dropping its demand that @entity3 reporter @entity2 reveal a confidential source for a book and articles he wrote			1
at a hearing tuesday in federal court in @entity10 , @entity11 , prosecutors are asking a judge to approve a limited subpoena of @entity14 , according to a @entity16 official close to the matter			0
the subpoena is for testimony in the leak prosecution of @entity21 , a former @entity22 officer , who the @entity0 accuses of providing information to @entity2			2
the case has become a high profile test for the @entity0 and how it deals with reporters on leak investigations			1
the new @entity0 subpoena is now seeking that @entity2 verify that he wrote the book " @entity29 " and two articles in the @entity3 in 2001 - 2002 , that the published material is accurate , that he has a confidential source he wo n't identify , and that @entity2 verify that @entity21 provided on - the - record quotes published in a @entity3 article			1
the subpoena omits any request for the name of his source and of any information that could lead to the identity			0
previously the @entity0 contemplated asking @entity2 to provide the time and location of where he was , when he received the leaked information , a prospect that risked indirectly identifying @entity2 's source			1
the information requested in the new subpoena appears to align with information @entity2 has said in court filings he is willing to provide			0
@entity2 has vowed never to reveal his source for information on a failed @entity22 operation to sabotage @entity55 's nuclear program			2
attorney general @entity56 for months has said that he would n't force a reporter to go to jail over a source			0
recently @entity0 lawyers proposed dropping the request to identify the source , but still push for the time and location information			2
deputy attorney general @entity65 advised @entity56 to not approve the time and location request because @entity2 would likely still refuse to provide that testimony .			0

the @entity0 is now no *longer* asking a @entity3 reporter to reveal his source
the case has become a high profile test for the @entity0
