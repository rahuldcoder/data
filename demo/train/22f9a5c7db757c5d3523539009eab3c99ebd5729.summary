-- when film director @entity2 tweeted about getting kicked off a @entity4 flight on saturday , the airline responded in less than 20 minutes			1
" @entity5 - i know i 'm fat , but was captain @entity6 really justified in throwing me off a flight for which i was already seated ? " @entity2 tweeted at 6:52 p.m. " @ @entity8 hey @entity2 ! i 'm so sorry for your experience tonight ! hopefully we can make things right , please follow so we may [ direct message ] ! " the airline responded at 7:08 p.m. the airline contacted @entity2 personally to apologize for bumping the director of " clerks " off a standby flight , accommodated him on a later flight , and sent him a $ 100 travel voucher for his inconvenience			1
@entity4 did not immediately return calls or a @entity25 message for comment but posted a statement on its blog apologizing to @entity2 and explaining its " @entity30 " policy , which " requires passengers that can not fit safely and comfortably in one seat to purchase an additional seat while traveling			1
" @entity2 ' too fat ' to fly @entity4 but if @entity2 were , say , @entity36 , who worked in @entity37 , @entity38 , instead of @entity39 , @entity40 , would he have gotten the same response to his tweets ? " if the company is actively using social media -- and i think that most companies are using social media -- i think the consumer stands a great chance of hearing directly from the company and being engaged and having their issues resolved , " said @entity47 , vice president of communications for @entity48 , a large travel agency network			1
@entity4 has more than a million followers on @entity25			1
@entity47 believes the majority of travel companies now are using sites including @entity25 and @entity59 to get feedback from their consumers			1
" if someone feels they are not being heard , social media is a very visible way to tell your friends , the people that follow you , that you 're not happy and hopefully the company will be paying attention , " @entity47 said			0
@entity72 , editor - in - chief of social media site @entity73 , says many big brands are starting to dedicate entire teams to social media monitoring , because they know it 's important to respond quickly to negative comments before they become a public relations nightmare			0
yet there 's a difference , @entity72 said , between responding and being able to fix the problem			0
" for example , if you tweet that your plane has been stuck on the runway for four hours , @entity85 can respond to you , but they 're likely not in a position to do anything about getting your plane off the ground , " @entity72 said			0
@entity85 , which was n't involved in the @entity2 incident , is one of the most followed airlines , with more than 1.6 million followers on @entity25			1
@entity85 has six people who watch the airline 's social media presence			0
the team rarely handles issues personally -- instead directing customers to the right resource for their complaints or questions			2
" we consider ourselves more of an information booth rather than a customer service counter , " public communications manager @entity107 said			0
@entity107 says all @entity85 customers are equally important , but someone with a larger voice may get noticed , and responded to by the team , faster			2
@entity72 recommends using the company 's @entity25 name in your complaint to get noticed , as most teams are set up to monitor for these mentions			1
he also suggests keeping your character count short so that others can easily retweet and share their own thoughts on the issue			0
in her @entity73 article " how to : @entity128 on @entity129 , " media director @entity126 offers additional tips			0
" first , always remember that the person on the other end of @entity25 is , well , a person , " @entity126 writes			1
you will get a better response if you give your recipient some time to look into the issue before they respond			2
" she also suggests avoiding people at the top of the company , instead looking for people who mention user experience , community or support on their @entity25 profiles			2
most of all , it 's important to hit the normal channels first before going on a social media rant , @entity48 ' @entity47 said -- give the system time to work and only try the more high profile online complaints if the company does n't respond satisfactorily			0
" we 'd want to know about it not only because we want happy customers but because we want to make sure that that never happens again			0
