he said that the school has gone to the authorities but that @entity25 has not shared information about who is behind the harassing accounts			2
" we were very frustrated at that point , so what we decided to do is really get the parents in the mix , " @entity133 said			2
" and as we get information in , i 've been sharing that with our parents through our e-mail list service and just to make sure they know what apps are out there , what 's happening to them			2

" coach suspends entire football team after bullying teens want to be ' validated ' why are kids downloading these apps ? @entity232 , criminology professor at @entity233 and co-director of the @entity235 , says part of the appeal of platforms like @entity24 -- where you create a profile and allow people to ask you questions -- is the need for affirmation			1

" because it 's like , ' this is so great			0

' " i understand why kids do it , but there 's way more negatives than positives that could possibly come out of it , and if i were raising a son or daughter , i would be like , ' why do you care so much about people asking you these questions and demonstrating interest in you this way , because it opens you up for more harassment , ' " said @entity232 , co-author of " words wound : @entity273 and @entity274 , " a book for teens to be released in december			0

but @entity232 , whose site has numerous resources for parents , says parents can feel empowered rather than overwhelmed by being as actively involved in their kids ' online lives as they are in their offline lives			2
that means being familiar with the technology but not necessarily declaring sites like @entity24 and @entity25 off - limits			1
" kids do n't want to hear us preach and lecture about all of ( technology 's ) evils			2
they will immediately tune out , " @entity232 said			0

" constantly having these conversations with kids so that they know their parent is not oblivious to these issues goes such a long way , " he said			0

our kids are at stake , and we can not drop the vigilance of knowing what 's going on in their worlds			0
