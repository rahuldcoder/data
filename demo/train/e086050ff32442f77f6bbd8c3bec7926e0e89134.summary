@entity0 yourselves on the back , readers ! the pangolin is now a little safer because of you			1
last year , after i wrote about the illegal trade in these artichoke - shaped , scale - covered mammals , @entity11 readers donated more than $ 20,000 toward the shooting and production of an anti-pangolin - poaching public service announcement ( say that three times fast ... ) and media campaign			1
the @entity17 is now airing in @entity18 , which is a hub of the illegal trade			1
hosted by a @entity18 newscaster , the advertisement is expected to be seen on 60 national and provincial television channels in the country , and is airing on at least 20 stations as of this week , according to @entity26 , a environmental non-profit that commissioned the @entity17 " our native species , the pangolin , is being threatened by hunters and traders who defy the law to profit from nature , regardless of the cost to @entity18 's environment , " the newscaster , @entity27 , who was described to me as " the female @entity28 of @entity18 , " says in the clip			1
she continues : " if you buy pangolin scales or eat pangolin meat in restaurants , you are directly supporting these criminal networks			1
" the @entity17 ends with a call to action , asking viewers to call a hotline to report illegal wildlife crime			1
@entity49 scales are used in traditional medicine and were openly available in markets when i visited @entity18 in february 2014			1
@entity49 meat , a delicacy , was easy to spot on restaurant menus in @entity56			0
in an effort to curb demand , @entity26 also has posted banners in markets telling people that buying and selling pangolin scales is illegal and that the scales are " not a magic medicine , " said @entity64 , the group 's chief technical adviser			1
" we 've always focused on tigers rhinos and bears , and , now , organizationally we 're really prioritizing pangolins , which is great , " said @entity64			0
radio spots are in the works , as well			0
all of this was funded by the @entity1 reader donations , he said			1
the pangolin -- a scale - covered mammal that resembles an armadillo and rolls up into a ball when it 's threatened -- is thought by conservationists to be the most trafficked mammal in the world			2
i reported on this little - known creature last year after @entity11 readers voted for me to cover illegal wildlife trafficking as part of my @entity89 project			2
the pangolin 's celebrity has been increasing , as of late			2
@entity92 , the maker of @entity93 , featured them in a mobile game			0
and prince @entity96 helped raise awareness about their plight in a november @entity101 video			0
" the humble pangolin , a scaly anteater , is one of the most endangered animals because of poaching , " the prince said			2
" the pangolin runs the risk of going extinct before most people have even heard of him			2
" enforcement efforts also give cause for hope			0
this month , police in @entity115 arrested five pangolin poachers , according to @entity117			0
and in june , two tons of pangolin scales were seized in @entity119 , according to that non-profit group			0
if the pangolin is saved , it will be in part thanks to those efforts -- and yours			0
for that i 'm incredibly , genuinely , awesomely thankful			0
so here 's another heartfelt thanks to those of you who contributed to @entity132 's anti-poaching @entity17 -- and who took time to read and care about this bizarre - but - important little animal			1
i hope this public service announcement opens minds , and that similar work is soon be taken up in @entity138 , which is researchers say is another large market for pangolin products .			0
