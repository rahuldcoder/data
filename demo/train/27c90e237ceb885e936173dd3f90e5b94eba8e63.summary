-- @entity3 -- the land of otherworldly vistas , air travel - disrupting volcanoes and polite , stylish @entity5 -- already feels remote			1
in @entity7 , a lonely peninsula that juts out like a thumb into the @entity9 toward @entity10 , it seems even more so			1
here the weather can change in a heartbeat -- sunny afternoons quickly swallowed by icy winds and low clouds filled with fat snowflakes			2
it 's six hours by road from @entity19 , the @entity3 capital , but be warned : driving the twisting routes of @entity24 's wind - and snow - whipped mountain passes can be hair - raising			1
for those who make the journey ( a four - wheel - drive vehicle is recommended , as is a sense of adventure ) the region 's natural features , eating options and activities are worth the white - knuckle ride			1
@entity36 @entity36 may not be much to look at , but it 's only 45 minutes from a ferry terminus ( @entity39 3 , @entity40 ; +354 433 2254 ) that offers a shortcut to get here			1
the village offers lodging and eating options that include the new @entity46 ( @entity47 100 ; +354 456 2004 )			2
this puts you close to some of the natural wonders of the region , such as the bird cliffs at @entity54 and the beautiful beach at @entity56			1
there are just a few restaurants in this small fishing town			1
the best is the @entity46 's @entity63 og @entity61 restaurant -- it offers entrees such as foal steak , crispy - skin salmon , and seafood pasta			1
@entity68 the diminutive , charming town of @entity68 ( population 2,600 ) is located on the @entity72 fjord and is a well equipped hub for visitors exploring the region			1
its residents are proud of their remote , rugged location			1
" a common joke ... is that since there 's mountains on all sides , you only need a lid over it , " says @entity79 , an @entity68 native who edits @entity80 , an @entity81			1
" it feels like ... the mountains are protective of you			0
it feels like a haven from the outside world , especially to someone who grew up here			0
" @entity96 one of the best seafood restaurants in the @entity7 , and really all of @entity3 , @entity98 ( @entity99 400 ; +354 456 4419 ) , occupies a beautiful old building at the @entity68 harbor 's edge			1
here , @entity103 and his wife , @entity105 , serve the catch of the day and fresh vegetables in homey yet refined dishes along with a small selection of beer and wine			0
there 's no menu -- @entity103 cooks whatever is fresh , such as @entity116 catfish in a mustard cream sauce			2
the atmosphere is warm and comfortable , and the food simple and remarkably delicious			0
@entity120 just north of @entity68 , via a long tunnel that bores through a mountainside , lies the village of @entity120			0
this small community feels like it 's at the edge of the world , with stunning and dramatic views of snow - covered plateaus and mountains			2
a short drive from the town center leads up @entity133 , a mountain that locals claim offers clear day views across the strait to @entity10			2
( do n't get too excited -- few days are clear			0
) it 's also a prime place to see the northern lights during late autumn and winter			2
museum of @entity141 and @entity142 @entity145 , curator of the @entity146 ( @entity147 8 - 10 ; +354 897 6525 ) in the small town of @entity144 , looks the part with his gnome - like hat , wool sweater and pointy beard			1
@entity144 is located about 220 kilometers ( 135 miles ) southeast of @entity68 in the @entity153 ( or " the coast " ) region of the @entity7			2
the museum details @entity3 's macabre and bizarre historical belief in the supernatural , with items such as " necropants , " trousers reputedly made from human skin that were said to grant the wearer financial success			1
fortunately , many of the grizzly oddities in the museum are n't real			0
" the necropants are a replica , " says @entity145			0
" it is one of the fascinating folklore stories you find in @entity3 culture , but the story is good			1
" @entity173 this beautiful geothermal hot spring is located near @entity175 , not far from where the ferry to the @entity46 docks along the south coast			0
@entity180 ca n't really be called a town , but there 's somewhere to stay : the @entity183 ( @entity184 ; +354 456 2011 )			2
the hot spring is n't hard to find			0
there 's a parking area with a path down to the spring , which is situated against a cliff looking out at the ocean			2
at about 38 degrees @entity193 ) , it 's warm enough to soak in on a winter day , but easier to deal with than some @entity3 hot springs that simmer above 40 @entity196 @entity197 these lofty cliffs , @entity3 's westernmost point , are about a 90 - minute drive from @entity36			1
huge numbers of birds roost here , including puffins , northern gannets , guillemots and razorbills			0
at 440 meters , these are the highest bird cliffs in @entity209 and are a paradise for bird watchers and nature enthusiasts			0
the nearby @entity54 ( @entity213 , @entity214 ; +354 456 1500 ) is open in summer months			0
@entity215 @entity215 is exactly what it sounds like -- a red sand beach			0
it stretches for 10 kilometers along the southern shore of the @entity7			0
there are almost no facilities here , but it 's a great place to walk and enjoy the region 's natural beauty and isolation			1
in summer months , the water warms up to a brisk 16 or 17 c , so it 's possible to swim			2
there are no hotels or guesthouses in the immediate vicinity , but visitors can stay in nearby @entity36 to the north or the @entity175 to the east			0
@entity237 it seems like almost every @entity3 town has its own naturally heated geothermal pool , and the one in the village of @entity243 is a local favorite ( @entity245 ; +354 450 8490 )			1
the mountainous backdrop ca n't be beat -- bathers enjoy coffee and ice cream as they soak in one of two hot tubs or after doing laps in the main pool			0
@entity254 is a freelance writer based in @entity255 , @entity256			0
his work has appeared in publications including the @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 , the @entity262 and @entity80 .			0
