-- for the son of a math teacher , rallying legend @entity3 is not too concerned by numbers			1
age was no barrier when the @entity7 decided to pursue his motor racing career at 22 years old			1
the " late starter " went on to win a record nine world rally titles			1
now , after conquering the ice - packed slopes , desert dunes and rocky roads in the globetrotting world of elite rally driving , @entity3 says he feels like a kid again as he moves from rally 's all - terrain adventures to the uncharted territory of the smooth asphalt of the racetrack			1
" rally driving is the most fun driving you can have , because you slide , you drive on every surface , you jump , " @entity3 told @entity0 's human to @entity23 , with a twinkle in his cool , blue eyes			1
" but i needed to see something else			0
" i 'm like a young boy , even if i 'm 39 ! i 'm like a young driver again coming into a series and trying to improve			1
" after a decade of dominating the rally circuit , @entity3 has now set his sights on winning the 2014 @entity35 with his longtime team @entity36			1
this championship for racing road cars is the third elite series , in addition to @entity41 and the @entity42 , which is rubber - stamped by motorsport 's governing body the @entity43			1
it will test @entity3 on classic circuits from @entity47 in the @entity48 to @entity49 in @entity50 , and he has already been tuning up for his new driving challenge by racing a @entity53 sports car in the 2013 @entity54 , where his team is second overall ahead of this weekend 's race in @entity57			1
" there are different types of racetracks : some are really fast , some are really twisty , some have more or less grip , so you always have to adapt , " explains @entity3 , who has also tested a @entity59 @entity41 car but failed to get a race license with feeder team @entity61 in late 2009 and later said he was " too old " to start an @entity41 career			2
" it 's not easy to get used to the tracks , to get used to a different car , to another driving style , but i enjoy it			2
" it 's not like when i 'm in the rallies and everyone is waiting for me to win and if i do n't win they say , ' oh it 's terrible , he did n't win ! ' " @entity3 retired from fulltime rallying at the end of the 2012 season -- the championship already in the bag , of course -- while still at the top of his game			1
he chose to compete in just four rounds of the @entity42 this year , saying he had no interest in reaching a " perfect 10 " of world titles			1
" a lot of people ask me , ' why not 10 ? ' " said @entity3 , who won consecutive titles between 2004 and 2012			1
" the answer is because i do n't count ! " when i won my first championship it was the achievement of something , a realization			0
after that i said , ' ok , the rest is a bonus			0
' " it became less about pressure and just driving for passion			2
it 's not a question of numbers			0
" @entity3 was something of a late starter when he began plotting his career growing up in the @entity114 region of @entity7 on the border with @entity116			1
he first flexed his muscles as a champion gymnast			0
at three years old he was following in the gym shoes of his late father @entity120 , himself a champion athlete as well as a gymnastics instructor			0
one year later , the @entity123 was the proud owner of a red racing bike and soon showed signs of a competitive instinct , never missing any opportunity to go riding on the streets with his school friends			2
but @entity3 did not get behind the wheel of a car until , like any other teenager in @entity7 , he began driving lessons			1
" in my family there was no links to motorsport or even being fans of motorsport , " he explained			0
" so it was only when i had my driving license that i got to enjoy driving a car			2
then i started car racing when i was 22 -- not so young			1
" at that time @entity3 was earning his living as an electrician , a pursuit he describes as " not my passion , just my job			2
" on the side , he twice entered the @entity151 , an event for up - and - coming drivers organized by the @entity154			0
although he narrowly missed out on the title , his performances attracted the attention of former amateur racer @entity158 , who , in 1996 , decided to help @entity3 turn rallying from a hobby into a profession			1
" the person that helped me most in my career is @entity158 , " said @entity3 , who now runs his eponymous race team with @entity158			2
" he gave me the opportunity to start in rallies and is someone who is now my friend			0
" if @entity3 came to motorsport a little later -- most racing success stories are built on a junior karting career -- he soon recognized that he had a natural talent for driving			1
" since the start i was just natural , " said @entity3 , who now flies a helicopter as a hobby			1
" for me , it 's been more about talent than work			0
" the first thing you need is to get a feeling with the car			0
you need to feel when you have to brake and what speed to enter the corner			0
" in rally you need to try to be as close as possible to 100 % without knowing the roads really well , so you need a lot of improvisation in your driving			2
" the feeling in the car when you reach your limits , when you pull everything together to be the fastest , to beat the others , to be first , this is mainly the feeling i have driving the car and this was just my passion			0
" the combination of passion and raw talent attracted interest from @entity7 car manufacturer @entity36 , and in 2001 @entity3 stormed to the junior wrc title			1
two years later , he competed in a full season of the senior wrc for @entity36 , losing out on the title by a single point			0
@entity3 had made his mark , and his unprecedented era of dominance began the following year			1
numbers may not matter to the rallying superstar but , after nearly a decade at the top of the tree , @entity3 concedes this time age did play a part in his decision to quit while he was ahead			1
" i have other things to do in my life , " said @entity3			2
" it 's not like when you start and you 're 24 or 25 and you just want to do your passion			0
" now i have a daughter ( @entity224 ) and a wife ( @entity226 )			0
i have a good life , i have everything i need			0
it 's time to enjoy it and rest a bit			0
" i never have a fear when i drive but i know it 's dangerous , it 's one of the reasons i decided to stop rallies			0
" when you are in @entity241 , jumping at 200 kph ( 125 mph ) in the middle of the trees , it 's dangerous ! " @entity3 may be happy to settle for nine @entity42 titles , but his driving ambition remains undimmed			1
talk of retirement is for a distant time in the future -- a date to which @entity3 has no intention of counting down			2
" i do n't know , ( i 'll keep driving ) as long as i feel able to go fast , to fight for the win and as long as i enjoy it , " he said			2
" it will be a few years			0
" i think i will retire from all rallies soon			0
i 've really tried to prepare for the future to find something to do as a driver -- and now i think i 've found it			0
" rallying is difficult but racing ( on the track ) needs other skills and i still have a lot to improve and a lot to learn			2
" for now , the son of a math teacher and gymnastics instructor is going back to racing school .			0
