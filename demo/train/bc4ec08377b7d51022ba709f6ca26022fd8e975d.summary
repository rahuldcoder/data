@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity1 investigator said friday that an " external explosion " was the most likely cause of the mysterious sinking of a naval ship in which 46 @entity1 sailors were lost in tense waters off the @entity10 coast			1
" there is a higher possibility of an external rather than an internal explosion , " @entity12 , the co-head of a government - appointed team to investigate the march 26 sinking of the corvette @entity17 , said friday in a televised press conference			2
the @entity17 's stern section , where the missing sailors were believed to have been trapped , was raised from the @entity26 bottom thursday after a salvage operation that was made both risky and difficult by low underwater visibility and strong currents			1
the bow section is expected to be salvaged next week			0
of the @entity17 's 104 - man crew , 58 men were rescued from the sea on the night of the explosion			1
thirty - eight bodies have so far been recovered ; eight remain missing			0
@entity12 's comment was based on a preliminary investigation of the stern wreckage			2
he added , however , that it was necessary " to make a detailed analysis , leaving all possibilities open			0
" president @entity43 has demanded a transparent probe into the sinking , which defense minister @entity46 - young on friday called " a grave national security incident			0
" while @entity0 has avoided blaming @entity10 , @entity46 has said that a sea mine or torpedo appear the most likely causes			0
the media has been rife with speculation -- theories aired range from an internal boiler explosion to a @entity10 naval special forces attack			1
on thursday , @entity57 for @entity10 , a @entity0 - based radio station that maintains covert contacts north of the border , announced that @entity62 authorities are calling the @entity17 sinking " self - inflicted			2
" @entity10 's state - run media have been silent on the issue , and both @entity1 and @entity66 forces in @entity1 say they have not detected any unusual moves by the armed forces of the hard - line state			1
however , the @entity17 went down close to the disputed inter-korean sea border , off which fatal naval skirmishes took place in 1999 and 2002			0
if forensic evidence does point to @entity10 involvement , it is unclear what moves @entity1 could take against a country that has artillery ranged in on @entity0 , and which is believed to possess at least six nuclear devices			2
. the @entity66 declined to strike militarily against @entity10 when the spyship @entity82 was seized in international waters off @entity10 in 1968			0
nor did @entity1 retaliate in 2002 , when three @entity85 sailors were killed and their patrol boat sunk in a @entity10 attack on the same day that @entity1 was playing its last match of the @entity89 .			1
