-- @entity2 's kepler space telescope has already made a discovery , and its science operations are n't even officially under way yet			0
the planet used in the test is a giant gas planet about the size of @entity10 that orbits a star called @entity12 - 7			2
@entity2 scientists who put the telescope through a 10 - day test after its march 6 launch said this week that @entity17 is working well			2
its ability to detect minute changes in light has enabled scientists to determine that a planet orbiting a distant star has an atmosphere , shows only one side to its sun and is so hot it glows			1
@entity17 's ability to take measurements that precise at such a great distance " proves we can find @entity33 - size planets , " @entity28 , @entity17 's principal science investigator told reporters at a recent briefing			1
the powerful scope is looking at thousands of stars in its vision field in the @entity40 on a 3Â½ - year mission to find planets the size of @entity33 and to determine how common these planets are			1
the planet used in the test , a giant gas planet about the size of @entity10 , orbits a star called @entity12 - 7 in just 2.2 days and is 26 times closer than @entity33 is to the sun , according to @entity2			1
it is called an exoplanet because it orbits a star outside the solar system			0
@entity17 detected the planet 's atmosphere , demonstrating the telescope 's capabilities and giving astronomers what @entity2 says is " only a taste of things to come			2
" " it learned that this planet is like 4,000 degrees @entity62			0
and it 's 4,000 degrees @entity62 just on one side only			0
the other side would be closer to 1,000 degrees @entity62 , " said @entity66 , a professor at @entity67 and a @entity17 science team member			1
" this particular planet showed an unusual change in brightness , " she said			0
" as the planet is orbiting the star , it goes through phases just as the moon goes through phases as seen from @entity33			1
" " @entity17 learned something new about an old planet , " she said			1
" the new discovery was that planet is extremely hot , very , very hot			0
and it 's very , very hot on one side , compared to the other			0
" @entity28 compared it to " an element in your toaster or stove			0

@entity17 orbiting *observatory* *beginning* mission to find planets the size of @entity33
it has found that a planet orbiting a distant star shows only one side to the star
