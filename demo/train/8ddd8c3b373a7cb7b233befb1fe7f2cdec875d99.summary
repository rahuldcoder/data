@entity0 , @entity1 exclusion zone , the entryway is blocked by half a dozen police officers and a large sign flashing red lights			1
the sign reads : " keep out			0
" this is @entity1 's exclusion zone			1
no one lives here , a place where 78,000 people once lived			2
nearly a year after the @entity17 nuclear plant disaster , the exclusion zone remains off - limits due to high levels of radioactive contamination			1
my goal today is to see the town of @entity0 , a farming and factory community which sits in the southern section of the exclusion zone			1
it 's a town that was once home to 52,000 people			1
it 's hard to imagine that many people once lived here , as we drive into the center of town			2
that 's what strikes you first about the exclusion zone -- what you ca n't see , the people			1
even though i know the residents have been evacuated , it is still eerie to be in a town where it seems the people have simply evaporated			2
bicycles near a bus stop lie tipped over , as if owners forgot to retrieve them			0
cars sit in a shopping center , seemingly waiting to have groceries loaded into them			0
a @entity56 convenient store sits in disarray , the items shaken from the shelves from the march 11 earthquake			2
these communities are complete ghost towns , frozen in time			0
the signs of life can oddly be found among livestock roaming the region			1
we come up to cows grazing on the hill right off the main road			0
they stare at us , the visitors , and then return to grazing , as we drive off			0
we 're surrounded by what appears to be farmland , overrun by brown weeds			0
i 'm carrying two radiation meters with me , one to measure surface radiation and one to track how much my body accumulates			1
the surface reader begins to climb , as soon as we drive past the entryway , even though i have n't placed it next to a contaminated surface , which residents hope will be decontaminated within a few years			1
the release of radiation from the plant primarily covered the communities to the north of the plant			2
@entity0 , in the southern end of the exclusion zone , has a lower level of contamination than towns to the north and northwest of the plant			1
but a lower level does n't mean it 's safe to be here long			0
we stop in a neighborhood to check the radiation			0
on the pavement , the surface reads a radiation level of 0.042 millisieverts per hour , which is 10 times what you 're exposed to in a dental x-ray			2
not a significant problem since we 're in the exclusion zone for a short visit and wearing protective suits			1
but living on this street carries possible long - term health risks , especially for children			0
at a nearby park , contaminated soil sits under blue tarps			0
it 's the first hopeful sign of progress we 've seen , contained in this small park			0
but the rest of @entity0 sits empty , of people , of progress and an apparent future .			1

@entity0 was once home to 52,000 people
it sits in the southern section of the exclusion zone
except for the livestock roaming the region , there are no people
surface radiation meter climbs near entryway to exclusion zone
