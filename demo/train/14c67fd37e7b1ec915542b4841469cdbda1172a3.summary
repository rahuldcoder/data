-- defending champion @entity1 shrugged off an injury scare to beat fifth seed @entity3 in the @entity6 quarterfinals on wednesday , setting up a last - four rematch with 2011 runner - up @entity8			1
the world @entity10 pulled up and clutched his leg while leading 2 - 1 in the second set , but recovered to secure a 6 - 4 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) 6 - 1 win over the @entity15 despite moving uncomfortably between points			2
" luckily for me it was n't something that stayed there for long time , " the four - time grand slam winner told reporters after reaching his seventh straight grand slam semifinal			0
" it was just a sudden pain ... @entity3 makes you run , makes you play an extra shot , makes you earn your points			1
" @entity28 faces @entity29 in semifinal rematch however , the @entity31 revealed that he has been struggling with his breathing in the @entity34 heat			1
" i found it very difficult after a long time to breathe because i felt the whole day my nose was closed a little bit			0
i just was n't able to get enough oxygen , " he said			0
" at this stage of the tournament , when you 're playing somebody like @entity3 who has great shots from both sides from the baseline , makes you always play over five to 10 shots in the rally , your physical strength and endurance comes into question			2
" i think actually i 'm not concerned			0
i 'm really fit and i have no concerns of recovering for the next match			0
it 's just a matter of breathing better through the nose			0
" fourth seed @entity8 is searching for a first major title , having been beaten in the last two @entity34 finals by @entity58 in 2010 and then @entity1 last year			1
the @entity59 , also beaten by @entity58 in the 2008 @entity61 title match , ended the hopes of @entity65 24th seed @entity63 with a 6 - 3 6 - 3 6 - 1 success in their quarterfinal			1
" he 's definitely very motivated to win his first grand slam , " said @entity1 of @entity8 after reaching his fifth successive grand slam semifinal			1
" he 's been proving to himself and to the rest of the people that the @entity6 is probably his best grand slam			2
" but on the other hand i have been playing quite well here in last couple years ... it 's definitely going to take a lot of effort to be a winner from that match			0
" @entity81 was @entity65 's first @entity6 quarterfinalist since 1932 and the first male player from the country to reach the last eight of a major since @entity86 at @entity87 in 1995			1
next week he will move into the top - 20 for the first time in his career			0
@entity1 holds the edge in the head - to - head record against @entity8 , having won six and lost four of their 10 matches -- including victory in their only clash at a grand slam			1
that 2011 final defeat sent @entity8 into a minor form slump , but he bounced back to reach the last four at @entity100 , @entity87 and @entity101			1
" i 've always liked playing against him			0
after the year that he had , the loss did n't look so bad six months later , " @entity8 said of @entity1 , who won three of 2011 's four grand slam titles			1
" i 'll need to serve better			0
i had a sore neck today when i woke up and i was n't feeling all my serve			2
but i was returning good , hitting the ball clean from the back of the court , moved forward well			0
" thursday 's first semifinal will see second seed and 10 - time grand slam champion @entity114 take on @entity116 's @entity115 -- a winner of a record 16 major titles			2
@entity1 , @entity8 , @entity114 and @entity58 have dominated men 's tennis in recent years , filling the final four spots at three of the last five grand slams			1
at least three of the four top - ranked players have advanced to the semifinals in each of the last seven majors .			0
