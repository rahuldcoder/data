imagine a blimp city floating 30 miles above the scorching surface of @entity3 -- a home for a team of astronauts studying one of the solar system 's most inhospitable planets			1
@entity10 is currently doing just that ; floating a concept that could one day see a 30 - day manned mission to @entity15 's closest planetary neighbor			1
eventually , the mission could involve a permanent human presence suspended above the planet			2
deep heat also known as the morning star , and named after the goddess of love and beauty because it shone the brightest of the five planets known to ancient astronomers , @entity3 is a hot , sulphurous , hellish place whose surface has more volcanoes than any other planet in the solar system			2
with a mean temperature of 462 degrees @entity35 ( 863 degrees @entity36 ) , an atmospheric pressure 92 times greater than @entity15 's and a cloud layer of sulphuric acid , even probes to @entity3 have lasted little more than two hours			2
its surface is hot enough to melt lead and its atmospheric pressure is the equivalent of diving a mile underwater			0
but above this cauldron of carbon dioxide at an altitude of 50km ( 30 miles ) scientists say the conditions are as close to @entity15 's as you 'll find anywhere in the solar system			1
the gravity at this altitude is only slightly lower than that of @entity15 , its atmospheric pressure is similar and the aerospace provides enough protection from solar radiation to make it no more dangerous than taking a trip to @entity63			1
creating havoc known at @entity10 as havoc - high altitude venus operational concept - engineers and scientists at the @entity67 at @entity10 's @entity68 in @entity69 , @entity70 , have been working on a preliminary feasibility study on how robots and humans could make a @entity3 mission a reality			1
" the atmosphere of @entity3 is an exciting destination for both further scientific study and future human exploration , " said aerospace engineer @entity76 of the @entity77			0
" one concept is a lighter - than - air vehicle that could carry either a host of instruments and probes , or a habitat and ascent vehicle for a crew of two astronauts to explore @entity3 for up to a month			0
" he said the study showed the mission would require less time to complete than crewed missions to other planets and could even be a practice run for a @entity99 mission			0
closer to @entity15 @entity3 has the advantage of being much closer to @entity15			0
its minimum distance to @entity15 is 38 million kilometers , compared with 54.6 million to @entity99			0
" the kind of multi-decade mission that we believe could succeed would be an evolutionary program for the exploration of @entity3 , with focus on the mission architecture and vehicle concept for a 30 - day crewed mission into @entity3 's atmosphere , " he said			1
at the heart of the concept is the logistically difficult task of sending a spacecraft into the atmosphere of @entity3 without landing it			2
the havoc model involves placing the astronauts inside an ' aeroshell ' that would enter the atmosphere at 4,500 miles per hour			0
decelerating during its descent to just 450 meters per second and then deploying a parachute , the shell would fall away to reveal a folded airship			0
robotic arms would unfurl the blimp which would be inflated with helium to allow the airship to float 30 miles above the planet 's fiery surface			1
@entity76 said the key technical challenges for the mission include performing the " aerocapture " maneuvers at @entity3 and @entity15 ( the process of entering the orbit of both planets ) , inserting and inflating the airships , and protecting the solar panels and structure from the sulphuric acid in the atmosphere			1
" with advances in technology and further refinement of the concept , missions to the @entity3 atmosphere can expand humanity 's future in space , " he said			1
permanent mission ultimately , @entity10 could seek a permanent manned presence in @entity3 's atmosphere			1
suspended in a gondola beneath the airships , astronauts would not have to contend with the physical challenges of zero gravity , where weightlessness causes muscles to wither and bones to demineralize			0
and at a mere 167 degrees @entity36 ( 75 degrees @entity35 ) -- just 30 degrees fahrenheit hotter than the highest temperature ever recorded on @entity15 -- even current technology has the ability to contend with everything that @entity3 could throw at the mission			2
even so , havoc is envisioned as a multi-phase campaign and robotic missions would have to be sent to test technologies and better understand the atmosphere			0
while @entity10 has no current plans to fund the concept , the @entity68 - based team continues its work with the hope the space agency could make the plan come to fruition within several decades			1
" eventually , a short duration human mission would allow us to gain experience having humans live at another world , with the hope that it would someday be possible to live in the atmosphere permanently , " @entity76 said			0

@entity10 is studying the possibility of sending a manned mission into the relatively benign atmosphere of @entity3
the concept involves sending an aeroshell that would contain a folded helium airship in the planet 's atmosphere
at 30 miles above the planet 's surface , the gravity , atmosphere and radiation protection is similar to that of @entity15
the space agency says the mission could involve creating a floating blimp city for a permanent manned presence
