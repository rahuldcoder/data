-- the inaugural addresses of the presidents are , for the most part , a wasteland of howling rhetoric and dried - out inspiration			1
history has little noted , nor has it long remembered , more than a handful of them			2
@entity11 's two inaugural addresses stand ( of course ) as the great exception			1
@entity15 's addresses in 1933 and 1937 remain alive , as does the sonorous rhetoric of @entity18 's address in 1961			1
we continue to quote a single sentence from @entity22 's first inaugural , a sentence from @entity25 's first and a two - word phrase from @entity26 's			1
after that ... after that , you get a lot of this : " @entity32 -- liberty within the law -- and civilization are inseparable , and though both were threatened , we find them now secure ; and there comes to @entity38 the profound assurance that our representative government is the highest expression and surest guaranty of both			2
" who said that ? it could have been any one of 20 presidents			2
( in this case , the speaker happens to be @entity50			2
) writing a great inaugural speech must be very hard , since even many strong and important presidents failed to do it			1
@entity56 failed the first time , and since second inaugural addresses are almost always even worse than firsts , it seems almost certain he 'll fail again on monday			1
why do inaugural addresses fail ? they fail for two reasons : one subject to the speaker 's control ; the other , not			1
they fail , first , because the grandeur of the occasion inspires new presidents and their teams to overblown rhetoric , even as their political advisers steer them away from too specific commitments			1
@entity75 language wrapped around a thin message produces only vapid blather			2
consider , for example , this passage from @entity56 's first inaugural address : " on this day , we gather because we have chosen hope over fear , unity of purpose over conflict and discord			1
on this day , we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises , the recriminations and worn - out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics			0
we remain a young nation			0
but in the words of @entity97 , the time has come to set aside childish things			1
the time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit ; to choose our better history ...			0
" unfortunately for @entity56 , those words were false as description and therefore inaccurate as prediction			0
you might say that the line " we come to proclaim an end to ... false promises " was itself a false promise			1
good writing can never come from bad thinking			0
@entity110 : learning from @entity11 , @entity111 , @entity15 but there 's another source of failure , one not so easily corrected			1
inaugural addresses can fail even when the ideas are clear , even when the writing is fine , if the addresses make commitments that the ensuing presidency can not deliver			1
listen to this inspiring passage : " the elevation of the negro race from slavery to the full rights of citizenship is the most important political change we have known since the adoption of the @entity130 of 1787			1
no thoughtful man can fail to appreciate its beneficent effect upon our institutions and people			0
it has freed us from the perpetual danger of war and dissolution			0
it has added immensely to the moral and industrial forces of our people			0
it has liberated the master as well as the slave from a relation which wronged and enfeebled both			0
" it has surrendered to their own guardianship the manhood of more than 5,000,000 people , and has opened to each one of them a career of freedom and usefulness			0
it has given new inspiration to the power of self - help in both races by making labor more honorable to the one and more necessary to the other			1
the influence of this force will grow greater and bear richer fruit with the coming years			0
" " no doubt this great change has caused serious disturbance to our @entity172 communities			1
this is to be deplored , though it was perhaps unavoidable			0
but those who resisted the change should remember that under our institutions there was no middle ground for the negro race between slavery and equal citizenship			1
" those were the words of @entity184			0
between @entity11 and @entity26 , no president expressed a stronger personal commitment to equal rights for black @entity38 than @entity184 in 1881			1
yet this commitment is remembered today only by historians			0
@entity184 was assassinated in september 1881 , serving barely six months in office			0
even had @entity184 served a full term , his efforts would almost certainly have failed			2
federal enforcement of the voting rights of @entity172 blacks ; federal funding of equal education for black children -- to become reality , these aspirations of @entity184 's required support from courts , @entity196 and public opinion			0
none would have been forthcoming			0
@entity184 's aspirations were doomed to fail by forces of opposition too strong for him to overcome			0
@entity184 's noble summons went unheeded at the time and therefore inspires little interest now			2
an inaugural address is a plan for what is to come			2
even a good president can deliver a bad speech			0
in fact , they usually do			0
but however beautifully written , a speech can only be made great by the presidency that follows			2
an inaugural address is a plan , and the test of a plan is the result			2
a speech can fail all by itself			0
its ideas can be weak , its language can be foggy			0
but even if the ideas are clear and the words crisp , an inaugural address can be deemed " great " only if it is followed by actions that make good on its lofty words			1
this is why we still remember the mighty words of @entity11 and @entity15 and why we forget almost all the others			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity243 .			1

@entity243 : most inaugural speeches are full of rhetoric , lack real inspiration
he says they tend to promise great things but are vague on specific commitments
there are noble speeches that get *undermined* by lack of *accomplishment* , @entity243 says
@entity259 : we remember great speeches of @entity11 , @entity15 because of their great deeds
