-- @entity1 beat @entity2 on 5 - 4 penalties to win a pulsating @entity5 showdown in @entity6 friday after equalizing with the last kick of extra time			1
down to 10 men but leading 2 - 1 , @entity2 looked set to hand @entity10 the first silverware of his second reign until @entity13 found the net for the @entity16 champions to force the penalty shootout			1
both sides had a perfect record from the spot kicks until 20 - year - old @entity21 stepped up to deliver a tame effort which was comfortably saved by @entity23			1
so instead it was @entity25 , a bitter rival of @entity10 when the pair managed @entity27 and @entity28 in @entity29 , who landed his first trophy since taking over at @entity1 in the summer			2
for @entity2 , it was a second successive defeat in the @entity5 , having been beaten 4 - 1 by a @entity33 inspired @entity34 in @entity35 last year			1
but they will take heart from their performance in a match in which they twice led only for @entity1 to show their typical resilience by pulling them back			2
@entity43 put @entity2 ahead with a crisp finish from an @entity46 cross in the eighth minute			0
it was a lead which lasted until the second minute of the second half when @entity49 leveled with a 20 meter effort which beat @entity51 at his near post			0
@entity1 were on top , but @entity2 fashioned the best chances as @entity55 rattled the crossbar with a header and @entity23 was forced to save from a @entity59 header			1
@entity2 midfielder @entity60 departed for a rash challenge on @entity62 which earned a second yellow card and the omens did not look good for the @entity66 side heading into extra time			1
but those fears were dispelled when @entity69 lit up the @entity70 with a fine solo goal , @entity23 at fault as the eventual low shot eluded him			0
@entity51 made amends for his error on @entity49 's earlier goal with a pair of stunning saves from @entity79 and @entity49			0
but he could not keep out @entity13 's late effort which so cruelly denied @entity2			2
a defiant @entity10 said his team deserved better			0
" the best team clearly lost the match , we played with ten men for a long period against the @entity16 champions and we have only reason to be proud , " he told @entity82 .			0
