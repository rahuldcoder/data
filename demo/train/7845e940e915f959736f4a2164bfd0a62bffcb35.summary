-- photographer @entity1 snapped his shutter just minutes after the tornado reduced @entity5 's @entity4 to rubble			1
in that fraction of a second , he captured the courage and selflessness that overcame adults at the school in the moments after the monday devastation			1
" i 'd just arrived , probably five minutes after the tornado passed , and came into that neighborhood and noticed that school there and children pouring out , " he told @entity0 's @entity18			1
" it was pandemonium , with children crying everywhere , bloody teachers and so forth			1
" cameras ready , the photographer for @entity27 , the @entity5 area 's only daily newspaper , ran as quickly as he could to capture images from the scene			1
teachers save lives during tornado police and emergency officials had yet to arrive , but @entity1 said teachers were carrying and escorting children out of the debris that once was their school			1
the teachers themselves were injured , @entity1 said			1
one had an ankle injury			0
with rafters and torn brick walls as his backdrop , @entity50 , a brown - haired man in a t - shirt and shorts , clutches a blond girl -- one of his daughters -- in brightly colored @entity57 sneakers			0
she peers over his shoulder as he carries her away from the school			1
inside a tornado - ravaged school following him is his wife , @entity64 , blood over her left eyebrow and smeared down her face and neck , onto the frills of her v - neck collar			1
she appears to have a black eye , and she 's holding the hand of a crying , barefoot girl with a large heart on her blue t - shirt			1
" we 're lucky to be alive , and our hearts go out to those who were n't as fortunate , " @entity64 told @entity0 's @entity77			1
that 's what 's most important			1
" a teacher at @entity84 , she had the day of the tornado off			1
she and her husband were going to close on a house but they went to the school to check on their three children as the storm approached			1
" him , and i and the teacher just jumped on top of the kids and rode it out there , " she said			0
@entity50 told @entity77 that he had doubts			0
" i was truly fearful			0
i did n't think we were going to live			0
i thought it was just going to flatten everything out and we would probably die			0
but somehow or another everyone survived			0
mapping the twister 's 40 - mile path of devastation @entity1 said he was amazed by the adults ' response , especially those who gathered their composure to bring children out of the school , then returned to the rubble to search for more			1
police and emergency officials soon joined them in the search			2
@entity1 said he was moved to see distraught children and parents reunite at the school of about 700 students , located in the @entity5 capital			1
" the emotion of seeing parents come together with their children for that first moment , finding them alive and still well , was exciting , " he said			1
how to help another of @entity126 's photographs captured a child leaping into a man 's arms			2
the man cradles the child 's head with one hand and hugs his waist with the other , his face flush with emotion			2
the man is @entity138 , the child a 7 - year - old boy named @entity140			0
they are just neighbors , but the love and relief in the photo bespeaks the bond of blood relatives			0
hours after the shutter snapped and media around the world published @entity1 's photograph , details of their story came into focus			2
@entity140 , a first - grader , described the picture to @entity156 : " i knew that you were going to pick me up , so i just jumped			0
and i just started hugging you really hard			0
i was crying a little bit , and i was happy that i survived			0
" @entity138 said he needed the hug as much as @entity140 did			0
" it was so chaotic			0
we just were n't sure			0
the school was pretty much devastated and mostly destroyed			2
we were n't sure if anyone was going to come out alive , " he told @entity0 's @entity165			2
" to go over and see one of my favorite neighbor 's child emerge , it was awesome			2
it was just an amazing feeling			0
" @entity138 said it 's hard to believe a photograph of him and his neighbor is among the dramatic images of the storm transmitted far beyond his state 's borders			1
but the stories of recovery that the photos tell are inspiring to many @entity184 , too , he said			0
" it actually helps us , you know , in the healing process , " @entity138 said , " and helps us to learn and see that ... we have to depend on one another to get through these types of things			2
" @entity0 's @entity193 and @entity194 contributed to this report .			2
