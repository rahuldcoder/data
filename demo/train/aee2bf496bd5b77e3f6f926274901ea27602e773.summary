@entity1 's submission stands in contrast to the brazen relentlessness he showed in june , when he embarked on a grisly rampage through @entity17 , @entity18 , some 150 kilometers ( 93 miles ) northeast of @entity19			1
the carnage prompted people to shutter themselves in their houses and barricades to spring up around @entity17 , a city of 140,000 people that had no homicides at all in 2011 and 2012			2

" they ( police ) were screaming for about five minutes and they had their guns loaded , " the resident , @entity31 , told @entity29			0
" and eventually @entity1 came out with his hands up and he yelled , ' i 'm done			2
' and they collected him and brought him to my front yard , where he lay sprawled out			0
" the slain @entity39 officers were constables @entity40 , 32 , @entity41 , 45 , and @entity43 @entity42 , 40			0
