@entity0 -- while there is a short - term and potential electoral edge in @entity6 's selection of @entity7 as his running mate , it is politically risky and violates what should be the guiding principle in choosing a vice-presidential nominee : " first , do no harm			1
" in the end , the choice may do more harm than good			0
the son of a lawyer , @entity7 was born and raised in @entity18 , a city in the southern @entity19			1
his working - class credentials include driving an @entity22 wiener truck			0
@entity7 's rise in state politics began improbably in 1998 when at the age of 28 he handily won the open seat contest for @entity19 's 1st @entity27 in what was an otherwise disastrous year for the @entity29			1
opinion : @entity7 and gen @entity31 there is no doubt that @entity7 is charismatic , resilient and sharp			2
when he was a teenager , his father , like his grandfather and great - grandfather , died of a heart attack in his 50s			0
as a result , @entity7 has shown a consistent dedication to physical health			2
in early mornings in @entity44 , he leads lawmakers through regimented workouts			0
his swift ascent in the nation 's capital as one of the most promising young leaders of the @entity31 was cemented in part by his highly touted " @entity55 " budget plan			1
but in his home state , it is not clear how much @entity58 know about him since he has never held statewide office			1
as @entity6 slightly trails @entity60 in @entity19 , perhaps @entity7 could improve @entity6 's chance of winning over the voters			1
a survey of @entity19 voters from the middle of july tested the impact of adding @entity7 to the ticket and found that doing so would cut a six - point @entity60 lead to just a one - point lead			1
it 's hard to predict the overall statewide impact on @entity72			0
@entity19 is not a solidly @entity74 or @entity29 state ; it is a sharply divided , very middle - of - the - road part of the country			1
@entity74 candidates have carried @entity19 — sometimes by the slimmest of margins — since 1988			1
historically , it is n't clear that the choice of a vice president matters very much at all			0
it seems significant when the decision is made , but the top of the ticket is what voters care about			0
the things that make people like or dislike @entity6 — their own partisan and ideological predispositions , their perceptions of economic conditions , their level of satisfaction with the direction of the country — are likely to also determine how they feel about @entity7			1
the impact of the @entity7 pick -- whether positive or negative as we will soon find out -- will only be worth a few points in either direction on the national stage			2
given how close the election is , any major decisions made by either of the campaigns could be decisive			0
one of the upsides of the @entity7 pick is that it changes the campaign narrative			2
@entity6 has been taking a beating in the last few weeks			2
he desperately needs to shift attention in a new direction			0
since the choice of a conservative firebrand like @entity7 will be viewed as a daring choice , @entity6 may see a temporary boost to his campaign			1
unquestionably , @entity7 will help @entity6 solidify support with staunch members of the @entity31			2
most of them would have supported @entity6 in the end regardless , but @entity6 wanted to assure them that he is reliable and ideologically aligned to the @entity29 base			0
opinion : @entity7 will shift the campaign dynamic but a serious downside to a @entity6 - @entity7 ticket may be @entity7 's specific policy ideas			1
widely lauded in conservative circles , @entity7 's budget plan will become front and center in the campaign			1
this is especially true for the fundamental restructuring of @entity138 as proposed in the plan			0
@entity138 and @entity140 are typically viewed as the " third rail " of @entity143 politics , and presidential candidates have historically shied away from proposing sweeping changes to these programs			0
by choosing @entity7 , @entity6 all but guaranteed that these hot - button issues would become fodder for the @entity60 campaign , which will present a contrasting vision of entitlement programs for @entity143			1
it 's treacherous waters to step into			0
@entity6 has come clean about his conservative loyalties in selecting @entity7			2
it is worth keeping in mind , however , that this election will probably be determined by factors that have little to do with the vice presidential candidates			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity162 .			0

@entity164 : it 's not certain how much @entity7 can help @entity6
@entity162 : in his home state , most *wisconsinites* do n't really know him
he says @entity74 candidates have carried @entity19 since 1988
@entity162 : @entity7 's budget plan will push @entity6 's campaign to address thorny issues
