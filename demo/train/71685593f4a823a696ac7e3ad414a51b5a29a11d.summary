ever since @entity2 ' trailblazing novel " @entity1 , " time travel has been a staple of science fiction			2
the idea of traveling through time is deeply fascinating : you get into a machine , press a few buttons , and step out not just somewhere else , but " somewhen " else			2
it 's easy to imagine , but can it really be done ? yes it can , at least in a limited sense			0
over a century ago , @entity15 showed that time is intrinsically elastic , capable of being stretched or shrunk by motion			1
fly from @entity18 to @entity19 and back , and you will leap a split second into the future of stay - at - home @entity23			1
the effect can easily be measured using atomic clocks and involves only billionths of a second -- too brief for a person to notice , and hardly the stuff of " @entity33 " television series - style adventures			0
read more : scientists -- particles appear to travel faster than light but time stretching can be magnified by increasing the speed			0
close to the speed of light ( about 300,000 kilometers per second ) , time warps become startling			0
fly to the star @entity40 , 25 light years away , and back again at 99 % of the speed of light , and when you return to @entity43 in 2062 , you will have experienced only seven years travel time in the spacecraft			1
in effect , you will have leaped 42 years into @entity43 's future			0
so travel into the future is not only possible , we have done it , although so far in only paltry amounts			0
how about going back in time ? that is far more problematic and remains an active area of research			1
@entity15 found that not only speed affects time , gravity does too			1
@entity56 runs a little bit faster on the roof , where gravity is imperceptibly weaker , than in the basement , for example			0
a really big time warp requires an intense gravitational field			1
black holes are the best ; near their surfaces time is slowed almost to a standstill relative to us			1
indeed , black holes are black because outgoing light is trapped in slow motion			2
however , hanging out near a black hole is not only dangerous , it still only represents travel into the future ; it gets you to the future quicker			1
getting to the past requires something even weirder than a black hole -- a wormhole			1
read more : the great time travel debate wormholes in space are shortcuts linking distant points -- a bit like that other sci - fi favorite , the star gate			0
leap through one and you might come out on the other side of the galaxy a few minutes later			0
if wormholes exist , they could be adapted to make time machines that send you into the future if you traverse them in one direction , but into the past if you go in the other direction			0
like a black hole , a wormhole would be a massive gravitational space and time warping object			1
but whereas a black hole represents a one - way journey to nowhere -- jump in and you can never get out -- a wormhole has an exit as well as an entrance			1
do wormholes exist ? black holes certainly do , but nobody has yet glimpsed any sign of its cousin , the wormhole			2
furthermore , some physicists are so uneasy about their potential for being portals to the past that they flat - out reject the very idea			0
the problem concerns those familiar time travel paradoxes , like going back in time and murdering your mother before you were born			2
physicists call these causal loop paradoxes , and they affront our desire for the universe to be a rational and ordered system			0
if cause and effect get muddled up in time , what does that do for our notions of reality ? read more : ' @entity144 's ' potential for real world time travel in spite of these misgivings , there is nothing in @entity15 's theory of space , time and gravitation to forbid journeying into the past , a possibility that @entity15 himself hated			1
not only wormholes , but several other mechanisms have been found that , according to @entity15 's theory , can be used to travel back in time			1
all these proposals suffer from the problem of extreme impracticality , though			0
building a human - sized wormhole , for example , would require harnessing vast amounts of peculiar quantum field energy and deploying gravitational stabilizing technology that would need the resources of a cosmic super-civilization			1
for many scientists , however , it is the principle that counts , not the practical engineering			0
and here there is an intriguing possibility			0
few physicists think @entity15 had the last word on gravitation , and some modern extensions of his work make an extraordinary prediction			2
the @entity179 -- the giant accelerating machine that created the @entity181 -- might just make a tiny wormhole for long enough that its time - bending effects could be glimpsed .			2

nearly 100 years ago , @entity15 showed that motion could stretch or shrink time
fly from @entity18 to @entity19 and back and you leap forward a split second , @entity189 says
he says a big time warp requires an intense gravitational field , such as a black hole
going back in time would require a " wormhole , " which he says is possible in principle
