-- it was n't enough that jurors at the federal trial of @entity4 had to sort out sometimes graphic testimony from 72 witnesses and the 32 criminal counts against the reputed @entity9 mobster			1
they had to gauge the believability of unsavory criminals who had taken plea deals			0
" you were n't sure what you could believe or what you could n't believe , " juror @entity14 said tuesday			1
testimony revealing deep - seated corruption in the @entity20 and government during @entity4 's heyday left @entity14 disgusted with a justice system she called " tainted , " even now			1
" almost every witness that came through for the prosecution , i just had this feeling like it 's tainted			0
it 's tainted , " said @entity14 , a pediatric nurse and the author of several books on the @entity30			1
she spoke to @entity0 in her first interview since the jury on monday found @entity4 guilty of 31 counts			1
the juror spoke succinctly when asked to describe her gut thoughts about some of the trial 's key witnesses			1
@entity4 hit man @entity40 : " absolutely disgusting			1
" @entity4 crime partner @entity41 : " i ca n't cuss on tv			2
" mob enforcer @entity43 : " scary			0
... " disgraced @entity20 supervisor @entity44 : " there 's no words			0
there 's no words , absolutely disgusting			0
i felt like a traitor			0
" still , @entity14 and her 11 fellow jurors found @entity4 guilty of extortion , money laundering , drug dealing and weapons possession			1
they found he was responsible for 11 of 19 murders under a wide - reaching racketeering charge			1
@entity4 , who turns 84 in two weeks , faces a maximum sentence of up to life , plus 30 consecutive years in prison			2
@entity14 called @entity4 an " old , tired man " and said she was n't convinced he was a government informant , as prosecutors had alleged			1
known as juror number 12 , @entity14 told @entity0 the government " enticed " many @entity4 associates to testify by giving them " extremely outrageous deals			1
" " when you think if @entity40 killed 20 people in cold blood and basically got a slap on the hand in less than a year for each of those murders			0
i mean , for me , that was huge			0
" prosecuting attorney @entity79 , in closing arguments , defended the government 's plea deals with gangsters , three of whom together implicated @entity4 in the 19 murders and various acts of extortion			1
" the government did n't choose them , @entity4 chose them , " @entity79 said			1
" the only thing worse than making a deal with ( former hit man ) @entity40 would have been not making a deal with @entity40			0
" @entity79 said the government " held its nose and made the deal			0
" @entity4 ' @entity96 : fast facts @entity14 criticized @entity44 , who testified about leaking confidential information that led to the murders of @entity4 crime associate @entity100 and @entity101 , an innocent truck driver caught in the crossfire			1
" @entity44 walks away having been actually involved in two murders -- @entity100 and @entity101 -- and gets promotions and retires at a nice old age with a full pension , " @entity14 said			2
like it did with many key witnesses , the government cut a deal with @entity44			2
in exchange for his testimony , @entity44 would not be charged as an accessory to murder and would get to keep his pension			2
in court , he apologized to @entity101 's family for leaking information that eventually made its way to the reputed @entity9 crime boss and cost @entity101 his life			0
@entity4 declined to take the stand in his defense , telling the judge , outside the jury 's presence , that his trial was " a sham " and claiming he had been given immunity for his crimes by a corrupt prosecutor			1
@entity4 never specified what he gave in exchange for that alleged immunity			2
the judge barred @entity4 's defense team from bringing it up at trial , saying there is never any immunity for murder			1
gangster justice : how mobsters met their fates @entity14 said that aside from the testimony of @entity4 's cronies , she and the other jurors could find no supporting evidence in several murders that they ruled " not proved			1
" she said the jurors believed it was not @entity4 , but his crime partner @entity41 , who killed @entity153 and @entity154 , both 26			2
" @entity155 was present with @entity156 , that was something we could n't agree on , " said @entity14			2
" with @entity153 , we also felt that @entity41 killed her			0
now , was @entity4 present or not ? he had been involved and present at the other two murders in that same house , so it was hard to remove him from that			2
so yeah , but we felt pretty strongly that @entity41 was the one that killed the two women			0
" his defense lawyer said @entity4 was " very pleased " by both the trial and its outcome			2
" it was important to him that the government corruption be exposed , and important to him that people see first hand the deals that the government was able to make with certain people , " attorney @entity170 told reporters monday			0
prosecutors offered up extortion victim after extortion victim to show @entity4 conspired to collect " rent " from operating criminals in @entity9			0
@entity14 said she is convinced @entity4 was guilty			1
but she is still troubled by what she calls a " free pass " for those called by the prosecution in their pursuit of @entity4			1
" it was just pretty sickening to sit there and hear some of the testimony and the corruption with government and that -- at one point , i think one of the prosecuting attorneys talking about money laundering			1
and they were explaining once the tainted money goes into anything , every bit of money that now comes from that is now tainted			0
and i felt that way about the trial itself in a very real sense			0
" @entity14 said she is haunted by the vivid descriptions of killing after killing			0
" it 's still with me , " the juror said			0
" it 's hard to believe human beings can do this to other human beings			0
... i told my sisters , i 'm different , i 'm never going to be the same			0
really , i ca n't be the same after this			0
" @entity219 : another juror speaks about the deliberations @entity0 's @entity222 , @entity223 and @entity224 contributed to this report .			1
