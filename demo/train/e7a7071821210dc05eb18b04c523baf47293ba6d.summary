-- her story reads like the plot of a @entity5 movie : the little filly considered too small to race is now widely hailed as the best thoroughbred @entity8 has ever produced			1
@entity9 may not have the celebrity status of @entity12 's @entity11 or the awe - inspiring invincibility of @entity15 's @entity14 , but here , in the land of her birth , they could not be prouder of @entity8 racing 's most famous daughter			1
@entity9 first came to the world 's attention when she captured last year 's @entity23 , @entity25 's most prestigious race , beating a strong international field -- and the course record -- in the process			1
she followed it up with an impressive victory in the @entity31 at @entity32 this year -- beating @entity33 by a nose to become the first filly and the first @entity8 - trained horse to win @entity25 's two most important all - age races			1
and her latest triumph came in her native @entity8 , winning the @entity39 by half a length sunday against some of the best three - year - old colts in the country			1
but just two years ago , few believed that the delicate filly would one day be a champion			0
as racing fairy tales go , @entity9 's story has more than a few similarities with the story of @entity51 , the unlikely hero of @entity54 flat racing during the 1930s			1
impeccable bloodline although she boasts impeccable bloodlines ( her sire @entity59 is a former @entity60 and one of the most prominent stallions in @entity8 ; her mother , @entity63 , though unraced , carries the blood of great sire @entity66 in her veins ) , @entity9 was backward as a yearling and eventually consigned by her breeders , @entity70 , as a two - year - old			1
her appearance in the sales ring at @entity74 in the spring of 2010 failed to whet buyers ' appetites and she was eventually sold for just 9,000 euros to a former furniture retailer named @entity78			0
" it was the best deal of my life and probably the best deal in the racing business , " a delighted @entity78 told @entity0			2
sent to trainer @entity85 's yard in @entity86 for training , her two - year - old season was solid if not electrifying , belying few hints of her true ability			2
it was when , as a three - year - old , @entity85 stepped her up in trip to 2,300m that she first demonstrated her class , running third to the colts in the @entity96 @entity95			0
but it was on her return to @entity8 that @entity9 firmly buried her detractors once and for all , winning the @entity100 by five lengths and the @entity39 by seven lengths			1
arc triumph if the secret was out in @entity8 racing circles , few outside of @entity8 knew about the little bay filly with the incredible lengthening stride			1
which brings us back to that day in @entity111 in 2011			0
by now part - owned by @entity114 owner - breeder @entity113 , she was supplemented as a last - minute entry to the 2001 @entity23			2
" we had to pay 100,000 euros to get her in , " said her trainer			0
" the owners said they wanted to have a horse run in the @entity23 for once in their lives			2
they would have been happy with a good result or a place in the top four horses			0
nobody thought she would win			0
" it was a view shared by the bookmakers as she was sent off as a 20/1 outsider			0
but while all eyes were on the giant @entity12 favorite so you think , or perhaps on one of the @entity134 's stash of smart fillies such as @entity136 , @entity9 slowly but surely moved through the field , taking over the lead from @entity139 in the final furlong and eventually winning easily by five lengths			1
her winning time of 2:24:49 broke the course record held since 1997			2
" she took off in the straight and destroyed the colts			0
it was amazing , " says @entity85			0
training @entity9 has a special significance for him : a former champion jockey , @entity85 rode her sire @entity59 to victory in the @entity39 in 1991			2
amazing horse " the biggest feeling for me was @entity154			0
he was my first @entity155 winner and he was an amazing horse			0
but as a trainer i have to say that @entity9 is the best horse i 've trained in my time			1
" while @entity85 has masterminded @entity9 's career from the ground , her jockey , @entity162 , is heavily involved in @entity9 's preparations , riding the filly out most days			1
" she 's very easy , anybody could ride her , " he says modestly			2
she is known for her economical approach to training : " she just does what she has to			0
she does n't give you the feeling that she 's a @entity155 horse in the work but when the starting gates open she 's a different horse			2
" thanks to his association with @entity9 , @entity162 's trophy cabinet contains such silverware as few @entity8 jockeys have ever dreamed of , including the @entity23 and the @entity31 , which was presented to him by @entity184 monarch @entity183 " i think one of these horses comes along maybe every fifty years , " he acknowledges			1
" she 's a horse of a lifetime for me			0
" on the eve of her defense of her @entity39 title the " @entity9 effect " was very much in evidence in @entity74			2
@entity74 besieged nestled in the foothills of the @entity198 , the sedate spa town has been besieged by the international racing set			0
friday 's yearling sales drew an unprecedented level of international interest , with trainers and bloodstock agents from countries including the @entity184 , @entity206 , the @entity54 and @entity207 , all hoping to snap up the next @entity9			1
indeed , @entity9 has become something of an unofficial ambassador for @entity8 racing			1
so it is with interest that a nation expectantly awaits her next move			0
with the end of her career now closer than the beginning , @entity85 has mapped out her few remaining appearances with precision : after @entity39 , she will head to @entity222 where she will attempt to become the first filly since @entity224 in 1937 to defend the @entity23 , followed by a tilt at the @entity226 in november , where she will likely remain and be retired to stud			2
for @entity85 , who has been so closely associated with this dynasty , it is a bitter sweet ending			0
" it 's sad that she wo n't stay in @entity8			1
she has done so much for @entity8 racing			1
even if you do n't know racing , you 've heard of @entity9			1
but they have good stallions in @entity114 , such as @entity235			0
maybe they 'll send me a nice yearling to train			0

@entity9 rated one of the best fillies of all time
