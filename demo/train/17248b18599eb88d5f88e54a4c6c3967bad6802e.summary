3 - d television was heralded as the breakthrough technology of the 2010 @entity2			1
hot on the heels of @entity7 's eye - opening @entity5 , 3 - @entity3 were everywhere on the show floor			0
one year later , at @entity2 , @entity9 was back again -- this time iterating			1
we saw bigger @entity11 , 3 - d displays that did n't require special glasses , and camcorders that captured @entity9 content			1
but where is @entity9 now ? it 's certainly not showing up big on our @entity19 radar , and now looks like over-hyped technology in hindsight -- especially to those of us who always thought @entity9 's natural home was in the movie theater , not the living room			1
indeed , a variety of obstacles -- high prices , a lack of @entity9 content , and uncomfortable viewing experiences -- have kept @entity32 adoption in the single digits nationwide			1
manufacturers and content providers are working to address these issues , but one has to wonder if @entity9 was nothing but a flash in the @entity2 pan -- a technology story rather than anything consumers actually wanted			1
in 2010 , consumers purchased a paltry 1.1 million @entity32 units , and although sales have grown in the two years since , the widespread @entity9 fervor that tv manufacturers were anticipating never took root			1
according to a january display search report , just more than 23 million @entity48 were shipped in 2011 worldwide , with only 3.6 million shipped in the @entity50 display search analyst @entity51 says that @entity50 household penetration for @entity48 is at about 3 %			1
" to be fair , 3 - d tvs have only been available for sale in a significant way for about 18 months , so that 's why the penetration is so low , " @entity51 says			1
" that said , it 's still lower than what many in the industry had hoped for			0
" markets like @entity64 and western @entity65 are seeing far more enthusiasm for @entity32 than in @entity67 , but worldwide adoption is still likely less than 2 %			2
so what 's to blame ? the content , for one			0
" we have disappointed our audience multiple times now , and because of that i think there is genuine distrust -- whereas a year and a half ago , there was genuine excitement , enthusiasm and reward for the first group of @entity9 films that actually delivered a quality experience , " @entity72 animation chief @entity71 said in an interview with the @entity74			2
after " @entity5 , " a string of unsuccessful , rushed - to - market @entity9 flicks -- we 're looking at you , " @entity90 " -- zoomed to theaters hoping to cash in on the craze			2
moviegoers were left with a bad taste in their mouths ( and oftentimes headaches , too , as @entity9 viewing can cause eyestrain )			2
since then , better - quality 3 - d films like " @entity100 : @entity102 , " and , more recently , " @entity103 " and " @entity104 , " have tried to improve @entity9 's image			1
meanwhile , small - screen content providers have branched out to provide live and on - demand @entity9 offerings			2
currently , there are 55 3 - d channels worldwide , including @entity110 another 35 channels offer @entity9 content on - demand			1
if content and a disillusioned audience are the biggest problem , that 's bad news for manufacturers : they have zero control over the content side of the equation			0
to this end , @entity32 manufacturers are doing whatever they can to make the @entity9 viewing experience as pleasing and trouble - free as possible			2
this includes doing away with uncomfortable , unattractive @entity9 glasses , which have also been cited in studies as barriers to consumer adoption			2
@entity131 , for one , has announced it 's making @entity9 glasses that are lighter and more stylish			0
but even handsome 3 - d specs ca n't mitigate the headaches and fatigue suffered by some viewers of @entity9 content , or the high prices of @entity48			1
so , yes , 3 - d tvs are expensive			0
and they can cause headaches			0
and they are n't supported by a lot of quality content			0
all of which begs the question : who 's buying these things at all ? the existing sales , however paltry , can be attributed to consumer desire to purchase high - end @entity48			0
consumers do n't really want @entity9 specifically , but if they want that priciest , top - of - the - line unit , they 'll receive @entity9 capability whether they like it or not			0
" sometimes consumers are even unaware [ that they 're getting a @entity9 set ] at the time of purchase , " @entity155 's @entity154 said			0
whatever the reason for purchase , the most recent studies indicate consumers are slowly warming up to 3 - d. an october report from the @entity165 found that the majority of @entity32 owners say the experience is positive : 88 % of those surveyed rated @entity9 picture quality positively , and 85 % of those @entity32 owners prefer to watch more than half of their programming in 3 - @entity110 as prices come down , more content becomes available , and @entity9 glasses improve ( or are replaced by glasses - free technology ) , @entity32 adoption will only increase			1
whether we reach the near 50 % adoption rates that have been projected for 2014 and 2015 is yet to be seen			0
but whether you like it or not , @entity9 does not appear to be in its death throes just yet			0
yes , we 'll see new 3 - d displays and accessories at @entity2 next week , but you can rest assured the manufacturers ' over-reaching hype campaigns are over .			0

@entity9 television now looks like over-hyped technology in hindsight
23 million @entity48 were shipped in 2011 worldwide , only 3.6 million shipped in @entity50
@entity50 household penetration for @entity48 is at about 3 %
