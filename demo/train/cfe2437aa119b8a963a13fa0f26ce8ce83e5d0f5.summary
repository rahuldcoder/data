-- a decorated flight nurse who had been dismissed under the " do n't ask , do n't tell " military policy , will be reinstated with the @entity5 , the @entity2 of @entity3 announced tuesday			1
the @entity2 of @entity3 represented maj. @entity6 in a four - year - long lawsuit seeking her reinstatement			1
in september , the @entity9 for @entity3 ordered the @entity5 to reinstate @entity6			1
the court found that @entity6 's sexual orientation does not negatively impact unit morale or cohesion			2
on tuesday , the @entity14 filed an appeal of that ruling , but it is not seeking a stay of the order to reinstate @entity6 , clearing the way for her to rejoin the service			2
" i am thrilled to be able to serve in the @entity5 again , " @entity6 said in statement released tuesday			1
" the men and women in the unit are like family members to me , and i 've been waiting a long time to rejoin them			0
" there was no immediate @entity14 response tuesday to a @entity0 request for comment			0
the case is one of a number of challenges to the 1993 policy that prevents gay men and lesbians from openly serving in the military and bars officials from inquiring into a service member 's sexuality			2
legislation that would repeal the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy has passed the @entity45 and is expected to be voted on the @entity46 in coming weeks			0
in the summer of 2004 , @entity6 was notified that the @entity5 had begun an investigation into an allegation that she had engaged in homosexual conduct			1
she was placed on unpaid leave and told she could not participate in military duties , pending formal separation proceedings			0
in 2006 she was discharged on grounds of homosexual conduct			0
in 2008 , the 9th @entity55 ruled that the @entity5 must prove that @entity6 's discharge was necessary for purposes of military readiness			1
the ruling sent the case back to the trial court			0
saying that before discharging a soldier under the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy , the military must prove that the individual 's conduct hurts morale and unit cohesion			0
the requirement is now known as the " @entity70			0
" in september , @entity5 spokesman lt. col. @entity71 said the @entity5 believed that " @entity73 's discharge was fully consistent with the law and thus appropriate			2
" during her 19 - year career in the @entity5 , @entity6 served in the @entity76 .			1

the *government* files an appeal , but maj. @entity6 is being reinstated in the @entity5
the openly gay major says she is " thrilled to serve "
