@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 wants to question two men who were described as behaving oddly on a @entity5 earlier this summer			1
the @entity3 wants to speak with these two men seen on a ferry in @entity1 earlier this summer			1
members of the public and ferry workers reported the men to authorities after the two were seen pacing in areas of the boat , including a cargo hold , as if trying to measure distances , @entity3 special agent @entity7 said tuesday			1
the men were also seen about two months ago taking photographs of the ferries -- including restricted areas -- and studying an emergency evacuation poster			1
the men were spotted on multiple ferries and ferry routes , @entity7 said			2
the @entity3 wants to question the men to determine if their behavior was harmless or whether they were surveilling the ferries and ferry terminals for nefarious purposes			1
a ferry worker snapped photos of the men using a cell phone camera and gave the stills to law enforcement			0
the photos were shown to police and ferry workers , but no one could identify the men , so authorities called on the public for help			2
pictures of the men have appeared in media outlets for more than a week			0
none of the 200 tips that have come in so far has led investigators to the men			0
some news organizations have refused to publish the photos , saying the men have not been accused of a crime			1
it appears the men could be of @entity59 origin			0
although the initial @entity3 news release on the men did not discuss their possible ethnicity , " we just want to ensure that there is just one standard being implemented for suspicious behavior for both people who appear to be @entity59 and those who appear not to be @entity59 , " said @entity60 of the @entity61			2
@entity7 said the @entity3 made the photos public because " the result of not doing anything at that point in time is a ferry blowing up and thousands of people losing their lives			1
we ca n't let that happen			0
" more than 25,000 people commute daily through the @entity81 and more than 9 million people travel through the terminal annually , according to the @entity85 web site			0
but various @entity3 officials have stressed the agency is acting out of an abundance of caution and that the men seen on the ferry could have a logical and harmless explanation for what they were doing			2
@entity94 , also with the @entity3 in @entity81 , said the ferry system could be an attractive target to terrorists			1
" here the ferries are the equivalent of subways , so we are cautious , " @entity94 said last week when the effort to identify the men began			1
since the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , @entity105 law enforcement has emphasized the need for the public to report suspicious behavior			0
many such reports turn out to be nothing of concern			0
however , seizures of @entity115 materials overseas have turned up reconnaissance photos taken in the @entity105			0
e-mail to a friend @entity2 homeland security correspondent @entity119 and senior producer @entity120 contributed to this report .			0
