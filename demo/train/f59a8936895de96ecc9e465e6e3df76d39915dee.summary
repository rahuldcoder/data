editor 's note : @entity2 is host of the @entity4 show , " issues with @entity2 , " a topical event - driven show with a wide range of viewpoints			1
@entity2 is the author of " secrets can be murder : what @entity12 's @entity11			1
" @entity2 says the targets of stalkers are n't just celebrities and that millions are victims			1
@entity19 ( @entity20 ) -- @entity22 starlet @entity21 recently obtained a restraining order against a man who she claims had been stalking her since 2007			0
the man sent hundreds of threatening letters , as well as plane tickets to @entity28 , and he left flowers at the home of @entity21 's mother			0
@entity32 had even more frightening brushes with her stalker before he was convicted			0
@entity35 visited her house and also tried to get into her on - set trailer			1
@entity38 eventually faced @entity39 in court , where he was convicted of stalking and aggravated harassment and sentenced to three years probation and psychiatric counseling			1
this , to me , sounds like a victory for @entity39 , since he was placed in the same courtroom as his victim and could eventually go right back to stalking			0
many assume this type of thing is relegated only to those who grace the covers of gossip magazines and movie posters			0
@entity56 was n't famous , but that did n't save her			1
police in @entity59 say @entity60 was killed by her stalker last may , two weeks after taking out a restraining order against him			1
a new study published this month by the @entity64 's @entity63 estimated based on a survey that 3.4 million @entity12 per year are victims of stalking			1
for some perspective , that 's more than the entire population of @entity70 , @entity71			0
the comprehensive study found that divorced or separated individuals are at the highest risk of being stalked			1
women are more than twice as likely as men to be stalked , and two thirds of female victims are stalked by males			1
it is becoming an epidemic -- 1.4 million @entity12 were stalked a decade ago , according to a similar @entity64 study , and new technology is partly responsible for the increase			1
texting , e-mailing and social networking sites make it easier to connect with friends			0
but they also make it easier for stalkers to connect with -- and track -- their targets			0
i recently saw a cellphone advertisement promoting an application that allows the user to track friends on a map and see what they 're doing			0
the ad sent chills up my spine			0
what a tool that would be for someone 's obsessed ex-lover			0
@entity12 's law enforcement system does n't play a dominant role in deterring stalking			1
most incidents are n't reported by the victims			1
and according to the study , of the victims surveyed , 15 percent credited law enforcement warnings for keeping their stalker in line while only 10 percent said a restraining order did the trick			1
even locking stalkers up only works until they 're free			0
only 6 percent of victims said the stalking stopped after the offender was arrested or incarcerated			2
stalkers often have underlying psychological problems or are socially incompetent , and about 30 percent have delusional disorders , according to a study in the @entity127			2
so trying to solve stalking cases through legal means is like trying to clear a roach problem without getting rid of the food lying around			2
the @entity127 study recommends a mixture of legal action and therapeutic intervention			1
but intervention must happen early			0
troubled children who get no counseling could grow up and develop the dysfunctional traits identified in the @entity127 study			1
in elementary school we should teach nonviolent conflict resolution and healthy communication skills , which will help children cope with issues like rejection and sexuality later in life			0
i 've been stalked and it was one of the most terrifying experiences of my life			2
i can say firsthand that it becomes a hunter - prey relationship			2
so we must try psychological approaches that emphasize healthy interaction between consenting persons			0
therapy could help early offenders see their victims as humans again , instead of objects			2
some stalkers show addictive behavior , and their victim is the drug			0
just as marijuana is seen as a gateway drug , i believe stalking is a gateway crime that leads to violence and even murder			2
this approach provides another angle from which to attack the problem			0
unlike other crimes , stalking crosses all classes , races , and age groups			0
this makes it difficult to pin down causes , but provides opportunities to try out these creative and inexpensive prevention techniques			0
but we can only change our approach to this problem if victims speak up			2
approximately 60 percent of stalking victims do n't report to the police , according to the @entity64 study			1
though law enforcement alone is n't the answer , imagine if all 3.4 million victims had reported			1
it would provide authorities with a much larger pool of information			0
and with such a large number of people affected , it becomes a problem politicians ca n't ignore			2
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : new study says 3 million - plus @entity12 are stalked
she says most victims do n't report the crime to law enforcement
@entity2 : few cases wind up being resolved by police and court action
she says we need to do counseling and victims need to come forward
