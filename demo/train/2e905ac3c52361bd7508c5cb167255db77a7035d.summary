@entity1 -- " good afternoon , " @entity0 calls out over the din of the seventh - grade @entity5 class taking their seats inside @entity10 's @entity9			1
" good afternoon , " the class repeats before reciting the school 's code of conduct			1
a hush comes over the room when @entity0 holds up three fingers , signaling a student to stop talking , her compact frame pacing across the front of the classroom			2
" we 're not speaking , " she scolds , her face stern			0
@entity0 's no - nonsense approach is the @entity10 way , and motto : " excellence			1
" and that teaching style is getting results : better test scores , more college - bound students			1
but in other @entity1 communities , student walkouts and community unrest are raising questions about charter - based turnaround programs			1
some said their public schools have n't been given a chance to succeed			1
some do n't trust charter school operators			1
similar debates are happening in school districts across the country , from @entity46 , @entity47 , to @entity48			1
nationwide , more than 1.6 million public school students attend nearly 5,000 publicly funded , independently operated charter schools			1
charters were first established in @entity52 in 1997 , and there are now 135 charter schools with more than 50,000 students			1
success in @entity57 in 2005 , the @entity58 asked the @entity57 - based charter school operator @entity10 to take over some of the city 's violent , low - performing schools , including @entity61			1
since then , @entity52 state test results show that @entity61 's seventh - graders are scoring 80 % proficient in math and 66 % proficient in reading , up from 16 % in math and 20 % in reading			1
it will graduate its first class this year			0
senior @entity70 attended @entity61 before @entity71 took over , when it was a failing middle school on the city 's north side			1
" if the school stayed the same , i would not be going to college , " said @entity70 , who will attend the @entity75 with a partial cycling scholarship in the fall			0
" when i was in middle school at @entity61 , i did n't really care about even going to high school			1
all i cared about was going out there and making that money			0
" @entity10 's academic gains caught the attention of president @entity86 , who recognized the charter school provider in a speech to the @entity89 in july			1
in september , talk show host @entity92 , through her @entity90 , gave @entity10 $ 1 million to continue its teaching efforts in @entity1			1
the gift came on the eve of the release of the controversial documentary " @entity103 , " which touted charter schools as a possible solution to public education 's biggest problems			1
today at @entity61 , droves of students wearing a uniform of white polo shirt and khakis quietly make their way down the hallway during the change of classes			0
as they pass the dean 's office , an oversized hand - painted poster of @entity92 watches over them			0
" my students have just as much potential as every other student in the country , regardless of what zip code they were born into , regardless of what social - economic level they were born into			1
and , our students the past five years have proven that , " said @entity0 , a former traditional @entity1 public school teacher turned co-founder of the @entity9			1
" there 's no debate around it anymore			2
" in january , the district announced 18 public schools were slated for turnaround as part of the city 's @entity135			2
six more schools will become charter schools , two of them overseen by music mogul @entity142 's @entity141			1
@entity141 received a $ 500,000 planning grant from the @entity145 @entity144 to develop a @entity146 within an impoverished area of south @entity57			0
the area will offer intensive social services for children with the aim of improving educational outcomes			0
@entity153 in @entity1 is on the list			0
@entity141 pledges to revamp @entity155 and create a neighborhood similar to the @entity157 , led by @entity158 , which is designed to keep student on track through college by focusing on a specific geographic area while providing a comprehensive range of services			0
some students , teachers and community members are n't sold on the plan			2
another school , another debate @entity155 was closed by the school district in 2005 because of its failing status			2
after erecting a new building and hiring new staff , it reopened as a public school with a clean slate in 2008			0
this year , @entity155 students took state standardized tests for the first time since it reopened , but results are n't in yet			2
according to the district 's predictive assessment , @entity155 has 37 % of students proficient or advanced in math and 38 % proficient or advanced in @entity5			2
still , many thought the new school and staff were making great strides			0
some are n't convinced charter schools can solve their problems , and they 're leery of @entity141 , which has operated in the city since the 1990s but has never before operated a charter high school			1
the @entity202 's " @entity201 " program encourages charter school expansions , but the @entity196 on @entity197 warns that that the schools are n't an automatic success			1
according to a 2009 @entity210 report , " @entity203 and localities can use charter schools as a tool for better schools , but they must be prepared to close charter schools when they fail to succeed			1
some states rarely close a charter school ; others consider it a regular and necessary function			1
" @entity215 , an @entity5 teacher at @entity216 , was shocked to learn her school would be converted to a charter school			1
" it 's a short - term solution for a long - term problem , " @entity215 said of the charter takeover			2
" in the end you will underserve more students in the future			0
" students and parents were upset , too , saying it was too soon to label @entity155 a failure			2
" recognizing that a ' one - size fits all ' approach would not yield maximum results , i encourage parents and community members to take an active part in the process , " superintendent of schools @entity230 said in a statement regarding the changes			2
in february , frustrated @entity155 students staged a walkout , saying they had been displaced enough already and did not want to convert to a charter operated by @entity141			2
the walkout was one of three protests in a single week by district teens upset that their schools were slated for overhauls			0
@entity252 , a junior at @entity216 , led her classmates in protest			0
although not totally opposed to charter takeovers , @entity255 said her school has the right mix of student and teachers and fears the new operators will disrupt their progress			1
" we should have a say in what they were trying to do to our school , " she said			0
" just because it turns into a charter school does n't mean it 's going to be a good school			1
" @entity215 , who allowed her students to leave school to attend the protest rally , was removed from the classroom after the walkout			1
the district said her actions endangered students			0
@entity215 waited out the suspension in the district 's " rubber room " while officials decided her job status			0
she returned to her classroom in march			0
" there was no justification for why they considered @entity155 a failing school , " she said , adding that the decision was made before standardized tests scores were available			2
there are more challenges ahead for @entity52 schools , too			0
in april , the district announced that it stands to lose $ 292 million in funding , or 10 % , if gov. @entity298 's state budget is passed			0
the overall school operating budget would be reduced from $ 3.2 million to $ 2.7 billion			0
as a result , @entity1 would need to cut the work force by more than 3,800 positions , including 1,260 teachers and a 50 % personnel reduction at district headquarters			0
" this is unprecedented , " @entity306 , the district 's chief financial officer , said at a recent school board meeting			2
" but we have to balance the budget			0
" @entity313 ' grandfather and community activist , @entity255 , is concerned the district and @entity141 do not have the best interests of the students in mind , but are more interested in saving money or making money			0
he was removed from the recent school board meeting where the district voted to approve @entity141 's takeover of @entity155 after he spoke without registering			2
" i will die and go to hell before i sit back and let them pull this trick they trying to pull on us , " @entity255 said			0
" they just gon na tell people they gon na give ( @entity141 ) a public school in september ... for what ? " @entity252 , who will enter her senior year in a high school under new management , said she will continue speaking out			0
" i would like for @entity155 to be just left alone the way it is , " she said			0
" we wo n't be silenced			0
