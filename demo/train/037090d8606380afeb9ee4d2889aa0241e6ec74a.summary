-- as a young woman growing up just miles from @entity3 outside of @entity4 , @entity1 was fascinated with aviation			2
it was the early 1940s , and @entity7 had become the first woman to fly solo , nonstop across the @entity9 a decade earlier			0
@entity10 had done it a few years before that			0
" i read every word i could about them and what they did , " said @entity13 , now 93			0
" i wanted to fly			0
" @entity13 got a job so she could pay for flying lessons every saturday			0
in the fall of 1942 , she read in the paper about an experimental program to train female pilots for domestic duty and free up men to fight overseas			1
the 21 - year - old @entity13 was quick to sign up and stood on her tiptoes in order to meet the height requirements			0
she trained from sunup to sundown , seven days a week at @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity34 , to become part of the @entity37 program -- " wasp " for short			1
she later moved to what would become her permanent base , @entity40 outside @entity41 , ferrying military planes all across the country for two years			1
" we would go to the plants or factories or the bases and pick up certain planes and deliver them where they were supposed to go , " she said			2
it was often dirty work			0
" we were oily and covered with sand from flying over the desert			0
" on @entity53 , these pioneering pilots will be celebrated with a float in the 125th @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity57 , part of an effort to bring attention to an often overlooked part of @entity63 history			1
women pilots honored 65 years after @entity66 service first lady @entity67 was an early supporter of the program , writing in a september 1942 newspaper column : " this is not a time when women should be patient			1
we are in a war and we need to fight it with all our ability and every weapon possible			2
women pilots , in this particular case , are a weapon waiting to be used			1
" by 1943 , 25,000 women had applied to join the @entity37 program			1
" these ranged from farm wives in @entity87 to dancers in @entity89 to schoolgirls in @entity57 , " said @entity83 , a history professor at @entity84 who has been studying the program for 20 years			2
" all across the country , women applied to this program			1
" ' everything the men did , we gradually took over ' fewer than 2,000 were chosen for training and just over 1,100 served			1
between 1942 and 1944 , they flew more than 60 million miles in every military aircraft in the arsenal -- bombers , transports and trainer aircraft			1
in addition to ferrying planes , they flew weather flights , chauffeured top military brass around the country , test - flew planes and even towed targets so male pilots could practice shooting them			1
" everything the men did , we gradually took over , " @entity13 said			2
and the men took notice			2
" when we were out ferrying planes , the men would come and see it was a girl and smile and wave , but then they would start doing circles around us			1
" it was a dangerous job			0
@entity13 once had to bail out of her plane when it went into a tailspin over @entity34			0
afterward , she would n't let go of her parachute 's ripcord for hours			0
thirty - eight female pilots were killed while serving their country			1
the program was disbanded with little fanfare in december 1944 , months after a bill to give the women military status failed in @entity140			1
" as the bill was working its way through @entity140 and being much debated through @entity140 , at the same time , you have the armed forces marching through @entity145 towards @entity146 , " @entity83 explained			1
" and at the same time , you have a group of male pilots who are very actively opposing the women becoming part of the military because they want to do the wasp jobs rather than being shipped overseas -- particularly to @entity153 , which is where they were going to be most needed			1
" the very vocal opposition to the plan to officially militarize the @entity37 program , combined with the success of the war in @entity145 , meant the legislation had no chance			1
" the combination of the two was just enough to kill this fairly radical idea of bringing women into the military as pilots , " @entity83 said			1
' we could n't believe it			0
this was our life ' @entity13 and many others were devastated			0
" when we got the word ' you are out of here december 20th , ' we could n't believe it			0
this was our life , " she said			0
" they supplied planes with male pilots to fly us all home , and that was it			2
" not a day goes by that @entity13 does n't think about her time in the air , singing to herself in the cockpit high above the clouds			0
" i enjoyed every minute , " she said			0
" there was nothing like it			0
" it was n't until 1977 that president @entity193 signed legislation -- passed with the help of @entity197 sen. @entity196 -- awarding the wasp military status and making participants eligible for veterans ' benefits			2
in 2010 , the surviving wasp members were awarded the @entity203 in a ceremony at the @entity205			1
inspired in part by a 2010 float honoring the @entity211 , a group of @entity37 participants and supporters raised nearly $ 200,000 to build the @entity55 float to highlight the wartime contributions of these trailblazing women			1
the @entity215 - to - @entity216 , an organization formed to honor the @entity37 , helped spearhead the effort			2
@entity83 is part of the group			2
" these women are being saluted , and i just think it 's a great tribute , " said @entity220 , president of @entity221 , the award - winning company that built the float			2
" i think it 's an important story to tell			0
" the 20 - ton float took more than 2,000 hours to construct and more than twice that time to decorate			0
work was set to continue up until tuesday , attaching pounds of onion , poppy and lettuce seeds , crushed sweet rice and about 35,000 roses			0
there are fewer than 200 wasp participants still living , and the youngest is 89 , @entity83 said			0
on parade day , eight of them from across the country will ride the float , and 20 other female pilots from airlines and the military will walk alongside it			1
" we want the @entity37 to know that the work that they did during the war -- and the work they 've done since in representing women who served as pilots -- that legacy lives on , " she said			1
" their journey may be ending , but their story is n't finished			0

about 1,100 women served in the @entity37 program in @entity66
female pilots ferried military planes around the country to allow men to fight overseas
a bill that would have made the program part of the military failed in @entity140 in 1944
members of the program were awarded @entity203 in 2010
