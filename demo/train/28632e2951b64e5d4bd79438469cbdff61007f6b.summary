-- he is the @entity2 -- and he is hoping to make history of a more notable kind than his predecessor achieved			0
after waiting 27 years to appoint a new manager , @entity7 's attempts to fill the void left by @entity9 now focus on @entity11 -- who on monday was named to succeed @entity13 , sacked in april after enduring a miserable campaign in charge			1
while @entity13 ' short tenure was marked by morale - sapping defeats against lesser teams @entity7 previously brushed aside , @entity16 brings an authority earned by stamping his mark on some of the world 's biggest clubs			1
" it was always a wish for me to work in the @entity31 , " the @entity24 said in a @entity7 statement after a signing a three - year contract with the 20 - time @entity29 champions			1
" to work as a manager for @entity7 , the biggest club in the world , makes me very proud			1
" i have managed in games at @entity35 before and know what an incredible arena @entity35 is and how passionate and knowledgeable the fans are			0
this club has big ambitions ; i too have big ambitions			2
together i 'm sure we will make history			0
" while @entity13 arrived at @entity35 without a major trophy to his name , @entity16 , who will step down from his role as @entity48 coach after the forthcoming @entity49 , comes with real @entity51 pedigree			1
making his name as a manager at @entity54 , he led the @entity24 club to three @entity57 titles , the @entity58 and the @entity59			1
the 62 - year - old enjoyed further success at @entity61 -- winning back - to - back @entity63 titles -- while another @entity57 title followed at @entity65 , before he claimed a @entity67 league - and - cup double at @entity68			1
@entity16 will be expected to take @entity7 back to the summit of @entity29 football after the club slipped from winning the 2012 - 13 @entity31 title by a margin of 11 points to missing out on @entity59 qualification this term , for the first time since 1995			1
" in @entity11 , we have secured the services of one of the outstanding managers in the game today , " declared @entity7 chief executive @entity78			1
" he has achieved many things in his career to date and @entity35 provides him with a fitting stage on which to write new chapters in the @entity7 story			1
" in his bid to restore the club to its former glories , @entity16 has retained @entity92 as his assistant manager			1
the @entity94 is a veteran of over two decades at @entity7 , winning 13 @entity31 titles and two @entity59 crowns in 963 appearances , and took over as manager for the final four games of the 2013 - 14 season after @entity13 was dismissed			1
" i am thrilled to have the chance to serve as assistant manager , " the 40 - year - old said monday , before announcing his retirement from playing			1
" @entity11 is a world - class coach and i know i will learn a lot about coaching from being able to observe and contribute at such close quarters			2
" @entity7 has been a huge part of my life and i 'm delighted to be able to continue that relationship in such a key role			2
" today is a new chapter filled with many emotions -- immense pride , sadness , but most of all , excitement towards the future			0
united fans i hope will share and echo my belief that the club , the management and owners , are doing everything they can to return this great club to where it belongs , and i hope to be there every step of the way			2
" despite @entity16 's impressive track record , his appointment is potentially risky			2
former @entity67 international @entity130 , who worked with the @entity24 during their time together at @entity68 , warned @entity7 players not to expect an easy ride			1
" he 's very strict and severe			0
so the players just have the chance to follow him or they are out , and he takes the next players , " @entity134 recently told @entity136 newspaper @entity135			0
" ( players ) are not computers			0
sometimes the brain is full			0
and he still wants ( you ) to learn , to learn , to learn , high level , every day			0
is it annoying ? no. it 's exhausting			0
that 's what happened at @entity68			0
" although @entity16 impressed during his first stint in charge at @entity61 -- between 1997 - 2000 -- he lasted less than a year in the job upon his return in 2002 , with a string of bad results proving to be his downfall			2
" if you treat your people bad , they remember , " @entity161 chief executive @entity160 , who worked alongside the @entity24 at the @entity162 , told @entity136 's @entity163			2
" one day you make an error and they kill you			0
i 've seen this in many clubs			0
@entity11 has been a very good coach in many clubs but his style is very difficult			1
the same thing happened to him in @entity61 as in @entity68			0
" he is very tough , people do n't like him , but he wins			0
and one day you do n't win -- and when you do n't win , everybody that is angry with you will come back to you and try to kill you			2
" in the movies this works , in real life it does n't			0
" @entity16 , who had been linked with @entity183 until the @entity7 job became available , will be given a large transfer budget as he attempts to bring success back to the club			1
the likes of @entity68 midfielder @entity189 and @entity191 's @entity29 @entity49 defender @entity190 have been linked with moves to @entity193 .			0
