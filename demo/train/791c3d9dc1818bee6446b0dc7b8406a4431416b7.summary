@entity0 , @entity1 -- the eighth day in the trial of a formal spiritual retreat leader charged with manslaughter after a deadly sweat lodge ceremony concluded friday with emotional testimony from the roommate of one of the victims			1
self - help author and @entity12 is accused of three counts of manslaughter in the deaths of three people who were in the sweat lodge for the purification ceremony			1
if convicted , he could face up to 10 years in prison on each count			2
witness @entity21 , who roomed with victim @entity22 during the five - day retreat in 2009 , went through an exhaustive examination friday , recounting all eight rounds of the sweat lodge purification ceremony			1
each round lasted 10 to 15 minutes			2
while they were not prevented from leaving , participants have said they were encouraged to wait until the breaks between rounds			2
@entity21 grew emotional while recalling a horrifying scene after the ceremony ended , describing people tripping over others in their haste to leave the searing hot tent , while others lay unconscious outside			1
" as i was getting ready to leave , there was two gentlemen in front of me who were dragging another lifeless person out			2
one man would pull her arms and another would push			2
... they ( dragged ) her all the way to the door , " she testified			2
she also described seeing her stricken roommate			0
" i was passing @entity22 , and there was some snorting or snoring sounds coming from her , " she said			0
" it was like a gurgling snorting sound			0

prosecutors maintain @entity12 psychologically pressured participants to remain in the lodge even when they were n't feeling well , contributing to the deaths of the three victims			1
the defense has argued the incident was " a tragic accident " and that participants had a free choice to take part in the activities or leave if they became too intense			1
@entity21 , however , testified friday that over the course of the five - day retreat @entity12 instilled a directive among the participants : " play full on			1
" " you learn through the course of the week that you do n't question mr. @entity12 on anything , " @entity21 testified			1
" you know what the rules are -- things are not optional			0
" as you go through the week you learn that there 's consequences or reprimand for you to be called out ... if you question mr. @entity12 or do n't play full on			1
" @entity21 is scheduled to return to the witness stand when the trial resumes tuesday			1
jurors on wednesday heard a recording in which @entity12 previewed the intense ceremony and told participants how it would be a " death and rebirth experience			1
" he told participants it would include the most " intense heat you 've every experienced in your life			0
you will feel like you are going to die			0
" the author described the october 2009 ceremony as a sacred way for participants to rid themselves of " all the things that you 've allowed to be your truth and have caused you to sell yourself short			1
" in the recording , @entity12 told participants , who paid up to $ 10,000 each to attend the event , that as " true spiritual warriors " and in their " altered state " they would endure heat so intense it would make it feel like their skins was coming off of their bodies			1
" i will be right there with you , " he said			0
" you will have to get to a point where you surrender to death , " @entity12 said			1
" when you are going into the lodge symbolically you are going back into the womb of @entity126			0
" " it is such a great metaphor , " the author said			2
" ... my body dies but i never die			0
" prosecutors argue that the lodge -- made of willow trees and branches , and covered with tarpaulins and blankets -- was heated to perilously high temperatures , causing the participants to suffer dehydration and heatstroke			0
during his recorded talk , @entity12 repeatedly told participants to drink plenty of fluids			2
at least 15 others who took part in the ritual fell ill , but more than 40 others were uninjured			0
