@entity0 -- just about a year ago , @entity2 , one of three @entity4 hikers imprisoned in @entity5 on suspicion of espionage , tasted freedom			1
but the road back from an @entity5 jail cell -- where he spent more than two years -- to life in the @entity4 has left the 30 - year - old reflecting about what he and fellow hikers @entity2 and @entity2 had to endure			1
" it 's been quite a year , " said @entity2			1
" i feel way better than a year ago			1
" he said it 's been difficult to recover from his 781 days of imprisonment in an 8 - by - 13 foot jail cell			1
" i 'm feeling really good , but it 's not easy to transition , " he said			2
" a lot of people experience trauma , but mine was very prolonged , systematic , enduring trauma and it 's hard to come out of that			2
" in an interview with @entity1 , @entity2 described how he and @entity2 used to sit in their cell and wonder what it would be like to be free again			1
after he was released on september 21 , 2011 , he said even simple decisions proved daunting			0
" we did n't think it would be as hard as it ( turned out to ) be at all , " he said			0
" now i have the freedom to turn off the light bulb when i sleep			0
i have the freedom to sleep with sheets			0
there 's all sorts of freedom to move i did n't have before			0
" the three @entity4 were hiking in northern @entity45 's mountainous @entity44 region in july 2009 when they were arrested by @entity5 border guards , after apparently straying into @entity5 territory			1
now back in the @entity4 , @entity2 on saturday organized an " occupy " - inspired event in @entity49 , celebrating his one year of freedom			1
next week , @entity5 president @entity51 is to address the @entity52			2
" they 're probably down on 5th @entity56 shopping for some capitalist luxuries , " he said , referring to @entity51 's entourage			0
" and so we want him to bring that stuff to the ' @entity60 , ' " a tongue - in - cheek reference to his anniversary event in @entity0 's @entity64			2
earlier this year , @entity2 traveled to @entity65 , @entity66 , taking advantage of an invitation to toast @entity69 at his 70th birthday party			1
the boxing legend had lobbied on the hikers ' behalf during their imprisonment			0
" i told him how much it uplifted me			0
i told him how buoyant i was when i read ( his ) words , " said @entity2			2
" when i read about the press conference that he gave ... i then immediately put down the letter i was reading ... and started shadow boxing in the room			0
" but the former prisoner also recounted darker times , explaining that the memories of his days and nights spent behind bars still occasionally fill his nightmares			0
" we have n't really had a chance to explain all , " he said , adding that he has plans to publish a tell - all book with his former fellow inmates sometime next year			1
he declined to offer further details about his imprisonment until the book is published .			0
