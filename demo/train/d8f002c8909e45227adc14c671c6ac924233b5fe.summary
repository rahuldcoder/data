-- @entity1 was standing in the @entity2 in a @entity3 about to plunge into water just shy of the freezing point when he came to grips with the challenge he was facing			1
" my most dominant thought as i was standing on the edge of the sea ice , " @entity1 said , " was just how frightened i was			1
the water 's completely black ; there are chunks of white ice in the water			2
" @entity1 said he remembered thinking that if things went wrong , " how long would it take for my frozen body to sink to the bottom of the ocean ? " @entity1 did n't sink , and he completed a one - kilometer swim in 29 - degree fahrenheit ( or -1.7 degree centigrade ) water			1
( since it was salt water it was below the normal freezing point of water			2
) but it came at a price			2
he lost feeling in his hands for four months			2
watch an interview with @entity1 @entity1 , a 40 - year - old former reservist in @entity29 's special forces regiment , the @entity28 , has gained worldwide attention for his extreme adventures , designed to dramatize the environmental threats to the planet			1
whether it 's swimming at the @entity35 , or in a meltwater lake on @entity37 , @entity1 is constantly testing his own limits and calling attention to urgent issues			1
" swimming has been a very effective medium for telling a story about the state of our planet , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
@entity46 : @entity47 skis to the @entity35 the son of an admiral in the @entity29 navy , @entity1 and his family moved to @entity52 when he was 10			1
educated there and at @entity54 , @entity1 became a maritime lawyer but grew dissatisfied with the profession			1
a friend said to him , " @entity1 , if you do n't follow your own dreams in life , then you 're going to be following somebody 's else 's dreams			1
" @entity46 : @entity65 on true success swimming is his dream			1
his adventures have taken him to every ocean and many other bodies of water ; swimming @entity74 's longest fjord , swimming the @entity75 , swimming in the @entity76 in the @entity77 , swimming the full length of the @entity79 , swimming from @entity80 to @entity81			1
" i want to swim until the last day of my life , " @entity1 says			1
@entity1 says he was driven to attempt record - setting coldwater swims because the warm - water swimming challenges had already been conquered			1
he does n't think that his ability to survive cold - water swimming adventures is due to any physical advantage over others , but rather to a resolve never to give up			1
as he was about to dive into the @entity2 , he says , that mental attitude came into play			1
" the most immediate thing you have to do is to just squeeze out the fear , because otherwise the fear will just paralyze you			0
and then commit 100 percent ...			0
i wanted to swim a kilometer across the @entity35			0
and i wanted to do it to demonstrate graphically to the world what was happening in the @entity2 , because the @entity35 should be frozen over			1
@entity46 : @entity100 on running " i remember thinking to myself , if things go bad , i 'll get out after 500 meters ... if you think about a swim like that , that 's the worst way of thinking			0
what you 're doing is confusing your subconscious , because you 're planning for victory and defeat at the same time			0
" so the only way i could get into that water was to get as aggressive as possible -- not wild aggression , controlled aggression -- and to get really focused , and then commit 100 percent to doing the full kilometer and then just dive in , go for it			0
" it took me 18 minutes and 50 seconds , it was just grueling , make no bones about it			0
the human body is not designed for swimming in minus 1.7 degree centigrade water			2
the passengers of the @entity122 perished in water of 5 degrees centigrade			0
so this water is 7 degrees centigrade colder			0
it 's very grueling on the body , and afterward when i came out , my fingers were swollen			0
" we 're made partially of water , so the cells in my fingers had actually frozen and expanded and burst			0
it damaged the nerve cells , it took me four months to feel my fingers again , but now everything 's fine			0
" but the more lasting damage is the psychological impact it has on you because if you have n't felt your hands for four months , you are cautious about going and pushing the boundaries again			2
" yet @entity1 did n't let that stop him			1
in may , two and a half years after the @entity2 swim , he was on @entity37 , swimming in rarefied air at a high altitude			1
" one of the hardest things was to get back in water which was very , very cold , and at 5.5 kilometers above sea level			0
" given the physical damage he suffered after the @entity35 swim , @entity1 says he " had to work hard on putting that swim behind me , forgetting about it , and starting with a fresh clean slate			1
" " it 's almost like when a computer 's got a virus , you clean that hard drive ... that 's what i had to do in my mind , clean my mind			0
" in the @entity28 , the special forces , he said , there is a saying that its initials stand for " speed , aggression , surprise			0
" he adopted that approach in the world of coldwater swimming , swimming as fast as he could , with as much adrenalin as possible , to " fend off the cold			2
" it did n't work in the high - altitude conditions of @entity173			0
" you ca n't bully @entity173			0
@entity37 , it 's very difficult to breathe up there ... so i had to adopt a much calmer approach , one with a lot of humility , and i had to work with the mountain rather than against the mountain			0
" @entity1 swam more slowly , using the breaststroke , and completed the kilometer in just under 23 minutes			1
[ in more normal water conditions , he swims a kilometer in about 14 minutes			0
] @entity1 says his father and mother , who was a nursing officer in the @entity29 navy , set an example of persistence			1
" those people from that generation were not quitters			0
" " i just never , ever want to give up			0
most battles are won in the 11th hour , and most people give up , " he says			0
" if you give up once , it 's quite hard			0
if you give up a second time , it 's a little bit easier			0
give up a third time , it 's starting to become a habit			2
" @entity1 is planning for another epic challenge , but he wo n't say what it will be			1
the only hint he will give is that it will dramatize a threat to another of the world 's major ecosystems			2
" the problem with climate change is that it 's quite complicated for the ordinary person to understand			1
" scientists will constantly refine their work , giving new and varied interpretations of the data , and people may get confused			2
he 's hoping his swims can help : " they 're not confused when they see somebody swimming across the @entity35 , across an open patch of sea			2

swimmer @entity1 uses extreme adventures to dramatize environmental perils
swimming in the @entity2 helped demonstrate impact of climate change , he says
@entity1 says mental *toughness* is the *key* to completing great challenges
once you start giving up , *failure* can become a habit , he says
