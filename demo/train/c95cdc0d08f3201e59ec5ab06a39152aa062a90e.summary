-- regulators this week demanded @entity3 answer , under oath , 107 questions designed to find out when it first knew that some cars contained dangerously faulty ignition switches and what the company did about it			1
a letter this week from the @entity12 to @entity3 follows the company 's decision in recent weeks to recall more than 1.36 million cars over the problem			1
the switches may unintentionally move from the " run " position to the " accessory " or " off " positions , resulting in a loss of power and limiting brakes , steering and airbags			0
@entity3 said it is aware of 31 crashes and 13 deaths that may be linked to the problem in vehicles from the 2003 - 07 model years			1
@entity12 's action comes amid criticism that @entity3 and safety regulators were too slow to initiate a recall after signs of trouble surfaced a decade ago			1
@entity3 last month issued an unusual public apology and executed sizable recalls in two stages			2
it also provided @entity12 with a five - page chronology that began with @entity3 's discovery in 2004 of an incident involving a @entity46 that lost engine power			2
the chronology runs through the beginning of this year			0
but on tuesday , @entity12 asked the company to fill in the blanks			0
it sent @entity3 a letter demanding the manufacturer answer 107 questions by april 3			1
failure to do so would expose @entity3 to a potential $ 35 million fine , the maximum allowed			1
the auto industry and @entity12 , at times , have over the years been accused by advocates of moving too slowly or not aggressively enough to address certain safety concerns			2
the issue came to a head last decade over motorist complaints around unintended acceleration in @entity67 vehicles			0
the @entity69 manufacturer wound up issuing massive recalls , paying record fines , defending itself in huge lawsuits , and overhauling how it deals with @entity75 regulators			1
since that multi-year investigation , the industry has been quicker to identify problems in many cases and issue recalls , and @entity12 has made improvements in how it handles those matters			0
still , not all issues are resolved without controversy			0
in its letter to @entity3 , @entity12 demands a list of documents and records , including engineering drawings , field reports , consumer complaints , lawsuits against @entity3 , and transcripts of deposition testimony by any @entity3 employee , former employee , consultant or expert witness			2
it also seeks internal emails and records about the company 's deliberations about the problem			0
@entity3 spokesman @entity104 said the company has been in contact with @entity12 about the request			2
" we always cooperate and we fully intend to do everything they 're asking by the time they 're asking , " he said			0
" the intent is to comply with their date			0
" @entity3 's new chief executive , @entity116 , has said the company acted " without hesitation " and that it went " well beyond " the recommendation of technical experts			2
but in its chronology , @entity3 said some company engineers knew of the problem with the switch 10 years ago			1
@entity116 said the problems were first brought to the attention of her team " a few weeks ago " and that she led a committee that acted immediately when informed about the problem			0
in the company 's apology , @entity3 @entity131 president @entity130 admitted in a statement last month : " the process employed to examine this phenomenon was not as robust as it should have been			2
" even that acknowledgment is the subject of a @entity12 question -- describe in detail the ways in which @entity3 's process " was not as robust as it should have been " and @entity3 's plans , if any , to change its process			0
" on thursday , former @entity12 administrator and longtime safety advocate @entity146 asked @entity3 to be forthcoming when notifying car owners about a recall			1
" it is imperative that @entity3 's letter to owners be a true safety alert , emphasizing the real possibility of death or severe injury , " she wrote in a letter to the company			1
the recall includes the @entity46 and @entity160 , @entity161 's @entity46 and @entity162 , and @entity164 's @entity163 and @entity165			0
@entity3 said dealers will replace the ignition switch to prevent " unintentional or inadvertent key movement			1
" until that is performed , vehicle owners should use only the ignition key with nothing else on the key ring , @entity3 said			1
@entity175 's @entity174 and @entity176 contributed to this report .			0
