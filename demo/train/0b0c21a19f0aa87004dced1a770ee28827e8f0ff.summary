the @entity5 judges in @entity26 also ordered that her former boyfriend , @entity27 , who was acquitted with her , face a new trial as well over @entity31 's death			2
@entity10 said it had been " painful " to hear the news that the court had ordered a retrial , in a statement issued through the family 's @entity37 spokesman , @entity36			1
timeline : @entity18 murder case the prosecution 's case against her " has been repeatedly revealed to be completely unfounded and unfair , " she said in the statement , and an " objective investigation " and " capable prosecution " are needed if any questions remain about her innocence			2
" the prosecution responsible for the many discrepancies in their work must be made to answer for them , for @entity27 's sake , my sake , and most especially for the sake of @entity18 's family			2
our hearts go out to them , " she said			0
" no matter what happens , my family and i will face this continuing legal battle as we always have , confident in the truth and with our heads held high in the face of wrongful accusations and unreasonable adversity			1
" ' psychological impact ' @entity10 's attorney , @entity68 , earlier told @entity69 that @entity10 was " upset and surprised because we thought that the case was over			1
" but , he added , " at the same time , as she 's done in the last five years , she 's ready to continue and we are ready to fight			2
" @entity68 said he did not expect his client to leave @entity22 for @entity6 " for many reasons , " although she is free to travel			1
experts disagree over extradition for @entity0 " she 's a very young girl and she 's looking to have her life , " he said			1

" there are still so many unanswered questions			1
all we have ever wanted to do is do what we can for @entity18 and to find out the truth of what happened that night			0
" @entity18 's conviction was on the basis that there was more than one person there so that is something that needs to be looked into			0
" the @entity118 ' family lawyer , @entity117 , earlier said they wanted a retrial because they believed the ruling that acquitted @entity10 and @entity27 was " superficial and unbalanced			1
" @entity0 : fascination with ' the evil female ' judge @entity123 told the court he would publish the reasoning behind his decision within 90 days , after which the parties would have 45 days to present their case			1
the retrial is not expected until sometime early next year , to be heard in an appellate court in @entity132			0
after that , both parties would again be able to appeal at the @entity5			0
@entity135 , a law lecturer at @entity136 and an expert on the @entity6 legal system , said that the judges ' decision to order a retrial is " not unusual when a case is very complex and there is a clear contrast between different accounts of the factual scenario			1
" while the @entity6 @entity5 decides on points of law , the boundaries are not always clear , @entity135 said			0
" in this specific trial , the use and interpretation of evidence was discussed , " but the picture should become clearer when the full reasons for the court 's ruling are issued in the coming weeks , he said			0
@entity10 may be ordered to return to @entity6 for the retrial			1
if she refuses , the @entity6 government could appeal to the @entity1 government for her extradition			0
but even if it does , @entity10 might still not end up before an @entity6 court			1
double jeopardy ? @entity1 officials might reject such a request because it violates the @entity1 legal principle that a criminal defendant ca n't be tried twice on the same allegation , said @entity171 , a contributor for @entity173 's " @entity174			0
" @entity6 lacks the absolute prohibition present in @entity1 law preventing authorities from retrying a criminal defendant who has been acquitted of a charge			0
2011 : was @entity6 fair to @entity0 ? " we have principles that are well - founded within our @entity182 , one of which is double jeopardy , " @entity171 said			1
" so as a result of that , i think it would be highly objectionable for the @entity1 to surrender someone to another country for which justice has already been administered and meted out			0
so i do n't think or anticipate that that would happen			0
" another lawyer for @entity10 , @entity194 , said monday that her client was confident in the @entity6 legal system and hoped one day to return to @entity6 as a free woman			1
