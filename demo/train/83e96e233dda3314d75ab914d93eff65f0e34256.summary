-- popular literature would have it that the vampire 's preferred habitat is @entity5 ( or , if you 're under 15 , the slightly less glamorous forks , @entity8 )			0
but modern day vampire hunters might better focus their attention on a little - known area of northwestern @entity12 , where earlier this month a suspected vampire grave was exhumed			1
@entity14 , who led the dig at a marketplace in the small @entity18 town of @entity19 , told local website kamienskie.info that several unusual aspects of the burial " indicate that it is a vampire burial "			2
teeth had been removed , a fragment of rock was inserted in the mouth , and a leg had been staked ( presumably to prevent the body rising from the grave )			0
and this is n't the first time an interment in @entity12 has been deemed vampiric			1
last july , archaeologists uncovered four decapitated skeletons , their heads placed between their legs , at a construction site in @entity39 , southern @entity12			1
both the @entity39 and @entity19 graves are estimated to date back to the 16th century			0
the burials may sound gruesome , but they are befitting of early medieval @entity12 folklore 's particularly grisly interpretation of the vampire myth			1
" specific to @entity12 vampires is that they are known for eating their own flesh and burial garments when they rise from the dead , " says @entity45 , who convenes a course on vampires for the @entity48 at @entity49			1
he adds that this may explain the stone placed in the mouth of the skeleton			2
fear of vampires was strong among @entity61 in the medieval period			1
professor @entity63 , a colleague of @entity64 's , posits the folk tales spread from @entity66 to surrounding countries following a report sent by @entity70 military authorities to their superiors in @entity72			0
it told of a mercenary soldier who had been turned into a vampire and infected his victims , who when exhumed from their own graves were found to have fresh blood in their cavities			2
the report was intercepted before reaching the @entity70 capital and published in newspapers			0
the @entity12 had particular reason to fear vampires rising from their graves , @entity45 explains			1
" according to some sources , @entity12 thought that vampires were born , rather than ' made ' , " he says			1
" they were normal people who could live normal lives , not aristocrats living in distant castles			0
the problems only started when these people died			0
they could come back to live with their families and even impregnate their wives			0
" this may account for the precautions taken during burial			2
@entity45 adds the notion of vampires being creatures of the night only appeared relatively recently in the 1922 film " @entity101 "			2
however , some experts warn against presuming all such unconventional burials were because of a fear of vampires			1
@entity106 , an archaeologist with the @entity107 in @entity108 , northern @entity12 , admits a number of strange medieval mortuary practices have been discovered during digs in @entity12 , the most common being those where the body is in the prone position , decapitated , or covered with stones			1
but the idea is these burials may just as well represent punishment for criminals rather than suspected vampires			2
that said , @entity106 concedes the most recent discovery " is certainly unusual "			0
" the pierced thigh - bone and a stone inside the mouth clearly indicate that a range of atypical practices with ritual undertones were performed , " he says			2
" ( the stone ) might reflect the desire to create some kind of supernatural ' barrier ' between the dead and the world of the living			0
" such peculiar last rites are not confined to medieval @entity12			1
@entity106 says the last recorded instance of this kind of deviant burial was in 1913			2
as with the skeletons found in @entity39 last year , the head had been cut off and placed by the legs			0
" perhaps such a placement of the head ensured the dead would not be able to ' reach it ' and put it back on his neck , " he suggests			0
vampiric or not , the strange range of historical graves in @entity12 indicate the country held deep beliefs around the ritualistic burial of certain citizens			1
@entity155 , from the @entity156 at the @entity157 , is currently working on a research project into the phenomenon			0
" unusual mortuary practices have fascinated @entity12 scholars since the 1950s ( when the first were discovered ) , " she says			1
" but so far they remain unknown to a wider international audience			0
it is high time to change this			0
