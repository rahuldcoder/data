-- a lifetime may be too short to recover from the loss of a child , let alone just a year			2
@entity6 shot dead her 6 - year - old son , @entity7			1
her wounds are still raw			0
and the release wednesday of the 911 calls to police after @entity6 charged into @entity12 with an assault rifle was like rubbing salt on those wounds			1
" i have no desire whatsoever to hear the slaughter of 26 people , including my 6 - year - old boy			1
and i ca n't imagine why anyone else would want to hear that as well , " @entity4 told @entity0			1
she absolutely did not want a judge to release the recordings of the december 14 massacre in @entity25 , @entity26 , that claimed the lives of 20 first - graders and six teachers			1
after the release , media organizations struggled with how to handle the material			1
some news outlets , including @entity0 , opted to air portions of the recordings , including a 911 call from a school secretary , one from a teacher and one from a janitor			1
other news organizations decided not to use any of the material directly , instead describing some of the recordings in news coverage without airing or posting any of the contents			1
@entity4 says she 'll do her best to avoid hearing the voices describing the horror of that day , of gunfire popping in the background			1
but she 's afraid of happenstance			0
" i do n't know if i 'm going to turn on the radio one day , or turn on the tv one day , or be googling on something and just happen to come across them by accident , " @entity4 said			1
bringing back memories parents of the murdered students were able to leverage the law to prevent the release of the crime scene photos from that day			1
but some of them are upset they could n't hold back the 911 recordings			1
the @entity65 had requested they be made public in accordance with the @entity67			1
scenes of grieving parents on the day of the shooting are still vivid in the mind of sen. @entity72 of @entity26			1
now that the call recordings are out , he 's concerned about the pain they 'll cause			1
" i think the tapes bring back those memories , " he said			0
but the appeals judge , who upheld the decision to release them , did n't really have a choice , he said			1
judge @entity83 was afraid that holding them back would " fuel speculation about and undermine confidence in our law enforcement officials			0
" the good in the bad @entity90 , who lost her mother to @entity6 's bullets , agrees with @entity83 's decision -- despite her personal anguish			1
@entity90 's mother , @entity96 , was the school principal			0
she was confronting @entity6 when he gunned her down			0
@entity90 believes that knowing is better than not knowing			0
the calls belong to the @entity99 public , she said			1
and they can help the country deal with future shootings			0
" they do n't belong to the victims ' families , painful as they may be , and there is nothing on the recordings that violates the victims ' privacy , " @entity90 said			1
" the public has the right to know			2
" psychologists divided psychologists were divided on how to handle the calls			2
@entity116 frowns on their release , particularly the effect they might have on children who hear them			2
" there are computers everywhere			0
even if you have parental control , kids can get past that and listen to these tapes themselves , " she told @entity0 's @entity125			0
she fears the exposure will trigger post-traumatic stress disorder , even in people who have no connection to the school or its community			2
but clinical psychologist @entity137 believes that the pain of reliving those moments will help people process the trauma			0
" i think listening to these tapes , of course , will open old wounds			0
but sometimes you do have to open them in order to clean them out			0
" @entity148 purposely used the recordings to reopen his own			2
" i had felt it was something that i needed to do , that i wanted to do , " he said			0
i brought him into the world			0
" @entity152 died at @entity6 's hands			0
" you can only try to imagine what it 's like to lose a child , " @entity148 said			0
" and unless you 've lost a child , you ca n't imagine			2
the best description i can give is it 's like losing a leg and an arm ... and not being able to hold yourself up or support yourself			2
" @entity148 got to spend just six short years with his son before @entity167 was lowered into the ground			2
and this holiday season will be especially tough for his family			2
@entity148 plans to take down a christmas tree he set up with @entity152 after @entity171 last year			0
they planned to decorate it in a few days			0
@entity0 's @entity175 and @entity176 contributed to this report .			0
