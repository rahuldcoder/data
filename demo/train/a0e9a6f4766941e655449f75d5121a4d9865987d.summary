it is rare for women and men in @entity3 to enjoy the thrill of sports together in public , but it happened over the weekend when several restaurants and cafes appeared to ignore a ban on broadcasting the @entity11			1
inside one @entity14 coffee shop , a young , veiled @entity3 woman held her fianc√© 's hand tightly as the seconds ticked down in @entity3 's heart - stopping @entity11 match against @entity21 powerhouse @entity20			1
another woman gently bit her @entity24 - manicured nails as she sat between two male friends who were drenched with nervous sweat and fast losing their voices			2
throughout the rest of the cafe other women intermittently cheered , gasped , and shouted instructions at the direction of the big screen tv			2
" 100 percent it 's better this way , " said @entity34			2
" it does n't happen often			0
it would be great if we have more of this			0
" " it 's actually much better to watch it with a bunch of people around because it makes you feel more excited , " said @entity41			0
authorities in @entity3 banned women from entering most sporting events following the @entity51 because mixed crowds enjoying games was deemed un-islamic			1
for the past 35 years , the crowds at football games -- @entity3 's most popular sport -- have been all male			2
@entity3 women were briefly allowed to attend volleyball matches during the presidency of moderate @entity61 but the ban was reinstated in 2005 when @entity63 came to power			1
in an apparent effort to avoid mixed crowds watching this year 's @entity11 , authorities warned restaurants not to broadcast games			1
" we were told not to turn on the tv because it might create some problems , " a restaurant hostess told @entity70 on the phone			0
in more subtle measures designed to deter mixed crowds , women do n't appear on @entity11 billboards throughout @entity14 , and state tv uses a delay of several seconds during matches to censor images of female fans deemed too racy for viewers			1
but in a country where conservative social norms often clash with a young , defiant , fun - loving population , women have continued to demand equality			2
earlier this month , several @entity3 women snuck into a men 's volleyball match in @entity14 disguised as @entity95 fans , state media reported			1
others protested outside the match			0
" we have rights too			0
we should be able to go to games , " said @entity34			0
" they 're taking our rights , " said @entity41			0
" it 's our right to watch our teams			0
" this month state media reported that female vice president @entity106 was " investigating " the ban on women attending volleyball matches -- a sign perhaps that @entity3 's moderate president @entity111 is heeding @entity3 women 's demand for equal rights to enjoy sports .			1

women defy ban on watching sports with men to cheer on @entity3 in @entity11
@entity122 was introduced after @entity51 ; mixed crowds deemed un-islamic
women continue to fight for equality
