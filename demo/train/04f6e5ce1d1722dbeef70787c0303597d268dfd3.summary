a moment of truth approaches for president @entity3 's signature health care reforms with saturday 's self - imposed deadline to get the website to work properly for most users			1
@entity3 and officials in charge of @entity9 say the " vast majority " of people who go to the website to sign up at the end of the month will have a much improved experience than the crashes , error messages and delays users faced when it launched october 1			1
however , problems continue to plague the system , and technology experts question if the fixes being deployed by a team of government workers , outside contractors and specialists can get it functioning smoothly as soon as saturday			1
@entity27 , president of @entity30 - based software developer @entity28 , called the administration 's prediction that @entity9 would work at 80 % capacity on or around november 30 an impractical threshold in the software world			1
" i do n't know how to build something that 's only 80 % complete , " @entity27 told @entity36			2
" i do n't even understand how that works			2
" the website woes raised questions about the viability and security of the system , and opened the reforms known as @entity45 to fresh attacks by conservative republicans who seek to dismantle or eliminate them			0
more bad news emerged wednesday when the administration announced the website will be unable to enroll small businesses online for another year			1
@entity53 : enroll in @entity45 , but not too fast small businesses can enroll in other ways in the special small business system known as @entity57 , but problems with @entity9 have prevented their online enrollment so far			1
it was the third delay of the @entity62 component of the website , this time until november 2014			0
for now , " small businesses will be able to enroll directly in a shop plan through an insurer , agent or broker and can get certified for a tax credit after they enroll , " said @entity64 , a spokeswoman for the @entity65 that oversees the rollout of the reforms			1
the @entity76 does n't require companies with fewer than 50 employees to buy insurance for workers , though workers are required to have coverage			0
employers who choose to provide coverage for their workers may qualify for subsidies to reduce their costs			0
" we expect that making direct enrollment , tax credit applications and comparison shopping easier will help to ensure that small businesses can take full advantage of the marketplace and tax credits worth up to 50 % of employee premiums in 2014 , " @entity64 said			1
however , the head of the @entity98 complained the delay in online enrollment made it harder for small business owners to get all the information they need to enroll			1
" with this delay , it will also call into question how the small business tax credit is applied , " said @entity104 , the group 's president and ceo			2
" not having the ability to apply electronically will now make this process more confusing , cumbersome and time - consuming for employers			0
" republicans pounced on the news , with @entity53 speaker @entity116 urging @entity3 to delay implementation of the entire @entity76			0
" this law has been an absolute disaster , leaving us to ask , ' what 's next ? ' " the @entity119 @entity118 said in a statement			0
" if the president wo n't repeal it , he should at least delay the entire law before it wreaks any more havoc on @entity131 families and small businesses as well as our economy			1
" @entity116 signs up for @entity45 meanwhile , insurance industry insiders told @entity36 on condition of not being identified that problems continue with the transmission of data submitted by people signing up for coverage through @entity9			1
" there 's no part of us that thinks all of this will be fixed in three days from now , " an industry official said , referring to the november 30 date for the site to run smoothly for most users			1
@entity148 , a spokesman for the insurance trade group @entity149 , said that " there is still a lot of work to be done to make sure that enrollments can be done and processed accurately			0
" insurers : despite deadline , @entity45 glitches persist wednesday 's developments came as the @entity3 administration prepared for a potential surge in online enrollment over the weekend			1
according to a @entity53 official , the administration suggested this week that allied organizations hold off on launching campaigns to drive traffic to the website in the first week of december			1
officials fear another huge surge in volume that the site ca n't handle , which is what occurred around its launch in october			1
@entity9 was originally planned to handle 50,000 concurrent users , and will reach that capacity by saturday , the @entity53 official said			1
however , big spikes in traffic -- such as the 200,000 who tried to get on at the same time on october 1 -- would cause users to go into a queue to receive e-mails advising them when to return , the official noted			2
publicly , @entity3 and @entity182 secretary @entity181 have been urging @entity131 to give @entity9 another try , though they make clear it remains a work in progress			1
the november 30 target for website improvements " does not represent a relaunch of @entity9 ; it is not a magical date , " @entity64 told reporters			1
" there will be times after november 30 when @entity9 does not function properly			2
" website woes aside , a new @entity36 / @entity194 poll released wednesday showed a majority of @entity131 believe the current @entity45 problems can be solved , and the figures for overall support and opposition remain little changed from a month ago			2
in a conference call tuesday with state and local officials , @entity181 listed steps taken so far to improve the website 's performance			1
" we 've added hardware , we 've added software ; we 're continuing to work on the parts of the website that were too confusing to people , " she said , urging the officials " to not hesitate to recommend that people go to @entity9 and get signed up because that experience is currently working much better and it will continue to work much better			1
" @entity181 : @entity45 website improvements ' on track ' a properly functioning website is crucial to implementing the most vital provisions of the @entity76 that require people to have health coverage			0
the failure of @entity9 to enable people to enroll when the sign - up period began last month undermined the launch of new health insurance exchanges intended to provide affordable coverage for millions who previously were uninsured or under - insured			2
in theory , the exchanges create large pools of customers that include generally healthier and less - costly younger people as well as older folks who tend to require more expensive health care			0
such large markets would hold down prices by allowing insurance companies to offset the higher costs of aging consumers with the money from lower - cost policy holders , the thinking goes			0
for the program to work , it needs to sign up younger people less inclined to pay for health coverage they do n't believe they need			2
the @entity118 opposition targets the entire health care law , not just the website woes , as the ultimate example of big government run amok			0
enrollment figures for the first month after the opening of the new insurance exchanges were much lower than initially expected			0
now some states have reported stronger numbers			0
according to a @entity36 count based on available figures , a little more than 200,000 people have signed up for new private health insurance under @entity45 -- either through the national system or networks set up in 14 states and the @entity264			0
in addition , more than 370,000 have signed up for @entity266 under state programs expanded through the health care reforms , the @entity36 count shows			0
the enrollment period runs until march 31 , and officials have said the target for the first year was 7 million people			2
to ensure they have coverage starting on january 1 , consumers must sign up by december 23 , the administration recently announced			0
@entity27 , the software expert , cited december 23 as the most significant deadline , noting that demand would be huge because people by nature wait until the last minute			2
success for the website would be determined by both the number of users as well as how long they are in the system , @entity27 said , comparing it to a highway on which 50,000 people traveling 60 mph is smooth traffic while the same number going 10 mph is a jam			1
also wednesday , seven @entity294 senators , including some up for re-election next year , asked @entity3 to appoint a special health care overseer to ensure continuity in efforts to fix the problems			2
@entity181 is technically the top administration official in the implementation of @entity45 , but former @entity53 aide @entity301 was brought in last month to oversee efforts to fix the site			0
@entity304 will become a top economic adviser to @entity3 in january			0
in a letter , sens. @entity306 of @entity307 , @entity308 of @entity309 , @entity310 of @entity30 , @entity311 of @entity312 , @entity313 of @entity314 , @entity315 of @entity316 and @entity317 of @entity30 called for @entity3 to name a successor to @entity301			0
separately , an @entity182 official confirmed the government will go with a new web - hosting contractor , @entity323 , for @entity9 early next year			2
the current contract with @entity325 ends in march			0
the official said the decision to go with a different vendor was made months before any problems with @entity9 were identified and was unrelated to an outage that struck the site in late october , which the administration blamed on the @entity335 subsidiary			1
the @entity323 contract was signed in july			0
@entity337 to take up @entity45 contraception case @entity36 analysis : no @entity45 subsidy for some @entity45 site 's @entity341 shelved @entity45 playbook : spread negative perception			0

saturday is the administration 's deadline for @entity9 to work for most users
officials say the website will work better but warn that some problems will persist
