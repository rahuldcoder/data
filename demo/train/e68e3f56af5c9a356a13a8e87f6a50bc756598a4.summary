-- on tuesday , an @entity2 soldier killed a @entity4 major general and wounded a @entity6 brigadier general , as well as up to 15 others , in an attack at the @entity9 in the @entity2 capital , @entity11			1
the attack is an ominous sign regarding the potential risks to @entity4 service members as the majority of @entity4 forces withdraw from @entity2			1
if a @entity18 between the @entity4 and @entity2 is signed in coming months , the @entity4 is likely to keep a residual force of around 9,800 troops in @entity2 after the withdrawal of all @entity4 combat troops at the end of 2014			1
this residual force would serve in an advisory role to @entity2 troops , which could further expose @entity4 forces to insider attacks			1
officials identified the @entity4 who was killed as maj. gen. @entity32			0
rear adm. @entity33 , the @entity34 spokesman , said the @entity2 soldier who carried out the attack was shot and killed			1
although directed at high - ranking officers , it was far from the first insider attack on coalition troops in @entity2			2
according to a count by the @entity42 , there have been 82 such attacks on coalition personnel over the course of the @entity46			0
the numbers refer to @entity2 police and army members attacking @entity51 troops			0
during the early years of the war , there were very few insider attacks			0
but they took off in 2011			0
that year , the number rose to 14 , followed by a peak of 40 in 2012			0
at least 145 @entity4 and other @entity51 soldiers have been killed by @entity2 soldiers , according to @entity61 's data			2
so far , in 2014 there have been only three such attacks , including tuesday 's in @entity11 , and an attack on june 23 in @entity65 , @entity66 , where two @entity4 military advisers were injured in a shooting by an @entity2 police officer			1
before that , on february 12 , two @entity4 @entity71 members were killed in @entity2 's @entity74 province by gunmen wearing @entity77 uniforms			2
in april 2011 , in an attack that killed the most coalition personnel , an @entity2 military pilot killed eight @entity4 soldiers and a military contractor during a meeting in the operations room of the @entity85 at @entity86			2
insider attacks have taken their largest toll on troops from the @entity4 , which contributes the largest contingent of forces to operations in @entity2 military members from @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity6 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and the @entity102 have also been targets			1
still , the number of deaths in insider attacks on foreign forces has been declining -- although they spiked in 2012 , when 59 coalition members were killed			0
in 2011 , there were 36 ; in 2013 , there were 18			0
the @entity4 took several steps after insider attacks became a large - scale problem , including improving vetting of @entity2 security personnel and putting more counterintelligence assets into the field to try to detect threats			2
@entity33 downplayed the significance of tuesday 's attacks , asserting that he has " seen no indication that there 's a degradation of trust between coalition members and their @entity2 counterparts			0
" maintaining that trust as @entity4 combat troops withdraw will be key .			1
