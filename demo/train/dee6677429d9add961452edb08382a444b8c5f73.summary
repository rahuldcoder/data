-- @entity1 recently released its annual 5 in 5 list , in which the technology company tries to predict emerging trends and technologies that will transform our lives over the next five years			1
no. 4 on this year 's list concerned mobile technology			1
specifically , @entity1 says that , thanks to mobile technology , the digital divide will soon cease to exist			1
in a video , @entity1 put it this way : " in our global society , the wealth of economies are decided by the level of access to information			2
and in five years , the gap between information haves and have - nots will cease to exist due to the advent of mobile technology			1
" the digital divide ( a term that refers to the gap between people who do and do n't have high - speed internet access ) is an increasingly important issue for the nation , the economy and the world			1
without internet access , it 's getting harder to apply for jobs , get an education , stay in touch with friends and family -- and keep up with news that affects your life			2
still , it will probably take much longer than five years -- if ever -- for significant inequities in access to digital information and services to disappear entirely			2
the digital divide may look quite different in five years , but it will probably still be with us			1
here 's why : mobile phones can help close the digital divide , but using the internet on a phone has some drawbacks			1
that 's a point @entity59 makes in an upcoming report on the digital divide for the @entity62			1
" mobile internet users experience the internet differently because they have a small screen and often slower data connections			0
but they tend to always have their device with them -- which means they can constant access to information , " she said			0
" so mobile net users might not be able to engage with certain online services as easily as they could on a laptop computer , but they do have more ubiquitous access			2
" according to @entity62 , once consumers acquired a wireless device , they start using the @entity64 more actively -- especially to connect with others			0
people go online from their phones not just to get information , but to share and create -- even more than before			0
@entity62 also found that a substantial portion of @entity87 adults are choosing smartphones over computers for internet access			0
young adults ( aged 18 - 29 ) , blacks and @entity93 , people who never attended college , and those with an annual household income of less than $ 30,000 are not only more likely than the average @entity87 to use smartphones -- they 're also especially likely use their phone as their main way to get online			0
furthermore , about a third of @entity87 who mostly go online from their phones do n't have high - speed broadband internet access at home			0
then there 's the problem of who does or does not have high - speed internet access			2
what constitutes " fast enough " online access is a moving target as technology and online services evolve			2
as i wrote earlier , even in developed nations like the @entity87 , not everyone with a mobile device will have access to -- or more importantly , be able to afford -- robust mobile devices and fast ( 4g speeds or above ) wireless data networks			1
a couple of years ago @entity121 qualified as " wireless broadband , " but as @entity87 carriers roll out faster 4g networks , increasingly having only @entity116 may leave you on the wrong side of the digital divide			1
in order to get faster 4g network access on your mobile device , you 'll need a 4g compatible phone and a 4g data plan			2
these cost consumers more than simpler handsets and slower networks			0
however , @entity137 , @entity1 's chief technology officer for telco research , did note a few intriguing mobile trends that could help lessen the digital divide in the next five years			1
one of these is " peer - to - peer access " -- in which mobile devices can connect directly with each other , rather than though cable or phone companies			1
this could provide more internet access to more people , at least within a fairly small geographic location			0
" if you have bandwidth that you 're not using , someone else who needs additional bandwidth communicates with you to get that additional access , " wrote @entity137			0
in addition to redistributing existing internet access , peer - to - peer networking technologies ( such as near field communications or @entity161 ) can allow people to set up their own local independent miniature @entity64 -- a technique called " mesh networking			0
" earlier this year protesters in @entity165 set up mesh networks to get around government - imposed blackouts of @entity64 and phone access			0
@entity137 also noted the growing role of " machine - to - machine communications , " which could allow cell phones and other mobile devices to connect people to useful services			1
" people wo n't initiate communication for information , " he predicted			0
" for example , your mobile phone will have access to your electronic health care records while also monitoring your vitals , such as blood pressure , in real time			2
a system could notify and connect you to a doctor if your blood pressure is out of a normal range			0
" in the next five years we will undoubtedly see lots more wearable mobile devices ( such as the new @entity192 health monitor ) and communication - enabled " smarter objects " in our environment ( such as smart appliances )			1
over time , these extra points of data and communication will also interact with phones ( even simpler , cheaper phones ) to play some role in diminishing the digital divide			1
but we wo n't get there in five short years			0
the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity206 .			0

@entity1 says mobile technology will close the digital divide
even in rich nations , however , not everyone will have access to robust mobile devices
@entity1 's prediction of the *demise* of the digital divide is silent on affordability
