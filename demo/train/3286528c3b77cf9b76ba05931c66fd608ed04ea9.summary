-- for most designers , good design is neither just a well - functioning object nor a good - looking object , but rather both			2
i say both , as the simultaneity is crucial so that function and appearance support each other and , when done well , in a sense become indistinguishable			0
in designing products , we consider these two attributes -- along with other factors such as budget , material capability and consumer response -- and add them to the mixture that constitutes design			2
what @entity20 did was to add yet another element : innovative marketing			1
have you ever been in an @entity24 that is n't packed with people " just browsing ? " they are there to soak up whatever @entity28 is and does			0
who would ever have thought that bulky , wooden @entity31 tables would be enough ? but you can bet on one thing : @entity20 did not go to market research groups to find the answer			1
he knew that all each store would need , beyond its terrific merchandise , were bare essentials			0
think about it : he did n't need flashing neon , he did n't need hip tunes blaring so that you could n't hear each other , he did n't need wild colors or expensive materials			0
he simply needed a clean space with a sales force of people , each wearing an @entity28 t - shirt			1
i gasp whenever i see , in a newspaper or magazine , a new restaurant where the designer has opted for outrage in his or her need to be the next cutting - edge idea , forgetting that the customer might just want a good place to eat with friends			1
i imagine that @entity20 would not have had a hand in that type of scenario			1
he might simply have said , " it 's not that difficult			2
after all , it 's just about dinner			0
" share your memories of @entity20 designers often neglect the essence of innovation when they are overwhelmed with the requirements of the product they are designing			1
the @entity24 design , the product design , the hardware design and software design all come down to innovation -- something not tried before			0
i am reminded of an apocryphal story about @entity83			0
two frumpy ladies were standing in front of a cubist portrait of @entity87 , or at least the label said " @entity87			0
" one woman turned to her friend and said , " it does n't look like @entity87			0
" @entity92 , who happened to be standing behind them , said in a prophetic tone , " it will			0
" in a commencement address to @entity98 graduates that 's been widely televised since his death , @entity20 revealed something about himself that i , too , have felt intensely since i suffered paralysis			1
of course , being aware that his illness would limit his time , he said that he wanted every day to be spent making a contribution			1
one imagines that @entity20 , given how much he loved doing what he did , wanted to leave this world exhausted from his passion for his life 's work , for that 's all that would give him rest			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity117 .			2

designer @entity117 says @entity20 added innovation to the designer 's tool *kit*
he says @entity20 recognized clean , well - *staffed* stores were all that was needed to show products
@entity20 was aware illness would limit his time , wanted each day to make a contribution , he says
@entity117 : @entity20 wanted to leave this world exhausted from his passion for his life 's work
