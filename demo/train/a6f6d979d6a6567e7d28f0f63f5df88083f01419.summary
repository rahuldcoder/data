@entity0 -- without the star attraction on wednesday , this might have just been another fashion show at @entity4			1
there were whispers and rumors that the designer 's muse would make an appearance , but no one was certain			2
we were also in the dark			0
we knew that @entity14 would be strutting down the catwalk as part of @entity18 's womenswear show for @entity19 ( of @entity21 fame ) , but we were n't sure if @entity14 would turn up for an interview with @entity1			1
for 24 hours , her people who were in touch with our people could not confirm if the interview would actually go ahead , but they encouraged us to come to @entity0 anyway to see the catwalk show			1
it was n't your average fashion show			1
for one , it was in a basketball gym			0
the basketball hoops were carefully hidden from view , and the set clearly overtook the space			0
scores of gothic arches lined the runway with dozens of photographers marking the foot of the catwalk			0
this made for a striking alternative to just a white walkway for the crowd , but for the scrum of photographers poised at the foot of the runway , this could n't have been worse			0
it seemed no one could get a really clear image of the show or the models as they strutted down the catwalk			2
one photographer said it was hard enough not getting enough space to work in ( photographers are usually given little more than the width of their shoulders to set up camp for the show ) , but it was something else not being able to see the proverbial wood from the trees ( full disclosure : the gothic columns were made of wood )			2
another was so angry that he would n't be able to sell any of the footage as he said none of it was useable			0
but theatrical it was , and @entity14 would n't have it any other way			1
speakers blasted her latest single , " @entity89 , " as the superstar strutted down the catwalk amidst the models			0
the models themselves were interesting			0
there was a model with his whole shaved head tattooed -- a skull and a brain			0
he apparently has a starring role in @entity14 's " @entity89 " video			1
then there were the shoes			0
some of them were as high as 15 inches ( platform of course )			0
it was an extreme runway with some justification as the models teetered tentatively down the end of catwalk			0
i remember staring at my own 6 - inch heels and wondered what i was complaining about as i walked slowly around the show			1
as for the clothes , i was expecting a lot of leather and pvc -- your average gothic look			0
i was pleasantly surprised to see some pieces i would wear : gorgeous slinky dresses and yes , even the @entity119 high - waisted pencil skirt			2
my producer , @entity125 , tried to stay in the shadows so no one would notice his ( in his own words ) " $ 5 brown corduroy jacket bought from a @entity131 market			0
" when the lady herself emerged puffing a cigarette , clad in a black bra , black hat , black pvc trousers and very high black knee - high boots , sections of the crowd whooped with delight			1
what you have to know about fashion shows , especially during @entity4 , is that this is the time for buyers and fashion editors to see the newest collection so it is n't just about the entertainment factor			1
anyway , back to the @entity14 show			1
while the set was lit up , the darkness in the crowd was lit by the multitude of led lights from the many mobile phones capturing every moment			0
then just 12 minutes later , the show ended and the crowd slowly exited the gym			2
however , we went against the tide ( me in my 6 - inch heels ) and made our way backstage			1
our contact negotiated with the burly bodyguards to let us through to the other side , where we walked up stairs , across bleachers ( me trying not to trip over the miles of lighting cables ) to where our second cameraman had set up lights and cameras			0
this is where the interview with @entity14 and @entity18 would take place -- if it would take place at all			1
to be fair , when this whole interview opportunity first came up , we were told it would take place after the show at 11 p.m. local time			1
then when we got to our spot , we were told @entity14 would show up in an hour			1
then it was 15 minutes and then it was half an hour			0
true to their word , 30 minutes later there was a flurry of activity below us , and we saw the singer and her stylist weaving their way through the crowds taking their plaudits from those who were part of the show as they sipped champagne			2
when @entity14 approached , she was in good spirits			1
she introduced herself as @entity14 , and she was excited for her friend @entity202 -- he was the man behind the infamous meat dress			1
in fact , one of the first things she said was she did n't want to take any credit for the show or for the collection			2
although she did say she had bought the lot			0
for @entity14 , this was a night not about her but about the man who helped create her image and look			1
throughout the interview , she embraced and kissed him			2
she looked at him lovingly , and they acted like friends in a playground			0
for his part , he seemed shy , grateful for the applause , but very much taking his cue from his famous friend			0
the interview went well -- after all , we were talking about the brand ( both @entity19 and @entity14 ) -- until i asked about @entity229 , who was ousted from @entity230 after reportedly making anti-semitic remarks			1
designer @entity229 apologizes this was the biggest news during @entity4 , and people were commenting and reacting			1
but when i asked the question if they had any reaction to the scandal , you could almost hear a pin drop			0
@entity14 quickly looked at her publicist and said she did n't want to comment			1
rather , she said , she wanted " to keep it positive			0
" after a few more questions about marketing and business , i commented on her shoes as i wanted to know how she was able to walk in her very high platform shoes , which by the way have no heels			2
they were high platforms that basically look like she 's on her tiptoes			2
i asked because i was embarrassed to admit i was walking very carefully in my heels			2
both @entity14 and @entity18 immediately knew the make of my shoes ( @entity256 ) and we bonded			1
the interview came to an end			2
we took some photographs , and i left for the bureau to edit the piece			0
we waited for this for over a day , and it was over in 10 minutes			1
i thought she was nice and personable but very careful in what she said			0
it 's not every day i get to interview a megastar , and you could n't get any bigger than @entity14 these days .			1

@entity1 's @entity273 is at @entity4
clad in her own 6 - inch heels , @entity276 races to her interview with @entity14
she waited over a day for a 10 - minute interview
the *results* : pure @entity285 bliss at the fashion show
