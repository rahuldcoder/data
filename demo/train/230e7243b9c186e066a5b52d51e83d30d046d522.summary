dr. @entity0 answered a calling			1
that 's what friends and colleagues say about the man who garnered national headlines when he became the first known ebola hemorrhagic fever patient in the @entity9			1
@entity0 , 33 , arrived saturday in @entity10 from @entity11 , where he and another @entity9 missionary worker contracted the deadly virus while caring for @entity15 patients			1
from an early age , @entity0 was driven by his faith in @entity20 to make a difference , friends and former colleagues said			1
he took mission trips to @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 , they said			0
" he intended to be a missionary before he became a doctor , " friend @entity28 , an elder at @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31 , told @entity32			0
" eventually , he decided medical mission is what he wanted to do			0
" @entity0 went to @entity11 with his wife and two children last year to serve a two - year fellowship through @entity41 post-residency program			1
he was there initially to practice general medicine			0
but when the @entity15 outbreak began , he took on the role of medical director for the @entity47 in @entity48			2
it 's there that he tested positive for the virus , according to the evangelical christian relief charity			0
there is no known cure or vaccine for @entity15 , and it has a mortality rate of up to 90 %			2
@entity57 : ebola patient arrives @entity0 is in an isolation ward at @entity60 , near the headquarters for the @entity62			1
doctor put sick patients first the news @entity0 contracted @entity15 has prompted many to ask why would he put himself at risk			1
the answer might be difficult for some to understand , his former college and medical school professor wrote in an op - ed published this week in the @entity72			0
" simply put , he would say that he had been called to care for the patients in @entity11 , " @entity73 wrote in the newspaper			2
none of it has been surprising to @entity28 , who first met @entity0 five years ago at church			2
" when he first started coming to our church , he and his wife made it clear ... they were committed to medical missions , " he said			0
before heading to @entity11 in october 2013 , @entity0 did his residency at @entity87 in @entity30			2
' what do i bring to the table ? ' " we 're kind of proud that there was a hero out there trying to do his best to make life better for other folks under the circumstances , " a physician who knows him , dr. @entity91 of @entity93 ' @entity92 , told @entity32 affiliate @entity95 this week			0
@entity0 attended high school in @entity104 before graduating from @entity105 ( @entity31 ) in 2003 and @entity107 's medical school in 2009			2
while at @entity105 , he spent a summer interning overseas with a program focused on vocational missions experiences , @entity105 's online alumni magazine reported			0
" everyone here who has been connected with @entity113 knows him to be someone who is very compassionate , considerate and always upbeat in all he does , " the program 's director , dr. @entity115 , told the magazine			2
" ... @entity113 's the kind of guy who would weigh benefits versus risk , then try to take himself out of the equation so that he would be thinking , ' what do i bring to the table ? is the risk worth taking because i can benefit so many people ? ' " it perhaps may explain why when only one dose of an experimental serum to treat @entity15 was made available this week in @entity11 that @entity0 turned it down and asked that it be given to his colleague			1
" i would have been surprised if he had not done that , " @entity28 said			0
' praying fervently ' in an e-mail this week from @entity48 , @entity0 told a fellow doctor at @entity87 that he is " terrified , " according to the @entity72			1

though @entity0 's wife and children had been in @entity11 with him , they were in the @entity9 when he became ill. " many people have been asking how i am doing , " @entity145 said in a statement released earlier this week			1
" the children and i are physically fine			0
" the @entity62 has said neither @entity0 's wife or his children are symptomatic			1
@entity0 's wife , parents and sister cried when they saw him on @entity32 , walking from the ambulance into the hospital , a family representative said on condition of anonymity			1
his wife , @entity158 , later said she was relieved that her husband was back in the @entity9			0
