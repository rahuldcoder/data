-- @entity2 legislators passed several restrictive abortion bills this week , including one that could mean felony charge against any doctor performing such a procedure on a woman who 'd been pregnant as little as six weeks			1
the four measures easily passed the state 's @entity11 on tuesday , and they still need to go through the @entity13 and be signed by gov. @entity14 to become law			1
both of those steps are real possibilities , given @entity2 's conservative bent and the fact the @entity13 , like the @entity11 , is @entity21 dominated and @entity14 belongs to that party			1
still , even if all that happens , it 's no guarantee that all of the measures will become law			2
last year , @entity28 passed its own law to ban abortions when a fetal heartbeat is detected -- much like one passed tuesday , by an overwhelming 73 - 29 margin , by @entity2 representatives			1
but a federal judge , @entity34 , subsequently granted a temporary injunction blocking the law 's enforcement because its pre-viability provisions were " invalid and unconstitutional			2
" in his decision , the judge said " there is no question " that the law known as @entity44 directly contradicts a " litany " of @entity47 cases that address restraints on abortion , including @entity50			0
judge blocks restrictive @entity28 abortion law like that @entity28 legislation , the @entity2 law does not mention abortions being allowed in cases of rape or incest			1
the only exception is when not having an abortion " is likely to result in the death of the pregnant woman or is likely to result in substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman , not including psychological or emotional conditions			0
doctors would be required to check for a fetal heartbeat			1
if they do n't , they 'd be charged with a @entity70 felony			0
they would be similarly charged if they check and find a heartbeat , then perform an abortion			0
( the pregnant woman would not face charges			0
) " in almost every medical situation , the litmus test to determine the need for continued medical treatment is the existence of a pulse , " state rep. @entity76 , a sponsor of the bill , said in a statement			0
" we owe the same respect and reverence to the life of an unborn child that we would pay to any person facing a medical emergency			1
" as the @entity96 and other experts and groups note , a fetus ' heartbeat typically can not be detected until at least 6 weeks into a woman 's pregnancy			1
the @entity2 and @entity28 laws , then , would effectively ban abortions beyond that point -- making them the most restrictive such laws in the country			1
a number of states have passed abortion bans after 20 weeks , such as @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity2			2
@entity115 has a ban in place for pregnancies beyond 12 weeks			0
some states have no time limit , while others allow abortion up to the end of the second trimester , which is about 27 or 28 weeks into one 's pregnancy			0
in addition to @entity76 's bill -- which is dubbed the @entity130 -- the @entity2 state representatives chamber also passed a measure increasing the required wait time before an abortion is performed from 24 to 48 hours			1
another bill states that a woman must be informed about perinatal hospital services as alternatives to abortion when a fetus is found to have a condition that will likely result in death within three months of birth			0
the pregnant woman must then state , in writing , that she is declining such hospice services			0
lastly , a fourth bill toughens parental consent requirements for minors seeking abortions			2
they can go through the courts to try to get the chance to have such a procedure without a parent or legal guardian 's consent			2
and the bill also prohibits parents from coercing a minor into having an abortion			0
house speaker @entity162 lauded these bills and others , saying he is " proud to lead the @entity11 at a time when we have enacted more pro-life protections than at any other period in @entity2 history			2
" " in @entity2 , we will fight tooth and nail to preserve and protect the life of the unborn until the liberal , activist @entity47 decision making abortion legal in the @entity178 is overturned , " @entity162 said			2
" republicans in the @entity180 believe that life begins at conception and that a heartbeat is evidence of a viable life that deserves to be defended			0
" but @entity186 , an official with @entity187 , sharply criticized the measure , including the so - called @entity130 , which she noted would bar abortions " before some women even realize they are pregnant			0
" " it 's part of an extreme agenda to restrict all abortions under any circumstances in the state of @entity2 , " she said from @entity191 , one of five @entity2 cities that have abortion clinics			1
" all of these are another attack on women 's healthcare			0
" and the @entity204 of @entity2 called out the legislators for passing bills that will " invite litigation ( that ) will cost the state dearly			1
" " this callous and reckless behavior proves that politicians are n't conscious of @entity2 citizens or the financial catastrophe that this state is in and are more interested in pandering than they are in solving the problems facing @entity2 , " the @entity204 said			1
this is n't the first time @entity2 legislators have passed a restrictive abortion law that 's brought opposition and possible interference from the courts			1
last july , @entity178 district judge @entity221 issued a temporary restraining order that blocks @entity2 from enforcing a key portion of a new abortion law that requires doctors at an abortion clinic to have admitting privileges at a local hospital			1
the state had argued the measure is designed to protect the health of a patient			0
the plaintiffs call it medically unnecessary due to the safety of abortion procedures and said enforcement of the section will force them to shut down			0
judge bars @entity2 from enforcing provision in abortion law			2

@entity2 legislators pass 4 restrictive abortions bills ; none are state law -- yet
one would charge doctors for doing abortions if there 's a fetal heartbeat detected
others deal with consent , mother 's sign - off if their unborn child as a fatal defect
the @entity204 says these bills will " invite litigation ( that ) will cost the state dearly "
