-- as i sipped @entity3 and breathed in the clear icy air of @entity5 , my boyfriend @entity6 got down on one knee , offered a glistening diamond ring and asked , " @entity9 , will you marry me ? " i was shocked , floored , stunned			1
i dropped my @entity3 and almost passed out			2
this was my first marriage proposal , but not my first marriage			1
when @entity6 suggested our mountain vacation , i had just finished a book tour to promote my memoir , " how to get divorced by 30			1
" that divorce was from my first , lovable , lackadaisical stoner husband whom i married at age 27			1
we 'd been dating for 3 years when my arbitrary timetable had hit its must - get - married date			2
he never actually proposed , we just decided one night we would " do this			0
" i bought my own engagement ring , choosing something untraditional so if we ever got divorced i could wear it on my right hand			0
i was planning my divorce while i was planning my wedding			1
and i did everything in my power to pretend it was n't really a wedding at all			1
three months after the non-proposal , we had a stand - up comedian perform the ceremony in a friend 's yard and never uttered the words love , forever , or til death do us part			1
eventually i realized i was unhappy and way too young to be stuck in nuptial mediocrity , so i was divorced by 30			0
now as i stood with @entity6 , it dawned on me that this romantic mountain touring spot was private not because we had lucked out , but because he had rented out the whole area			0
he had spent months having the ring custom made with the help of my sister and he had told my father about his intentions the previous winter			0
while @entity6 was planning this proposal fit for a big glossy studio romcom , i was traveling around the country discussing and defending my book about my starter marriage			1
when asked by interviewers and fans if i would ever get married again , i always answered " i might get married again , but i wo n't get divorced again			0
" although i had been with @entity6 for over 2 years and was madly in love , i was n't focused on marriage			1
i was focused on enjoying the relationship			0
yet another giant difference between what i did wrong the first time , and what i was doing right this time			0
second weddings are often small , discreet and sensible			0
and for a moment after @entity6 proposed i wanted to run to a courthouse or elope to @entity67 , too embarrassed to have another wedding , especially since i had just written a book about divorce			1
but @entity6 , who has never been married before , feels strongly about having a real wedding , so i decided to succumb to the juggernaut that is the wedding industry and have a second wedding , which will feel like most people 's first			1
i 'm getting wrapped up in trumpet versus mermaid versus princess - cut wedding dresses , in color schemes and bouquet shapes and invitation fonts			2
i 'm enjoying the small moments of making decisions with @entity6 about venues and open bars and save the date cards			0
as we plan together we are solidifying our bond , compromising on likes and dislikes , but not to the point that both of us are unhappy			0
i 'm energized by the process as well as reveling in the idea of spending the rest of my life with someone , saying words like love and forever , and wearing an actual engagement ring that 's important -- not because it 's so damn sparkly and pretty -- but because it was picked out with care and symbolizes something timeless and meaningful			1
like many brides - to - be now my days consist of trying on @entity104 gowns , thumbing through cheesy bridal magazines and wondering about flower budgets			0
but in between all this wedding planning , i 'm signing copies of my book and dispensing advice to distraught readers about the merits of young divorce			1
it certainly beats staying in an unhappy marriage			2
i 'm giving interviews about why divorce can be a great rite of passage , and why starter marriages , if dissected , can be necessary to fixing one 's own flaws and to finding the right person the second time around			2
i 'm on the phone with the wedding planner one minute and then running out the door to a " single ladies " author 's panel the next			2
the timing of it all is bizarre to say the least , but somehow totally fitting			0
had i not gotten divorced by 30 , forced myself to question my failed marriage and then written a book about it , i doubt i would have ever been able to sustain a healthy relationship			2
i believe in divorce , and i believe in marriage			1
perhaps my follow - up book will be " how to get remarried by 35 ... and stay that way			0

while promoting her memoir on divorce , @entity9 gets marriage proposal
no proposal , no wedding dress , but a comedian *conducted* first wedding
second wedding is being planned seriously , vows to *include* " love " and " forever "
