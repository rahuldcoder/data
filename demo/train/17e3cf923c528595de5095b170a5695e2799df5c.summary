-- there was a phrase , or so we have long been told , that was heard in occupied @entity5 during @entity6 it was often said as a whisper , the story goes			2
it had the sound of a prayer			2
the words were so simple , but to people who were feeling utterly abandoned and who needed help , those words meant so much			0
four words : " the @entity18 are coming			1
" sometimes we forget about the power of those words , and about how , for so long , they defined the real meaning of what this country , at its best , could be			0
sometimes , in the midst of all the bad news , in the midst of the mistakes this country inevitably makes , we lose sight of how much the people of the @entity18 are counted on by those in need			1
which is why the humanitarian efforts in @entity38 this month , in the wake of the earthquake , have been a reminder of who we are when we strive to find our finest selves			1
the relief efforts have been an international undertaking ; the heartache on the streets of @entity38 has summoned compassionate and heroic assistance from around the globe , all of it deserving of praise and gratitude			1
but the @entity18 has been at the forefront , as it has so often seemed to be in so many places when hope was in short supply			1
it is almost beyond imagining to think what has been in the terrified minds of the citizens of @entity38 who have been without water , without food , without a way to rescue their trapped and dying children			1
when there is nothing left to depend on , when all is desolation and despair , what must the hungry and the hurt wish for as they look into the empty distance ? someone to care			0
someone to travel many miles , with the will and the means to heal			0
the slowness with which medical supplies and water and heavy equipment have reached the people of @entity38 has been thoroughly reported			1
some of the results of the relief effort have been troubling , beset by bottlenecks and breakdowns under arduous conditions			0
but this is not about the frustrations in getting the job done			0
it is about the @entity18 impulse to help			1
there is nothing particularly controversial , these days , about pointing out the failings of the @entity18			2
you can say just about any derogatory thing about the @entity18 , and it 's not especially shocking			2
we 're used to hearing it			0
already , as the tragedy in @entity38 continues to unfold , there have been pockets of harsh criticism of @entity18 's efforts to help			1
@entity104 cooperation minister @entity103 alluded to the @entity18 " occupying " @entity38 instead of assisting it			1
it is not the first time the @entity18 has been chastised , and it will not be the last			2
the history of the @entity18 involvement in @entity38 has not always been a happy or unsullied one			1
but perhaps we can take just a moment to think about the honor that is inherent in being the ones who , at junctures like this one , are counted on -- the ones who show up , every time			0
during @entity6 , those four words -- " the @entity18 are coming " -- referred to the armed forces who had traveled across the ocean to liberate the people the @entity124 had enslaved			2
in times of natural disaster , the context is different			0
in @entity38 the words refer to the @entity129 , yes , but they also refer to the @entity18 doctors who are volunteering their time and risking their own safety to soothe the pain of people they had never before met			1
the words refer to the @entity18 volunteers assisting at @entity38 orphanages , not giving up on the children who have no families to comfort them			1
the words refer to the @entity18 search - and - rescue teams who work past the point of exhaustion as they seek signs of the living among the rubble , and they refer to the @entity18 back home who , during difficult economic times in the @entity18 , have donated their money to help people who , for now , have no way to say thank you			2
the focus of the news will shift soon enough -- that shift has already started			0
there will be other crises , other major stories			0
we , as a country and as individuals , will continue to be imperfect			0
there will be political squabbles and high - decibel partisan fights			0
we will at times focus on the trivial and the coarse			0
at such times , we might do well to pause and recall the sound of those four words			0
and to let the words remind us that , when we set our souls to it , we still can aspire to be the hope of the world			1
