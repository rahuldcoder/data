-- a @entity3 fan who became so disillusioned with the rebranding of the football club he followed that he put his support up for auction on @entity8 has a new team to follow -- @entity10			1
the final straw for @entity13 fan @entity12 was the decision by the @entity18 team 's @entity16 owners to rebrand the club by insisting they play in red rather than their traditional blue to boost their appeal to @entity26 audiences			0
the internet sparked global interest with @entity12 's support eventually bought by a @entity10 fan for over a thousand dollars			1
" the reception from @entity10 fans that have been in contact with me has been great and i 've had offers of help with tickets and people to attend games with , " @entity12 told @entity0			2
" i will also be looking to attend some @entity41 fixtures , with my only previous experience of @entity44 football coming from watching @entity3 win the @entity45 against @entity46 in 2008			0
" trips to @entity10 's home ground will involve a 320 mile round - trip for @entity12 , but he does n't seem daunted as at one stage it looked like he might have to travel abroad in his new supporter project			1
" as the auction began to get worldwide coverage , i moved from getting bids from places such as @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 to getting bids from @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and the west coast of @entity65 ! " i was rather worried at this stage			1
traveling to @entity67 and @entity68 away with @entity13 was one thing , but @entity71 away was probably pushing it ! " just when it looked like i would be clocking up some serious air miles , a bidder from north @entity75 came in and won the auction with a bid of $ 1,324			1
" @entity3 have come agonizingly close to promotion to the @entity79 in the last few years , so @entity12 is looking forward to experiencing life in @entity82 football ' s top			2
" i am most excited about visiting new grounds and the new experiences that @entity10 will bring			0
" by a curious twist of fate , @entity12 already has an association with @entity10 as his father is a @entity10 supporter			1
" @entity10 are the team supported by my father , meaning that i will be able to talk to him about footballers he cares about			2
" the @entity8 bid has only bought @entity12 's support for a season , but he is already making plans for next year in case @entity3 do n't return to being the club he used to support			1
" i 'm praying it 's a one season only thing			0
if it is n't , then i will either stick with @entity10 , as i believe they are a club who can restore a bit of my faith in modern football , or donate the cost of my @entity13 season ticket to charity and watch non-league football instead			0
" however , having become so disheartened with @entity13 , the internet auction has gone some way to restoring his faith in football			0
" while in an ideal world i would still feel connected to @entity13 enough to support them , @entity10 have gone a long way to show the good side of the game			0
" if you do n't get goosebumps when @entity10 fans sing " oh when the @entity10 " then you either support one of their rivals or you probably do n't like football very much			0
" the winning bid proceeds are to be split between @entity128 military charity @entity129 and @entity130 , a charity that help life - limited children in @entity133 .			2

@entity12 put his support up for auction after @entity3 were rebranded
a winning bid of $ 1,324 sees him support @entity10 next season
bids on @entity8 came from @entity142 , @entity61 and @entity62
@entity12 's father has always supported @entity10
