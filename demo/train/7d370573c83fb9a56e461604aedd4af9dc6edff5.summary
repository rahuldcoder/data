" @entity0 " @entity1 wrote " @entity3 " for @entity2			1
written by : @entity4 written for : some girl probably not named @entity6			1
in fact , as far as most historians can tell , @entity4 did n't even know an @entity6			1
instead , the song was originally titled " @entity10 in a minor " based on some handwritten notation a @entity4 researcher claimed to have seen on a now - lost copy of the sheet music			1
further complicating things , @entity4 had hideous handwriting -- to the point that some scholars speculate the song was actually written " for @entity19 , " as in @entity20 , one of several women who turned down a marriage proposal from the notoriously lovesick maestro			1
" @entity24 " written by : @entity25 & @entity26 written for : @entity27 , as a thank - you for a tracksuit she gave @entity25			1
and what a tracksuit it must have been ! the 1975 song remains one of the most popular disco hits ever , leaving thousands of @entity37 enthusiasts wondering just what @entity27 had to do with @entity39 , anyway			2
turns out , the song was a reference to @entity27 's pro tennis team , @entity42			1
prior to 1968 , tennis players were all considered " amateurs " and were n't eligible to receive prize money			2
so , if you did n't have the wealth to support yourself , you could n't play			2
@entity27 fought against those constraints , ultimately founding professional @entity49 in 1974 and turning tennis into a paid league sport			2
" @entity53 " written by : the @entity55 ' @entity54 written for : a transvestite			1
but the question is , which one ? according to @entity58 , " @entity53 " was inspired by @entity59 , a member of @entity61 's entourage , whom @entity54 briefly ( and cluelessly ) dated			1
if that 's the case , then " @entity53 " is just another notch on @entity59 's song belt -- she 's also referred to in @entity65 's " @entity66			1
" ( " @entity59 came from out on the @entity67 / in the backroom she was everybody 's darlin '			1
" ) but , in the @entity55 ' official biography , @entity54 tells a different story			0
he says " @entity53 " was written after the band 's manager spent a very drunken night dancing with a woman whose five o'clock shadow was apparently obvious to everyone but him			1
" @entity80 " written by : @entity81 ( of @entity82 ) and @entity83 written for : unknown , as the songwriters apparently make up a different story about its inspiration every time they 're asked			1
while the woman continues to remain a mystery , however , the phone number is all too real			1
in fact , it 's been wreaking havoc ever since 1982 and the passage of time has n't quelled of the number of crank calls			1
in 1999 , @entity98 freshman roommates @entity99 and @entity100 found that out the hard way , when the school adopted an 867 exchange number for its on - campus phone system			0
immediately , the girls ' innocuous @entity105 became a magnet for every drunk college kid with a 1980s fetish			0
other unfortunate phone customers have fought back with creative and profitable solutions , like the holder of 212 - 867 - 5309 , who put his phone number up for auction on @entity116 in 2004			0
bids approached $ 100,000 before @entity116 pulled the item at the request of @entity120 , the number 's actual owner			1
" oh , @entity123 " written by : @entity124 written for : @entity125 , naturally			1
@entity124 and @entity27 actually dated briefly in high school -- a romance @entity124 was able to successfully milk with " oh , @entity123 , " a then top - 10 ( if now somewhat forgettable ) 1959 pop song			0
however , the real success of " oh , @entity123 " came a few months later , when it inspired @entity27 to write a rebuttal entitled " oh , @entity124			0
" at the time , @entity27 and her husband , @entity131 , were fledgling songwriters in need of a hit tune			2
" oh , @entity124 " was n't that , but it did pay off			0
after @entity124 gave a tape of the song to his boss , @entity27 and @entity131 landed jobs at the legendary @entity143 pop music factory , where the duo went on to write chart - toppers like " @entity146 " and " @entity147			0
" @entity3 " written by : @entity1 written for : @entity2 , though it clearly was n't the nicest gift @entity1 could have given her			2
the two met in 1961 , when @entity2 was an up - and - coming folk singer and @entity1 was a nobody from @entity151			0
desperate to make his break in the music biz , @entity1 worked like crazy to get @entity2 's attention			1
he eventually ended up going on tour with her , which is how he first became famous , and also how the two began dating			2
for a while , they seemed like the golden couple , but things soon went downhill			0
during a @entity165 concert tour together in early 1965 , they had a huge fight and parted ways			0
that may , @entity1 was holed up in a hotel after being hospitalized with a virus , and @entity2 , hoping to remain friends , decided to bring him flowers			0
sadly , that 's how she found out that her ex was already dating someone else			2
that someone else was @entity176 , whom @entity1 married a mere six months later			0
" @entity177 " written by : @entity178 ( of @entity179 ) written for : @entity180			2
in december 1968 , @entity178 and @entity180 moved into a cozy little house in the @entity183 section of @entity184			0
though commonly left out of the hippy pantheon , @entity183 was sort of a commune - home away from commune - home for @entity190 society -- not just @entity179 , but also @entity191 , the @entity192 , @entity193 , and more			0
" @entity177 " was directly inspired by a lazy sunday in the @entity178 / @entity180 household			0
the couple went out to brunch , hit an antiques store , and then returned to find the house just a bit chilly , at which point @entity178 literally " lit a fire , " while @entity180 " placed the flowers in the vase that she bought that day			0
the whole tableau seemed so ridiculously domestic to @entity178 that he immediately sat down and spent the rest of the day writing about it			0
