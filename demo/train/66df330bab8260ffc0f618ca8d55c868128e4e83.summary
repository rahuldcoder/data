the race to develop an effective treatment or vaccine against @entity3 is on as the largest outbreak in history continues to spread in @entity6			1
meanwhile , questions about whether unproven treatments are appropriate to use , and who should get them , are inspiring passion and resentment			2
on wednesday , an @entity15 - based company called @entity16 said it has enough doses of an experimental @entity3 vaccine to begin clinical trials in the next few weeks , if such trials are approved			1
meanwhile , a shipment of 800 to 1,000 doses of the vaccine , known as @entity24 , were delivered to health officials in @entity26 , as a donation from the @entity28			2
the @entity30 agency developed the vaccine but says its stockpile is gone			0
earlier in the week , we learned that @entity34 also sent its entire stock of the experimental drug @entity36 to the government of @entity26			0
left undetermined is which individuals will receive any of the drugs			0
as we track these and other developments , here are 10 facts to keep in mind about @entity3 and experimental drugs : 1			1
there is no approved or scientifically proven treatment for @entity3 , and no vaccine			1
whether the setting is primitive or in a developed country 's advanced hospital , existing treatment is primarily supportive : giving fluids , carefully monitoring vital signs and responding to acute medical crises			0
there are several experimental drugs in development , with the potential to be useful against @entity3			1
the market for these drugs is small -- @entity3 is a rare disease , almost completely confined to poor countries -- so funding for drug development has come largely from government agencies in the @entity68 and @entity30			1
" vaccine " and " treatment " are not interchangeable terms			1
a vaccine is given to prevent infection , whereas treatment generally refers to a drug given to a patient who has developed symptoms			2
@entity36 , given to @entity68 medical workers @entity79 and dr. @entity80 when they were seriously ill , is not a vaccine			0
another term you may hear is " post-exposure prophylaxis , " meaning a drug that is given to a person who has been exposed to an infection , but is not yet sick			0
a familiar example is the rabies vaccine , often given to someone after they have been bitten by a rabid animal			0
some promising @entity3 drugs , like @entity94 's @entity3 , have been developed and tested as " post-exposure prophylaxis			1
" be warned : the terms can become confusing because research is ongoing and there 's no clear evidence to define the window of time for treatment to be effective -- or if this type of drug might still be helpful once symptoms develop			2
this uncertainty influences the decisions that doctors and health officials have to make in determining if and when to use experimental drugs , especially those in short supply			1
no @entity3 treatment has been formally tested in humans with the illness			1
@entity36 has been given to at least three people in the current outbreak ( the two @entity68 and a @entity119 priest ) ; experts say they are studying the cases , but there is not enough evidence to say whether the drug will be effective in others			0
at least one @entity3 therapy ( @entity3 ) has been tested for safety in a small clinical trial ; it was given to healthy human volunteers to see if they suffered any adverse effects			1
to date there have not been serious side effects			0
one experimental post-exposure prophylaxis drug was given to a @entity135 researcher in 2009 after he pricked himself with a needle thought to carry @entity3			2
he did not develop the disease			0
a handful of potential treatments have been tested in primates that have been infected with @entity3			1
macaque monkeys are the usual test subjects			0
the @entity143 says a safety trial of an experimental vaccine could begin as early as september			2
other companies are also preparing for new clinical trials			0
at least one group of researchers -- at the @entity150 -- is working with a $ 26 million award from @entity143 to test the possibility of combining multiple therapies , similar to the @entity155 - fighting " cocktail " approach .			0
