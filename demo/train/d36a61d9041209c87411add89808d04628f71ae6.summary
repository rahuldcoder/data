-- the co-owner of a supply company			0
the director of housing preservation and development			0
they are seven guys headed to the @entity15 - @entity14 @entity13 game on thursday night			1
at the beginning of the week it did n't look like they 'd make it			0
but thanks to a new contract with the @entity13 , veteran officials will work the game			1
those seven men have a second , part - time job as @entity13 officials			1
referee @entity26 and his six officials have been given the assignment of replacing the replacement refs , whose three weeks during the regular season produced many memorable moments , the kind that made fans and players actually wish for the old officials to come back			2
@entity36 apologizes to fans but it 's not like the 121 @entity13 officials who had been locked out of the league were just sitting on the couch all day			1
most officials have a primary job , though a few are retired			1
and what they really do for a living varies from airline pilot to claims adjuster to sporting goods store owner to educator			0
one of the @entity13 's best known referees , @entity52 , a partner at a law firm in @entity54 , told @entity56 's @entity55 earlier this month that officials often spend as many as 30 hours a week during the season at their part - time gigs			1
factor in travel to games and meetings and it can be as many as 50 hours , said @entity64 , who was a fill - in official during the lockout			2
@entity66 : @entity13 's most embarrassing moments they watch film for hours , have to take a weekly rules test and read what are called case books -- thick binders full of plays that give guidance on rules			1
and there 's also conditioning			2
@entity66 : @entity52 gives inside peek at typical play there are 17 crews in the @entity13 , so weekends like this , when four teams have the week off , there are only 15 games			1
the crews that do n't work do n't get paid			0
and it can be a very hard job to get			2
a quick scan of the 2012 roster of officials showed there are no rookies , and only 21 officials had five years or fewer of @entity13 experience			1
most have been in the league for 10 years or more			1
line judge @entity98 is in his 27th season			0
according to the league 's website , applicants need to have 10 years of officiating experience , five of which must be above the high school level			1
the career path generally is work as a high school official , get some big game assignments , get hired by a college league and apply for an @entity13 position			1
and wait for the call			0
points of contention in negotiations for @entity64 , it never worked out despite 15 years in with the @entity117 and 12 years at lower - division leagues			2
work had something to do with that			0
he has been assistant commissioner at the @entity123 for 17 years			0
for @entity125 it did work out			0
a former college quarterback , he told the @entity128 that he jumped into football officiating in 1983 and spent time as a @entity131 official			0
eventually he was hired by the @entity13 in 2003 as a field judge and became a referee three years later			1
he also officiates college basketball , the only @entity13 referee to do so			2
so he 's very used to being in the spotlight , being booed and jeered			0
on thursday night , he and his six co-workers will be back at their second jobs , and for a change , there probably will be some cheers in the air			0
@entity66 's @entity143 : pressure is on for real refs			0

for most @entity13 officials , this is their weekend job
it 's a hard *profession* to break into with only 121 spots
most start out officiating high school games
@entity13 wants applicants to have 10 years ' experience
