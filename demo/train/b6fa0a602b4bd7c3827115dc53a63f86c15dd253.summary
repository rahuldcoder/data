on sunday , the @entity0 announced it transferred six @entity2 detainees to @entity3 for resettlement as refugees , a move which @entity8 chairman @entity7 says should be reconsidered			1
" i 've been opposed to this notion that we 're going to farm out @entity16 to places , " @entity7 told @entity9 on @entity11 's " @entity10 , " noting most of the detainees sent to @entity3 are not originally from there			1
according to @entity7 , the foreign intelligence services the @entity19 pays to monitor the newly released detainees in countries such as @entity3 are often ill - equipped to handle the job			1
" what we have found in the past is it does n't work very well , " he said			0
" i do n't think that surprises anybody			0
so i argue that maybe we ought to rethink what we 're doing here			0
" echoing the sentiments of many members of @entity32 , @entity7 said some previously released prisoners are now re-engaged in the terrorist fight			1
" we knew that was going to happen , " @entity7 said			2
" that 's why those of us who were trying to do the review of this were so concerned , because they were so interested in getting them out , that they forgot to do the due diligence -- i think -- that would allow them to at least protect those that were going to go back into the fight , from getting back into the fight			0
" last week , the @entity51 administration suffered a huge setback in its attempt to close down the detention camp permanently when the @entity8 passed a $ 585 billion defense authorization bill excluding language that would have banned the transfer of any more prisoners to @entity2 , a stipulation the @entity8 had sought			1
on monday , @entity61 chairman @entity60 , @entity62 , said it would also likely be absent from the final bill sent to the president 's desk			0
" our language ( on @entity2 ) ... will not be in , " @entity60 told reporters last week			2
the president has sought to close @entity2 since he took office in 2008 -- and issued an executive order to do so in 2009 -- but has faced fierce opposition from members of @entity32 , like @entity7 , who allege that doing so is a threat to national security			1
outgoing defense secretary @entity77 , who recently announced his resignation in light of administrative pressure , authorized the prisoner release , according to the @entity0			1
his reluctance to approve the mission until now could have been a part of the tension leading to his resignation			0
but @entity8 member @entity87 , @entity88 , defended @entity90 's decision to delay the authorization of the mission , citing his continued concerns over the timing of the prisoner release			2

" " he wanted to make sure that he was satisfied that he could sign on the dotted line			0
" @entity87 pointed to @entity3 's recent presidential election as one of the roadblocks			2

" and so it was stayed until after that election was over			0
