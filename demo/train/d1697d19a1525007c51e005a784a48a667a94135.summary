-- for decades , @entity1 has been a hub of african - american culture and the @entity4			2
but this month , the issue of charter schools has turned the @entity8 neighborhood into a battleground between activists and the 101 - year - old civil rights organization			1
the strain was as clear as the signs and chants during a rally thursday in @entity1 -- " @entity4 , @entity16 , @entity17 ! " about 4 % of @entity8 's roughly 1 million students currently attend charter schools -- which are paid with public funds but typically have different mandates , approaches and staffing arrangements that traditional schools			1
another 50,000 students are on waiting lists			0
a proposal to expand access to charter schools and allow charters to co-locate -- or be based in the same building -- as regular schools has turned some traditional allies against each other			1
the rift accelerated in may , when the @entity4 and the @entity36 -- a union of 200,000 @entity8 teachers and school staff -- filed a lawsuit in @entity40			1
besides asking to stop 22 school closings , the lawsuit urged halting the plan to expand or co-locate 20 charter schools			1
on its website , the teachers ' union calls the initiative illegal and claims it would give " charter school students more access to school facilities , including libraries , auditoriums and lunchrooms , than students in the public schools that would share the buildings			1
" while a teachers union opposing charter schools is hardly unprecedented , leaders of the local @entity4 said they decided to step in and support the lawsuit in order to best ensure a level playing field for all @entity8 students			1
@entity65 , president of the @entity4 's @entity8 chapter , said the group is fighting for equal education for all -- similar to the landmark @entity70 decision on @entity72 , which mandated equal education regardless of race			2
" the facilities should be in good condition on both sides , " said @entity76			0
" there should not be a 10 o'clock lunch hour and a 12 o'clock lunch hour			0
there should be one 12 o'clock lunch hour			0
" yet @entity85 , a nationally renowned educator who is the president and ceo of @entity87 , thinks more charter schools in @entity8 are the solution -- not the problem			1
that 's why he joined parents thursday calling for the @entity4 and teachers ' union to drop the lawsuit , or at least the part pertaining to charter schools			1
@entity98 , who attended the rally , said the @entity4 's stance is counterproductive if its goal is to support the rejuvenation of @entity8 schools			2
" the @entity4 has always backed minorities and african - americans , so it 's just surprising they 're moving against us now , " she said			0
" it 's like moving backwards , when we should be pushing forward			0
" @entity110 , a single parent whose daughter attends a charter school , said that the trickle - down effect of closing schools and limiting options could be devastating			2
" i 'm not going to put her in a failing public school , " @entity98 said			0
@entity118 said that 's where the efforts should be focused : on making sure no existing public schools are failing , not to create more charter schools at the expense of traditional ones			2
the mother of eight insisted that those rallying in @entity1 on thursday and those behind the lawsuit -- like herself -- have more in common than they might think			0
" now we 're engaged with parents and having them come out in busloads to fight against other parents fighting for the same thing -- the right for a quality education , " said @entity118 , an organizer with the @entity131			0
" we 're not asking for more			0

the @entity4 and a @entity8 teachers ' union are trying to stop 22 school closures
the groups want to stop the expansion or co-location of 20 charter schools
an @entity4 *official* says the plan *unfairly* *favors* charters at the expense of regular schools
but some , like activist @entity85 , say more charter schools are needed
