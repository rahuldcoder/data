@entity0 , @entity1 -- the mayor of @entity1 's restive southern city of @entity4 -- a resolute and proud public official who was regularly surrounded by armed guards and long under threat of death -- was slain wednesday in a suicide bombing			1
@entity10 , 65 , was killed during a city hall meeting in the provincial capital when explosives detonated inside the turban of his attacker , according to @entity17 , a spokesman for the @entity4 governor 's office			1
the assault comes several months after @entity10 told @entity2 in an interview that he did n't feel safe and that his life was in danger , most particularly from what he described as corrupt officials , but sloughed off family pleas to quit his position in @entity4			1
" i was born in this province , " @entity10 said in december , referring to @entity4 province			2
" i eat from this province			0
i educate from this province			0
i study from this province			0
and i have good times in this province			0
and i owe this province			0
i have to work for this , my city			0
" 2010 interview with the @entity4 mayor it is the latest in a series of recent high - profile assassinations claimed by the @entity38			1
but the newly appointed @entity40 ambassador to @entity1 , @entity41 , cautioned against definitively pinning the attacks on the @entity38 , despite the group 's claims			1
" it 's not clear to me that this was a @entity38 - conducted act , " said @entity41 , who pointed to a recent demonstration in front of the mayor 's office over a " road - building incident that resulted in the deaths of one or two young girls			1
" @entity41 added that " this could turn out to be a murder that did n't have anything to do with the @entity38			1
" authorities say the mayor was leaving the meeting hall when the attack occurred , and @entity17 said that " it 's not clear whether the suicide attack was from the children 's relatives " or from insurgents			1
one civilian was also injured in the attack			2
interviewed by @entity2 's @entity67 , @entity10 had to have armed guards with him wherever he went			1
while he traveled in a bullet - proof vehicle , he was still vulnerable because of the threat of powerful roadside bombs			2
he cited dangers from many sources			0
" police warlords , drug dealers and power brokers are enemies of peace , enemies of security and development , " he said in december			0
he said such people did " very bad things " and were destroying the city			0
he wondered how the city could be built and how peace could be brought to it , while the rebuilding process was slow and there were delays in " locking in " security gains			0
his plans have not been popular with everyone , and he blamed tribal differences			0
" my way is we have to do ( rebuilding ) very quickly			0
we have to show to our people good service and quickly			0
these people are hungry for good service , " he said			0
it is the second time in less than two weeks that a senior official was killed by suicide bombers who placed explosives in their turbans			0
the attack is also the latest in a string of killings across the country , and the most recent for a region that appears to be deadly for high - ranking officials			2
two deputy mayors of @entity4 have been gunned down by militants in the past year , according to the governor 's office			2
kandahar police chief @entity115 was also killed by a suicide bomber in april			0
@entity10 told @entity2 in december that the chief was a warlord			2
but perhaps the most high - profile attack occurred earlier this month when @entity4 's provincial council chief , @entity119 -- the president 's half - brother and an influential power broker in country 's south -- was gunned down by a longtime bodyguard inside his home			1
the @entity38 also claimed responsibility for that attack , though rumors soon swirled that his death could also have been the result of a murder over personal grievances			1
@entity133 : what @entity119 's death teaches us still , @entity119 's assassination , wednesday 's attack and a list of others have highlighted security questions about who can be trusted in @entity1			1
during a remembrance ceremony for the president 's half - brother at a @entity4 mosque two days after his death , a suicide bomber slipped into the building and killed six people and wounded 15 others			1
that bomber also placed explosives inside his turban			0
within the next week , a key political adviser to the @entity1 president and a @entity157 member were gunned down in a home west of @entity0			1
the killings have taken place just as a security transfer to @entity1 control and a @entity164 draw - down is under way			1
speaking to the media for the first time since being formally sworn in , @entity41 said the @entity40 condemns wednesday 's attack " in the strongest possible terms			1
" " our condolences are with his family and with the government and people of @entity1 , " he said			2
@entity41 called the killing " another indication of both the challenges that @entity1 faces , but also the extraordinary resilience of the @entity1 government and people			1
" @entity1 president @entity181 also condemned wednesday 's assassination , saying the attack was carried out by " the enemies of peace			1
" the new @entity40 ambassador described the recent attacks as " horrific , " but also said that if @entity38 were responsible , it can be " interpreted as a sign of significant organizational weakness on the part of the adversary			2
" a recent uptick in joint @entity1 - @entity164 raids has killed many of the @entity38 's senior and mid-level commanders across the southern and eastern provinces			1
" the @entity38 is now damaged to the point where they can no longer conduct large - scale operations , " @entity41 said			1
" they 've had to regroup and figure out what they can do			0
" the incidents came as @entity164 forces are beginning the first stage of a troop draw - down , which is expected to remove 10,000 soldiers from @entity1 by the end of this year			2
the full drawdown is scheduled for the end of 2014			0
but @entity41 on wednesday gave indications of an @entity40 presence in @entity1 well beyond the draw - down date			1
" i think both we and the @entity1 envision this as a very broad compact that will cover cooperation in a variety of fields " beyond 2014 , he said			2
" not only security , we 're going to talk about educational , economic and commercial cooperation			0
" the intention is to lay down the foundation ... for a strong , stable long - term relationship between our two countries			0
" @entity2 's @entity227 contributed to this report			0
