-- on friday afternoon , @entity1 was inside his summer house , a cabin on @entity5 's @entity4 , watching the @entity6 when the television broadcast was interrupted by a news flash -- a bomb had exploded in nearby @entity10			1
the bicycle race was almost over , and the 53 - year - old computer programmer clicked through other channels in an attempt to keep watching the race			1
" i was a little annoyed " they were all focused on the explosion , he told @entity0 by phone			1
but his interest picked up when he saw that the building that had borne the brunt of the blast was @entity10 's @entity24 , where his father used to work and his ex-wife and her new husband currently work			1
he texted his daughter to find out how her mother was			1
then his phone rang -- a friend who lives 22 kilometers ( 14 miles ) south of @entity10 sounded agitated			1
" he said , ' you have to get in the boat of a friend of ours and rescue people from @entity39 ( @entity4 ) , because something terrible is happening there , ' " said @entity1			1
" i thought he was joking with me			2
" but @entity1 grabbed his @entity42 and cell phone , and donned a bright - yellow jacket , a red helmet and red water - shoes to protect himself from the driving rain			1
he then ran down to the 18 - foot fishing boat , and its 50 - horsepower engine			1
the temperature outside was a brisk 15 degrees c ( 59 degrees f )			2
within 15 minutes , he was at @entity39			1
he saw people in a handful of other private boats that had lined up along the shore			2
" we saw some youngsters laying there and waving to us , " he said			2
" along the shore were children crouched behind rocks and buildings and shrubs			1
" they waved to me , " he said			2
" then i got this text message from one of my friends that said there 's a lunatic out there shooting people			2
" then he saw helicopters flying overhead			2
by now , he had realized it was no joke			2
@entity75 brought the boat along the shore and children clambered in , as many as the boat could handle without sinking			1
the children -- most of them in bathing suits or half - dressed -- were shivering			1
" of course , they were in shock , " he said			2
he observed one group of children behind rocks			1
" i tried to wave to them and to get their attention , but i did n't get a response , " he said			2
" i thought , maybe they are still in shock or laying behind that rock for shelter			2
" he understands now that they were dead			0
" they asked if i was police			0
i said , ' no , i 'm just a private person			0
our objective is to go to shore , and you will get blankets and you will find police and medical attention			0
' " then , several of them told him that a policeman had shot at them			0
he focused on the matter at hand -- promising those whom he could not accommodate that he would return soon , then motoring toward the mainland , about a half mile away			0
there , dozens of ambulances were lined up along the shore to receive them			0
" i think i made three trips , " he said			0
" they were so grateful			0
these youngsters , they said , ' thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you			0
' one girl started crying			0
" he tried to keep her from causing others to panic			0
" we have to have an agreement , " he told his passengers			0
" we should keep quiet until we get out of here			0
" he knew he 'd placed himself in a vulnerable position			0
but the danger did n't deter him			0
" i realized that me sitting there in the boat with my red helmet and yellow jacket would be a perfect target , " he recalled			1
" i thought , well , we are here and we have some things to do and i am happy that we managed to get so many of the youngsters			0
" after he had delivered his final group and could see no more children along the shore , he returned to the island where he has his summer home , opened the golf house for police to use , then went back to his cabin			1
there , he prepared a cup of coffee and some bread " and i suddenly understood what i had been through			0
" @entity75 texted his daughter that he was ok , sent a message to his sister on holiday in @entity156 and to his niece " and told her that we were doing what we had to do			0
" hours later , he considered his efforts nothing special			1
not in @entity5 , a place he said is full of calm , down - to - earth people			1
" there 's a lot of other people as well here who have done the same thing that i have done , " he said			0
" we 're pretty earth - like , grounded people			1
" " we 're just 4.7 million people			0
even in a catastrophic situation like this , we keep calm			1
i 'm just an ordinary @entity5 people			1
i expect that other @entity5 would do the same thing for me in a same or similar situation			1
" by early saturday , he was still awake -- and still did not know who had won the latest stage of the @entity6 .			0

@entity1 was watching tv on an island near @entity10 when he heard news of the bombing
he took a boat to nearby @entity39 , where he picked up children *hiding* *alongshore*
he calls his efforts nothing special , saying @entity5 are " calm " and " grounded "
