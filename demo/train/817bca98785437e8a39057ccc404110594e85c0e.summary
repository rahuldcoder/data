-- in the early 1980s when i served on the staff of the @entity4 , we invited the @entity6 deficit scourge , @entity7 , to testify on @entity8 , but he would n't come			1
somewhat understandably , he declined to sabotage his own team			0
this week , when i was asked to comment on president @entity11 's proposed " @entity10 , " i had a similar urge to duck			1
the @entity10 would increase taxes on a handful of @entity17 - like figures in today 's @entity19 , raising a few billions of dollars in new revenues each year from the very rich			1
it is perfectly tailored to the @entity11 political style , which is to nod symbolically leftward while reserving big concessions for banks , venture capitalists and insurance companies			1
symbolic gestures have their place			2
in this case , the proposed rule states an important principle of tax fairness			1
it calls attention to the larger issue of income inequality			2
it could be the start of a larger push for tax reform			2
no political progressive should sneer at an idea that helps bring these issues into focus			2
and especially not , if the direct effect might be to cost @entity17 , personally , millions of dollars			0
the image of him writing the check will , no doubt , give universal pleasure			0
another virtue of the @entity10 is that it exposes the craven hypocrisy of its opponents			1
this is , after all , a very small tax increase			2
it is exquisitely targeted on a few individuals with large investment incomes			0
as drafted by sen. @entity58 , @entity59 , it would provide a useful spur to their charity			0
there is no serious argument that the rule would make the tax code more inefficient than it already is			2
the grounds for opposing it can only be , well , craven and hypocritical			0
and yet , at the same time , by itself , the @entity10 solves no significant economic problem			1
it will not create any jobs , raise any wages , reduce the crushing debts of the middle class , slow the wave of foreclosures , conserve energy or reduce the price of gas			2
nor will it restore confidence in the banks			0
and it is directed , at least in principle , toward a notorious nonproblem , namely the deficit and the public debt , on which we waste far too much ink as things stand			0
i noticed in the news that a number of states are once again taking the lead on measures to raise the minimum wage -- with @entity100 moving toward a minimum of $ 10 per hour , and with other measures on the table in @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108			1
meanwhile sen. @entity109 , @entity110 , is pressing for the federal minimum to rise to $ 9.80 per hour by 2014			2
according to the @entity113 , @entity109 's proposal would raise the incomes of 28 million @entity19 workers			1
it would make a big difference in the @entity118 , where wages are lower			0
it would especially help younger workers , minorities and women			0
it would not add to the deficit -- since federal workers all make more than that anyway -- and would likely spur the economy and increase tax revenues -- by a lot more than the @entity10			1
i 've proposed pushing the minimum wage up to $ 12 an hour , and at least some conservatives -- the editors at @entity134 -- agree with this goal			1
( actually i took my cue from them			0
) more recently , @entity138 at the @entity139 has weighed in , calling the idea " a tougher call than i would 've thought			0
" @entity138 suggested that @entity17 could transform his campaign by endorsing it			0
that 's still possible , i suppose			0
but anyway we have a discussion and maybe even a left - right coalition -- that rarest of political birds -- getting under way			0
the @entity10 would zing a few thousand high fliers , which is not bad			1
but maybe @entity11 should go beyond symbols and grab this idea while it 's hot			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity156 .			1

*democrats* are making a case for the " @entity10 " to raise taxes on the very rich
@entity156 : while the *legislation* calls for tax fairness , it is a symbolic move
@entity156 says the @entity10 wo n't solve any significant economic problem
it 's better if president @entity11 would focus on raising the minimum wage , he says
