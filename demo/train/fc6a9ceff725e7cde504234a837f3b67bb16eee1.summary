-- it was deja vu for the @entity4 sisters at the @entity5 -- but not in a good way			1
a mouthwatering third - round clash between seven - time grand slam champion @entity8 and 17 - time major winner @entity4 was ruled out when the former lost to unseeded @entity11 @entity10 2 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 4 in early play in @entity13 on wednesday			1
then hours later , @entity4 -- also the defending champion and world @entity15 -- fell to @entity18 's @entity17 6 - 2 6 - 2 , her worst ever grand slam performance			1
in 2008 , the siblings were also defeated on the same day at @entity5 , their least productive major			1
the last time it happened was at @entity23 in 2011			0
an 18th grand slam singles crown for @entity4 would have tied her with legends @entity26 and @entity28 but the younger of the tennis playing sisters has now been upset in consecutive majors			1
@entity8 has been hindered by debilitating autoimmune disease @entity32 in recent years though she looked solid in her first round match against the promising @entity35 , @entity36			2
the siblings join other big names who 've already been upset at the tournament , including @entity43 champions @entity41 and @entity44 , as well as @entity45 and @entity46			0
defeat for @entity4 meant it was the first time in the @entity5 era that the top two women 's seeds had fallen before the third round			1
" i do n't think anything worked for me today , " a dejected @entity4 told reporters at her post-match press conference			1
" it was one of those days			0
you ca n't be on every day , and , gosh , i hate to be off during a grand slam but it happens			0
it 's not the end of the world			2
" i think she played really well and she played really smart			0
it 's great because i 'm going to go home and work five times as hard to make sure i never lose again			2
" i feel like i do n't have to win another match , i do n't have to win another tournament			0
everything and every day is a bonus for me			0
" obviously i want to do the best and i want to win and i want to be the best and that 's my whole goal			2
but it 's great sometimes to get knocked down because you have to get back up			2
i love getting back up			0
" as for @entity17 , the 20 - year - old played with precision and power , securing the biggest victory of her career to date with barely a hint of nerves			1
" ( @entity4 ) said that if i continue playing like this , i can win the tournament			1
i said , ' i will try , i will try , ' " @entity17 explained of her chat with her opponent at the net upon victory			1
" i really did n't expect that but i 'm really happy			0
i had to be aggressive and i did it well			0
@entity4 is a great champion but today is a great day for me			1
" there were no such problems for the no. 3 seed from @entity92 , @entity93 , who beat @entity96 @entity95			0
@entity97 -- the no. 7 seed from @entity99 -- disposed of @entity101 's @entity100 7 - 5 6 - 2 @entity102 , the eighth seed from @entity104 , edged past @entity106 @entity105 6 - 2 7 - 5 while the 2011 @entity110 champion @entity109 , from @entity111 , beat @entity108 's @entity107			1
the no. 12 seed , @entity113 from @entity114 , was knocked out by @entity116 's @entity115 while there were also wins for @entity118 , the 18th seed from @entity120 , and @entity18 's 14th seed @entity121			1
the top of the men 's draw did n't see any such turmoil , and two of the favorites enjoyed straight sets victories on wednesday			2
@entity130 , the no. 2 seed from @entity132 , breezed past @entity134 's @entity133 6 - 1 6 - 4 6 - 2 in just over 90 minutes			1
@entity130 is looking for his first @entity5 title and will now face @entity137 's @entity136			1
@entity138 , the 2009 champion , was also in cruise control as he dispatched @entity141 's @entity140 6 - 3 6 - 4 6 - 4			1
the no. 4 seed will face @entity99 's @entity143 in round three			1
both players sympathized with @entity41 , the @entity43 champion who was knocked out in the opening round by @entity148 outsider @entity147			1
" i understand what @entity41 is going through			0
in 2008 when i won my first grand slam , i know how that period went after that , " @entity130 told reporters			1
" it 's the first time that you have to encounter pressure or expectations of being a favorite in grand slams			2
" @entity138 also had some kind words for his compatriot , and said he was confident this would only prove a blip in his career			2
" with @entity41 , i understand where he is , because i was in such a position at a moment in my career , and it 's not even the pressure itself			0
i think it 's how you look at yourself and at your game , " the @entity35 told reporters			0
" without changing everything , this is what he 's got to work on and solve this , fix this			0
it will not happen overnight			0
" but with @entity111 , with the @entity185 , it 's in his pocket already			0
nobody can take this from him			0
it will give him time			0
" elsewhere on wednesday , there were wins for the @entity96 no. 6 seed @entity195 , @entity196 , seeded 8 from @entity120 , and @entity134 's no. 13 seed @entity197			2
