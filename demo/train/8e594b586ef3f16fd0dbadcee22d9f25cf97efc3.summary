@entity0 , @entity1 -- how did buildings keep cool before the invention of air conditioning ? as architects consider how to reduce the energy demands of new builds , some are turning to the past for simple , low - tech solutions			1
at the height of summer , in the sweltering industrial suburbs of @entity0 , @entity13 in north - west @entity1 , the @entity11 remains 20 degrees cooler inside than out -- by drawing on @entity13 's ancient architecture			1
while the exterior appears very much in keeping with the trends of contemporary design , at the base of the building is a vast pool of water -- a cooling concept taken directly from the stepwell structures developed locally over 1,500 years ago to provide refuge from the desert heat			1
award - winning architect @entity27 , who designed the academy , explains that baoli -- the @entity31 word for stepwell -- are bodies of water encased by a descending set of steps			1
" when water evaporates in heat , it immediately brings down the temperature of the space around it , " he says			2
while traditional stepwells often go many stories below ground level , @entity27 's go down just four meters			2
however , the effect is the same and -- like the ancient @entity50 palaces before it -- the academy enjoys its own microclimate			0

" how do you begin to think that you can dig into the ground and use the earth as a heat sink , have access to water , put a pavilion into it so that its comfortable through the year ? it takes a lot of technology for us to think up something that simple now			0
" but it 's not just the stepwells that are involved in this process of " passive cooling " -- the general term applied to technologies or design features that cool buildings without power consumption			2
the whole building is raised above the ground on pillars , creating an airy and shaded pavilion that is used as a recreation and exhibition space			0
here , according to @entity27 , the walls are made from a heat - absorbing material that creates a " thermal bank " -- so the warmth is slowly released at night when the temperature drops			0
centuries ago , latticed screens or " jaali " filtered direct sunlight into the palaces			0
the effect was decorative and helped reduce the heat			0
likewise at @entity100 , a latticed concrete screen runs the length of the building and provides a cooling outer skin			1
" we 've been able to demonstrate that good green building is not only cheaper to run ; it 's not only more comfortable to live in -- it 's also cheaper to build , " says @entity27			2
the success of the academy 's eco-design has had an impact			0
regulations -- based on these passive cooling techniques -- were introduced last year for all new @entity1 government buildings .			1

architect has *adapted* @entity1 's ancient stepwell architecture for a modern , sustainable building
pools of water at base create low - tech " evaporative cooling " of surrounding area
@entity11 *protected* from elements by a *double* skin , derived from traditional " jaali " structure
