-- @entity1 stunned titleholders @entity2 with a 1 - 0 victory in the first leg of their @entity6 semifinal on wednesday @entity8 international @entity7 scored the only goal of the game late in first - half injury time at a rain - swept @entity12 in west @entity13 thanks to a rare mistake by @entity2 's @entity15			1
after watching @entity17 league leaders @entity18 lose to @entity19 the night before , @entity2 had hoped to avoid any slip - ups as they attempted to defend their title			1
and the game appeared to be going their way as they dominated possession with @entity15 creating chances whenever he got on the ball			0
but the visitors were profligate in front of goal with @entity31 particularly guilty , the @entity34 international missing a hat - trick of clear - cut chances			0
as halftime approached @entity1 grew in confidence having weathered the initial storm and took a shock lead with the very last kick of the opening period			2
@entity15 's rare lapse in concentration allowed @entity45 midfielder @entity43 to career down the left wing			0
with few options in front of him @entity43 fired a low ball across the penalty box which eluded @entity2 's defense before somehow finding @entity7 lurking at the back post			1
@entity2 goalkeeper @entity55 could do little but palm the striker 's first - time shot into the back of the net			2
despite @entity2 experiencing the rare feeling of being behind at halftime , it was @entity1 that grew more comfortable as the game progressed , snuffing out the @entity66 club 's attacks with increasing confidence			1
yet deep in injury time @entity2 could have leveled the tie and score a crucial away goal , but substitute @entity71 hit the post with his low curling shot and @entity74 blazed the rebound over the bar			2
@entity1 -- controversially knocked out of the competition by a late @entity2 goal in 2009 on the same ground -- held on for a famous victory			1
" it was a great result			0
when you play @entity2 you have to do a lot of defending , just try and limit their threat and be clinical with your chances , " @entity1 's interim coach @entity82 told @entity84 network @entity83			1
@entity7 's goal turned out to be @entity1 's only shot on target in a game where @entity2 enjoyed the majority of possession : @entity1 completed 194 passes while @entity2 managed 782 , almost four times as many			1
yet the one statistic that counts is the score and for those that played in the last @entity101 semifinal in 2009 -- where @entity1 had five clear penalty claims turned down before an injury - time @entity104 goal clinched their place in the final -- the victory was sweet revenge			1
" i think we 've learned , we 've improved from three years ago			0
now we 're going to go there , have a go and try to qualify ( for the final ) , " said @entity7			0
now attention turns to the second leg at @entity2 's @entity115			2
" it 's going to be tough there , " admitted @entity7			0
" they will have opportunities			0
but we 're not in awe of them			0

@entity1 beat @entity2 1 - 0 in the @entity6 semifinal first leg
@entity7 scores the game 's only goal in *counter-attack* on halftime
*dream* of a @entity18 - @entity2 final in @entity133 is fading after both clubs ' defeats
