at first glance , the sleepy @entity1 town of @entity2 , is n't much to look at unless you 're a fan of the giant @entity6 heads and vintage water tanks being hawked outside its vintage buildings			1
and then , around a corner , everything changes			2
at the far end of a long driveway lies a colossal complex and one single word that has come to define @entity2 : museums			1
a decade ago , @entity2 was like many other ancient towns dotted around the country -- rich in history but largely forgotten			1
located just over an hour 's drive from @entity22 , the capital of @entity1 's southwestern @entity24 province , it traces its origins back to the @entity26 ( 618 - 907 ad )			1
due to a lack of industry , @entity2 would likely have remained a backwater but for local landlord @entity30 , whose legacy has driven the town 's rebirth as an historic destination			1
@entity30 and his family emerged as prominent local residents in the 1930			1
cruel tactics legend has it that he amassed tremendous wealth through cruel tactics , including forcefully taking lands from farmers and brutalizing local women			2
by the time he died in 1949 after a period of failing health , he had created an enormous 70,000 - square - meter estate			2
his family and staff also prospered in the 1930s and 40s , enabling them to build 40 connecting mansions in the center of @entity2			1
@entity30 's estate became the town 's first museum in 1958			1
each mansion boasts its own unique style , displaying the rank , importance and interests of their owners			0
a blend of @entity67 and @entity1 architectural aesthetics , they also provide insight into the remarkable period between the end of imperial @entity1 's last rulers -- the @entity71 -- and the formation of the @entity73			1
twenty seven mansions survived the turbulent years of revolution and now make up the heart of @entity2 old town , mostly in the form of hotels or restaurants			1
some have been transformed into galleries or museums dedicated to a variety of subjects , such as film , and are open to visitors			0
most , though , lie behind locked doors			0
the accessible buildings have now become a major attraction for wedding parties and mansion feasts			0
the weddings feature many obsolete local traditions			1
lavish recipes chopsticks are thrown in the air -- a gesture once thought to lead to abundant offspring -- and bejeweled swords are hung from sedan chairs for luck			0
some couples come just to have their wedding photos taken			0
mansion feasts , meanwhile , showcase lavish recipes created by chefs who cooked exclusively for the owners of the @entity2 's large houses and passed down through generations			1
a spicy duck feet salad is said to be the invention of one of @entity30 's wives			2
despite its colourful history , @entity2 did n't evolve as a museum town until @entity118 , a real estate developer - turned - collector - and - curator , decided to open a private museum here in 2003			1
fan had acquired land in @entity2 through auction and decided that it would be the perfect spot to house his large collection of revolution memorabilia			1
it transformed the area into the @entity133 cluster			0
opened to the public in 2005 , it 's still a growing project			2
ghost town there are currently 24 exhibition spaces open , covering 100,000 square meters ( 1.1 million square feet ) and housing more than eight million items including historical artefacts , commissioned artworks and reproduced photographs , themed around the @entity144 , the @entity146 - era , @entity1 culture and the 2008 @entity24 earthquake			1
when @entity22 's government announced in 2009 that it would invest $ 820 million to transform @entity2 into an internationally renowned museum town , its fate was further sealed			1
later that year , @entity1 's @entity152 and the @entity153 awarded @entity2 the title of " @entity1 's @entity155			1
" @entity157 , this new identity has done little to change @entity2 's appearance as a ghost town populated only by artefacts			1
come saturdays , sundays and holidays , however , it 's a bustling tourist spot bathed in a sea of visitors			2
here are the main attractions : @entity166 while most sites are ticketed , there are a few installations that are free to view such as the @entity170 of the veterans of @entity1			1
ticketed exhibits follow themes -- there 's the @entity175 , the @entity176 , the @entity177 and the @entity178			2
the vast collections can be a bit overwhelming so it can be worth focusing on the highlights			0
in the @entity175 , the @entity183 tells the stories of @entity1 pows through a series of photographs			1
there are also three floors of artifacts at the @entity191 , focusing on individuals in the @entity144			0
the @entity176 contains the most distinctive exhibits			0
a maze of decorative looking glasses adorns the @entity196 of the @entity197			0
there are also thousands of unique pieces on display in the @entity201 that explore how the aesthetic style of porcelain changed between the 1950s to the 1980s			2
the @entity177 and the @entity178 are smaller			0
the @entity204 relates harrowing tales from 2008 @entity24 earthquake survivors and their rescuers			1
the @entity208 features adult footwear measuring just four inches long			0
access to all the museums costs rmb $ 100 ( $ 16 ) and tickets are valid for three days			0
individual museums costs rmb $ 20 ( $ 3 ) to enter			0
other ticket options are also available			0
@entity216 estates the estates are split into four main areas : the @entity218 , @entity216 's @entity219 , @entity220 and @entity221			2
@entity218 is the house where @entity30 lived with his close relatives			0
highlights include their intricately carved door frames and beds			0
the @entity220 is is now home to the items that once sat in the now mostly bare rooms of the @entity218			0
visit to all of the areas on site costs rmb $ 50 ( $ 8 ) but there are also separate tickets for individual areas			0
@entity2 's @entity234 dominating the center of the old town , along @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 and @entity240 , are @entity2 's @entity234			1
many of these are now restaurants , boutique hotels or cafes with varying appeal to just - visiting tourists			0
the buildings are still well - preserved and the interiors are often in keeping with the era so it 's worth having a peek at some of the architecture and murals on the walls			2
there are also numerous vintage film posters on the walls in this part of town			2
the @entity262 is free to enter but tickets to movie showings cost rmb $ 10 ( $ 1.6 )			0
there 's about 5,000 old films at the museum , so you never know what you might be watching			2
galleries , mostly displaying traditional art , are free to enter .			0
