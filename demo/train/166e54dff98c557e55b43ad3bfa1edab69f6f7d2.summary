-- a foiled plot to sneak a bomb through airport checkpoints and onto a plane bound for the @entity5 calls attention to gaps in screening measures that are supposed to detect threats airport metal detectors @entity10 outside the @entity5 , the controversial body - scanning technology is not widely used , security experts say			1
but they say it is the best way to detect plastic explosives hidden on people boarding airplanes			1
" since most of these airports are not using body - scanning technology , including for @entity5 flights , i would say that this is an opening that was probably intended to be abused by ( the bomb - maker ) and those who planned the attack , " said @entity17 , president of @entity18 and former head of security of @entity21 in @entity22			1
the latest nonmetallic bomb to be discovered never made it to an airport and posed no real threat to air travelers			0
it is similar to , but more sophisticated than , the device discovered in a failed attempt to bring down a @entity40 - bound airliner on christmas day in 2009			1
new sophistication seen in bomb plot , lawmaker says that attempt hastened deployment in the @entity5 of advanced imaging technology , or body scanning , at airport security checkpoints across the country			1
there are about 700 machines in more than 180 airports nationwide			0
pat - downs are used when passengers decline body screening or when a scan reveals a need for additional screening			1
" it 's not a perfect technology , and there are several ways that it can be bypassed , " @entity17 said			2
" but at the same time , it is the best technology that we have available at this time			2
" homeland security secretary @entity65 said there is a " high likelihood " the latest bomb would have been detected if attempts had been made to slip it past @entity5 airport security			2
use of advanced imaging technology abroad is " woefully inadequate , " said @entity74 , a former @entity75 and @entity76 official and co-founder of the @entity78 , a security firm that has worked with clients that manufacture advanced imaging devices			1
" in order to be optimally effective , we ca n't have gaping holes that terrorists can exploit , " @entity74 said			1
in addition to the 700 scanners employed by the @entity5 , @entity86 has about 50 , @entity85 is planning to install machines in july , and the technology is in use at @entity92 's @entity92 and in the @entity93 , according to @entity94			2
the council said there is no central repository tracking the use of the technology worldwide			2
a spokesman for the @entity101 also was unaware of exact figures and locations of the machines but said it is not a common screening method outside the @entity5 " we 're not suggesting that ( advanced imaging ) is the magic bullet			0
it 's one of many layers of technology , processes and people needed for a multilayered defense , " @entity74 said			2
he said the @entity5 should step up deployment of the technology and increase the use of behavioral detection officers and bomb - detecting dogs in airports as well as employ additional analysis of passenger data before travelers even arrive at the airport			1
carrying on with that layered , risk - based approach to security is exactly what the @entity76 is doing in response to the latest threat , the agency said			1
" these layers include threat and vulnerability analysis , prescreening and screening of passengers , using the best available technology , random searches at airports , federal air marshal coverage and additional security measures both seen and unseen , " the agency said in a statement			1
the use of intelligence to head off threats before they reach the critical airport screening stage " has been proven very successful in this instance , " @entity17 said			2
" on that level , i think we have already established a good foothold			0
" rep. @entity152 , the chairman of the @entity153 , said it is too soon to say whether the latest plot will lead to more stringent security measures			2
" i 'm not sure we 're there yet , " he said			0
" preliminarily , many believe that you wo n't have to have anything different than we have right now			0
the systems in place would have detected this			0
that 's the good news			0
the bad news is a lot of people do n't like the systems in place at the @entity171			0
" and those systems have been widely criticized by privacy advocates in the @entity5 and abroad			1
in @entity175 , privacy concerns have long delayed implementation of body scanning technology			1
international airports with direct flights to the @entity5 are required to meet @entity181 security standards and some @entity171 requirements , but the use of advanced imaging machines is at the discretion of each country			0
even in the unlikely event of global adoption of body scanning , the technology has its limitations			1
the machines are not designed to detect explosive devices concealed inside the human body , and the @entity76 has identified some " vulnerabilities " in the screening process , according to a summary of classified advanced imaging testing published in november			1
the office made eight recommendations that the @entity171 agreed to as a result of the testing			0
details of those recommendations are classified			0
in march 2010 , the @entity205 said that " while officials said ( advanced imaging technologies ) performed as well as physical pat downs in operational tests , it remains unclear whether the @entity210 would have detected the weapon used in the december 2009 incident based on the preliminary information @entity205 has received , " noting that the results of the @entity171 's testing are classified			0
no magic bullet , indeed			0
what remains clear is the need for a security strategy that evolves quickly , officials say			0
" every time we think we have them , they come up with something new , " said @entity222 chairman rep. @entity221 , @entity224 - @entity223 .			0
