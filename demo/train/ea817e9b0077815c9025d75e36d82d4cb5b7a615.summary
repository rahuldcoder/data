the discovery of the tail of @entity2 has fueled hopes that searchers may be close to recovering the plane 's crucial black boxes			1
the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder are considered to be vital elements in figuring out the causes of commercial aviation disasters			1
@entity14 's top search and rescue official says searchers are now " striving " to find the black boxes ( which are actually orange )			1
here 's the lowdown on the devices , the information they are likely to hold and how investigators will go about extracting it			1
what do black boxes contain ? the two devices hold different kinds of information			1
the cockpit voice recorder contains " every audio sound that occurs on the flight deck , " said @entity30 , an aviation safety expert			1
that can include things like conversation between the pilots , warning sounds from the plane 's systems and even hail hitting the windshield			1
" it 'll have the sound of the flight attendant providing a cup of coffee to the pilot if that occurred on the flight , " @entity30 , a former pilot , told @entity3			1
" everything that happened will be recorded			2
" the flight data recorder is a different beast			1
it stores a huge amount of information about the plane 's performance			2
" the flight data recorder will provide information about all aspects about what was happening with the aircraft when the disaster occurred -- everything from speed , to altitude , to the individual settings of instruments , " said @entity54 , the managing editor of @entity55 , an aviation industry website			1
" it 'll give a very detailed picture of what was going on last sunday when this crash happened , " he told @entity3			1
where are they ? in the @entity76 , the aircraft in question , the two flight recorders are housed in the tail			1
that has led to hopes that they could be within the grasp of the divers who took pictures of the tail section at the bottom of the @entity85 on wednesday			2
@entity30 suggested that getting them out of the wreckage should n't be too tricky			2
" if they have the tail and they have a few tools with them , they should be able to take those recorders out of the tail section without even having to raise the tail section to the surface , " he said			2
" it 's not that hard			2
it 's done all the time for maintenance on the ground			2
" but the divers have to contend with murky waters and strong currents as they search the wreckage			2
removing the flight recorders " would be similar to removing a hard drive from a damaged computer , " @entity106 said			1
" it 's something that you 'd want to do very carefully , very slowly and very deliberately			2
" and @entity113 chief executive @entity112 raised the issue of whether the piece of wreckage found by the search teams is the exact part of the tail containing the black boxes			2
" i am led to believe the tail section has been found , " he tweeted			2
" if right part of tail section then the black box should be there			0
" what if they 're not in the tail ? @entity106 flagged the concern that the flight recorders may have got separated from the tail of the plane as the aircraft came down , noting that officials have n't reported detecting any pings from the devices ' locator beacons			1
" they might have fallen free , which could create some issues , " he said			0
but even if the black boxes are no longer attached to the tail , @entity106 said he thought searchers would probably find them within a matter of days or weeks			0
@entity147 , a former managing director of the @entity148 ( @entity148 ) , said flight recorders can be difficult to pinpoint , even if they have locator beacons			1
" the black boxes often become covered with silt and covered with metal			0
you have got to be directly over them , " he said			0
" it is hard to find something in the ocean			0
it took us days to find the black boxes at @entity162			0
we were right over it			0
the pingers , we never picked up			0
" the batteries powering @entity2 's pingers are estimated to have around 20 days of power left			0
will the black boxes have all the answers ? experts seem optimistic that they will			0
" we 're talking almost 100 % certainty that we will get all the answers from those two boxes , " @entity30 said			0
" if the two pilots have been discussing the issue and they 're talking about the problem they 've got , that will tell a lot almost immediately , " he told @entity3			1
" the flight data recorder will tell all the speeds , the rate of descent , the cabin pressure -- everything that has basically gone wrong in the final moments of that flight will be evident			1
" black boxes do n't provide the whole picture for aviation accident investigators , though			1
@entity189 , a former @entity191 safety inspector , likens the process to " peeling an onion apart and then putting that onion back together from the inside out			0
" investigators map the debris found on the surface of the water			0
then , they have to look for other pieces in the next level of sea for more clues , he said			0
" so you might go down 50 feet or so , to see if there 's any floating debris there , " said @entity189 , an aviation analyst for @entity3			1
" and you keep going down and mapping it as it goes			0
you see how the drift went and how the pieces of the plane moved			0
" during the investigation of @entity220 , more than 150,000 images of the plane 's wreckage site in the @entity218 were taken			0
it was important to " mosaic them together " to give investigators a comprehensive view of the wreckage site , said @entity226 , who co-led that search after the @entity229 jet crashed in 2009			1
how long will the investigation take ? if they are recovered , the black boxes will be taken to a lab in @entity233 to be analyzed , according to @entity14 's @entity234 ( @entity235 ) , which is leading the investigation into the disaster			0
" there will be a very careful , methodical process by which these things are opened up and by which the data is extracted , " @entity106 said			1
" this process is filmed , there 'll be officials on hand			0
so it 's kind of a long process			0
" the flight data recorder requires special software to retrieve the reams of data it contains			1
the @entity235 's final report into @entity255 -- which crashed in @entity14 waters on @entity257 , 2007 , killing all 102 people on board -- came out more than a year after the disaster			0
the report on @entity262 is likely to take at least year to cover all the different angles , according to @entity30			0
" it requires a lot of analysis and a lot of background - checking , as well , " he said			0
@entity3 's @entity269 contributed to this report .			1
