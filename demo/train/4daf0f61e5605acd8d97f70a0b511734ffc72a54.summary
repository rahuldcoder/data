@entity0 -- @entity3 's recent crackdown on corruption has netted a growing number of high - profile officials , often through campaigns that began with the posting of rumors and incriminating photos on social media			1
but those same campaigns are also exposing a seedier side of social media , which has become a tool for opportunistic reporters , bloggers , and crime syndicates to engage in vindictive rumor - mongering and even extortion			1
the opportunists and vigilantes alike have thrived by using the nation 's increasingly influential social media platforms -- most notably the @entity26 - like @entity25 -- in the name of rooting out corruption under an austerity campaign by @entity3 's new leaders			1
while many of the resulting smear campaigns are based on genuine corruption , some are also clearly motivated by personal gain			0
such smear campaigns would have much more difficulty gaining traction in the @entity38 , where traditional media play a more effective watchdog role over issues like government corruption			1
but with @entity3 's state - owned media often muzzled by local interests from reporting corruption , decentralized and privately - owned social media platforms are more effective			1
one of the earliest and most famous corruption scandals uncovered by netizens occurred in 2011 , involving a young woman named @entity49 who claimed to work for a @entity51 affiliate on her @entity25 account while posting photos of herself with luxury cars and designer goods			2
her lavish lifestyle led to a public outcry over what appeared to be abuses of charity funding			0
@entity49 quickly apologized for her " ignorant behavior " on her @entity25 account			0
the @entity51 also conducted its own investigation and found @entity49 had no connection to the organization			0
but other instances of mismanagement were later uncovered , and general skepticism toward charities seriously damaged the @entity51 ' reputation and ability to raise funds in @entity3			1
two years later , the organization 's reputation remains in tatters			0
last week , the bribery trial of the " sex - tape official " @entity75 opened			0
a former @entity79 city official , @entity75 's downfall began last year with the online posting of a graphic video of him having sex with a mistress			0
the woman was later revealed to have colluded with a property developer to lure @entity75 into a " honey trap " to extort him for money or favorable business contracts			0
@entity75 argued in court that the 3 million yuan ( us $ 488,000 ) loan he helped the property developer secure should not be interpreted as a bribe			0
in more recent cases , incriminating photos led to the downfall of government officials for such transgressions as owning too many luxury watches and hosting overly lavish banquets at taxpayer expense			2
in many of these cases , the officials in question were already found guilty in the court of public opinion before any legal proceedings began , and anything they said in defense was largely ignored			2
in april , police in the central @entity3 city of @entity112 reportedly broke up a crime ring of 80 people who posed as journalists and threatened to write negative stories about people who refused to pay hush money			1
such extortion has become common even among genuine media			1
an acquaintance at a major @entity3 - @entity123 joint venture recently complained to me that she was forced to buy advertising from a newspaper after a reporter threatened to write a negative story if she did not pay up			2
the government is aware of these growing problems of vindictive rumor - mongering and extortion and is trying to take steps to fix them			2
the official @entity134 news agency reported in may that six people were charged for secretly taping illicit sex videos of officials in @entity79 from 2008 to 2009 and trying to extort the officials afterward			2
the @entity140 's official newspaper , @entity139 , also ran an editorial last month saying that spurned mistresses may not be reliable whistle - blowers in corruption cases			0
in addition to prosecuting extortionists , the government has also taken steps to bring order to @entity3 's unruly social media platforms , where scandalous messages can often go viral in a matter of hours			1
more than a year ago , the government announced a controversial new policy requiring all social media users to register with their real names			1
it said the move was designed to eliminate the cloak of anonymity enjoyed by rumor - mongerers , although many critics feared the policy was designed to limit free speech			0
social media platforms themselves have also taken their own steps to make their users more accountable			1
last year , @entity25 rolled out a user rating system whereby each user is rated on a scale of 10 , with 1 being the least reliable and 10 the most trustworthy			0
the posting and spreading of unfounded rumors lowers a user 's rating			0
the most obvious solution to these problems would be greater freedom for traditional media , which would relieve social media vigilantes of their unreliable role as government watchdogs			1
but in the absence of such liberalization , the @entity3 government and private internet operators will be forced to find new and innovative ways to ensure the quality of material posted on their sites .			2

many corrupt officials in @entity3 exposed by vigilantes on social media
but opportunists also using social media in extortion schemes against officials
