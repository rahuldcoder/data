-- officials in @entity2 said monday they are investigating the " suspicious " death of a 3 - year - old boy , adopted from @entity5 , and a @entity5 official blamed the death on " inhuman abuse			1
" the boy was born on january 9 , 2010 , and died on january 21 , 2013 , according to @entity10 , the @entity11 's special representative for human rights			1
" i would like to draw your attention to another case of inhuman abuse of a @entity5 child by @entity20 adoptive parents , " he said in a statement			1
@entity10 claimed the child suffered injuries to his head and legs , as well as to his abdomen and internal organs			0
the wounds , he said , " could only be caused by strong blows			0
" @entity28 , an investigator with the @entity30 's office , said the case was referred to his office because of the " suspicious " nature of the child 's death			0
@entity36 , of @entity37 , said his office is investigating			0
the allegations include physical abuse and neglectful supervision , or neglect , he said			2
sgt. @entity42 , spokesman for the @entity43 , said his office is also investigating			0
no arrests have been made , and officials are waiting for autopsy results , he said			0
a call seeking comment to a number listed for the boy 's adoptive parents was not immediately returned			1
a voice message told reporters the parents would have no comment			0
the child 's death comes amid tension between the @entity20 and @entity5 over adoptions			1
@entity61 spokeswoman @entity60 said monday that officials are aware of the case			0
" the @entity61 takes very seriously the welfare of children , particularly children who have been adopted from other countries , " she said			0
" we will continue to assist the @entity69 and consulate officials in making contact with the appropriate authorities in @entity2			2
" in december , @entity5 president @entity73 signed into law a measure that would ban the adoption of @entity5 children by @entity20 families			1
it is scheduled to take effect in january			0
the action could affect hundreds of @entity20 families seeking to adopt. @entity20 adopted close to 1,000 @entity5 children last year , according to @entity61 figures			1
though the number has been dropping in recent years , @entity5 remains the third most popular foreign country -- after @entity87 and @entity88 -- for @entity20 foreign adoptions			1
the @entity5 measure also bars any political activities by nongovernmental organizations receiving funding from the @entity20 , if such activities could affect @entity5 interests , @entity5 's semiofficial @entity90 news agency said			1
and it imposes sanctions against @entity20 officials thought to have violated human rights			2
the move is widely seen as retaliation for a bill that @entity20 president @entity104 signed into law on december 14			2
that law , called the @entity107 , imposes @entity20 travel and financial restrictions on human rights abusers in @entity5			1
the @entity107 is named for @entity5 lawyer @entity111 , who uncovered the largest tax fraud in the country 's history in the form of rebates claimed by government officials who stole money from the state			2
@entity111 was apparently beaten to death in 2009 after a year in a @entity122 detention center			2
backers of the @entity5 bill said @entity20 adoptive parents have been abusive , citing what they say are 19 deaths of adopted @entity5 children since the 1990s			1
the @entity5 public supported the bill , with 56 % of respondents in a poll conducted by the @entity132 ( @entity133 ) saying they backed the ban , @entity90 reported			0
in 2010 , an @entity20 woman sparked outrage after she sent her adopted son back to @entity5 alone on a one - way flight , saying the boy , then 7 , had violent episodes that made her family fear for its safety			1
@entity0 's @entity143 and @entity144 contributed to this report .			0
