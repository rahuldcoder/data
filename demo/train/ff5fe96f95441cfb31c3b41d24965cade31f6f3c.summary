-- @entity1 and @entity2 have finally found something they can agree on			1
@entity5 and @entity6 , an @entity1 and @entity2 doubles team , made it to the men 's doubles finals in the @entity11			1
on friday afternoon , the 16th - seeded pair lost to the top - seeded @entity13 and @entity14 , an @entity16 team of identical twins			1
this unlikely pair , dubbed the @entity19 , has become a symbol of pride for both nations			2
@entity6 , from @entity2 , says he can see it in the fans who come to watch			1
" it was great to see all the @entity1 supporters , most of them wearing @entity2 flags on their faces , holding @entity2 flags and cheering for the same team , " he said			1
" that 's a moment i will never forget in my life , meeting so many @entity1 supporting us			2
" @entity1 and @entity2 have been bitter foes since their creation in 1947 , fighting three wars over the disputed territory of @entity39 and routinely exchanging fire over the border			1
@entity5 and @entity6 hope they can ease these tense relations with their message of peace through sport			1
at @entity48 this year , the team sported t - shirts and jackets with the message " @entity52 , @entity53			0
" the pair has even proposed playing a match at the @entity57 border crossing between @entity1 and @entity2			2
" and just looking at the bigger picture , i just feel if me , as a @entity2 , and him , as an @entity1 , can do so well on the court and be friends off the court , there 's no other reason why those @entity1 and @entity2 ca n't be friends , " @entity6 said in an interview with @entity0			1
friends say they also carry this spirit of peace and cooperation with them off the court			0
" they understand each other , speak the same language , their games complement each other , " said @entity72 , a former @entity73 player			0
they have chemistry , key to winning doubles matches , @entity72 said			0
in the audience at wednesday 's match was another unlikely pair : the @entity86 ambassadors from @entity1 and @entity2 , cheering on the @entity19 -- together			1
this is the type of cooperation and progress that @entity5 and @entity6 hope to encourage			1
this chemistry has allowed @entity5 and @entity6 to upset several teams during the tournament			1
in round 3 of the @entity11 , the pair beat no. 2 - seeded @entity95 of @entity96 and @entity97 of @entity98			0
@entity5 and @entity6 went on in the quarterfinals to beat 10th - seeded @entity100 of @entity101 and @entity102 of @entity103			2
and on wednesday , the pair beat unseeded @entity105 and @entity106 of @entity107			0
@entity5 hopes they can get their message to their home nations by playing well at the tournament			2
" i think it 's really about practicing well and then working as a team together , and i think that 's the main key , just believing in each other , " he said			0
the run to the finals in @entity118 is sure to generate publicity at home			0
but the pair wo n't be talking politics			0
" you ca n't mix politics , religion or culture with sports , " @entity6 said			0
" that 's the beauty about it			0
" there 's only one thing that the two players do n't agree on , and it has little to do with cross-border differences			0
@entity5 likes spicy food ; @entity6 most certainly does n't .			2
