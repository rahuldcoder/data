-- over the years , it seems that just about every format imaginable has been used for debates between presidential candidates			1
@entity8 stages to walk around on			2
moderators working solo , like @entity10 at this year 's first presidential debate and @entity12 at the vice presidential debate			1
moderators with panels of reporters			2
questions submitted by the audience			2
questions submitted by viewers at home			2
town halls , like the one that will be moderated by @entity0 's @entity25 on tuesday			2
yet , 52 years after the first televised presidential debate , there still often seems something stilted and dry about some of them ( but not all : witness last week 's high - energy vice presidential debate between @entity32 and @entity33 )			1
frequently , though , the staffs of the people running for the presidency negotiate the ground rules so fussily that the debates can at times feel like some sort of candidates ' cotillion			1
so what if , for one debate some year , it was agreed to try the one format that has not been tested ? the debate would still be 90 minutes in prime evening time			1
the proceedings would still be telecast live on all the networks			2
there would still be an audience in the auditorium			0
but there would be no moderator , and no panel of questioners			1
there would be no subject matter agreed to in advance			0
there would be no rules			0
at the top of the hour , the two candidates would come out onto the stage			1
there would n't even need to be an announcer making an introduction			0
... it would be up to them			0
they would have 90 minutes to talk to the audience , and to each other			0
to argue , and try to persuade , with no referee			0
it just might be fascinating			0
their staffs , as campaign staffs will do , would have prepared them and would have come up with tactics for each of them to take over the debate			1
and you can bet that the two candidates would fall back on those rehearsed tactics			1
but then they would realize that , with 75 or so minutes left , they had better figure out a way to talk about things with each other , and with the nation			0
it would be like when people get stuck in an elevator together : they talk because they have to			0
they may feel that they have nothing in common , but now they 're here			0
in the elevator suspended between floors , there 's no one but the two of them			0
surprising things can be said and learned			0
if a presidential debate of this sort were to be attempted , the audience in the auditorium , and at home , might find out some things about the candidates they would never discern in a tightly formatted , moderated debate , or in a standard - issue stump speech			1
and the candidates might find out a few things about each other -- maybe even find some unanticipated common ground			1
funny things can happen in an elevator that is n't going anywhere			0
some of what unfolds might have little to do with the specific words that are spoken			0
is one of the candidates overbearing and selfish in how he uses the time -- does he refuse to let his opponent get a word in ? that would be a good thing for the voters to know			1
is one of the candidates lighthearted and easygoing as he deals with the empty minutes in the company of the person he is running against ? that would be instructive to see			1
who 's the leader ? who heats up ? who is unflappable ? there are , after all , occasions when presidents meet one - on - one with powerful foreign leaders , with no one to guide the conversation			0
this might be a good approximation of that -- presidential candidates unplugged , on their own , with no escape hatch			1
( or the debate might instead turn out to be an approximation of a pro-wrestling cage match , in suits and ties instead of trunks			2
) of course , once candidates took part in one debate with this format , they and their staffs would undoubtedly devise a way to screw it up for the next time , to make it bland and suck all the life out of it			1
but for one night -- that first night it was tried -- it just might make for great , riveting viewing			2
or -- let 's be candid -- it might turn out to be an utter flop , like the announcerless @entity182 telecast that took place in 1980 , when @entity184 , as an experiment , put on a regular - season game between the @entity187 and @entity188 with no announcers or commentators -- just the sights and sounds of the action			2
the post-game consensus was that it was n't such a splendid idea at all			0
but two candidates , stuck in the presidential - debate elevator , depending on their own wits , intelligence and deeply held beliefs to carry the night ? with just the two of them to figure it all out , and the entire nation watching ? there is at least a chance that it could develop into one of the most spontaneous and illuminating evenings of politics ever televised			1
there 's only one way to find out			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .			1

@entity214 : presidential debates have tried all kinds of formats
he *suggests* a debate between two candidates -- with no moderator
