-- a man shot up a federal courthouse and a @entity6 consulate -- which he also seemingly tried to set ablaze -- in @entity7 , @entity8 , early friday before being shot dead outside police headquarters , that city 's police chief said			1
the shooter fired " over 100 rounds " in a roughly 10 - minute span , but he did not hit anyone even though the bullets ricocheted at a typically busy time in downtown @entity7 , when streets fill with people after bars close for the night			1
" this thanksgiving ... weekend , i give thanks that no one but the suspect is injured or deceased , " police chief @entity19 said			1
" that 's something that we should all take a lot of comfort in			0
" the shooter was identified in a tweet from @entity7 police as 49 - year - old @entity32 @entity19 said he was an @entity7 resident who had a criminal history			1
authorities have not offered a motive , but the police chief said that the shooter 's " violent anti-government behavior " -- as evidenced by attacking buildings that belong to @entity6 's government , the @entity44 government and , in the police headquarters , the city government -- may have come from ongoing and often vitriolic debates in society			1
" our political discourse has become very heated and sometimes very angry , and sometimes the rhetoric is not healthy , " @entity19 said , adding that the divisive immigration debate " comes to mind , " given that the federal courthouse and @entity6 consulate were targeted			1
" i would venture , based on my training and experience , that the political rhetoric might have fed into some of this			1
" the first 911 calls about gunshots came in at 2:22 a.m. friday , with some reporting a " possible automatic weapon being fired " a few minutes later			0
very soon after that , police started to hear about gunfire near a recently opened federal courthouse and then at the city 's nearby @entity6 consulate			2
@entity19 later said the suspect -- using small cylinders often used for camping -- is thought to have ignited a fire at the consulate , though those flames were extinguished before any extensive damage was done			0
the police headquarters " came under attack " about 2:32 a.m. , @entity19 said , at which time a sergeant with the department 's mounted police unit happened to be outside , putting away horses			1
" as he held two horses with one hand , he discharged ... at least one round with a single - handed shot , " the chief said			1
" that would have been one heck of a shot			2
so part of our investigation will be whether the suspect died from our gunshot , from a self - inflicted gunshot or from a combination of both			2
" after the gunman went down , officers spotted " suspicious cylinders " inside his van			2
and when they dragged the gunman away , officers noticed " some type of vest on the suspect " -- something that @entity19 said could have been " simply a protective vest or potentially an ied suicide - type vest that is known to be used around the world			2
" authorities immediately called in the bomb squad and closed off the surrounding area , including for a time stopping all traffic on a stretch of @entity115			0
a few hours later , they determined there were no explosives at the site			0
the suspect 's residence " has been secured and is safe , " according to @entity19 's twitter account			0
@entity19 said that investigators , including @entity126 agents , " will be looking at everything , " even social media accounts , to try to determine what the gunman was thinking			0
the chief also said that he hopes the incident -- coming at a time of much - publicized , deep - seated anger at police after a @entity137 grand jury 's decision not to charge a @entity139 police officer in the fatal shooting of @entity141 -- prompts people to think about the dangers that police face , and overcome , every day to keep residents safe			1
" we are under siege at times , " @entity19 said			0
" and it 's important for people to realize that the men and women in this profession are ( the public 's defense ) when it comes to ... any type of threat , from terrorists or the common criminal			0
" @entity0 's @entity161 and @entity162 contributed to this report .			0
