-- what rules must a turkey sandwich follow in order to board an airplane ? with the six needles found in sandwiches on four international @entity9 flights from the @entity10 to the @entity11 , it 's a question already stressed travelers are starting to ask			1
assuming you get any food on your flight these days , how do you know it 's safe to eat ? each country is responsible for setting its own in - flight catering rules , says @entity21 , a spokesman for the @entity22 , an airline industry group			1
the @entity24 ' @entity23 also has standards and guidance on catering security			1
the @entity29 declined to specify its catering rules " so as to not violate the integrity of these measures , " @entity29 spokesman @entity28 wrote in an e-mail			1
" @entity29 conducts ongoing inspections to ensure airlines and contractors comply with these security requirements			1
" at foreign airports , the @entity29 's role " is as an evaluator of those programs			0
" tainted food : a sticky situation for airline travelers none of the @entity11 airlines contacted by @entity0 , including @entity9 , would comment on specifics of how food moves from manufacturing plants and commercial food kitchens to their airplanes			1
nor would two of the largest airline catering companies , including @entity53 , which supplied the turkey sandwiches under investigation			1
@entity53 said it is " cooperating fully with investigations by local and federal authorities and by our customer			0
as such , further details of this matter must remain confidential " and referred to its website for information on safety procedures			1
to learn more , @entity0 turned to @entity66 , a professor with a specialty in airline catering at the @entity70 's @entity69 in @entity71			1
the following is a transcript of that interview , edited and condensed for clarity : @entity0 : what threats does a company screen for ? @entity66 : random sampling of food items is to test for pathogenic organisms to ensure against food poisoning			1
visual inspection of trays and trolleys is just for quality assurance purposes rather than to protect against threats			2
x-ray is designed to reveal weapons and bombs			0
@entity0 : is every food item that goes on a plane screened ? or do catering companies and government agencies do spot inspections ? @entity66 : spot testing and inspection ( are conducted ) mostly by supervisors , rarely by outside agencies			1
three things could be screened -- the items put on the tray ; the tray once it is laid up ; and the trolleys once they are full of trays			0
in most cases across the world , such screening is simply visual and random sampling			0
in some high - threat countries ( for example , in the @entity111 ) trolleys are x-rayed ( like luggage is ) , but this is not commonplace			2
@entity0 : what is done when an apparently deliberate act of malice is discovered ? @entity66 : such an isolated , one - off incident like this is extremely difficult to prevent			1
it could happen not just in a flight kitchen but in any food preparation operation , where a malicious person could tamper with food			2
in this instance , it is likely that the sandwiches would be labeled and coded so that it would be known when they were made , and possibly by whom			0
the most likely perpetrator is the employee who made the sandwiches , but this is not necessarily the case			0
the needles could have been inserted after the product was made and packaged -- during transportation to the plane			0
close inspection of the packaging will reveal this ( and the loaders will be known )			2
it is also possible that the needles were placed in the products used to make the sandwiches ( the bread and filling ) , further up the supply chain			0
this is less likely as the sandwich maker should have detected such tampering			0
again close examination is likely to reveal if this were the case			0
such analysis narrows down who might have done the tampering , and hence further steps can be taken to monitor the suspects and potentially prove their guilt			0
@entity0 : will airlines or their caterers change any procedures as a result of this incident ? @entity66 : neither the airline nor flight caterer will change their suppliers because of this one incident			1
millions of airline meals get served every day and billions in a year			2
hence the likelihood of this happening is the equivalent of winning the lottery or aliens landing in @entity172			0
no system is completely risk - free and to suggest that this , or any other incident like it , can be completely eliminated is fantasy			2
you are probably 100 times more likely to die in a plane crash than eat contaminated food on a plane			2
@entity0 's @entity182 and @entity183 contributed to this report .			0

airlines and caterers have *shared* few details about food inspection on planes
airline catering usually spot tested , **expert** says
**expert** : isolated , one - off incidents such as recent @entity9 *episode* are difficult to prevent
