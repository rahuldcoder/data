-- @entity1 might be an unassuming character -- but he 's also a tech titan who reinvented the way the world communicates			1
and now he 's on a mission to do the same for commerce			0
the co-founder of @entity10 and chief executive officer of @entity12 met with @entity0 's @entity13 to share his vision on how mobile payments will change the world of commerce			1
@entity12 , which enables the virtual exchange of cash and goods , is designed to " give time back to our sellers , give time back to our merchants , so they can really focus on building their business up , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
" we do n't want this to just be about payments , we do n't want it to be about transactions -- those are all mechanical things that should be so intuitive that they disappear , " he said			0
@entity1 is criss - crossing @entity34 to promote @entity12 and talk to small business owners , whom he sees as key to reinvigorating economic growth			2
" what i think is great about technology , and every technology that exists , [ is that ] it increases the number of people who can participate , in our case commerce , " @entity1 said			2
" and , it increases the velocity that they can participate			0
" @entity12 , @entity1 added , enables a businessperson to " start as an individual , you can start selling something , and then you can grow			1
" @entity12 is competing in a jammed arena -- mobile payments already exist via @entity55 and others -- but @entity1 told @entity0 its pitch is different			1
" a lot of folks are looking at parts of the equation and @entity12 is looking at the entire thing , " @entity1 said			1
" if you 're not solving for the entire experience , you are putting those seams in front of the customers -- and the customers see that			0
and they have all these friction points , and it actually slows down the business			0
" @entity12 aims to have " one , end - to - end , great , frictionless experience -- and that 's been our focus from day one , " @entity1 said			2
transactions through @entity12 have tripled over the last 18 months , a success that nevertheless remains overshadowed by the @entity1 's involvement in @entity10			1
the micro-messaging social network , which has shifted how people and businesses communicate , is valued at up to $ 11 billion and will go public next month			1
however , @entity1 said @entity12 is an " entirely new canvas , " dealing as it does with commerce rather than communication			2
both ideas are " fundamental to humanity ...			0
both are extremely complex and both companies are trying to make each simple			0
" but , @entity1 added , " they are very very different problem sets and they require different solutions to each one			0

@entity10 co-founder @entity1 is now *ceo* of a mobile payments company
*square* enables the virtual exchange of cash and goods
@entity1 told @entity104 makes the entire process *seamless* , rather than just aspects of it
his comments come as social network @entity10 , valued at $ 11 billion , prepares to go public
