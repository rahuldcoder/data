@entity0 -- bamboozled by eurozone debt crisis jargon ? @entity1 is here to help you tell your bond yields from your banking interventions , your defaults from your haircuts			1
and if you need anything more explained , please submit your questions to @entity10 at the bottom of the story			2
@entity13 the euro is the common currency used by a bloc of nations within the @entity18			2
the 17 states that use the euro -- including @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 -- form the eurozone			1
a further 10 @entity18 nations -- including the @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 -- continue to use their own currencies			2
recession a recession is technically defined as two consecutive quarters of shrinking output -- or a country going backwards financially			2
the eurozone is currently teetering on the edge of recession , triggered in part by the crisis which has rolled on since may 2010			1
a double dip recession is when a country which has been in recession enters a downturn again after a brief and weak recovery			2
contagion the " contagion effect " referred to in the eurozone crisis is the fear that one country 's financial problems will spill over to another country			1
this happens because the capital markets -- where sovereign bonds are bought and sold -- can be influenced by sentiment as well as the fundamentals of each country			1
contagion can also occur because the more countries within the bloc struggle , the higher the cost to others of giving aid			2
default countries , or companies , default when they can no longer pay their bills on time			0
defaults can come in different forms : " orderly " -- when investors holding the bonds can agree to take haircuts ( see below ) -- or " disorderly , " where losses are unexpected and sudden			0
bond yield countries raise money by issuing sovereign bonds which are then purchased by investors			1
the ' " yield " of the bonds - which can be thought of as @entity87 -- is how much the investor wants to be paid to hold that bond			1
so , a higher yield indicates a higher risk bond			1
for sovereign bonds a yield of more than 7 % is considered unsustainable for any extended period of time , because a country 's earnings are unlikely to be able to cover repayments			1
liquidity liquidity is the oil which greases the world of finance			0
it refers to the ease at which funds -- cash , for example -- can flow through the system			0
a market with lots of buyers and sellers is liquid , while one without is illiquid			0
haircut a haircut refers to a cut in the value of investments lenders are asked to take			0
for example , a 50 % haircut on an investment means you 'll get back only half of what you paid			0
investors in @entity125 bonds have been asked to take a haircut on their debt			0
it would be in their interest to do so if they thought the value of the debt could drop further in the future			0
investors can also be asked to swap bonds maturing soon for longer dated ones which would pay out at a much later date			0
junk the ratings agencies -- @entity138 's and @entity139 being the big three -- award scores based on a company or country 's credit worthiness			1
" junk " refers to when that rating drops below investment grade			0
once a credit rating drops below the @entity151 level , it is " sub-investment " grade and is commonly referred to as junk			0
eurobond eurobonds are being suggested as a way to tie the finances of the eurozone 's 17 countries more closely			1
a eurobond would be a bond -- or debt which investors buy in return for yield -- backed by all the countries of the bloc			1
the idea remains under discussion , although it has rejected by the eurozone 's two most powerful leaders , @entity21 chancellor @entity173 and @entity22 president @entity174			1
fiscal union fiscal unity is centered on integrated taxation and spending			0
the eurozone is a monetary but not fiscal union , meaning its 17 members maintain their own taxation policies and also raise money to fund themselves			1
however , the bloc does have a central bank -- the @entity185 ( see below ) -- which maintains monetary policy			0
the bloc appears to be moving toward closer fiscal integration as it seeks to stem the crisis			1
@entity185 the @entity185 , based in @entity189 , @entity21 , was set up in 1998 to maintain monetary policy for the eurozone under its common currency , the euro			1
the @entity185 's mandate is to keep inflation at around 2 % or below , and ensure some level of stability for the countries that use the euro			1
like other central banks , the @entity185 's main tool for keeping to these targets is by raising or lowering interest rates -- a key tool for influencing financial markets			1
the @entity185 has also been actively buying the sovereign bonds of troubled eurozone economies , in the hope that it will lower those countries ' funding costs			2
@entity210 the @entity210 ( @entity210 ) is @entity212 's temporary bailout fund			2
it was hurriedly set up after @entity125 needed its first bailout in may 2010 , and has since become a key tool to combat the debt crisis			2
@entity212 leaders have increased its lending capacity from around â ‚ ¬ 250 billion to â ‚ ¬ 440 billion , and are investigating ways to boost its clout			0
a permanent bailout fund , the @entity221 , or @entity221 , should be available as early as next year			0
@entity223 the @entity223 , which is based in @entity224 , is an organization of 187 countries			0
it is designed to assist countries in financial trouble			2
member countries contribute to the fund , relative to their economies , when assistance is needed			0
it has been a key player in the @entity212 bailouts .			0
