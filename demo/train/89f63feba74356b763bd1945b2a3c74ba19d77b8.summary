thank you for your " likes " at @entity26 / @entity25			2
let 's get today 's show started ! first up : @entity28 ? @entity29 : @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35			1
if you 've been watching the news the past several weeks , you know what these countries have in common : political unrest			1
people speaking out against their governments , calling for changes			0
what 's happening in that part of the world could certainly have an impact on other countries around the globe			1
during a speech yesterday , president @entity51 talked about the role that the @entity54 might play			1
@entity54 president @entity51 : what happens in each of these countries will be determined by the citizens of those countries			1
we do want to make sure that transitions do not degenerate into chaos and violence			0
that 's not just good for us , that 's good for those countries			1
@entity29 : we 're seeing some of these same themes with these protests			0
they 're often organized with social media			0
the focus is on government leaders or policies that have been in place for a long time			0
but the situations are unique			0
and @entity76 is going to show us how the @entity54 has been involved so far			1
( begin video ) @entity76 , @entity0 @entity79 , @entity6 : is this what the @entity51 administration hopes could be the next people 's revolution ? @entity32 police clash with demonstrators on the streets of @entity88 , and secretary of state @entity89 connects the dots with @entity31 's revolution			1
@entity54 secretary of state hillary clinton : we wish the opposition and the brave people in the streets across cities in @entity32 , you know , the same opportunity that they saw their @entity31 counterparts seize in the last week			1
@entity101 : as @entity32 police round up activists , the @entity102 begins tweeting encouraging messages in the @entity106 language , telling @entity32 we want to join in your conversation			0
just days after a revolution toppled @entity31 's longtime ruler , @entity110 , unrest is rippling through the region , and the @entity54 is trying to figure out how to handle it			1
in @entity33 , protesters clash with security forces and the @entity102 proclaims their support for the universal rights of the @entity33 people , adding , these rights apply on the internet			0
the government of @entity121 puts a blogger on trial for espionage ; the @entity102 calls for her freedom			0
in @entity130 , the chairman of the @entity127 and a top @entity102 official meet with @entity129 to show support for the new government he swore in following anti-government protests			1
yet nothing is settled in @entity31			0
trying to muster international support , president @entity51 has been speed - dialing fellow leaders in @entity137 , @entity130 and @entity138 to help keep pressure on the @entity31 military to turn a revolution into a real democracy			1
secretary @entity89 called the @entity31 foreign minister and her counterparts in eight other countries			0
the tide of democracy opens opportunities , officials say , but a former @entity151 director says this is not a stack of dominoes			0
@entity154 , former cia director : the challenge is how does one manage that during the transition period so that you do n't see some of the more radical and , unfortunately , those are generally the best organized groups , seizing control , capturing the revolution and taking it into a direction that 's very dark			1
( @entity164 ) @entity165 @entity29 : the @entity165 is the highest civilian honor that 's given out by the @entity54 government			1
in a ceremony yesterday at the @entity169 , president @entity51 gave out 15 of them , describing this year 's recipients as " the best of who we are and who we aspire to be			1
" that includes former president @entity176 , @entity54 's 41st president , whose career of public service spanned 70 years			1
@entity181 congressman and civil rights leader @entity179 , as well as @entity183 chancellor @entity182 were also given @entity184			0
but it was n't just politicians			0
artists , like the famous poet @entity188 , whom the president 's sister is named after , along with cellist @entity191 and artist @entity192 were honored at the ceremony			1
sports legends @entity194 and @entity196 were also among the @entity165 honorees			0
@entity198 @entity199 , @entity14 : time for the shoutout ! what part of the human brain is associated with memory ? if you think you know it , then shout it out ! is it the : a ) @entity210 , @entity211 or @entity212 ) @entity209 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! your memory is controlled by part of your cerebrum			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! man vs. machine @entity29 : how does our cerebrum stack up against a computer 's memory banks ? that is the challenge playing out on " @entity226 ! " this week			1
it 's a three - day event pitting two of the show 's biggest all - time winners against a super-computer named @entity232			1
this thing was created by @entity234			0
the company says @entity232 has the processing power of 2,800 powerful computers			0
@entity232 's developers say it 's a major step forward in the ability of machines to understand human language			1
that 's part of what makes this game so interesting , since a lot of @entity226 ! clues involve word play or double meanings			1
host @entity251 described @entity232 's first day of performance as " very bright , very fast , but some weird little moments once in a while			1
" @entity256 @entity29 : so , we 're not in @entity258 just yet			0
but we want to hear your take on this man vs. machine face - off			1
are you interested to see if a computer can learn language ? do you think machines could ever be as smart as people ? @entity268 to our blog at @entity267 , let us know what you think			0
this day in history @entity29 : it 's february 16th , and on this day in history in 1923 , @entity272 archaeologist @entity271 unsealed the tomb of ancient @entity31 ruler @entity274			2
in 1959 , @entity275 was sworn in as the prime minister of @entity277 after leading a communist revolution that overthrew @entity277 's previous leader			2
in 1968 , the first ever 9 - 1 - 1 call was made in @entity281 , @entity282			2
the answer on the other end of the line ? " hello			0
" and in 2005 , the @entity286 , a treaty aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions , went into effect			0
inspiring youth @entity29 : well , in more recent history -- like last week -- i interviewed former @entity292 running back @entity293			1
he 's known for his accomplishments on the field during 12 seasons with the @entity297 and the @entity298			2
but he 's also known for his humanitarian work with the @entity301 , that helps single parents achieve their dream of owning a home			2
in the second part of our conversation , i talked with mr. @entity293 about what advice he has for young people			1
take a listen to this			0
( begin video ) @entity29 : how does somebody who does that , who plays for the @entity298 , the @entity297 , how do you stay humble and positive through all that ? @entity293 , @entity292 running back , @entity319 : i 've learned early in my life that treat people the same way you want to be treated			1
but also , i thought about my mom , her dream , her mission , how she treated people , how she wanted better for other people			0
i 've tried to live through her , live through her lessons in life , and i wanted to be like her			0
@entity29 : what would you tell some of the high school students who are watching our show , who they love what they do , they love playing , but they might not have the talent or the gift to play professionally ? @entity342 : it 's a lot that goes into it			1
i think , first and foremost , you have to understand " why are you in school ? " your focus has to be education , and i learned that early			2
set yourself up , put yourself in a position to really go to the next level , and that 's get a college scholarship , graduate from college , get the degree			2
the game , you ca n't play the game forever			2
@entity29 : what advice do you have for today 's students who do n't know what they want to do ? @entity342 : you can experience so many different things to really understand what you love or to find something that you 're passionate about			1
that 's really going out of your comfort zone and really trying new and different things			2
it 's all about checks and balances			2
it 's all about thinking about not , " how am i going to live today , " but " how am i going to live 20 , 30 years down the road			1
" you have to have a plan ; nothing is going to come easy			0
you have to work for the things that you want			0
( @entity164 ) before we go @entity29 : that man was a very good interview			0
and we 're gon na be putting both parts of it up in the @entity382 section at @entity267 , so keep an eye out for that			0
our last story , before we go today , my very first job was bagging groceries at a supermarket			2
but i do n't remember it being anywhere near this intense ! these folks are the best of the best			0
that 's why they 're competing in the @entity396			2
contestants have to fill three bags with everyday items , like bread , eggs and cans			0
the winner , @entity403 from @entity404 , @entity405 , did it in just 38 seconds			0
goodbye @entity29 : with her superior speed and technique , that title was in the bag			0
but it 's time for us to check out for now			2
we 'll be back tomorrow with more commercial - free headlines			2
hope you have a great day .			0
