-- a powerful storm is making its way through the northeastern @entity3 , expected to dump 2 feet of snow or more in some areas			1
this weekend will be another test of how accurate those forecasts are			1
weather forecasts are much more accurate today than decades ago , but they are still not perfect			1
there are two big hurdles to overcome			0
one is creating accurate mathematical descriptions of the dynamics of the atmosphere			1
two is increasing the resolution of the weather model			1
there are many features of the atmosphere that interact in complex ways			1
for example , the microphysics of clouds is very hard to describe mathematically , and varies for different types of clouds			0
there are internal gravity waves , which propagate continuously through the atmosphere with significant energy and have the capability of driving , or slowing , strong winds			1
the atmosphere includes general circulations that are affected by each other , and by the dynamics of the ocean and rotation of the earth			1
depending on the temperature , pressure and humidity of the air , clouds will form and eventually result in rain			0
any anomaly can change the entire system			0
( just think of the @entity47 , in which a small change such as a butterfly flapping its wings can affect something bigger , like a bird flying by , which can affect something even bigger , like an airplane , until a storm is formed			2
) once we find that anomaly , we can track it because we know how the surrounding circulations can affect it			0
by the numbers : northeast blizzard we predict the weather by putting all the observations we have on winds , temperatures , pressures and other variables into a mathematical model that estimates how these systems will interact			1
unfortunately , the earth 's circumference at the equator is almost 25,000 miles , so when we try to model the entire earth , and go up into the mesosphere ( about 25 to 50 miles above the earth ) the picture gets fuzzier			1
meteorologists can tell you , about five days out , with fair certainty what the weather will be like in your city or town			1
but it 's nearly impossible to accurately model strong weather systems such as big storms or hurricanes , which include various cloud systems			1
in 2011 , some residents in @entity92 , @entity93 , evacuated from their homes before @entity95 approached , but @entity95 took another path and the evacuation turned out to be unnecessary			0
the mathematical model was n't wrong , but it could n't know with absolute certainty the pathway of @entity95			2
in 2010 , a big winter storm was predicted for @entity102			2
many schools in the state canceled classes			0
the storm turned out not to be not so bad			2
this may be partly due to the effect of small , unresolved variations in the atmosphere , such as internal waves , that weakened the storm			1
staying safe when the lights go out although miscalculations occur , they are not particularly common , especially over the past decade			0
we have a much better understanding of the dynamics of the atmosphere , more observations from towers , balloons and radar , and faster computers with much more processing speed and memory			1
weather forecasting models are continually improving			0
meteorologists are expected to know everything that is happening around the earth and tens of miles into the atmosphere			2
that 's more space than we can even fathom			0
and all of the systems within that space affect each other			0
think of it this way : a meteorologist 's job is equivalent to guessing when a flashmob is going to break out			2
at the outset , it seems impossible			0
but if you meet every person in your city , get to know each of their general habits , and keep track of everyone 's plans , you could guess when they might break out into song and dance as a group			0
we now know more about all of the systems in the atmosphere , how they affect each other and how they interact			2
there can still be anomalies , like that out - of - towner , but overall we have a pretty good idea what is going to happen and when			0
and if an anomaly occurs , how it will affect the entire system			0
we tease meteorologists about being wrong when they ca n't predict the weather to the exact detail , but their job is much harder than most people understand			1
just try to remember that the next time you have to shovel yourself out of that unexpected extra 6 inches of snow			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			2

a powerful storm is making its way through the @entity181
@entity177 : weather forecasts are much more accurate than decades ago
it 's nearly impossible to accurately model strong weather systems , she says
@entity189 : the dynamics of the atmosphere is complex ; meteorologists have a tough job
