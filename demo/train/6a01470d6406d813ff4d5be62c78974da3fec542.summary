-- for an institution that moves glacially , instant analysis is as impossible as it is unwise			2
yet first impressions are important			2
our initial glimpse of the new pope was curiously disconcerting			1
he stood there impassive and unemotional			2
he looked stunned , without almost any reaction at all except , perhaps , awe or even fear of the moment			2
suddenly , his eyes seemed to open wide , as if he was really seeing the position for which he had been chosen less than an hour before			2
and then he spoke , not with the power of physical force or energy but with something stronger : humility			0
with the election of cardinal @entity22 of @entity23 as pope , the @entity20 enters the next chapter of her history			1
and yet , as often happens in the church , she turns to her past for inspiration and even innovation			0
so we have the first pope to be elected from the @entity35 , known as the @entity35 , who were founded by @entity37 in the 16th century while @entity38 reeled from @entity40 challenges			1
yet this @entity41 takes the name @entity22 from the humble servant of medieval @entity44 who began the @entity47 order 300 years before @entity48			1
@entity22 took to the balcony with the word " bishop " crossing his lips more than " pope " or " pontiff			1
" he referred to himself first as the bishop of @entity56 and to @entity57 not as retired pope but emeritus bishop			1
there was something genuine about the way he referred to the journey of faith as one that he and the faithful take together in love and trust			0
he asked for help and the favor of a prayer -- but this was n't the standard " pray for me			0
" pope @entity22 bowed to receive that prayer from the people of @entity75 he now serves			1
opinion : @entity22 , open up the church looking back at the monthlong examination of conscience that @entity20 , @entity82 - watchers and the cardinals have undergone , what does @entity22 face ? what will he do based on his own experience ? the cardinals ' pre-conclave meetings seemed to reveal a particular job description , but the rumors and leaks seemed to have been wrong			1
this man is 76 and not in his 60s			0
he has not worked full - time in the @entity82 's headquarters , called the curia , raising immediate questions about how he will reform the institution 's central administration			1
it is hard , at least initially and under deadline , to discover how he acted when faced with clerical sexual abuse , although we have heard less of this awful situation in @entity103 than in the @entity104 and @entity105			0
@entity22 does seem to be a moderate who is respected by and can work with people sitting on different benches along the ideological spectrum			1
he is friendly with the conservative organization @entity110 and yet like @entity111 embraces the church 's lively sense of fairness and justice when it comes to the poor and middle class left out by rampant capitalism and its twin temptation , the gospel of prosperity			0
as archbishop , he took a bus to work and lived in a small apartment			0
opinion : the biggest moment in the world like @entity48 , he has a reputation for using his mind to solve a problem but his heart to make a decision			0
like @entity135 , he operates within the world of an ordained clergy while not being drowned in self - serving clerical rank and privilege			0
so what @entity22 seems to bring , at least at a first glance , is personal authenticity and credibility			1
both are critical precursors to change			0
many people want change , it is true , but any proposals that might or might not come wo n't mean a thing unless a new spirit of credibility and trust flows down the @entity154 throughout the planet 's oceans to the world 's 1.2 billion @entity20			1
for too long , it seems that the curia has been about power , which is not the same thing as authentic authority			2
people respond with lasting love to authority but with only temporary fear to power			2
for too long , the people in the pews have felt distanced from their priests , bishops and the @entity82			1
that is not the gospel of love and service that @entity174 preached			0
yet it is precisely the gospel that @entity135 and @entity37 learned from @entity174 and shared with the world in word and deed			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			0

cardinal @entity22 of @entity23 is selected as pope
@entity187 : at first glance , @entity22 seems to bring authenticity and credibility
he says that for too long , people have felt distanced from priests and @entity82
@entity195 : @entity22 has many challenges ahead ; we will have to see how he deals with them
