-- as @entity3 bishops in @entity4 began a major meeting on modern family life two weeks ago , @entity1 encouraged them to speak candidly and " without timidness			1
" he certainly got what he asked for			2
liberals lamented their colleagues ' rigidity			2
through it all , the @entity1 stayed silent			1
even when a report emerged from the bishops ' meeting that welcomed gays and lesbians in strikingly open terms , @entity1 did n't say a word			1
even when that welcome was watered down , not once , but twice , and then , on saturday , largely scrapped , the @entity1 revealed nothing			1
by the midpoint of the meeting -- officially called the @entity29 -- conservatives were complaining that @entity1 had " done a lot of harm " by not making his own views known			1
but if @entity1 had spoken , it would have shut down the very debate he wanted to spark , cardinal @entity35 , a close ally of the @entity1 's , told reporters			1
" @entity37 , causa finita , " @entity35 said			0
that 's @entity39 for , " @entity4 has spoken , the case is closed			0
" ( the @entity1 is the bishop of @entity4			1
) finally , as the meeting closed on saturday afternoon , the @entity1 addressed the nearly 200 bishops he had summoned to @entity4			1
in a widely praised speech , he told them the church must find a middle path between showing mercy toward people on the margins and holding tight to church teachings			0
what 's more , he said , church leaders still have a year to find " concrete solutions " to the problems plaguing modern families -- from war and poverty to hostility toward nontraditional unions			0
a follow - up meeting is scheduled for next october in @entity4			2
all of this may raise a few questions in people 's minds			0
if the @entity1 is the head of the church , why ca n't he just make changes on his own ? why are so many @entity68 resistant to revising church teaching ? and what does all of this have to do with @entity72 ? here are some things to keep in mind			1
@entity75 ? @entity72 did n't often talk about practical matters , scholars say , but he did talk about divorce			0
" i tell you that anyone who divorces his wife , except for sexual immorality , and marries another woman commits adultery , " @entity72 says in the @entity80			0
that statement may sound reactionary today , said @entity87 , a scholar of @entity88 and early @entity89 , but it was actually pretty progressive at the time			0
" in a world in which women had to be married to be successful , " she said , " being this stringent about divorce actually helped those women			0
" it especially helped women callously discarded by their husbands , which was allowed under @entity101 law , @entity87 added			0
so , when catholic bishops debate whether to allow divorced and remarried @entity68 to receive @entity104 -- as they did in @entity4 over the past two weeks -- many bring up this teaching from @entity72			1
if @entity72 said it , the logic goes , the church ca n't change it			2
tradition the @entity68 traces its roots to @entity112 , whom @entity72 gave the keys to heaven and who is considered by many to be the first bishop of @entity4 -- a sort of proto - pope , if you will			2
between then and now , a span of more than 2,000 years , the church has accrued layers upon layers of teachings and traditions			0
@entity68 call this the " deposit of the faith , " and many conservatives say the job of modern church leaders is to guard it , not change it			2
in fact , as truth -- with a capital t -- some conservatives argue that even the @entity1 can never change it			1
" the @entity1 , more than anyone else as the pastor of the universal church , is bound to serve the truth , " cardinal @entity139 , a leading conservative , told @entity140 recently			1
" the @entity1 is not free to change the church 's teachings with regard to the immorality of homosexual acts or the insolubility of marriage or any other doctrine of the faith			1
" cardinal @entity153 of @entity154 , another prominent church leader , suggested that doctrine could change , but only if the @entity1 called an ecumenical council			1
more liberal church leaders argue that core @entity3 teachings can evolve over time , as they did , for example , on slavery			1
" doctrine develops , " @entity162 cardinal @entity161 said last week			2
" saying that doctrine will never change is a restrictive view of things			1
" in the war of words between conservative and liberal @entity68 , the biggest battle is here : what can and can not change about the church 's moral tenets			2
the church universal the @entity68 has an estimated 1.2 billion members spread across hundreds of countries from @entity177 to @entity178			0
in many of those countries , ethics , particularly sexual ethics , differ widely			0
for instance , in @entity183 , 75 % of @entity68 believe that divorced and remarried @entity68 are " living in sin " and should not receive @entity104			0
in the @entity186 and @entity187 , just 30 % agree			0
on same - sex marriage , the gulf is just as wide			0
@entity183 ( 99 % ) and the @entity190 ( 84 % ) reject same - sex marriage , while a slim majority of @entity68 in the @entity186 support it			0
the @entity1 , as head of the whole @entity68 , has to consider all of his far - flung flock -- not just cater to a particular segment , said the rev. @entity196 , a @entity197 priest and author of the book " @entity72 : a pilgrimage			1
" " while he is interested in being prophetic and moving things forward , you ca n't move so fast that you lose an entire wing or geographic section of the church			0
" the old guard for nearly 35 years , the @entity68 was led by two popes -- @entity208 and @entity209 -- who held fast to traditional church teachings , and part of their mission was to appoint hundreds of bishops who share that view			2
as a result , conservative bishops hold top positions in many dioceses across the world and in the @entity221 itself			2
" these are people who have spent a lot of time accruing power and supporters , and they feel very strongly " about the church not changing , @entity87 said			0
since his election in 2013 , though , @entity1 has slowly but surely reversed that trend			1
the @entity1 has appointed moderates in several big dioceses , including in @entity231 earlier this fall , and he 's removed some archconservatives from their posts			1
@entity139 , for example , who is something of a hero to traditionalists , confirmed last week that he 's been ousted from the @entity240 's supreme court			0
so , while many liberals expressed disappointment that the bishops ' surprising welcome to gays was later retracted , others argue that at least the topic is still on the table for the next year 's meeting , when the church will make final decisions on these issues			1
put another way , taking " three steps forward , two back , is still going forward , " said @entity161 .			0
