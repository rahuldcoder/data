you 've heard of @entity1 , but unless you pay close attention to photo and video credits on news sites , you 've probably never heard of the @entity7 group @entity6			1
the @entity8 is one of several groups that aggregates photos and videos taken by citizen journalists in @entity7 and tries to show them to the world			1
most recently , the group came into the news on friday after it played a role in distributing images from a @entity19 - condemned massacre in the village of @entity21 , which left 108 people dead , including some children who reportedly were axed to death			1
@entity25 , meanwhile , put a collection of 10 videos from @entity21 on its homepage on saturday in an effort to raise awareness about the bloodshed there			1
of all the content , one particular photo -- of a tile room lined with bodies wrapped in white cloth -- became the de facto symbol of the violence in @entity21			1
it has been run by numerous news websites , including this one , with credit attributed to @entity8			2
photos : images paint horrific scene in @entity21 the photo and the group highlight a crucial trend as the government of @entity51 continues to crack down on protestors and rebels : activists and everyday people have taken it upon themselves to record violence against themselves and their neighbors and to distribute it online			1
and they do so at great risk to themselves			0
" perhaps the single most important way that people are telling their stories is through clips uploaded through @entity25 , " @entity61 , a member of @entity7 's opposition group , said during a recent talk at the @entity64 , according to a live blog of the event that was posted online			1
" and activist have learned that for this information to be credible , it must be properly dated and documented			0
and they are hoping that one day , these videos may be used to bring the regime to justice			0
" if a picture is worth a thousand words , a video is worth a thousand times more			0
" should the @entity82 ' airdrop ' millions of phones into @entity7 ? networks like @entity6 have become aggregators and , in a sense , gatekeepers to the videos uploaded by citizen journalists			1
@entity7 often will upload controversial videos to @entity25 anonymously and without any information about the content , said @entity93 , editorial director at @entity94 , a company that verifies and distributes videos from citizen journalists to news organizations			1
the videographers then text information to aggregators like @entity6 , which adds details and distributes the videos more widely			1
the division of labor is intended to make the process of uploading information safer for all those involved , he said			0
and in a place where it 's difficult or sometimes impossible for journalists to report on the news , these images have become all the more important , said @entity93 , who is a former @entity1 employee			1
" it 's hugely significant , " he said			0
" as far as i can tell there were no international journalists anywhere near @entity21 when this happened and so the only original video from when the immediate aftermath -- not just of the bodies but of the shelling and everything else -- was provided by what you could call citizen journalists			1
" he added : " by the time the @entity19 got there the next day and shot video themselves , any number of things could have been changed or moved and manipulated			0
" @entity1 can not verify the authenticity of all photos and video submitted by citizen journalists in @entity7 , in part because the government restricts the movement of journalists in the country			1
@entity93 said aggregators like @entity139 are somewhat helpful at attempting to verify the authenticity of this kind of media , but they do n't always get it right			0
as the @entity147 's @entity146 wrote on monday , at least one fake image from the massacre in @entity7 made it onto a major news website			1
the mistake , made by the @entity156 , " seems like an innocent one , and is in some ways an inevitable result of the changing ways in which international media cover conflict zones , " he wrote			0
@entity139 was founded in 2011 , after the conflict began , by a man named @entity159 , according to an e-mail from a man who identified himself as @entity162 , and who is acting as a spokesman for the organization			0
even he does not know how many people contribute to @entity8			1
" there 's no specific number of activities as some of them have been arrested , killed , or wounded the remaining volunteers are not dedicated to reporting to the network , " he said			0
the group 's goal is to counteract misinformation from the @entity7 regime			1
he added : " we do n't have any kind of protection from any organization , we are always in danger			0
" according to its website and @entity185 page , @entity139 is headquartered in @entity186 , the @entity7 capital			2
@entity187 , a @entity7 activist based in @entity188 , said @entity6 has been a " prime source " for videos and grassroots information coming out of @entity7			1
the group has become so closely watched that fake @entity6 accounts have popped up on @entity185 and @entity25 , @entity187 said , with similar logs but wildly different information			1
" they are really valuable , " he said			0
" it 's just very tricky to verify it sometimes because the regime often fakes activist videos just to discredit them			2
" he added : " videos spread like wildfire once they 're out so it 's very important that they be verified before they 're uploaded			1
" @entity187 pointed to a @entity185 page for " @entity207 , " with too many a 's in its name , and three @entity25 channels -- shaamnews2 , shaamnews6 and shaamnews10 -- as fakes that are likely operated by people loyal to the @entity51 regime in @entity7			1
@entity25 , the @entity216 - owned video site , is working with @entity94 to try to verify activist videos from @entity7 and distribute them via its website			1
the company has created a @entity221 channel and a @entity223 channel to highlight the verified videos			0
@entity25 appears to be making efforts to keep content that has high news value on its platform , even if the content could be deemed objectionable or graphic			0
the video channel occasionally marks clips as graphic or requires users to sign in to prove that they are older than 18 before watching videos that are violent or gruesome			0
@entity235 , director of international freedom of expression at the @entity238 , said in an e-mail that @entity25 and @entity185 generally are doing a good job of making sure videos from @entity7 activists surface on their platforms			2
" @entity25 has been great about keeping content up , even recently creating a human rights channel with the organization witness , " she said			0
" their policy is , explicitly , to keep up violent content if it is educational or documentarian in nature			0
" a @entity25 spokeswoman declined to comment on the record for this story			0
getting the videos from @entity7 to the @entity258 is , of course , a major challenge			2
@entity93 , from @entity94 , said many @entity7 activists upload videos via proxy servers , which are located in other countries , so that it 's more difficult for the government to track them			1
they also may scramble their communications or run small hard drives or camera cards across the border to neighboring countries so that they can be uploaded , he said			0
the @entity7 government , meanwhile , has been tracking their efforts with some success			2
according to a report from @entity1 's @entity278 : " supporters of dictator @entity51 first steal the identities of opposition activists , then impersonate them in online chats , said software engineer @entity276			2
they gain the trust of other users , pass out trojan horse viruses and encourage people to open them			0
" @entity93 said dozens of @entity25 videos still are uploaded from @entity7 every day			2
watching these clips , from @entity6 and many others , is perhaps the best and fastest way , he said , to get a sense of what 's really going on inside the country right now			2
four journalists have been killed in @entity7 since the conflict began , according to the activist group @entity297			2
@entity19 officials say more than 9,000 people have died in the conflict , which began in march 2011			2
opposition groups put the number at more than 11,000 .			0

@entity8 or @entity6 helps distribute amateur videos from @entity7
the information is *increasingly* important as it 's difficult for journalists to report there
a photo credited to @entity6 came to represent friday 's massacre in @entity21
108 people died in the massacre , according to reports
