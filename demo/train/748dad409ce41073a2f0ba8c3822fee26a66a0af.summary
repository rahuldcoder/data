but his movies are most popular among @entity9 audiences and @entity1 is often dressed in drag as his " @entity34 " character			1
the misunderstanding and tension described by @entity1 suggests that the two white officers did not recognize @entity1 as one of @entity28 's richest and best - known citizens			1
it happened " a few days " before @entity1 hosted president @entity41 at his studio on march 17 , he said			1
@entity41 was in @entity28 that day to campaign and attend fundraisers			1
" most times when i leave the studio i have an unmarked escort , " @entity1 wrote			1

it 's a safety precaution that my security team taught me			0
" police pulled him over after he made a left turn from the right lane , he said			0

" why do you think someone would be following you ? " the officer , standing at his driver 's door , asked			0
he then heard " a hard banging " on his passenger - side window , @entity1 wrote			1
" i had never been in this position before so i asked the officer who was at my window what was going on and why is someone banging on the window like that , " @entity1 wrote			1
" let your window down , let your window down			0
your windows are tinted , " he said the officer told him			0

" what is wrong with you ? " that officer said			0
" he thinks he 's being followed , " the first officer said			0

" what is wrong with you ? " the officer on the driver 's side then reached into the car " pulling on the switch that turns the car on and off , " @entity1 said			1
" put your foot on the brake , put your foot on the brake ! " @entity1 said the officer commanded			2
" i was so confused as to what he was doing , or what he thought he was doing , " @entity1 wrote			2
" it looked like he was trying to pull the switch out of the dashboard			0
" @entity1 wrote that he then realized the officer was trying to grab the key , which was not there			2
" i reached down into the cup holder to get the key , not realizing that the key had a black leather strap on it , " @entity1 wrote			2
" as i grabbed it they both tensed up and i dropped it as i heard my mother 's voice from when i was a little boy			0
" " if you get stopped by the police , especially if they are white policemen , you say ' yes sir ' and ' no sir ' , and if they want to take you in , you go with them , " @entity1 said his mother often told him			1
" do n't resist , you hear me ? do n't make any quick moves , do n't run , you just go			0
" " it was n't until after i heard her voice that i realized that both of these officers were white , " he wrote			2
the first officer asked him again " why do you think someone is following you ? " " i think you guys need to just write the ticket and do whatever you need to do , " @entity1 said he told them			2
" we may not let you go , " the officer said			0
" you think you 're being followed , what 's wrong with you ? " another police cruiser pulled up after @entity1 stepped out of his car , he said			1
" this officer was a black guy , " @entity1 wrote			2
" he took one look at me and had that ' @entity145 ' look on his face			0
" he was finally recognized			0
the black officer spoke " in a hushed tone " to the two white officers , he said			2
" after that , one of the officers stayed near his car while one came back , very apologetic , " @entity1 wrote			1
@entity1 did not identify the officers or specify which police department in the @entity28 metropolitan area they were from			1
@entity1 posed a question to his readers : " do you see how quickly this could have turned for the worse ? " " now i know that there are many great officers , patrolmen and security guys out there , " wrote @entity1 , who employs a small army of his own security officers to guard his movie studio			1
he then made an apparent reference to the killing of @entity172 teenager @entity171 , who was shot by a man who told police he feared for his life			0
" i 'm not sure how a murder in @entity172 can be protected by a ' stand your ground law , " he wrote			0
@entity1 also raised the cases of two missing men -- one black and one @entity182 -- last seen in the back of a deputy 's patrol car in @entity186 , @entity172 , in 2004			2
@entity1 wrote that he has been " screaming at the top of my lungs " about the disappearances of @entity191 and @entity192			2
