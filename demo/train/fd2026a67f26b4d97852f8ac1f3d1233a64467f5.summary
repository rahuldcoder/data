-- " @entity3 claims require extraordinary evidence , " the astronomer @entity0 once said			0
in the case of the extraordinary claim concerning the possible discovery of the wreck of @entity10 , the flagship of @entity13 ' fleet , it 's clear that we are n't there yet			1
in fact , we seem to be getting further away from proof all the time			0
the potential discovery of the wreck , which happened on the first of @entity13 ' four voyages to the @entity22 , has become a flashpoint for the difficulties of determining the authenticity of artifacts honored in memory but difficult to locate in the present			1
the discoverer , underwater explorer @entity29 , says he has quite a few reasons to believe he 's found the right ship in the @entity33			2
@entity13 left details in his diary about the location of the sinking , which happened near @entity38 on christmas day in 1492			1
@entity29 maintains that description matches the shipwreck 's whereabouts			0
500 - year - old mystery solved ? as the author of " @entity13 : the @entity49 , " which surveys the explorer 's career , i was naturally drawn to this remarkable find -- if that 's what it is			1
love him or hate him , @entity13 made a difference			2
no one doubts that he led some of the most important voyages of discovery ever undertaken , and that 's why the fate of @entity10 matters today			1
the story of this wreck is well - known , and documented by @entity13 himself			1
on christmas eve 1492 , crew members of all three ships were celebrating , drinking and looking forward to a speedy voyage home to @entity66			0
( the outward - bound trip had taken just 33 days , a testament , in part , to @entity13 ' navigational genius			2
) @entity13 said he stretched out for a nap at this time			2
as the fleet traversed the northern coast of what is now @entity38 , the ship 's master turned over the tiller to a 14 - year - old ship 's boy , and soon after @entity10 ran into a reef and began to disintegrate			1
@entity13 managed to rescue everyone -- in fact , he never lost anyone at sea in his eight transatlantic crossings -- and to gather valuable items from the ship before it sank into an estimated 15 to 25 feet of water			1
that 's a summary of what we know , and the wreck should take these factors into consideration to be considered authentic			0
for starters , @entity13 described in his log how the mainmast of the ship was cut away , and , as he wrote , " she lay on her beam ends			1
" any discovery should be consistent with these descriptions , but so far no information about that is forthcoming			0
and then we also have to account for erosion -- tides and hurricanes -- changing the shoreline and the reef over half a millennium			2
it 's entirely possible , indeed , likely that reefs encountered by @entity10 have shifted significantly over time , altering or moving the wreck			1
next , there 's the evidence in @entity13 ' own hand : his map of the coastline where the ship supposedly sank			1
again , it represents how things looked to him 500 years ago rather than in the present			1
and , most frustrating of all , perhaps , @entity13 occasionally fudged his navigational records			2
why ? to prevent others from exploiting his discoveries			0
finally , it 's unlikely that any of the wooden parts of the ship have survived after all these years			1
other ships have sailed through those same waters over the years , and perhaps collided with the reefs			0
how to tell one ancient wreck from another ? all of these factors make finding @entity10 difficult			1
how can a shipwreck hunter make his claims stick ? @entity29 has pointed to " ballast " in the form of stones from the ship as evidence to identify @entity10			2
but ships in those days probably did n't have stone ballast to steady them ; heavy cargo such as wine casks served the same function			0
and then there 's the intriguing " smoking gun , " as @entity29 calls it , the lombard , or cannon , aboard @entity10			0
just before his presentation at the @entity163 in @entity164 in 2006 , @entity29 discovered that these items were missing from the site , " looted , " he explained			0
that 's frustrating , especially because back in 2003 , he was aware of the wreck and its probable lombards , if that 's what they were , and he was touting a visit to the site as part of an auction held by the @entity163			0
but now the lombards , if that 's what they were , are gone			0
there 's not much left to go on			0
exploration is all about finding something unknown , which often means shaking things up , disproving rather than confirming to arrive at something new			0
since 2006 , it seems that little was done to secure or explore the site , and given its potential importance , i wonder why that is			0
given its potential historic significance , let 's hope this wreck will finally receive the careful and responsible attention it deserves .			1

@entity198 says he found wreck of @entity10 , flagship of @entity13 ' fleet , off @entity38
@entity203 believes discovery is *highly* unlikely , given erosion , shifts , tides
@entity203 : the wooden parts of the ship probably have not survived 500 years
@entity203 : given potential historic significance , this wreck needs careful examination
