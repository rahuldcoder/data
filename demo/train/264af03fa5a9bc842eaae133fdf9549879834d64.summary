@entity0 seems to have hit hard times			0
the unfortunate fellow has been forced to buy a second - hand 757 from @entity5 co-founder @entity4 for a paltry $ 100 million -- though he did then coat every metal surface in gold			2
but had he been feeling really extravagant , he could have thrown the kids ' inheritance at a @entity11 ( @entity11 ) with a new @entity13 engine -- the latest technological jump from the company that recently unveiled the 747 - 8 , their largest offering to - date and the longest commercial jet in the world			1
@entity19 -- the division dedicated to pimping out their commercial airliners and selling them to embarrassingly rich people -- has taken this beast under its wing			0
the 747 - 8 @entity26 is the latest , longest and about the most expensive corporate jet in the world -- a shiny new , " green " ( empty ) 747 - 8 will set you back $ 300 million , but with a @entity29 fit - out the figure is closer to $ 500 million			1
but what else is there out there for those with a few hundred million to splash ? also on @entity34 : what 's so special about the @entity36 ? the jet set the traditional @entity19 are the 700 - , 800 - and @entity38 at 34 meters , 40 meters and 42 meters long			2
you 'll pay up to $ 115 million for the largest of these			0
at the top end of the line is the superlative - filled super-jumbo			0
a touch over 76 meters long , the 747 - 8i @entity29 also boasts a cabin 6.1 meters wide , dwarfing the @entity11 's ( only the 737s are referred to as " @entity46 " -- all other models are " vip " ) 3.5 meters , and it has up to 525 square meters of floor - space -- two or three times the size of your average house			1
then there 's the latest engine			2
@entity11 recently announced that the " @entity13 " engine is now available as an option for all new 737 orders for commercial airliners , asserting that it can offer fuel - savings of up to 16 percent over competitors			1
" we intend to take advantage of the improved efficiency of the new @entity13 family for our @entity11 product line , " says @entity11 president @entity61			2
" we 've studied the capabilities of all the @entity13 variants and of course they offer significant range , economic and environmental benefits over the current line of @entity11 products			1
" also on @entity34 : @entity75 's biggest model airport who 's buying ? @entity11 is tight - lipped about who , exactly , is buying these " flying castles " -- apparently crazy - rich people cherish their anonymity -- but can reveal that almost half of the 206 bbjs and @entity84 ordered since their launch in 1996 have gone to private owners , and a third of them have headed for the @entity89			1
@entity0 's " new " 757 is basically a 20 - year - old 737 , but with a fuselage that 's five meters longer			0
with a poky floor - space of 125 square meters and a range of around 8,000 kilometers , it 's a far cry from the 747 - 8 @entity29 , whose range is over 17,000 kilometers			1
but for the multi-millionaire tech - heads who just have to possess the very latest technology , and you 're less concerned about spacious luxury than you are about speed , there 's a new corporate jet dubbed the @entity104 that 'll get you from a to b at @entity105 for the bargain price of $ 80 million			1
the release date 's not set , but pre-orders are now open			0
the company claims to have $ 4 billion worth of " letters of intent " for what will no doubt be the gem at every air show for years to come			0
also on @entity34 : 10 great cities , 100 fantastic free attractions			0

the 747 - 8 @entity26 is the latest , longest and about the most expensive corporate jet in the world
the new " @entity13 " engine can offer fuel - savings of up to 16 percent over competitors , @entity11 says
@entity11 is tight - lipped about who , exactly , is buying these " flying castles "
