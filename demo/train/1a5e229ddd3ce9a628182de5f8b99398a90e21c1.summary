-- president @entity2 's blockbuster announcement that he is in favor of full marriage equality is the most courageous thing he has done since he entered the @entity6 three and a half years ago			1
coming after his successful strategy to get @entity8 to repeal do n't ask , do n't tell so that gays and lesbians can serve openly in the military and the decision of his @entity13 to stop defending the @entity15 in federal courts , he has now done nearly as much for gay people as @entity18 did for african - americans with the passage of the @entity21 and the @entity22			1
@entity2 : ' same - sex couples should be able to get married ' people like me , who were among his most passionate supporters in 2008 , felt a sense of gigantic relief			1
the man who seemed like such a courageous candidate four years ago finally sounded like a genuinely courageous president			0
coming so soon after his decision not to sign an executive order that would have banned discrimination against gays and lesbians among federal contractors , wednesday 's statement instantly obliterated the doubts of millions of his gay supporters			1
in some ways , the momentum of his own presidency on gay rights made wednesday 's declaration inevitable			1
in his interview with @entity48 , the president himself cited the end of do n't ask , do n't tell as one reason he felt compelled to speak out			0
" i think about those soldiers or airmen or @entity56 or sailors who are out there fighting on my behalf and yet feel constrained , even now that do n't ask , do n't tell is gone , because they are not able to commit themselves in a marriage , at a certain point i 've just concluded that for me personally , it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that i think same sex couples should be able to get married , " the president said			2
many polls have shown healthy majorities among @entity70 younger than 30 in favor of marriage equality , and the president noted that even college republicans who oppose the rest of his policies " are very clear that when it comes to same - sex equality or , you know , sexual orientation that they believe in equality			1
" the other two facts that probably made his decision easiest were contained in a @entity83 released this week , which showed that 65 % of @entity84 and 57 % of independents agree that gay marriage should be legal			1
what made the decision most difficult is the closeness of the presidential race in battleground states such as @entity92 and @entity93 -- especially after @entity93 residents voted overwhelmingly tuesday to change the state constitution so that not only marriage but all forms of domestic partnership would be banned for same - sex couples			1
the effect on the president 's base was immediate and electric			2
@entity103 , the long - time treasurer of the @entity104 , said that most " @entity106 donors were already willing to focus on all the great stuff that has been done and how much more we 'll get done if he 's re-elected			2
but today has ramped up the enthusiasm dramatically			0
i 've gotten calls and five - figure credit card authorizations already from people who were just waiting for this			0
the enthusiasm level is very high			0
" former @entity118 mayor @entity117 is a strong supporter of the president			0
the dean of @entity118 @entity84 also has one of the oldest and strongest records in support of gay rights of any modern @entity70 politician , having first come out in favor of the repeal of @entity129 's anti-sodomy law in 1962			1
when informed of the president 's action by @entity0 , @entity117 said , " someone should write a play about this -- there 's so much drama here ! " " the question will be , was he pushed , or are these his real feelings ? " @entity117 continued			2
" i believe this is how he really feels			0
i commend him for doing this			0
" the former mayor pointed out that until today , the president was getting the " worst of both worlds " by continuing to say that his feelings were evolving on this subject			0
" he was evolving into dust			0
and now he has evolved into a major figure who should be thanked by the country			0
" among the president 's most fervent supporters , a latent fear remains that this announcement could cost him the election			2
but a new feeling offers gigantic compensation : the conviction that we really did elect a genuinely transformational president			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			2

@entity164 : @entity2 's stance on gay rights has effect similar to @entity21
his statement instantly obliterated doubts of millions of his gay supporters , he writes
@entity83 : 65 % of @entity84 , 57 % of independents support same - sex marriage
gay supporters , he says , now feel they helped elect a transformational president
