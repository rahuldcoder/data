-- do you remember that scene in " @entity3 " where the kids fly away on their bmxs ? after seeing it , did you too want to pedal your bike down the street , over your house and past the moon ? well , now that fantasy can be reality with the invention of the @entity15 flying bicycle			1
a pair of flight enthusiasts , @entity18 , 37 , and @entity19 , 42 , have devised a two - wheeled bike -- christened the @entity15 -- that transforms into an aircraft			1
the @entity24 inventors say it is the world 's first fully functional flying bicycle			1
the machine can travel at speeds of up to 15 miles per hour on the road and 25 miles per hour in the air , reaching altitudes of up to 4,000 feet			1
" the @entity32 were former bicycle mechanics so there 's a real connection between cycling and the birth of powered flight that is recaptured in the spirit of the @entity40 , " says so - creator @entity18			2
the flying bicycle looks like a conventional bike connected to a lightweight trailer , which houses a giant fan , fuel for the contraption 's engine and the flexible fold - away wing			1
both the airframe and bike are made from aircraft grade aluminum			0
the bicycle can be disconnected from its trailer for inner city use , then docks to form a ' para-trike ' for take - off			0
in order to fly , the bike and trailer are fastened together , the wing is unfurled and an electric starter fires the biofuel - powered 249cc motor			2
tired @entity66 competitors might want to consider this option before taking on a particularly daunting hill climb			0
the @entity40 needs a long stretch of open ground , clear of obstructions for takeoff			0
once airborne , it can stay in the air for up to three hours			0
once it 's in the air , the flying bicycle 's inventors say that it controls like a conventional fan - powered paraglider			1
the fan can also be detached entirely from its housing and strapped directly onto your back			0
worn like this , no license is required to fly it in many countries -- including the @entity89 and the @entity24 -- but the @entity90 strenuously recommends proper training			2
so unless you have done it before , jumping off the closest cliff in your new @entity15 is not recommended			0
the bicycle is small enough to be taken on public transport , and the entire vehicle can be stowed in a garage or carried up stairs and stored at home			1
@entity18 says that since childhood he and @entity19 had always wanted to construct a flying bicycle			2
" we live in @entity104 - upon - @entity105 , on the outskirts of @entity107 , two minutes ' walk from the birthplace of the @entity110 -- a @entity24 aircraft company that built aircraft including the @entity113 for the @entity114 in @entity115 , " he said			1
" we spent our childhoods riding bikes and dreaming of flight			0
" @entity18 and @entity19 hope that at $ 16,000 the @entity40 will appeal to inner - city flight hobbyists , and believe that it may also be be useful as a " cost - effective aerial reconnaissance vehicle for forest rangers and border patrols			0
" the flying bicycle 's inventors are now looking for support through @entity125 and have so far raised approximately a tenth of their $ 78,000 goal			1
a film of the @entity40 in action can be seen on @entity130 .			0

@entity24 inventors have built a two - wheeled bicycle that *quickly* transforms into an aircraft
the @entity40 flying bicycle can fly to an altitude 4,000 feet at 25mph
the bike can be be taken on public transport and stored in a garage or flat
