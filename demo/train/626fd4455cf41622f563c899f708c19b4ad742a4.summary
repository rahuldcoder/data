-- @entity2 's " live " performance at the 2014 @entity3 brought a mixed reaction sunday night			1
" uncomfortable , odd and eerily interesting , " is how public relations agent @entity5 summed it up in a tweet			0
" not quite sure what to feel			2
# @entity9 " uncomfortable because @entity2 died nearly five years ago while preparing for a comeback tour			2
his remains are resting in a crypt in a @entity14 mausoleum			0
but technology tricked viewers -- and the celebrity audience in the @entity18 in @entity19 -- into suspending disbelief for a few minutes to watch the pop icon onstage dancing and singing his " new " song " @entity24			0
" @entity25 , the rapper - actor who hosted the show , actually introduced it as " live from the @entity18 , @entity2			1
" " he 's baaaccck ! " @entity28 , the owner of an @entity30 team and tv channel , tweeted about @entity2 's " hologram			1
" @entity28 added an @entity34 video			0
the dance moves were not really @entity2 's but apparently those of a stand - in performer who recreated his steps for a computer that then laid on an image intended to replicate @entity2			1
but where was the swagger -- like @entity43 -- that characterized @entity2 's cool walk ? " i wish it would have actually looked like him , " one fan said			1
it was eerily interesting because the illusion was effective if you did n't watch too closely or were n't obsessively familiar with @entity2 's dancing , walking and appearance			1
could have had better face but overall it was great			0
will have it on repeat , " a diehard @entity2 fan tweeted			1
# kendallyouhadonejob imagine @entity61 confusing the @entity62 with the @entity63 when he introduced the @entity67 group 's first live @entity65 television performance 50 years ago			2
that 's the modern equivalent of what @entity69 did at the @entity3			1
the reality tv personality , model and @entity74 half - sister caught herself halfway through introducing the @entity76 boy band @entity75 as @entity77			1
" now , we welcome one ... guys , i 'm the worst reader ! " @entity80 said as she dived below the camera shot			0
she quickly tossed to a video of the group -- which included a short clip comparing their arrival in the @entity88 to the @entity62 ' 1964 invasion			0
the television audience only heard her say " of @entity75 " when she resumed the intro after the video			2
@entity93 had a blast with the 18 - year - old 's flub			1
two hashtags soon trended : # kendallyouhadonejob and # @entity98 but many -- including @entity80 herself -- agreed on one thing			0
@entity69 looked great on the red carpet			2
@entity103 's message @entity103 wants you to know she 's no longer the young 15 - year - old who recorded " @entity105 , " a song that spent much of last summer at the top of the charts and was honored sunday as the " top rock song			1
" " what i wanted to say was that i am 17 and a half now , " @entity103 said as she accepted @entity3 's top new artist award			2
when laughter erupted with that remark , she stopped to say " that was n't a joke			0
" @entity103 's said she 's had " the opportunity to grow and learn as a new artist " in the last year " in the spotlight			1
" she later performed " @entity121 , " another song from her younger years			0
the irony not lost on the @entity3 audience is that many people are surprised to learn that the mature talking - acting - looking @entity125 is actually a teenager			0
# @entity127 became a trending topic on @entity93 worldwide			0
@entity129 : ' i want to thank everybody on @entity132 ... except @entity133 '			0

@entity2 fan : " not quite sure what to feel " about " hologram " performance
fans *complain* it was n't as good as @entity2 , but what else is ?
@entity69 gets buzz for botching @entity75 intro
@entity103 says she 's not the 15 - year - old she was when she recorded " @entity105 "
