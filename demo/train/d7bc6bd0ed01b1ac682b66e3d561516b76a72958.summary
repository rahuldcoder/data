@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , soul and a blend of rock and roll combine to make @entity1 music sound quite familiar , while the sound of the sabar , a traditional @entity1 drum , keeps the music true to its @entity14 roots			1
i 'm listening to the mbalax style of music for my latest " @entity19 " assignment : to experience the special sounds of @entity1			1
without a doubt , the biggest name in @entity1 drumming is @entity24			1
he 's almost mythical ; every person i interviewed spoke of him as the " sabar master			2
" with more than forty children and an untold number of grandkids , he 's been performing since the 1930 's , gradually crafting the unique rhythm of this part of the world -- literally with his bare hands			0
meeting the legend was not what i expected			0
at 82 years old he has a small frame and is such a humble person			2
when we arrived at one of his homes , he was more concerned with our crew eating breakfast than showing off his many accomplishments			0
@entity24 has performed with the @entity44 , @entity45 , at the @entity46 and has been declared by @entity47 as a " living human treasure			1
" most of his children learned from him , playing in a traveling orchestra			0
even his female grandchildren formed a group , practicing on the rooftop			0
however , when @entity0 's chief drum major -- who is draped in an elaborate @entity59 print -- steps behind his wide array of drums , modesty leaves the room			2
the beats are complex , quickly changing from soft , rapid taps of the finger tips and palm to loud strikes by the galan , or stick			1
strings pull the shaved goatskin surface tight and , by twisting a series of cylindrical pegs , each drum can be tuned just like a guitar			0
@entity24 explains that what i 'm hearing is more than music -- it 's a beautiful language reminiscent of his childhood in the @entity81 district			1
a time when certain types of drums would be used to communicate certain ideas ; calm , joyful messages for wedding ceremonies , or exciting , encouraging sounds for young men heading off to battle			0

he often appears as a special guest on stage with artists like @entity99 -- currently one of the best selling female singers in the country			0
when i watched her performing , she was serenading crowds in the local language of @entity107 , belting out the mbalax sound as she was being lowered in a golden cage onto a smoke - filled stage			1
but even next to a curvaceous woman wearing a sparkling dress , @entity24 holds his own -- an octogenarian with as much stage presence as a pop star			2
from inside a lively recording studio elsewhere in town i find more local artists who cite @entity24 as their inspiration			2
@entity120 is a group made up of @entity121 and @entity122 , plus the support of drummers , electric guitar players and a keyboardist			0
the sound is eclectic ; i can hear @entity129 reggae influences in their beats and in @entity122 's fast rapping style			1
@entity132 tells me that in songs like " @entity135 , " they pull from the @entity137 vocal tradition , essentially sampling from every place they 've toured			0
local history is important to them as well			0
on @entity120 's second album they included a song about @entity1 's @entity145 as a modern way of discussing the trans - @entity148 slave trade			1
but mostly , the group is optimistic and forward - looking			0
@entity122 explains to me that while they pull from the @entity24 - created @entity1 sound they want to include more aspects of music in the @entity14 diaspora because " we all came from @entity157 , and then went to different horizons to settle			1
" their aim is to connect with people globally			0

getting to a place of a strong , almost spiritual connection is what mbalax is really about - even though it might sound quite foreign to many of us			2
it was a privilege to meet @entity24 ( and even get a personal lesson in drumming ) , wonderful to see traditional music get a contemporary twist , and eye - opening to see @entity14 artists reaching out to the rest of the world			1
@entity121 summed up my impressions best : " @entity187 is not a matter of color -- it 's about heart			0

@entity196 , combining jazz , soul , and rock with traditional beats , is the dance music of @entity1
the *godfather* of the scene is the 82 - year - old drummer @entity24
his *instrument* is the sabar , the traditional drum played with the hand and a stick
younger generations are fusing the sound with new influences to reach *international* audiences
