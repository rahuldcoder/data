-- @entity3 opener @entity1 just missed out on reaching a remarkable triple - hundred as the hosts continued to turn the screw in the third cricket test against @entity7 at @entity8 on friday			1
@entity1 scored a career - best 294 as @entity3 racked - up a massive first innings total of 710 - 7 declared on day three , an unbeatable lead of 486 runs with two days play still remaining			1
and @entity3 's position became even stronger when @entity15 opener @entity13 was caught at slip for his second succesive opening ball duck , as the visitors began their second innings in disastrous fashion			0
however , in fading light , @entity21 and @entity22 steered @entity7 to 35 - 1 at the close of play , still needing a mammoth 451 runs to make @entity3 bat again			1
@entity7 can not possibly win the match now , but they will need to bat for the remaining two days to salvage a draw , or hope that some bad weather finds its way to @entity33			0
starting the day on 456 - 3 , in reply to @entity7 's score of 224 , @entity3 continued to plunder runs at will			2
and , after passing his second - ever test double century , @entity1 looked on course to become only the sixth @entity3 batsman in history to reach 300 , and first since @entity40 -- also against @entity7 -- in 1990			2
however , he was caught in the deep , off the bowling of @entity43 , just six runs short of that famous milestone			0
@entity1 's marathon innings of 12 hours and 47 minutes fell just half an hour short of the @entity3 record , set by @entity48 , when making 364 against @entity49 at @entity50 in 1938			0
their score of 710 was was @entity3 's best for 73 years and their third highest of all - time behind the 903 - 7 declared against @entity49 at @entity50 in 1938 and 849 against the @entity54 at @entity55 , @entity56 , in 1930			1
it also leaves them perfectly placed to go an unbeatable 3 - 0 up in the four - @entity59 series and secure the win that would see them replace @entity7 at the top of the @entity64 table .			0

@entity1 scores 294 as @entity3 *dominate* third test against @entity7
@entity1 's highest - ever test score helps @entity3 reach 710 - 7 declared
it is @entity3 's third - highest ever test score and their best since 1938
in reply , @entity7 have reached 35 - 1 , needing 451 runs to make @entity3 bat again
