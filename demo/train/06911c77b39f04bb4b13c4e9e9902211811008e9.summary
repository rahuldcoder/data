@entity0 when @entity3 @entity2 gov. @entity2 recently finished a speech blasting the @entity6 education standards , a room full of activists from the @entity9 jumped from their seats in applause			1
less than a year ago , they might have rushed for the door			0
the scene of @entity16 against @entity6 -- the education standards embraced by more than 40 states -- stands in stark contrast to his enthusiastic approval of the program when it was first introduced			1
@entity2 proclaimed to business leaders in 2012 that @entity6 " will raise expectations for every child			1
" in a short time , @entity2 has gone from serving as a steward of the @entity6 standards to one of the nation 's chief critics			1
but what 's more remarkable is that conservatives -- known for seeking ideological purity in their politicians -- are n't blasting @entity2 as a flip - flopper as he considers a 2016 presidential run			1
instead , they see him as uniquely positioned to be a leading advocate for their cause with the governor 's office to back up			2
indeed , many on the right have accepted @entity2 's repentance and are propping him up as an unlikely model for the @entity49 movement			2
" of the governors , he 's been the most active in speaking out on the issue , " @entity50 , @entity9 's education policy director , told @entity1			0
" quite frankly , he is the governor who has done the most to remove his state from @entity6			1
" this week , @entity2 released an education proposal through his nonprofit advocacy network , " @entity55 , " that in part recants his support			2
the paper seeks to absolve @entity2 of his previous position by claiming he had been misled through " deception			2
" " it was a bait - and - switch , " @entity2 told reporters monday at a luncheon at the @entity64 , a conservative think tank			1
" it was n't what we 've been told			0
it was n't what we had been promised			0
" but how did @entity2 go from championing the program to becoming one of its leading opponents ? in 2012 , after @entity2 and other governors implemented the program , @entity6 became a lightning rod issue among grassroots conservative activists who bemoaned it as a " federal takeover of education			1
" in 2013 , @entity2 began expressing concerns about the program after his staff held meetings with @entity6 opponents in the state			1
while some of the most vocal opposition to @entity6 came from conservatives worried about increasing federal control of local education , many parents also voiced concerns about the substance of the curriculum , particularly noting that their children found it confusing			0
other savvy @entity98 , particularly those with @entity101 - sized ambitions , began to take note			0
at conservative gatherings over the next year , @entity6 grew into one of the most talked - about issues			0
suddenly , almost every conservative who had ever hinted at having presidential ambitions wanted to make it clear that they opposed the new standards			0
former @entity112 gov. @entity111 , who once supported @entity6 , came out against it			0
the rallying cry " repeal @entity6 ! " became -- and remains -- a consistent crowd - pleaser in speeches by @entity117 sen. @entity116 of @entity118			0
in the context of the burgeoning presidential race , the opposition has one added bonus : it lets @entity125 use @entity6 as a proxy to outline a case against former @entity129 gov. @entity128 , a consistent @entity6 supporter who has also shown interest in running for president			2
@entity6 fight a larger battle over the size of government @entity2 did n't become one of the movement 's biggest proponents overnight			1
activists cite his leadership and what they describe as tireless advocacy as handing the @entity49 movement new momentum			0
@entity144 , a mother with school - aged children who has helped lead the grassroots push in @entity3 , said she first met with @entity2 's staff in september 2013 , bringing detailed information about the ills of @entity6			1
over the next year , @entity144 and other activists lobbied legislators in @entity3 and the governor 's staff to gather support			2
finally , frustrated with the lack of results , @entity144 reached out to her legislator and demanded a meeting with the governor â € ” and she got it early that summer			0
that first meeting came around the time when @entity2 began to express his firmest opposition to @entity6			1
and when he flipped , @entity2 flipped hard			0
by may 2014 , @entity2 began comparing the way @entity6 was being implemented to " central planning " in @entity166			1
amid a separate education battle with the @entity168 over the use of school vouchers in @entity3 , @entity2 began to accuse @entity171 of standing " in the schoolhouse door to prevent minority kids , " comparing them to segregationists who fought against the civil rights movement in the 1960s and blocked black students from attending classes with white students			1
@entity144 , who sat next to the governor at the @entity9 event last week , said that she believes @entity2 's conversion was " genuine " and does n't blame @entity2 for his initial opposition			1
instead , activists claim that @entity98 governors were duped by a massive public relations campaign and pressure from the @entity189 urging them to sign onto @entity6 to secure funding for their cash - strapped states			0
" i do n't really blame the governors , " @entity144 said			0
" they heard an informercial ... and they were all picking up the phone and ordering the product before it really ended			0
... they did n't stop to ask the question : has this been tested ? " @entity128 is n't saying ' @entity6 '			2

just a few years ago , the governor of @entity3 was an enthusiastic supporter of @entity6
now , @entity2 is leading the charge against the program
why the switch ? " it was n't what we had been promised "
