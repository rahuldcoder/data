@entity0 -- defense secretary @entity2 will unveil the @entity4 's plan to prepare for repealing the controversial " do n't ask , do n't tell " law regarding gay soldiers at a committee hearing tuesday , a @entity4 spokesman said			1
" the @entity4 leadership is actively working on an implementation plan and the secretary will have more to say about this next week , " @entity4 press secretary @entity9 said on thursday			1
president @entity13 said in his first @entity15 address wednesday night that he would work with @entity16 and the @entity4 this year to repeal the law that prohibits military members from acknowledging openly that they are gay			1
according to the @entity19 web site , the @entity19 has scheduled an hour to discuss the issue at tuesday 's hearing on the fiscal year 2011 defense budget , which @entity2 will attend			1
the committee revised its schedule for the hearing , announcing that @entity2 and @entity28 chairman adm. @entity27 will testify on the budget , as planned , as well as the " do n't ask , do n't tell " issue			1
@entity2 and @entity27 are not expected to offer a specific legislative proposal to repeal the law , but rather to detail some of the preliminary steps that need to be taken inside the military in advance of formulating a legislative plan			1
@entity37 will discuss options for more " humanely " implementing the current ban , for example , according to a senior @entity4 official			1
the secretary asked his general counsel 's office for options six months ago including how to possibly not expel personnel whose homosexuality is revealed by third parties , the source said			2
the 1993 law bars gay men and lesbians in the military from revealing their sexual orientation , and prevents the military from asking about it			2
another military official familiar with the discussion said some of the issues to be considered include the cost of implementing a new policy , benefits for gay spouses , potential hate crimes , and even logistical questions such as the possible need to renovate barracks to separate straight and gay troops			1
according to the official , the idea of separate housing or showers was not considered a serious possibility , but would be discussed in order to rule it out			0
previously , @entity2 has said the transition from the existing law should be done gradually and " very , very carefully			2
" " the president has been clear about where he wants to go and what he thinks needs to be done , " @entity2 said in april at the @entity76 when asked about changing the law			1
" but i think that he is approaching this in a deliberate and cautious manner , so that if we do go down that road , we do it right and we do it in a way that mitigates any downsides , problems that might be associated with it			0
" at least one member of the @entity28 -- gen. @entity92 , commandant of the @entity93 -- has expressed reservations in the past about repealing the law			0
in november , @entity92 said through a spokesman : " our @entity93 are currently engaged in two fights , and our focus should not be drawn away from those priorities			0
" some @entity16 opposition already is clear			2
sen. @entity102 , @entity103 , a former @entity104 pilot , released a statement after wednesday night 's @entity15 saying " it would be a mistake " to repeal the law			0
" this successful policy has been in effect for over 15 years , and it is well understood and predominantly supported by our military at all levels , " @entity102 's statement said , later adding : " at a time when our armed forces are fighting and sacrificing on the battlefield , now is not the time to abandon the policy			2
" others support the change			0
gen. @entity122 , former chairman of the @entity28 , said it was time to repeal the law			0
" as a nation built on the principal of equality , we should recognize and welcome change that will build a stronger more cohesive military , " @entity122 said in a letter sent to sen. @entity126 , @entity128 - @entity127 , who supports repealing the policy			0
the @entity136 , an organization that works with those affected by the " do n't ask , do n't tell " law , praised @entity13 's call for repeal			0
" we very much need a sense of urgency to get this done in 2010 , " the group said , later adding : " the @entity146 public , including conservatives , is overwhelmingly with the commander in chief on this one			0
