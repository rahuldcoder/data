president @entity0 will speak to the nation tuesday , trying to build public support for a military strike against @entity4			1
his request to @entity6 to endorse action reaches the @entity8 and @entity9 at an extraordinarily difficult moment			0
vote counts suggest that the president might not win the support he is seeking			2
democrats and @entity15 are uncertain about backing the president			2
the public remains skeptical as well			2
according to one @entity20 poll , only 42 % of the public endorsed using military force against @entity4			1
after @entity23 and @entity24 , the nation is weary of war			1
the bar has been raised for further intervention			0
although presidential speeches rarely are able to fundamentally reshape public opinion , @entity0 must give his strongest effort if he does not want to end up in an embarrassing situation for his administration and one that could undercut the military effort that he is proposing			1
if @entity0 is going to deliver a speech that matters , he must answer some basic questions about the @entity4 intervention : why are we entering this conflict ? for many @entity41 , the arguments behind @entity41 intervention in @entity4 remain murky			1
this is not just about @entity4 being a confusing and complex situation , but also has to do with a general uncertainty about the objectives of @entity41 foreign policy in 2013			1
in each era of foreign policy , policymakers have put forth strong ideological arguments that framed public policy about war and peace			1
each period had substantial numbers of dissenters , but at least there was something concrete to argue about			0
during the 1930s and early 1940s , the fight against fascism was the driving force behind decisions about intervention			0
" yesterday , december 7 , 1941 -- a date which will live in infamy -- the @entity41 was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the @entity69 , " president @entity63 explained the next day , when asking @entity6 for a declaration of war			1
from the mid- 1940s through the late 1980s , the fight against communism was the focal point of policy			0
since that time , the objectives of @entity41 foreign policy have been less clear			2
when president @entity77 asked for congressional support to use military power in @entity80 in july 1950 , he said that the conflict in @entity80 " has made it clear , beyond all doubt , that the international communist movement is willing to use armed invasion , to conquer independent nations			2
" in the early 1990s , policymakers turned their attention to rogue states such as @entity24 that were said to pose dangers to the stability of key regions			0
after 9/11 , attention turned to international terrorist networks like @entity95			0
on september 20 , 2001 , president @entity96 told the nation , " the enemy of @entity41 is not our many @entity100 friends			1
it is not our many @entity104 friends			0
our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every government that supports them			0
" the larger framework surrounding the @entity4 intervention is less clear			2
the administration has offered a number of arguments as to why the @entity41 needs to intervene , from the message it would send to @entity116 about nuclear weapons , to the urgency of responding to gross violations of human rights			1
the president must offer a compelling reason why a situation such as this deserves national resources			2
if humanitarian interventions are to become a new norm , the president should make the case and offer a set of coherent principles for future conflicts			0
what is the justification for this intervention and is it based on sound intelligence ? one of the main sources of public cynicism about @entity41 foreign policy comes from the fact that presidents have often used incorrect information or purposely flawed data to justify military operations that result in huge human and financial costs			1
@entity41 history is filled with such examples			2
the @entity149 in 1964 , which provided president @entity150 the blanket authority he needed to expand @entity41 's presence in @entity153 and the region , was based on spurious data about alleged attacks on @entity158 destroyers by the @entity159			1
@entity6 gave @entity150 wide - ranging authority to conduct military operations			0
it was " like grandma 's nightshirt , it covered everything , " he later said			0
president @entity96 's request to @entity6 for the authorization to use force in @entity24 in 2003 was justified through incorrect intelligence about the presence of weapons of mass destruction and untrue reports of connections between @entity176 and @entity177			2
@entity0 , who ran his 2008 campaign based on criticism of all the problems with @entity96 's war , needs to demonstrate to the public that he has made a decision based on the soundest of evidence			1
the revelations about the @entity187 have already raised public skepticism about the discrepancy between what @entity0 says in public and what he does behind the scenes			1
without revealing sensitive information to the public , it is important that the president make a convincing case that the intelligence behind this decision is sound , that it has been examined and cross-examined , that the @entity4 government did use chemical weapons and that the @entity4 do pose a substantial threat to the region			1
he needs to explain why chemical weapons pose a threat that deserves a military strike as opposed to other weapons or mechanisms of mass destruction			0
why act here , but not with regard to other atrocities or risks ? the nation can not afford another war based on false premises			0
what is the mission ? presidents have gone into many wars without a clear sense of what they hope to achieve			0
once troops are sent into a war or even after the @entity226 is sent in to strike targets , conflicts can take unpredictable turns and escalate quickly			0
if the administration does n't articulate a clear sense of what it hopes to accomplish at the outset , it allows for open - ended possibilities for escalation			0
when president @entity238 went to war with @entity24 in 1990 , the confusion over the objectives led to great frustration when @entity41 saw that @entity176 remained in power after the celebrations of @entity41 victory had taken place			1
@entity96 's son 's war in @entity24 proved even more frustrating , as there was growing awareness that the administration was entering into a much broader mission of nation - building than many @entity41 had anticipated			1
when the new government that emerged from the rubble in @entity24 remained unstable and the @entity41 seemed to be pouring endless resources into the country , many @entity41 were left with a sense that the operation had not been worthwhile			2
@entity0 ca n't afford to make the the mistake of leaving his objectives ill - defined			1
it is possible that quick and targeted airstrikes will destroy the chemical weapons capacity of the @entity4 , though that would still leave in place a dictator whom the president has characterized as inhumane and brutal			1
it is also possible that airstrikes would result in retaliation that would trigger a bigger conflict , which would in turn create greater pressure for regime change			0
the president did the right thing by engaging @entity6 in this decision rather than trying to circumvent the legislative branch			0
but in this case , with the memories of @entity24 looming large , he wo n't have luck just asking for blind support			0
in his speech , the president must answer these questions in simple and direct terms			1
this would do a great deal to build confidence in the operation , and to build a foundation for longer term support of this intervention should it be needed .			0

@entity292 : president @entity0 must answer basic questions to sell @entity4 move to the public
war - weary @entity41 want to know why @entity41 should intervene , he says
@entity292 : @entity0 needs to explain reliability of intelligence , *outline* the aims of the mission
