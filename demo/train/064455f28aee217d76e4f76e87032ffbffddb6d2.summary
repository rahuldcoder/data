-- i was a young traveling correspondent in the closing months of the @entity2 , stunned like any other visitor from the @entity4 at the cruel tyranny that had endured for so many years in so many countries , amazed at how quickly it was toppled			2
i remember in particular the day the @entity8 came down			1
i just did n't realize it at the time			2
the @entity8 was n't simply a phrase made famous by @entity11 to describe the line separating the @entity14 - dominated eastern @entity13 from the sovereign nations of the west			1
it was literally a guarded barrier that millions of people could n't cross because they were imprisoned in their home countries			0
but by 1988 , reformers inside the @entity22 government decided to open their border to the west and allow @entity22 to leave for @entity25			1
the next year they began allowing @entity26 on @entity22 soil to leave for @entity25 as well			2
but one thing stood in the way : @entity30			2
the route from @entity26 to @entity22 ran right through it			0
the government in @entity34 was n't looking to the west ; it was closer to the hardliners in @entity38 than the reformers in @entity40			1
it was n't inclined to open up			0
some @entity26 would n't wait			0
in the summer of 1989 , they began seeking refuge in the @entity45 embassy in @entity34			1
by august , there were thousands of them , camped out in the cramped confines of the embassy grounds			0
@entity51 authorities let some leave the country but tried to stop any more from coming in			0
by november 4 , the border was opened for @entity26 , even while it still stood as a barrier to the citizens of @entity30 themselves			1
i can recall that morning in @entity34 , watching @entity59 leave the crowded embassy grounds and board buses for their trip to @entity45			1
the people of @entity34 stopped in their tracks to watch them take that coveted journey to freedom			2
the @entity51 around me put down their shopping bags , briefcases and packages and broke into spontaneous applause			0
thousands of people , who had been prisoners , had found a safe , legal way to escape			0
less than a week later , the @entity73 was open			0
the @entity8 had collapsed .			1

@entity0 *'s* @entity75 recalls the day the @entity8 fell
line between @entity14 - dominated eastern @entity13 and nations of the west stood until 1988
east @entity59 began seeking refuge in @entity34 in the summer of 1989
finally by november , the @entity8 had collapsed
