-- here 's a fact that may surprise people : garbage collecting is one of the most dangerous jobs you can do			2
a bulldozer shuffles more trash on to a heap on a landfill in @entity11			2
according to the @entity16 @entity15 , the people who collect our trash are carrying out " high - hazard " roles			1
and staggeringly , they are three times more likely to be killed at work than the police or fire services are , according to @entity22			0
much of this could have to do with a fairly basic fact : the majority of our trash goes to landfills , and landfills have been accused of ( among other things ) being breeding grounds for disease			2
if landfills do leak , leachate -- a toxic substance -- is released into the groundwater and soil , leading to the possibility that local drinking water supplies could get contaminated			2
and one of the contaminants that can potentially escape into the water supply is vinyl chloride , a human carcinogen			0
according to @entity22 , there have been higher incidences of liver cancer , bladder cancer , lung cancer , leukemia and @entity52 's lymphoma among adults that live within close vicinity of landfills -- while children have been known to be born with birth defects			1
modern landfills are now installed with filtering systems , so they in theory should n't leak at all			2
but as far as the old ones are concerned , that 's not always necessarily the case , according to a @entity16 @entity65 ( @entity65 ) report in 1987 which said : " eventually all landfills leak "			1
' landfill gas ' aside from leachate , there is , of course , the massive environmental risk associated with landfills			1
landfills give out what is commonly referred to as " landfill gas , " made up 50 percent to 60 percent methane and 35 percent to 40 percent carbon dioxide ( @entity78 )			1
methane is more than 20 times more powerful than @entity78 when it comes to heating the atmosphere , scientists say			2
and landfills are releasing enough of it to earn them the title of biggest methane producers in the world			1
( the world 's methane levels have also tripled in the last 150 years , according to @entity91 ) according to the @entity65 , in 2000 , global landfills accounted for more than 730 million metric tons of co2 equivalent -- representing more than 12 percent of global methane emissions			2
( the @entity16 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 together contributed 42 percent of the world 's landfill - generated methane emissions			1
) and the figures are going to keep growing , the @entity65 says , by 9 percent between 2005 and 2020			0
just 1 million tons of waste in a landfill produces enough methane , that if you removed it from the atmosphere , the @entity65 says , it would be the same as taking 8,800 cars off the road			1
waste varies by nation the amount we send to landfill varies vastly from one country to another , but in sheer number of tons , the clear leaders are @entity97 and the @entity121			1
according to @entity123 figures , the @entity16 sends 53.4 percent percent of its municipal waste ( 222 million tons ) to landfills , while @entity97 is catching up , with 43 percent of its waste going to landfills ( 148 million tons )			1
( @entity97 has a growing waste problem , with now 65 percent of its cities on the edge of landfills , according to @entity132			1
) it is estimated that the @entity16 alone could have around 10,000 abandoned landfills which are a potential hazard to those that live nearby			1
but according to the @entity123 @entity139 ( @entity140 ) , that number could be even higher			2
according to @entity140 , " tens of thousands of square kilometers of land " worldwide have been contaminated to date by inadequate landfills and the unsafe handling of hazardous waste			1
the agency says the @entity16 could have as many as 40,000 of them , with six @entity148 countries having another 55,000			1
( according to @entity150 , less than 10 percent to 15 percent of closed @entity16 landfills ever get redeveloped			1
) the developing world 's landfill problems are getting increasingly severe , too , @entity140 says			0
it points out that in @entity155 , two - fifths of landfills that exist " do not meet even minimum standards , and are little more than rubbish tips , " @entity140 says			0
while in @entity95 , anything up to 80 percent of solid waste is left out in the open , presumably untreated			0
some governments around the world have come to the conclusion in recent years that securing old landfills -- by redeveloping them ( or regenerating , as it is known ) into something else -- is better than doing nothing at all			0
landfills have been redeveloped over the years with varying degrees of success			0
( around 70 golf courses in the @entity16 used to be landfill sites , according to @entity150 )			1
according to the @entity176 newspaper , a landfill site in @entity174 has drawn ire from locals over the years who suspect that it 's toxic waste could be responsible for @entity183 's syndrome births in the surrounding areas			2
the locals have more reason to be cheerful these days , however , since the local county council decided to transform it into the @entity190 's largest urban forest			0
@entity191 is another city in the @entity190 that was heralded for its decision to build a park on top of its old landfill			0
even @entity198 , in @entity199 , which before its closure in 2001 was given the accolade of the world 's biggest landfill ( covering 3.5 square miles , with 225 - feet high towers of trash and allegedly viewable by space ) is being primed for development as an urban paradise -- although it could take up to 20 years to bear fruit			1
according to the @entity214 , the @entity213 ( @entity213 ) , lacking the funding to fully regenerate the fresh kills site , set out to see if it could prompt natural forces to take care of it for them back in the early 1990s			0
@entity213 planted a small number of trees and shrubs to attract birds , bees and small mammals to it in the hope that they in turn could drop more seeds to develop it further			0
( as @entity213 's director said in an interview with @entity214 , " we wanted to find out if we could enlist the birds as landscape architects			0
" ) all seems to be going well there so far			0
but in @entity238 , it 's another story and perhaps there is a lesson here for any governments looking to regenerate their landfills on a more ambitious scale			0
cracks have been appearing in the runway at @entity247 , according to @entity132 , delaying take - offs and disrupting schedules			0
it turns out @entity251 is sitting on a landfill -- which may be sinking			0

@entity97 and @entity16 landfill more waste than any other countries
landfills are the biggest *emitters* of the *greenhouse* gas , methane
higher incidences of cancer , other diseases amongst people living near landfills
" tens of thousands of square kilometers " of land could be contaminated
