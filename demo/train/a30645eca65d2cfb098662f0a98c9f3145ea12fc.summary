@entity1 , @entity0 -- the @entity3 may still be booming but inflation - and skyrocketing prices - is making life tough for the workforce			1
working in the @entity3 is less profitable for expatriate workers because of inflation many expats initially drawn by the region 's tax - free salaries and high standard of living are now feeling the effects of inflation in high rent and living costs			1
all this is making work in @entity20 , @entity21 and the surrounding countries a less attractive proposition than it was a few years ago			2
" the working population here is growing restless and the reasons are obvious , " said @entity24 , editorial director at @entity25			0
" inflation has become a real issue across the region ... salaries have risen but they have n't risen as fast as inflation , which in real terms means you 've had a pay cut , " he continued			2
this means workers are finding it harder to save money and are experiencing a decrease in their standard of living			2
add to that a lack of key social infrastructure like schools and some of the major incentives for people to stay in the region are disappearing			0
@entity25 recently conducted an online survey which found that more than two thirds of workers who responded were more inclined to look for another job this year than in 2007			1
with the @entity3 's economic explosion largely dependent on a combination of skilled and unskilled expatriates -- 20 percent of the workforce in some parts of the region -- there is the added worry that increasingly dissatisfied workers could start looking for jobs in other parts of the world			1
a lack of indigenous workers who can lead the complex infrastructure projects currently being undertaken in the @entity3 is already a problem , and a mass exodus of disenchanted expatriates would have serious knock on effects for business in the region			1
the problems of inflation and keeping experienced workers in the region are intimately connected , according to @entity79 , editor of the @entity80			1
" probably the top two issues for the @entity3 at the moment are a skills shortage and inflation and they 're two sides of the same coin			1
the economy has grown too fast ... and that has delivered inflation			2
the other aspect of that growth is the need to bring in and recruit skills to deliver infrastructure projects , " he said			0
and tougher conditions also mean that it could be harder to continue attracting workers from other parts of the world to the region			0
but workers in the @entity3 are not completely motivated by financial concerns , according the the @entity105 survey			1
it found that while salary is an extremely important motivating factor for employees -- 33 percent of survey respondents said money was their key concern -- it is not the only consideration			2
for the majority of workers , opportunities for promotion -- which remain a strong incentive in the @entity3 's vibrant market -- are the single most important condition for staying in a job , according to @entity123			1
" one of the things [ companies ] should try to do is to encourage an environment where you think you can get somewhere			0
that way you do n't have to rely on just handing out the money to get people to stay in your organization , " he said			0
pressure is also mounting on governments to find solutions to inflation			1
" if governments depend on expats , then how are you going to train and recruit and develop the local work force ? so there is a dichotomy for governments here they have to think for the long term to keep the boom growing , " said @entity79			0
there are a number of initiatives being talked about , ranging from proposals to set a minimum wage to governments setting rent caps on property prices			2
" we 're beginning to hear an increasing amount of businesses calling for a more managed approach to the economic boom particularly on the implementation of infrastructure projects , " @entity79 explained			0
" growing economies such as @entity158 are learning from @entity20 's mistakes and looking to a much more structured , strategic approach to development , " he continued			0
@entity123 believes many of the region 's problems are short to medium term -- like expensive housing which will resolve itself by 2010 when more accommodation comes onto the market quenching demand and therefore reducing prices			0
he is convinced huge growth and an exciting environment will continue to bring expatriate workers to the @entity3			1
" walk around ... @entity20 or @entity158 or @entity173 , @entity21 and you find these cities buzzing and for many people that is the most important thing , so i think you will always find people coming here , " said @entity24 , " this region needs expatriate workers just as much as expatriate workers need this market			1
and i think that 's ultimately the truth			0
