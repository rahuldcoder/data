@entity0 , @entity1 -- the six @entity4 rangers suddenly crouched , whispering , on their way up the rocky mountain trail			1
it was early friday afternoon , the first day of the @entity8 , and the rangers were out in force , hiking to the spot where dozens of volunteers worked with picks and shovels to move and bury @entity0 's makeshift water line			1
shhh ! look ! do you see it ? the rangers stopped in their tracks			0
binoculars emerged from pockets , and fingers pointed to a stand of trees			0
and there it was , a @entity27 spotted owl , perched high in a pine tree			1
it was a male , the rangers said , with his back turned to the intruders			0
but mostly , the owl seemed to be watching the nest in a nearby sycamore tree where his mate tended to an owlet			0
the owl is a threatened species , and until a few days ago its presence in fire - scorched @entity43 was a matter of speculation			2
but now that it has surfaced , the owl could be a game - changer in the water war between the @entity4 and the @entity48 city made famous by the 30 - second gunfight at the @entity50			1
@entity0 is trying to repair a 26 - mile pipeline that has brought mountain spring water into the city since 1881			1
it was damaged during last summer 's @entity53 and monsoon rains that brought mud , water and boulders crashing down the denuded slopes			1
the @entity59 , where owls nest in the trees above @entity0 's pipeline , was hit particularly hard			1
sections of pipeline simply vanished , and @entity0 's reservoir ran dry by august			1
@entity66 , project manager for the @entity0 pipeline , said the repaired pipeline needs to be shored up or it surely will be washed away when the monsoon rains return next month			1
planned tasks for the shovel brigade include reinforcing the spring and diverting its flow by using boulders , sand , downed trees and other flood debris			2
as for the owl , nobody could say for certain after the fire whether it would return			0
but it 's the big reason why the @entity4 would n't simply hand @entity0 a permit to use heavy construction equipment to fix the pipeline			1
@entity0 responded by taking the feds to court			0
since then , the conflict has escalated , taking on a life of its own			0
@entity0 now asserts that it owns 25 springs in the @entity91 and should n't have to ask anyone for permission to maintain its own water line			1
the @entity4 says @entity0 holds permits for just five springs , and it argues the city is trying to exploit a natural disaster to expand its water system			1
with the conservative @entity101 taking on @entity0 's legal work , the court battle has blossomed into a full - blown states rights dispute			1
@entity0 is getting the attention of activists from @entity106 , @entity107 and other @entity109 states who say the federal government has gone too far			0
it has become ground zero in a rekindled @entity113			0
" i 'd love to say that this is a partisan issue and that if this administration changes , it 's going to be all sweetness and light , " said @entity114 , a @entity0 native who now heads the @entity115			2
" but i have 22 years of experience telling me otherwise			0
it 's not a partisan issue			0
" @entity114 said she has battled the @entity4 often on behalf of ranchers in her state and has found that " people in @entity128 just do n't understand the @entity48			1
they do n't understand the wide open spaces and how we live and how we manage the land			0
" the federal government controls millions of acres in the @entity48 , and some folks believe the feds have reneged on a promise to turn over large swaths to local control once statehood was achieved			0
it 's a battle cry once made by oilmen and ranchers , and now state and local governments are taking up the cause			0
the leaders of the @entity148 , which in 2000 used volunteer muscle power to move a boulder and reopen a wilderness road near @entity152 , @entity153 , rallied to @entity0 's side			1
a nonprofit organization was set up , and @entity0 so far has received $ 2,000 in donations and about 400 shovels			0
the @entity148 contingent then traveled to @entity0 , hiked up the mountain and labored on the pipeline			2
so did @entity161 , a state representative from @entity106 , who won passage of legislation that seeks to turn over federal land to his state			0
he says the conflict playing out in @entity0 is an example of the @entity4 dictating to , rather than working with , local government officials			2
he says the feds suddenly cut off @entity0 's access to springs and roads the city has maintained for 130 years under " an arbitrary and irrational federal policy			1
" as a result , @entity161 said , @entity0 " is minutes away from going up in smoke " because it is " a wooden town in the middle of the desert in the middle of a drought			0
" at the center of the debate is the @entity27 spotted owl			1
" what is more important , owls or the people of @entity0 ? " @entity189 , a @entity4 supervisor who oversees the wilderness , was asked in court earlier this year			1
@entity192 responded that there was no easy answer , which left jaws dropping on @entity0 's side of the courtroom			1
so far , the @entity4 had been winning in court ; @entity0 's request for an emergency injunction went all the way to the @entity203 @entity202 but was turned down			1
the feds seemed to be losing in the court of public opinion , though			0
@entity0 tells a compelling story , portraying the @entity4 as a rogue agency of obstructionist , tree - hugging bureaucrats			2
the @entity4 had offered little comment , and when it did say something , it sounded to the people of @entity0 , well , tree - hugging and bureaucratic			2
but the rangers came out in force on friday , presenting their helpful side			0
a group of @entity4 firefighters hiked up the mountain and used a two - man crosscut saw to take down a tree and clear a path for the pipeline			2
while everyone agrees the relationship between @entity0 city officials and @entity4 rangers has improved in recent weeks , their differences simmer just below the surface			1
the agency is working with the city to come up with a plan to keep water flowing to @entity0 , but it is n't standing down			1
the @entity4 granted permits thursday for the city to bring the all - volunteer shovel brigade into the canyon to shore up the pipeline			1
@entity0 has until 8 p.m. saturday to finish the job			0
and so , under an unforgiving desert sun , about 100 people -- including @entity48 cowboy types with monikers such as " whiskers " and " @entity240 " -- gathered at @entity0 's old high school football field friday for the first day of an event that was billed as part protest and part work party			1
@entity114 , who heads the cattle growers group , grew up in @entity0 and remembers playing powder puff football on that field during the 1970s			2
her great - grandfather was among @entity0 's first settlers and made a name for himself in banking and ranching , but she considers herself " an economic refugee from @entity1			1
" she says she knows all too well how difficult navigating @entity4 regulations can be			0
" the idea that the @entity4 is trying to take water away from my hometown is just beyond words , " she said			2
" i 'm very proud to be here today to help and to fight			0
we 're going to fix this , and the @entity4 is going to listen			2
" the three - mile hike up the mountain was grueling in the 100 - degree heat			0
the trail is steep and rocky , and some of the volunteers did n't make it to the top			0
those who did found themselves moving boulders , digging trenches and sliding on gravelly slopes			0
soaked with sweat , they staggered down the mountain after a couple of hours of hard labor			0
" it 's just a lot of manual labor , " said @entity278 , president of @entity0 's @entity280 post			1
it was frustrating , he said , because " we should n't be doing it by manual labor , we should be using equipment			0
" his friend @entity287 , a fellow veteran , said he considered it his " patriotic duty " to stand up for @entity0 's water rights			1
meanwhile , @entity0 's cause has found a champion in @entity128			1
@entity203 rep. @entity292 , an @entity1 @entity293 , recently introduced @entity294 , the @entity295			0
it proposes to set aside @entity4 restrictions against the use of construction equipment during state - declared water emergencies			2
@entity292 and @entity300 , @entity0 's archivist , were among the witnesses who testified before a subcommittee of the @entity303 on friday			2
@entity292 said : " the unforeseen consequences of federal laws and regulations threaten to do something outlaws , economic busts and the @entity1 desert could n't : kill the town too tough to die			2

volunteer shovel brigade heads to hills to fix @entity0 water line by hand
pipeline damaged by fire and monsoon rains lies in *protected* wilderness area
