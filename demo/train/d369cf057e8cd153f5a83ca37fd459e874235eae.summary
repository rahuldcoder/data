@entity0 -- bomb plots targeting the @entity4 and the city 's subway were among more than 50 terrorist acts worldwide thwarted by top - secret surveillance programs since the 2001 @entity10 attacks on the @entity11 , security officials said tuesday			1
the startling details disclosed at a @entity14 intelligence committee hearing reflected a unified effort by the @entity17 administration and legislators to defend the telephone and e-mail surveillance made public this month by classified leaks to newspapers			1
testimony by gen. @entity24 , the @entity26 director , as well as officials from the @entity28 , @entity29 and the director of national intelligence office called the programs created under the @entity32 in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks a vital tool against terrorist plots			1
joined by panel chairman rep. @entity38 and other legislators , they condemned the document leaks by former government contractor @entity42 as harmful to the @entity11 and its allies			2
the leaks also led to what officials called widespread public misinformation about the surveillance programs that necessitated the relatively rare open hearing by the intelligence panel , where they detailed previously classified information in order to set the record straight			1
it was the most comprehensive and specific defense of the surveillance methods that have come under ferocious criticism from civil liberties groups , some members of @entity60 and others concerned about the reach of government into the private lives of citizens			2
national security and law enforcement officials repeated that the programs are tightly run with significant regulation and oversight by federal judges and @entity60			1
addressing the most basic questions that have emerged , @entity38 asked @entity24 if intelligence workers have the ability to simply " flip a switch " in order to listen to phone calls or read the emails of @entity11			2
when @entity24 replied " no , " @entity38 asked again to reinforce the message for anyone listening			0
" so the technology does not exist for any individual or group of individuals at the @entity26 to flip a switch to listen to @entity11 ' phone calls or read their e-mails ? " he repeated			1
" that is correct , " @entity24 answered			0
he and others also asserted that the leaks were egregious and carry huge consequences for national security			1
" i think it was irreversible and significant damage to this nation , " @entity24 said when questioned by rep. @entity93			0
" has this helped @entity11 's enemies ? " the conservative @entity98 @entity97 asked			1
" i believe it has and i believe it will hurt us and our allies , " @entity24 said			0
president @entity17 has defended the programs as necessary in an era of terror			2
in an interview with @entity109 ' @entity108 broadcast on monday night , @entity17 said the situation requires a national debate on the balance between security and privacy			2
@entity17 bristles at suggestion he 's shifted on snooping @entity24 told a @entity118 committee last week that the surveillance programs helped stop dozens of terror plots , but he was unable then to provide classified details			1
under pressure from @entity38 and other legislators , @entity24 joined law enforcement officials tuesday in making public some declassified details of the @entity32 provisions			1
in recent years , @entity24 said , information " gathered from these programs provided government with critical leads to prevent over 50 potential terrorist events in more than 20 countries around the world			1
" details of most of the thwarted terrorism acts remain secret , but national security officials said they were working on declassifying more information and could have a report to @entity60 as early as this week			1
@entity139 , the deputy @entity28 director , detailed how email surveillance of foreigners under one program helped authorities discover the two @entity146 plots			1
in the fall of 2009 , @entity147 said , the @entity26 intercepted an e-mail from a suspected terrorist in @entity151			1
that person was talking with someone in the @entity11 " about perfecting a recipe for explosives , " he said			0
authorities identified @entity159 - born @entity158 of @entity160			0
the @entity28 followed him to @entity146 and eventually broke up planning to attack the city 's subway system			1
@entity158 pleaded guilty and is currently in prison			0
@entity42 claims online @entity17 expanded ' abusive ' security in the other @entity146 case , the @entity26 was monitoring a " known extremist " in @entity167 who was in contact with a person in the @entity11 , @entity147 said			1
the @entity28 detected " nascent plotting " to bomb the stock exchange , long considered a target of terrorists , and the plotters were later convicted , according to @entity147			1
he also said e-mail surveillance disrupted an effort to attack the office of a @entity181 newspaper that was threatened for publishing a cartoon of the @entity183 in 2006			2
the plot involved @entity185 , a @entity11 citizen living in @entity186			0
the @entity28 received intelligence at the time regarding his possible involvement in the 2008 @entity190 terror attack that killed 164 people , @entity147 said			2
the @entity26 , through surveillance of an @entity10 - affiliated terrorist , found that @entity185 was working on a plot to bomb the newspaper			1
@entity185 later confessed to conducting surveillance and was convicted			2
he also pleaded guilty to conducting surveillance in the @entity190 case			2
in a fourth case , secret surveillance " tipped us off " to a person who had indirect contacts with a known terrorist group overseas , @entity147 said			1
" we were able to reopen this investigation , identify additional individuals through the legal process and were able to disrupt this terrorist activity , " @entity147 said			2
in an exchange with @entity147 , rep. @entity210 of @entity211 said the case involved someone financing a designated terrorist group in @entity215			1
@entity38 , who scheduled the hearing in recent days after @entity24 pledged to declassify information on terror plots thwarted by the secret programs , said it was necessary to clear up public confusion caused by misinformation			1
" if half the things i read in blog and other places were true , i would n't support it , " the @entity223 @entity97 said , later adding that skeptics " have no understanding " of what is going on			0
in particular , he said @entity42 disclosed only a sliver of information about the programs without knowing the full extent of what they did and the strict regulation and oversight of them			2
" none of the things he talked about were accurate , " @entity38 said of @entity42			0
the hearing came one day after @entity42 defended his actions in leaking classified documents to @entity248 's @entity247 newpaper and the @entity249			0
in a series of blog posts on the @entity247 website , the 29 - year - old @entity42 said he disclosed the information because @entity17 worsened " abusive " surveillance practices instead of curtailing them as he promised as a presidential candidate			0
the former @entity26 contractor insisted that @entity11 authorities have access to phone calls , e-mails and other communications far beyond constitutional bounds			1
while he said legal restrictions can be easily skirted by analysts at the @entity26 , @entity28 and @entity266 , @entity42 stopped short of accusing authorities of violating specific laws			1
instead , he said toothless regulations and policies were to blame for what he called " suspicionless surveillance , " and he warned that policies can be changed to allow further abuses			0
at tuesday 's hearing , officials detailed how the programs operate and the judicial and legislative oversight involved , repeating several times how access to the content of e-mails or telephone calls -- or even the names of people involved -- required authorization			1
deputy attorney general @entity286 noted that basic phone records collected under @entity288 of the @entity32 were not protected by @entity290 rights to privacy , citing a 1979 @entity293 ruling			0
in the case , @entity295 , the justices ruled that information about telephone calls -- such as their time and duration -- was different from the content of the calls and therefore not protected under the @entity290			0
@entity286 also provided a detailed description of the legal framework of the programs , noting that the anti-terrorism surveillance effort is not " off the books " or " hidden away			2
" " this is part of what government puts together and discusses , " he said			0
it is overseen by three branches of our government -- the @entity312 , the @entity315 , and the @entity316			0
" he described the @entity11 phone records collected under @entity288 as basic information " just like what you would get in your own phone bill			0
" " it is the number that was dialed from , the number that was dialed to , the date and the length of time			0
that 's all we get , " he said			0
" we do not get the identity of any of the parties to this phone call			0
we do n't get any cell site or location information as to where any of these phones were located			0
and , most importantly , and you 're probably going to hear this about 100 times today , we do n't get any content under this			0
we do n't listen in on anybody 's calls under this program at all			0
" tech companies jockey to seem the most transparent instead , it takes permission from a special court to get access to further information , based on a verifiable link to a terrorism investigation , @entity286 explained			0
such links have mostly come from another surveillance program that collects communications information of foreign terrorism suspects living overseas			0
critics question the need to store the vast amount of @entity11 phone records , saying it creates a database prone to abuses and provides little return for the risk and privacy concerns			0
@entity24 said tuesday the phone database played a role in stopping 10 terrorist acts since the 9/11 attacks			1
at the same time , he and other officials said there were no cases they knew of in which anyone willfully misused the system to access information			2
" if you 're looking for the needle in a haystack , " @entity286 said , " you have to have the haystack			1
