@entity0 -- the @entity2 have just played their signature anthem , " where is my mind			1
" as the crowd begs for an encore , @entity6 stands alone at center stage , an uncharacteristic grin spread across his usually enigmatic features			1
guitarist @entity12 and drummer @entity13 are already heading for the wings , while their new touring bassist , @entity15 , slips into the crowd , eager to shake hands with rabid fans			0
the @entity2 are in the midst of headlining a series of sold - out club dates and festival appearances in support of " @entity24 , " their first collection of new music in 22 years			1
it 's also their first tour without original bassist @entity29 , whose departure from the quartet was announced in june			1
despite some tensions in the past , her decision blindsided her bandmates			0
photos : a short history of punk " she just said , ' i 'm leaving on the next flight tomorrow , ' " recalls @entity6 , aka @entity6			1
" and so there was nothing really to say			0
we just said , ' ok			0
' it was just as simple and as basic as that			0
" and so @entity47 's beloved indie rock band embarked on a new chapter of its storied career			1
bursting out of the @entity51 underground in the late ' 80s with an irresistible yin - yang of brash guitars and dreamy popscapes , the @entity2 imploded before they could hit the big time -- but not before laying the sonic groundwork for such alternative acts as @entity59 and @entity60			1
with great fanfare , the @entity2 reunited in 2004 for a world tour -- a triumphant victory lap that somehow stretched into a whopping seven - year run			1
aging hipsters and musically precocious twentysomethings welcomed the return of " @entity68 , " " @entity70 " and other favorites , but it also left them yearning for fresh material			2
they got it with " @entity2 , " a surprise single that bombarded unsuspecting inboxes as a free download in late june			1
in early september , four additional songs hit the @entity77 , this time in a package generically titled " @entity24			0
" and there 's more on the way			2
@entity1 gets the backstory in a rooftop conversation with @entity6 , @entity83 and @entity13 before a recent show in @entity0			1
they share how they turned @entity83 's hotel room into a secret recording studio , open up about the departure of @entity29 and give a progress report on her replacement , @entity15 ( from the @entity0 pop - punk trio @entity92 )			1
@entity1 : ever since your 2004 reunion , fans were hoping for some new music			2
rumor has it that was kicked into gear when the @entity2 were in @entity101 headlining at a casino , and did n't want to be thought of as an oldies act			1
@entity13 : in @entity101 , those are the venues			0
it 's not that we became a casino band , but it was almost equating us to that			1
@entity109 , oh no ! so that was just a good impetus to think , " ok , we 've got to do something			0
" @entity1 : when the new music came out on your website , did you read the comments ? @entity6 ( aka " @entity6 " ) : i think i read the comments			1
our @entity120 feed is probably where i get most of my online satisfaction , as far as people blogging or commenting about things			0
@entity12 : i look at the comments			0
i like the negative ones			0
it 's like when i 'm buying @entity128 stuff			2
i look at the negative reviews			0
but they 're just judging a book by its cover , really -- that a member is gone , and what 's that got to do with " @entity2 ? " @entity1 : was @entity29 's leaving unexpected ? @entity136 : it was a shock , because she was along on the journey with us			1
@entity83 : she was enthusiastic , and then that bomb hit one day			0
@entity1 : did she tell you in person ? @entity6 : yeah			1
we used to go to get a coffee in the village , the little town that we were recording near			0
everyone would go there looking for their coffee , so inevitably , one , or two , or three or four band members would be there			2
we were there , and she just said , " i 'm leaving on the next flight tomorrow			0
" and so , you know , there was nothing really to say			0
we just said , " ok			0
" it was just as simple and as basic as that			0
@entity1 : did she give a reason , or indicate that she might be back at some point ? @entity6 : i think when someone makes a big decision like that , it takes a lot of guts to kind of tell the people that you have to tell face - to - face , which is what she did			1
i know that when the band broke up the first time around , i sort of broke up the band , but i did n't have the guts to do that			2
i had to send a message and hope for the best , because it feels like a confrontation , or you feel embarrassed , or you do n't want to let people down , you know what i mean ? you know they 're going to be disappointed , so i think it probably took a lot of guts for her to personally go , " i 'm out , " and not just do it in an email			0
@entity1 : has she heard the new music ? @entity136 : i do n't know			2
@entity1 : having a female presence in the band has been an important part of the @entity2			1
@entity6 : it 's a nice thing to have a yin and a yang in certain situations			1
it 's always been a part of the way we present our music , and i think people like it			1
it puts a lot of things into perspective having both sexes represented on stage			0
it 's just a totally different dynamic -- not only in terms of what the band is doing , but the way people receive it			1
@entity1 : " @entity224 " is a song on the new ep			2
is it an ode to the indie fans out there , or anxiety over whether they 'll accept the new material ? @entity6 : there 's that little punk rock girl that 's out there			1
she 's very representative of a music fan , especially if you 're a boy			1
if you 're a guy , that punk rock girl is kind of like , " aww , the little cute punk rock girl with all her make - up , and all her stuff on , going to the show			2
" there 's something about it that is very adorable			2
you fall in love with those people			0
@entity1 : @entity6 , you and @entity12 went back to the old neighborhood and set up a recording studio in @entity12 's hotel in @entity251			1
@entity6 : in western @entity251 , in the @entity256 - @entity255 area where @entity12 and i first met in college			1
@entity1 : was there some residual magic in the old neighborhood ? @entity6 : probably			1
it 's probably not magic , but there are a lot of real things that affect life , whether it 's a full moon , or whether it 's what the air is like , or what the soil is like somewhere , what the people are like in a particular area			2
there are a lot of things that you kind of do n't notice that probably actually have an effect			0
it was by coincidence that we were there			0
we did n't plan it -- not consciously , anyway			0
the vocals for " @entity224 " are from @entity12 's hotel room there			2
@entity1 : how 's it working out with @entity15 doing the live shows ? @entity6 : every musician brings their thing to the table			1
i personally like working with her			0
she has a really good work ethic			0
she likes to rock out , she likes to hit hard , she likes to play			0
i enjoy working with her because she has a good attitude			0
@entity1 : if there 's an " @entity24 , " does that mean there 's also an " @entity298 " and an " @entity299 ? " @entity6 : it 's all one big album , you know			1
@entity1 : will you be spending another seven years on the road ? @entity83 : you know , i do n't want to sound corny , but it 's up to @entity224			2
i mean , she 's the greatest gatekeeper of all .			2
