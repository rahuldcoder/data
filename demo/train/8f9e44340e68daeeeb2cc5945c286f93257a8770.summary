-- officials in @entity2 , @entity3 , have beaten construction delays , permit problems and the ever - present threat of hurricanes to arrive at this day : a new airport that will open the region to the world and bring in planeloads of tourism dollars			1
but as regular air service begins sunday , authorities never thought they 'd have to contend with a new threat : an oil spill in the @entity17 that continues to gush thousands of gallons of crude every day			1
" we 've been getting calls ever since the oil spill occurred , " said @entity20 of the @entity21			2
" you know , wondering about their vacation plans			0
" tourism , @entity20 said , is the largest industry in @entity2			0
the $ 318 - million @entity28 is the first international airport to open in the country since 1997			1
" it is really going to be an economic driver for all of northwest @entity3 's economy for years to come , " he said			1
the new airport is expected to generate approximately $ 80 million in new state revenues over the first 20 years of operation			2
but the challenge , now , is to convince tourists that the water is clean			0
" we 'll get through the oil spill , " @entity20 said			0
" there 's no oil on @entity44 or any of the beaches in northwest @entity3			2
" indeed , the spill is more than 100 miles away from @entity44 's coastline			0
local officials have said that if it comes ashore , they will swiftly deal with it			0
yet , beach towns across the @entity52 have seen business slide precipitously as tar balls -- pieces of emulsified oil -- wash ashore along the coasts of @entity58 and @entity59			0
@entity3 gov. @entity60 asked oil company @entity61 , which owns the damaged well at the heart of the slick , to pay for a $ 35 million advertising blitz to reassure tourists that @entity3 beaches remain untarnished by the spill			1
oil has been gushing into the @entity17 at the rate of about 5,000 barrels a day ( 210,000 gallons ) since late april , when the drill rig @entity71 blew up and sank about 40 miles off @entity72			2
some estimates have put the amount of oil spewing from the well far higher			0
eleven workers are missing and presumed dead after the explosion and sinking , and the cause has not been determined			0
efforts to shut down the well that was ripped open by the accident have failed so far , though @entity61 says it has been able to capture some of the escaping oil and pump it to a ship on the surface			2
the company also said it will continue using a controversial subsea dispersant to break up the plume of oil , pushing back against a directive from the @entity87 to find a less toxic alternative , the @entity87 indicated saturday			1
the @entity87 issued the directive on thursday , ordering @entity61 to find within 24 hours a less toxic but equally effective chemical than its current product , @entity95 , and one that is available in sufficient quantities			1
the directive also gave the company 72 hours to stop applying it to the undersea gusher			0
@entity95 has been rated more toxic and less effective than many others on the list of 18 @entity87 - approved dispersants , according to testimony at a congressional hearing wednesday			1
the @entity87 released @entity61 's response to the mandate on saturday			1
the response , which @entity61 submitted late thursday night , said that the oil company identified the only other effective , less toxic alternative available in mass quantities as @entity111 4			1
however , @entity61 said the @entity111 product " contains a small amount of a chemical that may degrade to a nonylphenol			2
" @entity116 is an organic chemical that is toxic to aquatic life and may persist in the environment for years			0
@entity95 , however , " does not contain chemicals that degrade into @entity122 ( and ) the manufacturer indicates that @entity95 reaches its maximum bio-degradability within 28 days of application " and does not persist in the environment , @entity61 's response said			1
" based on the information that is available today , @entity61 continues to believe that @entity95 was the best and most appropriate choice at the time when the incident occurred , and that @entity95 remains the best option for subsea application , " @entity61 said			1
also saturday , the @entity132 announced that interior secretary @entity133 and homeland security secretary @entity134 will lead a bipartisan @entity136 delegation to inspect the @entity72 coastline after globs of thick , heavy oil began washing into some of the state 's marshlands this week			0
the delegation will meet with federal officials and @entity61 representatives to discuss the ongoing response efforts			2
@entity0 's @entity146 contributed to this report .			0

@entity3 gov. @entity60 wants @entity61 to pay $ 35 million for tourism ads
@entity61 says it will continue using @entity95 dispersant to clean up @entity17 spill
