it 's long been known that dogs and cats , with their highly developed sense of smell , can be trained to identify the volatile chemicals released by human illnesses			1
in some cases , researchers have even trained household pets to detect cancer or predict epileptic seizures			1
but what if we could fine tune that sense and put it into a microchip , allowing us to create a breathalyzer for diseases ? for dr. @entity19 , the inventor of the microchip spectrometer technology at the heart of this " digital nose " , the technology that will allow us to do just that is already here			1
" we can detect down to parts per billion levels , " @entity19 says			1
" to give you an analogy that 's equivalent to one drop in an @entity32 size swimming pool			1
" the sensor , which is no bigger than a dime , works by creating a spectrum of what chemicals are in the air			1
it then identifies each chemical 's unique make - up			2
if the sensor is set and calibrated to a certain level , it will trigger an alarm			0
work continues to shrink it even further in a bid to enter the healthcare market			1
within several years , the company hopes to develop it as a diagnostic tool			2
" what 's amazing is that there really are compounds on your breath that indicate illness , that 's been shown through a number of studies and we can detect those , " he said			2
" there have already been a number of research papers published suggesting we can detect cancer , detect tuberculosis , detect asthma			2
" initially , the technology had been developed for defense purposes			0
he said the threat posed by the events of september 11 had got him thinking about the security applications of this type of sensor			0
" originally it was aimed at detecting things like explosives , toxic chemicals and other threats that might occur , " dr @entity19 told @entity0			0
developed at a research lab at the @entity86 in the @entity87 and now in commercial production at a company called @entity90 with close links to the university , dr @entity19 says the sensor is already in use by oil industry giants like @entity96 and @entity97 and in the food industry by @entity99 and @entity100			0
eventually the sensor could become a part of many everyday appliances , alerting consumers to which foods are going bad in the fridge or even the optimum moment to take the roast out of the oven			0
you could even , one day , have a digital nose that you could carry in your hip pocket			1
" more recently we 've been looking at consumer spaces so we 're talking to a number of manufacturers of mobile phones and mobile phone components , " he said			0
" we want to develop a module small enough to put into mobile devices like phones			0

researches know that dogs and cats can sometimes detect diseases with their keen sense of smell
@entity132 has created a microchip that can detect chemical *molecules* in the air with great *accuracy*
eventually the company wants to enter the healthcare space with a breathalyzer that could detect diseases
its ' digital nose ' can already detect down to parts per billion , equivalent to one drop in an @entity32 swimming pool
