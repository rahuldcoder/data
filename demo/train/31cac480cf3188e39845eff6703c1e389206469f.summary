@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 , a half - submerged carcass of a cruise liner , still sits in the harbor where it ran aground			1
it looks out of place amid the calm blue waters , which belie the chaos of a year ago			1
one year ago sunday , the luxury liner struck rocks and turned on its side off the @entity16 island of @entity0 , killing 32 people			1
several hundred survivors of that wreck and residents plan to commemorate the disaster by holding a @entity22 and observing a minute of silence			1
also , at 9:45 p.m. local time , the moment of impact , they will light and release 32 lanterns -- one for each of the victims			2
about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members were on board the ship that night			2
many were attending a magic show and some thought , when the lights first went out , that the sudden darkness was part of the performance			0
according to passengers ' accounts , chaos erupted as guests rushed to fill the lifeboats and escape the ship			2
some crew members helped passengers and then jumped overboard ; remaining members seemed helpless to handle the melee			2
the @entity52 's captain , @entity52 , could face charges that include manslaughter and abandoning ship			0

meanwhile , the liner is still sitting in the water			0
more than 420 people are working 24 - 7 to secure it , but salvage efforts are taking longer than expected			1
officials now hope to have the ship upright by late june or early july and to tow it to some port by september			0
that represents a delay by a few months			0
" we are working round the clock to get the job done as fast as we can , " said @entity78 , head of salvage operations			1

the @entity3 can not stay in its current position , as it represents a danger for the environment , said @entity102			1
