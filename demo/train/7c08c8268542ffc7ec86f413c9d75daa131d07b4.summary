-- how do living organisms become conscious of what is happening to them and around them ? how is it that i as well as you , reader of these words , can be conscious of our respective existences and of what is going on in our minds — in my case , ideas about how the brain generates consciousness , about the fact that i was asked to prepare this particular text for a specific deadline , along with the fact that i happen to be in @entity22 , at the moment , not @entity24 , and that i am writing this on a cold january day			1
the biological mechanisms behind the phenomena of consciousness remain unclear although it is fair to say that recently our understanding has made remarkable progress			1
what are we are certain of understanding and where is it that our understanding fails ? on the side of understanding , we can point to the process of sensory representation as an important part of consciousness			1
most of what we are conscious of ( conceivably all that we are conscious of ) consists of representations of objects and events in the sensory modalities in which our brains trade , for example , vision , hearing , touching , smelling , taste , sensing the state of our body 's interior			1
mapping , in other words			2
our brains , at all the levels of their organization , are inveterate makers of maps , simple and not so simple , and as far as i can gather , we only become conscious of the things and actions that the sensory systems help us map			1
we depend , for the business of consciousness , on constructing maps of the most varied features and events			1
we construct those maps in brain regions that serve as platforms for this natural process of cartography			1
these are regions where signals about topographic and topological relationships among components of objects and actions can be broken down and assembled in a manner that corresponds to the way in which they happen in the objects and actions themselves			0
but while mapped representations are a necessity for consciousness , as far as i can imagine , they are not sufficient for consciousness to occur			2
for example , several orders of computers aboard a @entity95 represent with great fidelity many parts of the airplane body — moving parts of the wings , undercarriage , rudder — not to mention outside temperature , wind speeds , levels of fuel , and so forth			0
and yet we do not expect even the most integrated computer among the 747 's computer family to be " conscious " of what goes on in the plane , except in a metaphorical sense			1
that top computer knows a lot about the plane 's behavior but it does not " know , " in the sense that the reader and i know , at this very moment , that we are alive and puzzling over the mysteries of consciousness			1
what is different about us ? plenty , i would say			0
beginning at the top of the scale of differences , the 747 lacks a self in the sense that you and i have one			2
i have proposed that selves are built from , but not limited to , myriad , integrated representations of the structure and operations of our bodies , and of the sum total of memories of what has happened to our own body in its history			0
the 747 does not have the equivalent of that part of a self for the very good reason that it does not need one to comply with the demands of its captain			0
there is an even deeper difference , however , that has to do with the issue of feeling			0
an integral part of the notion of self , beginning at the lowest level of self — the primordial self and present all the way up to the autobiographical self — is the fact that we feel the living body to which experiences are happening			0
we feel our body as it lives in the world and wanders in it			0
we experience everything we map through our senses because we feel the body that is the site of all the mappings			0
or to put it more clearly , when we move about or see an object , or hear a voice , we feel the changes that such actions and perceptions caused in our organism			2
i believe to be conscious of our perceptions is to have ongoing representations of streams of events that affect our bodies , cause feelings , and become felt representations			2
representing and feeling are dovetailed phenomena that sit at the rock bottom of experience			0
as we unravel the biological mechanisms behind feeling i suspect we will come to uncover their origins at the level of single neurons			0

@entity203 asks : how do we become conscious of the things around us ?
in a @entity208 , he describes scientific findings about the nature of consciousness
our minds make maps of all the things we see , hear and sense , he says
@entity203 : we need more than the maps ; it takes a sense of self to be fully conscious
