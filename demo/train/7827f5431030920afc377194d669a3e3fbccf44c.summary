it was almost midnight when the surveillance team spotted their target at the base of the cavernous luxury apartment complex			0
he fit the picture on the international arrest warrant which had urgently been issued just weeks previously -- a @entity9 - @entity8 in his early 20s with buzz - cut hair and thick arching eyebrows			1
the agents , who belonged to the @entity14 -- @entity9 's domestic security service , logged the time -- 23.20 on february 11 , 2014 -- and immediately radioed their superiors , who told them to move in to make the arrest			2
when he saw them , the man fled through a gate leading to the staircases , according to @entity9 investigators			2
they gave chase as he clambered up the stairwell to the floors with commanding views over the marina , golf course and @entity32			2
now that he knew they were on to him they could not afford to let him escape			0
the man was wanted because he was suspected of being a member of a terrorist cell that had carried out a grenade attack in @entity39			2
but he had , according to @entity9 authorities , fled to the jihadist battlegrounds of @entity42 for almost a year and a half to escape arrest , and they feared he might be plotting a terrorist attack			1
after learning he was on his way back from @entity42 , they had put his father 's building -- in @entity52 , just up the coast from @entity54 -- under surveillance in case he surfaced there , according to @entity9 security officials			1
their target -- @entity60 , a 23 - year - old @entity9 national born in @entity61 -- had been detected crossing into @entity62 five weeks previously			1
@entity62 border guards had found in his possession a usb stick with instructions for how to make homemade bombs " in the name of @entity69 , " but had not apprehended him , according to investigators			0
investigators did not explain why he was allowed to continue with his journey			0
details on the investigation are emerging at a time of sharply increased concern over the terrorist threat in @entity9 and other @entity78 countries			2
in the wake of @entity83 airstrikes in @entity84 and possible strikes in @entity42 , @entity78 counterterrorism services fear @entity86 or its supporters could retaliate with attacks in @entity78 , a @entity78 counterterrorism official told @entity89			1
following a long trail according to @entity9 security officials , @entity60 had set off for @entity42 in late september 2012 with a childhood friend -- @entity95 , a @entity9 - @entity96 who worked as a cook in grand restaurants on the @entity54 seafront -- just days after @entity92 , an alleged fellow member of their close - knit radical circle , had thrown a grenade into a @entity103 grocery store in @entity104 , a suburb of @entity39 , injuring a shopper			1
@entity60 , one of his friends later told @entity9 investigators , was longing to fight alongside jihadists in @entity42 , and had decided to leave before the dragnet came down , according to officials			1
they left just in time			0
on october 6 , 2012 , @entity92 was killed in a shootout with police in @entity113 after resisting arrest			0
three days later , police recovered bags of potassium nitrate , sulfur , saltpeter , headlight bulbs and a pressure cooker belonging to @entity92 's group in an underground car park in @entity123 , a suburb east of @entity39 , according to prosecutors			0
investigators say they later ascertained their targets were likely @entity103 organizations			0
@entity9 officials called the " @entity123 " group the most dangerous terrorist cell uncovered in the country since the 1995 bombing of the @entity39 metro			2
a dozen men allegedly belonging to the group were arrested and placed under formal investigation on suspicion of alleged terrorism offenses in the weeks following the attack			0
@entity60 and @entity95 , who had shaved off his beard , traveled through @entity141 , crossing the @entity42 border near the @entity141 town of @entity144 , according to investigators			1
according to @entity9 officials , they first joined the @entity42 @entity148 affiliate @entity147 and then are suspected of joining the @entity149 in @entity84 and @entity42 ( @entity86 ) , which now refers to itself as the @entity149			1
@entity9 security services believed they had allegedly linked up with jihadists after wiretapping @entity60 's cell phone			1
by early 2013 they had obtained his @entity42 number by obtaining a warrant to listen to his parents ' phones , according to investigators			2
@entity14 listened in as @entity60 made several calls back to his circle in @entity9 : if any others planned on traveling to @entity42 , they wanted to know about it , according to officials			1
they were also worried the duo could pose a threat if they returned home , according to security officials			1
while they were in @entity42 , the two discussed the need to " punish " @entity9 on social media , according to officials			1
their initial aim had been to die for the cause of holy war in @entity42 , a close member of their circle told investigators			2
soon after @entity60 and @entity95 fled @entity9 , police had discovered their last wills and testaments in the car of a friend , according to officials			1
" i really hope to find you in paradise , where you will be my queen , " @entity60 had written to his wife in a handwritten will , according to investigators			2
according to officials , the same friend revealed during a series of interrogations with @entity14 agents in october 2012 that @entity60 and @entity95 had been determined to fight in @entity42 ever since returning in early 2012 from a several - month - long trip to @entity193 , where they had attended @entity196 classes			1
@entity60 now regarded it as his @entity196 duty , the friend told the @entity14			2
the friend claimed their time overseas had radicalized them			0
the friend described @entity60 as a dominant figure in a small group of like - minded radicals who hung out together after prayers in mosques in the @entity54 area			1
these drew congregants from tougher immigrant neighborhoods just miles from the glitz of the @entity215			2
to kick back , the group visited a nearby river			0
the beach was not an option because of the bikini - clad women			0
the friend said @entity60 tried to persuade him to travel with him to @entity42 , describing the paradise that would await them in the afterlife if they became martyrs and showing him videos of massacres carried out by the @entity230 regime			1
while the friend decided not to travel , he said another member of the circle joined them in @entity42			1
the friend told the @entity14 that @entity60 was supportive of a string of fatal terrorist shootings carried out by the @entity9 - @entity8 extremist @entity239 on @entity9 soldiers and @entity103 schoolchildren in southern @entity9 in march 2012 , according to investigators			1
" @entity60 said if he could not do jihad on @entity196 soil he would do it in @entity9			1
@entity60 compared @entity9 to the head of the serpent , which you had to cut off , " the friend told @entity14 interrogators , according to sources			1
" @entity60 spoke to me often about this @entity253 area in @entity54 and that if he could not go do jihad overseas it would for him be a target			0
" when @entity83 leave for jihad the net closes in on january 16 , 2014 , 13 days after @entity60 was detected reentering @entity78 at the @entity62 border , @entity95 was arrested at the @entity261 port of @entity262 during an identity check and transferred to @entity9 custody , according to officials			1
he also had been making his way back from @entity42 , according to investigators			0
@entity9 security services feared the duo might have plans to launch an attack when they returned to @entity9 , according to counterterrorism officials , but had no idea what , if anything , was planned			1
@entity60 first went to ground in @entity278 , where he was put under surveillance , according to officials , before being traced to @entity52 and his father 's apartment complex			0
as the clock ticked down to midnight on february 11 , @entity14 agents , in hot pursuit up the staircase , eventually caught up with @entity60 between the 11th and 12th floors , and took him into custody			0
@entity60 was placed under formal investigation on suspicion of participation in a criminal conspiracy to prepare acts of terrorism			0
@entity95 is also under formal investigation on the same count			0
both men deny the allegations against them			0
their lawyers were unwilling to comment on the record to @entity89			0
@entity89 contacted the prosecutor 's office for comment on the case but received no reply			0
from @entity83 kid to jihadi to @entity42 six days after @entity60 was taken into custody , police made a startling discovery			1
in a storage closet for technical equipment on the 13th and top floor they found a handgun , bomb - making instructions , and three soda cans filled with the high - explosive compound @entity317			0
screws and nails were attached to one with sticky tape as shrapnel , according to sources briefed on the investigation			0
@entity9 investigators maintain the items belonged to @entity60			2
@entity9 authorities suspect that in the 15 months @entity60 spent in @entity42 , he learned how to make @entity317 , an unstable and difficult - to - transport explosive used to build detonators in multiple @entity148 plots against the @entity330 , according to sources briefed on the investigation			1
recovered from the cans were 950 grams of @entity317 , enough to cause significant destruction			0
it is not clear whether @entity86 signed off on his alleged plot			0
one possibility is that @entity60 was allegedly acting on his own steam , having obtained the training he needed in @entity42 , given his alleged longstanding interest in launching attacks in @entity9			1
more than 800 @entity9 nationals have joined up with jihadist groups in @entity42 , according to officials			1
one former @entity9 isis recruit -- @entity344 -- allegedly shot and killed four people at a @entity103 museum in @entity347 in may , the first terrorist attack on @entity78 soil linked to the conflict in @entity42			2
@entity344 was arrested in @entity9 and extradited to face trial in @entity352			2
he has denied the charges			0
with hundreds of jihadist veterans of @entity42 and @entity84 already back on @entity78 soil , the fear is that the @entity347 attack will not be the last			0
does @entity358 have a jihadi problem ?			0

@entity60 , a @entity9 national from @entity8 , was arrested earlier this year on the @entity215
he and a @entity9 - @entity96 friend are suspected of having joined up with @entity86 in @entity42

authorities were worried the duo could pose a threat if they returned to @entity9
