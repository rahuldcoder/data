@entity1 transportation safety investigators arrived on thursday in @entity2 to try and help determine why a civilian operated @entity5 cargo jet crashed on takeoff from @entity7 , killing all seven crew aboard			1
senior aviation investigator @entity9 is leading a team from the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) that is working with the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) and @entity5 , which made the jumbo jet that crashed on monday			0
the safety board is an independent government agency that investigates transportation accidents in the @entity1 and often assists foreign governments in major cases , especially in air crashes involving a plane made by an @entity1 manufacturer			1
@entity2 's transportation ministry is leading the probe , the safety board said in a statement			1
a priority for crash investigators is to recover the jet 's " black boxes , " the flight data and cockpit voice recorders that could provide clues to a potential cause			1
the final moments of the doomed plane appear to have been captured by a dashboard camera inside a vehicle that was in the area			2
the approximately three - minute video shows what appears to be the jet starting its climb at 11:20 a.m. local time from the base			1
about 12 seconds into the video , it appears to stall , rolls from side to side , and drops			1
at 23 seconds , the plane crashes nose first into the ground off the side of the road , erupting into a ball of orange flame and black smoke			2
there is no immediate reaction from inside the vehicle			0
after the driver brings the vehicle equipped with the webcam to a halt , at 1:15 in the video , someone says , " oh , f * * * ! " at 1:33 , as the camera shows the vehicle moving once again , a noise can be heard -- possibly from a dog			2
someone says , " all right , come here			0
shh ! shh ! @entity73 ! " the yelping stops ; the vehicle stops			0
at 2:13 in the video , the vehicle approaches the crash site and stops , the camera once again capturing thick black smoke			2
" that 's one dramatic fall out of the sky , " said @entity80 , a pilot , engineer and partner with the @entity84 - based law firm @entity83 , which specializes in litigation stemming from plane crashes			1
" it could have been a rock			0
" he added , " the plane just flat - out stalled			2
there 's absolutely no question about that			2
" he said too much cargo in the rear of the plane is one of several possible causes			1
" it looks to me like the plane pitched up ; the most likely cause would be too much load in the rear , " he said in a telephone interview			2
" the plane dropped below minimum controllable airspeed and started to roll			2
" but , he added , " it 's way too early to tell			2
" @entity110 can not confirm the video 's authenticity			1
it bears the date 2013/02/01 , but date stamps can easily be inaccurate			0

it also operates charter passenger service in the @entity122			0

it said the flight originated at @entity127 , a military base in @entity2 , and was en route to @entity129 , @entity130			1
it had stopped to refuel at @entity7 , landing uneventfully			1
the cargo included five mine - resistant , ambush - protected vehicles being taken out of @entity2 as part of the drawdown of @entity1 forces , said @entity137 of @entity116			1
the vehicles , usually referred to as @entity139 , can weigh from 12 tons to 24 tons , depending on the model , according to a 2011 @entity142 report			0
that would mean a minimum of 60 tons , which is within its specifications , according to @entity5			0
" securing them is absolutely critical to safety , " said @entity146 , former director of the @entity12 's @entity147			1
it 's critical that the total weight be within the limit and that the plane be balanced , he said			1
" when the airplane is rotated with the nose up , the cargo moves aft if it 's not properly secured , " he said			1
@entity116 said the cargo was properly loaded and secured and had passed all necessary inspections prior to departing @entity127			0
no additional cargo was added during the stop in @entity7 and the aircraft 's cargo was again inspected prior to departure			1
the company would not speculate on a possible cause of the crash and said it was cooperating with investigators			0
six of the crash victims were from @entity171 , @entity11 said			0
they were identified as @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177			0
the other victim , @entity178 , was from @entity179			0
