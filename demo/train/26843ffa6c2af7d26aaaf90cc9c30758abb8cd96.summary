a day after the @entity10 ambassador to the @entity7 said that experts in his country are close to identifying the killer , two @entity7 law enforcement officials told @entity15 that counterterrorism experts are still unable to @entity18 's executioner			1
@entity7 analysts said it 's not knowable from the video released by @entity22 who carried out @entity18 's killing , because the entire slaying is not shown			1
a man moves a knife across @entity18 's neck , then the picture fades to black			1
now one forensics expert has raised the issue that there appear to be two militants in the video			1
it 's one of several puzzles , but there are a number of clues as to who committed this horrible act and where			0
accent the focus has been on a man in the video who has a @entity10 accent			1
@entity49 , @entity10 ambassador to the @entity7 , said sunday that @entity10 agents have been using " very sophisticated technologies , voice identification and so on " to identify the suspect			1
" we are very close to identifying who this guy is , " he said			0
@entity57 , an audio expert , told @entity15 it sounded like the way someone in a certain area of @entity62 would talk			2
" the speaker is using a variety of @entity65 known as multicultural @entity62 @entity65 and that 's a kind of melting pot accent that 's emerged in recent years , particularly in deprived , multi-ethnic areas of inner @entity62 , " @entity57 said			1
there is only one voice heard on the audio track			0
stature but @entity72 , a forensics expert who spoke to @entity15 , said there is another man , and he might be the actual killer			1
the second militant appears on the video after an obvious edit			2
" there 's definitely a change of actor , " @entity72 said			0
" there are noticeable , there are subtle but there are also noticeable changes in their build , their physical appearance			0
" the video contains other data like the measurements of a face , even though it is hidden			2
that could help investigators sift through databases of passport photos			2
knives the man who speaks holds a knife in one of his hands			0
it looks to be a different knife than the one that was left next to @entity18 's body			1
the dimensions and style of the knives are slightly different , @entity72 said			0
holster when trying to determine whether the @entity10 - accented man is also the killer , it helps to examine where his pistol is holstered			1
it is underneath his left armpit -- that is for use by his right hand			2
but the executioner appears on the video to be left - handed			1
it 's unclear why this happened			0
location blogger @entity123 looked at the background of the video			2
behind the men is a road going over the hilly terrain			0
on the right side of the frame is a dip in the hills , one @entity123 matched to a break he found in an image on @entity136			0
there was another camera angle used in the video and in the distance there is a field and some buildings			0
he believes the clues show the video was recorded south of the town of @entity148 in north central @entity2 .			0

one forensics expert says there are definitely two militants in video
the one who spoke with a @entity10 accent may not have been the executioner
speaker has a holster *suitable* for a right - handed person , but apparent killer used his left
a blogger thinks he has used *satellite* photos to figure out where @entity18 was killed
