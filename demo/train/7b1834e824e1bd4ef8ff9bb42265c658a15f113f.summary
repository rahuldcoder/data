@entity0 -- @entity2 addressed a number of crime and justice issues during a sweeping talk with @entity1 on wednesday , including taking on the @entity7 and its pro-gun policy			1
the former president , in a conversation with @entity1 's @entity11 at the @entity13 meeting in @entity0 , lumped together the @entity7 , stand your ground laws , and people surrounding themselves only with those who agree with them as problems that lead to a more violent climate in the @entity20			1
@entity23 's @entity22 airstrikes get @entity2 's approval @entity2 , however , rejected the idea that several high - profile cases with apparent racial undertones mean the @entity20 is more racist than it was in the past			1
" i think we have enhanced the risks by changing the environment , basically , because it seems we bought the @entity7 's theory that we would all be safer if everybody in this audience had a gun that was a concealed weapon , " @entity2 said			1
" then if one of them felt threatened by another , they could stand up right here and stand their ground			1
and we could watch the whole saga unfold			0
" @entity7 focuses on three major @entity47 races during the 2013 trial of @entity49 , who shot and killed 17 - year - old @entity50 in @entity51 , the @entity7 stridently advocated to maintain stand your ground laws that allow people to respond with force to would - be attackers			1
a jury acquitted @entity49 of second - degree murder and manslaughter charges in @entity50 's death in 2013			0
the case captured the nation 's attention and raised a number of question about race			0
the @entity49 trial was n't the only case involving race that @entity2 addressed on wednesday			2
@entity2 pointed out that the more recent shooting of an unarmed teen in @entity71 , @entity72 , ignited similar concerns about race and the law			2
overnight on wednesday the city broke into protests again over the shooting of 18 - year - old @entity79 by officer @entity80			0
@entity80 has not been arrested , but a grand jury in @entity72 has taken the @entity79 case			0
after weeks of calm , @entity71 erupts again over burned memorial @entity2 said one of the primary problems in @entity71 was that the city 's police force and political leadership did not reflect the population			1
" you ca n't have a community that is more than two - thirds @entity93 where only one in six city council people are african - american and only three out of 60 - plus police are @entity93 , " @entity2 said			1
" you 've got to have some effort to have ties to the community			0
" although @entity2 said that while cases like @entity49 and @entity71 do not mean the country is becoming more racist , he did express concern that the country is " playing with [ racism 's ] darker possibilities			1
" " i actually think we 're less racist , less sexist , less homophobic than we used to be , " @entity2 said			2
" i think our big problem today is we do n't want to be around anybody who disagrees with us			0
and i think that in some ways can be the worst silo of all to be held up in			0
" the former president later added , " i think whenever people are insecure , they tend to return to home base psychologically			2
we tend to want to be with our own , however we define that			0
... i think that 's what is really at the root of many of our problems today			0
