-- talk shows have proliferated in @entity2 since the beginning of the january 25 revolution nearly two years ago			1
one host has become particularly famous , to the point of being described as the " @entity7 of the @entity9 world			0
" @entity10 was even a guest on " @entity11 " itself in june , and recently @entity0 anchor @entity13 interviewed him about freedom of speech in @entity2			1
in the aftermath of the passing of @entity2 's new constitution , it seems @entity10 himself may become an example of the ultimate test of that very freedom			1
since @entity10 -- a 38 - year - old heart surgeon -- hit the airwaves in 2011 , he 's received a great deal of criticism for his satirical style , expressed in a quintessentially @entity2 idiom and flair			1
no one , it seems , escapes his sharp tongue -- if they are in the political arena or have affected public discourse , then they 're fair game			0
the more significant their influence and impact , the more they can expect to be lampooned on @entity10 's weekly program -- called , simply , " @entity43			2
" all the famous members of the political opposition today , such as the @entity46 , as well as all the major candidates in this year 's historic presidential election , have been the subject of spoof on " @entity43			0
" the show 's latest season began a few weeks ago , and , as expected , the country 's new president , @entity53 , as well as his " renaissance " project to improve @entity2 , was critiqued and scoffed at for political failings			1
news : @entity53 praises voters as constitution becomes law while @entity7 may be unpopular in certain sections of @entity65 , it 's hard to imagine him being sued or censured for his scathing wit			0
in @entity2 , however , the very day after the new constitution was approved in a poorly attended vote on december 22 , a lawyer filed a complaint with the prosecutor general against @entity10 for " insulting " president @entity53 on his show			1
the complaint involves one of @entity10 's recent episodes , when @entity10 affectionately held a pillow imprinted with the president 's picture amid hearts			1
if the prosecutor takes it up , it could become a serious case			0
other threats have come from religious radicals			1
@entity10 is , in his own words , a " proud muslim , " and has made it clear on his show and in interviews that he takes his religion seriously			2
like many @entity2 , he is particularly sensitive to a religious discourse that divides , encourages polarization and incites hatred			2
his show has mocked the sectarian and heterodox preachers and journalists who promote such sentiments			0
in response , many of those same figures have viciously attacked @entity10 's program , claiming that it is " religiously impermissible			2
" the public , however , seems uninterested in such politicization of religion , and more mainstream religious figures , such as @entity108 of the @entity109 , declared that the abuse of religion in the discourse @entity10 was criticizing was a real problem			2
opinion : @entity115 will muddle through 2013 but @entity10 's program is not really the point			0
rather , it is a test case			0
the reaction to his show touches upon two key issues for post-revolution @entity2 : freedom of expression , particularly with figures in authority , and the reaction of @entity2 society toward the abuse of religion for sectarian , political gain			0
the protests that led to former @entity2 president @entity132 's downfall were indelibly linked to breaking the curtain of fear that surrounded any criticism of a political figure			1
@entity2 society is unlikely to favor going back to that kind of public atmosphere			0
while the overwhelming majority of @entity2 are not given or sympathetic to sectarian or radical ideas , many were unaware -- or ignored -- that there is a potent minority that supports such notions			0
how @entity2 now respond in terms of both issues will affect not only @entity10 's television program , but how @entity2 itself will develop in the months and years to come			1
incidentally , with true @entity2 humor , @entity10 responded to the news of the legal complaint against him in a way that shows he still intends to carry on : he asked @entity53 to autograph the pillow in question			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity157 .			0

@entity10 , a heart surgeon , is a satirical sensation on @entity2 tv
his show *mercilessly* mocks politicians and religious radicals , says @entity157
a legal complaint has been filed against him for insulting @entity2 's president on the show
if the case proceeds , there could be free - speech *repercussions* , says @entity157
