-- @entity1 has finally asked for a bank bailout from its eurozone peers , to weather the financial crisis that hampered its finances during recent months			2
although @entity1 's prime minister , @entity8 , has stressed that there are no austerity conditions attached to it , the statement from the @entity7 made clear that supervision over the country 's budget will be strengthened			1
the budget deficit aims may mean the @entity1 government will implement further structural reforms , such as a reducing the country 's unemployment benefits , or raising the retirement age			1
as a result , we may see public disaffection shifting from the streets to the political arena			2
unlike other countries -- such as @entity27 , for example -- in @entity1 public disaffection with the economic crisis has not yet had a significant impact on the country 's traditional political forces			1
instead , @entity1 citizens have mainly channeled their anger and frustration over austerity measures through social mobilization , while the political landscape has remained virtually the same			1
although there has been shift in power -- the @entity43 ( @entity44 ) took over after general elections in november 2011 -- the political arena continues to be dominated by the two largest parties , @entity44 and the @entity48 , @entity49			2
the striking aspect of the emergence of the @entity1 indignados movement was that it came about in a country which has , traditionally , had low levels of civic engagement and social participation			1
while the indignados have been discredited by the right - wing mass media as being a marginal force mainly followed by @entity62 ( @entity1 slang to describe wandering minstrels ) , the movement -- which had its anniversary on may 15 -- has shown no signs of fading away			2
indeed , a majority of @entity1 citizens sympathize with its aims and support its goals			1
recent studies show the indignados are not just a movement of the young and marginalized			0
many participants are middle - aged , highly - educated and employed , and a majority of them consider their current financial situation relatively good			0
at the same time , many share a concern about their future financial situation			0
for a short period the indignados managed to get a reform of the electoral system , that would improve the chances of small parties to be represented in parliament , on the policy agenda			0
but they have not yet achieved any significant policy goal			0
now , some proposals to improve democracy and control corruption have been pushed aside as focus turns instead to the deteriorating economic situation			0
the movement 's current demands focus on the unbalanced distribution of economic costs due to the austerity measures			1
this does not mean that the indignados have failed , as their most important success indicator is the activation of the protest " muscle " in @entity1 society , particularly among the network of social organizations at the local level			2
but if the bank rescue results in further reductions of social welfare funds , or if it is a prelude to the bailout of the state , the government risks unleashing social protest in a way existing social movements may not be able to channel			0
public discontent may then shift from the streets to the political stage			1
this could ruin the leverage of the traditional political forces and , in turn , the capacity of the political system to manage the economic crisis			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity130 .			0

@entity130 : @entity1 's political landscape has been relatively calm despite the austerity measures
but the @entity1 indignados movement have *gathered* support in a country with low civic engagement
@entity130 says a majority of citizens sympathize with the aims of the indignados
public discontent may shift from the streets to the political stage should this bailout not be enough
