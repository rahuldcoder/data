-- educators and policymakers have long dreamed of providing universal , low cost , first - class higher education			1
their wish may come true soon thanks to an unlikely source : @entity8			1
the mecca of the technology universe is in the process of revolutionizing higher education in a way that educators , colleges and universities can not , or will not			1
one of the men responsible for what may be an @entity20 - like renaissance is @entity21 , @entity22 's vice president and pioneer in artificial intelligence and robotics			1
known in science circles for his engineering feats -- like @entity28 , the self - driving car -- @entity21 is using his technological prowess to make quality higher education available to the world			1
i recently interviewed him on my radio show , " @entity36			0
" last year , while teaching a graduate level artificial intelligence class at @entity39 , @entity21 lamented that his course could only reach 200 students in the suburbs of @entity43			1
so , he decided to offer his own free online class , with the same homework , quizzes and tests that he gives to @entity39 students			0
he announced the proposal with a single e-mail			0
before he knew it , he had a flood of takers			0
" usually i reach about 200 students and now i reach 160,000 , " said @entity21 incredulously			1
" in my entire life of education i did n't have as much an impact on people as i had in these two months			0
" by utilizing online videos and educational resources , @entity21 's class was being accessed by students from all corners of the world			1
in fact , the students themselves translated the class for free from @entity69 into 44 languages			0
until now , an overwhelming number of these students -- many in developing countries and lacking standard education credentials -- never would have had a chance at a @entity39 - level education			1
yet , their appetite for quality education was strong			0
do we need a revolution in higher education ? in fact , of all the students taking @entity21 's class globally and at @entity39 , the top 410 students were online			1
the 411th top performer was a @entity39 student			0
" we just found over 400 people in the world who outperformed the top @entity39 student , " @entity21 said			1
realizing the potential at his fingertips , @entity21 launched @entity92 , an independent online education company that provides high quality education at low cost to virtually everyone			1
@entity92 offers 11 stem courses like " introduction to @entity98 , " " @entity99 to @entity100 , " and " @entity101 " -- all free			1
there are no admissions offices and anyone can sign up			0
after the class , students can choose to certify their skills online or in one of @entity92 's 4,500 testing centers for a fee			1
those certificates can then be sent to employers			0
in one course you can learn to make your own @entity22 - style search engine in just seven weeks			1
the reaction has been overwhelming			0
" people really want good education			0
there is a huge need , " @entity21 said			2
" hundreds of thousands of people just sign up because they really care			0
they really want to advance themselves and their lives and they do n't want to pay $ 50,000 or $ 100,000 to get there			0
" the classes are structured much like university classes			0
but instead of traditional types of lectures , all - star professors give video presentations that directly engage and challenge students			2
@entity21 is using technology not only to transform educational access and curriculums , but also teaching			2
for the past thousand years , professors have been lecturing at students			0
" [ it 's ] like trying to lose weight by watching a professor exercise , " quips @entity21			1
now he is leading a new charge -- interactive , student focused technology education			0
on my radio show alone early one morning , several listeners called in to say they already took classes through @entity92			2
one man had his sights set on graduate school but was too busy with family and work to ever finish along a traditional path			0
now , through @entity92 , he can take the @entity160 classes he wants when he wants			2
another man , age 53 , decided to change careers and go back to a local college to study computer science			0
when he heard of @entity92 , he dropped out of school and signed up for an online course			2
he said he learned more in several weeks with @entity92 than he did in an entire semester at the local college , and he paid nothing for it			2
as you can imagine , @entity21 's enterprise has rattled the foundations of the education establishment			1
his critics say that a @entity92 certificate is worth nothing and how can one know the true identity of a student on the free - for - all jungle that is the internet ? i raised these questions to @entity21			1
he said @entity92 has already partnered with more than 20 companies who verify and accept the certificates of course completion			2
some are already hiring graduates of @entity92 courses			2
@entity21 is also working with other companies to design and tailor classes to specific needs in the work force			2
soon , @entity92 will be launching in - person testing centers to verify a student 's knowledge and skills			1
@entity92 is simultaneously meeting the educational needs of the public and the vocational requirements of the labor force directly and efficiently , more so than we can say of many universities and colleges			2
i asked @entity21 whether his enterprise and others like it will be the end of higher education as we know it -- exclusive enclaves for a limited number of students at high tuitions ? " i think it 's the beginning of higher education , " @entity21 replied			1
" it 's the beginning of higher education for everybody			1
" read more about education on schools of thought much of traditional @entity223 higher education prides itself on a false promotion of diversity , opportunity and excellence			1
but to my knowledge , with one class alone , @entity21 has provided a level of diversity , opportunity and academic rigor not seen before			1
people from any country , any background and any income level can receive an elite education at virtually no cost			0
we have been talking about equal educational opportunity for years			0
what is going on here may be its true advent			0
what 's wrong with @entity223 's school system ? share your thoughts , photos and videos with us on @entity252			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity255 .			0

@entity257 : we have dreamed of providing universal , low cost , first - class higher education
@entity255 : thanks to @entity8 , and @entity21 , we may soon attain that dream
he says @entity21 's @entity92 is an inspiring model for the *future* of education
@entity255 : traditional higher education has much to learn from @entity21 's enterprise
