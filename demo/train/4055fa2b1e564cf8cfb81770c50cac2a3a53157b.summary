" tuesday 's muted atmosphere was a prelude to wednesday 's @entity61 hearing on the @entity7 attack			1
panel chairman @entity63 has released testimony from three whistle blowers who plan to discuss what they feel were security failures at the compound during the attack			2
the testimony of @entity73 , a former top @entity6 diplomat in @entity8 , has been the focus of @entity63 's hearing			1

democrats on the @entity78 charge the hearing is a charade			2
the committee 's senior @entity81 , @entity84 rep. @entity83 , said members of @entity86 have an obligation to actually investigate claims before coming to conclusions and making public accusations			1

despite being nine months removed from the terrorist attack , the tragedy has maintained a steady drumbeat on @entity95 , particularly with @entity11 , who claim to not yet know the full story of what transpired			2

@entity29 said she would take responsibility for personnel security if confirmed as ambassador			1
" on security -- and again this is something that is , well , as we know it is deadly serious for us , " she said			0
" it is the role of the ambassador -- the ambassador is the principal security officer at post			2
and it is the ambassador who has to decide whether to allow people to travel here or there , whether to ask for additional assets , whether to insist on additional assets			0

@entity29 is a respected career diplomat who has held consulate and embassy posts in @entity149 , the @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154			1
most recently , she served as @entity6 ambassador to @entity156 from 2008 to 2011			2
there has been a great deal of tension between @entity160 and @entity11 on @entity7 , partly stemming from televised comments after the attack by @entity164 ambassador @entity163 , who said it was a spontaneous act that grew out of a demonstration over an anti-islam film made in the @entity6			2
later , the administration called the @entity7 matter a terror attack			0
@entity171 and other officials said that her comments explaining the incident publicly relied on official talking points			0
still , the initial statements and the resulting controversy cost her a likely nomination to succeed @entity181 as secretary of state			0
certain @entity11 members also sharply questioned @entity184 over the administration 's explanation of events and the state of security at the compound prior to the attack			2
@entity184 said she took responsibility for the deaths , stating that as secretary of state , she was " in charge of the @entity198 's 60,000 - plus people all over the world			0
" in january 2013 , @entity184 testified for more than five hours before the @entity61 and @entity18 committees			1
in her testimony , she acknowledged a " systematic breakdown " on @entity7 and said her department was taking additional steps to increase @entity6 security at diplomatic posts			0
critics have questioned the validity of continued congressional scrutiny , especially @entity160 who say @entity11 are only interested in discrediting the administration and hurting @entity184 's chances of running for president in 2016 .			0
