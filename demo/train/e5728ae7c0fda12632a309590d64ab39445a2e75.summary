-- @entity1 is like many other college students			2
when he has a big test coming up , he turns to what 's called a " study drug " for a little extra boost			2
" i 'm more driven			1
i do n't focus on anything else , " the @entity8 senior says about taking the drugs			1
" if i have a paper , that 's all i 'm doing			2
no distractions , no socializing , just on with it			0
" @entity1 takes the prescription drug @entity17 , designed to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , or @entity19			1
he does n't have adhd or a prescription , but the drug is not hard for him to get			1
" it 's easy -- not sketchy or perceived in a bad way , " he says			0
" maybe a simple text or a phone call			0
' hey mind if i get some @entity17 ? i 've got a long night ahead of me			1
' " after taking the pill he hits the books in his fraternity house room , pulling an all - nighter studying			0
it 's a scene that is playing out at college campuses across the @entity34			0
@entity35 , a professor and researcher at the @entity37 , has tracked study drug use there			2
" it 's abused more than marijuana and easier to get , " he says			0
@entity35 ' research found that 30 % of students at the university have illegally used a stimulant , like the @entity19 drugs @entity17 or @entity47			1
the numbers increase with upperclassmen			0
half of all juniors and seniors have used the drugs , the study found , and 80 % of upperclassmen in fraternities and sororities have taken them			1
@entity17 is an amphetamine and can be habit forming			1
the federal government lists it as a schedule ii drug			0
drugs in that category have , according to @entity34 law " the highest abuse potential and dependence profile of all drugs that have medical utility			2
" dr. @entity70 , an assistant professor in the @entity71 at @entity73 's school of medicine in @entity75 , says he worries about students who might take these drugs			1
" they might produce euphoria , they might temporarily make it easier ... but in the long run there are significant problems both in terms of thinking , mood problems , maybe even functionality			1
" @entity70 , who also is the medical director at the @entity89 mental health treatment facility in @entity75 , says drugs like @entity17 can produce jitters , headaches , stomach problems or even eventually lead to psychosis , a mental disorder that includes the loss of contact with reality			1
additionally , he worries about pressure on students to be perfect , saying , " if you 're a student and you feel you are not good enough to be able to do things without the aid of external help , that 's an idea that gets reinforced that can lead to a whole bunch of different problems			1
" students apparently do n't see it that way			1
another telling statistic from @entity35 ' research at the @entity37 is how dangerous the students think these cognitive enhancing stimulants are			2
they say they see @entity17 as slightly more dangerous than the soft drink @entity119 and nowhere near as dangerous as drinking beer and smoking			1
taking drugs without a prescription or buying the controlled substances is illegal and students who use the drugs could face prosecution			1
but for students like @entity1 , use of study drugs is so common they do n't see it as a problem			1
" i would see how the law is there , " he says			0
" i consider it kind of an unwritten rule			0
... it 's ok if you 're just getting it for one thing			0
if you 're consistently using it and not prescribed that 's crossing the line			0
" some scientists say cognitive enhancement drugs should be carefully legalized and made available for this kind of use			2
in the journal nature in 2008 , a commentary by five researchers said , " we should welcome new methods of improving our brain function			0
" they added , " safe and effective cognitive enhancers will benefit both the individual and society			0
" @entity1 says the drug works for him			0
