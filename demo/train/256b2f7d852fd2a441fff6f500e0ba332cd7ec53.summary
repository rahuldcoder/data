so , what 's the revamp 's dealio ? the brand touts on its new website that " we have been busy creating a new empire			0
are you ready to join us on our new adventure ? ' judge none , @entity22 '			0
" though the brand has been active on @entity24 and @entity25 since october , the wide - leg reboot gained @entity27 traction this week after appearing at a fashion trade event in @entity29			1
" through the use of experimental fits , cutting - edge techniques and application of fresh , unconventional fabrications , @entity11 sets to defy the rules of street wear and re-establish a brand and aesthetic that is purely in a class of its own , " according to its website			2
sneak peeks of the upcoming collection hint that it 's more streetwear - focused , with flat - bill caps , graphic tees and grungy plaids , but @entity47 is buzzing for any and all impending @entity48 as the brand hints at a " heritage " collection with jeans with 20 - inch - plus leg openings			2
