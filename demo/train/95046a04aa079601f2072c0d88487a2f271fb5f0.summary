-- @entity2 's maps team has made fantastic advances in surveying and mapping seemingly every square inch of navigable ground on the planet			1
but for mobile users , those maps have always stopped just short of indoor spaces -- until now			2
@entity12 6.0 for @entity13 launched tuesday with a bold initiative : indoor mapping			1
partnering at launch with a selection of businesses and public service structures , the new mobile maps version allows users to see the entire layout of a mapped building , switch between floor plans if the structure has multiple levels , and locate indoor points of interest like retail stores , bathrooms and atms			1
obviously , indoor mapping is only useful when the building you 're navigating is big enough to warrant it			2
to this end , @entity2 has partnered with more than 25 major businesses that handle large crowds on a regular basis -- major travel sites like @entity42 and @entity45 's @entity44 airports , as well as giant retailers like @entity47 and @entity48 's			1
considering the layers of thick concrete and steel holding up some of these buildings , it 's been difficult for @entity2 to get its location - aware technology up to snuff			0
" gps is unreliable and does n't work well indoors , " said @entity12 project manager @entity56 in an interview			0
" we used similar information to how we 've implemented the navigation ' blue dot ' feature in the past , and we 've been able to improve the accuracy indoors , at an accuracy of about 5 to 10 meters			0
" while half of the initiative begins in @entity69 structures , @entity2 is simultaneously launching in @entity70 , covering @entity72 's massive underground subway network and retail shopping centers ( an area where new visitors definitely need a map )			0
while version 6.0 is n't covering @entity69 transit , @entity56 says the @entity70 transit coverage " can give us a sense for what 's in store for the future			0
" while it 's just a beginning , @entity2 has also launched a beta tool that allows businesses to upload their own floor plans to the @entity12 database			1
slowly but surely , @entity2 hopes to entice more businesses and major indoor areas of interest -- both small and large -- to opt in for indoor mapping			1
of course , these are private spaces , not freely accessible public roads , so it 's an initiative for the long haul			0
the update is currently available in the @entity98 for phones and tablets running @entity13 version 2.1 and up			2
