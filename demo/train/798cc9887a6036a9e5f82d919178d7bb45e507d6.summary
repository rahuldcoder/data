-- the @entity1 -- in partnership with its ally @entity4 -- spied during a pair of major 2010 summits of world leaders in @entity8 , @entity9 reported , citing top secret documents obtained from whistleblower @entity11			1
both the @entity13 and @entity14 summits were held in june 2010 in @entity4 's most populated city			1
and both times , @entity1 's @entity16 conducted widespread surveillance that was " closely coordinated with the @entity4 partner , " according to @entity9 's account of a briefing note from the @entity1 spy agency			1
the multi-day spying operation focused at making sure meeting sites were safe , protecting against terrorist threats and " providing support to policymakers , " a @entity16 briefing document states , according to the @entity4 news outlet			1
the @entity16 and the office of director of national intelligence , president @entity33 's top intelligence adviser , did not respond thursday to @entity0 requests for comment on the @entity9 report			1
@entity38 's @entity37 , or @entity37 , did not comment to the @entity9 , according to that news outlet			0
when similar reports have surfaced in the past			0
@entity1 government officials have pointed to the @entity33 - ordered review of @entity1 's intelligence gathering -- which gained steam after reports that @entity47 chancellor @entity46 had been spied on -- but refused to comment on specific claims			2
but they also have not backed away from the idea that the @entity1 spies , just like other nations do			0
" as we have made clear , ... the @entity1 gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations , " said @entity16 spokeswoman @entity52 in october , when the @entity46 reports stirred tensions between traditional allies in @entity47 and the @entity1			1
the new @entity9 reporting does not specify which world leaders , if any , were targeted during the @entity13 and @entity14 summits , or what specific information may have been obtained			1
nor does the @entity4 news outlet 's account of the @entity16 documents spell out what role , if any , the @entity37 had in it			2
if that @entity4 agency had been complicit in snooping on anyone -- be they @entity4 or foreign nationals -- without a warrant , it could violate that @entity74 nation 's laws , the @entity9 reports			1
@entity13 summits are meetings of world leaders from the @entity78 , @entity4 , @entity79 , @entity47 , @entity80 , @entity81 , the @entity82 and the @entity1			1
@entity14 summits incorporate a larger group , traditionally taking place once or twice each year			2
during these meetings , leaders traditionally discuss a wide range of important and sometimes hot - button issues			0
at the end of 2010 's @entity92 in @entity8 , for example , the group issued a final statement focusing on recovery from a global economic crisis while also criticizing @entity96 and @entity97			0
the fact that @entity11 is linked to the @entity9 's report is n't a big surprise			1
the now 30 - year - old worked as an information technology contractor for the @entity1 government			0
he collected information on his native country 's spy programs , then exposed them to media outlets such as the @entity109 and the @entity110			0
some of the reported leaks -- like that the @entity16 mined phone and internet metadata from thousands of people inside and outside of the @entity1 -- put the @entity33 administration on the defensive , trying to justify its spying programs while assuring @entity1 of their privacy			0
others , like the claims that @entity46 was spied on for years , forced @entity122 to do damage control with leaders of countries overseas			0
@entity1 authorities have charged @entity11 with espionage and theft of government property			0
but they have n't arrested him : instead , he is in @entity81 , which on august 1 granted him asylum for one year			0
this is n't the first time that documents from @entity11 have been linked to @entity14 spying			2
@entity78 's electronic intelligence agency monitored @entity14 delegates ' phones and tried to capture their passwords during a summit held there in 2009 , the @entity109 newspaper reported , citing documents obtained from @entity11 .			2

@entity9 says it obtained a top secret @entity16 document from @entity11
it says the @entity1 conducted surveillance during the @entity13 , @entity14 summits in @entity8
this was " closely coordinated with the @entity4 partner , " the @entity16 says , reports @entity9
@entity1 agencies have n't responded to comment on this report
