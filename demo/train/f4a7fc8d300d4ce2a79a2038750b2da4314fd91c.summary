-- the world now knows that the remains of @entity3 -- the final @entity5 king of @entity6 who fell at the @entity7 in 1485 -- were under a parking lot			1
by most accounts , the dead monarch 's corpse was unceremoniously carried back to nearby @entity12 and buried at the church of the @entity14 , where it was lost for more than 500 years			2
the odds that archaeologists might recover @entity3 's remains more than a half millennium later were exceptionally slim			1
after dna testing and further analysis , the @entity18 was able to confirm beyond a reasonable doubt that the skeleton indeed was that of @entity3 archaeologists rarely search for individuals , let alone lost monarchs , and the @entity12 excavation was focused on analyzing the medieval friary at which @entity3 was rumored to be buried			1
nevertheless , archaeologists share the popular curiosity about famous personalities and the larger stories their lives and mortal remains might tell			1
if we are excavating missing people from @entity3 's past , then we should start with the remains of the so - called " @entity38 " -- that is , his nephews @entity40 and @entity42			1
@entity3 : is this the face that launched 1,000 myths ? the princes were held in the @entity46 and likely murdered around 1483 at @entity3 's command			1
their rumored remains now rest under @entity49 , and a survey of the remains in 1933 found two youth 's partial skeletons with a random mix of animal bones			2
dna analysis alone is not enough to seal this case , however , and any conclusion would neither incriminate @entity3 nor prove his innocence , so such a study would mostly be a public curiosity			2
@entity63 's plane went down in the @entity64 in 1937 , unleashing decades of curiosity about the fate of @entity63 and her navigator , @entity67			1
@entity63 has long been viewed as a symbol of bravery and feminism , and after intensive but unsuccessful efforts to locate her in 1937 , the @entity71 attempted to find @entity63 in the late 1980s			2
enlisting archaeologist @entity74 , a shoe was recovered in a location with circumstantial evidence of @entity63 's plane , but nothing substantial has turned up			1
an interesting archaeological mystery is the disappearance of the @entity82 colony from contemporary @entity83 in 1587			0
an @entity6 crew left the @entity82 colony that august with plans to return the following year , but by the time the @entity6 returned in 1590 , the settlement was empty			0
the missing colonists might have been wiped out by indigenous neighbors , captured by those neighbors or joined those native communities			0
an archaeological investigation by @entity92 recovered some 16th century material culture , including a ring linked to a colonist			0
but shoreline erosion removed much of the archaeological evidence associated with the colony			0
dna testing has also been conducted with the argument that the colony became part of the neighboring indigenous groups			0
nevertheless , there 's been no satisfying evidence to resolve precisely what happened to the @entity82 colony			0
few historical figures inspire as much curiosity as @entity108 , the military leader and empire builder who unified the disparate groups scattered across present - day @entity111			0
when he died in 1227 , @entity108 was buried in an exceptionally well - concealed , unmarked tomb whose location had become a mystery a century later			2
a 2003 study suggested that nearly 8 % of the men living in the former @entity117 share a genetic lineage that was likely descended from @entity108 and his male relatives			0
eight centuries later , @entity108 's lost tomb would shed light on the ritual practices associated with one of history 's most powerful empires and its best - known leader			1
as we continue to be captivated by the dramatic discovery of @entity3 's remains , we should keep in mind that it 's just one piece of material culture from a complex site that tells a story that will reach well beyond the mere hunt for a monarch 's grave			1
what the excavation reveals about medieval warfare , life among the wealthiest 15th century people and everyday life in a late medieval friary could be even more compelling			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity147 .			0

@entity149 : the odds of discovering @entity3 's remains were exceptionally slim
@entity147 : archaeologists rarely search for individuals , let alone lost monarchs
he says that some personalities fascinate us , including @entity63 , @entity108
@entity147 : big discoveries can give us compelling *glimpses* into past history and culture
