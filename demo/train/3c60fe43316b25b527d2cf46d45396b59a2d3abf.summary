@entity0 -- this just in : male @entity2 exist			0
i know this thanks to a monitor installed in the newsroom that flashes the very latest trending topics on @entity8			0
what 's trending , as i write this sentence ? a few hashtag games like " # @entity15 , " a tribute to former teen queen @entity17 , " @entity11 is our @entity12 , " and " @entity18 , " a reference to obsessive fans of @entity21			0
on my desk i have a multitude of networked devices -- @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28			0
the @entity31 dominates our workspace			1
but it literally owns our life space as well			1
@entity35 -- and that includes me -- spend at least eight hours a day staring at a screen			1
and more than one - third of smartphone users get online before they get out of bed			1
we all know by now that the @entity31 is not just a means of communication			1
it 's a parallel ecosystem , our digital state of nature			0
but how much of our internet - based time is wasted time ? and how much is absolutely integral to our daily lives ? read more posts from @entity49 @entity50 may not have intended the @entity31 to be used this way , but i regularly find myself online to settle nagging pop culture questions			1
when was @entity55 ' first concert appearance ? who wrote " before @entity57 ? " did @entity59 ever guest star in " @entity60 ? " a swift surf of @entity62 or @entity63 and * score * -- i have the answer			0
but then i end up wandering through various hyperlinks and suddenly it 's 3:30 am and i 'm watching back - to - back episodes of the @entity68 in bed			2
i often wonder what blogger @entity70 would do			1
as he 's on a year - long @entity31 fast , @entity70 would have to go to a local library and microfiche his way to pop culture know - how			1
pulling the plug on the internet during his self - imposed internet exile , @entity70 can not browse the @entity77 -- not even over someone 's shoulder			1
he can not access @entity80 or other forms of streaming media			0
nor can he pay bills online or send a text message			0
one month into his fast , i asked him why he decided to give up the net for an entire year			1
" i just wanted some time to myself and do some personal study , " he said			0
" i know i am most productive when i do n't have the internet on			1
i disconnect , i unplug at a coffee shop with no @entity90 to get something done			2
so why not spend a year getting stuff done ? " he describes his first day off the @entity86 as calm and @entity94 - like : " for me , it 's such a relief			1
no one can get hold of me			0
no one can infringe on my time -- text message me , email me or pull me out of my head space			2
" but perhaps the greatest takeaway from talking to @entity70 and reading his regular updates , is knowing that the first generation to come of age on the @entity31 is becoming the first generation to realize that the @entity31 ai n't all that			1
" maybe a generation before me or my parents see the internet as this perfect modern convenience of getting things done			2
but i know a lot of people my age just live on the @entity31 , and it fills all their free time , " he added			1
" the big thing i 'm trying to do is reclaim my free time			2
right now , i 'm bored a lot			0
i 'm a little lonely too			0
but i 'm learning to fill that in with things that are not like browsing @entity123 or hanging on the @entity31			1
" the @entity31 has become our hedge against solitude			1
i admit , i have been guilty of glancing at my smartphone to scroll down a social media feed and thus feel immediately plugged in			2
but over the years -- and especially since i 've become a parent -- i 've learned to wean myself away from an always online life to spend more face time with family , friends and real world things like parks , picnics and play dates			1
and yet the @entity31 is just so seductive			1
some crave the sweet lightness of an @entity141 sunset			0
many are addicted to social media 's short - term rewards like scoring a re-tweet			2
and yes , a few of us enjoy an occasional hit of downward comparison by laughing at the mishaps of others on fail blog			0
but in addition to the fluff and frivolity , our lives require meaning and significance			0
thankfully , that does happen -- and often -- on the @entity31			2
collective action online has launched groundbreaking new projects , saved women from human trafficking and sparked a revolution			0
the faces of @entity167 's ' @entity166 ' but as much as we want to give our modern lives weight , it ca n't be just that			2
we desire the sweet frivolities of the internet as well			0
and like real world junk food , a spoonful of click - through sugar can be good for the soul every now and then			0
this just in : @entity1 anchor looks at @entity152			0

@entity49 : the @entity31 dominates our workspace and owns our life space as well
many @entity35 spend at least eight hours a day staring at a *computer* or smartphone screen
blogger @entity70 decided on year - long self - imposed @entity31 *ban* to reclaim his life
" i know i am most productive when i do n't have the internet on . i disconnect , " he says
