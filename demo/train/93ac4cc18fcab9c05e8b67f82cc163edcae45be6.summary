for many people , it is a word that signals the end of the week			0
but in @entity4 , @entity5 , friday , august 16 , will mark a new beginning			1
it will be the first day of school since an @entity10 tornado ravaged the town this spring , killing 24 people -- including seven students at @entity15 school			1
@entity16 and other schools in @entity4 have a special place in the heart of @entity20			1
he is a native of the city and , in july , became the superintendent of the public schools system			1
for @entity26 and others , the approaching school year is generating a mixture of feelings			2
" there 's not any one emotion : excited , happy and there 's also some grief still there			0
we are about rebuilding , moving forward -- not just for the school district , but also for the community , " says @entity20 , who is himself a product of the @entity4 school system			1
a total of 26 schools were impacted by the combination of the may 20 tornado and another storm several days later			1
as a result , @entity20 estimates those properties suffered at least $ 55 million in damages			1
@entity48 and another school , @entity50 , were considered total losses after taking direct hits			2
both schools will have temporary locations this year , with groundbreakings set to take place soon on new foundations			2
it 's a plan @entity20 says will put the two buildings on track to re-open in august of 2014			0
and as @entity4 students prepare to hit the books this week , their teachers are stocking up on supplies and readying their classrooms , thanks to donations from corporations , charities and the public			2
to date , @entity20 says much of that assistance has come in the form of products			0
but he adds that , as rebuilding nears completion , the school district 's cash reserves will be stretched			2
and he stresses that money will be critical to the system 's daily operations going forward			0
" we want to rebuild bigger and better and for student safety			0
monetary donations in the form of cash for tornado relief to our general fund would be very helpful			0
we do ask donors to be specific about where they want the money to go			0
a lot of checks and money orders have said ' tornado relief to @entity4 public schools			1
' we 've worked hard to keep that separate so we can track where that goes			0
" one way you can assist is through the rising from the @entity102 fund , which can be accessed through @entity15 or directly at @entity103			0
for those who prefer to donate via phone , @entity20 encourages them to call ( 405 ) 735 - 4223			0
and the superintendent has a message for those who continue to keep the residents of @entity4 in their thoughts : " we are strong , we are resilient			1
we are moving forward , rebuilding and doing what 's best for the community with the understanding that we wo n't forget that day or the families and lives affected by the storm			1
we 're here for the long haul			0
