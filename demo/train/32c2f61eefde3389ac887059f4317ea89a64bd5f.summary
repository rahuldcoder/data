no offense to high school volleyball player @entity4 ( i totally just teared up watching her famous baseball dad 's proud - papa reaction to her highlight reel ) , but i 'm glad someone went home last night			1
after top 12 contestant @entity11 was disqualified on wednesday , i thought the whole week might be a wash			1
@entity13 and @entity14 joined @entity4 in the bottom three , so they all sat glowering like three icky girls that the stupid , stupid little boys refused to pick for their kickball teams at recess			1
do n't they know how well those girls can wail ? that was a really poor analogy , though , because 1 ) kickball and recess are pointless , unlike " @entity25 " which is everything , and 2 ) it 's likely the female vote that landed three ladies on the stools of doom in the first place			1
please start voting for your sisters , sisters ! i know we all have a lot of texting to do , but you can find time to dial in for @entity41 's hair and @entity13 within the same hour , i promise			1
try it ! @entity43 dismissed @entity4 immediately following her " sing for your life " rehash of " @entity45 " by @entity48 and @entity49 , but earlier in the episode @entity51 confirmed that the judges will get to use a " save " in this season 's horse race			1
any time from now until the @entity59 , our steamy " @entity58 " lifeguards @entity43 , @entity56 , and @entity57 can rescue a contestant from the big bad sea of possible elimination			1
remember last year , when the judges used their season 10 save on @entity65 two weeks before presumed frontrunner @entity66 was eliminated ? i can see them holding out on this year 's get - out - of - jail - free card unless @entity69 is in danger			1
i can also see @entity51 instituting a " @entity72 " out of nowhere so that he could keep his favorite pretty pony @entity71 around			1
oh , how @entity51 teases his pretty pony ! his attempts to fool @entity76 into thinking he 's in the bottom three have been hilariously bad for three weeks running			1
this time , @entity51 tried to blame @entity79 's obscure song choice from wednesday 's performance show			1
" unfortunately , my man , that has cost you ... ... ...			2
. being away from your family this summer , ' cause you 're going on the tour ! " do n't ever stop , @entity51			2
keep on letting those crawfishy creative juices fly			2
hmm , what else ? pretty uneventful show , to be honest			2
i did appreciate that this week 's ridiculous @entity91 , which took place in a " haunted house " ( @entity51 could barely get that out without guffawing ) , could easily have doubled as an ad for @entity97 's @entity96			2
( products from a @entity98			2
) way to keep the theme of the week going , anyway			0
@entity102 , who used to have a first name but nope not anymore , showed up all high on life from tuesday night 's hookup with @entity71 at the @entity106			0
he and his band played " out of @entity111 " from their new album " @entity110			0
" right away i felt that @entity102 's keyboardist had a decidedly @entity114 vibe , and then as i unfocused my eyes a little ( it 's a good way to relax and hear the music better ) i started pretending that the lanky guitarist on the left was @entity120			0
and maybe @entity102 was present - day @entity121 ? so all in all it was a fun few minutes for me			0
for you ? oh , i was also pleasantly surprised by @entity124 on her single " @entity125			0
" she was just stomping all over that stage , grooving with her guitarists who were very excited to be rocking out on a @entity124 song , and pausing at just the right times to bask in the spotlight and dramatically toss around her miles of weave			0
i thought she sounded great			0
my vague impressions of @entity124 and @entity134 had merged over the years into one tiny , sequined , gelatinous blob prior to this			0
so now that i 've confirmed they 're two different people , i 'm pretty sure i choose this one ! @entity124 truly won my heart with that silver fringed scarf			0
( " @entity141 " premiere in three days , y'all			0
) okay , what are your thoughts on the top 11 results ? were you surprised that @entity146 uses email ? would you award @entity56 's dress a sparkly gold star ? it 's not like she needs another one ! see the full article at @entity0 click here to try 2 risk free issues of @entity0 Â© 2011 @entity0 and @entity157 all rights reserved .			0
