-- if your first tweet sets the tone for what you 're all about , what are we supposed to make of # @entity7 , @entity9 's first social media salutation ? is she expressing anxiety at plunging into the sometimes scalding cauldron of @entity13 ? or maybe just giving a shout - out to @entity15 ? @entity16 will tell , but @entity17 is not the first notable figure to make a cautious debut on social media			1
perhaps that 's understandable for someone like the former @entity24 intern , who has a complicated relationship with the public			0
but then what 's comedian @entity29 's excuse ? he debuted on the platform with the lukewarm greeting , " i 'm getting started on twitter , " in 2008			2
there 's certainly an art to it			0
most of us , thankfully , can blunder onto social platforms in anonymity , but if you 're @entity17 , @entity41 or @entity42 , you 're bound to get more attention than the average twit			1
