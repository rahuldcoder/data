-- critics who have compared president @entity1 's stance on government surveillance to that of hawkish former vice president @entity6 are missing his insistence on proper systematic balances , @entity1 said in an interview that aired monday			1
defending at length the recently revealed government programs that gather information about phone calls and internet usage , @entity1 said his focus has always been on allowing information to be gathered while ensuring necessary oversight			1
" some people say , ' well , you know , @entity1 was this raving liberal before			2
now he 's , you know , @entity6			1
' " @entity1 told @entity23 ' @entity22			1
" @entity6 sometimes says , ' yeah , you know ? he took it all lock , stock , and barrel			0
' my concern has always been not that we should n't do intelligence gathering to prevent terrorism , but rather are we setting up a system of checks and balances ? " @entity6 defends @entity37 , calls @entity1 's credibility ' nonexistent ' @entity1 's administration has faced a litany of questions since the disclosure of government programs that allow the @entity37 to collect millions of records from @entity46 telecommunications firms and @entity48 companies in the name of preventing terrorism			1
the source of the information , former @entity54 employee @entity53 , said he was moved to leak the top - secret documents because he felt the government was far overreaching its constitutional bounds in collecting the data			0
but @entity1 argued in the interview on monday that the system in place includes steps to prevent @entity46 ' rights against unlawful search and seizure from being violated			2
" what i can say unequivocally is that if you are a @entity46 person , the @entity37 can not listen to your telephone calls , and the @entity37 can not target your e-mails , " @entity1 said			1
@entity53 claims online @entity1 expanded ' abusive ' security " on this telephone program , you 've got a federal court with independent federal judges overseeing the entire program , " the president continued			0
" and you 've got @entity76 overseeing the program , not just the intelligence committee and not just the judiciary committee , but all of @entity76 had available to it before the last reauthorization exactly how this program works			0
" some members of @entity76 , including @entity86 members @entity87 and @entity88 , have questioned the notion they were given proper briefings on the @entity37 's program , however , and many lawmakers have said they first learned of the programs when they were revealed in news reports two weeks ago			1
@entity0 poll : @entity1 numbers plunge into generation gap asked in the interview whether the @entity37 's process should be more open , @entity1 said , " it is transparent			1
that 's why we set up the @entity104 court			0
" that body , however , operates in secret , and its locations are considered classified			0
it has approved the vast majority of the requests it has received for warrants , though those orders are also kept secret			0
an administration official said monday that @entity1 had asked his intelligence chief @entity115 to determine whether additional information about the data collection programs can be made public , part of what the official described as a " broader effort the president is undertaking to have a dialogue on protecting privacy in the digital age			2
" the swirling debate is grist for a " national conversation " about privacy and national security , @entity1 said			0
" not only about these two programs , but also the general problem of data , big data sets , because this is not going to be restricted to government entities , " he said			0
opinion : behind the slide in @entity1 's poll numbers			2

@entity1 says his stand on surveillance is not the same as @entity6 's
he tells @entity23 his *emphasis* is on " system of checks and balances "
@entity1 also says @entity76 was told *details* of @entity37 programs
