@entity0 -- the @entity3 @entity2 has rejected a condemned @entity6 inmate 's request that his execution be delayed as he attempts to prove his " actual innocence			1
" the justices without comment on monday turned aside two separate appeals from @entity12 , likely setting the stage for the state to set another execution date			1
@entity12 has gained international support for his long - standing claim he did not murder an off - duty @entity19 police officer more than two decades ago			1
monday 's ruling is the latest in a case that is procedurally complex but , legally , a simple claim of innocence			1
@entity12 was granted a stay of execution by the @entity3 @entity2 two hours before he was to be put to death in 2008 , and the court in 2009 ordered the @entity28 to take another look at the case			1
that court , after holding a hearing to review evidence , ruled in august that @entity12 " failed to show actual innocence " in the case			1
the @entity28 suggested that , for procedural reasons , @entity12 should take his appeal of its ruling directly to the @entity2			1
@entity12 ended up filing with both the @entity36 and the @entity2			2
the 11th @entity36 deflected the appeal in november , saying it agreed with the district court that the @entity2 was the correct place for the filing			0
@entity12 then took his case to the @entity3 @entity2 in january , filing two pleas			1
one sought review of the @entity6 federal judge 's rejection of the innocence claim , and the other asked for a test of the 11th @entity36 's refusal to review the case			1
the justices on monday turned down both pleas without comment			1
@entity12 ' sister said monday that she is " very disappointed " by the @entity2 's rejection			2
@entity56 said @entity12 ' attorney told her they would continue to pursue all possible legal options , including a possible re-petition of the @entity61			2
she said she had not spoken to @entity12 about monday 's decision but expected his attorney to call him soon			2
@entity64 said she does n't want the case to be moved back to @entity19 , where @entity12 was tried and convicted for the 1989 murder , because she does n't think he will " get a fair chance " there			1
witnesses said @entity12 , then 19 , and two others were harassing a homeless man in a @entity73 parking lot when off - duty officer @entity74 came to the man 's assistance			2
they testified that @entity12 shot @entity74 twice and fled			0
since @entity12 ' conviction in 1991 , seven of the nine witnesses against him have recanted their testimony			0
no physical evidence was presented linking @entity12 to the killing of the policeman			0
but upon reviewing @entity12 ' claims of innocence , the @entity28 for the @entity84 found in august that @entity12 " vastly overstates the value of his evidence of innocence			1
" " some of the evidence is not credible and would be disregarded by a reasonable juror , " judge @entity91 wrote in a 172 - page opinion			0
" other evidence that mr. @entity12 brought forward is too general to provide anything more than smoke and mirrors , " the court found			0
@entity99 , which is monitoring the case , expressed disappointment monday that the @entity2 had rejected the appeals			0
" it appears that the justice system is comfortable allowing someone to be executed when there are lingering doubts about guilt in the case			0
no objective person could confidently determine that @entity12 is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt from the evidence available now in his case			2
that leaves an ominous cloud hanging over an irreversible sentence such as the death penalty , " the international human rights group said in a statement			0
" the @entity118 , as the final fail - safe , has the opportunity to commute his sentence to life and prevent the possibility of executing an innocent person			0
" prominent figures ranging from the pope to the musical group @entity127 have asked @entity6 to grant @entity12 a new trial			0
other supporters include celebrities @entity130 and @entity132 ; world leaders such as former president @entity134 and former archbishop @entity135 ; and former and current @entity3 lawmakers @entity136 , @entity138 and @entity139			0
@entity1 @entity2 producer @entity140 contributed to this report .			0

the justices turned aside without comment two appeals from @entity12
the action likely sets the stage for the state to set another execution date
the ruling is latest in case that is procedurally complex but , legally , a simple innocence claim
