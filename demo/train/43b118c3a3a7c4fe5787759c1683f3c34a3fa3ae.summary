" nothing in the proxy was intended to minimize this tragedy or diminish the impact it has had on those who lost loved ones			0
everyone at @entity11 continues to mourn the loss of these friends and colleagues			2
" the statement did not address the controversy over the decision to give out cash awards despite the oil spill disaster			1
that includes a $ 200,000 salary increase for @entity11 president and chief executive officer @entity48 , whose base salary will increase from $ 900,000 to $ 1.1 million , the @entity10 report said			2
@entity48 's bonus was $ 374,062 , according to the report , which @entity11 filed friday			0

the well was capped three months later , but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the @entity3			0
in january , president @entity87 's @entity86 on the @entity88 and @entity89 released a report that spread blame for the accident among @entity11 , @entity93 -- which leased the rig -- and @entity95 , which installed the rig 's cement casing			2
the commission said problems with deepwater drilling are " systemic " and that only " significant reform " will prevent another disaster			0
another report released march 23 determined that the oil spill was caused by a piece of drill pipe trapped in the rig platform 's blowout preventer , a device intended to stop oil from flowing into the @entity3			0
the report was commissioned by various @entity82 agencies , including the @entity113 and the @entity114			0
