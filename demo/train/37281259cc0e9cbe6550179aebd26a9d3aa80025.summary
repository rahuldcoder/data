-- @entity3 security forces have summarily executed at least 101 people , including civilians , since late 2011 in attacks on cities and towns , @entity1 said in a report released monday			1
the report " documents the involvement of @entity3 forces and pro-government shabeeha militias in summary and extrajudicial executions of defecting soldiers , opposition fighters and opposition supporters , as well as civilians who appeared to have had no part in the confrontation with the authorities other than being residents of opposition strongholds , " according to the human rights organization			1
the 25 - page report , " in cold blood : summary executions by @entity31 and @entity32 , " was based on more than 30 interviews with witnesses to the executions , @entity1 said			1
while it was not possible to verify the exact numbers of victims of such executions , the organization said it had documented 12 cases in @entity38 and @entity40 governorates involving at least 101 victims since december 2011			2
@entity1 said it had received reports of other incidents , but only included in its report incidents where eyewitnesses were interviewed			1
" at least 85 victims were described by witnesses as residents who did not take part in the fighting , including women and children , " the report said			1
" in a desperate attempt to crush the uprising , @entity3 forces have executed people in cold blood , civilians and opposition fighters alike , " said @entity54 , emergencies researcher at @entity1			1
" they are doing it in broad daylight and in front of witnesses , evidently not concerned about any accountability for their crimes			2
" international human rights law " unequivocally prohibits summary and extrajudicial executions , " the organization said			2
many of the reported executions took place last month			0
on march 11 and 12 , for instance , 47 people -- mostly women and children -- were killed in three neighborhoods in the city of @entity40 , the report said			1
also march 11 , 13 men were killed at the @entity84 mosque in @entity38 , according to @entity1			1
and on march 3 , 25 men were executed during a search and arrest operation in the @entity89 neighborhood in the city of @entity40			0
" in these cases , @entity3 security forces , operating alone or together with pro-government shabeeha militias , captured and executed people who were trying to escape as the army took over their towns , shot or stabbed people in their homes as they entered the captured towns , or executed detained residents while conducting house searches , " the report said			1
one resident of @entity40 ' hard - hit @entity40 neighborhood , identified in the report as " @entity105 , " a pseudonym , reported his brother and four of his neighbors were executed on march 2			2
the army first entered his neighbors ' house , he said , dragged the four men outside , and killed them with knives in front of their families			2
the soldiers then entered @entity105 's house and shot at him and his brother as they raised their hands , he reported			0
@entity105 was injured and his brother was killed			2
in addition , at least 16 opposition fighters were shot at point - blank range by @entity3 forces after they had been captured or wounded			0
the report raises " concerns that the army had adopted a policy , official or unofficial , of executing opposition fighters , " @entity1 said			1
in one case in @entity131 , an opposition fighter , his leg injured by machine - gun fire , " was lying on the street and we could not rescue him , as the army was firing and shooting at our position , " a second fighter told @entity1			1
" he was twisting with pain and could n't escape			0
" then a tank approached ; around 15 soldiers in military uniforms surrounded our comrade and started insulting him and kicking him , " the anonymous fighter said			0
" they were shouting to us that we should surrender or they would kill him			0
then they put a black cloth around his eyes , handcuffed him and one of them finished him with an ( assault rifle )			0
when they left , we buried him in the graveyard in the village			0
" other witnesses reported finding bodies that appeared to have been sexually violated , and some said they had heard accounts of women being raped in towns taken under the army 's control , according to the report			1
the organization called on the @entity172 @entity171 " to ensure that any @entity172 mission mandated to supervise the six - point plan brokered by the @entity176 envoy @entity175 would be in a position to document such crimes			0
" the @entity171 should refer the situation in @entity3 to the @entity180 , @entity1 said			1
it appeared doubtful monday whether the @entity3 government would follow through on its pledge to withdraw troops from cities nationwide			0
the @entity3 @entity185 said sunday it would not commit to pulling forces only to have " armed terrorist groups " attack			0
the @entity3 government has consistently blamed violence in the country on " armed terrorist groups			0
" but @entity172 and other world leaders have said the government is lethally cracking down on dissidents seeking true democracy and an ouster of president @entity195 , whose family has ruled @entity3 for 42 years .			0
