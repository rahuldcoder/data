-- opening in select @entity4 theaters next week , the documentary " @entity2 " tells the story of a @entity7 teenager who became famous in the mid- 2000s when she was shown on tv giving president @entity9 a kiss on the cheek			1
@entity14 filmmaker @entity13 's movie is well - timed			1
@entity9 won his third term as @entity7 's president last month and will officially take power in may			1
he is finishing up a stint as prime minister , as he was limited to two consecutive terms as president			0
while not well - known in the @entity23 , @entity22 will always be a symbol of @entity9 's power and of the first generation to come of age in @entity28 , after her tumultuous tenure as the spokeswoman for @entity31 , a nationalist youth movement that @entity9 officials created in 2005			1
@entity31 organized mass marches in support of the @entity7 president , proactively heading off opposition to @entity9 at every turn			1
as @entity31 gained thousands of members , the provincial but ambitious teen from the @entity42 suburbs was rewarded for being its mouthpiece			1
she got a car , an apartment and even a television show			0
the film shows @entity22 as she begins to question it all after befriending independent journalists who criticize @entity9			1
audiences watch @entity22 's disillusionment with @entity31 turn to anguish when one of those reporters is savagely beaten by attackers he suspects are @entity31 members			1
" @entity2 " took the world cinematography award at this year 's @entity59			0
watch the trailer @entity0 spoke with @entity13 by phone from her home in @entity14			0
@entity0 : why did you want to make this movie ? @entity13 : i wanted to make a contemporary portrait of the first generation to come of age in the new @entity7			1
for research , i spoke to a lot of young people @entity22 's age			1
... i traveled to @entity7 for three or four weeks and i spoke only with young people , 18 to 20 , in big cities and the countryside , who were born exactly at the time the @entity77 was collapsing			1
@entity0 : why focus on @entity22 ? @entity13 : when @entity22 was very young , and @entity7 was changing to a capitalist society , the middle class gained more money , more possibilities to send their young people to good schools and to take vacations abroad			1
it had changed the attitudes among the young people and the population all in all			0
so people were much more optimistic and they really looked up to @entity9 and ( were ) feeling proud about @entity7			1
i wanted to portray that side as well , and that 's also one of the reasons i chose to portray a person who was a spokesperson for @entity9 's youth movement , @entity31			1
@entity0 : @entity22 was someone who certainly believed in @entity31 , which describes itself as this kind of democratic @entity101 movement that @entity9 and the presidential administration was very much for			1
things were going well for her			0
suddenly she had this great fame			0
then she meets journalists and starts spending time with journalists			0
what does that cause to happen in her life ? what happens ? what goes wrong ? @entity13 : @entity31 actually means " ours			1
" in @entity31 they believe very much in @entity7 and that @entity7 should be the leader of 21st century , and to make ( the country ) the leader of the 21st century we need to support the ruling power			1
and if you do n't support the ruling power , if you 're critical towards @entity9 , you 're basically labeled an enemy			2
a lot of these young liberal journalists that @entity22 started to hang out with , they were very critical about @entity9 and his ruling			1
so @entity22 gets into this crowd and she 's warned by the leadership of @entity31 that she should not mix with these people , that she could not in daytime believe in @entity9 and then in nighttime be friends with people who would criticize him			1
@entity0 : can you give our audience some perspective on why @entity31 was so important to both @entity9 and why their voice was so important on the national political scene ? if there are a lot of young people ( in the @entity4 ) who band together and decide they want to support president @entity143 or some other politician , it 's not as if that group is going to make headlines every single day and their voice is going to be the top			1
@entity13 : @entity31 was formed from above			2
it 's not like a grass - roots organization			0
it 's not like a young person would wake up in the suburb and then think " oh , i have to go out and support @entity9 and then form @entity31			1
" ... @entity31 was formed by the political top			2
its former leader is now a kind of youth minister			0
@entity31 had a very specific mission			2
( @entity31 , the filmmaker adds , was @entity9 's way of heading off anything like 2005 's " @entity162 " in the @entity163			1
protesters took to the streets claiming that the re-election of the country 's president had been rigged			1
demonstrators successfully demanded a recount that revealed the leader of the opposition party had actually won			0
) @entity9 was very much afraid that young people would take to the streets and make revolution as well as what happened in the @entity163			2
@entity31 was formed to counteract something like that			2
during parliamentary elections four years ago , @entity31 has this role to go in and occupy squares in major cities , mainly in @entity42 and @entity182			2
they would apply for ( permits ) to stay on the square and use the whole day for their action to prevent others from using the space			0
we see in the film the different methods they used to fight any opposition			0
@entity0 : how , logistically , did you go about making the film , considering your characters were in jeopardy all the time ? ( the independent journalist who was beaten , @entity195 , wrote a @entity201 op - ed from his hospital room saying he suspected @entity31 members were behind the attack			2
he wrote that one of his fingers needed to be amputated , his jaw and leg were broken and he had head injuries			0
) @entity13 : what was difficult was that in the beginning , @entity22 wanted to draw a very positive picture of @entity31			1
i kept telling her i wanted to tell ( both sides )			0
she most of the time , especially in the beginning , would make this picture of @entity31 almost like a boy scout movement			2
as filming progressed , and she started to meet people who were criticizing @entity31 , she actually still tried to keep away from meeting some of her new friends who had been critical toward @entity31			2
she was in a difficult process herself			0
even to talk about it and let me see would have made it real to her			0
@entity0 : what is @entity22 up to now and what does she think of the film ? @entity13 : she is pr manager for a foreign investment firm			2
she is quite successful , but she has withdrawn from politics and from liberal journalists			0
she felt like she was very manipulated by both sides			0
when she saw the film , she told me she felt " 50/50			0
" she liked the film , and thought it was a good portrait of her , but that it took the side of the journalists too much			0
@entity0 : what role is @entity31 playing right now in @entity7 politics ? we saw an unprecedented number of @entity243 protesters take to the streets just before the march election			1
@entity246 : during the presidential election , @entity31 were saying that there would be 20,000 ( members ) on the streets of @entity42 fighting the opposition			2
there has been activity , ( but ) it 's a little difficult to say what			0
the thing with @entity31 is that they grow every time there is an election			2
they tend to shrink during nonelection periods			0
people are saying that @entity31 will disappear , but i 'm not sure about that			0
it 's a fantastic tool for the ruling power			0
