@entity0 -- when @entity2 returned to the pagoda , or tower , where she had been abandoned as a baby she was overwhelmed by what had happened there 11 years earlier			2
" i remember thinking , ' wow , i wonder if my birth family hid behind those bushes or something ' " said @entity2 , now 18 years old , on returning to @entity8 , @entity9			1
" i felt very disengaged throughout the entire process			0
i kind of removed myself from the situation because it was too emotionally challenging			0
" @entity2 is one of tens of thousands of children -- 95 % percent of whom are girls -- who have been adopted from @entity9 since its government ratified international adoption in 1992			1
in 1979 , @entity9 officials introduced the one - child policy requiring that couples have only one child to slow the country 's massive population growth			1
could @entity9 's one - child policy change ? with only one chance to pass on the family name , many @entity9 couples are unhappy having a girl and either abort the pregnancy or abandon the baby			1
because of this , @entity9 is one of the easiest countries from which to do an international adoption , according to @entity38 , a @entity39 - based adoption agency that specializes in @entity9			1
the process takes around two years and costs between us $ 19,000 and $ 23,000			0
many of those adoptees eventually visit @entity9 to experience their heritage first - hand			1
being @entity9 helped to define @entity2 's childhood growing up in @entity45 , @entity46			1
she and her sister , who is also adopted from @entity9 , attended a saturday school to learn @entity9 language and culture while other children were playing soccer or baseball			1
@entity2 was home schooled until partway through high school and attended a group of students that never treated her differently			0
however , when she started attending a charter school where she was the only @entity59 in a group of 40 students things changed			0
" i did feel much like an outsider			2
i had the darkest skin , the only head of black hair in a sea of blond and brown , " she said			0
" as the ' representative @entity59 , ' the kids fed back to me the typical stereotypes about @entity59 -- super smart , good in math , short ... while they did n't mean harm , it did hurt			2
" spending four - and - a - half months in @entity75 in 2011 studying @entity76 changed her outlook			0
" i feel very proud to be both @entity9 and @entity39 , " she said			1
" i know that those things will always be a part of me whether i live in @entity9 or in @entity39			1
" today , @entity2 is a board member of @entity9 's @entity80 -- an organization founded by high school girls to bring together @entity9 adoptees around the world			1
@entity85 and her husband , @entity86 , adopted their daughter june from @entity9 when she was two years old			1
after deciding they wanted children , the couple chose to adopt internationally because of the positive experience @entity85 's sister had adopting children from @entity95			2
they applied for a non-special needs adoption in 2006 , @entity85 said			0
but after nearly two years and no match , they put their names on the list for special needs children -- meaning the child requires some form of medical treatment			2
finally in the fall of 2008 , the couple was connected with june , who had been born with a cleft lip that has been repaired			0
as she grew older , june enjoyed attending @entity9 cultural events so much that , at the age of five , she asked her parents if she could visit @entity9			1
" we were going to take her back eventually , " said @entity86 , a librarian in @entity115 , @entity116			2
" i was a little surprised because it was a little early , but we felt that if she was asking to go she must have a need to go			0
" the family made the trek to @entity9 last month visiting the @entity124 , @entity75 's @entity125 and june 's orphanage in @entity128 province , among other sites			1
" she was joyful the whole time , " @entity85 , a lawyer , said of her daughter			0
" it was clear that she had a large connection to the place			0
" upon visiting with the foster family that tended to their daughter june 's parents were overcome with emotion			2
" we could see the love that they had on their faces for her and the sadness that they did n't have her anymore , " @entity85 said			0
" i know they are happy that she was adopted but it was easy to see that they were sad too			2
" six - year - old june already shows a great deal of interest in her @entity9 heritage , but it 's not always easy to explain			1
" she asks why her parents could n't take care of her and we try and answer that as best as we can			2
it 's hard , " her father said			0
" ( hearing about her adoption ) is sort of a comfort to her			0
she likes to hear her story told			0
" the family plans to return to @entity9 regularly			1
" the bottom line for us is that we chose to do an international adoption			0
she did n't have any other choice , " @entity85 said			0
" so i feel as a mom it is my responsibility to teach her			1
" @entity177 * and her husband are taking their five - year - old daughter to @entity9 in september -- something they decided before they even brought her home			1
" we 're doing it in stages			0
she wo n't go back to the province where she was born this time , " @entity177 said			2
" we will just go to the major cities and the touristy , lovely places			0
" when they picked their daughter up from the orphanage , she was 10 months old and could barely sit up , but after bringing her home to @entity197 her development quickly improved			0
@entity177 said she wants her daughter to have a positive opinion of her birth country despite the challenges she has already faced in life			0
" i do n't want her to think ' they did n't want me ' ... or for it to be even in the realm of possibility , " @entity177 said			0
" i want her to see @entity9 as a good thing			1
" as for @entity2 , the high school senior said she wants to take a year off before college to volunteer in a @entity9 orphanage			1
" i 'm so blessed to have been adopted , " she said			2
" i feel compelled to go back to @entity9 and volunteer and give back to the kids that were n't adopted			1
" * name has been changed to protect her from @entity218 law prohibiting adopted children from being identified in the media .			1
