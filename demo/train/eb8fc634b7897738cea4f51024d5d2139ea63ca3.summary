after a siege at a @entity4 mall two years ago , the @entity1 started staging mock attacks in @entity8 shopping centers during off hours to test their readiness , an official said			1
more than 60 people died when @entity13 militants raided an upscale mall in @entity15 and held shoppers hostage for four days			1
the terror group released a video saturday calling for similar attacks in malls in the @entity8 , @entity21 and the @entity22			1
although @entity24 and the @entity1 say they are not aware of a specific , credible plot against @entity8 malls , they 've worked to improve security in light of the attack in @entity4			1
last year , the @entity1 teamed up with various malls nationwide to increase preparedness , a law enforcement official told @entity5			1
it tested the readiness of @entity38 teams by staging fake attacks at malls when they were closed , the official said			2
since then , the @entity1 has had a program that works with malls to improve security , the official said			1
the @entity45 - based terror group has limited past attacks to its home country and neighboring @entity4 and @entity48			1
but as other terror groups such as @entity51 have made vicious headlines , @entity13 may be feeling left out , @entity8 officials said			1
the @entity24 and the @entity1 say they believe the video was the militants ' attempt to compete for attention and recruits with other terrorist groups , one official said			1
@entity13 's strength is compromised , a @entity8 law enforcement official said , and while the group has the desire to see a mall attack in the @entity8 , it probably is n't able to do so			1
despite what some officials described as an attention ploy , security was beefed up in malls listed as potential targets			1
homeland security secretary @entity71 said there 's no credible evidence suggesting a @entity8 mall attack is in the works			1
but shoppers should be vigilant nonetheless , he said			0
" there will be enhanced security ( at malls ) , " he said sunday			1
" but public vigilance , public awareness and public caution in situations like this is particularly important , and it 's the environment we 're in , frankly			2
" stressing that there is no known credible threat to any mall , @entity71 cautioned that attacks can be unpredictable			1
" i wo n't know about when the next bad actor is going to strike , " he said			0
in @entity93 , @entity94 , home to @entity95 , one of the shopping centers named in the video , law enforcement agencies said they remain vigilant			0
" enhanced security measures to include additional personnel have been implemented and all information is being monitored , " local police said in a statement sunday			0
the mall said it takes any " potential threat seriously " and has implemented extra security			2
" we have protocols in place that as things happen we can ramp up and we 've implemented some of those strategies , " said @entity93 police chief @entity107			0
" some of them are things that people would n't notice			0
" @entity116 , a security consultant to the @entity95 , said that dedicated explosive - detection dog teams patrol the mall			2
officers are trained specifically in behavior - detection techniques , he said			0
the mall also has its own intelligence branch and a station where teams monitor chatter on social media , according to @entity116			0
the @entity126 in @entity127 , @entity21 , which was also named in the video , said it has boosted security and is working with federal and local law enforcement agencies			2
" @entity21 will not be intimidated by threats from any terrorist organization , " public safety minister @entity131 said			0
the video also mentioned shopping centers in the @entity22			0
@entity136 said there is no " evidence of an imminent threat " to its shopping centers , but it 's taking steps to ensure safety			0
@entity22 @entity143 also said it is aware of the video			2
@entity146 , a leader in the @entity45 community in @entity148 , said radicalization is a great concern			0
" the root cause of the problem is poverty , identity crisis and a lack of education , " he told @entity5			0
" we have to create projects and programs and opportunities for these young men to focus on the future and positive life - changing things			0
" the @entity45 community has met to discuss the video and to address it in a unified manner , he said , likening radicalization to a disease			0
" we have to work hard for our community and families , to dismantle this ; it 's a grave concern , " @entity146 said			2
" with social media ... it has really given the best opportunities for this evil to affect all communities and ages			0
" although @entity13 's past attacks have been limited to @entity182 , the militants have heavily recruited in @entity148 , where young men have been slipping away to join the terror group			1
the city is home to the largest @entity45 population in the @entity8			2
in addition to @entity4 and @entity45 , @entity13 has also struck in @entity48 , where it killed dozens gathered to watch a @entity191 soccer match in @entity192 five years ago			1
@entity4 and @entity48 have sent their forces to neighboring @entity45 to battle the extremists			2
as the attacks get more daring , the international community has rallied to fight the militants			0
last year , a @entity8 airstrike in @entity45 killed the @entity13 leader			1
the terror group later replaced him and vowed to avenge his death			1
@entity13 started off with a goal of waging a war against the @entity45 government in an effort to implement a stricter form of @entity209 law , or @entity210			2
it has since shifted focus to terrorist attacks in @entity45 and beyond			0
@entity5 's @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 contributed to this report .			0
