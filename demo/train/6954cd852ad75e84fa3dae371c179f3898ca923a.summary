few books truly invade a national psyche			2
when a work manages to do so for 1,000 years , it 's a pretty spectacular feat. enter " @entity9 " , or @entity9 , a literary epic so large ( the largest , in fact ) that it measures the length of @entity7 's " @entity6 " and " @entity8 " combined			1
it is one of @entity15 's national treasures , and holds a place next to the @entity17 in many @entity15 households			1
it is difficult to overestimate the importance of " @entity21 " in @entity15 culture			1
even today , it remains a staple in the canon of bedtime literature read to children			2
it is among the first books taught in @entity15 classrooms			1
political candidates will reference parables from the tome in election speeches			2
as noted by the @entity38 , during the protests that characterized the 2009 elections , demonstrators adopted the chant , " we are all @entity40 , " a reference both to a 19 - year old victim killed by security forces , and to one of poem 's tragic heroes			1
almost as impressive as the text itself is the commitment of its author			2
a @entity52 poet by the name of @entity54 dedicated 30 years of his life to collecting folklore , mythologies and oral histories and turning it into 60,000 rhyming couplets			1
today , @entity54 has found a disciple in the form of @entity62 , a @entity63 - based @entity15 filmmaker who has logged over 10,000 hours illustrating an elaborate new @entity65 translation			1
" he did n't have a computer , " quips @entity62			1
" if he did , it would n't have taken him 30 years			0
" rather than sketch the book from scratch , @entity62 crafted together thousands of images of @entity52 art and painstakingly layered them in what amounts to a 500 - page collage			1
" i wanted to introduce the visual culture of the @entity76 and create something modern , " he explains			0
interactive : press freedom in the @entity80 " painting struck me as very pass√© ; no one sits down and paints anymore			0
i wanted to be like a dj , but instead of collecting sound and music and changing the tempo or tone to create a new composition , i would use lithographs and miniatures from the 14th to early 19th century			1
" @entity91 , the curator of @entity92 at the @entity93 in @entity94 , has dubbed @entity62 's version " the ' @entity9 ' of the digital age "			1
" his is both a departure and an evolution , " she says			0
" the book is slick and modern , and very much informed by the visual universe of the internet and tv and film			0
" @entity104 , the chairman of the @entity105 at @entity107 ' @entity106 , provided the @entity65 translation , and -- along with @entity62 's wife , @entity109 -- helped to bring the language alive for 21st century , @entity65 - speaking audiences			1
" this is the world that has been used to the language of movies for 100 years -- since the invention of @entity118 film			0
the people we are trying to reach are used to fanciful stories like ' @entity122 ' and ' @entity123			0
' i could n't pretend that they did n't already have that exposure , " explains @entity104			0
" to keep the reader hooked and addicted to the narrative , @entity128 and i made the decision to tell a character - driven , rather than event - driven story			1
" read more : @entity134 cartoonists court controversy while @entity139 readers may have had limited contact with the epic , several of the tales encapsulated in the work should look familiar			2
in one love story , the hero , @entity142 , meets his beloved by climbing up her ladder - like locks			1
the stars of that tale are also star - crossed in a similar manner to their romantic successors , @entity151			2
other narratives have elements of " @entity154 " and even @entity155 ( the orphaned babe raised by wild animals )			0
what @entity104 finds most fascinating , however , is the role of women in the saga			2
" it 's amazing , because they 're anything but passive , " he notes			0
" the women in these stories basically hunt and sexually conquer their men			1
they are advisers -- not shy to offer their opinion			0
there are villainous women and heroic women			2
" perhaps one of the most riveting stories , though , is that of @entity54 himself , who after dedicating his life to collecting stories , died bankrupt and embittered			0
it is a situation that @entity62 can appreciate			1
he funded much of the project himself , and during the nearly four years he worked on it , was pulling in little else by way of an income			0
halfway through the project , @entity109 fell pregnant			0
" two weeks before my daughter was born , i had $ 27.37 in my bank account			0
i told @entity128 take a screen shot , " he recalls			0
" you have to have a certain passion and love and belief to sit down with no money and make something like that , " he says .			0

the @entity9 , a 1,000 - year old @entity52 epic , is a cultural mainstay in @entity15 .
@entity15 filmmaker @entity62 recently made a *contemporary* , illustrated version .
each page is composed of thousands of parts scanned from @entity52 miniatures and lithographs .
the story is made up of strong women who " sexually conquer " their men .
