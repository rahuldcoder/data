@entity1 , @entity0 -- when @entity4 won second place in the 1,500 - meters final at the @entity7 , he celebrated his well - deserved victory by waving two flags , that of the @entity11 and @entity12			1
he has every right to do so : after all , he has dual citizenship for both countries			1
some observers disagree with @entity4 's action			2
on @entity2 , @entity18 voiced his concerns that @entity4 was showing disloyalty to the @entity11 even while he 's wearing the @entity11 jersey			2
opinion : @entity11 @entity7 athlete , @entity12 flag ? judging by the volume of comments in response to @entity18 's opinion , one would think that @entity4 had committed treason			1
one reader wrote , " he is pathetic			0
... go back to @entity12			2
you 're either @entity11 or not ! ! " ok , calm down			2
let 's not get too worked up here			0
@entity18 was right when he said that " it 's all about context			0
" like him , i personally do n't like @entity12 - @entity11 or undocumented @entity12 waving @entity12 flags protesting in the @entity11			1
but keep in mind , we live in @entity11 : a country where one can voice an opinion , however different it might be			2
we live in a land that has freedom of speech			0
but i believe @entity18 missed the larger point			0
@entity4 is not @entity12 - @entity11 but was born a @entity12 and became an @entity11			1
there is a reason one can have dual citizenship ; it means that one can have an allegiance for two countries			2
there is no conflict of interest			0
if governments can approve of dual citizenship , why ca n't individuals embrace it ? @entity18 asked : " where were the @entity57 - @entity11 athletes waving the @entity57 flag , or the @entity60 waving the @entity60 flag ? " maybe we do n't have that because @entity57 and @entity60 families emigrated to the @entity11 much earlier and their ties may not be as strong to their motherland			1
also , they are too far away from @entity67			0
however , @entity12 is so close to the @entity11 that @entity4 , or any other @entity12 or @entity68 - @entity11 , can just drive their car across the border			1
those people with @entity57 or @entity60 lineage ca n't just drive home : there 's too much water along the way , much more water than the @entity79			0
i found it interesting that @entity18 would say that most @entity68 he knows " would need a whole team of therapists to sort out their views on culture , national identity , ethnic pride and their relationship with mother @entity12			2
" i do n't see that , though i think some of my fellow @entity12 - @entity11 need therapists for other reasons			1
@entity18 also thinks that @entity12 - @entity11 are " the orphans of the @entity93 -- too @entity12 for the @entity11 , too @entity11 for the @entity12			2
" i have heard this before			0
maybe it 's just me , but i would n't need to see a therapist to accept being a second - generation @entity68 and embrace the culture of my grandparents			0
i am bilingual , bicultural and have two addresses : @entity1 , @entity0 , and @entity100			0
i have affinity for both the @entity11 and @entity12 , and that 's perfectly fine			2
in this increasingly global world we live in , do n't we have an appreciation for people who do not forget where they came from ? when i am in @entity100 , i certainly never forget that i am also an @entity11			1
on the @entity109 , for example , i once had a party that included @entity11 flags , hot dogs and hamburgers in order to educate my @entity12 friends about @entity11 culture			1
no one made a big deal about it			0
when i posted @entity18 's commentary about @entity4 on my @entity123 page , the reactions were not in @entity18 's favor			0
my friends , mostly @entity12 - @entity11 and @entity12 , looked at @entity4 's victory lap in a positive light			1
they know that @entity4 was representing the @entity11 and never doubted his devotion to the country that took him and his family in during hours of need			1
it 's just that , in a moment of pride , @entity4 wanted the world to know that he did n't forget his heritage			1
as one friend aptly put it , " identity , like borders , is porous and negotiable			0
" i like this statement because even though i was born and raised in @entity1 , i have no problem crossing borders , loving both @entity1 and @entity100			0
if i am ever recognized in @entity12 for any of my accomplishments , i will not hesitate to wear my @entity11 flag in honor of my country			1
sure , the @entity7 are a different story			0
the whole world is watching			0
while @entity7 athletes should always rally behind their team , it does not mean they have to subsume their individuality			0
we should admire individuals for their hard work and respect their decisions in how they wish to be recognized			0
@entity4 wanted to thank the @entity11 and also acknowledge @entity12 , the land of his forefathers			1
as i see the image of @entity4 running with two flags and embracing his dual citizenship , i sense no insolence			1
he did n't take off his @entity11 jersey ; the @entity12 flag is not prominently hanging over his head , it 's only dangling as some sort of secondary thought			1
it is clear he loves his adopted country			1
viva to @entity4 for being proud of who he is : someone who is @entity11 , but also has a part of @entity12 in him			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .			0

@entity176 : @entity4 has a right to wave two flags in his victory lap at the @entity7
@entity176 : @entity4 has dual citizenship for the @entity11 and @entity12
he says @entity4 wanted the world to know that he did n't forget his heritage
@entity176 : there is no doubt that @entity4 loves @entity11 , his adopted country
