-- forecasting future technology has never been easy			1
in the 1950s , scientists and technologists envisaged that by now the world would be free from disease , traversed by flying cars , and fueled by minerals from distant planets			2
such visions , of course , have not come to pass			2
but then again , as recently as 10 years ago , few would have envisaged that @entity12 - printed food , bionic body parts and invisibility cloaks were just around the corner			2
so , in what areas will the next major breakthroughs occur ? keeping in mind that prediction is more of an art than a science , @entity0 spoke to a host of design and technology experts -- from academics to magazine editors -- in search of what might well just be the shape of things to come			1
the editor according to @entity32 , editor - in - chief of influential design magazine @entity33 , the most high - impact developments over the next decade will be primarily in the areas of manufacturing and wearable technology			1
" new digital design tech , 3d printing , robotics and the emerging field of 3d scanning , plus exponential leaps in manufacturing -- together , they are putting really powerful tools into the hands of individuals , " he says			1
" in the same way that laptops revolutionized personal computing two decades ago and cheap video editing software did for film , so too there will now be a revolution in manufacturing			1
" for @entity57 , wearable technologies such as @entity56 point to another major evolution in design : the disappearance of objects altogether			1
" the broader movement in design no longer asks ' is something a nice object ? ' but rather ' how can we get rid of this completely ? ' " from wearable devices such as those being pioneered by sportswear manufacturer @entity70 , and @entity71 to digital tattoos and " things that you can swallow that will check you out from inside , ( such as ) a project that adds an artificial organ to help the body use water more sparingly " , @entity57 believes the future could well be defined by objects almost disappearing entirely			1
the curator @entity83 , the director of the @entity84 in @entity85 , controversially selected a simple website as the winning entry in the 2013 design awards			1
the government site @entity90 won , he said , because of its dramatic subjugation of form beneath function : " the overall winner this year is very interesting			0
it is apparently very simple , but it works beautifully			0
i think there is nothing more irritating than design that does n't work			2
" for @entity83 , the future of design is about how well an object fulfills its function , not just its aesthetic qualities			1
at the same time , @entity83 believes there is a revival of interest in physical objects , noting that 2012 was the first year in two decades that saw a rise in vinyl record sales			0
" i see design trying to get to grips with both the longing people have for the physical world and those other more slippery digital developments			1
people are still interested in tangible experience (...) you see that with the @entity125 , which is currently just making combs and shoehorns , but will soon be creating objects which are significantly more complicated			0
" the designer @entity127 , an industrial designer whose work covers aviation , transport , timepieces , consumer electronics and everything in between , says that the future of technology requires complete understanding of material structure : " you have to understand materials at a deep scientific or nano level			1
once you get to that level and understand ... you can reconstitute anything			0
" @entity127 points to the @entity143 -- an ultralight shoe with a knitted construction -- as an example of how future design will draw heavily on the latest thinking in science , health and manufacturing			1
" the way they are industrialized , the way they are woven			0
they put strength and structure where it is required			0
there are no aglets so they only need to be constructed with one material			0
they are so lightweight you hardly feel them			0
they promote ergonomic health in the way they adjust posture			0
" the academic professor @entity171 , @entity173 programme at the @entity174 in @entity85 , thinks we are on the brink of huge technological change			0
" some people believe that there are no big leaps to come , but then people said in the 18th century that man could never travel more than 40 miles per - hour			0
" @entity171 predicts that the next decades will bear witness to significant change			0
" we are within 20 years of developing an artificial brain capable of matching our own ... material developments in the nanotech field are starting to bear fruit ... ( and so is ) the field of synthetic biology , which can produce artificial muscle			1
" is it possible to distinguish genuine technological contenders , from those that will only ever be the realm of science fiction ? perhaps not			2
but @entity171 suggests he will be able to " answer that question in 50 years ' time , when i have got my feet up , sipping a cup of my @entity199 tea grown in the @entity200 , in front of a fire powered by synthetic bacteria and hovering on a comfort - pad - chair using reverse - magnetic forces whilst reading a copy of @entity208 's latest novel ( written by a quantum computer - cloned version of the man himself )			2
" in the meantime , he suggests we all sit back and enjoy the ride .			0

@entity0 spoke to a host of design and technology experts to see what future holds
key developments are in the field of wearable technology and 3d printing
best design is a *marriage* of technology , science and manufacturing techniques
digital tattoos and mind reading *headphones* give flavor of things to come
