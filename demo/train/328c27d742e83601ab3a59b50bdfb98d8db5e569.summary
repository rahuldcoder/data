for @entity13 's top competitions			1
the technology allows referees to make almost instant decisions on awarding goals if the ball has crossed the line			2
however , @entity13 president @entity21 advocates using extra officials behind the goal , a method used in the @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity27 's top division			1
the @entity28 , who won the @entity29 with his country in 1984 , prefers @entity13 to invest in grassroots football and develop young players rather than spend millions of dollars on installing @entity11 in stadia			1
" i prefer that we have more referees to see if there is a penalty foul and if the ball is going over the line , " @entity21 told @entity0			1
" we do n't need perfect camera to see the ball			0
" for the @entity24 , it 's too expensive , " added @entity21 , who despite his philosophical opposition to @entity11 , admitted it could be used during @entity44 if that was the consensus of @entity13 's executive and referee committees , set to be held in @entity28			1
estimating that @entity11 woud costs â ‚ ¬ 52 million to use in @entity24 matches , @entity21 said : " i prefer to give these millions of euros to grassroots , to the young players in football , to some infrastructures so they can play football			1
" @entity57 's top flight adopted @entity11 for the first time at the start of the 2013 - 14 season , while the @entity61 also uses the technology			1
@entity64 's top two divisions will make a decision on whether to use @entity11 for the 2014 - 15 campaign before the end of the current season			1
@entity72 's " ghost goal " against @entity73 in october , when @entity75 's header went into goal through a hole in the side of the net , illustrated the mistakes that can be made when techonology is n't used			2
but @entity21 insisted the example of @entity27 shows how using more officials can reduce refereeing errors			1
" if you want to make a point about five referees , you have to go to @entity27 because it 's been implemented for two years and is working very well , " he added			0
" thirty five national associations are using the five referees in the world			0
" but in @entity91 , there is only one referee			0
they do n't have the money to afford @entity11			2
it 's easier to have five referees that you do n't pay			0
" @entity21 's homeland will host an expanded @entity29 in 2016 -- with 24 teams set to compete compared to 16 in 2012 -- before the tournament changes format ahead of the 2020 edition			1
rather than one single country hosting @entity105 2020 , it will be played across 13 different @entity8 cities with the venues set to be announced following a vote in september			0
blog : can football change the world ? the pan-european format is @entity21 's way of marking the 60th " birthday " of the tournament and the former @entity117 player wants to see @entity118 host the final			1
" @entity118 lost against my country 6 - 5 ( in the vote for @entity44 ) and it is a long time that they have been bidding for some things , " added @entity21			1
" they bid for the @entity128 , they bid for the @entity129 and i think in the end it will be a beautiful festival for one week with the semifinal in a big country , a beautiful country ... like @entity135 , " said @entity21 , referring to the @entity118 city			2
critics have argued the expansion of teams in the @entity128 will dilute the quality of the competition , but @entity21 dismissed those fears			2
" i am a man of football , i never will propose to the national association something which is not good for the football , " he said			0
" i have to receive the feedback of the fifty - four national associations			0
fifty - two were in favor , two were not in favor : @entity64 and @entity57 , but they say we move with the majority			0
" i think 24 teams in @entity13 are good ( enough ) to win			1
that means that the quality of the football is not a problem			0
" i have to take care about what is good for the football and i only do it for the football			0
and to me , it was good for the football to extend to 24			2
" @entity21 has been head of @entity13 since 2007 and a bid by him for the presidency of @entity163 , football 's global governing body , has been mooted			1
the current @entity163 president @entity165 has been in the position since 1998 and he had announced his intention to step down from the role ahead of a presidential election in 2015			0
but he has since said he will reverse that decision if the @entity163 members ask him to remain			0
@entity21 , a @entity163 vice president , was tight - lipped on whether he will be running against @entity165 and his fellow @entity28 @entity172 , who announced his intention to run for the presidency in january			1
" i did n't think about that a lot because i am very busy and it 's so far , one year from now and we do n't know what could be , " said @entity21			2
" i have to speak with the national association of @entity13 , i have to travel and i do n't take the time to think about that			0
" i am working here			0
we have many projects ... after this work , perhaps i will think about @entity163 ... perhaps i do n't know			0

@entity21 *reiterates* his *preference* for extra officials over technology in football
@entity13 president says the cost of installing goal - line technology is *prohibitive*
@entity11 was introduced in the @entity5 at the start of the 2013 - 14 season
@entity21 *defends* @entity13 's decision to expand the @entity29 to 24 teams
