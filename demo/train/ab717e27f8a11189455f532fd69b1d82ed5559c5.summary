-- five hundred years ago as the @entity5 and @entity6 empires were carving up the @entity7 into colonial spheres , @entity2 's imperial competition in the @entity3 was equally intense			1
as the first to navigate around @entity10 's southern cape in the late 15th century , @entity6 landed upon @entity11 and beyond to @entity12 , establishing forts , outposts and colonies alongside the @entity17 coastal @entity3 kingdoms of @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 , quickly wresting control of the lucrative @entity25 - @entity24 spice trade routes from the @entity26 and @entity27			1
@entity31 , as the island of @entity29 was known under @entity6 rule , became a crucial trading hub for cinnamon , cardamom , black pepper and gems through agreements with the @entity38 , near present - day @entity39			1
but after @entity6 's economic collapse in the 1620s , the @entity40 took advantage of an invitation from the ruler of the @entity46 to oust the @entity6			1
but rather than return @entity6 forts to local control , the @entity47 deepened and expanded their colonial rule of the island			2
when @entity52 took over @entity47 colonies during the @entity54 , @entity29 became a @entity56 colony until independence in 1948			2
a half - millennium since the @entity6 arrived in @entity59 , the @entity3 is once again the center of global maritime trade , and a rising global power , @entity63 , is underwriting the modernization of @entity29 's ports for its gargantuan export volumes			1
@entity63 's so - called " string of pearls " strategy has been to develop maritime access points along the @entity3 from @entity70 and @entity71 to @entity29 and @entity72			1
one has to wonder : is @entity29 's location in the saddle of the " new maritime @entity75 " arcing from the @entity77 to the @entity78 a blessing or a curse ? trans - shipment hub if @entity63 is the new @entity6 or @entity83 , it covets @entity29 for its geography , not its cinnamon			1
the island represents an ideal trans - shipment hub for @entity63 goods branching off to @entity10 , the @entity89 such as @entity90 , @entity11 -- and of course : @entity92			2
in a world of maritime geopolitics , countries such as @entity94 and @entity29 emerge as strategic players whereas in the @entity98 they were sideshows			1
in this context , president @entity100 , like @entity72 's former president @entity101 or other @entity24 strongmen , knows how to " multi-align , " wooing outside powers and playing them off each other to minimize pressure on his regime for greater accountability			1
@entity109 now views @entity29 as increasingly strategic -- mostly because @entity63 does			1
the paradox of such competition is that it is precisely in the countries viewed as most strategic by multiple powers that one can least impose one 's values			2
@entity100 's regime is the new kingdom of @entity120 , inviting foreigners but attempting to control their influence			0
@entity56 involvement former colonial master @entity56 is a perfect example			0
against domestic opposition , @entity56 prime minister @entity125 attended the november 2013 @entity128 summit in @entity39 , where he made statements about human rights and even visited a @entity132 refugee camp in the northern @entity133			0
the trip contained staggering ironies			0
first , much of the funding for the @entity137 has come from the diaspora in @entity56 , thus fueling and prolonging the very civil war whose brutality @entity125 went to criticize			0
furthermore , @entity125 has recently presided over an increase in arms sales to the @entity100 government , including assault machine guns , pistols and ammunition , ostensibly intended for counter-piracy			0
but that is small change			0
just one week before @entity125 's visit , @entity29 signed $ 1.3 billion worth of investment projects with @entity63 , mainly to build @entity39 's new 700 - acre large port on reclaimed land in exchange for a 99 - year lease on 100 hectares of land to @entity158 @entity63 already built the port in the southern city of @entity161 -- which had been devastated by the 2004 tsunami originating near @entity163 -- and named it after president @entity100 himself			1
as with @entity72 , @entity63 appears to be @entity29 's best friend as well -- for now			1
human rights driving alongside the site of @entity39 's future port , you encounter the towering , austere @entity168 stupa erected on the site of an old @entity175 church , a warning to outsiders sailing in that @entity29 is a confident , sovereign nation			2
indeed , @entity29 and @entity70 have remarkable similarities as former @entity56 colonies overcoming decades of civil war through militant @entity168 regimes			2
just as @entity70 's military is fighting aggressively to subdue its many ethnic tribes on the country 's strategic borders , @entity29 continues a ruthless occupation and crackdown in the country 's @entity132 populated north , with continued widespread human rights violations			1
@entity29 's civil war was much more an ethnic than religious conflict , and while minority @entity194 still face difficulty getting jobs against the dominant @entity198 , the overall security improvement means a rapidly growing economic pie ( @entity29 's growth rate is holding steady at 7 % )			1
more than a few @entity39 natives of various backgrounds echoed relief that the government had finally dealt with the security situation " by the roots , " code for thoroughly and decisively			0
like the government itself , they prefer freedom to self - criticism			0
even villagers outside @entity39 , who used to pack up and sleep in the nearby jungle to avoid attacks by the @entity137 ( @entity137 ) , can now rest peacefully at home			0
like @entity218 , post-civil war @entity39 is undergoing a genuine architectural and cultural renaissance			0
@entity39 renaissance beautifully conserved @entity47 and @entity56 colonial buildings and officers ' homes are being restored into hotels , restaurants and shops			0
manicured laws and gardens and brimming with children at play , traditional weddings are held at the @entity232 designed @entity233 along the old @entity47 canal			0
the @entity236 area , once fenced off due to the constant @entity137 attacks and suicide bombings , is now buzzing with yuppies of all persuasions			0
as in @entity218 , mosques , churches and temples now thrive side - by - side			0
it is not only the ports that are getting a big boost from @entity63 , but most of the country 's highways and roads as well			2
even in a small country , there are few investments as significant to creating jobs and spreading growth and mobility as basic infrastructure			0
the travel time between any two cities in @entity29 has been cut by more than half , making it possible for visitors to explore more of the country in a single trip			2
the @entity168 monuments and caves of the " @entity267 " along with the @entity269 and @entity270 beaches ( to which whale and dolphin watchers flock ) represent a central and northwestern arc , while southern routes take one to the bustling second city of @entity276 , the nearby rustic seaside town of @entity277 and @entity278 , teeming with elephants and leopards			0
among the fastest growing excursions combine luscious jungle drives and stays at luxurious resorts in manicured tea plantations , the tea - lovers equivalent of a southern @entity287 vineyard tour			0
@entity29 's strategy is to leverage @entity63 and other investment to boost its own industries such as tourism , but also its main exports : textiles , garments and tea			1
but will it succeed in leveraging great power machinations for its own -- rather than foreign -- enrichment ? after all , it was n't just @entity2 colonizers who subjugated @entity29 's historical kingdoms			1
in 1411 -- almost a century before @entity6 's arrival to the region -- @entity305 kingdom ruler @entity304 refused to pay tribute and pledge obeisance to a visiting maritime force			1
as punishment , @entity305 was sacked and @entity310 and his family were shackled and sent off to bow before the emperor			0
the sailors were @entity314 and the 30,000 troops of his " treasure ships , " and the emperor was @entity318 of @entity319 @entity63			2

under @entity6 rule in the 15th @entity329 @entity29 became a crucial trading hub
@entity326 says it is again the center of maritime trade and a rising power
@entity29 is using its strategic *importance* to minimize pressure for accountability , he says
@entity63 investment is boosting @entity29 's basis infrastructure , @entity326 says
