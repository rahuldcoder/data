@entity0 -- aides to then - attorney general @entity3 improperly considered political affiliations and ideologies in hiring , but @entity3 was unaware of those actions , according to results of an investigation released monday by the @entity11 internal watchdog			1
the report cited @entity15 liaison @entity13 as the key operative behind many of the political moves			2
the report provides no indication criminal laws were violated but cites illegal civil actions involving discrimination in hiring			1
investigators , however , said no penalties are likely because the aides no longer work for the @entity11			0
@entity13 , the @entity15 liaison for the attorney general , was the key operative behind many of the politicized decisions involving career prosecutors and immigration judges , the report says			1
" the evidence demonstrated that @entity13 violated department policy and federal law and committed misconduct by considering political or ideological affiliations " in @entity11 appointments , the report says			2
investigators found @entity3 was oblivious to what @entity13 was doing			1
" when we interviewed him , @entity3 stated that he was not aware at the time that @entity13 used political factors in assessing candidates for career positions ... and was not even aware that @entity13 's portfolio in the office of attorney general included the hiring of immigration judges , " the report said			1
@entity54 ' attorney , @entity53 , issued a statement defending @entity3 ' lack of knowledge about the actions of his top aides			1
" it 's simply not possible for any @entity62 officer to be completely aware of and micromanage the activities of staffers , particularly where they do n't inform him of what 's going on , " @entity53 said			2
in a brief statement , @entity3 said , " political considerations should play no part in the hiring of career officials at the @entity11			1
" @entity13 , who resigned from the @entity11 last year , may have jeopardized her ability to practice law			0
an official close to the investigation says state bar associations have inquired about @entity13 's actions , and could choose to take away her law license			2
the report says in one case @entity13 discriminated against a female assistant @entity83 attorney on the basis of her sexual orientation			1
@entity13 's attorney , @entity86 , had no comment on the report			1
the 140 - page report represents the culmination of a yearlong investigation by the department 's inspector general and the @entity94 , which monitors the conduct of @entity11 attorneys			1
@entity3 was among 85 individuals interviewed by investigators , but @entity13 refused to be interviewed			1
@entity13 's only public comments were made in may 2007 before a @entity101 , which granted her immunity from potential prosecution			2
in her testimony , @entity13 admitted that some of her decisions " may have been influenced in part based on political considerations			0
" @entity109 , former chief of staff to @entity3 , also came in for criticism for considering politics in hiring , as did @entity13 's predecessors , @entity114 and @entity115 , who served as @entity15 liaison			1
@entity109 's attorney , @entity117 , said the report shows that in some cases @entity109 interceded to prevent political considerations			1
" with respect to ( selection of ) immigration judges , he believed in complete good faith that they were not career civil service positions and that political criteria could be taken into account , " @entity117 said			2
when @entity109 later learned he was incorrect , he supported correcting the process , he said			0
former top @entity15 official @entity130 received only a passing mention in the report			0
@entity109 noted @entity130 was a " supporter " of a particular candidate who applied for a position as an immigration judge			0
the only individual cited for misconduct who remains with the @entity11 is @entity139 , who told superiors @entity13 had not used political affiliation to select candidates when he knew that she had done so			0
@entity139 , who is currently detailed to @entity143 , could be subject to disciplinary action			0
attorney general @entity145 , who replaced @entity3 , promptly issued a statement saying he was " disturbed " by the findings , and vowed to ensure that " the conduct described in this report does not occur again at the department			1
" " it is crucial that the @entity83 people have confidence in the propriety of what we do and how we do it , and i will continue my efforts to make certain they can have such confidence , " @entity145 said			0
@entity161 leaders with oversight of the @entity11 said the report reflects widespread political excesses			0
" it is now clear that these politically rooted actions were widespread and could not have been done without at least the tacit approval of senior department officials , " said @entity166 chairman @entity165 , @entity167			0
@entity173 chairman @entity172 , @entity174 , said the report shows " systematic violations of federal law			2
" " the report also indicates that @entity13 , @entity109 , and @entity3 may have lied to the @entity179 about these matters			1
i have directed my staff to closely review this matter and to consider whether a criminal referral for perjury is needed , " @entity172 said			0
lawyers for @entity13 on monday issued a statement rejecting @entity172 ' assertion that she may have lied			2
" in light of ms. @entity13 's exceptional candor and cooperation , it is outrageous for @entity193 ... to suggest that she ' may have lied to the @entity179 , ' " the lawyers said			1
the legal team , led by @entity0 attorney @entity86 , noted @entity172 had twice thanked @entity13 when she concluded her testimony for " getting us closer to the truth of the serious matters we have been investigating			0
" the lawyers said @entity13 admitted in testimony that she " crossed the line " in considering political factors in hiring			0
@entity54 ' lawyer , @entity53 , similarly challenged @entity172 for his suggestion of possible perjury and , in a letter to him , demanded he " retract the suggestion			0
" the new report indicates its findings represent the second of four installments of the wide - ranging investigation of the politicization of the @entity11			0
the two remaining reports , expected later this year , will focus on hiring in the @entity215 and the results of the probe into the firing of several @entity83 attorneys .			0
