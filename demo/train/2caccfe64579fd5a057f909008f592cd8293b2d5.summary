the signs pointed to the grand jury drawing near a decision as to whether @entity3 police officer @entity3 will be charged with a crime for fatally shooting @entity5			1
but word leaked out saturday that when the @entity8 grand jury wrapped up its session friday , it had n't wrapped up the case			1
the 12 grand jurors will meet again monday , sources said			2
supporters of @entity5 's family want to see @entity3 go to trial			1
the officer 's supporters want him to be vindicated			0
business owners worry about their property			0
officials are concerned about keeping the peace			0
it 's still unclear when we will hear what the grand jury has decided			1
in the meantime , here are five things to ponder : 1			0
why were there expectations of a decision friday ? there were several indicators that something was going to happen last week			2
on monday , gov. @entity36 declared a state of emergency , citing the " possibility of expanded unrest			0
" he also ordered the @entity40 to send troops to the area			0
for weeks , the prosecutors ' office in @entity45 has said there likely would be a decision by mid-november			2
law enforcement officials briefed on the plans said wednesday the grand jury was going to meet friday for what might be its final session			1
on thursday , an email went out to all @entity45 employees detailing security preparations for a grand jury announcement			1
what does it mean that the grand jury is not done ? that 's hard to discern , but it 's not as if they have reached the deadline to decide			1
normally , a grand jury in @entity45 meets every wednesday			1
but the grand jury had been extended for the @entity5 case so jurors have extra time to hear from a number of witnesses and to focus solely on this case			1
in this scenario , the panel is allowed to meet on days when all 12 jurors can get together			1
once agreed upon , the schedule is given to the prosecuting attorney 's office			0
the law enforcement officials who told @entity80 of friday 's session also said @entity45 prosecutors were preparing to present more evidence to the grand jury before it started deliberating			1
what is taking the grand jury so long ? unlike in most grand jury presentations , @entity45 prosecuting attorney @entity87 has said he was going to present every piece of evidence and witness he has , much more information than is typically given			1
" absolutely nothing will be left out , so the grand jury is making their decision based upon absolutely everything , and we 'll go from there , " he told a @entity93 radio station in august			1
it is an unusual approach			0
" most times prosecutors decide , ' look , i want to get an indictment			0
i 'm going to present the minimum amount of testimony i need to get an indictment , ' " @entity80 senior legal analyst @entity107 has said			0
@entity87 told @entity80 's @entity108 that it had taken longer than expected to get some of the witnesses in front of the grand jury			1
the grand jury meets in secret , so it is impossible to know whether all the evidence has been presented and all the witnesses have testified			1
one possibility is the grand jury wanted to hear from a witness again			1
another scenario is that the grand jurors took a break before starting their deliberations			2
@entity87 has told @entity80 that if there is no indictment , he will seek to publicly release all evidence in the case			2
@entity128 , @entity45 's director of judicial administration , sent a statement to media on sunday that said that a judge must approve such a request and that the court will have to " analyze the need for maintaining secrecy of the records with the need for public disclosure of the records			0
what are the possible outcomes a grand jury could reach ? the grand jury is deciding whether @entity3 should be charged with any one of several possible crimes , including : first - degree murder , second - degree murder , voluntary manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter , said @entity149 , spokesman for the prosecuting attorney 's office			1
the grand jury can issue an indictment on any of those four charges , and it also has the option of adding a charge of armed criminal action , authorities said			1
at the same time , the grand jury will receive the @entity8 statutes for self - defense and the police use of deadly force			2
it may choose not to indict @entity3			2
once it has heard all testimony and reviewed the evidence , the grand jury determines whether there is probable cause a crime or crimes have been committed			1
if that is the case , a " true bill " is found and an indictment is issued			0
if no true bill is found , then there is no charge			0
nine of 12 grand jurors must agree that there is a true bill for the case to head to a trial hearing			2
but even in the case of a no true bill , prosecutors could theoretically present the evidence to a different grand jury			1
@entity190 legal analyst @entity189 said he thinks that is highly unlikely			0
whatever the decision , officials have said they will give notice to law enforcement and other authorities before publicly announcing the outcome			0
what do @entity3 residents say about the added wait ? it seems to be a mixture of frustration and confusion for @entity3 residents			1
" for me , it 's like i do n't understand what they are stretching it out for			0
maybe they do n't feel like they have enough evidence , i do n't know , " said @entity210			0
others think the grand jury had a pretty easy case			1
" honestly , i do n't think it should be a process			0
this man ( @entity3 ) should be locked up , " said @entity218 , who works in @entity3			2
" any civilian could have had 20 witnesses pointing at them , and he could have been locked up that day			0
i think this is crazy			0
" some people were guardedly ok with the news that grand jury would meet again			2
they said rushing through could lead to the wrong decision			0
@entity218 said many people he has talked to believe that @entity3 wo n't be indicted			2
" everybody is in shock that it 's taking this long			0
everybody is anticipating that he is going to get off , " he said .			0

grand jury has been solely focusing on @entity5 shooting
prosecutors have said deadline is january 7 , but decision likely before then
12 jurors have more evidence and testimony to weigh than in a normal case
@entity3 residents seems tired of waiting ; some hope lengthy process sign of thorough jury
