@entity0 -- @entity2 staggers onto the stage at @entity0 's @entity4 and squints into the darkness at the sell - out crowd			1
it 's the first paid gig in his short career as a stand - up comedian			1
the microphone stands in the spotlight in the centre of the stage but @entity2 does n't approach it			1
he does n't need to because he has no voice			2
under the stage name " @entity16 , " @entity2 is fast becoming the talk of the town			1
born with cerebral palsy he has been unable to speak since birth			1
off - stage he uses a somewhat cumbersome machine which resembles an electric typewriter to convert his words to speech			1
on stage he uses an @entity26 with a text - to - voice app. lost @entity16 thanks the audience for their warm welcome and adds : " i have n't felt this important since the doctors said i was going to be a special child			1
" encouraged by the laughter he continues , referring to his difficulty walking			0
" i know what you were thinking when i walked on			0
it 's ok i 'm used to it			2
" having apparently played on the sympathy of the audience he switches the joke			2
" you thought ' here comes another * * * * * * with an @entity26			1
' well i 'm not			0
i 'm a disabled * * * * * * with an @entity26 -- the difference being i paid for mine with my benefit [ welfare ] money			1
" do n't tell @entity49			0
he still thinks i can not walk , can barely see and have a problem with my bladder			0
unfortunately for those closest to the stage -- one of those facts is actually true			2
" he 's into his stride now and has the crowd on his side			2
" in case you were in any doubt i really am disabled			0
it 's not just really good acting and i 'm definitely not just in it for the parking space			2
" when i realized i would never be able to talk again i was speechless			0
" @entity2 continues , talking about his synthesized voice , a mature male @entity70 accent which he refers to as a " posh version of @entity72 " and demonstrates the limited alternatives he had to choose from including a woman 's voice , @entity77 accents and a @entity79 translation			1
but just when things are proceeding smoothly , disaster strikes and technology kicks him in the seat of his pants			0
after an uncomfortable silence @entity2 recovers with a little improvisation			1
" sorry ladies and gentlemen , my @entity26 has just crashed			1
where the * * * * is @entity88 when you need him ? " as the laughter continues he 's up and running once more			2
" i am not related to @entity91 in any way			0
however i do hate the way people take the * * * out of the way he speaks			0
i can really synthesize with him ! " people have often asked me why i want to put myself in a position where everyone can look and stare at me			0
the truth is that it happens to me every day any way			0
at least this way there 's a scheduled time and place for it			0
" he finishes his set with an account of his audition for @entity111 's " x-factor " with a dead - pan spoken - word version of " i believe i can fly " leaving the producers unsure how to handle him			1
with that he thanks his audience and lurches off the stage with loud cheers ringing in his ears			1
just as @entity2 thinks the night can not get any better he bumps into one of his heroes -- not a comedian but the manager of his favorite football team , @entity122			1
manager @entity123 is warm in his admiration			0
" let 's be honest -- it takes incredible bravery to do what he 's doing			1
more bravery than me or any of my players show to do what he 's trying to do			1
so all i can say is that i wish him all the best in a very tough business			0
our business is tough but his is tougher so i wish him all the best			0
" i suggest to @entity2 that his act creates a dilemma for audiences : in normal circumstances it would be offensive for people to laugh at someone 's disability but @entity144 invites his audience to laugh along with him at his own disability @entity2 begins typing and about a minute later his machine gives voice to his thoughts			1
" i 've also thought that any subject can be joked about if handled correctly			0
i think i can get away with more because it 's essentially about me			0
i 'd like to think the audience go away with a more positive view about disability			2
" the bookings have begun to roll in -- @entity2 has been hired to perform at the prestigious @entity155 , attended by many a talent booker in search of the next comedy breakthrough act .			2

born with cerebral palsy , @entity2 has been unable to speak since birth
on stage he uses an @entity26 with a text - to - voice app
the manager of @entity2 's favorite football team *praises* his bravery
@entity144 invites his audience to laugh along with him at his own disability
