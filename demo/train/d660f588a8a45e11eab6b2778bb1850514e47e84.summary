-- at this year 's @entity2 , the televisions will be bigger , the watches smarter and more attractive , and the homes and cars more connected			1
@entity2 , which kicks off next week in @entity6 , is a giant technology trade show that mixes dozens of major tech companies with hundreds of scrappy startups			1
the big names show off their most recent lines of gadgets alongside eye - catching prototypes of future devices that may or may not ever make it into stores			1
smaller companies fill booths with oddball gadgets and robots , plus more mundane fillers like phone accessories			1
here 's a peek at what to expect from 2014 's first big technology conference			2
a gadget for every limb there are devices to go on wrists , faces , waistbands and necks			2
wearable - technology makers will push even harder to make these small gadgets go mainstream after a year of mostly awkward and misguided offerings			1
the main focus has been on smartwatches , but so far products like @entity42 's @entity41 have combined only half - baked hardware and clunky designs			2
@entity45 is not yet available outside a select group of beta testers , but it already has something of a reputation problem			0
one area that has managed to find a profitable niche is fitness tech. @entity54 devices like the @entity55 keep it simple by tracking steps , calories and other workout stats , and by synching collected data to smartphones			0
fitness wearables overlap with health tech , with devices that track vital signs and help doctors monitor patients from far away			0
but it 's still unclear if companies will be able to transition sporty and geeky wearables into legitimately fashionable designs that will appeal to mainstream consumers			0
major tech companies at @entity2 can be particularly tone - deaf when it comes to appealing to women			1
( an area of the show floor dubbed " @entity77 " is an ominous sign			1
) the intelligent house it 's not enough for phones and wristwatches to be smart			2
some of the same technology that goes into wearable devices ( tiny sensors and low - power wireless connections ) is being used to make homes more connected as well			1
the promise of a smart home that saves energy and can be controlled from a phone has been around for several years , but the industry was still figuring out how to best make the various devices speak to each other			1
this year there will be even more vendors shilling home gadgets , but outside of home security systems -- a smart thermometer like @entity100 or a code lock -- it 's not clear whether regular consumers are itching to wire up their entire homes so that they can dim the lights from halfway around the world			1
the home - automation industry still has some issues to untangle before it connects with mainstream homeowners			2
conflicting communications standards , like @entity111 and @entity112 , are fighting for supremacy			0
a handful of major companies want to own the entire connected - home ecosystem , such as @entity117 's with its @entity119 system			2
other smaller companies such as @entity121 see a future where various bits and pieces of a home from different vendors can work together			2
tvs are still a thing televisions continue to be a dominant product at @entity2 , with major companies like @entity132 , @entity42 , @entity133 and @entity134 trying to make screens bigger , higher - resolution and splashier than ever before			1
there will be gimmicky and extremely costly features , like curved screens , and other new form factors that will appeal only to the most well - funded audio / visual fanatic			1
last year , @entity142 was the new ultra high - resolution buzzword , but the volume of @entity142 content continues to be minimal			0
( expect to see some new 4k compatible cameras and camcorders			0
) @entity148 gave the format a boost this year when it announced it is working on a way for the new devices to stream @entity142 content from services like @entity155 without gobbling up all the bandwidth			0
the new streaming format , called @entity158 , will be demonstrated by major tv manufacturers at @entity2			1
other tv trends will include oled screens , internet compatibility in the form of improved tv operating systems , and gesture controls			0
many tv companies have eased off of @entity168 televisions , which still have n't caught on despite years of hype			0
cars connect with smartphones driving and smartphones may not mix now , but car companies are still looking into ways to safely combine the two			0
@entity176 's annual auto show does n't take place until later in january , but the tech developments inside the cars will make an early appearance at @entity2			1
it takes much longer to design and produce a new car than it does a smartphone , tablet or computer			0
that means such in - car technology as dashboard computers often feel out of date as soon as they 're released			0
some car manufacturers are working around this issue by adding compatibility for @entity193 and @entity195 devices and including safe new ways to interact with the systems while keeping eyes on the road			0
cars are new territory for the smartphone operating - system battle , with @entity203 and @entity148 each angling for prime placement inside of popular car brands			0
for example , @entity207 is expected to announce next week a partnership with @entity148 to bring @entity195 systems to its cars			0
in - car information and entertainment systems are a minor feature when compared to what 's going on inside some vehicles			0
major car companies , universities and tech companies like @entity148 are all working on automated - driving features			2
fully self - driving cars are still a ways off , but early features that will let vehicles communicate with other cars , gather data about your driving patterns and take over in stop - and - go traffic are beginning to appear			2
the games people play @entity2 is not the biggest show for video - gaming news			1
the major console releases came out just ahead of the holiday rush , and game shows @entity238 and @entity239 do n't take place until later in the year			0
but some smaller gaming products will bring a bit of fun to @entity2 this year			1
mobile gaming is a huge market , so look for smartphone - and tablet - compatible accessories and controls , motion sensors and fun add - ons that communicate with your devices over @entity254			1
@entity257 's @entity256 gaming platform is expected to have a big presence at @entity2 , while cult darling @entity259 -- a virtual reality headset -- also will be on the floor			1
some tech that started with game systems , such as motion - controlled interfaces , will branch out into other devices .			0

the @entity2 show starts monday in @entity6
tvs will get bigger ( and curved ) , and will add more " smart " features
tiny sensors will lead to a boom in home and wearable gadgets
