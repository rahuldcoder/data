-- long before company celebrators bench - pressed fax machines , partygoers performed competitive face - plants into ice water , or family members gathered around an aluminum pole to wield complaints at one another , the common people of ancient @entity2 began to act up			1
they were the unruly lot during official religious holidays , the ones who were " raising hell on the streets " while the " elite were putting on their robes , " said journalist @entity19			2
the adverb to describe their behavior , he said : festivus , the @entity24 world for " festive			2
" a few thousand years later , and thanks to a " @entity30 " writer whose father had made @entity22 a quirky household tradition , a 1997 episode of the famed sitcom popularized the peculiar day			1
to hear it from @entity42 , the character played by @entity43 , the december 23 observance calls for little more than the erection of an aluminum pole , the airing of grievances and the demonstration of feats of strength -- which preferably culminate in wrestling down to the ground and pinning the head of the household			1
" people want something that 's nothing , " said @entity19 , author of " @entity22 : the holiday for the @entity48 , " a book that chronicles the birth and flourishing of this oddly sacred day			1
" all the traditional holidays exclude somebody , " but with this one , " everyone 's in on the joke			2
" show us how you celebrate @entity22 the @entity22 faithful have gathered across the globe and have come together in places as various as seedy bars , campus squares and corporate boardrooms			1
citizens , with varied degrees of success , have petitioned to raise @entity22 poles beside public nativity scenes			1
social networking sites and holiday - specific venues -- like festivusbook.com and @entity69 -- are go - to places for those who want to share the cheer , or jeers			2
for at least eight years , @entity73 , 35 , has been hosting @entity22 parties in the @entity76 , @entity77 , area			1
the graphic designer and illustrator said she was drawn to the holiday when her then - company department , which included people of various faiths , decided to trade in the traditional @entity84 for something more inclusive			2
" it went over well except for one person who thought it was blasphemous and tried to knock over our @entity22 pole , " she said			1
" he refused to come to the potluck , was forced to , came , ate all the food and left without saying thank you			0
grievances were aired about him			0
" at her parties , which happen when she feels like throwing them -- perfectly fine , according to @entity19 , because " there 's no pope of @entity22 ; you make up whatever rules you want " -- people jot down their grievances and stuff them in the pole			1
they complain about parking tickets , the economy and their spouses , she said			0
one of her favorites in recent years read like this : " what 's up with the dude in the white shoes ? it 's way after @entity116			0
" people exchange gifts they 've received and do n't want			0
dickies , random hair extensions and shoe - shining kits from the ' 70s are always appropriate , she said			0
and feats of strength generally involve thumb - wrestling ( costumes for thumbs included ) and timed competitions to see who can submerge their face in ice water the longest or hold 3 - pound weights to the side for the greatest stretch of time			1
" as the hostess , " @entity137 made clear , " i cheat			0
" getting in on the fun in recent years is a stairway railing company called @entity141 , based in @entity142 , @entity143			0
@entity144 , who heads sales and marketing , saw an article about @entity22 that @entity19 wrote in the @entity148 in 2004 , a precursor to his book , and thought cutting up pipes to make aluminum holiday poles would be an easy -- and fun -- side business			1
thus was born festivuspoles.com , an outfit that 's answered thousands of requests for the nonsectarian celebratory metal			0
@entity144 said he 's received orders from troops in @entity160 and people living in @entity162 , though he 's advised across - the - globe customers who can to simply stroll into their local hardware stores and ask for pieces of pipe			0
when the company sent @entity143 gov. @entity168 a @entity22 pole in 2005 , he put it up in the executive residence			2
today it appears in the state 's historical museum			0
@entity22 is n't the only wintertime holiday to be introduced to the masses by television			1
@entity181 's " @entity180 " brought us " @entity182 " in 2003 and continued the holiday throughout the teen drama series ' run			0
@entity182 was an answer to the winter holiday dilemma for interfaith families .			0
