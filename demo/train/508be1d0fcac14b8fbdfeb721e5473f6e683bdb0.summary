-- two years removed from his disastrous 2012 presidential bid , @entity1 is fully recovered from back surgery , sporting new glasses , reengaging with the @entity6 conservative base , and showing signs that he 's considering another run for the @entity9			1
immigration policy helped sink the @entity13 governor 's previous bid , but it has now put him back in the spotlight			1
he met on wednesday with president @entity15 , who 's under fire over the surge of undocumented minors on the southern border			1
@entity15 accepted @entity1 's offer for a sit - down following a sharp exchange with the @entity9			1
last week , @entity9 spokesman @entity23 mocked his message on immigration , saying " the truth is it 's hard to take seriously governor @entity1 's concerns			1
" @entity1 points to his state 's long border with @entity31 as ground zero for the crush of mostly children entering the @entity35 illegally			1
" my message to president @entity15 is to secure this border , mr. president			2
finally address this issue and secure this border , " @entity1 said last week at a congressional hearing near the border in @entity42 , @entity13			2
but he may have disappointed fellow conservatives when he said that he was " tired of pointing fingers and blaming people			0
" he added , " i hope what we can do is come up with some solutions here			0
" @entity1 used more muscular language days later when he said , " this is a failure of diplomacy			2
it is a failure of leadership from the administration in @entity57 " @entity58 , a senior @entity1 political adviser , told @entity0 that @entity1 " is not saying anything different than what he 's being advocating since 2010 -- that ' we 've got to secure this border			1
there 's a crisis going on			0
' " @entity15 wants $ 3.7 billion for immigration crisis but @entity58 said the current crisis is giving @entity1 a larger platform			1
" right now , because of the huge influx of these children crossing the border from @entity31 , the media 's paying more attention and more of the public is seeing the crisis the governor has been dealing with for years			0
not a lot has changed , but now more people are listening to what the governor 's saying , " @entity58 said			0
immigration helped sink @entity1 in 2012 while a real front - burner issue in his state , @entity1 is also seeing political stars align			1
immigration was the issue that damaged him more than any other when he ran for president last time , people close to him say			0
@entity1 launched his presidential campaign in august 2011 , months after former @entity91 gov. @entity90 and the rest of the field of candidates had jumped in			1
@entity1 entered with lots of buzz and armed with big bucks and big name backers , and he quickly soared in national polls			2
but good times were fleeting , as @entity1 soon ran headfirst into @entity90 on illegal immigration			1
in a debate a month later , @entity1 defended his support for government - funded tuition at state schools for undocumented immigrants			2
he argued that if you did n't support such a move , " i do n't think you have a heart			0
" but some of his @entity6 rivals considered that soft			2
" governor @entity1 , you say you have got the experience			2
it 's a bit like saying that , you know , the college coach that has lost 40 games in a row has the experience to go to the @entity122 , " said @entity90 at another debate			0
@entity1 's busy summer " the truth is , @entity124 -- i 'll say it again , @entity124 and @entity126 have both had no increase in illegal immigration and yours is up 60 percent			1
sources close to @entity1 tell @entity0 they believe that moment did more to hurt @entity1 with @entity6 primary voters than any other			1
still , @entity1 suffered a more memorable blow with an epic gaffe in a november 2011 debate , when he forgot the third of three federal government departments that he had said he would eliminate			2
@entity1 's campaign limped on , but he called it quits after a disappointing fourth in the @entity140 caucuses and fifth in the @entity142 primary			1
political resurrection ? fast forward two years			0
@entity1 decides not to run for re-election and is again making his pitch to conservative voters			1
" i have a simple suggestion -- it is time for a little rebellion on the battlefield of ideas , " @entity1 told the base at this year 's @entity149			1
and @entity1 's summer travel plans hint toward a 2016 bid			1
he recently made his third trip over the past year to @entity157 -- the state the holds the first southern primary			0
the visit to the @entity157 precedes upcoming stops this summer in @entity140 and @entity142			0
@entity1 even hosted a group of more than a dozen key @entity142 republicans at the @entity165 in @entity166 a few weeks ago to wine and dine them , @entity0 is told			2
when he goes to the @entity142 next month , it will be his first trip there since 2012 , when he failed to make much of an impression at all on voters there			0
a veteran @entity142 @entity6 ally setting up @entity142 meetings tells @entity0 they are consciously doing things differently this time			0
they 're opting for a manner more conducive to the way @entity142 voters like to be approached , in a series of small , intimate meetings			0
but the tactical shortcomings from 2012 is not the only thing he 's trying to improve ahead of another possible candidacy -- it 's also his readiness on a policy level			0
@entity1 urges @entity189 , @entity15 to work together on border security @entity1 sources admit that he simply was n't up to speed on many of the key issues that confront a candidate , never mind a president			1
to overcome that , he now has multiple policy briefings a week , every week on issues ranging from economic policy , to education , to the environment to national security			0
one source tells @entity0 that if he is traveling and there is a think tank nearby , he will make a point of stopping for a briefing from experts			0
@entity1 has also been trying to do more international travel , attending the highbrow annual @entity209 in @entity210 , @entity211 , going to @entity212 , and planning a trip later this year to @entity214			0
but it 's firestorm over immigration that may give @entity1 his biggest opportunity for political resurrection			1
@entity58 downplayed any impact from the current immigration crisis on a potential 2016 bid , saying " to me these are two completely separate issues			0
" but @entity6 analyst @entity223 , a @entity0 contributor who 's close to former @entity126 gov. @entity226 , another possible 2016 @entity6 presidential contender , said " @entity1 embodies an interesting dynamic regarding immigration			1
" he 's a border enforcement guy with the experience of being a border state governor , but he 's also shown compassion towards the human angle of the immigration debate , " she said			0
@entity233 added that " if he can somehow walk that tight rope , and be eloquent as to how he defends his position , it can show him as a pragmatist and be helpful			0
" reality check : 5 things you need to know about immigration crisis what @entity15 can and ca n't do on immigration @entity244 : undocumented			2

he is reengaging with the @entity6 's conservative base
immigration helped sink his 2012 presidential campaign
but it 's putting him back in the spotlight now with his @entity15 meeting
