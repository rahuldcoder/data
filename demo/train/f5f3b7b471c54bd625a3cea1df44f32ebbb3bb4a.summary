beijing -- thousands of passengers were stranded tuesday morning after dozens of early morning flights were either canceled or delayed due to a thick , dark cloud of smog that rolled through the @entity6 capital			1
the haze prompted 34 flight cancellations and delayed 98 others after visibility dropped to less than 200 meters in the airspace surrounding @entity13 , state media reported			1
air carriers resumed normal flight schedules as of 10 a.m. ( local ) , according to @entity16			2
but the city 's air quality continued to be listed as " fair			0
" the @entity20 embassy , which reports pollution levels on its @entity23 feed , said the accumulation of air particles was " beyond index " for most of the morning , which means the pollution exceeded the scale used to measure it			2
the @entity20 @entity19 and @entity6 officials use different systems to measure air pollution			0
the @entity20 @entity19 's air quality monitor includes smaller particles that are less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter			0
the @entity20 consulate general in @entity36 , @entity6 , explains that these smaller particles " are believed to pose the largest health risks " and " are small enough to get into the lungs and even the blood stream			0
" last month , @entity13 's @entity40 canceled more than 200 incoming and outgoing flights and delayed more than 125 others because of smog			1
analysts have blamed the thick haze on rapid urbanization and industrialization			1
@entity13 , for instance , burned some 27 million tons of coal in 2010 , according to state - run media			1
despite efforts to limit the number cars with an auto - plate lottery , it 's estimated that @entity13 now has over 5 million cars , up from about 3.5 million in 2008			2
pollution is more acute because of the sheer size of the city 's population ( 17 million ) and the rapid speed of its economic growth , experts say			0
