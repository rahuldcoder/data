@entity0 -- it is 100 years since @entity5 explorer captain @entity3 set off on his ill - fated journey to be the first man to reach the @entity8			1
now , for the first time , writings , photographs and items from the arduous @entity13 expedition , which lasted from 1910 to 1913 , have been brought together for public display			1
" it 's a story of immense heroism , " said curator @entity16 at the @entity17 in @entity18 , where the exhibition is taking place			1
entitled " these rough notes : captain @entity3 's @entity34 , " the exhibition includes fragile journals and letters written by the men who set out to traverse the @entity29 wastes , and features the last journal captain @entity3 ever wrote , as well as his final letter to his wife			1
it also includes pictures taken by photographer @entity38 , showing scenes of ice caves , frolicking penguins and the men relaxing at their camp , @entity44 , in preparation for the assault ahead			0
" he was one of the finest photographers of the 20th century , " said @entity16 of @entity38			0
" @entity3 realized that expeditions like this , just like today , run at a loss , so he realized that once he got to the @entity8 and back , he would have to give lecture tours , and would need photographic records , " she continued			1
also included in the exhibition are items from the company 's midwinter 's day festivities in june 1911 , which they celebrated in lieu of @entity60 with a big meal and a " tree " they decorated with little flags			2
on display are the paper hats they made for themselves as well as a menu one of the men fashioned in the shape of an adelie penguin			0
but it is the journals , letters and notebooks that tell the story best			0
" it 's a once - in - a - hundred - year opportunity to read this material and actually see the handwriting , " said archivist at the institute , @entity79			2
" a lot of it has been quoted , but actually seeing the handwriting and seeing how shaky their hands were from when the weather was so extreme , is slightly different from seeing a typed page , " she continued			0
a hand - produced newspaper by the so - called " @entity91 , " who were trapped for months in an ice - cave during a perilous geological expedition in 1911 , are blackened with soot from the blubber - burning stove the men used in order to stay warm			2
the final , tortuous journey to the @entity8 is also brought to life through the writings and photographs on display			1
" when they set off on november 1st with the ponies , the dogs and the motor sledges , it 's all very upbeat , they 're not setting out to die , they 're setting out to reach the @entity8 , hopefully to be the first but if not the first , then one of the first people to be there , " said @entity79			2
but the farewell letters from the last three men standing -- @entity3 , dr. @entity116 and @entity117 ( @entity118 ) @entity115 -- are written in the knowledge that they were dying and are , said @entity79 , " very personal			2
" heart - rending photographs of the team finding rival @entity125 explorer @entity123 's tent already at the @entity8 complement the written details of their arduous journey there -- and cast a shadow on their harrowing and ill - fated journey back			1
it is through their writing that we now know the story of captain @entity136 , one of the five men to reach the @entity8 , who suffered horribly from injury and frostbite on the way back and walked out into a blizzard in order to save his companions			1
" it 's an incredibly poignant story to walk out into a blizzard to try to save your companions and then to have them die too , " said @entity16			1
" for them to know they were dying and to sit there writing letters , it ca n't fail to make you emotionally involved , " she continued			0
@entity3 , @entity116 and @entity115 died of starvation and exposure in their tent in late march 1912			2
months later , a search party found them , along with their last letters and journals			0
@entity16 believes people remain fascinated by this tale of endurance because it involves extremes : of temperature , of effort and of emotion			0
but , she said , " the story is actually much better than fiction			0
it 's a tremendously heroic story , and it 's real			0
" @entity44 still stands today , preserved almost exactly as @entity3 and his men left it a century ago			1
you can visit it , but , @entity16 said , much like then , " it does rather depends on your wallet			0
