-- one long , brutal year has passed since the @entity2 people launched their revolution , demanding an end to the dictatorship of president @entity6			1
since then , the regime has killed at least 8,000 people , according to the @entity9 , and it has sent the rest of the world a quiet but blunt message : you are fools			0
@entity18 because much of the world fell for , and even participated in , @entity6 's manipulative , decade - long game in which he portrayed himself as a modernizer and reformer			1
but now we know what @entity6 really thought about reform			1
in his own , ultramodern shorthand : lol			0
from the day he came to power in 2000 , @entity6 , a @entity23 - educated ophthalmologist , has used the media and massaged the egos of politicians to put forth the fiction that he would bring freedom and openness to @entity2			1
but the charade started to come apart one year ago			0
if the massacres committed by @entity2 forces on his behalf had not provided enough proof that the image was all fake , a new trove of private e-mails confirms just how far @entity41 observers had missed the mark when they judged the lanky doctor - turned - dictator as one of the good guys			1
the @entity46 obtained 3,000 e-mails from private accounts used by the president , under the address sam@alshahba.com , and his wife , @entity51 , as ak@alshahba.com			1
the @entity46 says the e-mails , which were provided by a @entity2 opposition source , are verified as real by many of its correspondents			1
they confirm that @entity6 and his stylish , @entity59 - born wife are keenly tuned into the modern world			1
they shop extravagantly online and consume mass - market cultural fare such as @entity63 , " @entity64 " and country music			0
their e-mail discussions about shoes , jewelry , chandeliers and fondue pots , along with ideas about how to put down the uprising and how to spin the events for foreign audiences , occurred between june and february , as forces loyal to @entity6 slaughtered thousands of mostly unarmed protesters			1
in one e-mail , @entity6 laughs at democratic reforms			1
when his wife tells him she 'll come home early one day , he quips , " this is the best reform any country can have that u told me where will you be , we are going to adopt it instead of the rubbish laws of parties , elections , media ... " other e-mails show one of @entity6 's media advisers , @entity95 , whose father is @entity2 's @entity9 ambassador , helping arrange interviews with @entity100 networks such as @entity101 and dealing with @entity0			1
@entity102 joked with @entity103 , one of his media consultants , while @entity106 monitors were in @entity2 seeking to bring an end to the carnage			1
@entity102 ridiculed the mission , sending @entity110 a @entity112 parody of the violence that uses children 's toys			0
" check out this video , " he wrote			0
she responded with , " hahahahahahaha , @entity118 ! ! ! " if there is any hint that @entity6 has any misgivings about the human cost of his political survival , it comes in an e-mail that attaches an @entity129 download of a country song by @entity131 , with the lyrics written out for @entity51 : " i 've been a walking heartache / i 've made a mess of me / the person that i 've been lately / ai n't who i wan na be			1
" @entity102 and his wife have been deftly playing international public opinion from the beginning			0
a @entity137 article in april 2000 , a few weeks before he became president , describes him as " soft - spoken and congenial , a fan of @entity140 and @entity141 ... mapping his own path by trying to address the social and economic demands of the next generation			0
" two months later , the @entity146 explained that " thanks to an orchestrated campaign in the state news media to credit him with fighting corruption and promoting a more open economy , dr. @entity6 also is seen as a beacon of hope for a new , more relaxed @entity2			1
" the image held for years , even if the reforms never quite arrived			0
in 2005 , the @entity157 administration withdrew the @entity100 ambassador to @entity2 , and @entity160 countries froze relations with @entity162 for its role in the killing of former @entity166 prime minister @entity165			2
but the @entity168 administration and many in the @entity171 establishment and in @entity160 still believed that @entity6 was a closet reformer			2
as recently as april , secretary of state @entity173 said members of both parties " believe he 's a reformer			0
" and sen. @entity177 , who has met @entity6 about half a dozen times , said he expected that @entity6 would enact meaningful reforms			2
over the years , @entity6 's wife , @entity51 , cast a spell on the media			1
in february 2011 , @entity183 published a glowing spread about the fashionable first lady entitled " a @entity186 in the @entity187			0
" the article explained that " in @entity2 , power is hereditary " but called the @entity189 " wildly democratic			2
" @entity51 has always been key element of the propaganda effort			0
former @entity157 administration official @entity193 praised @entity6 , saying , " i think who a man marries says a good deal about him			2
" the first lady , he said , " is going to bring exposure to absolute world - class standards and practices in the globalized economy of the 21st century			0
" clearly , @entity6 and @entity202 are creatures of the modern world			1
they watch @entity112 videos , shop online and use secret e-mail pseudonyms			0
i bet they 're buying the latest @entity211			0
but those in the @entity41 who believed that their modernity meant they would bring democratic reform got it all wrong			2
what their experience in the @entity41 taught them was not a love of democracy and human rights			2
instead , it showed them how to manipulate the media and how to create an image that would let them rule by the old - fashioned ways of dictatorship : by imprisoning and killing opponents			2
anyone who believed otherwise was taken for a fool			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity236 .			0

the @entity46 obtained e-mails from private accounts of @entity6 and his wife
@entity242 : the e-mails reveal that the @entity2 president has been fooling the @entity41 all along
she says that despite @entity6 's embrace of *western* culture , he 's a dictator
@entity251 : couple are creatures of the modern world ; they know how to manipulate the media
