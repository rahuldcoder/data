-- i live my life in the open : i 'm easily googleable , emailable , and you can figure out from my @entity5 and @entity6 accounts what i 've been doing			1
for a while my phone number was posted publicly on my @entity10 profile			0
i 'm aware that these sites and services are tracking me			1
i know they 're collecting my data , crunching it and selling it to advertisers , who in turn try to sell me things , and i am ok with this			0
it 's the cost of admission			1
these services help me stay connected with my friends and interact with strangers , and in turn i grant them permission to analyze my tweets and profile my @entity10 interests for profit			1
the revelation that the government is snooping on our communications in the interest of national security is nothing new			1
this latest incident does n't come as a shocker			1
you might guess that i reacted with mild surprise followed by general indifference , because young people are already sharing everything anyway			1
besides , privacy is dead , right ? @entity47 is not dead			1
the phone snooping is on a different level than that of companies selling my data to advertisers			1
such behavior is unsettling , and is perhaps a true threat to privacy			2
there are some in @entity58 who regard privacy as a relic of the past , something that falls off the back of the truck of progress as it rumbles into the future			2
it reminds me of sci - fi author @entity68 's novel , " @entity73 , " in which entrepreneurs unleash nanobots that virtually overnight blanket the earth and create an internet - on - steroids instantly connecting everything on the planet , letting humans peer into any part of the world			2
the novel is a thought experiment on the obliteration of privacy , and @entity68 imagines dumpster - diving as routine â € ” everyone can peer into the trash can at @entity87 and find discarded but perfectly edible griddle cakes			2
@entity89 basically disappears as everyone knows where everyone else is and what they are doing			0
even clothing is a mere formality			0
but even in the book there are blind spots , places the nanobots ca n't reach			0
in our real world , privacy is n't anywhere close to dead			1
privacy today is just more nuanced and exists in different ways than 10 , 50 , 100 years ago			2
it is not simply a matter of sharing more or less ; not merely how much but in what way and with whom			0
privacy is contingent on who we 're trying to keep something private from -- family , friends , acquaintances , employers , strangers			1
with more services and apps and greater degrees of control in which we can use them , we find ourselves having to make more decisions about where to draw the lines			2
friends of mine will untag themselves from @entity10 photos to hide more unflattering images of themselves if they are " friends " with their employers			0
some refrain from posting to @entity10 things they do n't want their parents to see , opting for @entity5 instead , where their parents do n't have accounts			0
@entity135 is built around a privacy - minded constraint : @entity139 messages that self - destruct shortly after opening			2
the nature of social media also makes room for subterfuge , and an illusory openness is another form of privacy			0
the @entity148 allows for masks , false identities and misrepresentation			0
it 's prevalent enough in online dating , for instance , that @entity155 has a show devoted to it			0
there may be new spotlights illuminating our lives , but these lights also cast shadows , and these shadows become new places where we can hide ourselves from the world			0
the kind privacy that is becoming more of the norm is dependent on our ability to move freely among the myriad services and apps , and to opt in selectively , both in what we use and how we choose to use them			1
i 'm not about to disable all my accounts			0
but i do wonder if we 're heading into a future where we have to be constantly mindful of when our privacy might just slip through the cracks			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			1

@entity179 : i live my life in the open , i 'm ok with websites and services tracking me
