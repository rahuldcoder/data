@entity0 , @entity1 -- a large oil drilling platform arrived thursday at the @entity1 mine where 33 trapped miners are awaiting rescue			1
the oil platform is part of @entity9 , the third operation to drill to reach the miners			1
@entity1 mining officials have said they believe that drill will dig faster than the other drills currently at work			0
but they cautioned that the miners , trapped since august 5 , still may not be rescued until december			2
" this was the most beautiful morning of my life , " said @entity16 , the sister of one trapped miner			1
" it 's hope for the boys			1
let them build it and get it working quickly			0
" progress on the other two rescue operations was mixed , said @entity28 , an engineer overseeing the drilling			0
the drill being used in @entity31 -- a type usually used in mining operations -- reached a depth of 171 meters ( 187 yards ) thursday , 40 more meters ( about 44 yards ) since an update given by officials wednesday			0
the @entity38 drill , usually used to drill water bore holes , hit a snag at 268 meters ( 293 yards ) , @entity28 said , when it struck a reinforcement beam used in the mine 's operations			1
the men have been trapped for 36 days now , 2,300 feet under the earth			1
when rescuers first found them , the miners told officials they had survived for more than 17 days by sharing a jar of peaches and small amounts of tuna and mackerel that were in their shelter			2
officials were weighing how to best proceed after the problem with the @entity38 drill , but said the drill bit would have to be retrieved and replaced			0
" it was totally destroyed , " @entity28 explained			0
the @entity38 device -- which had been drilling for less time than @entity31 's drill , and had already surpassed its distance -- also had a problem wednesday with a cable malfunction			2
the drill is widening a hole already drilled into the mine			0
@entity28 said that once it begins drilling again , it could reach its target -- a workshop used by the miners -- within several days			1
then a larger drill could be used until the hole is wide enough so that the miners can be hoisted out , one at a time , in a small cage .			0
