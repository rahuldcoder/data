-- the most comprehensive cybersecurity legislation proposed by @entity2 , which sponsors say would have helped protect the government and industry from potentially devastating cyberattacks , was voted down in the @entity7 thursday			1
the @entity8 would have given the government the three legislative elements it needs to fend off cyberattacks , according to @entity11 , assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism			1
those are new threat - information - sharing between the government and private industry , better protection of critical infrastructure such as the power grid and water filtration facilities , and authority for the @entity24 to unite federal resources to lead the government 's cybersecurity team			2
sens. @entity28 , i - @entity30 , and @entity31 , @entity32 , introduced the bill			1
" this is a moment of disappointment that i really can not conceal , " @entity28 said after the vote			1
" but the threat of cyberattack is so real , so urgent and so clearly growing that i am not going to be petulant about this			0
" on a telephone conference all with reporters wednesday , @entity11 and with other administration officials urged @entity2 to pass the bill			2
" the risks to our nation are real and immediate , " @entity11 said , adding that the @entity44 did n't see the legislation as a partisan issue , but rather a matter of national security			0
republicans opposed to the bill argued that the cybersecurity standards that would have been put in place allow for too much government regulation			1
" how can the @entity7 ignore these repeated warnings from the experts of how at risk our national security , our economic prosperity , and indeed our @entity65 way of life it is , " @entity57 asked			0
" it just is incomprehensible to me that we would not proceed to this bill			0
there certainly is plenty of blame to go around			0
" @entity2 begins its august recess friday , making it very unlikely that cybersecurity legislation will be voted on again before next year .			0
