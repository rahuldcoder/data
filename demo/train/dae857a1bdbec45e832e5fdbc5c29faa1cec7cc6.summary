-- people love to be the first person to do something			1
look no further than those annoying posts on blogs and online news stories where someone simply writes , " first ! " because they 're celebrating being the first person to comment			1
or watch any news program and see how they will report the detail of any minor celebrity in the off chance that it leads to a bigger , more exciting story			1
then they can run ads that say , " we were the first news team to bring you the story of @entity23 's new puppy			1
" now , imagine if you could get paid to be that cool , hip person who gets try products and services before anyone else ? when everyone else is claiming to have discovered this awesome new technology gadget , you can say , " oh , that ? yeah , i tried it out months ago			1
" with that pioneering ( and braggart ) spirit in mind , we put together a list of five jobs that let you try new things before they hit the market			1

but someone has to try new video games and look for flaws or glitches so programmers and designers can fix them before the release date			2
consider how complicated today 's video games are -- you 're immersed in an interactive world that has come a long way from the 2 - @entity70 world of @entity71 and @entity72			2
there are bound to be items that are overlooked , like a door that leads to nowhere or a secret code that does n't do what it 's supposed to			2

ice cream tester if you thought testing video games was fun , consider the sheer joy of getting paid to try ice cream			0
before you pick up a pint of a new , exotic flavor at the grocery store , someone had to make sure it was edible			0
for every whacky flavor like bubble gum , some food scientists tried out less successful flavors like spaghetti or pumpkin - wheatgrass			0
