-- assessment tests seem to be everywhere , measuring everything from intelligence to personality , ability , leadership potential -- you name it , they test it			1
but , how effective are these tests really at predicting job success ? " it 's a bit like rolling a dice , but if done right it 's better than nothing , " says @entity12 , author of @entity13			1
" this is an industry worth hundreds of millions of dollars , and not all these tests are equally good			1
the best way to gauge the result is to watch carefully what happens with your hires			0
" that 's what they 've been doing at @entity30 , the world 's largest shipping company , for nearly four decades			1
the company has been using and developing their own intelligence test , the content of which is considered so valuable a trade secret that it is done only in - house and on paper			1
@entity39 , senior director of group human resources , says the test helps minimize the uncertainty of the recruitment process			0
one key part of the test is analyzing intellect			0
" internal tests and academia tell us that all things being equal , the more intelligent you are the more likelihood there is that you will perform			1
in this case , smarter is better , " she says			0
with more than 100,000 employees in 130 countries and tens of thousands of applications annually , it 's also a purely practical approach - and one she says keeps paying off			0
" i can go fishing in our pool of talent , knowing that any of our recruits have the cognitive ability to rise through the ranks			0
" @entity30 's findings are in line with what most experts say -- that intelligence tests are fairly good at predicting people 's performance across a range of jobs			1
but , they also agree that they are not the only answer			0
@entity81 , one of the world 's foremost experts on developing talent and leadership , and author of several books on the subject , says iq tests can be notoriously problematic - especially when identifying leadership ability			1
" would having an iq score a few points higher predict greater leadership potential ? there is no evidence to support that claim , " he says			1
personality profiling can help give you insights into someone 's leadership style , how they will interact with others , and where improvement might be needed			2
@entity39 agrees , saying @entity30 's success has in part been due to combining their intelligence test with a personality test			1
" what we see is that any given personality trait may express itself quite differently			0
an assertive @entity114 and an assertive @entity115 may express themselves differently , but their performances are equally valuable			0
by using a test we can avoid the bias that come with certain judgments and expectations , and because we hire people from all over the world that is important			2
" most experts agree a proper combination of tests can supply you a greater understanding of how to motivate employees , fit them in the right jobs , and enhance their performance -- saving potentially millions of dollars in wrong hires and absenteeism			1
they also agree that the road to successful employee assessment is full of problems and potentially costly pitfalls			2
to get it right demands serious attention and commitment			0
@entity140 , chartered occupational psychologist at the institute of work psychology , @entity141 , says not all personality tests are created equal			1
" check whether the test has been shown in other organizations to predict performance -- in the same type of job you are trying to fill			2
" then , make sure the test takes into account the skills and personalities the job requires			0
that means doing a proper job analysis before you begin			0
" do n't just base it on the style of people doing it now , " he says , " but on what the job truly requires			2
" " remember that jobs have personalities too " , says @entity164 , president of @entity165 ( @entity165 ) , @entity166 , who are behind the personality test @entity30 uses			1
" the demands of a bookkeeper in @entity115 would be broadly similar to that of a bookkeeper in @entity175 - and the personality you are looking for in that case is someone who is conscientious , detail oriented , trustworthy and likes to work within a strong set of guidelines or and rules			1
" on the other hand , he adds , the job of a country president has a personality too			0
" it needs a person that can take overview , make decisions , manage risk , deal with complexity , motivate and mobilize people to achieve goals			2
" make sure you balance any type of assessment against other information like performance , observation , and feedback such as references - because they do n't always tell the whole story			2
" within limits , most of us can operate very effectively in ways that are not within our preferred personality , " says @entity140 , noting that an extrovert can be perfectly capable of behaving calmly when appropriate			0
also , remember that no test is foolproof			0
" experiments have shown that people can effectively fake personality tests when they want to , " says @entity140			1
he says they may guess what an employer wants in order to get the job - a bad idea that can land both employee and employer in a bad situation			0
ultimately , most experts agree that careful selection can pay off -- but only if done right			2
with decades of practical experience behind them , even @entity30 knows there are no guarantees when predicting behavior			1
" it 's a game of probability , " says @entity39 .			0

assessment tests are everywhere -- measuring everything from intelligence to leadership potential
some companies -- like shipping giant @entity30 -- say their tests help deliver a strong workforce
however , some people still *question* how well such tests can work
