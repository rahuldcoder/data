-- @entity1 just wanted to hold his 13 - year - old daughter 's hand again			1
the nine - hour operation completed on monday was the first double hand transplant in the @entity6			1
the 57 - year - old @entity7 , @entity8 , resident underwent the first double hand transplant in the @entity6 on monday at the @entity10			1
on friday he remained at the transplant intensive care unit			2
he is " very stable , awake and alert , and he 's talking with us , " said dr. @entity15 @entity14 , who led the nine - hour surgery			0
" he is having good circulation in the transplanted hands			2
" @entity1 shows no signs of transplant rejection , @entity14 said			1
the patient was groggy , but asked more questions about the operation as he started feeling better , said his wife , @entity24			0
he is expected to remain in the intensive care unit for a week , said @entity14 , chief of the division of plastic surgery and professor of surgery and orthopedic surgery at the @entity10			0
in 1999 , @entity1 lost both hands and feet to a strep infection			1
as the bacterial infection spread throughout his body , it stopped blood flow to his limbs and shut down his liver and kidneys			2
while most strep infections are mild , in some cases the bacteria can destroy muscles , fat and skin tissue and cause toxic shock syndrome			2
at the time , @entity1 's daughter was only 3 years old			1
" she does n't remember her dad any other way but this			0
we looked through pictures and we ca n't find one of him holding her hand			2
that 's one thing she was looking forward to -- that she 's going to be able to hold her dad 's hand again			2
" the infection came at a time when @entity1 had just earned a degree in pastry arts			1
" he was a good cook all the way around			0
i worked full time , " his wife said			0
" i was spoiled , because when i came home dinner was on the table			0
he did it very well			0
" for the last decade , @entity1 adjusted to prosthetic limbs			1
he drove his teenage daughter , @entity71 , to school and worked part - time at @entity75 bookstore			0
but he could no longer cook			0
although he could do some of the basic tasks , @entity1 said her husband could not perform activites that required fine motor skills			1
she had to help him in the shower and help him get dressed			0
" he would be on my schedule , that 's why this [ the hand transplant ] would give him a whole level of independence , " she said			1
with his new hands , @entity1 hopes to perform small tasks such as changing a light bulb and using a remote control			1
" i 'm looking forward to his cooking , " his wife said			0
" i 'm looking forward to him doing the things he wants to do when he wants to do them			0
" @entity1 initially had doubts , especially since it was an elective procedure			1
" the two points that changed his mind as we talked was , no. 1 , the independence he wanted to gain , " his wife said			0
the second point was that they believed there were fewer risks with this particular surgery			0
the @entity111 knew a double hand transplant meant @entity1 would have to take drugs to suppress his immune system for the rest of his life ( like any transplant , the recipient 's immune system could attack the new organ as a foreign object )			1
but for this surgery , the @entity123 doctors would also transplant bone marrow from the donor to reduce the amount of immunosuppressants @entity1 would have to take			1
according to the doctors , the bone marrow cells could re-educate the immune system so it would n't reject the hands			2
despite the risks , @entity14 said hand transplant recipients regain much of their autonomy			1
" they can perform activities of daily living -- the simple things you and i take for granted such as personal hygiene , brushing our teeth , combing our hair , " @entity14 said			0
" when you do n't have either hand , you are often completely dependent on another person , a family member or in mr. @entity1 's case his wife , for a lot of very basic activities during the day			1
" on january 22 , @entity1 signed up to be a candidate for the medical center 's clinical trial for hand transplants			1
he had to pass a screening process , which included a physical and a psychiatric evaluation of his coping skills , his expectations and his understanding of the transplant			2
three months later , @entity1 received the call			1
there was a donor whose hands matched @entity1 's skin color , gender and size			1
after getting permission from the donor 's family , the surgeons removed the donor 's hands extending midway to the elbows			2
a team of surgeons attached arteries and veins , repaired tendons and nerves and set the bones for both hands			0
the surgery involved 27 bones , 28 muscles , three major nerves , two major arteries , multiple tendons , veins and soft tissue			0
@entity1 still can not feel with his new hands , @entity14 said			1
" we really do n't expect him to [ now ] , " @entity14 said			0
" the nerves grow at a speed of one inch per month , and there are many inches between the mid-forearm to the fingers			0
" after @entity1 leaves the intensive care unit , he is expected to begin three months of physical therapy to gain mobility in his joints , wrists and fingers			2
" based on the results of hand transplants performed so far around the world , just about everyone regains protective sensation , which is the ability to distinguish between hot and cold and feel a pin prick , " @entity14 said			0
while it 's difficult to predict how much movement and sense of touch @entity1 will have in his new hands , @entity14 said , " we are optimistic he will regain protective sensation and even more than that			1
" more than 32 patients have received hand transplants			2
some of these recipients in the @entity6 and @entity223 have lived with their new hands for more than a decade .			0
