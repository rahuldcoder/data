-- you could say that a simple pair of running shorts was the trigger that launched a multimillion - dollar business and radically shifted the lives of basketball coaches @entity8 and @entity9			1
in august 2007 , @entity8 , who was then the head women 's basketball coach at the @entity12 , and her assistant , @entity9 , had just finished a long day teaching at a summer basketball camp			1
they sat exhausted in the gym , looking forward to a good night 's rest			0
then @entity8 -- thinking about her comfy running shorts -- experienced what she describes as an " aha moment			1
" " i looked at @entity9 and said , ' i love this fabric , and i 'd love to have bedsheets from this stuff			2
' @entity9 said , ' let 's do it			2
' " and with zero formal business experience , the two women stepped boldly into the world of entrepreneurship			0
they paired with @entity12 's @entity31 to research the market , quit their coaching jobs , formed a business and took their battles from the basketball court to business boardrooms			1
" the biggest similarity between coaching and what we do now is raising capital , " said @entity8 , who took @entity12 's women roundballers to the @entity39 for the first time in 2002			1
she compares raising capital to recruiting players			1
instead of selling the school basketball program , they 're selling bedding -- heavy on the marketing side -- complete with @entity53 presentations and glossy poster boards			0
their business -- @entity56 -- makes and sells " performance " sheets and pillowcases made from specialty fabrics that wick moisture and transfer heat			0
they sell online and at upscale sporting goods stores , trendy home stores and other retail outlets			0
after working together as coach and assistant coach for five years -- and now as business partners -- the duo has developed a kind of unwritten playbook for themselves			2
" we 're great friends , and we have different strengths , " @entity8 said			2
" @entity8 and i complement each other really well during presentations , " @entity9 said			1
" if i get stuck , she fills in , and if she gets stuck , i fill in			0
" crisscrossing the country to build their business team and garner support , the two often find themselves working together for 16 - hour days , said @entity9 , who gained attention as an @entity85 point guard on the @entity87 's national championship team in 1996			1
local media nicknamed @entity9 and a teammate " fire and ice			2
" " i look at this team in a similar way , " @entity9 said			1
" i bring a more ' fiery ' personality to our team , where @entity8 brings a calmer one			1
" meetings are very calm they say			0
the fire and ice come while grinding through everyday decisions			0
@entity9 proved on the basketball courts of the @entity102 that she can play with fire			1
in a 2002 altercation that 's ranked by @entity105 as one of the " most outrageous moments in sports , " a player with the @entity109 hit @entity9 in the face with the ball , prompting @entity9 to charge toward the player , who then knocked her to the floor			1
both players were suspended and fined " a couple thousand dollars , " @entity9 said			2
recently , during meetings for @entity56 , the fight has come up in business conversation several times			2
" i am amazed how many guys see the fight after we meet with them and then comment on it during the next meeting or in a follow - up e-mail , " @entity9 said			1
" they think it 's cool			0
" " i just smile and tell my side of the story , " she said			0
eventually , @entity9 learned to channel and focus that intensity , her former boss said			2
" @entity9 is n't emotionally popping off in a meeting like she was on the basketball court , " @entity8 said			1
" she was such an emotional basketball player , and it was one of the reasons why she was highly successful			0
but with this , everything is about preparation and running our team			0
" do they fight amongst themselves ? " oh , we fight all the time , " @entity8 said with a laugh			1
" we fight about business decisions and the pace of our business			2
i want to research everything			0
" sometimes , she said , when they realize they ca n't resolve their differences , they just put them aside and move on			0
do they see any parallels between male - dominated college and professional sports , and competing in the male - dominated business world ? not really , they say			1
" in sports , there are constant reminders that you 're not the same , " @entity8 said			1
she mentioned gender - based differences in " practice times , modes of transportation , facilities -- you live that every day			1
" but in the business world , she said , they 're " competing in an arena today where that 's not the case			0
it 's truly about the bottom line			1
" the two say they do n't have time anymore to shoot baskets or even talk basketball			0
it 's all business as they prepare for a major retail launch at upscale department stores and sporting goods stores			0
" what we 're doing is trying to change the face of bedding in the world , " @entity9 said			2
" what we want to do is win a ' national championship ' with @entity56			0
" now that they 're playing ball with business barons , do @entity9 and @entity8 miss their days on the hardwood ? " i miss some of the players who will really go to the wall for you , " @entity8 said			1
" i miss the strategy of the game			0
every once in a while , i 'll see a game on tv and i 'll see something that pulls me back there			0

*ex-college* , @entity102 guard @entity9 , *ex-head* coach @entity8 team up for business
" the biggest similarity between coaching and what we do now is raising capital , " @entity8 says
@entity9 often is asked about 2002 suspension , fine after fight on the court
they say sports has gender - based differences , but bottom line matters most in business
