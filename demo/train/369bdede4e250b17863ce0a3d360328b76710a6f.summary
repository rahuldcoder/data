-- you do n't have to be a motorcycle enthusiast to be wowed by the custom bikes created by @entity4 and his sons as seen on the @entity7 's " @entity6 " for a decade and now airing on @entity9 's " @entity8			1
" @entity4 , or " senior " as he 's called , left the @entity11 and eventually opened his first business , called " @entity13 , " according to the @entity8 website			1
after he grew his welding shop into a 30 - employee business called " @entity17 , " his passion for customizing motorcycles grew in leaps and bounds			2
but a constant companion on @entity10 's ride was alcohol			1
" back in the day , i kinda started early drinking and getting high , " he says			2
" if drinking was in the @entity26 , i would have been a gold medalist			2
" but he also says he thought he would grow out of what he now recognizes as addiction			2
" what it does is it gets progressively worse , and i think that i finally got to the point where it kinda just took over my life completely , " he says			1
@entity4 says there 's a long history of alcoholism in his family : " my uncle was an alcoholic , my mother was an alcoholic			1
and you know -- most of them died from that			2
" eventually , he realized everything he had built was at risk if things did n't change			2
" i was fortunate -- in 1985 , i was running a business , i had a small wielding shop , and i just got lucky , " he says			0
i went to a 12 - step program and then i just kept going			0
" just because he stopped drinking , however , did n't mean his buddies did			0
" it 's tough when you 're not drinking and you 've got two people on either side of you in a truck knocking down shots of @entity62 ( whiskey ) and drinking beers and you 're in the middle			0
" it was n't easy , he says			0
for nine years straight , he was afraid to miss a meeting			1
" it did take me two years before i was n't thirsty anymore			1
" he says he does n't go to meetings these days and that he never feels like drinking			0
but @entity4 says given his past experience , he will not drink again			1
@entity10 just celebrated 29 years of sobriety , which he describes as " quite the trip			1
" " when you get sober , you put things in play and they happen , " he says			1
" you think a lot clearer			0
your whole attitude changes , you kinda learn how to live all over again , which is a tough thing by itself			0
" and it 's a message he continues to share			0
" my life 's an open book , " says @entity4			1
" i know people that had problems and i think that i 've been a power of example to them			0
i 've heard from people that they 've turned their lives around from me sharing my experience , so it 's all good			0
i do n't have a problem with sharing anything			0
