-- in an interview with @entity3 , @entity1 has admitted using performance - enhancing drugs while cycling			1
he 's already been stripped of his seven @entity6 titles and this week had to give back his @entity8 bronze medal			0
but he still must face judgment from a different group of fans : those who have personal experience with cancer			2
@entity1 , founder of the cancer charity livestrong and a survivor of testicular cancer , is still a hero to some cancer survivors			1
but others express a mix of emotions and are trying to distance their support of his cancer efforts from their anger about his cheating			1
what did you think of the interview ? @entity29 , 64 , of @entity30 , @entity31 , said he was surprised that the disgraced cyclist appeared , in his view , " honest but insincere " in his apology in the interview , as if " whatever he was admitting was for his own benefit			0
" but @entity38 does n't hold that , or the doping , against @entity1			2
in @entity38 's mind , @entity1 is still a winner			2
" really , compared to the life and death issues of cancer that @entity1 has embraced , cheating in the @entity6 is small potatoes , " @entity29 said in an e-mail			1
@entity29 , who cycles as a hobby , has worn a @entity53 wristband every day since 2004 , even at business meetings			2
he sent an @entity55 to @entity0 about it , too			0
he had known @entity1 only in the context of cycling before getting a wristband at a 100 - mile bike ride in @entity60 , which prompted him to research @entity1 's battle with cancer			1
at that time , he saw the wristband as a symbol of " @entity1 's total victory over adversity			2
" " when i would be exhausted trying to keep up with the pace line , i 'd look down at that yellow band and get my second wind , " @entity29 said			0
the wristband took on a different meaning when @entity29 developed a cancerous tumor at the base of his tongue in 2009			0
then , the wristband became an inspiration for him to overcome the illness			2
" every time the treatments became intolerable , and i felt like my life was over , i 'd see that yellow band and it gave me hope that i too would be back on my bike , " @entity29 said			0
@entity38 's last treatment was in september 2009 , and he has been in remission ever since			0
these days , he still cycles about 2,000 miles a year			0
@entity1 's cheating in cycling also has n't tarnished his image as a source of inspiration for @entity87 , who found out she had breast cancer at age 29			1
she feels grateful for all that @entity1 has done for the cancer community , and appreciates that @entity53 had offered to help her pay for egg preservation because cancer and treatment for it could have impaired her fertility			1
( she ended up not doing the preservation , but is glad she had the option			0
) " i think we should accept his apology and move ( on ) because what he has done to help people with cancer definitely out weighs the ' bad			2
' he did n't give up when he was ( stared ) in the face with cancer , " @entity87 said of @entity1			1
" he kept going and encouraged many other survivors to the same			0
" breast cancer awareness : not so pretty pink other cancer survivors , however , are n't so quick to forgive			1
@entity111 , 49 , a two - time cancer survivor who also lost his brother to leukemia , said in an e-mail that he does not believe @entity1 is " an evil man , " but in a comment on a recent @entity0 story he harshly criticized @entity1 's behavior : " we can not deny he raised a lot of awareness and money for cancer			1
as a survivor i commend that , " @entity111 wrote			0
" unfortunately , he undid everything , in many ways , by his sociopathic need to bully , win , play mind games , and he used cancer as a cloak to cover his sins			0
if he 'd confessed ages ago in true remorse ? we 're a pretty forgiving people			0
but this is a forced , ' i still want to compete in something so i better apologize ' thing			0
" @entity0 user " jackiero " had an even more scathing view of @entity1 , posted in the comments on a recent story : " as an avid cyclist and a cancer survivor who used cycling to aid in my recovery , i am disgusted by this man , " jackiero wrote			1
" i threw away all my ( @entity53 ) gear not because i do n't support the cure -- of course i do -- but because i support the cure without the taint of a cheater like @entity1			1
he was an inspiration until i learned that he was just like all the other chemically induced sports stars who rake in millions and millions			0
" @entity53 likely to survive @entity1 doping admission @entity159 , 64 , of @entity160 , @entity161 , near @entity162 , is also dealing with his mixed feelings about @entity53 and @entity1			1
@entity159 has worn his two @entity53 bracelets , one for each time he had cancer , every day since his second surgery in 2006			1
he gives livestrong cancer guidebooks to patients he meets who have been newly diagnosed , but has separated his feelings about the foundation from @entity1			1
" when people ask me about @entity1 , i try to leave him out of the conversation if i can discuss @entity53 in the answer , " he said in an e-mail			1
" for me , the last year has been all about the foundation			0
" @entity1 's actions have also changed the way some family members of cancer survivors view him			1
@entity182 of @entity183 , who submitted an @entity55 about her family , still supports @entity53 , but has a cynical view toward @entity1			1
@entity182 ' family contacted @entity53 after her late husband , @entity187 , found out he had a brain tumor , and she said the staff there was very responsive			2
@entity187 was a big fan of @entity1 , and the @entity191 used the cyclist as a way of explaining to her children , who were 12 and 17 , that it 's possible to recover from cancer and accomplish many things			1
" you look for role models , you look for people that help get you through things , and i would say @entity1 did that , " she said friday			2
@entity1 is less of a role model now , she said , because he lied about what he did to get ahead in cycling			2
the @entity53 bracelets , she believes , are " tainted " by @entity1			1
he affected people " in a way that is far more significant than a bike race , " she said			0
" it 's about life and death			0
i do n't know if he will ever be able to say he 's really sorry			0
" @entity0 's @entity216 and @entity217 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 is still an inspiration for some cancer survivors
others are angry at @entity1 but still support his livestrong foundation
some say @entity53 wristbands are " tainted " by @entity1
