-- the events unfolding off the coast of @entity3 are both tragic and shocking			0
more than a hundred people are confirmed dead and the death toll is almost certain to rise dramatically			2
although it may be awful , sadly this is neither an unusual nor unfamiliar story			0
according to the @entity10 , in 2012 , some 15,000 migrants and asylum - seekers reached @entity11 and @entity12 and almost 500 people were reported dead or missing at sea			2
the figures are damning and shameful			0
too many people are dying in their attempts to reach safety in @entity19 and much more needs to be done to address the root causes of why people risk their lives in this way			1
one thing is clear -- this latest incident is an appalling reminder of what happens when people escaping persecution are denied access to safety at the @entity33 's frontiers			1
while we do n't know the personal circumstances of everyone on board this particular boat , we do know that the majority were from @entity40 and @entity41 , two of the top 10 sources of refugees in the world , according to the @entity10			2
both are countries with well documented human rights abuses			1
given this , it 's reasonable to believe that a number of people on board were refugees , fleeing persecution and seeking safety in @entity19 where there are substantial and settled @entity40 and @entity41 communities			1
yet there 's been considerable head scratching in the media about why people would put themselves at such risk			2
why would you get on an overcrowded , potentially unseaworthy vessel and risk your life to make it to @entity3 ? for refugees , the answer is simple -- what they 're leaving behind is much , much worse			0
@entity40 and @entity41 's human rights abuses are well documented			1
sexual violence and torture are commonplace			0
for refugees , staying at home -- or ' going back to where they came from ' -- is not an option			0
difficult though it may be for us to comprehend , for refugees , paying smugglers and boarding these boats is a rational decision			0
the problem is compounded by the lack of safe , legal routes into @entity19			1
the @entity86 -- a legal framework which defines who refugees are , their rights and the legal obligations of countries -- recognizes that people fleeing for their lives may have to resort to illegal entry			1
this drives refugees to take even greater risks to escape			0
@entity19 countries have a legal obligation to provide protection under the @entity86 but during the last decade the continent 's borders have become heavily securitized , with millions of pounds invested in @entity102 , the agency established by the @entity33 to strengthen @entity19 's borders and protect the continent against unwanted illegal migrants			1
these measures should not apply to individuals escaping war and persecution -- the theoretical beneficiaries of legally sanctioned protection and compassion -- but refugees are often forced to resort to the same irregular channels to leave their country of origin and travel towards safety			1
@entity19 's formidable migration control apparatus does not sufficiently differentiate between individuals who may be in need of international protection and other migrants			2
in the absence of safe , legal ways to reach @entity19 territories , refugees are forced into dangerous and abusive situations , and often obliged to embrace the perils of life - threatening journeys and the unscrupulous services of smugglers			1
boarding an overcrowded boat bound for @entity11 would possibly have been the last stage in a long and dangerous journey for many of those on that voyage			0
some of them possibly did n't even know where they were headed			0
@entity19 governments must work in solidarity to ensure people fleeing human rights violations and persecution are given entry			1
when people are in need of our help , we must live up to our international obligations and offer it			0
only then can we be sure we are doing all we can to prevent more deaths			0
we must keep a door to safety open for refugees and develop ways of identifying those with protection needs among the broader flow of migrants			1
as yesterday 's events have shown , it 's a matter of life and death			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity165			2
