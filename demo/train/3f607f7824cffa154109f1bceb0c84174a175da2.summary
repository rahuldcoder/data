@entity2 , @entity3 artillery and rocket fire can be heard almost constantly in the village @entity2 , about 10 kilometers from the strategic port city of @entity7 in southern @entity3			1
the @entity3 army has dug in here , fearing a possible last - minute assault by @entity12 separatists ahead of a planned ceasefire late saturday			1
armored vehicles with cannons mounted on top fired from a front line position with tanks standing nearby			2
the unit commander , who only identified himself as " @entity20 , " said he did not believe the ceasefire would hold			1
" we know about this so - called ceasefire			1
we have had agreements before			0
the separatists have broken them frequently			1
but we will stick to the agreements and stop the violence coming from their side , " he said as artillery barrages could be heard firing off in the distance			0
over his walkie - talkie a voice could be heard saying : " our artillery is in action			2
" @entity20 says pro-russian separatists have tried several times to overrun his positions , but were repelled each time			2
@entity3 government officials including the prime minister have expressed doubts that the @entity45 truce will succeed , and those doubts are also on display in @entity7			1
we witnessed columns of tanks and armored vehicles making their way to the front line			0
but the @entity3 military also has another problem -- a lack of modern equipment			1
one soldier appeared to need medical attention after a tank 's radiator seemed to blow up close to his head , leaving the vehicle and its crew engulfed in a cloud of white smoke			0
the constant shelling is taking its toll on the civilian population in the areas around @entity7			1
in the village of @entity71 , 58 - year - old @entity69 said she was in her house when a rocket hit the neighbor 's backyard , spraying shrapnel onto the building			2
the man living next door was killed			0
police officers were busy trying to dig the remnants of the rocket out of a hole the projectile had pierced in the ground when our crew arrived at the scene			0
" i have two grandchildren here , " she said , shaking			0
" they are one and three years old			0
of course we are very scared			0
" @entity69 blamed @entity3 forces for firing the rocket , saying she was all but certain that it came from the area where the army is stationed			1
" we do n't need the @entity3 army here , " she said " we do n't need army			1
everyone who came here with weapons started wars			0
please make them go away from here			0
" but for now it appears as though both sides are digging in , with very little trust that this time a ceasefire might lead to a lasting peace .			2
