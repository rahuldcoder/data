his eyes moist and lower lip trembling , @entity0 nodded haltingly at family , comrades , military brass and the president standing to applaud him for receiving the nation 's highest military decoration , the @entity9			1
he never smiled during the @entity11 ceremony on monday and later explained why in a statement to reporters			0
" i stand here with mixed emotions of both joy and sadness today , " he said , describing how he felt " conflicted " about the medal around his neck			0
" the joy comes from recognition from us doing our jobs as soldiers on distant battlefields , " said @entity0 , a former @entity20 staff sergeant dressed in full uniform that included a cavalry hat			1
" but it is countered by the constant reminder of the loss of our battle buddies - my battle buddies , my soldiers , my friends			1
" an @entity38 hero : the uncommon valor of @entity0 for " conspicuous gallantry ... at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty , " @entity0 , 31 , received the honor at an emotional ceremony lightened by his rambunctious toddler son			1
in conferring the medal , president @entity48 described the conditions faced by @entity0 and 52 other soldiers when they came under attack from mortar , rocket - propelled grenade , machine - gun and sniper fire on october 3 , 2009 , at @entity56 in the mountains of eastern @entity58			1
a military investigation later described the outpost as indefensible against the higher - ground positions surrounding it , and @entity48 noted the challenge that @entity0 's unit faced from the estimated 300 @entity66 insurgents			1
explosions from the dawn attack " shook them out of theirs beds and sent them rushing for their weapons , and soon the awful odds became clear , " @entity48 said			0
" what happened next has been described as one of the most intense battles of the entire war in @entity58 , " the president continued			1
" the attackers had the advantage , the high ground , the mountains above , and they were unleashing everything they had -- rocket - propelled grenades , heavy machine guns , mortars , snipers taking aim			0
" @entity0 and his men " had never seen anything like it , " @entity48 said			1
@entity0 , the bravest of the brave " with gunfire impacting all around him , @entity0 raced to one of the barracks and grabbed a machine gun , " the president said			2
" he took aim at one of the enemy machine teams and took it out			0
a rocket - propelled grenade exploded , sending shrapnel into his hip , his arm and his neck , but he kept fighting , disregarding his own wounds and tended to an injured comrade instead			0
" later in the battle , @entity0 and his team charged more than 100 yards through enemy fire to reach wounded soldiers in the outpost , @entity48 added			1
the audience on monday included relatives of the eight soldiers killed in the battle , and @entity48 paid tribute to the efforts by @entity0 and his fellow soldiers to bring them back			1
" our troops should never ever be put in a position where they have to defend the indefensible , " @entity48 said			0
" that 's what these soldiers did for each other in sacrifice driven by pure love , and because they did , eight grieving families were at least able to welcome their soldiers home one last time			0
" before the @entity134 ceremony , the militaristic and somber atmosphere was lightened by @entity0 's son , @entity135 , who climbed the podium and examined the lectern , briefly playing hide - and - seek with the bemused onlookers			2
it took a military escort to entice @entity135 to his mother 's arms in the first row , and when @entity48 spoke a few minutes later , he prompted chuckles in pointing out the boy 's exuberant nature			0
" @entity135 is not as shy as @entity0 , " @entity48 said			2
" he was in the @entity147 and he was racing around pretty good and sampled a number of apples before he found the one that was just right			0
" @entity0 was invited to be the guest of first lady @entity153 tuesday at the president 's @entity156 address			2
but he declined the invitation , telling @entity158 that he has decided to spend the evening with friends from his former unit , @entity161 , 3 - 61 @entity162 , his wife @entity163 -- with whom he celebrates a wedding anniversary tuesday -- and their families			0
@entity0 to be guest of first lady at @entity156 @entity0 is the fourth living person to receive the nation 's highest military decoration for actions in @entity58 or @entity170			1
the battle at @entity56 raged for more than 12 hours			0
when it ended , with @entity0 and others having held onto the outpost , more than half of their 53 - soldier contingent had been killed or wounded			1
despite his own wounds , @entity0 led a charge across the outpost that regained control of the ammunition supply depot			1
in doing so , he ignored an order to hold his position , pretending the radio was broken			0
the @entity38 military closed the heavily damaged outpost three days later , destroying what remained to prevent it from aiding insurgents in any way			2
a few months later , a @entity38 military investigation found that measures taken to protect the outpost were lax , and critical intelligence and reconnaissance assistance had been diverted from the base			0
the @entity9 : what is it ?			2

@entity0 speaks of the loss of " my battle buddies , my soldiers , my friends "

he led *counter-attacks* against a 2009 assault by insurgents on a remote outpost
