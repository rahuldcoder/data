-- the gulf between smartphones and cameras is getting smaller , thanks to a new point - and - shoot camera from @entity6 that 's powered by the @entity8 operating system			1
the 16 - megapixel @entity10 camera , announced wednesday , will be the first camera running @entity8 on the market when it hits shelves in september			2
the addition of @entity8 brings a few much - needed features to the point - and - shoot			1
users can download mobile apps from the @entity20 store and share images over cellular networks by tethering to a nearby smartphone or tablet			1
pinterest releases new @entity27 and @entity8 apps when phone makers first started adding tiny , low - resolution cameras to their devices , the camera industry was not terribly threatened			1
they had glorious digital slr cameras with interchangeable lenses , sleek pocket cameras with large sensors and manual controls , and features like high - @entity38 for low - light shooting , megazoom , and rugged bodies for the outdoors			0
anyone who loved photos would certainly prefer the high - quality shots captured on " real " cameras , right ? but the camera companies underestimated just how important convenience was to consumers , and the public 's appetite for sharing photos of moments right when they happened			2
the resulting cellphone images were low - quality , but nothing a little sepia - filter could n't fix			0
the @entity57 was not the first phone to have a camera , but it made sharing images online , over its cellular connection , a snap			0
in 2011 , more than a quarter of photos and videos were captured using a smartphone , according to a study from research company @entity68			0
that number is only getting larger			0
the $ 350 @entity10 is bringing some of what has made those smartphones so popular to a camera			0
it does n't have a cellular connection , but it does have @entity74			0
wireless connections have been around for a while on cameras , but the addition of @entity8 means the camera can tether to a smartphone or tablet running @entity8 when there 's no @entity74 handy			1
the 3.5 - inch touchscreen display gives users access to the @entity20 store , where photogs can go to download more apps for their camera , including editing tools and social networks , such as @entity91 , @entity92 and , of course , @entity94			1
the camera can also run all the regular smartphone apps , allowing users to send e-mail , browse the @entity99 , listen to music and play games			2
like @entity104 's @entity103 , it draws the line at making phone calls , however			0
the camera has 10x zoom , can shoot 1080p video , and includes gps and maps for tagging images with locations			0
there are no manual controls			0
the @entity10 is running @entity8 2.3 , known as @entity116 , which is not the most recent version of the operating system			1
that @entity6 is the first to bring an @entity8 camera to market is a surprise , since competitors @entity122 and @entity124 already make @entity8 devices and were in a better position to combine the two products			1
@entity128 showed off a demo camera running @entity8 at the @entity130 show in january , the @entity131 , but it is n't yet available			2
@entity6 's @entity8 camera may be a first in the camera industry , but it 's still playing catch - up to the real competitors : smartphones with increasingly higher - quality cameras .			1

@entity6 's new point - and - shoot camera is powered by the @entity8 operating system
the touchscreen camera can access the @entity20 store and run apps
for instant sharing , *photographers* can use the camera 's @entity74 or tether it to a smartphone or tablet
