@entity0 , @entity1 -- who is @entity4 ? is she a two - faced she - devil , angelic and compassionate to some but @entity7 and @entity8 - like to others ? that 's what @entity11 , the lawyer for a man @entity12 falsely accused in the 2007 murder of her roommate , @entity16 , called her as he summed up his case last week			1
is she " @entity4 , " as the @entity23 tabloid press leered and sneered at her within hours of her exoneration in @entity21 's murder monday ? or is she the fresh - faced girl from @entity25 she still appears to be , even after spending nearly four years behind bars before her conviction was quashed ? is @entity12 simply the victim of character assassination , painted falsely as a " femme fatale " by prosecutors and media the world over ? defense lawyer @entity34 advanced that theory in her own closing argument			1
she compared @entity12 to @entity38 , the hourglass - shaped , husky - voiced cartoon character who insists in the movie " @entity43 ? " that she 's not bad , she 's just " drawn that way			1
" five women and three men on a jury here weighed in decisively on who @entity12 is monday , throwing out the five most serious charges she was originally convicted of in connection with @entity21 's death and releasing her from prison			1
@entity54 in courtroom as verdict is read the jury also freed @entity58 , her former boyfriend who became her co-defendant			0
their release came at the end of an appeal lasting just over four months and feeling much more like a re-trial than an appeal as understood in the @entity66 or @entity21 's native @entity23			0
lawyers battled on two fronts -- dna evidence and @entity12 's character			1
police scientists argued that a knife found at @entity58 's home had traces of @entity21 's @entity69 on the blade and @entity12 's dna on the handle			1
and they testified that a bra clasp belonging to @entity21 and found in her room had @entity58 's genetic material on it			0
experts appointed by the court questioned police handling of the evidence , suggesting authorities ' sloppiness could make the dna results unreliable and should make them inadmissible in court			0
prosecution witnesses , meanwhile , maintained that the tests were valid -- leading to highly technical and sometimes heated courtroom arguments and prompting the prosecution to ask for new dna tests , a request the judge rejected			0
no end to @entity12 as pop culture obsession @entity12 and @entity58 do not have airtight alibis for the night of november 1 , 2007 , when @entity21 's throat was slashed , her semi-naked body left under a bed cover			1
their cell phones and @entity58 's computer were switched off at the time of the murder , depriving them of potentially exculpatory evidence			0
but while they can not prove they were not at the scene of the crime , their defense team says the prosecution can not prove that they were			1
there was no physical trace of them in the room where @entity21 died , @entity12 and @entity58 's lawyers insisted			2
they argued that the crime was solely the work of drifter @entity16 , who was convicted separately and is serving 16 years			0
his dna was all over the crime scene , the defense said			0
that may have been enough for the jury to set @entity12 and @entity58 free			2
defense lawyer @entity130 reminded the jury repeatedly monday morning that the prosecution needed to prove its case " beyond a reasonable doubt " -- a standard he made a point of saying was rooted in @entity1 law and was not imported from @entity66 , in a nod to the nationalistic tensions that have sometimes seemed to underpin this case			2
the jury must have had sufficient doubts to overturn a verdict rendered by eight of their compatriots less than two years ago			0
that means that either @entity12 and @entity58 were the victims of a miscarriage of justice then , or that @entity21 is now			2
only @entity12 and @entity58 themselves may know which it is -- because nearly four years after @entity21 's death , incontrovertible evidence about whether @entity12 and @entity58 were involved remains maddeningly elusive			1
@entity2 's @entity156 and @entity157 contributed to this report .			0

@entity12 was cleared in the 2007 death of her roommate
the defense maintains prosecutors ca *n't* prove her involvement
