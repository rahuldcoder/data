-- when @entity2 finished a soaring rendition of " @entity4 " to open her set at @entity7 's @entity6 last night -- the kickoff gig for her @entity10 tour -- she did a mini-curtsy and took a long swig from a teacup			1
" i 'm really , really , really nervous , " she told the mostly female sell - out crowd			0
" the last time i was here , the guy who inspired ' 21 ' was with me			0
" the assembled roared in solidarity			0
it was the beginning of a non-stop monologue that continued between the set 's 16 songs , drawn mostly from " 21 , " the deeply personal break - up album that has sold 1.5 million copies this year			1
it seemed that if she stopped talking , even for a moment , the emotions that clearly simmered just below the surface might explode			1
her fans could easily have filled a venue much larger than the 1,200 - capacity club -- as , clearly , could her voice			0
but @entity2 's nerves might not be ready for anything less intimate			1
choose the cover of @entity0 : vote now ! wearing a high - belted black dress and standing mostly still on a set seemingly designed to look like a retro @entity39 flat , with @entity41 rugs and two dozen vintage lampshades dangling at various heights , @entity2 belted out her heartache in song after earnest song			1
the material might have turned grating or repetitive in the hands of a lesser talent , but the 23 - year - old @entity51 's reservoir is so deep and the passion so palpable that it 's hard to take your eyes off her			1
" i do n't know why i get so hot -- it 's not like i 'm dancing like @entity60 , " she quipped after the particularly melancholic " @entity56 " before releasing a signature laugh - honk and moving on to gabbing about the royal wedding			2
" i liked the kissing bit best , " she said			0
" they just seemed like any boyfriend and girlfriend			0
" " turning tables , " one of the angrier tracks on 21 , was given a smart , spare arrangement that highlighted the power of @entity2 's voice , which carried effortlessly into the high rafters , pulling goosebumps from hundreds of arms -- and more than a few tears			1
read excerpts from @entity0 's cover story on @entity2 one of the night 's biggest ovations came when the singer introduced her cover of " if it had n't been for @entity80 , " by bluegrass band the @entity79			1
" it 's about shooting your wife , " she said			2
" i 'm not condoning it , but i want to shoot a few f * * * ing men in my life			0
" when she played the re-imagined cover of the @entity91 's " @entity90 " from 21 , she mentioned that the arrangement was originally written for @entity93 , who passed on it			2
she went on to list her " favorites " as @entity93 , @entity96 , @entity97 , and @entity98 -- a list that accurately reflects @entity2 's own potent mix of soul and schmaltz			1
@entity0 : before @entity2 -- a history of @entity105 soul divas as the set wound down , it was clear the weight was lifting off her shoulders			1
" i ca n't believe i 've managed to wear my high heels throughout the whole show ! " she blurted before launching into " @entity110 , " perhaps the most devastating song on 21 , in which she confronts her former lover 's marriage			2
" nevermind , i 'll find someone like you / i wish nothing but the best for you too , " she sang with shaking hands			0
" do n't forget me , i beg			0
" returning for a triumphant encore -- " the shoes are off ! " she declared -- @entity2 did n't so much deliver her propulsive , bitter signature hit " @entity126 " as introduce it			2
this time , her booming voice was just the loudest in a sing - along in which her thousand - plus tribe shared the cathartic joy of acceptance and resilience			0
@entity2 , in all her pop - culture referencing , quippy glory , delivers that as well as anyone			2
