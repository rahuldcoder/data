-- @entity1 officially renounced the expiring @entity2 on monday , a day after international negotiators agreed to extend the treaty 's limits on carbon emissions blamed for a warming climate			1
environment minister @entity8 said @entity9 would keep working to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and help negotiate a new framework for a global pact			1
but in a statement to reporters on his return from last week 's climate conference in @entity17 , @entity8 said that for @entity1 , @entity19 " is in the past			2
" prime minister @entity22 's @entity21 government has long opposed the @entity2 and has refused to implement it since taking office in 2006			0
ahead of the decision , the opposition @entity25 accused his government of " standing up for big polluters " at the expense of ordinary @entity1 and risking the country 's reputation by abandoning the 1997 treaty			0
@entity8 said @entity19 's goals were unworkable because the @entity37 and @entity38 -- the world 's two largest sources of carbon emissions -- never agreed to @entity19 , and that a new pact is needed to address emissions from rapidly growing economies including those of @entity38 , @entity43 and @entity44			1
special : the road to @entity46 the government announced in 2010 that it would fall well short of the treaty 's target of a 6 % cut in emissions below 1990 levels by 2012			0
@entity8 said the previous government signed onto the treaty " without any regard to how it would be fulfilled , " and that @entity1 faced " radical " cuts or financial penalties equivalent to $ 1,600 per family as a result			2
he said @entity1 was " well on our way " to reducing emissions by 17 % over 2005 levels by 2020 , but critics say that self - imposed goal is well below the @entity19 targets			0
@entity66 in the @entity46 talks agreed to extend @entity19 's efforts over the weekend and launched an effort to set up a broader pact with a legal format to curb carbon emissions			1
the talks also launched a @entity72 , which would essentially channel about $ 100 billion by 2020 to vulnerable countries to help them deal with the effects of climate change .			0
