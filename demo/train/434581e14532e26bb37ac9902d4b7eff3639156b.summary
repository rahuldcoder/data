@entity0 -- just days after suggesting lawmakers might not debate @entity5 military involvement in @entity6 until next year , house speaker @entity2 said he 'd agree to call @entity7 back into session to vote if president @entity9 sends up a resolution asking for the authority			1
@entity2 told @entity13 's @entity12 that if the president wanted a vote , " i 'd bring the @entity7 back " -- never mind that the @entity5 has already begun airstrikes inside @entity6 as part of a coalition			1
@entity2 hopes the president requests and sends up an authorization for use of military force as soon as possible , " his spokesman , @entity18 , told @entity1 monday			1
@entity2 left a much different impression in an interview published thursday in the @entity25			1
he told the @entity25 he does n't believe it was appropriate for the so - called " lame duck " @entity7 to vote on military action since so many members would be leaving and those just elected would n't be eligible to vote until january			0
" i would suggest to you that early next year , assuming that we continue in this effort , there may be that discussion and there may be that request from the president , " @entity2 told the @entity25			1
leaders from both parties have come under criticism for leaving town without debating action in @entity6			2
" it 's an act of cowardice on the part of @entity7 , " sen. @entity43 told @entity1 's " @entity47 " on monday			0
" they did n't want to vote before the election			0
" @entity43 : watching @entity51 rise is like ' watching a train wreck ' @entity18 denied that the speaker was sending mixed messages			0
he noted that even though the @entity2 continues to oppose taking up major policy issues during lame - duck sessions , he would schedule a war debate if the @entity9 administration decided it needed congressional approval of the military campaign against @entity51			2
pressure on congressional leaders to vote on authorizing the war has been growing			0
lawmakers left town earlier this month to campaign for the midterms			1
since then , airstrikes in @entity67 and @entity6 have intensified and many members are becoming increasingly vocal about the need for @entity7 to vote			2
it 's unlikely the president would press for a vote before the midterms because many democrats are reluctant to take a controversial vote ahead of the elections			2
@entity9 admits @entity51 threat was misjudged as @entity5 splits emerge on monday , @entity80 @entity79 told @entity81 that @entity2 should n't wait for the president to initiate a debate on @entity83 about @entity51			1
" since when do we sit around waiting , using the excuse he did n't ask ? " @entity79 said at a meeting with @entity81 reporters , and added , " no , if you want to have an authorization that has any constraints on the president , you do n't wait for him to write it			0
" the speaker 's office also held out the possibility that it would move on its own legislation			0
a day with @entity2 saying " there 's only one commander in chief at a time , and it is traditionally his responsibility " to propose a new authorization , @entity18 told @entity1 " the speaker has n't ruled out independent congressional action if the president does n't request " an authorization for use of military force			1
@entity2 criticized the president for repeatedly insisting no @entity5 combat troops would be deployed to battle @entity51 and indicated he could support sending @entity5 combat troops into @entity6 at some point			1
" we have no choice			0
they intend to kill us			0
and if we do n't destroy them first , we 're going to pay the price , " @entity2 told @entity13 .			0
