-- judging solely by the headlines , one might conclude that @entity3 's economy is finally starting to hit a wall			1
after several decades of near double - digit annual growth , gross domestic product rose by a relatively cool 7.5 % in this year 's first half			2
so is investment in factory capacity and real estate			0
but companies that interpret slower gdp growth to mean that business opportunities in @entity3 and other emerging markets will begin to fade are making a serious mistake			1
the consumer class is still growing rapidly in key emerging markets , and the competition from savvy , extremely capable domestic companies is intensifying			1
in @entity3 's case , the lower gdp growth rate actually reflects an important structural shift in the economy -- from growth that is driven by extraordinarily high fixed investment fueled by loans from government - owned banks to growth that is driven by private consumption			1
this transition has been a top goal of the @entity3 leadership as it seeks more balanced and sustainable economic growth			2
@entity3 illustrates an important phenomenon found in many emerging markets			1
what many gloomy economic reports miss is that private consumption continues to rise			1
this is fueled by steady , rapid growth in the country 's middle - class and affluent households , which in @entity3 we at the @entity47 ( @entity47 ) regard as having annual disposable incomes of at least $ 12,500			1
since 2010 , people living in middle - class and affluent households surged from 10 % of @entity3 's population to 25 %			1
in just another three years , this share is projected to leap to 35 % , according to @entity47 analysis			0
some of the sharpest consumption growth in @entity3 is occurring among the upper middle class , which we classify as households with annual disposable household incomes of $ 25,000 to $ 50,000			1
the population in this income segment has been has been rising 12 % annually			0
astonishingly , @entity3 upper middle class are projected to account for 5 % of global consumption by 2020			1
these consumers are the sweet spot for many international companies because they tend to sharply accelerate their consumption in such product categories as automobiles , premium personal - care products , fresh foods , financial services , and travel			0
while companies like the e-commerce giant @entity75 generate the most buzz , it is only one of many innovative companies prospering from the rapid growth of @entity3 's middle class			1
at @entity47 , we have been tracking a particularly impressive group of hard - charging competitors that we refer to as " local dynamos " -- emerging market - based companies that are staying home and conquering their domestic markets			2
the dynamos move at breathtaking speed , have formidable business models for catering to local consumers , are highly adaptable and are remarkably adept at taking advantage of digital technologies			0
they have averaged compound annual revenue growth of 28 % annually over the past four years , compared with 5 % annual growth among @entity100 companies			0
eleven of the 50 dynamos that we identified globally in a recent report are consumer goods companies -- more than from any other sector			0
this reflects the opportunities created by surging consumption in emerging markets			1
ten of the 50 are based in @entity3			0
they span sectors from banking and food retailing to consumer electronics			0
@entity116 illustrates how @entity3 dynamos can operate successfully while moving at warp speed			0
@entity116 saw a huge opportunity in the underserved and highly fragmented market for budget hotels			0
from 2008 to 2013 , it increased its number of hotels from 500 to more than 2,000 , in part through an aggressive strategy of franchising			0
it also boosted the number of cities served from fewer than 100 to 300			0
with revenues of $ 1 billion in 2013 , @entity116 controls nearly 25 % of @entity3 's branded economy - hotel segment			2
@entity131 , another dynamo , demonstrates the digital prowess of @entity3 's new breed of consumer - product companies			1
@entity131 relies entirely on e-commerce to sell its affordable smart phones , which are priced at between $ 100 and $ 300			0
to reach @entity3 's internet - crazed youth , @entity131 uses a variety of popular social media to extensively market its products and solicit customer feedback , which it incorporates when designing and improving its devices			2
after just three years in operation , @entity131 reached $ 5 billion in revenue in 2013 and sold more smartphones in @entity3 -- nearly 19 million -- than @entity148			0
@entity131 passed @entity149 in the second quarter of 2014 as @entity3 's top smartphone brand			2
even if companies have little interest in the @entity3 market , the local dynamos should be on their radar because they are potential future global competitors			2
a number of companies on @entity47 's 2014 list of " global challengers " -- fast - growing companies based in emerging markets that are becoming global leaders or have the potential to do so -- have followed the path of leveraging their dominance in domestic markets to go global			1
twenty - nine of the 100 challengers on the 2014 list are @entity3 , including appliance maker @entity173 , automaker @entity174 , and medical device producer @entity175			0
prominent examples from other emerging markets are @entity180 wine maker @entity179 , @entity3 appliance marker @entity181 , @entity185 cellular phone giant @entity183 , @entity188 fast - food conglomerate @entity186 , and @entity191 vehicle companies @entity189 and @entity192 & @entity193			1
whether one sees @entity3 and other emerging markets as the world 's biggest growth opportunities -- or as the source of potential threat -- do n't let slower gdp statistics distract you into pulling back			1
the battle for a share of the growing consumer class is underway now and will grow more fierce			2
