@entity0 -- republicans took voters ' distress over the stubborn jobless rate and stalled economy and turned it into a sweeping takeover of the @entity9 @entity8 in tuesday 's midterm elections , while @entity11 were able to hang onto their majority in the @entity13 , though in smaller numbers			1
with results still coming in , the extent of the @entity2 takeover of the 435 - member @entity8 was still to be determined			1
but @entity1 projected that @entity2 would win at least 60 more @entity8 seats than they currently hold to wipe out the @entity11 majority of the past four years			1
president @entity20 called @entity8 minority leader @entity21 of @entity22 to congratulate him			1
they had a brief but pleasant conversation , according to @entity21 's aides			1
the two discussed working together to focus on the top priorities of the @entity29 people , which @entity21 has identified as creating jobs and cutting spending			1
@entity21 thanked the president for the call			1
@entity2 candidates also were running strong in governors ' races , while @entity11 were guaranteed of holding at least 50 of the 100 @entity13 seats with a handful of close races still outstanding , according to the projections based on @entity1 's analysis of exit poll data			1
senate majority leader @entity43 , @entity44 , retained his @entity13 seat by defeating @entity2 @entity46 , a @entity47 favorite			1
an energized conservative electorate , fueled by the anti-establishment @entity47 movement that emerged in 2009 , helped republicans to what could be their biggest gain in congressional elections in decades			1
" it 's clear tonight who the real winners are , and it 's the @entity29 people , " said @entity21 , who is expected to become house speaker in january when the new @entity2 majority takes over			1
" with their voices , the @entity29 people are demanding a new way forward in @entity0 , " @entity21 said , calling for conservative policies favored by the @entity47 such as cutting spending and reducing the size of government			1
@entity47 - backed republicans @entity65 in @entity67 and @entity68 in @entity69 won their @entity13 races , while another @entity2 candidate , @entity71 , will defeat incumbent @entity73 @entity72 in @entity74 , according to the projections			1
in @entity77 , conservative @entity2 @entity76 was the projected winner to take over the @entity13 seat held by retiring @entity73 @entity80 , while the @entity2 's @entity81 toppled @entity11 incumbent sen. @entity82 in @entity83			1
the projected victories by @entity76 , @entity71 , @entity81 and @entity85 in @entity86 gave @entity2 four pick - ups in the @entity13			1
however , democrat @entity88 was the projected winner over @entity2 @entity90 , another @entity47 - supported candidate , in @entity92 's @entity13 race for the seat formerly held for decades by vice president @entity94			1
in @entity96 , @entity11 attorney general @entity95 will defeat @entity2 @entity97 , the former professional wrestling executive , for the @entity13 seat held by retiring @entity73 @entity98			2
another big @entity11 victory came in @entity100 , where gov. @entity101 was projected to win the @entity13 seat formerly held by the late @entity11 sen. @entity103 , who died earlier this year			0
the projected victories by @entity88 , @entity101 and @entity95 were vital for the @entity11 ' chances to retain their majority in the @entity13			0
but @entity20 's former @entity13 seat in @entity108 went to @entity2 @entity109 , who defeated democrat @entity110			1
whatever the final make - up of the @entity13 , it will include no @entity29 members			0
the only current @entity29 - @entity29 senator , @entity114 of @entity108 , is retiring , and none of the three @entity29 candidates won on tuesday			0
both @entity65 , the son of rep. @entity118 of @entity119 , and @entity90 rode @entity47 support to defeat mainstream @entity2 candidates in their @entity2 primaries			2
@entity65 's projected victory to claim the seat held by retiring @entity2 sen. @entity125 showed the influence of the movement that emerged in 2009 in opposition to expanded government and the growing federal deficit			2
at the same time , the loss by @entity90 could badly hurt @entity2 chances to win majority control of the @entity13			1
many @entity2 believed the veteran congressman whom @entity90 beat in the primary , former gov. @entity136 , would have defeated @entity88			2
another @entity47 backed candidate , @entity2 @entity138 , will be handily defeated by @entity73 @entity139 in the @entity142 governor 's race , the projections show			2
@entity1 projects democrat @entity143 will defeat @entity2 @entity144 in @entity145 for the governorship now held by @entity2 @entity147 , who is stepping down under term limits			1
@entity150 gov. @entity149 , who gained national attention for her support of @entity150 's controversial new immigration law , defeated democrat @entity154 to retain office			0
in other gubernatorial contests , republicans @entity156 in @entity158 , @entity159 in @entity160 , @entity161 in @entity119 , @entity162 in @entity163 , @entity164 in @entity165 , @entity166 in @entity167 , @entity168 in @entity169 , @entity170 in @entity171 and @entity172 in @entity173 will be victorious , according to the projections			0
@entity11 winners for governor included incumbents @entity178 in @entity180 and @entity181 in @entity182 , the projections showed			0
republicans needed a net gain of only three governorships tuesday for a majority nationally			2
often overshadowed during midterm campaigns , governorships can impact national politics by their influence in the redistricting of state electorates			0
exit poll data analyzed by @entity1 showed the economy was the dominant issue on the minds of voters and indicated that key constituencies shifted from supporting @entity11 in 2008 to voting for @entity2 this time			1
for example , senior citizens who comprised 24 percent of the total electorate supported @entity2 much more strongly on tuesday than they did two years ago , the exit polling showed			1
according to the data , 39 percent of senior citizens voted for @entity11 , compared with 49 percent in 2008 , while 58 percent supported @entity2 , compared with 49 percent two years ago			1
one reason is likely opposition to the health care reform bill pushed through @entity208 over @entity2 opposition by president @entity20 and @entity11 leaders			1
while @entity20 pledged the reforms would improve @entity213 , @entity2 opponents warned of service cuts and higher costs			1
the long and bitter campaign season drew more than $ 3.5 billion in spending , making it the most expensive nonpresidential vote ever , according to the nonpartisan @entity219 , a watchdog group			0
the rise of the @entity47 movement added a new element to the election cycle , roiling @entity2 races by boosting little - known and inexperienced candidates to victory over mainstream figures in @entity2 primaries across the country			2
no matter how many of the so - called @entity47 candidates win against @entity11 opponents tuesday , the influence of the movement has shifted the @entity2 agenda to the right			2
" they tell me they want people who can work together in @entity0 , " @entity236 , one of the leading backers of @entity47 candidates , said in his victory speech			0
" i tell you this : i 'm ready			0
anyone whose guide is the constitution and whose goal is limited government , i 'm ready to work with them today			0
but i 'm not going to compromise with anyone who does n't believe in that			0
" exit polling showed voter dissatisfaction with both parties , as each received a 53 percent unfavorable rating			0
the economy was rated the most important issue by 62 percent of voters , far eclipsing health care reform ( 19 percent ) , immigration ( 8 percent ) and the war in @entity263 ( 7 percent ) , according to the exit polling			0
most voters , 88 percent , rated economic conditions as not good or poor , and 86 percent said they were very worried or somewhat worried about the economy , the exit polling showed			0
voters across the country offered a variety of reasons for their choices tuesday			0
in @entity277 , @entity274 , restaurant manager and internet entrepreneur @entity276 , 40 , went to the polls hoping " that the entrenched incumbents get booted out of office , " he said			0
@entity282 , 24 , of @entity283 , @entity145 , cast her ballot partly for the thrill of the experience , she said			0
" you do n't get to vote every day			0
it 's sort of its own holiday			0
you research the issues , vote and then wait to see if your position was the majority			0
it 's as exciting to me as the @entity299 last night , " she said on the heels of the @entity297 ' victory			0
@entity300 of @entity301 , @entity69 , went to the polls with her son to teach him about the importance of voting			0
" my youngest is almost 2 years old , and i showed him the ballot , and he wanted to help fill in the circles , " said @entity301 , 28			0
" it is good to teach them from an early age to be involved in the welfare of our country and that we all have rights and duties to preserve			0
" unemployment , at a rate of 9.6 percent amid a slow recovery from economic recession , has been the dominant issue , with republicans accusing @entity20 and the @entity11 of pushing through expensive policies that have expanded government without solving the problem			2
@entity20 has led democrats in defending his record , saying that steps such as the economic stimulus bill and auto industry bailout were necessary to prevent a depression , while health care reform and @entity335 reform will lay the foundation for sustainable future growth			2
observers warned that the expected @entity2 gains offer little chance of compromise or bipartisan approaches on major issues			2
@entity21 already has signaled little appetite to negotiate with the @entity345 or congressional democrats , saying last week that " this is not a time for compromise			2
" in the @entity13 , legislative gridlock is likely as @entity2 strengthen their current minority of 41 seats			1
@entity20 and @entity11 accuse @entity13 @entity2 of using obstruction tactics as a political tool , showing the distrust and animosity that already exists			1
democrats are also wary of a recent comment by @entity358 @entity357 , who told the @entity359 , " the single most important thing we want to achieve is for president @entity20 to be a one - term president			1
" the first test of a new relationship will come in mid-november , when @entity208 convenes a post-election lame - duck session to try to clear unfinished legislation before the newly elected @entity208 gathers in january			0
among other issues , lawmakers must decide whether and how to extend @entity370 - era tax cuts			0
@entity1 's @entity371 , @entity372 , @entity373 , @entity374 , @entity375 , @entity376 , @entity377 and @entity378 contributed to this report .			2
