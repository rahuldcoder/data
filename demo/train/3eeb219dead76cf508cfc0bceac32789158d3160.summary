@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's new defense minister said his country would respond with airstrikes if @entity7 attacks it again , @entity1 state media reported friday			1
it is some of the strongest rhetoric since the conflict broke out late last month			0
" we will definitely air raid @entity7 , " @entity12 said at his confirmation hearing when asked how the @entity1 would respond if struck again , according to the official @entity14			1
@entity12 was appointed defense minister last week amid growing tensions on the @entity18 following an exchange of gunfire between the two sides			1
his comments reflect a potential shift in @entity1 's policy toward provocations from the @entity7			1
previously , @entity1 president @entity26 warned of severe consequences if the @entity28 launched another attack , but declined to name specifics			0
" if the @entity28 commits any additional provocations against the @entity1 , we will make sure that it pays a dear price without fail , " he said in a nationally televised address monday			0
@entity34 , an expert on @entity7 who has visited the country more than 50 times , called @entity12 's comments " an important development			1
" " the use of airstrikes is quite significant , " said @entity34 , a professor at the @entity39 and director of the school 's @entity41			0
" just sending bullets from @entity1 is one thing but sending aircraft over @entity7 is something else			2
" however , he cautioned that the ramped - up rhetoric is " almost entirely for domestic consumption " as the @entity1 deals with criticism over what some have called a weak response to the @entity28 's november 23 shelling of @entity1 's @entity55			1
the attack killed four @entity1 -- two civilians and two military personnel -- and the @entity1 returned fire			0
the country 's defense minister at the time , @entity61 , resigned last week after the exchange of fire			1
" the climate is that the @entity1 military did not respond strongly enough to the original attack , and that really led to the resignation of the defense minister , " @entity34 said			1
" so the new candidate for the job is expected to show strong resolve and determination in the strongest terms possible			0
" last month 's attack was the first direct artillery assault on @entity1 since 1953 , when an armistice ended fighting			0
the @entity28 accused the @entity1 of provoking the attack because shells from a @entity1 military drill landed in the @entity7 's territorial waters along the region 's tense maritime border in the @entity84			2
@entity12 criticized the @entity1 's response to the attack , saying friday that military officials should have ordered immediate airstrikes after the shelling , according to @entity14			1
he also said the military missed intelligence pointing to a possible attack by the @entity7			2
meanwhile friday , the @entity1 made preparations to begin new live - fire drills along five islands in the @entity84 -- including @entity55 -- in an effort to deter future provocations from the @entity7 , @entity14 reported			1
the move threatens to further stoke tensions with the @entity7			1
the live fire drills are a routine monthly exercise aimed at securing the safety of ships in the area , the @entity1 's @entity100 told @entity2 earlier this week			0
they were originally scheduled to begin monday , but @entity14 reported that authorities have not determined the exact timing			2
one @entity100 official was quoted by @entity14 as saying the @entity1 hopes to resume the drills " as soon as possible			2
" @entity7 previously warned that joint military drills between the @entity111 and @entity1 could lead to " all - out war any time			0
" " if the @entity111 and the @entity116 - like forces fire even a shell into the inviolable land and territorial waters of the ( @entity7 ) , they will have to pay dearly for this , " the @entity113 reported			0
the joint drills ended tuesday			0
@entity2 's @entity122 contributed to this report .			0
