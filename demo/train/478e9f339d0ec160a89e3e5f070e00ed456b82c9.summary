@entity0 -- my son , @entity2 , died aboard the @entity5 deepwater horizon oil rig on april 20 , 2010			1
that statement , standing on its own , might say everything about my life these days			2
but in truth it says little			0
although i am consumed with grief over the loss of @entity2 , because i am a lawyer , i am needed elsewhere			1
@entity2 's older brother @entity13 and i are directing all our energies to try to make right an outdated law that would deprive my daughter - in - law , @entity18 , and her two boys , my grandsons , of " more nearly fair compensation " for the loss of their husband and father			1
i make careful use of the term " more nearly fair compensation " because no amount of money could ever compensate any of us for @entity2 's loss			1
our loss , and the loss of everyone who ever knew @entity2 , is incalculable in mere dollars			1
but our system provides that money damages must be paid by wrongdoers when they cause the death of another			2
judges and juries do their best to arrive at the " most nearly fair " amount to try to compensate loved ones for their losses			2
in a system that is imperfect , the death on the @entity43 stands alone in the draconian way it limits the recovery of damages for wrongful deaths on the high seas			2
it is a law passed in 1920 , almost a century ago , and it was intended to provide for widows and others who lost breadwinners to wrongful acts at sea			1
but the law provides only for the recovery of " pecuniary " damages , known popularly as " out - of - pocket expenses			2
" @entity18 and her sons , one of whom was born a few weeks after @entity2 was killed , are entitled to recover only the loss of the income @entity2 would have earned , minus any income taxes , and minus whatever amounts it is determined he would consume himself			1
once that figure is established , an economist would be employed to estimate the present day value of those future losses			0
as the law stands , that final number is all that @entity72 has to pay @entity18 and her sons			1
common sense tells us , though , that the loss of @entity2 's paycheck is relatively insignificant compared with the loss of @entity2 himself			1
when @entity18 tells her boys about their dad , she 's not going to show them a pay stub			2
she 'll tell them how much he loved them both , how funny he was , what a good golfer he was and how much others loved to be around him			0
one of the last things @entity2 , a 1 handicap , got to do was to give @entity90 , age 2 , his first golf lesson			1
it was , of course , the last golf lesson he will get from his father			0
so how much is " most nearly enough " to compensate them for @entity2 's loss ? that will be for jurors to decide once they have heard evidence , not only about how the disaster happened , but about the loss that will always be felt by those who loved him			1
@entity103 3463 , introduced by sen. @entity104 ; and @entity105 , by chairman of the @entity107 and rep. @entity108 , seek to address the inequities of @entity110			0
both proposals , which have multiple co-sponsors , allow for the recovery not only of pecuniary damages , but non-pecuniary damages as well			0
" non-pecuniary damages " are defined as " loss of care , company and companionship			0
" that definition is intended to describe the very great loss suffered by his survivors apart from his earnings alone			0
few knowledgeable people dispute the growing evidence that @entity72 was negligent in the way it bungled the completion of the well and caused this blowout , and that its negligence was " willful and wanton , " terms used in maritime law for centuries to provide for the award of punitive damages against this kind of egregious misconduct			1
sadly , after the @entity145 disastrous oil spill , the @entity141 in @entity142 v. @entity143 ruled that punitive damages may be awarded in maritime cases only on a 1:1 ratio with compensatory damages			2
of course , that holding defeats the purpose of punitive damages			0
punitive damages are assessed against wrongdoers for the same reasons we put criminals in jail : to punish the wrongdoer ; to teach the wrongdoer not to act that way again , and to set an example for others			0
the punitive damages as reduced by the @entity141 in @entity142 v. @entity143 did none of those things			0
so sen. @entity167 has introduced @entity168 , which simply provides that in computing punitive damages in maritime cases , the amount of compensatory damages is not to be considered			0
as i testified before the @entity174 , making @entity72 pay punitive damages will hit @entity72 where its heart would be , if it had a heart			1
support for these bills is growing , but we expect opposition from all the companies who do n't want to pay fair compensation when , by their fault , someone on board their vessel is killed			1
cruise lines have consistently opposed changes to @entity110			1
many of their passengers are , because of their youth or advanced age , not providing financial support to anyone			0
if a cruise ship crew member negligently kills one of these passengers , the cruise line is liable for funeral expenses and nothing more			2
all companies involved in offshore drilling and shipping have been vigorously opposed to changes in @entity110			2
the argument these companies make to congressmen and senators is simple : we do n't want to pay " more nearly fair " compensation when we kill people			1
it will cost us too much money			0
they probably go so far as to claim a change in @entity110 will inevitably result in the loss of valuable jobs in each congressman 's district			1
the @entity222 disaster has shined a bright light on the deadly results of negligence on the high seas			0
it is time for @entity228 to recognize that a reprehensibly unfair situation has existed for decades			0
now is the time for cruise lines , the petroleum industry and the shipping companies to finally stop using their economic might to prevent reform			1
they must support -- not oppose -- these bills			0
the @entity239 people will be watching			0
more and more learn each day about the unfairness of @entity110			0
legislators who listen to lobbyists instead of their constituents may regret that choice in november			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity247 .			1

@entity250 ' son @entity2 died on @entity72 oil rig leaving behind wife , two sons
@entity247 trying to change law that deprives @entity2 's family of fair compensation , he says
law passed in 1920 only pays for lost wages if death caused from *malfeasance*
@entity247 : law must change , despite big oil , shipping and cruise lines ' opposition
