@entity0 , @entity1 -- every four years during the @entity4 , millions of people become armchair experts on figure skating : quadruple jumps and combination spins , death spirals and triple salchows			1
and like clockwork , many rinks across the @entity12 see a surge in enrollment for figure skating lessons inspired by @entity18 fever			2
but the costs of seriously pursuing the sport put it out of reach for many families			2
skates alone often cost $ 300 , to say nothing of the ice time , coaching and costumes			0
yet each week in @entity0 , @entity29 helps more than 170 girls hit the ice and skate their way to new heights			1
" the girls really fall in love with gliding , like i did , and realize that they 're doing something very special , " said @entity29 , a former competitive skater who began teaching girls to skate in 1990			1
" before , there were n't a lot of girls ( here ) that could imagine themselves as figure skaters			1
... but the thing about skating is it lets you imagine you can be anything			0
" since 1997 , @entity29 's nonprofit , @entity48 in @entity0 , has provided skating equipment and instruction , tutoring and life skills classes to more than 700 girls from low - income communities			1
lessons for life each week , the girls participate in two 90 - minute group skating classes organized by age and skill level			1
they have fun , get fit and stay safe after school , and @entity29 believes the lessons they 're learning can last a lifetime			1
" they gain discipline , perseverance			0
they fall down , and they get back up , " said @entity29 , 48 " and they learn they can do that in anything			2
" to hit the ice , students must attend tutoring sessions three times a week			0
participants are required to maintain a b + average ; those struggling to do that receive extra help with their studies			1
the organization says more than one - third of the girls earn straight @entity86			2
" we really make them understand that we want ( them ) to be smart and wise and intelligent young women			0
and the fact that you skate is the bonus , " @entity29 said			2
" we 're creating a culture of success			0
" success beyond skating all of the students who 've stayed with the program have graduated high school			0
in contrast , the average graduation rate in @entity0 is 61 %			1
since 2007 , all of the program 's graduates have continued on to college			0
" we want girls to believe and know they can be anything they want to be if they put their hearts and minds to it , " @entity29 said			1
@entity113 joined the group as a first - grader eight years ago			0
she dreams of becoming an astronomer , but she hit a bump last year when she failed algebra			0
" miss @entity29 hired a special tutor for me , " said @entity113 , 14			2
" now i 'm doing way better in school			0
... she is teaching us to be the best we can be in life			0
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2014 @entity128 students pay $ 350 a year to participate in @entity29 's program			1
but with up to 100 girls on the waiting list , @entity29 says this helps ensure that the girls are committed to it			1
one - third of the students get scholarship assistance , and @entity29 says that no one is ever turned away because she can not pay			1
breaking barriers the group recently began competing in team synchronized skating competitions throughout the @entity142			0
" they 're up against teams ( where ) girls skate every day and have private lessons , " @entity29 said			1
" so the fact that they 're even in contention is an amazing achievement			0
" it 's hard work -- because of limited ice time , the group 's senior team practices at 6 a.m. on sundays -- but training as a team gives the girls valuable experience			2
and their presence in competitions adds a dose of diversity to the sport			0
" they 're the only all - minority -- @entity167 , @entity169 -- team out there , " @entity29 said			1
" they 're very proud , and they 're very well - received			0
" @entity29 hopes to one day build an ice skating education center in @entity0 so that more girls can participate			1
she 's also working to bring her program to underserved communities in @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178			2
" when kids are given a blank sheet of ice , they can grow and achieve their personal best , " @entity29 said			0
" that 's what this is about -- giving them the opportunity to find out what they 're made of			0
