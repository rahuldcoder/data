-- want to get in shape , but just do n't have the time ? we found a workout that can scorch calories in as few as four minutes			1
logging an hour - long run on the treadmill may be great exercise , but it can be mind - numbingly dull			2
and while there are lots of other unique workouts and quirky classes to be had at the gym nowadays , they 're not for everyone			2
plus , they all require at least 45 minutes or an hour of your time			2
so with my fellow time - strapped workout warriors in mind , i sampled the @entity24 class at @entity25 in @entity26 and discovered that its condensed " @entity29 " workout style is a potential solution for the " i do n't have time " excuse			1
@entity0 : we tried @entity35 's bootcamp @entity36 is a scientifically proven method to boost endurance in only about 25 minutes or so			1
it 's based on studies of high - intensity intermittent training by @entity43 researcher @entity24			1
in his original 1996 study , @entity24 monitored athletes as they cycled at their absolute highest intensity — 170 % of maximal oxygen uptake ( @entity48 ) — for 20 seconds , followed by 10 seconds of rest			1
this was done for four minutes at a time , for a total of up to eight cycles			2
gyms and studios have adopted the technique and made it their own by adding music , equipment and various exercises to their classes , but the timed intervals typically remain the same			0
if followed correctly , @entity24 should fatigue even the most fit gym bunnies			1
@entity0 : we tried @entity65 workout in my @entity25 class , instructor @entity66 led us in rounds of high - intensity step - ups , lunges and push - ups			1
twenty seconds never felt longer			0
" in this format , you have an increase in your two energy systems : both the aerobic and the anaerobic , " says @entity73			0
" this is almost like a sprint , so a lot of athletes use this method			2
in a football game for example , it 's very start - stop - start - stop			2
using your anaerobic systems helps you build your endurance to do this			2
" @entity0 : @entity92 ( or upside - down ) yoga the key to @entity24 is pushing yourself to the wall of your peak performance at every interval — you know , that point at which you feel as if you will pass out or pass up your lunch			1
each exercise has modifications for optimal performance			0
during the push - up sequence , for example , i opted for run - of - the - mill push - ups while the body - builder next to me clapped between each one			0
even though regular aerobic - style workouts like long - distance running and sculpting classes may burn more calories than @entity24 for the duration of the exercise , @entity73 argues that her class participants see the difference in the hours following the workout			1
" during the 24 to 36 hours after your workout , there is an increase in your resting metabolic rate , " she explains			0
" basically , you are going to burn more fat over the next 24 to 36 hours than you normally would — as opposed to if you were doing a steady state workout like running on a treadmill			0
" @entity0 : we tried the @entity133 workout you can easily adapt the workout to fit your own gym routines			1
if you 're training for a run or a bike race , for example , you can apply the 20 seconds on / 10 seconds rest model to your exercise of choice to best meet your training needs			0
but do n't go overboard , @entity73 warns			0
she recommends doing @entity24 two to three times a week at most			1
" your body will be too taxed to do it every day			0
you do n't really want to do any workout every day			0
the more you vary your workouts , the more benefits you will see , " she says			0
as long you 're cognizant of your personal fitness level , anyone can participate in @entity24			1
just do n't forget to stretch afterward			0
it 's an understatement to say my quads were sore the following morning			0
