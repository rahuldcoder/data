men who are circumcised are less likely to get sexually transmitted infections such as genital herpes and human papillomavirus , but not syphilis , according to a study of adult african men published this week in the @entity8			1
circumcision rates have traditionally been higher in the @entity10 than in @entity11 , but they 've been on the decline			1
the finding adds to the evidence that there are health benefits to circumcision			0
it was already known that circumcision can reduce the risk of penile cancer , a relatively rare disease			1
in a previous study , the same research team found that adult circumcision could reduce the risk of hiv infection			1
efforts to increase the practice of male circumcision in areas with high rates of sexually transmitted infections , including @entity34 , could have a tremendous benefit , say the study 's authors			2
genital herpes has been associated with an increased risk of @entity27 , and @entity4 can cause genital warts as well as a higher risk of anal , cervical ( in women ) , and penile cancers			1
@entity46 : is your partner cheating ? how to protect yourself in the @entity10 , infant circumcision is declining			1
about 64 percent of @entity10 male infants were circumcised in 1995 , down from more than 90 percent in the 1970s			1
rates tend to be higher in whites ( 81percent ) than in blacks ( 65 percent ) or @entity54 ( 54 percent )			0
some opponents say the removal of the foreskin is an unnecessary surgical procedure that may reduce sexual sensitivity in adulthood			0
in @entity63 and @entity64 cultures , young or infant boys are routinely circumcised for religious reasons			2
circumcision rates have traditionally been higher in the @entity10 than in @entity11 , but the @entity67 currently says that the medical benefits are insufficient to recommend circumcision for all baby boys			1
in the new study , a research team at the @entity72 in @entity73 -- in collaboration with researchers from the @entity76 in @entity77 , @entity78 , and @entity79 in @entity73 -- conducted two clinical trials involving 3,393 uncircumcised men ages 15 to 49			0
all the men were negative for @entity27 and genital herpes ( also known as herpes simplex virus type 2 ) ; a subgroup of men also tested negative for @entity4			0
roughly half of the men underwent medically supervised circumcision at the start of the trial , while the other half were circumcised two years later			2
overall , circumcision reduced the men 's risk of genital herpes by 28 percent ( 10.3 percent of uncircumcised men developed genital herpes compared with 7.8 percent of circumcised men ) and hpv infection by 35 percent ( 27.8 percent of uncircumcised men were infected with @entity4 compared with 18 percent of circumcised men )			1
@entity104 did not , however , protect against syphilis			0
( about 2 percent of men in both groups contracted syphilis			2
) @entity46 : a sexual risk taker comes to terms with drinking , depression , and @entity113 study coauthor @entity114 , @entity115 , professor of global health at @entity76 , says that choosing circumcision , whether it 's the parents of an infant or an adult male for himself , is and should remain an individual decision			1
" but the critics need to really look at the benefits versus the risks , " he adds			0
" by now a large body of evidence has shown that the health benefits clearly outweigh the minor risk associated with the surgery			0
in our study , we did n't see any adverse effects or mutilation			0
we 're recommending supervised , safe , sterile environments -- not circumcision out in an open field with rusty instruments			0
" increasing circumcision rates in @entity34 may not only help men , but would likely protect women too , possibly lowering the rates of female cervical cancer , the authors say			2
@entity143 , @entity115 , professor of public health at @entity76 and study coauthor , says that the researchers plan to look at whether male circumcision reduces the transmission of @entity4 to female sexual partners			1
@entity46 : 10 questions to ask a new partner before having sex even in the @entity10 , this study has relevance , says @entity154 , @entity115 , director of the @entity155 ( which funded one of the trials )			1
" in this country , circumcision for infant boys remains a personal decision for the parents , " he says			2
" this makes us rethink whether doctors should be more aggressive in recommending that it at least be considered			0
if parents say no just because generations before them have said no , they should learn more about the significant health benefits before making that choice			0
" roughly three - quarters of @entity10 adults have had at least one hpv infection , according to an editorial by @entity174 , @entity115 , and @entity175 , @entity115 , both of the @entity176			1
although vaccines against some of the most dangerous hpv strains have been approved for girls ages 13 to 26 , the vaccines are expensive and routine pap tests are still necessary to pick up cervical cancers			0
@entity46 : how to tell your ex you have an @entity113 @entity174 and @entity175 note that " rates of circumcision are declining and are lowest among black and @entity189 patients , groups in whom rates of @entity27 , herpes , and cervical cancer are disproportionately high			1
" @entity195 , which insures many low - income patients in these populations , does not pay for routine infant circumcision in 16 states			0
the study authors hope that this growing evidence in favor of circumcision will persuade policy - making bodies , both in the @entity10 and in other countries , to officially recommend the procedure -- which could make patient education and insurance coverage more likely			1
it 's not clear why circumcision may affect infection rates			2
but the study authors suggest that penile foreskin may provide a moist , favorable environment for herpes and @entity4 to survive and enter cells on the skin 's surface			1
once the foreskin is surgically removed , the risk of infection may be reduced			2
@entity46 : men can lose their sex drives too they also note , however , that male circumcision is not completely effective in preventing sexually transmitted infections			0
safe sex practices , including consistent condom use , are still necessary to provide the best protection			0
