-- @entity2 's follow - up to 2007 's " @entity3 " is an engrossing and brilliantly acted adaptation of @entity6 's play " @entity5 " ( itself based on @entity9 's book " a @entity10 " )			1
it 's centered around the real - life trio of psychiatrists @entity14 ( @entity15 ) , @entity16 ( @entity17 ) and @entity18 ( @entity19 ) , a woman who is at first a patient and later a pioneer in psychoanalysis , herself			1
lacking any of the dark or macabre trappings of many of @entity2 's previous films ( " crash , " " @entity28 " ) , " method " is instead a romantic , bittersweet and ultimately tragic character - driven film , focusing on the deep friendship between @entity14 and @entity16 , as well as both men 's relationship with @entity18			1
our first sight of @entity18 is her being dragged , literally kicking and screaming , out of a carriage and into the @entity39 mental hospital in @entity40 in 1904			0
she was what used to be called a hysteric			0
a non-specific condition attributed almost exclusively to women and based at least in part on the @entity48 word for womb ( hystera ) , it is a diagnosis no longer made , due in part to the work that @entity14 and @entity16 did with @entity18			1
around this time , @entity16 was experimenting with a radical new method of treatment for mental illness that @entity14 had developed , the " talking cure , " which we now refer to as psychoanalysis			0
a young , educated and extremely intelligent woman , @entity18 was the ideal patient for @entity16 to work with and he was soon getting results			2
with a goal towards becoming a doctor , @entity18 is amazed at and relieved by the effect @entity16 's treatment has on her behavior and is intrigued by his methods , even going so far as to basically assist with her own treatment			2
@entity18 is clearly a hyper - intelligent young woman , and watching @entity19 cycle through shame , anger , revelation , arousal and , ultimately , relief is a pleasure			1
@entity18 's collection of tics , shrieks , shudders and fears slowly gives way to a modicum of calm as her treatment progresses and we see the brilliant and curious woman beneath			2
most of those who have used phrases like " over the top " to describe @entity19 's performance have clearly misunderstood the meaning of the word " hysterical			1
" it is actually one of the most controlled performances i 've seen this year			0
@entity18 had endured a childhood rife with corporal punishment and humiliation at the hands of her father , and when @entity16 discovers a sexual element to her condition ( she actually liked the spankings she received but was overcome by shame ) , it was clear to him that he had a case that confirmed @entity14 's theory of an underlying sexual connection to emotional disorders			1
thus begins a correspondence and eventually a strong friendship between the two psychiatrists			1
@entity17 , an actor who is undoubtedly on the cusp of superstardom , delivers a performance as equally brilliant as @entity19 , but his is almost entirely internal			1
@entity16 hides his thoughts behind a psychiatrist 's generally impassive veneer , and thus @entity17 's eventually heartbreaking work on screen is largely one of subtlety			1
when his relationship with @entity18 veers from the professional to the personal , however , his calm exterior begins to crack			2
@entity16 's psychiatric discoveries are framed by the growing relationship between himself and @entity14 as the two men correspond about @entity18 's treatments and other theories			2
@entity15 's @entity14 is the elder statesman , arrogant at times but clearly happy to have an acolyte of such high intellectual ability , and @entity16 is grateful for the attention of the eminent doctor @entity14			2
complicating things is @entity16 's wealthy wife , and the disparity of economic means between the two men is occasionally a bone of contention including the instance of a trip to the @entity142 where @entity16 's wife books him a first class stateroom while @entity14 and his assistant are in lowlier accommodations			0
a bit of an ego blow to the man who invented the concept and their relationship continues to suffer			0
the methods and theories that @entity14 had been advancing were strange and uncomfortable to the psychiatric community , not to mention the general public and having @entity16 as a comrade in arms gave @entity14 intellectual protection when the two functioned as a united front			0
however , once @entity16 began to feel more assured in his own theories and ideas ( including some that could be considered verging on the paranormal ) @entity14 started to resent the younger man 's advances in the field , not to mention having no respect for @entity16 's more esoteric research			0
the other key to the collapse of their professional and personal relationship is @entity16 's sexual relationship with @entity18			1
it is a serious breach of ethics , a betrayal of his wife and , when @entity16 denies it in a letter to @entity14 , a stain on his integrity			0
" @entity5 " is another example of how many true - life stories are out there that can be made into compelling and moving cinema			0
it is a historical drama , a bittersweet romance and the story of a professional friendship - cum - rivalry that gave birth to arguably the greatest advance in the history of mental health			1
@entity2 is a master director at the top of his game , and " @entity5 " is a film where the beauty is in the performances , language and ideas			0
reviewed at the 2011 @entity205 , " @entity5 " is rated @entity206 and contains some less - than - vanilla sexual imagery and situations .			0

watching @entity19 cycle through shame , anger , arousal and relief is a pleasure
@entity17 's eventually heartbreaking work is largely one of subtlety
it 's an historical drama , a romance and the story of a professional friendship
