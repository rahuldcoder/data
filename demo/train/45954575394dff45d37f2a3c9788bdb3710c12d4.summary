according to a new study released by @entity2 , the rich have made tremendous gains in the past several years -- to the point where , analysts predict , by 2016 the world 's wealthiest 1 % will control more than 50 % of the world 's wealth			1
the 80 wealthiest people in the world , alone , own $ 1.9 trillion			2
in the @entity14 , the top 1 % control more than one third of the nation 's resources			1
two out of three @entity14 disapprove of the current distribution of income and wealth			0
they believe that our economy and government unfairly favor the rich			0
one of the major contributors to rising inequality is our tax system			0
raising taxes on the very wealthy is an idea that appeals to many @entity14 , including the middle class and poor			0
in his @entity31 on tuesday night , president @entity30 will attempt to address this serious issue			1
he will propose a set of policies to increase taxes paid by big business and the wealthiest @entity14 and provide tax cuts and credits for @entity14 's middle class			1
prominent economists think that the government needs to raise taxes on corporations and top earners to benefit the nation as a whole			0
republicans , meanwhile , are already apoplectic about president @entity30 's plan			1
one of the more curious phenomena about @entity47 is that their economic agenda is entirely independent of the facts of the moment			2
so when the economy is strong , @entity47 demand tax cuts for the rich			1
when the economy is weak , @entity47 demand tax cuts for the rich			1
when the economy is recovering , @entity47 demand tax cuts for the rich			1
but the massive tax cuts for the wealthy under president @entity62 did n't stave off the recession and arguably precipitated or worsened the fall			2
moreover , the nonpartisan @entity65 has conclusively determined that tax cuts for the rich do not spur economic growth			0
to the contrary , there 's evidence that tax cuts hurt growth			0
in fact , the only thing tax cuts unequivocally do , according to the study ? tax cuts increase economic inequality			2
president @entity30 is also proposing fees to make it more costly for the biggest financial companies to excessively borrow money			1
post-recession , corporate profits have soared , but wages for @entity14 workers have not			0
@entity87 , corporate profits used to correlate more closely with economic growth and wage prosperity for average @entity14			0
in other words , we used to do well all together			0
but increasingly , especially in the past decade thanks to @entity47 tax cuts and deregulations , corporations have succeeded while ordinary @entity14 have fallen behind			2
how else do we explain the stock market hitting record highs while many @entity14 are still out of work ? this runaway train of inequality wo n't solve itself			2
we need government action -- action the majority of @entity14 strongly support			0
in his @entity31 address , president @entity30 will argue for closing the " trust fund loophole , " which , according to the @entity106 , is one of the biggest tax loopholes plaguing our economy and lets the wealthiest @entity14 avoid hundreds of billions in taxes every year , money that should be helping build roads and schools that help us all			1
president @entity30 will also propose raising the top capital gains and dividend rates back to what they were under president @entity119 , which clearly @entity47 once agreed was a sufficient level			1
and to hedge the sort of gambling that puts our entire economy at risk , president @entity30 will propose a fee on the nation 's largest financial firms in proportion to how heavily they borrow and leverage			1
these modest measures will help us reinvest in @entity14 's middle class and strengthen our economy for everyone 's benefit			2
among the president 's proposals is a $ 500 tax credit for second earners in families where both spouses work , a proposal that will benefit 24 million @entity14 families			2
the president will endorse tripling the child care tax benefit , to help 5.1 million @entity14 families cover the cost of child care			0
president @entity30 will provide students with up to $ 2,500 a year toward the cost of college and make the first two years of community college free			1
and president @entity30 's plan includes giving 30 million more workers the opportunity to easily and automatically save for retirement through their employers			1
while @entity14 voters across the board think that @entity160 help the poor , middle class and rich fairly equally , 69 % think @entity47 policies favor the rich			1
even conservative voters are concerned about rising inequality			0
the political pressure is on the @entity47 to prove they 're not just the party of the 1 %			1
there are some encouraging signs that @entity47 believe tax reform should include increasing the share paid by the wealthiest @entity14			2
president @entity30 's plan is a modest and effective set of policies that sensible @entity47 can support			1
the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results			0
we 've cut taxes on big businesses and the rich to near historic lows			0
those tax cuts have only helped corporate profits and yacht sales			0
it 's time that our economic policy helps all @entity14			0
in this economic and political climate , not supporting basic tax fairness is insane .			0

new study indicates that by 2016 , the world 's wealthiest 1 % will control more than 50 % of the world 's wealth
president @entity30 is right in his sotu address to address the *widening* inequality and to propose taxes on the rich
@entity47 need to *recognize* that they ca n't just be the party of the 1 % and support @entity30 's modest proposals
