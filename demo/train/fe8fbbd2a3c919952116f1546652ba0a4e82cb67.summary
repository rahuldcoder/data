-- already hamstrung by generations of poverty , environmental catastrophe and strongman rule , @entity1 will need years to recover from the devastation inflicted by last week 's earthquake , according to @entity9 and @entity10 analysts			1
@entity1 's struggling democracy has survived on international aid and the muscle of a @entity15 peacekeeping mission since a 2004 revolt that ousted president @entity17			1
the magnitude - 7.0 earthquake that struck outside @entity19 has set back efforts to get the country back on its feet " by many , many years , " said @entity23 , a senior fellow at the @entity24 , a @entity25 - based think tank			1
" i do n't think all of it is lost , but it 's a very serious setback , " @entity23 told @entity0			0
president @entity29 's government regrouped at a police compound near the @entity19 airport after nearly all of government ministries suffered heavy damage in the january 12 quake			1
prime minister @entity35 put the confirmed death toll at 72,000 on tuesday , but estimates of the total number of fatalities run more than twice that high			0
@entity40 , who led the @entity42 division of the @entity43 during the @entity45 administration , said much has been done to build a non-corrupt police force and judiciary over the past six years			1
" of the administration and sort of on the institutional side , i think a lot can be salvaged , " said @entity40 , now senior vice president at the @entity48			2
but he said efforts to redevelop @entity1 's long - ravaged economy may have been set back by " decades			1
" @entity53 : search list of the missing and the found @entity1 's public infrastructure -- roads , power and sanitation systems , hospitals and schools -- was already in poor condition before the earthquake			1
the flimsy homes built across @entity19 collapsed wholesale during the quake , and hospitals quickly ran out of medicine			2
clogged roads , damaged communications and airport congestion slowed the delivery of the hundreds of millions of dollars worth of international aid pledged in the week after the disaster , leading to widespread frustration and sporadic looting around the capital			1
once the challenges of feeding , housing and treating hundreds of thousands of ill , homeless and hungry people are behind them , @entity40 said , @entity1 from all walks of society need to reach a new " social compact " aimed at ending its persistent problems			2
" the mismanagement of the environment ; the narrow , self - interested actions of the economic elite that deny taxes to the government so they ca n't provide education to the population ; the failure to establish government agencies that can provide services -- all those things are not the consequences of natural disasters , but they make the country more vulnerable when disasters hit , " he said			0
though its economy has grown in recent years , @entity1 is still the poorest country in the @entity105 , with four - fifths of its 10 million people living in poverty			1
its gross domestic product of $ 12 billion in 2008 is a tiny fraction compared to the $ 14 trillion generated by the @entity9 , its largest trading partner			0
in addition , years of deforestation has left a mountainous country in the middle of the @entity42 's hurricane belt vulnerable to flooding and mudslides , like the ones that killed thousands in 2004			2
and poor construction left unknown thousands of people trapped in buildings that pancaked when the earth moved last week , said @entity124 , a professor of earth and environmental sciences at @entity127 in @entity128			0
full coverage l @entity131 updates stricter building codes and honest enforcement are necessary , but " people will never be able to build strong , expensive structures if they do n't have a strong economy , " @entity124 told @entity0 's " @entity137			2
" " the economy of @entity1 can not put @entity19 back in place , " he said			1
" it 's a perfect storm			0
it absolutely needs external intervention from the international community			0
we have to think of what we 're doing			0
" @entity1 's governmental budget of about $ 1 billion per year is derived largely from customs fees and is wholly inadequate for the physical improvements needed , @entity23 said			1
emigres send back more money than that every year , but that money goes to individual families , not to public projects			0
" the international community has been pressing the @entity1 government to put more stock in taxation , but in fact , the real taxation that 's taking place are the remittances , " @entity23 said			1
" it 's a form of taxation , family to family , friend to friend			0
" but @entity40 said the influx of reconstruction aid could be an opportunity for @entity1 to rebuild its infrastructure with more concern for its environment -- and to create jobs for @entity1 in its construction			1
" that 's the way you employ a lot of @entity1 , " he said			2
reconstruction contracts should require " both jobs and job training			0
" high - resolution images of damage the @entity9 has been heavily involved in @entity1 commercially , politically and militarily for most of the last century , including occupying the country for nearly 20 years in the early 1900s			2
the @entity45 administration restored @entity17 to power in 1994 after a 1991 coup , and a @entity9 jet hustled him out of the country again in 2004 following a rapidly spreading uprising against his government			0
@entity17 has called his removal a @entity9 - backed coup , an allegation @entity195 denied			0
now the @entity9 is the largest contributor to the @entity1 government , while @entity10 -- which also has a police contingent in @entity1 as part of the @entity15 peacekeeping mission @entity200 -- is the second - largest			1
@entity0 's @entity202 contributed to this report .			0

@entity206 set back efforts to get @entity1 back on its feet " by many , many years , " analyst says
@entity1 's democracy survived after ' 04 revolt with aid , @entity15 peacekeeping mission
@entity48 *official* : efforts to build non-corrupt institutions can be salvaged
professor : @entity1 economy can not rebuild @entity19 , so international aid needed
