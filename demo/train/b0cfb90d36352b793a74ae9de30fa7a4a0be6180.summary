monday morning , february 9 , was my last morning at the hospital ; in just a few hours i would be headed for the airport			1
we held an appreciation program with breakfast for all the @entity8 staff after our morning chapel gathering , to recognize those who had served so courageously during the worst of the @entity12 crisis			1
along with @entity15 ( @entity14 ) @entity13 , our medical director , i was asked to say a few words			1
as i spoke , thanking our nurses , midwives , aides and cleaners for coming to work during the toughest times in august , september and october , my mind went back to a meeting with health care planners from an international nongovernmental organization			1
they wanted to know : " what allowed @entity8 to remain open when other hospitals closed ? " the health system collapse was one of the greatest unanticipated consequences of the @entity12 epidemic			1
it led to many deaths due to malaria or obstructed labor or pneumonia : illnesses that have nothing to do with @entity12 , but which went untreated because hospitals and clinics were closed			1
@entity8 was one of the bright spots , remaining open and caring for the sick through the most difficult months of the crisis			1
also on monday morning , we discharged little @entity50 ( not his real name ) from the hospital			1
@entity50 , a 5 - week - old , had come in about 12 days earlier with severe vomiting			2
he could n't keep anything down			2
he was hungry and was breastfeeding vigorously , but after every feeding he would vomit all of it up			2
he was n't making dirty diapers any more			2
he had lost weight and become dehydrated			2
one of our doctors suggested he might have pyloric stenosis , a thickening of the muscle around the outlet of the stomach into the small intestine , which leads to blockage of the flow of nutrition			2
the best test for pyloric stenosis is an ultrasound exam , and i 've developed reasonable ultrasound skills over many years of scanning and learning on the job			2
i went to the office and found our big two - volume ultrasound text , and read about pyloric stenosis			0
with the ultrasound machine , you can measure the thickness of the muscle in the pyloric canal ( the outlet of the stomach ) to confirm the diagnosis			0
as i scanned little @entity50 , one of my colleagues joked with me about doing the scan with the ultrasound in one hand and my textbook in the other			0
i told him this was not the first time i would be doing this , nor would it be the last			0
we got some clear images showing that little @entity50 did indeed have pyloric stenosis and would require surgery			0
@entity100 has blessed @entity101 with some truly gifted staff			0
@entity13 , our medical director , is one of the few residency trained surgeons in the country			1
we also have some highly qualified anesthetists , one of whom is especially skilled handling infants			0
so after coordinating the schedules of all the staff who were needed , the child had a successful operation about four days after admission			1
as we monitored @entity50 through his recovery , i realized we were one of only a few institutions in @entity117 that could pull together the resources to successfully diagnose and operate on this little baby			1
after the surgery , little @entity50 improved quickly			0
he nursed voraciously and started gaining weight			0
his mom and dad were so relieved			0
finally , on my last day in the country , he would be going home ! this takes me back to the question that was asked by the visiting international health care coordinators			0
after the reopening of the hospital on august 6 , how did @entity101 manage to stay open when other facilities were having repeated closures ? as i see it , there are two reasons : the first is that our staff are mission driven			1
they are motivated by the example of @entity141 and his call to care for their neighbors who are in need ; their belief in @entity100 is no mere intellectual assent or religious ritual , but real , where - the - rubber - meets - the - road faith that strengthened them to do this difficult and fearful work and leave the results to @entity100			1
the second answer has to do with little @entity50			0
when you put all the pieces of the puzzle together , you can accomplish so much more than any one of you could accomplish on your own			0
that synergy , the teamwork that results in the ability to give a couple back their baby , who surely would have died otherwise , makes the work so satisfying			1
this , too , can motivate people to come to work , when they know they are a critical piece of the puzzle that saves lives .			0
