-- @entity3 ' first @entity2 derby ended in crushing defeat sunday as his @entity6 team suffered an embarrassing 4 - 1 loss away to @entity9 title rival @entity8			1
@entity3 , facing the immense task in replacing @entity11 -- the most successful manager in @entity14 football history -- could only watch as @entity8 netted four times in the first 50 minutes against the defending champion			1
@entity17 scored the first and third , @entity18 made it 2 - 0 in first - half injury time and @entity20 put the result beyond doubt			1
it lifted @entity8 up to third in the table , with new manager @entity26 vindicated in restoring @entity27 to the starting lineup as the @entity30 striker set up two of the goals			1
@entity3 was robbed of the services of last season 's top scorer @entity34 , who was ruled out with a groin injury , and @entity37 was unable to continue the resurgent form he has shown up front this season until he curled in a stunning free - kick in the 87th minute			1
" every manager has bad days and bad results			2
i am no different , " @entity3 said			2
" i have been here with @entity46 many times and i do n't think i suffered a defeat like this with @entity46			2
" i talked with the players the same as i would at any other club			0
they are good pros here and they know when they are bang at it and when they are not			0
" while the result echoed @entity8 's 6 - 1 thumping of @entity6 at @entity60 two years ago , which gave @entity62 's men a five - point cushion at the top on the way to a long - awaited league title , this time the victory has merely kept the @entity68 in touch with leading sides @entity70 and @entity71			1
the @entity73 clubs ended this weekend with a two - point advantage after @entity70 beat @entity75 3 - 1 , with record signing @entity76 having a hand in all three goals , and @entity71 edged @entity80 1 - 0 thanks to an injury - time winner from @entity83			1
@entity6 , meanwhile , dropped to eighth in the table with just seven points from five matches -- five behind the top two			1
@entity3 ' team also lost to @entity89 and drew with @entity90 in a difficult run of early fixtures			0
" the start to the season could be a lot better , " the @entity93 said			0
" we did say it could be a difficult start			0
" i was n't convinced when the balls came out of the @entity9 bag ( for the schedule ) and i 'm still not convinced			2
" @entity26 was understandably pleased with his best result since leaving @entity105 club @entity104 at the end of last season			0
" i 'm very happy			0
the way we played is the way i want this team to play , very similar to against @entity111 ( a 4 - 0 win )			1
we played the way we work all week , " the @entity113 said			0
" we have been playing irregular in other games , but it is normal in this moment of the season			0
this was a high test today and the players had a great answer			0
" @entity17 put @entity8 ahead in the 16th minute as the @entity124 striker superbly hooked in a volley from @entity127 's left - wing cross , with @entity20 also involved in the move			1
@entity18 pounced for the vital second just before the break , sticking out a knee to divert the ball into the net after @entity27 rose highest to head down a corner			2
@entity27 , signed for $ 26 million from @entity135 in july , was again the provider just a minute after the restart as he turned and put in the perfect cross for @entity17 to volley home a much simpler effort than his first			2
@entity20 was criticized for his performance in last season 's corresponding fixture , a tempestuous 3 - 2 defeat for @entity8 marred by pitch invasions and coin throwing , but he has been a different player this campaign			1
the @entity149 midfielder calmly volleyed in the fourth goal at the far post from a cross by @entity153 -- another new addition to @entity8 's squad -- after captain @entity156 stopped a @entity6 attack and charged upfield			1
@entity37 is also in significantly better form this season , having flirted with a move to @entity90 but now seemingly committed to @entity6			1
the @entity163 striker 's late corner allowed @entity164 to head against the post , and soon after he gave @entity8 keeper @entity165 no chance with his fourth goal in the last three matches			1
@entity70 's victory was the club 's seventh in a row since losing 3 - 1 at home to @entity174 on the opening day of this season			1
manager @entity176 hailed the contribution of @entity178 playmaker @entity76 , who has settled in quickly since leaving @entity179 on transfer deadline day			0
" once he is completely integrated we will see even more of him , but he has shown today that he is a great player , " said @entity176 said			0
" @entity76 is a player , when you look at his numbers , the assists are not a coincidence , it is just the reality of his game			0
" you could see today he has a good pace as well			0
at the moment he focuses a lot on his passing , but he can create individually as well			0
" @entity71 needed a moment of magic from @entity83 , one of several new signings , as the @entity199 midfielder backheeled the winner at @entity80 from @entity202 's pass			2
" there could only be one winner , " said @entity71 coach @entity203			0
" we played so much football it would have been unfair to leave here with only one point			0
" in sunday 's other match , @entity210 moved up to ninth with a 2 - 0 win at promoted @entity214 , which stayed second from bottom			1
bottom club @entity216 sacked coach @entity217 on sunday , following a 3 - 0 defeat against @entity219 24 hours earlier			1
the @entity220 was a controversial appointment on march 31 due to his past statements in support of fascism , but he kept the club in the top flight in 17th place			2
however , @entity216 has just one point from five games this season .			0

@entity8 wins 4 - 1 in sunday 's derby match against @entity6
@entity17 scores twice , with @entity18 and @entity20 also on target
@entity37 nets late *consolation* for @entity6 in *absence* of @entity34
@entity70 top of @entity9 table on goal difference after 3 - 1 win over @entity75
