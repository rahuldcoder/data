-- civil rights activist @entity1 made famous the phrase , " i 'm sick and tired of being sick and tired			2
" for me , i 'm sick and tired of @entity4 having power and being unwilling to use it			0
i 've always respected @entity7 when they had power because they were willing to use it and maybe apologize later			1
today , president @entity10 walked into the @entity12 briefing room and took some questions , and one of them revolved around recess appointments			1
he has watched @entity7 block many of his appointments , and now he says he made it clear to them that he will " consider " making some when the @entity20 goes into recess			1
" one senator , as you all are aware , had put a hold on every single nominee that we had put forward due to a dispute over a couple of earmarks in his state , " president @entity10 said			1
" in our meeting , i asked the congressional leadership to put a stop to these holds in which nominees for critical jobs are denied a vote for months			2
surely we can set aside partisanship and do what 's traditionally been done to confirm these nominations			0
if the @entity20 does not act -- and i made this very clear -- if the @entity20 does not act to confirm these nominees , i will consider making several recess appointments during the upcoming recess , because we ca n't afford to allow politics to stand in the way of a well - functioning government			1
" this is where the president needs to show his toughness and just do it			0
the actions of sen. @entity56 , @entity57 , and other @entity7 obstructionists will continue if president @entity10 allows them to run roughshod over him			1
when you 're the top dog , you do what you have to do to govern			0
allowing @entity7 senators to continue to deny your appointments is nonsense			1
if all of them choose to support a filibuster , then you take it to the @entity68 people and show the obstructionists for what they are			0
you get your grass - roots movement fired up to stand up and do something			0
the political right used its base to go after @entity4 who blocked appointments to the federal bench and other positions			1
so why not be just as aggressive ? if there are members of your own party who stand in the way , such as sen. @entity83 , @entity84 , then you also blast them and make them pay for acting so foolishly			2
this president got rolled by the @entity20 over health care			0
his team made some boneheaded mistakes , and now they are paying for them			0
continuing to play footsie with opponents will only get him into more trouble			0
he should set a deadline to have his folks confirmed			0
if not , appoint them all during the recess and go on about your business			2
@entity10 's critics keep blasting him for @entity101 - style politics			1
channel your inner @entity102 and go gangsta against your foes			0
let ' em know that if they are n't with you , they are against you , and will pay the price			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity110 .			1

@entity110 says @entity10 should n't put up with senators who are holding him up
@entity7 has blocked @entity10 appointments ; @entity110 says he should go around it
@entity110 says @entity10 should n't " consider " recess appointments , he should make them
