@entity0 -- @entity2 calls herself an aspiring @entity4 citizen who is compiling the paperwork and trying to get the $ 465 needed to apply for a two - year reprieve from getting deported			1
@entity7 says his superiors at @entity9 are threatening to suspend him for putting an arrested illegal immigrant into the hearing process that could lead to deportation			2
the two are on opposite sides of a lawsuit filed this week by @entity7 and nine other @entity9 agents that challenges a new @entity18 administration policy intended to remove the threat of deportation faced by young illegal immigrants who arrived in @entity4 as children and have good student or military records			1
@entity7 and his fellow complainants argue the new policy on immigration law enforcement exceeds the administration 's authority and puts @entity9 agents in the position of facing disciplinary action for doing their jobs			1
" they 're in a position now that 's just untenable , " argued @entity35 of @entity36 , an advocacy group for more restrictive immigration that is bankrolling the lawsuit			1
the goal of the lawsuit is to force a court ruling on whether the new administration policy is legal , @entity35 told @entity1 on friday			1
if so , then the @entity9 agents are protected ; and if not , the case would halt what the former journalist called a harmful influx of illegal workers at a time when young @entity4 are struggling to find jobs			1
" obviously , we would not be pleased if they say this is a legal order , " @entity35 said , adding : " we do believe strongly that the president does n't have the right to do this			2
" @entity2 and others reject the premise of the lawsuit , calling it a politically motivated effort to undermine the " deferred action " directive by @entity65 secretary @entity64 that went into full effect last week			2
" i think they 're using this as a political plan to rally the voters in election season , " said @entity2 , the political director of @entity68 we dream , an advocacy group for young illegal immigrants like herself			1
a statement by @entity78 president @entity77 said the lawsuit lacked a sound legal basis , noting that " over 100 of the nation 's top constitutional and immigration law scholars signed on to a letter " attesting to the constitutionality of the new administration policy			1
@entity77 's statement added that the suing agents " are working with some of the most anti-immigrant forces in the country ; forces that have long sowed division and destruction			2
" the agents are represented by @entity94 , the @entity96 @entity95 secretary of state who worked on @entity98 's controversial immigration law and is an informal adviser to presumed @entity96 presidential nominee @entity100 , according to @entity36			1
@entity1 senior legal analyst @entity101 said friday that the lawsuit lacked legal merit			1
" i ca n't imagine any judge would even give them standing to file the case , much less decide it on the merits , " @entity101 said			1
" i am unaware of any law that allows federal employees to challenge the legality of the actions of their superiors			2
" filed thursday in federal court in @entity116 , the lawsuit challenges the two - year deferred action policy of the @entity18 administration , as well the policy of " prosecutorial discretion , " in which @entity9 agents are supposed to focus their attention on dangerous criminals who are illegal immigrants			1
in a nutshell , the agents involved do not want to obey the new policies and do not want to face any disciplinary actions or lawsuits if they continue to arrest any type of immigrant who is in the @entity4 illegally			1
" we are federal law enforcement officers who are being ordered to break the law , " said @entity132 , one of the agents filing suit and the president of the @entity9 agents and officers union			2
" this directive puts @entity9 agents and officers in a horrible position			2
" according to the lawsuit , @entity7 " arrested an alien who was unlawfully present in the @entity4 and issued the alien an @entity145 ( notice to appear ) , contrary to the general directions of his supervisors that he should decline to issue @entity149 to certain illegal aliens			1
" " @entity153 was issued a notice of @entity155 , " the lawsuit says			0
" @entity153 is facing a three - day suspension for arresting and processing the alien for a hearing rather than exercising the ' prosecutorial discretion ' commanded by his supervisors			0
@entity153 requested a written directive ordering him not to issue the @entity145			0
his supervisors have refused to give him a written directive and would not sign any paperwork authorizing the use of ' prosecutorial discretion			0
' " now , the lawsuit says , @entity7 " reasonably fears , based on his past experience , that if he follows the requirements of federal law , contrary to the ' @entity172 , ' and arrests an alien or issues the alien an @entity145 , he will be disciplined again			0
he reasonably fears that a second disciplinary action will result in the loss of his job			0
" @entity177 , a spokesman for the @entity65 , responded thursday that the department " uses prosecutorial discretion to assist in focusing vigorously on the removal of individuals who are convicted criminals , repeat immigration law violators , and recent border - crossers			0
" in fiscal year 2011 , @entity9 removed 216,000 criminal illegal immigrants , @entity177 said , adding that it was the largest annual figure in history and an 89 % increase over the administration of president @entity190			1
the @entity192 decision is a temporary measure until @entity194 takes action on reforming immigration policies , @entity177 continued , adding that it " ensures that responsible young people , who are @entity4 in every way but on paper , have an opportunity to remain in the country and make their fullest contribution			1
" @entity2 , who came to @entity4 with her parents from @entity204 at the age of 8 , described herself in similar terms			2
she graduated from @entity207 and now wants to get a master 's degree , she said			0
" we speak the language			0
we are part of the fabric of this nation , " she said			0
" this is my home			0
they are telling me that i do not belong , that i am not @entity4			2
" president @entity18 made a similar point in announcing the policy change in june , calling the decision to halt deportations of people like @entity2 " the right thing to do			2
" under the new policy , the @entity18 administration will give a two - year deferral from deportation to illegal immigrants who entered the @entity4 as children if they are younger than 30 , arrived in the country before the age of 16 , pose no criminal or security threat , and were successful students or served in the military			1
supporters stress the plan does not grant immunity or provide a shortcut to citizenship , but instead affords undocumented immigrant children a chance to be productive workers while removing the threat of deportation for two years			0
opponents say the policy amounts to granting backdoor amnesty to people who came to @entity4 illegally and tightening an already poor job market for young @entity4			1
as many as 1.7 million youths may qualify for the program , according to the @entity251 , a project of the @entity251			0
the deferred deportation policy includes some of the provisions of a @entity256 proposal called the @entity257 that failed to win enough @entity96 support to become law			0
@entity18 made clear that the new policy was intended to be a temporary step until @entity194 passes a more comprehensive immigration law that addresses the situation of young illegal immigrants who have essentially grown up as @entity4			1
@entity35 called such an approach misguided			0
" we 're going to do something that 's not allowed by law in order to get @entity194 to pass something which they have defeated repeatedly , " he said			0
" it 's just such an abuse of power			0
" his group raised $ 100,000 for the lawsuit thursday , @entity35 said , adding that he expected the case to cost " a few hundred thousand dollars			0
" " if it goes to the @entity278 , who knows ? " he added			0
@entity1 's @entity280 and @entity281 contributed to this report .			0

ten immigration agents challenge the administration over halting some deportations
legal analyst @entity101 : the lawsuit has no legal standing
at issue is a move to allow children of illegal immigrants to study and work in @entity4
