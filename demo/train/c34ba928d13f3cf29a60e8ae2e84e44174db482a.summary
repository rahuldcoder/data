@entity0 , @entity1 -- when i speak to college students , i always push two messages : if you work hard , take risks , leave your comfort zone and never give up , you can do anything you want to in life ; and part of life is competition , because no matter what you want , you can bet that someone else wants it too			1
a simple concept and a beneficial one			2
it makes us better by forcing us to work harder			2
sadly , it 's also an idea that is going out of style in a society where students expect to get good grades just for showing up , where everyone gets a ribbon no matter where they finish , and where parents scheme to get their kids into college by lobbying state legislatures to create set - asides for in - state residents at public universities			2
when we 're not hiding from domestic competition , we 're trying to shield ourselves from the foreign variety			1
high - skilled workers do n't want to compete with those from @entity43 , @entity44 or @entity45			1
low - skilled workers are just as afraid of those from @entity47 , @entity48 or @entity49			1
politicians only make matters worse			1
while @entity53 exploit the immigration issue , @entity52 do the same thing with trade			2
in last year 's @entity52 presidential primary , @entity57 and @entity58 tried to give displaced workers in @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 a convenient villain to blame -- the @entity65			1
both parties use lies and demagoguery to exploit fears and convince frightened @entity70 that we can fence ourselves off from competition			1
all so we do n't have to put up with the annoyance of being forced to out - work , out - produce and out - hustle someone else to make a living			0
what people in other countries accept as the natural order , we continue to resist			0
what our own parents and grandparents came to expect decades ago when they went after a job , we think we 're above			0
we 've come to think that competition is cruel because there are winners and losers ; so we spend all our time devising new ways to minimize the losing			1
our elected officials should inspire us to be better people , and to learn to accept competition as part of life			1
instead , most of them are too busy telling us what we want to hear so we 'll like them better and buy whatever they 're selling at the moment			0
consider what rep. @entity106 , @entity107 , is pitching			0
he has just written a new 10 - point immigration reform bill that he plans to introduce any day now			0
in addition to providing a pathway to legalize 12 million illegal immigrants , @entity106 proposes to manage future immigrant flow by establishing a commission that ties foreign visas to labor market demand			1
" here 's the guiding principle , " @entity106 said on @entity119 's " @entity117 with @entity118 " in explaining the rationale for his bill			0
" no @entity70 worker , no citizen of the @entity70 , no one born here in this country should ever have to lose an opportunity for gainful employment at the expense of someone not born here			1
" as principles go , that one is dreadful			0
@entity106 's bill has some good things in it , but it also has some things we could do without			0
a commission that protects @entity70 workers from competing with foreigners belongs in the second category			1
why should " no one born here in this country ... ever lose an opportunity for gainful employment at the expense of someone not born here ? " remember , these are n't illegal immigrants but legal immigrants coming on visas			1
why should @entity70 citizens get a benefit not from education or hard work but from something they had nothing to do with -- where they were born ? if a job is available , @entity70 workers should be free to compete for it , but not have it handed to them on a silver platter			1
likewise , foreign workers who come here legally should have a shot at competing for that same job			2
of course , protectionists claim that the playing field is n't level since foreign workers will often accept less money to do the same job , thus putting @entity70 workers at a disadvantage			1
president @entity174 had it right			0
at a press conference in march 1962 , while fielding a question about military reservists who were upset at being mobilized and deployed to @entity178 and @entity179 , @entity174 made the point that there is no level playing field -- not ever			0
" there is always inequity in life , " he said			2
" some men are killed in a war , and some men are wounded , and some men never leave the country , and some men are stationed in the @entity193 , and some are stationed in @entity195			0
it 's very hard in military or in personal life to assure complete equality			2
bad news , rep. @entity106			0
how sad that our current crop of elected leaders has strayed so far from such straight talk			0
instead , they coddle us and make us comfortable with our fears -- all so we 'll keep re-electing them			0
that way , they do n't have to go into the private sector and compete for jobs with the rest of us			0
you see , our aversion to competition starts at the top			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223			1

competition is a fact of life , says @entity223
he says some are seeking to protect @entity70 workers even from legal immigrants
@entity223 : politicians should stop trying to insulate @entity70 workers from *reality* of competition
