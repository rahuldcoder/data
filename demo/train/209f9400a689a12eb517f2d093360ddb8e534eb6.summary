the two remain deeply embedded in @entity7 popular culture , inspiring references in everything from a @entity11 sketch to " @entity12			1
" that dress reveals @entity1 's resilience , resourcefulness and survival instinct -- traits that may explain the enduring popularity of @entity21 's @entity20 romance novel and its blockbuster movie adaptation			1

the @entity58 archives contain a voluminous collection from the producer , whose sons donated more than 5,000 document boxes of material to the research library and museum in 1980			0
" that was his management style , " @entity35 says of @entity67 's famous memos that detail his thinking over the three - plus years he struggled to bring the movie to the screen			2
" it 's good for us			0
" " the making of ' @entity31 ' " covers the behind - the - scenes drama that included the search for an unknown to play @entity1 , constant script revisions , the comings and goings of directors , concerns over the authenticity of @entity105 accents , censorship problems , and controversy over the portrayal of @entity7 characters			1
" race is absolutely at the center of the film , " says @entity116 , associate professor in the @entity117 of @entity118 at the @entity30 who was a faculty adviser to the exhibit			2
" it 's really shaped how people think about the @entity105 and the memories of the @entity20 and @entity126 , " he says , noting that it 's " outdated at best , terribly racist at its worst			0
" " its version of history is compromised , " he adds			0
opinion : how slavery haunts today 's @entity134 controversies over race , historical accuracy @entity67 faced pressures over racial issues almost from the beginning , receiving letters from people concerned about the depiction of happy and subservient slaves			0
@entity146 official @entity145 urged the producer to name an @entity7 adviser to ensure the film 's historical accuracy , but @entity67 resisted , feeling he already had too many advisers			1
a blistering editorial in the @entity153 , a prominent @entity7 newspaper , criticized the film 's script for including the n - word , predicting it would be worse than " @entity158			1
" facing pressure from the black press , his staff and movie censors , @entity67 decided to remove " the hate word , " @entity35 says			2
" if that word had been in the film , we would be so embarrassed and offended by it that we would n't be discussing the film today , " he says			0
@entity67 also eliminated references from the movie that were in the novel regarding the @entity172 -- specifically when @entity1 gets attacked in an area known as @entity174			2
in a memo to screenwriter @entity176 , he explained that he had " no desire to produce any @entity179 film			0
" in spite of those changes , " @entity183 " remains racially problematic for audiences today , says @entity184 , another faculty adviser to the exhibit			1
still , @entity184 says she finds it valuable to show the movie to students in her film classes at the @entity30			1
when her students see the racial bigotry " they physically recoil , " the assistant professor says			0
" it 's a good reminder			0
" @entity184 , an admitted fan of the film since childhood , calls it " a complicated movie " that also deals with gender , class and regionalism as well as the @entity20 and race			0
" it brings up a little discomfort in a very beautiful @entity206 package			0

" the story of the making of ' @entity31 ' is the story of the @entity224 , more than the issue of the @entity20 , " he says			1
" a lot of these issues that concerned @entity1 also concerned the public			0
" he says many of the letters @entity67 received came from fans pleading to be cast as @entity1 , not because they wanted to be famous , but because they identified so strongly with her			0
" @entity31 " is still considered the top movie moneymaker of all time when adjusted for inflation , and the novel is second in popularity only to the @entity236 , according to a 2014 @entity237			1
but it 's unclear whether @entity1 will retain her hold over popular audiences in the 21st century			0
