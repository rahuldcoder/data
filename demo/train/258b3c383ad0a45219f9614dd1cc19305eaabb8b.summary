-- it was an eerie night on the @entity2			0
the ocean , which is almost never still , was so calm that some stars could be seen reflected in the water			0
thousands of stars curtained the sky -- backdrop to the immense human drama taking place			0
a great ship was sinking slowly into the freezing sea			2
its 2,200 passengers and crew were facing desperate choices : should i try for the lifeboats ? is that the right thing to do ? and if i do manage to find a place in one , should i try to rescue other people ? about 1,500 people died that night			0
none of the rest survive today			0
but the titanic disaster has never faded from the world 's imagination			1
that was 100 years ago : april 14 to 15 , 1912			1
earlier this year , the @entity31 struck a reef in the @entity33 , just a few feet from a resort island close to the @entity36 mainland			0
fortunately , less than 1 % of its 4,000 passengers died			0
the sinking of the @entity40 and the wreck of the @entity31 had very little in common			1
and survivors of the january incident themselves have made the comparison , with at least one quoted as saying that it felt like " the same type of deal			0
" why ? why does the @entity40 continue to be what flashes into people 's minds whenever the word " disaster " comes up ? it is virtually the only disaster that is perpetually remembered , commemorated , and even celebrated			1
the answer has to do with the drama of choice , not with the brute facts of the disaster itself			0
in 1865 , the @entity63 , a @entity65 riverboat , exploded and burned , with the loss of many more than 1,500 lives			1
in 1915 , the liner lusitania was torpedoed by a @entity70 submarine ; 1,200 people died			0
in the same year , the steamer @entity72 capsized in the @entity74 , killing 840 passengers			1
( ironically , the ship had been overloaded with lifeboats , but they were useless , because the @entity72 sank immediately after people boarded it			1
) frightful events , and each with its own importance			0
but almost no one remembers the @entity63 or the @entity72			1
and no one on the @entity31 is reported to have said , " this is just like the @entity72 ; it 's the same type of deal			1
" as for the @entity90 : it is remembered only as a cause of @entity93 's entry into @entity94 it would be hard to find anyone who recalled a single thing that happened on the @entity90 's decks			1
that is not because popular movies have been made about the @entity40 but not about the @entity90			1
a good movie could not be made about the @entity90 itself because its sinking , like the other disasters i just mentioned , was only a scene of horror			1
it was not , like the @entity40 , an event of permanent dramatic interest			1
the @entity40 sank in two hours and 40 minutes , the length of a classic play			1
its cast of characters included people of every rank and station and personality			2
the cast was large enough to represent the human race , yet small enough to form a self - contained society , in which individuals could see what other individuals were doing , and think carefully about their own responses			2
the @entity40 had what every great drama needs : a relentless focus on the supreme choices of individual lives			2
other disasters were either too big or too small to develop this kind of interest			0
they happened too fast , or too slowly			0
the great @entity135 in 1871 and the @entity137 earthquake and fire in 1906 were tides of destruction rolling for days across large , unfocused landscapes			0
today they are remembered not as dramas of individual men and women but as tests of their cities ' ability to survive the forces of nature			0
by contrast , the @entity90 , the @entity63 , and the @entity72 were destroyed in just minutes			1
there was no time for people to assess their options ; to consider what they could do , or what they should do , morally			0
there was no time to think about whether to take the first seat in a lifeboat or give it to someone else ; to reflect on one 's life and decide how to face its end			2
there was no time for an elderly couple , like the @entity40 's @entity168 and @entity169 , to decide to refuse their places in a lifeboat , and stay together , facing certain death			1
there was no time for someone like @entity177 , head of the company that operated the @entity40 , to remain on deck , trying to help the rescue effort , then suddenly decide to abandon ship			2
there was no time to develop the sometimes inspiring , sometimes disheartening , but always memorable scenes of human life that the titanic disaster continues to present			2
only one other disaster is like the @entity40 : september 11 , 2001			2
the events of 9/11 unfolded over a similar length of time and involved communities of similarly diverse people , involved in unforgettable moments of truth			0
the heroic resistance of the passengers of @entity197 and the courage of the firefighters in the @entity200 are only two scenes from this great human drama			0
the @entity40 and 9/11 -- these disasters , these two , will continue to be remembered , not for their horror , but for what they teach us about the drama , and the dignity , of real people making the ultimate decisions of their lives			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .			2

@entity216 : the sinking of the @entity40 100 years ago still holds the world 's imagination
@entity216 : @entity63 riverboat blast , the sinking of @entity90 and @entity72 are *n't* as *gripping*
@entity229 stories of courage , morality , the cast of characters make titanic unique , he says
@entity216 says the only other catastrophe that will live on in memory like the @entity40 is 9/11
