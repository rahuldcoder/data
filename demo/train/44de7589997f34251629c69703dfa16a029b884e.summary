-- what did you do this summer ? @entity3 stayed busy on campus and now has 40 times as many students and more than 10 times the colleges using their freemium , open - source digital textbooks as they did spring semester			1
and they did it the old - fashioned way -- one professor at a time			2
a company is offering digital alternatives to traditional college textbooks			1
after a sort of beta earlier this year , @entity18 was set to announce thursday that more than 40,000 college students at 400 colleges will use their digital , @entity17 - free textbooks fall semester , up from 1,000 in 30 colleges in the spring			1
digital textbooks remain a nascent business and a tough market to enter			1
at an average cost of $ 100 , textbooks command the highest cover prices in publishing , outside of only some art and coffee - table books			1
demand is artificially inelastic as students are indentured to cost servitude at the whim of college professors who blithely assign titles a student must own if she hopes to do well in a given course			0
now , multiply that by four , five or even six courses a semester and you are talking big bucks			0
by comparison , @entity18 has a pricing scheme that starts at zero for online access using a browser , and $ 20 for a @entity50 , which they believe will be the most popular format			1
printed versions of their textbooks cost up to $ 60			1
perhaps best of all : textbooks are available a @entity59 , chapter by chapter			2
but the key buy - in has been from teachers who make the assignments and who , in my college days , could not care less how much the textbooks cost			1
what 's changed ? " there has been a mind shift , " co-founder @entity69 told @entity70			0
a tipping point came a couple of years ago when faculty began to consider the financial burden on students because many of them ( @entity69 estimates a third ) did n't bother to get the textbook at all			2
perhaps more to the point , open - source textbooks -- which are @entity81 - licensed to allow unencumbered non-commercial use -- make it possible to graft supporting material to the curriculum , rather than the other way around			1
" faculty are notorious for wanting to do things their way , " said @entity69			0
" but they always had to cut the foot to fit the shoe			0
now , with open source , they can cut the shoe to fit the foot			0
" there is virtually no friction involved			0
a professor can register on @entity18 's site and let students know that the book is available there			0
no cooperation from a school district or college administration is required			0
" every single class is a fiefdom , and they are kings and queens of their domain , " @entity69 jokes			0
like any freemium retailer , @entity18 depends on enough people buying something , because clearly the business can not be sustained if everyone just opts for free web access			1
" what we 're counting on is that people will be willing to pay for different packaging			0
" and it will come down to the price points , @entity69 acknowledges , even when the company develops formats for the @entity128 e-book reader and @entity129 , as they hope to this year			2
it makes as much sense to equip students with a device that makes all their reference materials available on demand as to offer a casual reader a complete portable library -- perhaps more			0
this is a classic chicken - and - egg scenario in which a device - dependent culture needs to evolve alongside new content formats			2
for this and a variety of other reasons , including the cost of e-readers and for the media they serve up , @entity69 thinks the @entity50 will remain the format of choice for students for some time to come ( and the ubiquitous and @entity17 - free @entity50 is readable on the @entity128 and @entity129 devices , anyway )			1
" they 'll move forward , " @entity69 says of device - specific e-reader formats			2
" but there is so much irrational pricing right now that they 'll move forward much more slowly than they probably should			0
" for now , expect a @entity50 revolution			2
