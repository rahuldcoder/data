-- while sen. @entity3 has campaigned on a message of hope , his wife , @entity1 , has talked about the realities of @entity8 life -- the gaps between rich and poor , black and white			1
sen. @entity3 has spoken out against criticism of his wife , @entity1			1
she 's publicly criticized the @entity12 as " guided by fear " and " just downright mean			2
" the woman known as " the rock " in the @entity3 family will now appear before the @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19 , on monday -- and before the world -- with a clear message : " @entity22			1
" but will @entity23 -- who could be the nation 's first @entity8 first lady -- carry a theme of unity in light of controversial comments she 's made on the campaign trail that resulted in speculation about her patriotism ? aides in the @entity3 campaign say she 's already honing her message for the fall			1
" @entity1 wrote her own stump [ speech ]			2
and you know , she 's refining it now , i think , as we 're going into the general election , " said @entity39 , a senior @entity3 adviser			1
" we have an opportunity for her to kind of step back and think about the message she wants to deliver			2
so she 's really working on it as we speak			2
" her new speeches will include more details about her family and humble upbringing on @entity53 's @entity52 , aides say			0
@entity23 , 44 , was born in @entity53 , @entity54			1
she attended @entity55 and then went on to @entity56			0
she later became a vice president at the @entity58 and landed a job as a health care executive making $ 275,000 a year			0
@entity3 , @entity1 and their two daughters @entity63 , 10 , and @entity64 , 7 , live on the @entity52 of @entity53			1
but along with her success has come criticism			0
@entity67 , fashion editor with the @entity68 , told @entity0 that people see @entity23 in different ways			1
" some people will see confidence , and others might see cockiness			0
i think some people will see strength			0
others might see arrogance , " she said			0
" she comes across as someone who is extraordinarily independent and very much a force to be reckoned with			0
" behind the scenes , she maintains that independence			0
but with the election just months away , the potential first lady is trying to connect with voters on a more personal level			0
in june , she made an appearance as a guest co-host on @entity92 's " @entity91 , " and later , she and her husband graced the cover of @entity95			2
the magazine , headlined " @entity23 : why @entity3 loves her , " included details about her love for @entity99 , " @entity102 " and her daughters ' recitals			1
asked on " @entity91 " if she 's going through a makeover , she said she realizes that " i wear my heart on my sleeve " and that " it 's a risk you have to take			0
" she said she thinks people will change their perception of her as they see her family more			0
@entity111 , a first ladies historian , told @entity0 that it 's important for @entity23 to define herself before others define her			1
" one comment made off - hand ... might be easily misinterpreted by the opposition , " he said in june			2
@entity23 saw that in february when a @entity118 @entity117 ad used a snippet from a campaign event in @entity121 , @entity122			1
there , while referring to record voter turnout in the @entity17 primaries , she said , " for the first time in my adult lifetime , i am really proud of my country			2
" the @entity3 campaign called the ad " shameful , " and it was condemned by the state 's two @entity117 @entity12 senators			1
but the ad 's message caught on in conservative blogs -- and later forced @entity23 to clarify her remarks			2
" what i was clearly talking about is that i am proud in how @entity12 are engaging in the political process , " she responded			0
" i mean , everyone has said what i said , in that we have n't seen these record numbers of turnouts , people who are paying attention , going to rallies , watching debates			0
" @entity146 , the wife of sen. @entity147 , the presumptive @entity117 presidential nominee , also took a shot at @entity23 at the time , saying , " i am proud of my country			1
i do n't know about you , if you heard those words earlier			0
i am very proud of my country			0
" more recently , controversy erupted over a july 13 @entity153 magazine cover showing @entity3 in the @entity154 dressed in traditional @entity156 attire , and @entity23 with an @entity158 hairstyle and a machine gun slung over her back			1
an @entity8 flag can be seen burning in the fireplace , and a picture of @entity164 hangs on the wall			0
shortly after the magazine was published , @entity3 campaign spokesman @entity166 called the cover " tasteless and offensive			1
" @entity147 later said it was " totally inappropriate			0
" but the overall issue of @entity23 as a potential liability has made headlines on both coasts -- with articles in both the @entity175 and the @entity176 in early june			1
the newspapers pointed to relentless online rumor mills , criticism on conservative blogs and articles in conservative magazines , like the @entity183 , critical of @entity23			2
@entity175 columnist @entity184 wrote in june that the backlash against @entity23 was a " good preview of how @entity117 will attack @entity1 , suggesting that she does not share @entity8 values , mining a subtext of race			2
" conservatives view the presumptive @entity17 nominee 's wife as a target of opportunity			1
but one @entity117 consultant has said attacks on candidates ' wives often backfire			0
" considering there are so many issues -- legitimate issues -- that you can use on @entity3 , to attack his wife to me is sheer utter stupidity of the highest level , " @entity199 , a @entity117 strategist , told @entity0 in june			1
" mr. @entity3 is going to come to his wife 's defense , and it 's going to humanize both of them			1
" @entity117 strategists say the wife of the @entity17 presidential nominee is fair game			1
" there is less information about him to temper her comments against , so what she says represents something a lot more important than perhaps other candidates in the past who have had a longer track record , " @entity216 , a @entity117 strategist , also told @entity0			0
the potential first lady , however , appears to be bracing for what may lie ahead			0
" we 're trusting that the @entity8 voters are ready to talk about the issues and not talking about things that have nothing to do with making people 's lives better , " @entity23 told @entity231 during a joint interview in may			2
but @entity3 quickly added , " i also think these folks should lay off my wife			1
" @entity0 's @entity242 and @entity243 contributed to this report .			0
