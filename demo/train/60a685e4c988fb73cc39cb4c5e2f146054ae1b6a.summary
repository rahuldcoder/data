@entity0 -- with @entity4 's departure from the 2012 field of candidates seeking the @entity8 presidential nomination , several contenders have sought to claim the " tea party candidate " mantle			1
but for those entrenched in the movement , none of the remaining candidates have a legitimate claim to the title			2
@entity18 rep. @entity17 founded the tea party caucus in the @entity20 in 2010 and was designated one of the top 10 most conservative members of the chamber by @entity24 , sister organization to the @entity25 , an esteemed conservative think tank			1
she declared the tea party would " come home " to her campaign the day after @entity4 suspended his bid for the @entity20 earlier this month			1
but @entity17 must jockey with other candidates for that title			0
@entity34 rep. @entity33 claimed the tea party was started with his 2008 presidential campaign			1
he first ran for @entity36 in 1976 with the platform of @entity39 - based policy			0
twelve terms later , @entity33 has announced he will retire after serving			0
his philosophy jibes with the @entity28 value of crafting policy close to constitutional standards			2
@entity33 : i 'm the ' flavor of the decade ' former house speaker @entity46 has also entered the fray of tea party - professing candidates , with some help from across the aisle			1
the @entity52 released an ad painting @entity53 as the " original tea partier			0
" with a balanced budget on his resume , achieved during president @entity60 's second term , @entity53 has embraced the tea party movement from its beginning in 2009			1
so which of the three actually fit the mold ? " i do n't think anybody has a claim to that title , " said @entity65 , co-founder and national coordinator of the @entity67			2
" what we 're looking for is for all candidates to try their best to articulate and reflect tea party values , and i think that we 've been very successful in pushing the debate so that they 're all required to do so , " @entity65 said			1
" i do n't think that there 's any one candidate that can say that they 're the real tea party ( candidate ) , " she said			1
neither the @entity67 nor the @entity78 have endorsed a candidate from the field of seven , which includes @entity17 , @entity33 , @entity53 , former @entity87 sen. @entity86 , former @entity89 gov. @entity88 , @entity34 gov. @entity90 and former @entity92 gov. @entity91			1
@entity93 , founder and ceo of the @entity93 , endorsed @entity53 in september , but no candidate has yet received the bulk of party support			2
@entity98 , a former @entity99 candidate from @entity100 and a tea party darling , endorsed @entity91 on tuesday and decried tea partiers who have been " flocking " to @entity53 's campaign			1
@entity91 has been both panned and praised within the tea party movement , but when it comes to conservative chops , @entity65 and @entity107 say @entity17 , @entity33 and @entity53 all have something to boast about			1
@entity65 described @entity17 and @entity33 as having long - term records that are " consistent " with tea party values , but cautioned that the tea party caucus founded by @entity17 was assembled with the understanding that " they did n't speak for us , they did n't have any influence over us , " and " they do n't represent us			1
" instead , @entity65 says the caucus was intended as a " listening mechanism , not a representative mechanism			0
" @entity17 has only picked up three endorsements from the caucus , but @entity77 said that should n't have bearing on the way @entity28 supporters vote			2
" while i respect the tea party caucus and a lot of those members that are a part of that @entity36 , the @entity129 people do n't want a congressman or congresswoman or a senator to tell them that they should vote for a certain person , " she said			1
@entity77 touted @entity17 's " loud voice for the tea party dating back to the early days of the movement , " but she balked at @entity33 's credentials			1
" i never knew who @entity33 was before this tea party movement started , " she said			1
@entity77 stated the longtime congressman has n't been involved with the @entity78 and cited his absence during the bus tour leading up to the @entity1 / @entity67 @entity8 presidential debate in september			1
" i think it 's interesting that they claim that he 's the godfather of the tea party movement , but yet he does n't interact with the tea party movement whatsoever , " she said			1
conversely , for @entity77 , @entity53 can be credited with a long , tea party history			2
" the other interesting candidate out there is @entity46 because ( he ) has been involved in the tea party movement from the very beginning , " she said , crediting his organization @entity152 as being one of the original sponsoring organizations of the @entity156 and his staff members with reaching out to work with tea party groups across the country			1
" with @entity46 , one of the things that people like is that he was able to balance the budget when president @entity60 was in office ... he understands the importance of the conservative moment , " @entity77 said			0
" he 's been building that relationship			0
" but @entity1 contributor and conservative columnist @entity172 questions whether there is a tea party to be the candidate of			1
" those kinds of groups need enemies to be successful			0
they need to have someone they can point to , rail against and raise money to defeat			0
then , when you win , you 're out of enemies so the vigor of the organization tends to dissipate , if not the organization itself , " he said			0
" to that degree , that 's what has happened to the tea party			1
" an @entity198 / @entity197 survey released earlier this week indicated that 27 % of @entity8 primary voters nationwide consider themselves tea party supporters -- up two percentage points from november -- but 65 % say they do not			2
@entity172 noted 2010 @entity99 losses of tea party backed candidates @entity98 in @entity100 and @entity205 in @entity206 as lessons for the movement that prove endorsements may be too risky to gamble			1
" they went out of their way to nominate somebody that they liked and ended up losing the seat , " he said			0
" presidential politics in @entity129 is different than any other level â € ” the president is our version of royalty			0
it 's a far different and more thoughtful , more consuming thought as to who you 're going to vote for for president			0
" but tea party - backed candidates also posted big wins -- including four seats in the @entity99 , the governor 's mansion in @entity233 and seats in the @entity20			1
admitting that she 'd thought the @entity78 would have made an endorsement by now , @entity77 credited the volatility of the @entity8 race as a reason it has not and suggested efforts may be better directed elsewhere			2
" i thought we would 've made ( an endorsement ) by @entity243 , but the movement really needs to coalesce behind somebody before we get involved , " she said			0
" and because everybody is all over the place , i think it 's smart to focus on the @entity99 , because regardless of if [ president @entity249 ] @entity249 is re-elected or not , we need to have control of that @entity99			0
" the movement has not solidified around one candidate , due in part to the diversity of its supporters and an awareness that electability is a critical factor in securing the @entity8 nomination			2
@entity77 acknowledged it " could be an issue			0
" " these people in this movement , it 's not like they 're a bunch of idiots out there holding up signs and protesting the government			2
these people are doing their research ... and they 're making their decisions based upon what they 're learning			0
" the @entity198 / @entity197 poll found that while 40 % of @entity8 primary voters back @entity53 compared with 23 % who back @entity91 , in a hypothetical general election matchup , @entity249 would defeat the former @entity20 speaker 51 % -40 %			2
@entity91 comes closer , trailing 47 % -45 %			0
@entity33 placed third , but received 9 % support and has n't cracked the top two in national polls since announcing his candidacy			0
and although @entity17 won the critical @entity284 straw poll in @entity243 in august , she placed fourth in the survey and has consistently received single digit support			0
@entity53 and @entity91 may top polls measuring national support for the @entity8 candidates , but @entity65 hesitated in speculating on whether the nomination will be duked out between the two			0
" trying to make these kinds of predictions is foolhardy , " he said			0
@entity77 stated @entity91 still has bigger problems to face			0
" the thing that he 's going to have to reconcile with this grassroots movement is that at the end of the day , people do n't want a mandate for health care			0
it does n't matter if it 's a state mandate , they do n't want a mandate coming from state or federal government , " alluding to the health care plan @entity91 ushered in as @entity92 ' governor			2
both @entity77 and @entity65 are confident that , despite heavy - handed criticism of both frontrunners , the tea party movement will mobilize behind any candidate that is the nominee and prioritize @entity249 's defeat over tea party ideals			1
when asked whether tea party stalwarts will resist voting for a @entity8 nominee not in line with their values , @entity65 said , " there certainly may be some that will do that ( but ) i do n't think that 's the majority of people in the movement			1
" " there are very few people that have said that there 's no one that they can support , " @entity77 said			0
" @entity53 might not be everyone 's first choice and @entity91 might not be everyone 's first choice , but @entity249 is everyone 's last choice , " @entity172 said			1
" a lot of those guys understand that			0
