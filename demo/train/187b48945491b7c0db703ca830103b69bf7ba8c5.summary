@entity0 -- big tech firms and private prisons represent two industries vigorously lobbying to influence the scope of legislation aimed at overhauling @entity8 immigration policy , a political priority in @entity0			1
@entity10 , @entity11 , and @entity12 want lawmakers to support increasing the number of visas available to highly skilled workers , according to an analysis by the @entity18 , which tracks the influence of money in politics			1
others , like @entity23 , which builds detention facilities to house illegal immigrants , have contributed heavily to the campaigns of lawmakers who take tough stances on the issue			1
in all , 359 lobbying clients pressed their positions on immigration reform to officials at nearly every level of government , including the @entity37 , @entity38 and the @entity39 , according to the analysis for 2012			1
the figure is up from the 317 clients lobbying on immigration from the previous year			1
it is difficult to track exactly how much each spends on lobbying an issue , campaign finance experts say			2
however , tracking the number of times something specific is mentioned on disclosure reports indicates its importance to a company or industry			0
" they 're not spending this money just willy - nilly			2
they have a goal and they 're trying to achieve that goal legislatively , " said @entity56 , vice president of @entity57 , a watchdog group			0
" you have to be sure they 're writing the legislation for the right reasons and not just trying to benefit one particular company , " @entity56 said			2
president @entity67 underscored the need for comprehensive immigration reform earlier this year stressing the need to better enforce related laws , provide a path to citizenship for the more than 11 million undocumented workers already in the country and reform the legal immigration system			1
the so - called " @entity81 " in the @entity82 and a similar bipartisan group in the @entity37 are working on crafting a reform framework leading up to what could be one of the year 's biggest legislative showdowns			2
what 's in @entity82 immigration plan ? " the reason immigration is on the table now is the outcome of the last election , " said @entity86 , manager of the immigration policy program at the @entity88			0
" no political party likes to lose and the @entity95 realized that their unfriendly stance toward immigrants was creating a coalition in the @entity99			0
" the upcoming legislative battle will create winners and losers , and businesses are doing everything they can to ensure they can influence the outcome			0
" we will see @entity38 make it easier for that high - skilled , cutting - edged talent to come to the @entity8 but if they do n't address the channels for low skilled workers to come to the @entity8 , illegal immigration will continue , " @entity86 said			1
the nation 's tech sector , which has come to rely strongly on highly trained and science - savvy foreign workers , has long had a vested interest in immigration policy			1
when @entity38 failed to take action on the issue , big business and their lobbyists turned their attention to agencies and lawmakers for support in increasing the number of @entity128 visas			0
those are used by companies to temporarily employ foreign workers with special skills			2
but @entity128 visas are capped at 65,000 annually for those with undergraduate or professional degrees			0
another 20,000 are reserved for candidates with graduate - level credentials			0
the competition is fierce for slots and available caps are often exhausted quickly			0
@entity10 spent $ 8 million last year in broader lobbying efforts and filed 33 disclosure reports dealing with immigration â € ” twice the number of lobbying reports of companies like @entity12			1
@entity10 , which contributed $ 814,645 to president @entity67 's re-election campaign , submitted four reports showing that some of its lobbying efforts were directed at the executive office of the president			1
the company also lobbied @entity38 and 22 other federal agencies and offices on issues like corporate tax reform and antitrust law			0
but the second - highest number of lobbying reports filed by the company dealt with immigration			1
other tech companies also lobbied heavily			0
@entity12 spent $ 3.7 million in overall lobbying and filed 16 reports			1
@entity11 spent $ 3.9 million in overall lobbying and filed eight reports , including those for lobbying the executive office of the president and the @entity37			1
" the reality is that in the @entity8 , we are creating unfilled jobs faster than we are creating new filled positions , " @entity166 , @entity10 's executive vice president and general counsel , said during a speech at the nonpartisan @entity169 last year about his industry 's need for more highly - skilled workers			1
tech companies say they look for qualified @entity8 workers first , but are having a tough time finding college graduates with the needed skills to work in science and technology fields			1
a significant portion of these corporate workforces are comprised of well educated , highly - skilled foreign nationals who are highly sought after and can only go to work for an @entity8 company if they are extended an @entity128			1
@entity12 says it is encouraged by legislative changes in the works			2
several proposals to expand the available number of visas are working their way through @entity38			0
these include a bipartisan measure sponsored in part by @entity95 @entity198 sen. @entity197 , considered a potential 2016 presidential candidate			0
the lawmaker is also part of the " @entity81 " working on comprehensive immigration reform , which both parties view as a priority for capturing support from @entity206 , whose influence politically is growing			1
politicians also are weighing the impact on business and how attracting the best workers helps innovation , product development and productivity			0
" immigration reform is critical issue for @entity12 , " said company spokeswoman , @entity215			1
" in the last year , we have seen growing bipartisan support for high - skilled , employment - based visa reform			1
this is very encouraging to @entity12			2
" another " @entity81 " member , sen. @entity222 has changed his views on immigration over the years			0
for instance , the @entity226 @entity95 first supported and later opposed a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants			0
he is also the fourth - highest recipient of campaign donations from @entity23			0
@entity233 chairman @entity232 and @entity82 minority leader @entity234 , both @entity236 republicans , are other notable recipients of that company 's campaign donations , according to @entity18 data			0
" the private prison industry is responsible for 16 % of federal prisoners in the @entity8 and makes a substantial portion of its profits from detention centers for illegal immigrants , " the group said			2
" illegal immigration creates a pool of potential prisoners and there 's some incentive to them wanting to have input on those policies , " @entity86 said			0
in one case last year , lobbyists representing @entity23 were paid $ 60,000 to monitor " issues pertaining to the construction and management of private prisons and detention facilities , " according a federal lobbying disclosure report			1
@entity23 spent $ 970,000 last year to lobby @entity38 and the @entity264 on a variety of issues			0
it says it supports a bipartisan group of lawmakers who support or are " open minded to the merits of public - private partnership and the related services we provide			2
" the company says its lobbying effort has been aimed at ensuring it understands reforms related to new civil detention facilities being pursued by @entity278			1
" not a single firm hired by @entity23 lobbies on our behalf for or against immigration enforcement or detention policies			2
every firm we engage with is contractually bound to adhering to this strict policy			0
the primary focus of our lobbying efforts is education on the merits and benefits of public - private partnership in corrections and detention generally , and the relevant services @entity23 provides , " said company spokesman @entity284			1
construction , agricultural , leisure and hospitality were among other industries also lobbying @entity38 and federal agencies heavily last year on such issues as changing the nation 's guest worker program			0
whether spending on immigration lobbying will have any impact remains to be seen , policy and lobbying experts say			2
" lobbying on immigration reform is like lobbying on any complicated legislation in @entity0 : messy and unpredictable			1
just as with tax reform and health care reform , every affected constituency in the immigration debate is pushing their own agenda , " said @entity309 , a veteran immigration attorney			2
" sometimes the stars align and a bill gets passed , " @entity309 said			0
" often , however , the effort fails , despite or because of everyone 's efforts			0

companies push immigration reform lobbying blitz for different reasons
@entity10 , @entity12 , @entity11 want more visas for highly - skilled workers
private prisons want tough immigration laws to help keep detention facilities filled
lobbying efforts could help craft immigration reform legislation
