-- the @entity2 town of @entity3 is on the verge of running dry			1
" we have about two weeks of water left , " @entity3 mayor @entity5 said			1
her central @entity2 town , population 4,300 , is one of the latest victim 's of the state 's ongoing drought			1
a lack of rain and the summer 's intense heat -- more than 90 days of triple - digit temperatures -- combined to dry out the @entity3 water supply			1
" we lost more water to evaporation than we were using this summer , " @entity5 said in a telephone interview			1
@entity22 is the city 's primary source of water			2
heat evaporation took roughly 731 million gallons of water from the lake			1
the city used only 54 million			0
@entity3 residents spent monday waiting on the @entity31 to approve an emergency three - mile pipeline to divert water off the @entity35 , using a public creek as a stop - gap to shorten the distance			1
" our water comes from a river , that goes into a lake , then comes down a river			2
we came up with a plan to go around the lake , " said the mayor			2
the city already has approval from another agency , the @entity49 on @entity50 , for seven miles of alternative pipeline , but with the clock ticking , @entity46 said residents ca n't afford the two weeks to lay the piping in the approved plan			2
the new plan will take the city four days to construct			2
" i might as well be optimistic , " the mayor said , laughing			0
there is a bit to be optimistic this week -- @entity61 week			0
outside of the local federal prison , the school district is the biggest water user			0
some 1,600 children -- many from outside the city limits in surrounding @entity67 -- draw on @entity3 's water supply on school days			1
but schools are out for the holiday this week			0
" we are counting on this to extend our usage , " said @entity5			0
she speculates it may buy the town an extra week			0
the pipeline , when it happens , is a temporary fix			0
it will cost $ 200,000 in construction , and $ 35,000 per month on pipe rental			0
the city is calculating using it for six months even though officials have drought - forecast beyond that			1
the city also is contracting with a well driller out of @entity89 to search for ground water .			0

like much of @entity2 , the town of @entity3 suffered through a summer of intense heat
triple - digit temperatures cooked the area for more than 90 days , along with the ongoing drought
" we lost more water to evaporation than we were using this summer , " says the mayor
" we have about two weeks of water left , " says the mayor
