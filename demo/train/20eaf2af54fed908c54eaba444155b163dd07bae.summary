-- @entity2 's life in @entity3 was still getting started when a bullet to the head killed the 9 - year - old			1
@entity7 was studying to become a doctor when his life ended			2
they were just two of a group of unarmed @entity3 civilians who died when four former @entity14 private security contractors opened fire at @entity16 in @entity17 on september 16 , 2007			1
eighteen others were wounded in an incident that has been a controversial political and diplomatic case from the start and which still reverberates seven years later			1
on tuesday , a @entity22 jury began deliberations on whether the four guards -- @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 -- are guilty or acted in self - defense			1
only @entity25 is charged with first - degree murder ; that 's in the slaying of the driver of a white @entity35 sedan in the @entity17 traffic circle			1
prosecutors argued @entity25 , the team 's sniper , lit the fuse of the entire incident when he fired on and killed the driver			1
the @entity43 alleges the other three men " unlawfully and intentionally , upon a sudden quarrel and heat of passion , did commit voluntary manslaughter " in the ensuing chaos when they opened fire			2
the defendants deny all charges and say they acted in self - defense after they were fired upon by militants			1
' it was horror ' attorney @entity58 was driving to work when he got trapped in traffic at the square			2
that 's when the shooting started			2
like many others , he tried to flee , but he was shot three times			2
" it was horror ... people were terrified , " he said			0
" people running out of their cars were being shot at ... anything that moved in @entity16 was shot			0

" @entity58 testified in @entity22 and said he has faith in the @entity76 justice system			1
" i felt that there are people who care about this , " he said			0
" i have trust that there will be justice			0
" long road to trial a federal judge in 2008 dismissed the original case , finding the @entity43 withheld key evidence and violated the guards ' rights			2
but a federal appeals court later reversed that decision , leading the government to seek a fresh indictment and trial			0
the incident prompted international outrage at the time , and the criminal prosecution in the @entity76 has dragged on for years			1
the killings led @entity3 's government to slap limits on security contractors hired by various firms , including @entity102 - based @entity14 , which was sold by founder @entity103 and is known as @entity14			1
" the vast majority of the @entity76 contractors who served in @entity3 did so with honor and integrity , but , as alleged today , these defendants abused their power through a relentless attack on unarmed civilians that recklessly exceeded any possible justification , " said @entity76 attorney @entity104 " this prosecution demonstrates our commitment to upholding the rule of law even in times of war and to bringing justice to the memories of those innocent men , women , and children who were gunned down in @entity17 more than six years ago , " he said			1
prosecutor : defendants did not have ' a blank check ' on thursday , @entity76 attorney @entity129 told the jury of five men and seven women in his closing argument that the former contractors , " took something that did n't belong to them , the lives of 14 individuals			1
" " people who could laugh and live were turned into bloody , bullet - ridden corpses by these men , " @entity139 said , turning and pointing at the defendants			1
prosecutors said the men fired at the @entity35 with machine guns and grenade launchers			0
pictures of deceased and injured were displayed on a large board adjacent to the jury			0
" none of these people were armed			0
none of these people on this board posed a threat to these men , " @entity139 said			0
" the fact this happened in a war - torn country did not give the defendants a blank check			1
" the former private security guards were working for @entity14 handling diplomatic security for the @entity164			0
their attorneys argued that @entity16 , close to the fortified @entity166 , was a hostile environment			0
they said the @entity14 teams in the area were under constant threat , specifically from car bombs targeting convoys such as the one in which they arrived			0
" every civilian death in a war zone is a tragedy , but not every death is a crime , " @entity175 , a defense attorney for @entity176 , argued in his closings			2
the defense attorney said the guards were fired on by militants when they arrived in the traffic circle , a key point of disagreement between the defense and the prosecution			1
@entity175 said it was actually @entity176 , not @entity25 , who fired first on the @entity35 at its engine block to try to stop the vehicle after the team perceived it to be a car bomb threat rapidly approaching their convoy			0
" we know now it was a medical student and his mother , " @entity175 said of the occupants of the sedan , " but my client did n't know that at the time			0
" " [ @entity176 ] did his job in @entity16 and defended other @entity76 in an war zone			1
" judge @entity206 thanked the jury for their service during this long trial , which stretched over 44 days in court			0
