-- no @entity2 family embodies mainstream @entity4 more than the @entity3 , noted a @entity6 article this year			1
for three generations , @entity8 men have occupied towering positions in the party pantheon , and the party 's demographic and ideological shifts can be traced through the branches of the @entity8 family tree : from @entity18 , the blue - blooded @entity19 , and @entity8 , the transitional figure who tried and failed to emulate the approach of the @entity23 , to @entity24 , who embodied the new breed of tax - cutting , evangelical conservatism			1
indeed , the @entity3 ' metamorphosis from genial centrism to deep - fried conservatism has both anticipated and reflected the party 's trajectory			1
but now , @entity33 , a potential 2016 presidential candidate , seems to be bucking the trend			1
he is seeking to return the party to its ideological moorings -- toward the centrism of his grandfather			1
even before the @entity40 's ignominious defeat in november , @entity33 was offering tough love to his party , suggesting that @entity40 stand up to @entity43 and craft a bipartisan compromise to reduce the deficit significantly			1
but will @entity40 listen ? there are many reasons to believe they wo n't			1
@entity18 was a @entity48 investment banker who called himself a " moderate progressive			2
" in the 1952 primary between conservative presidential candidate sen. @entity51 and moderate gen. @entity52 , @entity18 chose @entity52 -- and became the president 's favorite golf partner			1
@entity18 rode @entity52 's coattails into the @entity56 , where he focused on urban renewal , spearheading the @entity58			2
an early proponent of the line - item veto , he received national recognition as an advocate of fiscal responsibility			1
@entity18 's son @entity8 left for @entity64 in 1948 when @entity64 was still a one - party state			2
but change was afoot in the @entity67 , and by the time @entity8 ran for @entity56 in 1964 , he encountered a flourishing @entity68 that had recently elected its first @entity2 senator by attracting hordes of conservative democrats			1
but the new rank - and - file republicans were nothing like the @entity75 republicans he knew -- or even like those in the @entity79 suburbs			0
biographer @entity80 imagined @entity8 's vexation at this new breed of @entity64 @entity19 : " these ... these nuts ! they were coming out of the woodwork ! they talked about blowing up the @entity87 , about armed revolt against the income tax			0
... the nuts hated him			0
they could smell @entity93 on him			0
" recognizing that his 1964 primary campaign would need to be more @entity95 than @entity96 , he ignored the social problems @entity18 had addressed			0
" only unbridled free enterprise can cure unemployment , " @entity8 asserted , contending that government bore no responsibility for alleviating poverty			2
though he lost , he began the transition to @entity105 conservatism that would make him ( barely ) acceptable to @entity106 as a running mate			0
but he never fully evolved : he famously reneged on his " no new taxes " pledge			0
his son @entity24 would complete the transition			0
@entity24 's first major legislative accomplishment as president was the enactment of a massive $ 1.6 trillion tax cut			0
he rode roughshod over the green - eyeshade types to pass a massive tax cut			0
when it produced runaway deficits , he accepted @entity120 's argument : " @entity106 taught us that deficits do n't matter			0
" in adopting @entity105 conservatism -- sometimes clumsily -- @entity8 and @entity24 anticipated the @entity68 's ideological shift			0
hence , in evaluating @entity33 's prescriptions for fiscal responsibility , today 's @entity40 should recall the @entity3 ' past political palm reading			1
politics is about addition , not subtraction			0
every year , as @entity40 maintain the electoral coalition that responds to their platform , they face an inevitable subtraction from their base			1
that 's because unyielding stances on taxes and deficits practically guarantee that young voters will continue opposing them , and the ( older and whiter ) constituencies who favor them shrink as a percentage of the electorate			2
republicans who believe they can continue to win with their current coalition are like rats who believe they can outrun a treadmill			2
as the nation approaches $ 16 trillion of debt and grapples with the baby boomer retirement , young voters will grasp that every dollar spent on entitlement programs is a dollar paid by already - strapped young workers			2
that may well push young voters to support the party with the most credible deficit - reduction plan			2
according to 2012 exit polls , 60 % of young voters ( aged 18 - 29 ) supported president @entity163			2
young voters also made up a slightly larger share of the electorate than they had in 2008			2
this is a huge problem for republicans for three reasons			0
one , people tend to vote with higher frequencies once they hit their 30s			0
two , generational cohorts tend to stick with the party they supported in their formative years			0
and most obviously , young voters are more likely to be around to vote in the future			2
if it were just about math , @entity33 could convince the party to adopt what polling shows are clearly winning positions			1
but as the work of scholars @entity183 and @entity184 suggests , it 's not a linear equation : it 's about momentum and intensity within the @entity19 coalition			0
that 's because the newest entrants to a party 's electoral coalition are usually its most robust -- and the hardest to roll in intraparty skirmishes			0
for @entity40 , it is the mostly white and older tea partiers , who block electorally beneficial positions on taxes			1
the next newest entrants to the coalition are @entity204 conservatives , many of whom also strongly oppose tax increases			0
fiscally conservative and socially progressive @entity96 types are the oldest group , but they 've been leaving the @entity68 for decades			0
whereas many of them supported @entity19 congressional candidates in the 1970s , far less did by the 2000s			0
so while this group is the easiest to persuade of the need for adjustments ( indeed , many already share @entity33 's views ) , they hold the least sway in the party			1
what does all this mean ? @entity2 parties since the @entity223 have periodically shed the coalition elements that are most distant from their activist base			1
while @entity33 's prescriptions are in the party 's long - term interest , they will be difficult to execute , given the strength of the party 's coalition members			1
can @entity33 sway a resistant party base ? it 's quite possible : his family 's odyssey has reflected the party 's shifts for 50 years , and he 's uniquely positioned to convince his peers			1
if @entity40 listen , it will constitute a return to their roots -- and a reckoning with demographic reality			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity247 .			1

@entity247 : no @entity2 family embodies @entity4 more than the @entity3
@entity247 : @entity33 , a potential 2016 presidential candidate , may be bucking the trend
he says @entity33 advocates for fiscal responsibility and standing up to @entity43
@entity247 : if @entity40 can return to its more centrist roots , then it has a chance to win more voters
