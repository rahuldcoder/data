@entity9 , the mayor of the town of @entity11 , wore a @entity7 uniform during a fashion show over the weekend			1
@entity9 , the mayor of the town of @entity11 , and his 15 - year - old son " entered the stage marching the clearly identifiable @entity7 ' goose step , ' " the @entity14 and @entity15 in @entity4 said in a letter to the country 's prosecutor general			1
the organization 's director , @entity23 , said @entity9 had broken @entity4 law and encouraged his son to do the same , " educating him to treat the law with contempt			1
" @entity23 said @entity9 was sending a message " that to wear @entity7 uniforms and to march the @entity7 steps is legal and ' in vogue ' in @entity4			1
" he urged the authorities and the head of @entity9 's @entity37 party to show that message " will be strongly countermanded			2
" @entity9 , 41 , said he had not noticed the @entity7 swastika symbol on the uniform before he wore it , according to the @entity42 newspaper			1
" i checked it before i put it on but the swastika was very small and i did n't see it , " he said			0

@entity57 sent @entity0 a copy of the letter			0
he said it was no defense that the uniform was that of the @entity70 -- the army -- rather than the @entity72 , the elite @entity7 guard which took the lead in killing @entity2 during the @entity75			1
" the @entity70 played an active role in the mass murder of @entity78 and many other innocent victims			0
by dressing in a @entity70 uniform , you are expressing totally unwarranted support and nostalgia for an army which committed the most terrible war crimes and acts of genocide , " the letter said			0

" he has a history of being outrageous , but his antics have never included something that i would deal with , " @entity57 said			0
" he 's a real character , apparently			0
he 's also very popular , which makes this much more difficult			0
" @entity0 attempts to contact @entity9 were unsuccessful			0
