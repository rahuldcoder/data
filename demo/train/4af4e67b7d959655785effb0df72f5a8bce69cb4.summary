-- containing the @entity3 outbreak sweeping @entity4 is plausible -- but action needs to be taken immediately , before affected states potentially collapse and the virus spirals out of control , campaigner @entity1 says			1
" even out of self - interest you have to act in these instances , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity9			1
" there is no time - lag between what happens in the poor parts of the world and it affecting us , which is why we have to ... intervene quite radically and effectively and immediately			0
" since the outbreak started in march , about 9,000 @entity3 cases and 4,493 deaths have been reported , mostly in @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 , according to the @entity26			1
the @entity26 has warned there could be up to 10,000 new @entity3 cases per week across the three hardest - hit nations by the end of the year			2
@entity1 , the musician responsible for coordinating live aid concerts to draw attention to famine in @entity4 in the 1980s , said people starved then because they could n't grow food and they and their governments had no money to buy any			1
" in effect they died of poverty			0
" the same is happening now in @entity4			2
they do n't have the doctors , nurses , hospitals , state systems that they have in @entity49 or @entity50 and so once again , through no fault of their own , this virus is out of control in states where there are no systems -- because there is no money , " he said			2
in @entity25 , one of the nations worst - hit by @entity3 , the situation was " particularly tragic , " he said			1
" @entity25 was just getting off its knees , beginning to breathe , the economy was beginning to have traction and people were beginning to get well educated , hospitals were being built , " @entity1 said			1
" you could be looking at -- some people think -- some sort of state collapse , which would be utterly unthinkable because the disease itself , should that happen , would then spiral away by itself			2
" but @entity1 was hopeful the spread of the virus could be halted			1
" with the right will , the right level of commitment , this can be contained			0
the issue is , will it be contained in time to stop these states collapsing and then other evils -- human evils -- emanating from that , " he said			1
" i 've been briefed on what the response is and should all of it happen then i think it 's plausible			0
but it has to happen immediately , it has to happen now			0
it 's now beyond getting together and having a summit			0
it 's now calling up the various leaders and saying ' now , do it now , mobilize this thing instantly and proactively			0
" the medical organization @entity96 -- or @entity97 -- had warned six months ago of the @entity3 threat to the world and " we should have put a stop to it then , " he said			2
an effective response , however , depended on more than " just the usual suspects " of @entity104 and the @entity105 getting involved , said @entity1			0
" it should be in the interest to the @entity108 and the @entity109 and the @entity110 to contribute to this and we hear very little from them and we should hear more			0
