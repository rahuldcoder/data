polls for the @entity2 presidential election opened tuesday against the backdrop of a bloody and protracted civil war			1
the outcome is hardly in doubt : president @entity7 is almost guaranteed to emerge victorious in a vote that opposition groups and many @entity11 countries say has been be rigged from the start			1
@entity2 is n't renowned for holding free and fair elections			1
when @entity7 came to power 14 years ago , he ran unopposed , securing more than 99 % of votes , according to state media			1
seven years later , he won again with a similarly mountainous share of the vote			0
his father , @entity18 , ruled @entity2 with an iron fist for 29 years before he died in 2000			2
the @entity2 regime says the election has to be held under the new constitution and shows the country is moving forward			1
but some analysts say the purpose of this week 's vote , which @entity28 secretary general ban ki - moon urged the @entity2 government not to hold , is to send a message to @entity7 's opponents , both in @entity2 and abroad			1
@entity2 's presidential election : how fair can a vote be in a war zone ? ' a coronation ' " it 's a coronation of @entity7 , it 's a celebration of his ability to survive the violent storm and basically go on the offensive , " said @entity36 , a professor of international relations at the @entity38			1
the election takes place amid a grinding three - year conflict that has killed around 150,000 people , displaced about 6.5 million within @entity2 and prompted almost 3 million to flee outside its borders			1
@entity50 will take place only in areas controlled by the regime			0
state television showed @entity7 and his wife , @entity55 , casting their votes at a school in @entity58 , a neighborhood of @entity59			2
rebels hold significant parts of the north and east of the country			0
there are concerns that violence could disrupt the election process , with voters wary of the threat of car bombs and shelling at polling stations within range of rebel mortars			2
the @entity74 , one of the largest armed rebel groups , announced it would n't target election centers			1
it claimed the @entity7 government was blackmailing people to vote in a fake election , but said it wanted to avoid civilian casualties			1
the @entity82 has said the vote " will be a grotesque parody of democracy			0
" the @entity86 says the @entity7 regime has taken steps " to make it difficult if not impossible to have a fair and free election in @entity2			1
" the regime has said election monitors from the @entity93 , the @entity94 or the @entity95 wo n't be present , but observers from some other countries will be			1
war continues amid election warplanes bombed anti-government neighborhoods tuesday as @entity2 cast their ballots , the opposition - run @entity100 said			1
in the western city of @entity107 , warplane shelling killed at least two people , the @entity100 said			0
and warplanes dropped at least 20 barrels packed with crude explosive devices over @entity113 in the @entity59 suburbs , pushing thick columns of smoke into the afternoon sky , social media video showed			0
the @entity100 also said that 28 people , including three children , were killed during voting tuesday			2
meanwhile , in the once bustling commercial capital of @entity122 , residents dropped mock ballots in a makeshift ballot box " to withdraw the citizenship of president @entity7 , " social media video showed tuesday			1
@entity127 could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the videos			0
@entity2 's official election body praised what it called a high turnout of voters and said " no problems whatsoever have been reported so far during the balloting process ongoing in @entity2 , " said @entity136 , @entity2 's national news agency			1
@entity2 state television reported that because of the high turnout at polling stations , the @entity138 for elections extended voting by five hours , so it will end at midnight tuesday			1
little - known challengers one aspect of this year 's election distinguishes it from the previous foregone conclusions			0
@entity148 actually has people running against him -- although it 's questionable how much of a challenge they present			0
the two other candidates are relative unknowns : @entity154 , a businessman and former government minister ; and @entity157 , a lawmaker			0
critics say they are just pawns or window dressing to give the election a veneer of democracy			0
but the @entity2 government has dismissed any criticism of the process			0
@entity157 has kept a low profile , but @entity154 says he 's serious about challenging @entity7 and is " trying to attack his weaknesses			2
" speaking ahead of the election , he claimed he would be " more aggressive and more effective " than @entity7 on economic , administrative and social issues			2
but on the overarching question of the war , @entity173 offers no dissent			0
" politically , i think he 's doing what he has to do , " he said			0
rebels divided what @entity7 is doing is continuing the brutal offensive against those opposed to his regime , raining down barrel bombs on rebel - controlled parts of cities such as @entity122 and @entity188			2
the opposition groups fighting against him are divided , with squabbling between factions and jihadis who have flocked from around the world to try to establish an @entity74 state			0
the rebels have lost ground around @entity59 and @entity197 and are under pressure in @entity122 and the south of the country			0
talks this year mediated by the @entity28 did little to change the situation , ending with the regime and the opposition firmly opposed			0
@entity206 's office has warned that the elections are likely to worsen the situation , saying they " will damage the political process and hamper the prospects for a political solution that the country so urgently needs			0
" if @entity7 emerges victorious , as expected , it will further diminish the likelihood of his stepping down anytime soon			2
the @entity2 opposition and @entity11 countries insist that @entity7 ca n't be part of any body that , under an agreement signed in @entity220 , @entity221 , earlier this year , would lead the country through a transitional period .			1
