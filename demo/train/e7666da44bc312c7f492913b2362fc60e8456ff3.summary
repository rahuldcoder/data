@entity0 , @entity1 -- in @entity4 and @entity0 , they will be talking about this for many years to come			1
of all the ways to break @entity8 's monopoly on @entity1 league titles , going to the home of the champions and robbing them of their crown in their own backyard takes some beating			1
in the @entity17 heartland saturday , unfashionable @entity4 produced a storybook ending to one of the most enthralling seasons @entity1 football -- or indeed any @entity22 league -- has ever produced			1
but as @entity24 celebrated , the soul searching began in @entity0			2
winner takes all for the first time since 1951 ( and only the third time ever ) , the destiny of the title lay in the hands of two teams facing each other on the final day			2
@entity8 entertained an @entity4 team which had n't won the domestic league since 1996 -- during which time @entity8 had added eight more @entity36 to the club 's roll of honor			1
the equation was simple : win , and @entity8 would be crowned champions for a fourth time in five seasons ; draw or win , and @entity4 would take the title for the first time in 18 years , when current manager @entity45 was captain			1
in the end , it was deservingly , fittingly , gloriously @entity45 's triumph -- and one that now propels the @entity51 coach into the stratosphere , such is the epic scale of the revolution he has presided over since taking charge of " @entity4 " in december 2011			1
champions of @entity57 ? a team that rarely won anything , that only found new ways of losing , was at once transformed ; @entity62 triumph in 2012 was quickly followed by the @entity63 and then the @entity64 in 2013			0
@entity45 had molded and inspired a group of disparate talents into a squad with a win - at - all - costs , never - say - die mentality			0
with the league now in the bag too , @entity45 and his team have the chance to add the ultimate prize to their ever - expanding trophy cabinet when they meet arch - rivals @entity78 in saturday 's @entity80 final in @entity81			1
" i would say that this win means something for everyone , " said @entity45 , who saw his team gain the 1 - 1 draw they needed despite losing the services of 27 - goal striker @entity85 and midfield mischief - maker @entity86 inside the first 20 minutes			2
" it shows that there is more than one way to win			0
it is one of the most important days in the history of @entity4			2
" yet how few @entity24 were there to celebrate such a seismic feat. officially , 447 of their fans were present at the 98,000 - capacity @entity101 , though a few others were easily seen dotted around the gigantic arena			0
they managed to make themselves heard , however , especially when @entity106 leveled just after halftime and again at fulltime			0
the @entity24 stayed right where they were for at least an hour after the final whistle to sing and dance and acclaim their heroes			0
those men must have looked tiny , like @entity115 figures , from their position right at the top of the third tier behind the goal where @entity106 created history , but it did n't seem to matter one bit			0
and to their credit , @entity0 ensured @entity24 would have even more treasured memories of their special day as they stayed true to their " @entity8 " ( " more than a club " ) motto			1
' they showed @entity8 is a great club ' the home fans responded to the apparent ignominy of having their title taken away from them on their own turf by rising as one the very moment the game was over , proceeding to give @entity4 's players the standing ovation their herculean effort deserved			1
two minutes later and " @entity24 , @entity24 " reverberated around the amphitheater as @entity45 and his gladiators , almost disbelievingly , looked up and soaked in the adulation			0
" @entity8 players and coaches came to congratulate me immediately after the game , " added @entity45			2
" they showed @entity8 is a great club			2
" so what of this great club ? for one so used to winning and for fans usually so quick to wave their white handkerchiefs as a way of registering their disdain , they seemed awfully accepting of their fate			0
the mood in the city all day was upbeat , yet strangely free from the tension that usually engulfs occasions of such enormity ; do n't forget , this was a title that coach @entity155 had already conceded two weeks ago , before a succession of bizarre results handed his side one last unlikely shot at glory			1
it never felt like their title to win , though			0
with the heartbreaking trauma of ex-coach @entity167 's tragic passing in april still fresh in the mind , and with several players mooted to be leaving this summer , even before saturday the focus had shifted to next season and the future			0
an emotional month reached a crescendo as first long - serving goalkeeper @entity173 -- who has been injured since march -- said his farewells on monday and then on thursday club captain @entity175 , a mainstay of @entity0 since the mid- 1990s , gave his final press conference before walking away from the @entity101			1
it is not so much half a new team @entity8 are looking for over the next couple of months as almost a replacement soul			2
what next for @entity8 ? former captain @entity182 , who played for the @entity17 with distinction between 1996 and 2004 and managed @entity184 from 2008 - 11 , was appointed monday as the club 's new coach after leaving his post at @entity188			1
@entity182 led @entity188 to ninth place in @entity190 in his only season in charge , after a difficult first senior appointment at @entity195 club @entity194 in 2011 - 12			0
now that @entity196 -- arguably the world 's greatest footballer and certainly its best - paid exponent -- has signed a new contract , @entity8 must try to rediscover what made them one of the most breathtakingly successful teams the sport has ever seen			2
" i feel so bad , i feel disappointment and disillusionment , " said midfielder @entity203 on social media			0
" next year we will fight to give you the joys that you and this club deserve			0
" as for @entity4 , whose fans celebrated long into the night at @entity213 in the @entity1 capital and then took to the streets of @entity4 sunday as their champions paraded through the city on an open - top bus , the focus is rather more short - term			1
at the @entity220 in @entity81 on saturday , they will seek to put their name on the biggest trophy of them all for the very first time , and in the process deny city rivals real " @entity229 " -- the 10th @entity80 / @entity80 title that has so frustratingly eluded the club since 2002			1
@entity45 , a man who has the underdog spirit coursing through his veins , will already be licking his lips in anticipation .			0

@entity4 wins @entity1 league after drawing at @entity0
it is club 's first title in almost 20 years and ends @entity8 's reign
