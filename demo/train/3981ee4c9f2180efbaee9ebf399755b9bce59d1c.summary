-- just when you think we 're becoming civilized and smarter about our knowledge of gender , you get a stupid decision such as the one from the @entity6 and you wonder whether sanity will ever reign			2
i thought we had decided the issue that men 's " uncontrollable lust " was indeed controllable , and if they did n't control it , they were going to be charged and convicted of sexual harassment , rape , frottage -- well you get the idea			1
so now the all - male @entity6 has said , albeit in a new way , that men are so controlled by their gonads that they can fire an employee at will for being able to incite attraction , sex , love , whatever			2
no matter that she is just going about her job or being a stellar employee ; if she 's got a cute butt or a nicely turned nose , her job is history			2
if you have n't heard , the court stood by an earlier ruling that a @entity38 dentist acted legally when he fired his dental assistant -- even while acknowledging she had been an excellent employee for 10 years -- because he and his wife were afraid he would try to start an affair with her and ruin their marriage			1
the employee had sued for sex discrimination			1
but the court said firing an employee for being too attractive , despite no inappropriate behavior on her part , is not sex discrimination because gender is not the issue			1
do n't tell me this has nothing to do with gender			2
i do n't see women firing men because they ca n't control themselves			1
is this because they do n't have manly kind of urges ? or is it because they do n't have access to the same excuses , such as uncontrollable attraction and desire ? either way , it 's a gender issue			1
and if a woman is denied employment because of her gender , that is a protected legal status			0
but the @entity6 guys did n't see it that way			0
by the way , @entity6 women : is this enough to motivate you to get some women on your @entity6 ? the guys saw the issue , at least in part , as protecting the institution of marriage rather than an infringement on a woman 's right to work			1
let 's be real honest here : if the only way this man and woman could protect their marriage is to remove an attractive woman from their midst , then i 'd say this marriage has a lot more problems than just an attractive dental assistant			1
what is this dentist 's wife going to do -- put blinders on her husband like a race horse ? do employees have to pass an ugliness test ? do they pick the couples in their extended friendship network according to whether the wife is curvaceous ? women have been at risk because of their looks for a long time			0
there are online sites where women are evaluated like so many heifers on whether they are " @entity121 ? " words such as " dog " " sow " " and needing a " paper bag over her head " have been thrown at us as a part of male bravado			0
beautiful women get cat - calls , sometimes really rude and threatening gestures and unwanted commentary on their looks			0
talk about women being between a rock and a hard place			0
insulted and not hired if they are n't attractive , fired if they are too attractive			2
could someone tell us just exactly how we should look ? more important , could we have some continuing education for the courts around the nation so that they realize looks are a gender issue -- and therefore protecting women from being fired because of them is appropriate			1
if another case like this goes through the judicial system , i hope a very different conclusion will be reached			0
otherwise , all kinds of firings may arise that use this excuse to get rid of women employees			0
why , this could even spread to the courts -- male judges might ban some women lawyers from presenting cases because , gosh darn it , they are just too lovely			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity167 .			0

@entity170 court rules it 's not sex discrimination for a man to fire a woman because she 's attractive
@entity167 thought we 're at the point that if a man ca n't control his lust , it 's *illegal*
@entity167 : women are insulted , not hired if *unattractive* , fired if they are too pretty
*saving* your marriage by firing an employee for her looks is a gender issue , she says
