-- as a generation , millennials have been called coddled , under - qualified , whiny and , recently , " screwed			1
" apparently , both our egos and our grade point averages are wildly inflated			2
thanks for your input , everyone			2
but there 's a time for taking constructive criticism , and there 's a time to take it personally			1
what better time than now ? it 's fight or flight at this point			1
some cards are stacked against us ( a rough job market and poor economy , for starters ) , and now we can add to that a serious @entity24 problem			2
we have never looked worse			2
because of all that , we 've got a chip on our shoulders			2
we 're frustrated , angry , tired and scared â € ” the ultimate underdogs			0
but i think we deserve more credit , and it 's up to us to prove it			1
a millennial 's plea : we must vote ours are the hands that will shape the next decade â € ” culturally , socially and economically			1
so instead of thinking about being " millennial " as something that happened to us , why do n't we figure out how we will define it ? despite the headlines , we 've proven to be a pretty smart , organized and resourceful generation already			1
here are some reasons to be hopeful about what millennials will do in the decades to come , and how we members of " @entity45 ? " can make it out of our current crisis			1
we 're brave there are plenty of young people accomplishing feats and pushing boundaries right now , and i 'm glad they 're on team millennial			0
take @entity56 , for example			0
he 's the 23 - year - old mayor of @entity58 , @entity59 , the town where he grew up			1
since he took office in january , @entity56 has focused on increasing traffic to @entity58 's downtown and created a new government position to promote local art. he also happens to be openly gay and surprised many people by getting elected at all			1
@entity56 says he frequently speaks with other motivated young people and believes despite its sometimes bad rap , the millennial generation is ambitious			1
what they do n't teach you in college : job - seeking as a millennial " i would n't be here today if i listened to the people who told me i was too young to be mayor , " he says			1
" make a decision about what your goal is , and your life has to revolve around what that goal is			0
" the young mayor believes there 's a logical place to start for millennials looking to change the world			1
" people often think they have to go to a capital city or to a different city to improve their community , but what better place to improve than where you come from , " he says			0
" if we all improve the communities we were born and raised in , that could go a long way in improving our country			0
" @entity99 , the chief operating officer at @entity100 , is another millennial all - star			0
and she believes in us , too			0
the first - generation @entity103 is 28 now , but when she was just 17 she helped to register 30,000 voters as @entity106 coordinator for the " @entity108 " initiative			1
for the past seven years she has worked at @entity109 , an organization dedicated to empowering and investing in millennials , who @entity99 thinks are " uniquely positioned " to solve the challenges the @entity103 is facing			1
" what typifies this generation is they have a real idealism and hopefulness about what the future is going to look like in our hands , " @entity99 says			1
we 're skilled and driven remember not too long ago when we were clawing each other 's eyes out to get into college ? memories of that level of crazed intensity make me cringe ( let 's try to forget the day i cried over a bowl of tomato soup in the cafeteria about a bad quiz grade ) , but also suggest that as a generation , we ca n't be all that lazy			1
cash - strapped millennials curate style via social media maybe the biggest source of hope is how " overscheduled " we were as children			1
our parents were criticized for enrolling us in @entity143 , ballet class and science camp all at once			0
but when you think about it , we " overscheduled " kids might be the uber project managers of the future			0
we 're built to multitask , and we 're not afraid to learn and adapt			0
though mean overall sat scores have gone down a bit since the 1970s , math scores have actually gotten better , according to the @entity154			0
the percentage of students ages 14 to 17 who are enrolled in school has increased over time , from 84 % in 1950 to 94 % in 1970 to 97 % in 2010			0
plus , many more @entity103 children are bilingual now than they were in the past			0
according to the @entity167 , the number of school - age children who spoke a language other than @entity165 at home increased from 4.7 million to 11.2 million between 1980 and 2009 â € ” up from 10 % to 21 %			0
and their @entity165 skills are increasing			0
among children who do n't speak @entity165 at home , the percentage who spoke @entity165 " with difficulty " dropped from 41 % in 1980 to 24 % in 2009			2
we 're the future , like it or not i 'm not denying that we 're facing some huge challenges			0
but that 's an exciting jam to be in			2
it 's likely that a member of our generation will solve some of the questions currently keeping us up at night : will our government ever come together in a spirit of compromise to enact laws that will help us all ? how will the music industry make money despite the overwhelming number of people downloading ? what is our best source of low - cost energy ? how can the journalism industry position itself to create more revenue ? someone will eventually answer those questions or create new industries that render the problems obsolete			1
@entity201 ' time to shine comes at a precipitous moment in history			0
when i was wrestling with a constraining university newspaper budget , a frustrated professor told me , " if you can figure that out , you 'll have saved the journalism industry			0
" why not ? it 's time to stop letting other generations tell us who we are and find out for ourselves			2
are you a millennial who is tired of being counted out ? do you agree with the criticisms of millennials ? share your take in the comments section below			2
