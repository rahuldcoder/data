-- after years of defiantly denying that it was aware of any links between football and brain injuries , the @entity1 reached a surprising settlement with 4,500 former players who sued the organization over concussion - related issues to the tune of $ 765 million			1
if this settlement is approved as is , the @entity1 will have " no admissions of liability or weakness claims			1
" i recall that former @entity19 defensive back ( and my former colleague at @entity21 ) @entity17 's last text message to his family , asking to have his brain examined right before killing himself with a shotgun to the chest			0
i also remember @entity27 safety @entity26 asking me , " how do i feel ? " in a conversation we had , when i mentioned i based my playing style on his			0
years later , @entity26 committed suicide with a gunshot to the head			0
they did n't get any help			0
the good news is that this settlement will put most of the $ 675 million in the hands of my @entity1 brethren and their families who need it the most			1
this would include $ 4 million for those diagnosed after their deaths with a brain condition called chronic traumatic encephalopathy , $ 5 million for men diagnosed with alzheimer 's disease and $ 3 million for players diagnosed with dementia			1
the @entity1 will also pay up to $ 75 million to fund baseline medical exams for the players and will spend $ 10 million on new research into concussion care			1
half of the $ 765 million will be paid in the first three years			1
the second half will be paid out over 17 years			0
this is in part what players wanted -- to financially provide for the worst - off diagnosed players named in the lawsuit as well as providing for all current retired players , regardless of whether they joined the lawsuit or not			2
i always believed that the lawsuit would eventually end in a settlement			0
but in light of last year 's revenue for the @entity1 -- $ 9.5 billion -- i 'm concerned about the other terms of the settlement			1
the core of the concussion lawsuit contends that the " the @entity1 was aware of the evidence and risks associated with traumatic brain injuries for many decades , but deliberately ignored and actively concealed the information from players			1
" i believe the @entity1 more than likely would not have settled with the admission of any liability			1
by not going to trial , the league does not have to face the discovery and deposition process and therefore leaves many questions unanswered			2
if this had gone to trial , the @entity1 would have opened itself up to an extended run of bad pr , potentially billions of dollars in damages , and would have been forced to hand over sensitive internal archives			1
the @entity1 could have been required to produce documents , such as e-mails			2
e-mails are currently at the center of another lawsuit in which a group of former college players led by @entity100 is seeking class action status , challenging the @entity103 's handling of head injuries			0
the @entity103 has until september 13 to respond to the motion to certify the case			0
however , this lawsuit may also be headed toward a settlement			0
just ten days before the @entity1 settlement was announced , the @entity103 agreed to mediation			2
all this leaves the important questions unanswered : how dangerous is football ? how serious are the head injuries ? since the initial filing of the concussion lawsuits , the @entity1 has funded over $ 100 million on numerous outreach and safety programs			1
yet it 's ironic that the final settlement only sets $ 10 million aside for " concussion research			1
" we will never learn what exactly the @entity1 had learned about football - related brain injuries and when they knew it			2
this information could be extremely valuable in future decisions and research on how to treat or prevent concussions			0
moreover , this is information parents of our future football players can use to make informed health decisions			2
in 1994 , then - @entity1 commissioner @entity133 initiated the @entity134 ( @entity134 ) committee , which was led by dr. @entity136			0
he was also the team doctor for the @entity137 at the time			0
@entity136 once cleared wide receiver @entity138 to play after he was knocked unconscious			0
in 2003 , @entity136 was the lead author for nine of 16 studies that minimized the significance of concussions			0
in 2009 , the @entity1 disbanded the @entity134 committee after a series of congressional hearings			0
while @entity136 and the @entity1 may never have to turn over what they knew , the proposed settlement is still pending with an opt - out option for the players , some of whom will appeal and object to the settlement			1
if this happens , the judge will have to seriously consider that four former players have recently sued the @entity1 and its helmet maker , @entity156			2
@entity156 , which is a defendant in the @entity1 concussion lawsuit , is not part of the proposed settlement , so that part of the litigation continues			1
it is unclear how the @entity1 settlement will affect future lawsuits due to the current collective bargaining agreement ( @entity166 )			1
in 2011 , the @entity1 added safety rules ( like no helmet - to - helmet contact ) to the @entity166 , which make it extremely difficult for players to file lawsuits in the future for injuries they have n't sustained yet because players are now made aware of the risks			2
before approving this settlement , the judge will need to take a serious look at the objections made by many players to the agreement , particularly because they will never know what the @entity1 knew about concussions			1
i 've already heard from many players who plan to opt out of the current settlement			1
on october 8 , the @entity187 " documentary , " @entity188 : the @entity1 's @entity191 , " will air and hopefully shed some light on what the @entity1 still has n't revealed			0
hopefully , we will figure out if the settlement is enough			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			0

the @entity1 and former players reached a $ 765 million settlement over concussion issues
@entity202 : i believe the @entity1 would not have settled with the admission of any liability
he says by not going to trial , the @entity1 does not have to have answer many *critical* questions
@entity196 : the current settlement has *flaws* ; we need to ask @entity1 to reveal more information
