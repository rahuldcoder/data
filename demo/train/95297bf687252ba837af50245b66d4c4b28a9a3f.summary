the smell of incense burning and the sound of deep - throated chants greet you at the gate of one of @entity8 's massive stupas , a @entity10 holy place where @entity11 gather to pray			2
for decades , @entity12 has been a safe haven for @entity11 who escape @entity14			1
but @entity11 activists say their people 's peaceful existence here is being disturbed because of @entity14 's growing influence in @entity12			1
@entity12 - born @entity11 @entity20 has lived in @entity12 her whole life , hearing stories from her parents about how her grandparents were killed by the @entity14			1
she says she is overwhelmed with frustration over how tibetans are now being treated in @entity12			0
" since @entity14 has given @entity12 a lot of money , the @entity12 government does n't let tibetans do much of anything			2
they do n't let us gather to mourn , or protest			0
they even pick up tibetans while they are walking on the street and send them to jail , " @entity20 alleged			0
@entity12 is one of the poorest countries in the world , sandwiched between two behemoths : @entity41 and @entity14			1
traditionally , @entity41 has had the biggest influence in @entity12			1
but @entity14 's influence is growing			1
it recently doubled its annual aid to @entity12			0
@entity14 is also building a railway linking the countries and building roads in @entity12 , which is in desperate need of infrastructure			2
@entity12 's prime minister , @entity51 , said @entity14 's biggest interest in @entity12 is the @entity11 issue			1
but he said he and @entity14 premier @entity54 have not specifically discussed repatriating @entity11 who have escaped to @entity12			1
in terms of @entity11 refugees in his country , the prime minister said , " we are not allowing anti-china or @entity60 sentiment on our soil , as per international law			1
" but he denies there is a crackdown on refugees ' rights			0
as @entity14 becomes a bigger factor in @entity12 , refugees from neighboring @entity68 say they are being squeezed			1
@entity20 is one of the few @entity11 willing to talk openly about what is happening			0
inside her home , she worships the @entity72 , the @entity11 spiritual leader loathed by @entity14 and revered as a living @entity74 by many @entity11			2
she also speaks her mind on issues involving @entity68 and has paid a price for it			0
" since 2008 i went to jail many times , 30 times at least , " @entity20 said			0
at home , she keeps a picture of herself being lifted off the ground by several @entity12 police during a protest in 2008			0
she says that 's the year things began changing for the worse for @entity11			0
others , including some @entity12 citizens , say the same thing in hushed whispers			0
2008 was the year of the uprising in @entity68 and subsequent crackdown by @entity14 authorities on @entity11 , which sparked protests across the world and came as @entity99 prepared to host the @entity100			1
at one of the official @entity12 - @entity14 border crossings , trade is the main order of business			1
@entity12 citizens freely travel to @entity14 , and as we found out , the @entity14 freely cross into @entity12 too -- and enforce their rules on @entity12 's territory			1
we were approached by several men in plain clothes , who put their hands over the camera as we tried to film on the border			0
the men were speaking @entity14 to one another and were clearly on the @entity12 side of the border			1
@entity12 's border police were also there			1
their security forces had warned us that if the uniformed @entity14 police came over the bridge , we 'd better watch out because our camera would likely get broken			0
however , the @entity12 forces did n't try to stop us from filming ; nor did they stop the @entity14 men from following us deep into @entity12 's territory			1
the same men later followed us far into the streets of the @entity12 border village , as we tried to talk to people there			0
we left unharmed and with all our equipment intact			0
the @entity133 declined to comment on issues involving @entity68			0
but one border police inspector who did not want to be identified told us above all else , @entity14 's main interest in @entity12 is the @entity11 issue			1
for more than 20 years , the @entity12 government and the @entity139 high commissioner for refugees ( @entity139 ) has had an informal agreement when it comes to @entity11 who make it to @entity12 with or without documentation			2
the @entity12 government agrees to allow @entity11 transit through @entity12 to @entity41 , while @entity139 agrees to facilitate that			1
the current representative in @entity12 says the government has not rescinded that agreement and officials continue to process newly arrived @entity11 to help usher them legally to @entity41			1
the numbers of @entity11 coming to @entity12 has declined dramatically since 2008 , even as reports of unrest and self - immolations by protesting @entity11 continue to leak out of @entity68			2
@entity154 , the @entity139 representative in @entity12 , said annually between 2,000 and 3,000 people crossed over in the late 1990s and early 2000s			0
" it now has been 800 for the last three four years , " @entity154 said , adding that it 's not clear why the numbers have declined			0
@entity11 refugees say they know why			0
@entity14 is exerting pressure on @entity12 so that it is no longer a place of refuge for those trying to escape @entity14 rule , they say			2
a @entity14 foreign ministry spokesman said " @entity12 sticks to the one - @entity14 policy " and considers @entity68 a part of @entity14			2
" we will not allow any party to conduct @entity172 policies in @entity12 , " spokesman @entity168 said			0
@entity14 believes and hopes that @entity12 will continue to adhere to that commitment in the future			2
