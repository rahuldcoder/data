the crash of a small plane in @entity2 appears to be a familiar story : a pilot not authorized to fly in foul weather meanders into a foggy soup and tries to land			1
but in other respects , tuesday 's crash is anything but ordinary			0
the doomed @entity14 pilot flies to a major airport apparently without radioing controllers			0
and when the plane crashes just off a main runway , erupting in fire , the crash goes undetected			1
on wednesday , the @entity22 painted some broad outlines to an accident picture that is begging for specific details			1
@entity22 investigator @entity26 said the @entity22 is focusing on a seven - hour window in which the @entity28 crashed along runway @entity29 at @entity31			1
the crash , he said , occurred sometime between 2 a.m. -- when an airport worker conducted a routine runway check -- and 8:45 a.m. -- when a taxiing aircraft reported seeing " debris on the runway			1
" rescue workers were dispatched and found the plane 's sole occupant dead amid the fire - scarred wreckage			1
" at this point we have no idea the exact time ( of the crash ) , " @entity26 said			1
@entity26 said the safety board had not yet determined whether the pilot attempted to contact air traffic controllers			1
" we will look at everything in the investigation , and that does include air traffic control , " he said			0
the pilot was @entity54 , according to a source at the @entity57 - based @entity56 , which owns the plane			1
the source spoke on condition of anonymity			0
the club previously said the pilot was a club member who rented the plane and planned to return it the next day			1
the accident is " certainly a little unusual , to say the least , " said @entity67 , president of the @entity68 and @entity69			0
" to have an airplane , even a small airplane , crash at a major airport and go unnoticed for quite a while does seem unusual , " said @entity70 , former director of the @entity22 's @entity71			1
both men say the dense fog , which may have contributed to the crash , likely prevented controllers from seeing the incident			1
the control tower is roughly one mile from the end of @entity29 , the crash site			1
but they said the crash raises intriguing questions about the actions of the pilot and controllers			2
" my biggest question is @entity92 ? why was the pilot there ? why was n't he talking to anybody ? " said @entity67			2
aircraft are required to communicate with controllers when entering controlled airspace			0
" whether it 's day or night , when you 're approaching an airport of this size and density , you have to start contacting controllers well in advance , usually from about 25 miles out ... to let them know you 're arriving , " @entity70 said			0
if the pilot was unfamiliar with @entity2 airport 's frequencies , he could have used a universal frequency to contact controllers , @entity67 said			2
both men speculated that the pilot could have strayed into foul weather and been too preoccupied with flying the plane to contact the tower			1
the @entity116 said the tower had normal staffing early tuesday , but it declined to specify the number of controllers on duty			0
@entity67 and @entity70 said the accident also raises questions about the air traffic controllers			0
" how did the airplane get to the airport without the controller saying , ' hey what is this guy doing out there ? ' " @entity67 said			0
said @entity70 : " certainly this is an airport that has very good facilities			0
it has radar ; it has lots of capabilities and how an aircraft could approach , possibly circle , we 're hearing , then crash short of the runway , unnoticed for so long , does raise some questions			2
" @entity144 , president of @entity56 , said the pilot , who was unaccompanied , rented the club plane for an overnight trip			2
" it is not usual for this individual to rent an airplane overnight , " he said			0
the pilot was certified to fly under " visual flight rules , " allowing him to fly in fair weather , and was qualified to fly at night			2
but the pilot did not have an instrument rating allowing him to fly into weather systems , @entity144 said			0
@entity144 said @entity2 airport officials told him the pilot " circled " over the airport " for some time " and that the plane crashed while trying to land about 2:30 a.m. " they 've indicated to us that they have tapes of him circling and that the time of his demise was about 2:30 , " he said			1
airport officials have declined to discuss the accident in detail , citing the @entity22 investigation			2
the @entity173 , in a statement , said " the time of the crash has not been determined and reports to the contrary are not factual			2
these facts will be determined as part of the @entity22 investigation			0
" on wednesday , the @entity22 surveyed the crash site , investigator @entity26 said			1
he plans to examine air traffic control tapes and radar soon			0
and the @entity22 will examine the pilot 's flight records and interview his instructors			1
the investigation , @entity26 said , is in the early stages , and it may take a year before the board determines a probable cause			0
asked whether this wreck was anomalous , @entity26 said , " every accident 's unusual			0
" @entity194 plane returns to @entity2 after striking birds			0

investigator says plane crashed some time after 2 a.m. , was n't noticed until 8:45 a.m.
pilot may not have been in contact with control tower
@entity22 : single - *engine* @entity28 crashed unnoticed at @entity31
there was a dense fog the night of the crash , but investigators *unsure* if it was factor
