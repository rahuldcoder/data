-- in @entity3 legend they are known as @entity4 -- the divine winds -- a reference to two mighty typhoons placed providentially seven years apart which , in the 13th century , destroyed two separate @entity10 invasion fleets so large they were not eclipsed until the d - day landings of @entity13 marine archaeologists now say they have uncovered the remains of a ship from the second fleet in 1281 -- believed to have comprised 4,400 vessels -- a meter below the seabed , in 25 meters of water off the coast of @entity23 , @entity3			1
scientists are hoping they will be able to recreate the complete @entity26 vessel from @entity28 's lost fleet using a 12 - meter - long section of keel			1
the @entity31 ruled @entity32 from 1271 to 1368			0
according to @entity34 , a professor of archaeology at @entity37 's @entity36 , and head of the research team , the section could go a long way to helping researchers identify all the characteristics of the 20 - meter warship			2
" this discovery was of major importance for our research , " @entity34 told a news conference			0
" we are planning to expand search efforts and find further information that can help us restore the whole ship			0
" discovered using ultrasound equipment , the research team says it is the first wreck from the period to have an intact hull , the planks of which are still attached to the keel with nails			2
scientists say its good state of preservation -- they were even able to establish that the planks were originally painted a whitish - gray -- is due to the fact it has been covered by sand			0
" i believe we will be able to understand more about shipbuilding skills at the time as well as the actual situation of exchanges in @entity73 , " @entity34 told reporters in @entity23			0
how to survive a shipwreck more than 4,000 artifacts , including ceramic shards , bricks used for ballast , cannonballs and stone anchors have been found in the vicinity of the wreck , linking it to the @entity26 invasion fleet			1
@entity34 said there were no immediate plans to salvage the hull and the first step was to conserve the find by covering the sites with nets			0
the @entity92 -- perhaps better known as the nickname given to the @entity3 suicide pilots of the @entity95 -- were a nation - defining event for @entity3 and set the limits of @entity10 expansion in the east			2
historians say the first @entity32 attempt to invade @entity3 in 1274 ended in disaster			2
having initially engaged a numerically superior @entity3 samurai force at the @entity105 in @entity106 , the @entity32 retreated to their fleet of 300 ships and some 500 smaller craft after just one day of battle on land			1
a typhoon destroyed a third of the fleet that night and the remnants limped back to port in @entity117 which was then a vassal state of @entity32			0
seven years later , @entity28 amassed an impressive armada of 4,400 ships carrying 40,000 @entity121 , @entity10 and @entity32 troops in a bid to finally subjugate @entity3			1
the @entity3 , convinced of a second invasion , had spent the intervening years building strategic seawalls which made it difficult for the @entity32 to land			1
unable to gain a beachhead after initially taking the island of @entity130 and @entity131 , the fleet was decimated by a two - day typhoon that hit the @entity133			0
it is believed about 80 % of the fleet was destroyed and the @entity28 's troops either drowned at sea or slaughtered on the beaches by samurai			1
according to a contemporary account cited in the book " @entity28 's lost fleet : in @entity150 , " by maritime archaeologist @entity151 , the losses were so great that " a person could walk across from one point of land to another on a mass of wreckage " .			1

marine archaeologists have found a shipwreck *dating* from the 13th century off the coast of @entity3
the vessel is thought to have been part of @entity28 's massive invasion fleet
more than 4,000 artifacts , including *pottery* shards , cannonballs and anchors were found near the wreck
