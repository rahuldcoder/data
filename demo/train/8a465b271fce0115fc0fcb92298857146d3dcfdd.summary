@entity0 -- president @entity2 and congressional leaders will discuss the looming fiscal cliff impasse friday at the @entity5 , aiming for a last - minute deal to stave off automatic tax increases and spending cuts			1
the 3 p.m. meeting -- which will include @entity2 , vice president @entity10 , house speaker @entity11 , @entity5 minority leader @entity12 , senate majority leader @entity13 and @entity15 minority leader @entity14 -- will come days before the deadline to reach a deal , and after another day of @entity18 and @entity19 blaming each other for the stalemate			1
@entity5 spokeswoman @entity22 confirmed the meeting , but did not elaborate			2
@entity11 spokesman @entity24 and @entity26 spokesman @entity25 both tried to put the onus on their rival political party -- in the former case urging the @entity31 - led @entity15 to pass a bill approved by the @entity18 majority in the @entity5 , and in the latter asking for a detailed proposal from @entity2			1
earlier thursday , @entity26 said his side wo n't " write a blank check for anything @entity19 put forward just because we find ourselves at the edge of the cliff			2
" while a @entity15 @entity31 leadership member said such details would be forthcoming , two @entity5 officials said @entity2 will not send a fiscal cliff measure to @entity46			1
@entity13 , the @entity48 @entity47 , argued that @entity18 undermined a potentially major agreement over the past two years by refusing to compromise on their opposition to higher tax rates for the wealthy			2
hours before friday 's meeting was announced , he was doubtful there would be a deal by january 1			1
" i do n't know , time-wise , how it can happen now , " @entity13 said			2
democrats , @entity18 challenge each other to act first the @entity58 sank thursday amid growing fears the sides wo n't come together			0
if they do n't , economists have warned it could cause another recession			0
fiscal cliff fears jolt consumer confidence at the least , hopes for an imminent so - called grand bargain that would address chronic federal deficits and debt appeared dashed right now , leaving it to the @entity5 and legislators to work out a less ambitious agreement			2
the principal dispute continues to be over taxes , specifically the demand by @entity2 and @entity19 to extend most of the tax cuts passed under president @entity76 while allowing higher rates of the 1990s to return on top income brackets			2
@entity2 campaigned for re-election on keeping the current lower tax rates on family income up to $ 250,000 , which he argues would protect 98 % of @entity82 and 97 % of small businesses from rates that increase on income above that level			2
@entity18 oppose any kind of increase in tax rates , and @entity11 suffered the political indignity last week of offering a compromise -- a $ 1 million threshold for the higher rates to kick in -- that his @entity18 colleagues refused to support because it raised taxes and had no chance of passing the @entity15			1
fiscal cliff a self - inflicted problem last friday , the president proposed the scaled - back agreement that included his call for extending tax cuts on households with incomes under $ 250,000 , as well as an extension of unemployment insurance			2
@entity26 told @entity2 in a telephone conversation wednesday that he must see details of a proposal before he can figure out how to proceed on a @entity15 vote			1
however , a senior @entity31 @entity15 source said thursday that @entity26 must first work things out with @entity5 speaker @entity11 before @entity19 divulge more			1
such squabbling has left many doubtful there will be a deal before the fiscal cliff takes effect			0
@entity13 criticized @entity11 's insistence the @entity15 act on @entity5 measures , saying @entity19 and @entity18 have to agree on something together			1
" we are in the same situation we 've been in for a long time , " @entity13 said			0
" we ca n't negotiate with ourselves			0
" both sides play the ' blame game ' @entity13 said @entity11 wants to wait until after the new @entity5 re-elects him as speaker early next month before proceeding with a compromise -- one that will need support from both @entity19 and @entity18 to pass			1
@entity11 is " more concerned about his speakership than putting the country on firm financial footing , " @entity13 claimed			1
in response , @entity11 spokesman @entity135 said @entity13 should stop talking and instead take up legislation passed by the @entity5 to avert the fiscal cliff			1
this comes a day after @entity11 's leadership team issued a statement saying the @entity15 must go first -- either by passing or amending the @entity5 - passed proposal -- and only then will they act , an assertion @entity24 repeated thursday evening			1
@entity13 and @entity19 reject the @entity18 proposals , which would extend all tax cuts passed under former president @entity76 and revamp the spending cuts of the fiscal cliff			2
they 've called them insufficient , shifting too much deficit reduction burden on the middle class			0
instead , @entity13 called on @entity11 to allow a vote on a @entity15 - passed measure to implement @entity2 's plan to extend tax cuts to the $ 250,000 threshold			1
however , @entity26 rejected that possibility thursday , as he sought to focus the debate on revising @entity5 - passed measures			1
one possibility is the fiscal cliff takes effect and taxes go up in january , then @entity46 steps in to bring tax rates back down for at least some people -- allowing them to say they 're lowering taxes , even if taxes for some wealthy people are higher in 2013 than they were in 2012			0
but retiring @entity169 rep. @entity169 of @entity170 calls that scenario little more than a political game			0
" nobody is willing to pull the trigger ( because ) everybody wants to play the blame game , " @entity169 said			0
" this blame game is about to put us over the edge			0
" opinion : art that calls the fiscal cliff 's bluff polls show most back @entity2 @entity2 and @entity19 have leverage , based on the president 's re-election last month and @entity31 gains in the @entity5 and @entity15 in the new @entity46			1
in addition , polls consistently show majority support for @entity2 's position on taxes			1
the @entity195 daily tracking poll released wednesday showed 54 % of respondents support @entity2 's handling of the fiscal cliff talks , compared with 26 % who approve of @entity11 's performance			1
" we believe very strongly a reasonable package can get majorities in both ( chambers ) , " a senior @entity5 official said			0
" the only thing that would prevent it is if sen. @entity26 and speaker @entity11 do n't cooperate			1
" @entity82 less optimistic of fiscal cliff deal anti-tax crusader @entity209 has vowed to back primary challenges against republicans who violate his widely signed pledge not to raise taxes			2
even if a deal is reached , he predicts budget showdowns will continue -- every time the government needs more money to operate			0
" there the @entity18 have a lot of clout because they can say we 'll let you run the government for the next month , but you 've got to make these reforms , " he said this week			0
on wednesday , treasury secretary @entity225 told @entity46 the government would reach its borrowing limit at year 's end , but could take steps to create what he called " headroom " for two months or so			0
however , @entity225 said uncertainty about the fiscal cliff and deficit negotiations make it hard to predict precisely how long government measures to address the situation will last			0
crisis two years in the making the possibility of a fiscal cliff was set in motion over the past two years as a way to force action on mounting government debt			0
now , legislators risk looking politically cynical by seeking to weaken the measures enacted to try to force them to confront tough questions regarding deficit reduction , such as changes to government programs like @entity253 , @entity254 and @entity255			0
the two sides seemingly had made progress early last week on forging a $ 2 trillion deficit reduction deal that included new revenue sought by @entity2 and spending cuts and entitlement changes desired by @entity11			1
@entity2 's latest offer set $ 400,000 as the income threshold for a tax rate increase , up from his original plan of $ 250,000			2
it also had a new formula for the consumer price index -- called chained @entity269 -- that wraps in new assumptions on consumer habits in response to rising prices , such as seeking cheaper alternatives , and would result in smaller benefit increases			0
statistics supplied by opponents say the change would mean @entity253 recipients would get $ 6,000 less in benefits over the first 15 years of chained @entity269			0
liberal groups have openly challenged the plan , calling it a betrayal of senior citizens who contributed all their lives for their benefits			0
@entity11 appeared to move on increased tax revenue , including higher rates on top income brackets and eliminating deductions and loopholes			0
but his inability to rally all @entity5 @entity18 behind his plan last week raised questions about his role and what comes next			0
@entity13 and other @entity19 say @entity5 @entity18 must accept that an agreement will require support from legislators in both parties , rather than the @entity18 majority in the @entity5 pushing through a measure on its own			1
some @entity5 @entity18 have said they would join @entity19 and support the president 's plan in hopes of moving past the volatile issue to focus on spending cuts and entitlement reforms they seek			1
will fiscal cliff hurt the economy ? @entity312 's @entity311 and @entity1 's @entity313 , @entity314 , @entity315 , @entity316 , @entity317 , @entity318 and @entity319 contributed to this report .			0
