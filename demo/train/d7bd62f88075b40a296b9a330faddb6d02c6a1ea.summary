their challenge is the @entity3			1
professional climbers @entity4 and @entity6 are in the middle of tackling this most difficult of challenges at @entity10 's @entity9			1
there are many routes up @entity9 , a 3,000 - foot - tall granite monolith that has long beckoned thrillseekers			2
but only a handful have been attempted by climbers trying to free climb -- using only their hands and feet -- with ropes designed only to catch them when they fall			1
and perhaps no route is more challenging than the @entity3 , which offers few footholds and may be the most difficult climb in the world			1
a @entity10 official confirmed that if they succeed , @entity4 and @entity6 would be the first to successfully free - climb the smooth cliff face			1
that 's why @entity4 and @entity6 have spent several years planning and practicing their climb , assembling a support team that helps feed and care for them as they make their way up the wall			0
they chose to climb in winter so their hands wo n't sweat and there 's more friction between their rubber soles and the rock			2
they relieve themselves in plastic bags			0
they sleep at night in pitched tents suspended on the wall , with @entity4 waking up twice per night to apply lotion to his hands			0
they 've already been on the wall for more than 10 days			0
if all goes well , the climb should take a total of two to three weeks			0
follow their journey on @entity4 and @entity6 's @entity61 accounts , @entity4 and @entity6 's @entity63 accounts and @entity64 .			0

two professional climbers are tackling @entity9 's *biggest* challenge
the @entity3 is a sheer cliff face in @entity10
they are only using their hands and feet to climb upwards
