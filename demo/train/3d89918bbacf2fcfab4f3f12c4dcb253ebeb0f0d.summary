@entity0 -- let 's hear it for " the man of the moment , the man of the millennium			0
" that man is @entity7 , and those are the words with which an @entity10 public servant introduced @entity12 's prime minister in @entity13 on sunday			1
" @entity7 , @entity7 , @entity7 , " chanted the crowd			1
the adulation did n't end there			0
the next day , @entity7 was in @entity17 , delivering a speech to an audience of 16,000 at the @entity20			2
" you 're a rock star ! " shrieked an excited fan as the event beamed across millions of television screens in @entity12 and around the world			2
and so it was that # @entity27 and # @entity28 began trending on @entity29			0
tuesday : new city , new audience			0
@entity7 pitched up at the @entity10 @entity32 in @entity33			2
he spoke in @entity34 this time , highlighting the linguistic and cultural commonalities between @entity12 and @entity10 -- almost as if to suggest @entity12 was a better trading partner than @entity38			1
" @entity10 has immense opportunities to participate in @entity12 's progress			1
... @entity12 will be the answer to your search for new economic opportunities , " @entity7 declared			1
is @entity12 really the one - stop answer ? and is @entity7 really the man of the millennium ? the hype seems to be reaching dangerous levels			1
there 's no denying that @entity7 has generated immense excitement in @entity12 and abroad			1
here , finally , is an @entity12 leader who says the things @entity12 have been yearning to hear			2
he talks about faster growth , creating jobs , about a smartphone in every hand , a toilet in every home , clean streets , leaner and more transparent government			2
and boy , can he talk			0
in @entity61 , in @entity60 , in @entity34 , @entity7 seems to know exactly what his audience wants to hear			2
in that sense he is indeed a rock star , riffing on his key anthems at every big speech			0
but can he deliver the runaway platinum sales @entity12 now seem to expect ? we 're beginning to see the first signs of questions being asked			2
earlier this month , at the sidelines of the @entity73 in @entity0 , top industrialist @entity71 told @entity1 that @entity7 's " honeymoon period is over			1
" when @entity1 spoke with @entity12 finance minister @entity75 , he seemed to dial back on expectations of big reforms , saying " people with their sense of wisdom will be able to appreciate " the cumulative effect of the government 's smaller steps			1
and then there are the questions of @entity7 himself			2
at the inauguration of a hospital in @entity89 last month , @entity7 made a speech , played out live on many @entity12 tv channels			1
curiously , one bit was ignored by the @entity12 press			2
speaking of the @entity95 god @entity94 -- who is depicted as having an elephant 's head -- @entity7 claimed that @entity94 's half - man , half - elephant body was evidence that ancient @entity12 doctors were experts at the art of plastic surgery			1
seriously ? the @entity12 tv anchor and journalist @entity104 was one of the few to raise an eyebrow			0
" he believes in digital @entity12 , wants to import bullet trains and ' make in @entity12 ' state - of - the - art ( defense ) weaponry , " @entity104 wrote			0
" these are 21st - century ambitions			0
how does all of that sit alongside this belief in unverified mythology ? " he added , " the silence of the media is deeply disturbing			0
it feels as though it 's been deliberately blanked out by everyone			0
" i doubt there 's a larger media conspiracy only to portray @entity7 positively			1
but the media do need to take a step back and question the rock - star levels of adulation			0
@entity7 has gotten @entity12 dreaming			1
who knows , those dreams may even be realized one day			0
but in @entity7 's seven months as prime minister so far , rhetoric and big plans aside , nothing has really changed			1
for hundreds of millions of poor @entity12 , it is still the same @entity12			0
basic infrastructure is still subpar ; there are no social safety nets on health care or pensions ; @entity12 is still an immensely frustrating place to live and work			0
and that 's the tip of an enormous iceberg			0
@entity12 could take decades to change			1
we all need to remember that			0
so do @entity7 's fans .			1

@entity7 , @entity12 's prime minister , *continues* to draw *praise* for his speeches
@entity153 says the prime minister talks about the issues that matter , particularly jobs
he says some people think it 's time to match rhetoric with action
@entity153 : people should have realistic expectations ; it may take decades to change @entity12
