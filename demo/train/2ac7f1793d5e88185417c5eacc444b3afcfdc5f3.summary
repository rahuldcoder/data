-- nearly half of the nation 's states have new voting measures that could stop some @entity6 from heading to the polls in november , a civil rights group said monday			1
" this year , an unprecedented number of voting restrictions impose barriers to voting that disproportionately affect the @entity18 community , " said a report from @entity9 , which has also sued to block such voting measures in a number of states			1
monday 's report from the organization , which pushes to protect voting rights , was the latest volley in a national battle over such measures that splits largely along party lines			1
@entity9 's report points to three different types of efforts in 23 states that it says will impact eligible @entity18 voters : efforts to purge rolls of non-citizen voters , proof of citizenship requirements for voter registration and photo id laws			1
campaigns battle over narrow groups of voters it is difficult to calculate exactly how many @entity6 could be affected , @entity42 , director of voter protection for @entity9 , told reporters in a conference call monday			2
based on @entity48 population data of eligible @entity18 voters in the 23 states with what @entity9 calls " voter suppression policies , " she said , the organization estimates that obstacles could deter or prevent more than 10 million @entity18 citizens from registering and voting in the 2012 elections			1
@entity55 steps up effort to woo @entity18 voters but one conservative @entity18 leader said monday that the group 's estimate sounds " completely ridiculous			1
" " it is a number that simply is not believable , " said @entity61 , an advisory committee member for the @entity62 and a former treasurer of the @entity64 during president @entity66 's administration			1
@entity9 said its figure was a conservative estimate , pointing to letters it says @entity72 officials sent to thousands of registered voters asking them to prove their citizenship or be purged from the voting rolls			1
the intimidating impact of such letters extends far beyond those directly involved , @entity42 said monday			2
" discrimination works that way , " she said			0
" it exponentially affects the entire community			2
" and , she said , it can influence the results of the election			0
but @entity61 said voter id laws were a positive step			0
" it 's something very important so that we have integrity of the vote			0
when it is not done , there are questions about whether in reality people have the right to vote , " she said			0
" when we have the identification it eliminates the need for any questions			0
" @entity9 's report said the organization 's arguments are based on an analysis of government documents and data , media reports and scholarly works			1
the organization has been involved in a number of legal challenges to recent state voting measures , including a high - profile case over @entity118 's controversial voter id law , which requires voters to present a state - issued photo id			1
earlier this month , the @entity121 sent the lawsuit back to a lower court to assess the availability of alternative forms of identification and whether the new law disenfranchises voters			0
the law 's backers argue that it strengthens voting procedures and protects against fraud			2
gov. @entity134 , a @entity135 , signed the law in march after its passage largely along party lines			0
he said it " sets a simple and clear standard to protect the integrity of our elections			0
" @entity143 approves @entity145 voter law in its report monday , @entity9 countered that evidence shows that in - person voter fraud is " virtually nonexistent			0
" " this is an overly broad method of trying to solve a problem that does n't even exist that has a disparate impact on people of color , " @entity42 said			0
debate over the @entity118 measure and other similar efforts across the country has largely split along party lines			0
@entity135 supporters have argued that the laws would help to fight fraud , while @entity163 make the case that the new measures aid @entity135 in the voting booth by limiting minority turnout in crucial battleground states			1
@entity0 's @entity169 , @entity170 and the @entity171 contributed to this report .			2

a new report is the latest volley in a battle over state voting rules
such measures " disproportionately affect the @entity18 community , " group says
the civil rights group is involved in lawsuits challenging the laws
a conservative @entity18 leader says the report 's *assertion* is " not believable "
