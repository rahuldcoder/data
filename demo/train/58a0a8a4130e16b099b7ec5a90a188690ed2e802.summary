the @entity2 's health exchange website offers a slew of organizations in place to help people sign up for coverage			1
there 's just one problem : this week , the list included businesses whose owners have no idea how to give @entity15 health insurance advice			1
" i can fix your car , but i do n't think i can fix your health , " @entity17 of @entity18 told @entity19 on wednesday			2
@entity17 said they were surprised when their @entity25 business started receiving calls yesterday about the @entity27			2
the health insurance marketplace opened on october 1 , providing a navigator with a 230 - page list of agency locations and site schedules in @entity2 , including phone numbers to call with health insurance inquiries			1
the list intentionally includes details for places like coffee shops where , even if they 're not a place you 'd normally associate with health care , people can meet with advisers who can guide them toward a plan , @entity2 state health department spokesman @entity35 explained			1
yet in some cases , addresses and phone numbers for such advisers were listed incorrectly , @entity35 said			0
in other cases , the information is correct but the " navigator " ( the person who can lead individuals through the health care process ) did n't tell the proprietors of the listed meeting place about it			1
either way , the state spokesman said these errors do n't appear to be pervasive or statewide			1
even if they are fixed by week 's end , as @entity35 promised , the errors by then already will have caused plenty of headaches -- like for @entity68 , manager of @entity69			0
he said his shop has received an additional 25 calls per day since the beginning of october -- just not because of an increased interest in their sweet confections			0
@entity77 manager @entity76 told @entity19 they were confused by the @entity27 - related calls they received , but did n't put two and two together until members of the media showed up outside their @entity25 location wednesday			2
" first , we thought it was kind of a joke , " @entity83 said			0
@entity88 manager @entity87 said his establishment too has been getting calls			0
according to @entity87 , the @entity92 pharmacy usually gets two to three calls per day			0
but since october 1 , @entity87 said he 's personally answered more than 50 additional calls each day from @entity15 inquiring about health insurance			2
at first , the callers are confused , but then get " very frustrated " when they realize they 're not speaking to an @entity27 navigator , @entity87 said			0
@entity87 , who filed a complaint with the @entity100 , said he is also frustrated because the misguided phone calls distract him from the pharmacy 's business			2
" they interrupt my work , " @entity87 said			0
@entity68 said he informed the state health department about the mistake , but said they are still receiving the calls			1
on the bright side , @entity69 employees are hopeful the extra calls will result in more cupcake sales , he said			0
" we ca n't help with @entity27 , but we 're pretty good with cupcakes around here ; so we do offer those in lieu of some health care options , " @entity68 said , laughing .			1

the errors are n't pervasive or statewide , a state health spokesman says
@entity2 businesses *unrelated* to health care have gotten calls about @entity27
calls result from incorrect list on @entity2 's health exchange website
a pharmacist on list has filed complaint after *multiple* calls per day
