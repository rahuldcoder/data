for many travelers , jetsetting lost its glamorous allure decades ago			0
still , there are a handful of holdouts who still view flying through the lens of seductive aviation epics like " @entity9 "			0
for the likes of @entity11 and @entity12 and @entity13 , the charm of aviation 's golden era can be resurrected through their plane - themed collections			1
@entity11 , for instance , has amassed over 1,000 cabin crew uniforms , which he keeps stored at his home			1
his collection spans seven continents and as many decades			2
" at the moment , i want to have them with me , but eventually i would like to make a book -- maybe a coffee table book			0
to do that , though , i need a big bag of money , " he says			0
the @entity29 , who wed inside a concorde four years ago , make @entity33 's collection look tame			1
the couple , who met online and soon bonded over their shared love of plane paraphernalia , spent Â£ 40,000 ( $ 67,000 ) converting their home in @entity40 , @entity41 into a @entity43 airplane , complete with a flight simulator			1
" the corridor used to be full of aircraft parts			0
we had to cut a door for the flight deck in the bathroom , " admits @entity13			1
the collection grew so big that the couple eventually had to outsource it to an office space down the street			1
they have since started charging fellow flight fanatics for the chance to try out the simulator ( they dub it the @entity61 )			2
" we wanted people to feel like they were boarding a real aircraft			0
it adds to the whole experience , " says @entity13 .			2
