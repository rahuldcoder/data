@entity0 , @entity1 -- during the @entity5 regime , i was put in prison at the age of 15 for picking mushrooms in the rice fields to feed my pregnant sister			1
under the @entity5 , everything belonged to the revolution — and picking up anything from the ground without their permission was a crime			1
for several hours in front of about one hundred villagers , the @entity5 publicly tortured me			1
i did not cry , because i was told not to			2
then , they put me in prison			2
months later , after running out of lies to tell the prison chief while begging for my life , one of the older prisoners stepped forward and pleaded to the prison chief on my behalf			1
surprisingly , the prison chief agreed and i was released			2
i came to learn much later , however , that in exchange for me , they killed him			2
my experience is a mere footnote to the millions of other @entity1 who suffered and died at the hands of this regime , but it is illustrative of the ongoing struggle to find justice and closure			2
35 years on , top @entity5 leaders face justice in @entity1 trial ' will not bring back the dead ' when the verdict is announced in the first trial of the @entity5 tribunal 's second case , there will be no winners and no cause for celebration			1
while the occasion marks an enormous achievement in @entity1 and the international community 's long struggle to assert the primacy of human rights , peace , and the rule of law , it is a victory that can only be marked with somber contemplation			1
we have come a long way in forging an international system to meet the challenge of responding to and punishing mass atrocities , but judgments do not bring back the dead or restore trust			1
no action can assuage the anguish , sadness , and regret that haunts the survivors to this day			0
over 35 years after the fall of the @entity5 regime , we still see the effects from this period in almost every facet of @entity1 society			1
from physical scars and disabilities , to trauma and psychosocial conditions , the horrors of this period continue to manifest themselves in survivors , families , communities and institutions			0
suffering under the @entity5 many estimates found that more than a million people died under the @entity5 between 1975 and 1979 from execution , disease , starvation and overwork			2
see places where @entity1 's shocking past is on show like many families , my mother , my deaf sister , @entity101 , and i , all suffered under the @entity5			1
and my mother lost all three of her brothers , one sister , one daughter and many grandchildren under the regime			0
nearly 60 of our family members are still missing today			0
society is still divided , and the memories of this period — even memories of kindness — carry a heavy burden			0
i will never forget the kind act of the man in prison			1
i do not even know the name of the man who saved my life			0
i have been searching for his family members for years , in the hope that i can pay my respect for the courage and kindness he showed me			0
' too little , too late ' achieving true justice in these circumstances is an impossible feat for mankind , and an altogether late endeavor at best			0
time and again , the international community has watched mass atrocities , genocide , and other heinous crimes proceed unchecked			0
interactive : five faces of @entity1 's @entity5 while our efforts in applying due process in the punishment of genocide and mass atrocities deserve recognition and respect , we should not overlook the paramount need for preventing such crimes before they occur			1
@entity149 must be the watchword in defining our struggle , and our struggle against evil must begin with courage			0
we must have the courage to call out inhumanity when it occurs and take steps that prevent such crimes , rather than responding to their aftermath			0
we must seize the opportunity to stand up for what is right , no matter the circumstance , because we know that saving millions of lives today speaks far greater for our civilization than issuing verdicts tomorrow			0
this verdict regarding the two senior @entity5 leaders matters a great deal to me , as should it for all @entity1 , because it gives some closure -- but closure is too little , too late for many			1
if only the international community would exercise the courage and resolve as the man in prison did for me , the world would need fewer verdicts			0
in 2013 : infamous leader during @entity1 genocide dies			2

@entity180 was 15 when he survived *imprisonment* by @entity5
an older prisoner stepped forward to save him who was later killed for his kind act
verdict in @entity1 over two senior @entity5 leaders does *n't* bring back dead
but verdict is enormous achievement in @entity1
