@entity0 -- every few years , i reassess how i feel about @entity3 who wave @entity6 flags			1
much of it has to do with who is doing the waving and under what circumstances			0
in 2006 , i wrote a column saying it was a bad idea for immigration reform advocates to wave @entity6 flags as they marched through @entity14 cities such as @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
it 's illogical to show your allegiance to one country while demanding accommodation from another			1
but in 2007 , i penned another column after attending a @entity27 concert in @entity28 where fans of the @entity6 singer unfurled @entity6 flags			1
nothing wrong with that , i concluded			0
it 's all about context			0
there is a big difference between a political protest and a concert			0
now , thanks to @entity14 @entity40 medalist @entity39 , and what i consider to be the misguided and ill - mannered way he chose to celebrate his silver medal in the 1500 - meters final , i get the chance to think through the subject of flag - waving once again			1
after @entity39 finished his race and secured his medal , he did what athletes typically do at the @entity40			1
he held up his country 's flag -- the @entity53			2
the 27 - year - old was born in @entity6 , but the @entity14 is his country now			1
his father migrated here illegally from the city of @entity57			0
@entity39 was brought here when he was 4			2
like most immigrants , they came in search of greater opportunity			0
and they found it -- for themselves , and their children			0
that little boy eventually became a @entity14 citizen			2
and then , after a lot of hard work and thousands of hours of training , he got the chance to represent his country and compete in the @entity40			1
and , to put the cherry on the sundae , he actually wins a silver medal			0
the last time an @entity14 won a medal of any kind in the 1500 meters was 44 years ago			2
you ca n't help but be proud of @entity39 and the country that allowed him the opportunity to fulfill his potential			1
so why did @entity39 carry two flags with him on his victory lap ? as the world looked on , he held up both the @entity14 flag and the @entity6 flag			1
and not a good idea			1
@entity39 posted messages on @entity89 throughout the competition -- in @entity91 and @entity92			2
after his victory , he tweeted , " @entity94 , still felt like i won ! representing two countries @entity14 and @entity6 ! " that 's funny			1
i only saw one set of letters on his jersey : @entity14			1
later , he said to the media that he was honored to represent the @entity14 and @entity6			1
i realize that , for many of my fellow @entity3 , the image of @entity39 waving two flags is no big thing			1
and for many @entity14 who are @entity6 - born , it 's actually a great thing			1
both camps might even find the gesture charming -- albeit , for different reasons			0
most @entity6 - @entity14 i know would need a whole team of therapists to sort out their views on culture , national identity , ethnic pride and their relationship with mother @entity6			1
they 're the orphans of the @entity121 -- too @entity6 for the @entity14 , too @entity14 for the @entity6			1
their positive reaction to the photo has less to do with @entity39 than with their own sense of displacement			2
many @entity6 who came to the @entity14 -- particularly those who came as professionals or became professionals once they got here -- look to @entity6 with a mixture of affection and guilt			1
they romanticize what they left behind and find it easier to love the country from hundreds or thousands of miles away			0
they may live in the @entity14 , but many of them still consider themselves children of @entity6 -- the kind who run away from home			1
for both groups , the fact that @entity39 , who holds dual citizenship , made a decision to show off the flags of both countries was a kind of signal to the people of @entity6 that this accomplished young man had n't forgotten where he came from			1
for some , that concept warms the heart			0
but the image did n't warm my heart			0
understand , i 've been called a @entity6 separatist , a racist who hates anyone who is n't @entity6 or @entity3 , someone who is obsessed with his ethnicity			2
in fact , i ca n't remember the last time someone accused me of not being proud of being @entity6 or @entity3			2
and in the past 20 years , i 've written hundreds of thousands of words in defense of @entity6 and @entity3			2
that said , the photo bothered me			0
some people will insist that this is @entity39 's choice to make , that it was his sweat and sacrifice that got him to @entity181 , and this was his victory to celebrate however he saw fit			1
they 're focused on the individual			0
but the last thing the @entity40 is about is the individual			2
it 's about being part of a team -- the @entity189			0
it 's about national pride , not ego			0
@entity39 was n't there to compete for himself but to represent his country			1
all he had to do was decide which country that was			0
he chose not to choose			0
what am i missing ? where were the @entity200 - @entity14 athletes waving the @entity200 flag , or the @entity203 waving the @entity205 flag ? i did n't see that			2
i remember that , in 1992 , @entity3 boxer @entity207 held up both the @entity14 and @entity6 flags after winning a gold medal in @entity210			1
but that was largely symbolic since @entity207 was born in the @entity14			2
he was n't an immigrant caught between two countries			0
@entity215 ( with all due respect ) , you should be proud of your accomplishment			0
but when you 're an @entity40 athlete , you do n't get to have your cake and eat it , too			2
sooner or later , you have to choose which country you 're going to represent			0
you made that choice , when you put on the jersey for @entity223			1
it was n't unlike the choice your parents made when they chose the @entity14 over @entity6 a quarter century ago			1
they voted with their feet			0
it would be nice if you have n't left your heart behind			0
this country took you in during your hour of need			0
now in your moment of glory , which country deserves your respect -- the one that offered nothing to your parents and forced them to leave or the one that took you all in and gave you the opportunity to live out your dreams ? the answer should be obvious			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity247 .			0

@entity39 waved both @entity14 and @entity6 flags after winning in the @entity40
@entity247 : it was not a good idea for @entity39 to carry two flags
he says @entity39 should have been clear about which country he represented
@entity247 : by putting on the jersey for @entity223 , it 's clear what his choice was
