a year ago , a fisherman @entity0 came back from fishing trips with up to three and half tons of fish			1
in return he was able to buy 15 to 20 kilos of rice for his family every month and was planning to send at least one of his six children to college			2
he now returns with just 400 kilos of catch at best , meaning he can only afford one to two kilos of rice a month , while school for his children is an expensive luxury and out of the question			2
the reason ? he says he can longer fish in the fertile waters around @entity18			2
a cluster of uninhabitable sand banks and small rocks set in a shallow azure water lagoon about 130 miles ( 200 km ) west from the @entity24 island of @entity25 , @entity18 is one of a number of territories at the center of an international dispute in the @entity31			1
both the @entity24 and @entity32 lay claim to it			1
tense standoff the long - term tensions between the two nations escalated last april during a one - month stand off between the two nations , after @entity39 accused @entity32 boats of fishing illegally in the area			1
when a @entity24 navy vessel inspected the boats it found " large amounts of illegally collected corals , giant clams and live sharks " inside one of the boats , according to the @entity24 government			1
@entity39 then reported that two @entity32 surveillance ships had taken up position at the mouth of the lagoon , blocking the way to the fishing boats and " preventing the arrest " of the fishermen			1
the vessels stretched a cable across the mouth of the lagoon , which also prevented @entity24 fishermen from going there , according to the @entity24 coast guard			1
earlier this year , the @entity24 government took its feud with @entity32 to a @entity67 tribunal , a move that @entity69 has rejected			1
in an article on state - run @entity71 last month , @entity32 pointed to a code of conduct it signed in 2002 , known as the declaration on the @entity76 in the @entity31 , with fellow members of the @entity78 ( @entity78 )			1
it said the declaration expected that relevant disputes be solved through friendly talks and negotiations by sovereign states directly concerned			2
that brings little comfort to the struggling fishermen in communities in west @entity25 , the nearest region to @entity18 -- also known as @entity18 here or @entity18 to the @entity32			1
one of them is @entity90 , a municipality of 40,000 people , which relies on the seas for almost 80 % of its income , according to the @entity24 @entity96			1
it says thousands of fishermen have lost their regular jobs as catches decline			2
@entity101 is one of them			2
the 52 year old has been fishing in the waters off @entity90 for 22 years			2
he lives with his family in a traditional bamboo house mounted on pillars above the sea			2
his youngest daughter is four years old			0
@entity0 does not own a boat but used to be hired as a fisherman and paid a minimum of $ 85 dollars for a trip			0
he has tried to rent boats on his own and fish with his neighbors , but the little catch they bring back barely covers the rental fee and fuel			0
he says the @entity18 is the most important fishing ground in this region			1
" they ( the @entity32 ) shoo us away , will not allow @entity24 to come near the area , " he says			1
" they are the only ones that can fish there , not us			0
we lost @entity18 and it is hard			0
" @entity69 is unwavering in its claims			0
as recently as last month , the state - run @entity133 news agency reported that @entity32 surveillance vessels were carrying out regular missions in the @entity31			1
the @entity133 report cited @entity138 , director of the @entity139 , as saying that @entity32 would continue the patrols " to secure the nation 's maritime rights and interests " in areas it claims as its territorial waters			1
@entity32 's claim on the area dates back to 1279 during the @entity149 , when @entity32 astronomer @entity150 conducted a survey			1
then in 1935 , @entity32 declared sovereignty over 132 islands , reefs and shoals in the @entity31 , with the @entity18 -- or @entity156 -- included as a part of the @entity158 , according to @entity133			1
however , @entity101 is in little doubt who the lagoon , which lies within what the @entity24 declares as its @entity162 , belongs to			1
" of course it is ours			0
we own @entity18 , " he insists			0
" but @entity32 is trying to get it from us			1
our government should fix that			0
we should seek help from the @entity171 if the @entity24 government can not handle it alone			1
" nowhere else to go forones and his wife plan to stay in @entity90 , for now			0
he will try to start diving for shellfish			0
by selling clams , mussels and oysters , they can make around $ 5 a day			0
enough to buy rice and other basic food to feed the family			0
" there is no other place where we can go			0
i will stay here , get shells from nearby and help my husband to make living , " @entity173 ' wife , @entity188 , says			0
the situation is similar in @entity194 , a town 55 miles ( 88 km ) south of @entity90			1
it used to host one of the biggest @entity171 naval bases outside the @entity171 , before it closed in 1991			0
operators of the fishing market on the outskirts of the town of 90,000 say business is down 50 % since the fishermen were blocked from fishing where they wanted to at @entity18			1
many fishermen here share a similar story to their counterparts further north			2
" when we went there , a @entity32 vessel , the @entity211 blocked our path , " says @entity209 , 46 - year - old father of eight children			1
" as we managed to get past through it , it looked like they called another one because a different ship appeared and blocked our way again			0
" that 's when we got trapped			0
then a @entity32 man stepped out			1
he looked like their highest officer			0
he flashed a sign that we had to leave immediately			0
we were kicked out like pigs			0
" a number of fishermen have already left @entity194 and @entity90 and many more are considering it			2
one of them , 58 - year - old @entity231 , is @entity0 's cousin			2
he 's been a fisherman for 30 years but now makes a living as a motorbike taxi driver			0
he makes around $ 2 on a good day			0
" our income was higher when we used to fish at @entity18			0
i even used to save money			0
but now we earn just enough for daily consumption and sometimes what we earn is not even enough to provide food			0
" dangerous waters he still does occasional fishing trips but against his wife 's wish			2
@entity245 wants to leave @entity90 and their low income is not the only reason : " who would not get worried when they are out there ? what if they get shot ? " she was referring to the presence of the @entity32 boats			1
what puzzles the fishermen here most is the speed the whole situation has changed			2
although the @entity24 and @entity32 governments have disputed each other 's claim to the lagoon for many years , they could fish at @entity18 alongside @entity32 fishermen up until a few months ago			1
" i do not know why they do n't like us or why they do not want us within that area			0
if @entity171 were still in the region , the @entity32 would have never came to @entity18 because they would be scared			1
if our government allows the @entity171 to come back over here , its ok with me , " she says , referring to @entity275 's commitment to its mutual defense treaty with the @entity24 that former secretary of state @entity277 reaffirmed last year			1
but the solution to the dispute is as distant as ever			0
litigation at the @entity67 could last years			0
most of the local fishermen do not have so much time			2
so while the governments squabble , many of these fishermen and their families will have to leave the only life they have known and start from scratch somewhere else .			2
