-- step lively @entity2 , there 's a mystery afoot at the @entity4 -- and the estate of @entity7 ' creator says only the nine justices can ultimately solve the case of the @entity10			1
the estate of the late @entity13 author sir @entity12 has asked the high court to block a @entity16 writer from moving ahead with plans to publish a new series of stories featuring the celebrated fictional detective and his friend @entity2			1
a federal appeals court in @entity23 last month ruled in favor of @entity16 - based editor and lawyer @entity26 , saying he did not have to pay royalty fees to the @entity12 estate , over his plans to publish a new volume of @entity7 stories penned by contemporary authors			1
the estate then asked the high court to delay enforcement of the appeals court ruling , at least temporarily , until its legal team could prepare a more detailed petition for the justices to hear their case			2
there was no indication when the court would rule			0
the nine - member bench is on a three - month recess , but is available to handle these time - sensitive matters			0
@entity12 created one of the most famous and enduring characters in fiction , with four novels and 56 short stories published from 1887 to 1927			1
the final 10 stories remain under copyright protection in the @entity56 until 2022 , while the rest are in the public domain			1
in their high court claim , the estate asserts @entity7 " were not static but are dynamic literary characters who changed and developed throughout the @entity7 canon			1
" their lawyers say that means the adventures of the fictional friends from decades ago can not be appropriated today , based on older @entity12 works that are in the public domain			1
" many aspects of these characters ' natures are not revealed until the final 10 stories , which are still under copyright protection " say the estate 's lawyers			2
" the 10 stories are not set exclusively in the characters ' old age but at various points throughout the characters ' lives			2
" the financial stakes remain lucrative			0
the estate says the @entity7 character has been portrayed in more than 200 films , and that it has a financial and creative interest in ensuring the detective " is not despoiled in a way that would irreparably damage the value of the @entity7 copyright			1
" @entity26 had earlier paid a $ 5,000 licensing fee to the estate in 2011 for an initial work of re-imagined @entity7 stories called " a study in @entity99			1
" but he refused to pay a fee for a planned november sequel , " in the @entity102			0
" @entity26 's publisher , @entity104 , is supporting him in court			0
@entity26 's website describes him as " one of the world 's foremost authorities on @entity7 and @entity110			2
" in his blog , he dismisses the appeal to the @entity4			0
" the @entity113 [ federal appeals court ] ruled on june 22 in our favor , finding that creators were free to use the characters of @entity7 , @entity2 , etc. , so long as the creators did not infringe on the ' protected elements ' in the remaining 10 copyrighted stories , " said @entity26			2
" clearly , the characters ' names and most of their characteristics are not such ' protected elements			0
' thus , to put it very loosely , @entity7 is ' free			0
' " the case is @entity128 v. @entity26 ( 14a47 )			0
' @entity129 ' novelist sues over trademark			0

@entity7 was fictional , but he lives on in novels and short stories
