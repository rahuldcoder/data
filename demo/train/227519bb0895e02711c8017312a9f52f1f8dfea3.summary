-- the past year saw a mild winter give way to a balmier - than - normal spring , followed by a sweltering summer and high temperatures that lingered into the fall , all punctuated by extreme drought and intense storms			1
now 2012 is officially in the books as the hottest year on record for the continental @entity9 and the second - worst for " extreme " weather such as hurricanes , droughts or floods , the @entity9 government announced tuesday			1
the year 's average temperature of 55.3 degrees fahrenheit across the @entity18 was more than 3.2 degrees warmer than the average for the 20th century , the @entity16 reported			1
that topped the previous record , set in 1998 , by a full degree			2
every state in the contiguous @entity9 saw above - average temperatures in 2012 , with 19 of them setting annual records of their own , @entity16 said			1
meanwhile , the country faced 11 weather disasters that topped $ 1 billion in losses each , including a lingering drought that covered 61 % of the country at one point			2
that drought shriveled crops across the @entity9 farm belt , leading to an expected rise in food prices in 2013 , according to the @entity9 @entity39			0
it also turned forests of the @entity42 into stands of tinder that exploded into catastrophic wildfires over the summer , scorching millions of acres and destroying hundreds of homes			0
climate change , extreme weather linked and then there was @entity51 , a late october post-tropical cyclone that killed more than 110 people in the @entity9 and nearly 70 more in the @entity54 and @entity55			1

the year also saw @entity68 sea ice hit a record low in more than 30 years of satellite observations and studies that found the world 's major ice sheets have been shrinking at an increasing rate			2
scientists are quick to point out that no single storm can be blamed on climate change , but say a warming world raises the odds of extreme weather			2
" i think unfortunately , 2012 really may well be the new normal , " said @entity80 , director of the climate and clean air program at the @entity83 , a @entity9 environmental group			0
" it 's the kind of year we expect , given the global warming trend is ongoing			0
" the science of global warming is politically controversial but generally accepted as fact by most researchers , who point to heat - trapping carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels as the major cause			0
@entity80 's group is trying to press the @entity97 administration to tighten limits on carbon emissions , but he said those steps " are not going to reduce the threat of extreme weather overnight			1
" " we need to take greater preparations , anticipating the kind of storms and droughts that we saw are going to continue to be more frequent as we go forward , " he said			0

@entity118 was slightly cooler and wetter than normal , while nearly two - thirds of @entity119 's island chain faced moderate to exceptional drought conditions by december , @entity16 said			1
