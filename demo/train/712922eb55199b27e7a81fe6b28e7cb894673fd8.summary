@entity1 , @entity0 -- the days are getting shorter , the nights colder , but that does n't mean that your electricity bill needs to go through the roof			0
in a unique experiment , the residents of @entity10 's @entity9 are hoping to show that reducing your electricity consumption does n't have to be difficult			1
the @entity9 is switching off power to promote energy efficiency			2
as part of @entity19 , homes , schools and businesses on the @entity9 are switching off all non-essential electrical equipment to promote energy saving			1
the results of the experiment are being posted online in real - time			2
@entity19 organizer , @entity24 said : " the @entity9 are like a miner 's canary for the rest of the @entity10 , because of their vulnerability to sea level rise , to violent storms rolling off the @entity31 and to any major changes in the @entity33			1
" the islands , which lie 28 miles off @entity35 , the @entity10 's most westerly point , are connected to the @entity10 mainland by a single electricity cable which means that power usage in the experiment can be measured efficiently			1
all of the 2000 - strong community who are spread across five islands have been encouraged to join in			1
the energy savings made will be compared against the previous day 's usage with updates appearing online regularly			2
the @entity19 web site keeps track of costs and kwh usage providing up - to - the - minute information about how much electricity is being used in island - wide as well as individually monitoring @entity54 on @entity55 and the electricity consumption of one family			1
" we 've fitted the family and the school with special energy monitors so they can accurately monitor what appliances use the most electricity , " @entity24 told @entity2			2
studies suggest that families who use these sorts of energy monitors can cut their electricity bills by up to 20 percent			0
at the time of writing , the family 's consumption had dropped dramatically , down 35 percent on the previous day , which @entity74 estimates is a saving of around Â£ 300 ( $ 475 ) on their annual electricity bill			1
sadly the figures for the school and the island as a whole were n't quite so impressive			0
the school was up six percent on the previous day , while the island as a whole saw a two percent rise in usage			0
@entity24 put these small rises down to the notoriously fickle @entity10 weather			0
" yesterday was lovely and sunny , " he said			0
" so far , today it has been rainy			0
" the damp and gloom have meant more lights being switched on but despite these meteorological setbacks , @entity24 remained upbeat about the success of the experiment			0
" before the family left home this morning they turned off everything they could , so their reduction in usage is a fantastic result , " he said			0
visitors to the the @entity19 web site can also play the " 5 things " game to find out what all sorts of household appliances cost to run and how much they cost you and the environment			1
" the @entity19 experiment will hopefully prove that the small things can make a big difference , especially when we work together and try to save energy , " @entity24 said			2
@entity24 is also the founder of " @entity117 " -- an energy efficiency campaign which is helping phase out the use of incandescent light bulbs in 30 countries			0
the event has been organized as part of a four - day @entity126 event which has seen the @entity9 play host to fellow islanders from @entity129 , the @entity130 , @entity131 and the @entity132 -- whose inhabitants are some of the first people being displaced by rising sea - levels .			1

@entity10 's @entity9 take part in a day - long experiment monitoring electricity consumption
@entity141 being encouraged to switch off all non-essential electrical appliances
@entity19 is the *culmination* of a four - day long @entity126 on the islands
