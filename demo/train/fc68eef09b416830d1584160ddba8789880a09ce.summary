-- veteran coach @entity1 has been given the chance to restore @entity4 's fortunes following the short , unsuccessful tenure of @entity6 at the @entity8 club			1
@entity1 has previously been in charge of big @entity11 teams such as @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 , but has been out of work since leaving @entity4 's @entity19 rivals @entity18 in february after a run of poor results			1
he takes over a team in turmoil , with @entity6 sacked on wednesday following a 3 - 1 defeat by newly - promoted @entity25 -- @entity4 's second in three league matches			1
@entity6 , 53 , is the only coach in @entity4 's history to leave without winning a game			1
the three - time @entity11 champions also lost to archrivals @entity31 in the @entity32 and to @entity34 outfit @entity33 in the @entity36 group stage opener			0
" @entity1 has officially become the new coach of @entity4			1
he has signed a contract binding him to the club june 30 , 2013 , " @entity4 's official website reported on thursday			1
" everyone at @entity4 has the pleasure of welcoming @entity1 and his staff and wishing them well			1
" @entity1 , whose only major managerial honors are the @entity46 with @entity47 and 1999 @entity48 at @entity14 , said he wants to improve the current squad 's mentality			2
" i think i will need to talk a lot with the squad , the mental aspect is very important , " the 59 - year - old told @entity8 television channel @entity54			0
" @entity4 are a great team			2
we have to pick up the pace after this false start			0
the players are there and we have everything to lift the team			0
@entity6 had every right to try to execute his ideas ; he tried to make his system work with all his strength , but without success			2
" i do not think he can be criticized , he tried to implement his ideas until the end			0
for me , every system can bring victories -- if @entity4 have always played in a specific way , there must be a reason			2
" known as the " @entity73 " from his time at @entity13 when he constantly rotated his team , @entity1 refused to make any promises of success this season as @entity4 seek a 19th @entity19 crown			1
" i do not like to promise things			0
i want the best from these players , who have so much to give			0
" his appointment means that @entity4 have now had four different coaches since current @entity86 boss @entity85 left the @entity87 in may 2010			2
@entity85 guided @entity4 to a historic treble , which included a first @entity36 in 35 years , before being replaced by the @entity90 @entity89 after leaving for the @entity92 stadium			2
@entity89 , who led @entity93 to @entity36 success in 2005 , was sacked in december 2010 despite taking @entity4 to victory at the @entity96			0
former @entity31 coach @entity97 took over from @entity89 and guided @entity4 to a second - place finish in @entity19 last season , before his move to @entity102 's @entity101 as director of football led to @entity104 boss @entity6 being appointed in june			1
@entity1 's first match in charge of his new team will be saturday 's league trip to @entity109			0
meanwhile , the one @entity19 match played on thursday saw @entity18 and @entity111 draw 1 - 1 at the @entity112			1
@entity113 put @entity18 ahead in the 25th minute when he tapped home @entity114 's pull back			0
but the visitors levelled with just two minutes remaining when @entity118 netted from a rebound after @entity121 's effort crashed against the post			0
the result means both sides are still waiting for their first victory of the season , having drawn two of their opening three games			0
in @entity132 , an injury time goal from @entity131 gave @entity133 a 1 - 0 success over @entity135 , who have now lost threee successive @entity138 matches .			1

@entity4 have appointed @entity1 as their new coach
@entity1 arrives just *24* hours after @entity6 exited the club
@entity4 have made a *winless* start to the @entity19 season
@entity18 and @entity111 are still without a win after drawing 1 - 1 on thursday
