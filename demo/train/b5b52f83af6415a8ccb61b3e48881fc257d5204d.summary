-- i lost a friend and mentor today			1
@entity4 was the voice of three generations			1
her poetry spanned our journey , chronicled our hearts and documented our struggles as we moved from the orations of @entity13 to the presidency of @entity15			1
" dr. " @entity4 was a phenomenal woman			1
a rousing spirit , a joyful soul			1
a remarkable and gifted writer , a trailblazer , an activist , a mother			1
she was a woman who cooked up greens that could move you to dance			1
and yes , she danced , she loved to move			1
and she moved us all			2
she loved her black skin and her hair			2
growing up in the @entity31 , i learned to love my own skin and hair just as she taught us to			2
but @entity4 was not stuck on color or gender or religion or sexual orientation			1
she was fixated on humanity and helping to bring love and kindness into this world			2
that 's perhaps what i cherish about her the most : like every great artist , she emerged from deep and sorrowful struggle to reveal a beautiful , confident , calm and wise soul			1
she used that struggle to transform herself and made us believe that we , too , could transform ourselves as well			2
like the incredible tall oak trees of her beloved @entity49 , she was rooted in culture , grounded in the goodness of this earth and her amazing gift of poetry			2
she had a talent for weaving words into songs and songs into melodies			2
she was n't afraid to sway her hips			2
and she inspired us to do the same			2
opinion : how @entity4 gave me life @entity4 , we did n't tire of you			1
i can still hear those words she spoke on that chilly day , at the first inauguration of her fellow @entity49 , @entity68			1
her poem , " @entity74 , " is too long for me to quote in its entirety here , but i urge you , for your own sake , go read it			2
here are a few of its lines : the @entity78 cries out today , you may stand on me , but do not hide your face			0
across the wall of the world , @entity80 sings a beautiful song			0
it says , come rest here by my side			0
... come , clad in peace and i will sing the songs the creator gave to me when i and the tree and the rock were one			0
@entity4 also had a playful side			1
like any good friend , she enjoyed the company of people			0
once , my friend @entity97 hosted a luncheon in honor of @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity4			1
it was a moment for us , the up - and - coming , to meet our heroes , to sit at their feet and learn from them			0
before we could break bread ( cornbread ) , @entity4 had everyone laughing			1
she was a gifted storyteller and her warmth filled up many empty hearts			0
she made a place for so many folks in her life , in her kitchen or on her stage			0
@entity4 was born wise and when she talked , you could hear the ancient wisdom of our ancestors			1
she carried that warrior spirit from @entity122			0
@entity4 remembered by those she inspired i grew up with her poems and stories			1
they inspired me , they encouraged me , they taught me			0
i still have the paperback copies of her books i bought when i was a girl			0
i often wondered when i read one of her poems or stories for the first time , how does she know me ? how does she understand so well who i am , what i 'm going through , what questions and doubts , and triumphs and joys , i experience ? but that , of course , is what a great poet does			0
she speaks for herself , but she speaks for us all			0
and the amazing thing about @entity4 was that , although she was a black woman , her poems touched the souls of all @entity149			1
for instance , what immigrant or child of immigrants , what @entity154 survivor or child of a survivor , what adolescent or mother of an adolescent does not recognize his or her own history in the justly famous , " @entity163 " ? @entity4 : some of her most powerful speeches let her rest now			1
rest with @entity167 and @entity168 , with @entity102 and @entity13 and @entity169 , with @entity170 and @entity171			0
let her dance with @entity172 , @entity173 , and rejoice with @entity174			0
most of all , let her smile and be at peace with @entity177			0
i will honor her today by rereading some of her poems and stories			0
i urge you to do the same			0
she gave us the gift of her words and we should treasure them			0
she was phenomenal , someone i loved and will forever cherish			0
so , thank you @entity4			1
join us on @entity188 / @entity187 .			0
