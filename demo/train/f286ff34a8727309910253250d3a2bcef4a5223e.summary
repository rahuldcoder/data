@entity0 -- a fourth person was arrested in in the case of four mentally disabled people who were found locked in the boiler room of a @entity0 apartment building over the weekend , police said wednesday			1
the daughter of @entity9 , 51 , who previously was arrested in the case , was brought in for questioning tuesday night and was arrested early wednesday , said @entity0 police spokesman officer @entity11			1
the woman , whose name was not given , likely will face the same charges as her mother and two other suspects , which include criminal conspiracy , aggravated assault , kidnapping , criminal trespass , unlawful restraint and false imprisonment , @entity11 said			1
more information will be released later wednesday , she said			2
no bail had been set			2
on tuesday , @entity0 police commissioner @entity27 said a woman rescued from the boiler room claims she had two children while being held against her will , and that authorities have located 10 other potential victims			1
the four people , three men and a woman ranging in age from 29 to 41 , were found locked in the room with no food and only a bucket for a toilet , police said			1
the pitch - black , 15 - foot - by - 6 - foot space houses what police described as a boiler used to heat the building			1
a penetrating stench of urine and feces still hung in the chamber days after the discovery			2
one of the four , identified as @entity52 , had been chained to the boiler , police said			1
while police have not released the names of the four alleged victims , they confirmed the accuracy of media reports identifying them as @entity52 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60			1
@entity61 ; @entity62 , 47 ; and @entity63 , 49 , were previously arrested			1
authorities were investigating whether the victims ' @entity66 checks had been stolen , as well as several other leads			1
six of the 10 new alleged victims are children , @entity27 said			1
two of them , ages 2 and 5 , are believed to be the children born to @entity60 , police said			1
authorities did not divulge how @entity60 became pregnant			2
another is a 19 - year - old niece of @entity79 , @entity27 said			0
" the 19 - year - old has visible injuries , she may have been beaten , and she has scars all over her body , " @entity27 said			0
@entity60 said while she was with @entity61 , " she says she gave birth to two children and we have no reason to doubt it , " he said			1
@entity61 had identification documents for about 50 people with her when she was arrested , @entity27 said			1
they included @entity66 cards and court documents giving power of attorney , among others			0
@entity27 said police must track down all of those individuals and find out what happened to them and whether they were victims			1
it is possible that @entity61 has been involved in similar activity dating back to the late 1990s , he said			0
" we do n't know the extent of this , " @entity27 told @entity1 tuesday			0
" we do know it goes beyond the borders of @entity113 -- at least @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 , and we suspect other locations as well			1
" three of the four alleged victims spoke to the media about their harrowing experience on monday			1
" that was real dirty of you			0
that was wrong , " a tearful @entity52 told @entity1 affiliate @entity121 , talking about his alleged captors			1
the alleged victims said they were beaten and were afraid of the suspects in the case			1
@entity60 told @entity61 hit her in the head , " and all this was bleeding and everything			0
" @entity52 , @entity60 and a third man , @entity58 , told @entity121 their @entity66 information was taken from them			0
@entity52 , who said he is from @entity132 , said he met @entity61 on an online dating site , according to @entity121			0
he said once he attempted to escape from a home of @entity61 's , " and i did n't get away , so they got me			0
" bond for each of the three suspects was set at $ 2.5 million , according to the @entity0 district attorney 's office			0
the @entity143 joined the probe after detectives discovered one of the accused had traveled to at least two other states with the people found in the basement of the northeast @entity0 apartment building , police spokesman @entity141 said			2
@entity61 served eight years in prison for killing her sister 's boyfriend in the early 1980s , @entity27 said earlier			0
in that case , the victim " was held captive for an extended period of time , locked in a closet and he literally starved to death , " he said			2
" that concerns us because obviously , she 's capable of quite a bit of a lot of different things , " he said			0
asked why @entity61 is not still behind bars , @entity27 said tuesday , " that 's a good question			0
our legal system is what it is , but you would think that someone who 's committed a crime that horrific would still be in jail			0
but she was n't , and obviously she was n't fully rehabilitated , either			0
" @entity27 said he has a team of detectives working the case , and is likely to put a task force together for long - term investigation , because " this is not one that 's going to end very quickly			2
" @entity61 is believed to have been in @entity184 , @entity109 , with some or all of the alleged captives			2
they then traveled to @entity110 and @entity0 , @entity141 said			0
all seven had been traveling together , he said , but he did not know for how long			0
a preliminary hearing for the suspects on the charges and evidence in the @entity0 case was set for october 24			2
no pleas were entered on monday , with that to happen at a formal arraignment at a date yet to be set			0
@entity1 's @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 contributed to this report .			0
