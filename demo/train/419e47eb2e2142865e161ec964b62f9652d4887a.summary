" birdman " will go into the history books as 2014 's best picture winner , but the 87th @entity4 will also be remembered for a handful of stirring moments -- and a few awkward ones : @entity9 and @entity11 's song " glory , " written for the film " @entity13 , " had the @entity4 crowd visibly moved with its rousing message , accompanied by a full gospel chorus			1
@entity19 , who played @entity20 in the film , had tears running down his face			1
after winning the @entity4 , both @entity9 and legend used their speeches for some eloquent points			1
" this bridge was once a landmark of a divided nation , but now is a symbol for change			1
the spirit of this bridge transcends race , gender , religion , sexual orientation , and social status			1
... this bridge was built on hope , " said @entity9			1
complete winners list but legend added a note of warning			1
" we wrote this song for a film that was based on events that were 50 years ago , but we say @entity13 is now , because the struggle for justice is right now , " he said , invoking threats to the @entity46 and the level of correctional control of @entity50 men			1
@entity57 won best supporting actress for playing an independent - minded mother in " boyhood			1
" she stood up for her character -- and all women -- in her acceptance speech			1
" to every woman who gave birth , to every taxpayer and citizen of this nation , we have fought for everybody else 's equal rights , it 's our time to have wage equality once and for all , and equal rights for women in the @entity75 , " she said			1
@entity76 was so struck she stood up , pointing in solidarity			2
@entity78 often hides her musical talent behind attention - getting outfits , including a meat dress and -- at tonight 's @entity4 -- some dishwashing - like red gloves			1
but the @entity83 have shown she 's a heck of a pianist , and at the @entity4 she let her voice roar on a medley from " @entity88			2
" @entity89 herself was awed by @entity78 's performance , applauding and thanking her			1
an excited @entity91 , who won best adapted screenplay for " @entity93 , " started his speech almost beside himself with joy			2
but after a breath , he turned somber			2
" when i was 16 years old , i tried to kill myself , " he said			2
" because i felt weird , and i felt different , and i felt like i did not belong			2
and now i 'm standing here , and i would like for this moment to be for that kid out there who feels like she 's weird or she 's different or does n't fit anywhere			2
" early in the evening , the @entity4 for best documentary short went to " crisis hotline : veterans press 1 , " a film about the struggles of returning veterans			2
as part of her acceptance speech , @entity112 , one of the producers , dedicated her @entity4 to her son			0
he suffered from bipolar disorder and committed suicide in 2005			0
" we should talk about suicide out loud , " she said			0
resources for suicide awareness and prevention include the @entity123 and the @entity124			0
@entity125 mostly acquitted himself -- jokes about " the best and the whitest " and a skit based on " birdman " went over well -- but he had a couple awkward moments			1
the most notable came after the win for " @entity131 , " a documentary about @entity135 contractor @entity133			0
after director @entity136 gave a speech warning about invasion of privacy , @entity125 tried to lighten the mood			0
@entity133 could n't be here tonight " for some treason , " @entity125 said			0
that got him in trouble online			0
he was n't the only one			0
@entity145 took a while to get through his introduction of three best picture nominees , prompting some wags to wonder if he was practicing for a future episode of " @entity151			0
" @entity152 received complaints for a crack about " birdman " director @entity155 , a @entity157 : " who gave this son of a bitch his green card ? " and then there was the luckless @entity163 , who shared a microphone with @entity165			0
last year , @entity163 was immortalized for calling @entity165 " @entity165			0
" this year , he got her name right but also got a little handsy with the singer			0
social media had a field day			0
your move , @entity173 .			0
