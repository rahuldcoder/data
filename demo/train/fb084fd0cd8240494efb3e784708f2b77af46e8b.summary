fifty - three percent of people questioned in the poll said the @entity8 's polices would move the nation in the wrong direction , with 42 percent saying @entity8 policies are good for the country			1
" the numbers for both parties are virtually unchanged since late august , just before president @entity29 's health care speech to @entity30 opened the latest round of debate on this divisive issue , " said @entity25 , @entity1 's polling director			1
@entity2 will be defending their large majorities in @entity30 next year when all 435 @entity36 seats and more than a third of the @entity39 seats are up for grabs			2
