-- an unapologetic @entity1 insisted sunday that he is " the least racist " when pressed as to whether racism motivated his recent focus on president @entity5 's birth certificate and academic qualifications			1
the millionaire - turned - television host spoke with @entity0 's @entity8 about the @entity9 and whether a presidential bid was in the offing , before the conversation turned to matters of race and comments made earlier in the day by @entity17 ' " @entity18 " host @entity16			1
@entity16 's comments were in response to @entity1 's public questions about @entity5 's academic degree			1
" the word is , he was n't a good student and he ended up getting into @entity26 and @entity27 , " @entity1 said recently			2
" i 'd like to know : how does he get into @entity27 , how does he get into @entity26 if he is n't a good student ? " referencing those comments , @entity16 said on his sunday program , " that 's just code for saying ' he got into law school because he 's black			2
' this is an ugly strain of racism that 's running through this whole thing			2
" @entity16 's statement referenced an internet meme that has grown rapidly in recent weeks , fueled by comments from public personalities , like " @entity43 's " @entity44 and @entity45 , other media personalities and academics			0
" racism by inference " is how @entity49 professor @entity48 , also on " @entity18 , " described it			1
" skepticism about black intelligence and suspicion about black humanity have gone hand in hand throughout the history of this country in feeding the perception that black people do n't quite measure up , " he said			0
" he is standing in for the rest of us as african - americans , " @entity48 added			0
" we are constantly questioned as to our legitimacy - whether we belong or not			2
" but when @entity8 questioned @entity1 sunday night about race stereotypes , he insisted , " i am a wonderful person as far as you would be concerned as to race			1
and i think everybody that knows me knows that			0
" @entity1 said repeatedly that people who know him " would laugh " at the suggestion that he is racist			1
@entity8 also asked @entity1 about his recent use of the term " the blacks " to refer to black people			1
but @entity1 said the issue was a diversion			0
" i have many , many black friends who said to me , ' absolutely not a problem			0
' ... the fact is , i wan na focus on jobs , the economy ... that nations are laughing at us and taking our money and taking our jobs and ripping us off			0
" but anti-racism activist @entity90 said @entity1 's tactic is the latest move in an old game			1
" this is part of a long - standing , white conservative narrative that people of color are getting things they do n't deserve because of affirmative action or racial handouts , " @entity90 told @entity8 after @entity1 's interview			1
" so either @entity1 is either the most uninformed individual in the western world because he does n't know how his comments fit that narrative ; or he knows full well what he 's doing and he is deliberately pushing these buttons of racial resentment			1
" @entity108 , of @entity109 and @entity110 , was more sympathetic to @entity1			0
" when a white man with privilege questions a black man 's intelligence it sounds very racist and sounds very stereotypical , " @entity108 said			2
" he probably is a wonderful man			0
he 's a very smart man			0
but it 's a prime example of how a wonderful , smart man could make a mistake			0
