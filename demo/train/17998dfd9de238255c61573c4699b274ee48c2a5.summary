scientists are concerned about what they 're seeing so far this flu season , the director of the @entity1 said thursday , a day after the agency advised doctors this year 's flu vaccine is not as effective because the current strain of the virus has mutated			1
dr. @entity10 said researchers are worried that with this particular strain of the virus , " we could have a season that is more severe than most with more hospitalizations and more deaths			2
" the advisory sent wednesday said 52 % of the 85 influenza virus samples collected and analyzed from october 1 through november 22 were different than the virus strains included in this year 's vaccine , indicating a mutation , or drift , of the strain			2
the most common strain of the virus reported so far this season is influenza a ( @entity28 )			2
in the past , this strain has been linked to higher rates of hospitalization and death , especially for those at high risk for complications , which is usually the very young , the elderly and those with chronic health conditions such as asthma or heart problems			0
in february , a panel of experts decided on 3 strains of the virus to include in this year 's vaccine , based on data about the common strains circulating around the globe throughout the year			2
some years the vaccine is a better match to the circulating strains than others			0
it 's too late to create another version of the flu vaccine this year , @entity10 said , because even with modern production technology , it typically takes about four months to produce the vaccine			0
while this year 's version is not as protective against a mutated strain , it can still decrease the severity of illness caused by the virus			1
it can also protect against other circulating strains of the virus , which is why the @entity1 still recommends getting the vaccine			1
" the flu is bad , and you want to do anything you can to prevent getting it and to prevent giving it to other people , " said dr. @entity69 , a pediatrician in @entity70			1
" the vaccine is n't perfect , but it 's the best protection we have for prevention			0
" when asked if people should be concerned , @entity69 said " people should always be concerned about the flu			1
" in a news conference thursday , @entity10 emphasized that if you do start to see flu symptoms -- fever , sore throat , cough , body aches -- it 's extremely important to begin taking antiviral medications as soon as possible			0
@entity91 and @entity92 have been considered most effective at reducing complications when given soon after symptoms begin			0
however , he said , most doctors still do not treat people with the antiviral medications , noting that fewer than 1 in 6 people who are severely ill with flu get them			1
" it is very important that we do better , " @entity10 said			0
antiviral medications can reduce symptoms , shorten the length of time of the illness , and may keep people out of the hospital			0
so far this year , five children in the @entity111 have died from the flu , @entity10 said			0
in past years , studies have shown 98 % of children who do die from flu have not been vaccinated , but it was not clear if the five children @entity10 cited were vaccinated			1
during the 2012 - 2013 flu season 12,337 people were hospitalized with flu - related illness and 149 children died , according to @entity1 surveillance data			1
ninety percent of those children were not vaccinated			0
overall , flu activity across the country is currently low , according to the latest flu outbreak data from the @entity1 .			1

@entity1 says mutated flu virus means current flu shot is less protective
still , the @entity1 recommends people get vaccinated against the flu
flu activity across the country is currently low , @entity1 says
