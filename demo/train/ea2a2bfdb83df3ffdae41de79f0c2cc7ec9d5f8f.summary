@entity0 -- after eight days of bone - shattering bombardment , @entity0 was calm thursday and friday as residents of this battered land sought to return to their daily lives			1
@entity8 of @entity0 , the @entity7 family was preparing to move to a rented house until they can repair their home 's roof , which was blown off			1
in the meantime , they said , they were hoping the peace would hold			0
" @entity19 willing , it will last 100 years , 200 years , for the sake of our children , " said @entity17			0
in @entity0 , thousands of people took part in a celebration that was not so much of a military victory as a psychological one			1
who won , who lost for impoverished @entity0 , whose 1.7 million residents were massively outgunned by @entity33 's military , to survive was to triumph			1
" i think people feel now that the only way to push @entity33 to give concessions is resistance , " said @entity34 , a senior @entity35 official , who cited @entity33 's agreement to wednesday 's cease - fire as vindication of @entity35 ' struggle			1
" because president @entity44 spent about 20 years in negotiations , but they got nothing from this , " he added , referring to @entity44 , leader of the rival @entity47 @entity46 group , which governs the occupied @entity49 and is considered more moderate than @entity35			0
this new reality may embolden @entity35 to push for even more			0
after the cease - fire ended the flareup between the @entity47 of @entity0 and the @entity57 , @entity35 can claim credit for extracting important concessions from @entity33 , including its promise to loosen @entity0 's isolation from the outside world			1
@entity35 has also shown that its rockets have improved and that it is not as vulnerable to @entity33 airstrikes as it was during the " @entity67 " @entity66 four years ago , when more than 1,400 @entity47 were killed			1
its international stature grew as it gained popular and official @entity70 support			0
palestinians left with a paradox @entity33 's military also claimed success , saying on wednesday that it had destroyed " significant elements " of @entity35 ' rocket - launching capabilities			1
and its " @entity78 " missile - defense system proved able to intercept numerous attacks from the south			0
@entity81 , who is looking forward to elections in january , also showed himself to be an effective military leader			0
polls say the vast majority of @entity33 supported the operation			1
@entity47 leaders sought to cast the cease - fire as a catalyst toward uniting their divided factions , while @entity33 said they were happy for quiet after the shelling and counterstrikes			1
in @entity0 , supporters of @entity35 and @entity46 gathered near the @entity94 in a rare display of unity that included yellow @entity46 flags and green @entity35 banners flapping in the breeze alongside @entity47 flags			1
the mood was celebratory and militant			0
the leader of @entity104 , a party to the truce that was brokered by @entity106 and that took effect on wednesday night , called for more weapons to maintain resistance against @entity33			2
" we should be ready through our unity , through our resistance , to keep the perseverance and steadfastness of our people , " @entity111 said			0
@entity35 prime minister @entity118 declared in a televised speech that @entity33 had " raised the white flag			2
" he described the fighting as " preparation to liberate @entity123 " and the @entity124 located on the @entity125			0
@entity118 , who heads the governing party of @entity0 , said the cease - fire showed the @entity128 had been forced to soften its stance in the region in the wake of the @entity132			1
" the victory of @entity0 is a solid truth , not a phenomenon , " @entity118 said			2
" the era of @entity106 and the region has changed , and @entity128 has now begun learning to listen to a new language			0
" analysis : conflict shifts balance of power in the @entity142 the violence left more than 160 @entity47 dead , many more injured and thousands homeless			0
at least six @entity33 were killed , including a soldier who died thursday of wounds suffered wednesday just before the cease - fire took hold , the @entity57 said			1
for the first time , @entity33 experienced rocket attacks from @entity0 on its main cities of @entity151 and @entity123			1
the truce negotiated by @entity106 president @entity153 followed a visit to the region by @entity128 secretary of state @entity156 and a series of phone calls from @entity128 president @entity159 to the main players			0
however , it was unclear if the latest events would lead to a resumption of long - stalled negotiations on a broader peace agreement or serve simply as a respite , as has occurred in the past			2
" new dynamics in the @entity142 potentially could make this time different , " the independent @entity168 said thursday in a report			0
the report said @entity153 's government had demonstrated pragmatism in negotiating the cease - fire and presented @entity33 and @entity35 with the opportunity to reset expectations because it had credibility among @entity179			1
" ultimately , as the dust settles and guns turn silent , much more will be known about the new regional map -- how it works , who sets the rules , how far different parties will go , whether the obstacles continually encountered in the past can be overcome , " the report said			0
but it minced no words about the victims			0
" this short war has been , as president @entity159 might put it , a teachable moment , " it said			0
" a pity the education came at such a high price			0
and that , once more , all the wrong people -- the civilians on both sides -- were asked to foot the bill			0
" over the eight days of conflict , @entity47 counted 163 dead and 1,225 wounded in the wake of 1,500 @entity33 strikes , @entity0 's @entity203 said			1
@entity35 ' military wing , the @entity209 brigade , said it fired 1,573 rockets toward @entity33 during the hostilities , including three shot toward @entity123			2
in addition to the six @entity33 fatalities , 200 others were wounded			2
a spokesman for @entity81 told @entity1 on thursday that @entity35 ' stance toward @entity33 harms the ability to negotiate			2
" you must remember , @entity35 , unfortunately , is the enemy of peace , " said the spokesman , @entity219			0
" @entity35 does n't want to negotiate			0
@entity35 says that any @entity47 who negotiates with @entity33 is a traitor to the @entity47 cause			2
" @entity70 - @entity128 watch conflict with mix of worry , relief at the same time , @entity219 said @entity33 has called on @entity47 leaders to restart peace talks and was hoping for a positive response soon			1
at the @entity0 rally , @entity47 negotiator @entity233 of @entity46 blamed @entity33 for the division of loyalties between the two groups			1
he called for unification to thwart " what the enemy is wanting to do " and passed on greetings from @entity44 , the president of the @entity243			0
" thank @entity19 , through you , we were able to push back this naked aggression that targeted @entity0 and its people , " @entity233 said , adding that " we should crown this victory by ending the division and expanding the national unity			2
" @entity106 's @entity153 praised for his key role in talks @entity106 politician @entity253 , president of the moderate @entity254 , also congratulated the crowd , saying , " you have broken the will of the @entity259 entity -- you have made them feel uncertain and insecure			0
" the agreement calls for both sides to move toward opening border crossings to facilitate the movement of people and goods			1
on thursday , some of the @entity33 soldiers who had been moved to @entity0 's border for a potential ground invasion packed their gear to leave			1
residents of @entity274 , within rocket range of @entity0 's border , expressed skepticism about whether the cease - fire would hold , noting that similar agreements have proved short - lived			1
some said they would have preferred that @entity33 's military stage a ground invasion to destroy the militants ' rocket capabilities			2
on the ground : follow updates from @entity1 's reporters under the cease - fire , talks were to begin thursday on easing economic restrictions on @entity0			1
since the cease - fire was declared , three rockets have been launched from @entity0 into @entity33 , the @entity57 said thursday			1
two of the three landed in open areas , and @entity33 's defense system intercepted the third			2
@entity33 officials ' earlier assertions citing five to 12 missiles were incorrect , the @entity57 said			2
opinion : will real change come from this cease - fire ? a senior @entity159 administration official said @entity153 had been " very constructive " and " very pragmatic " in his dealings with his @entity128 counterpart			1
he and @entity159 developed a " relationship of trust and were able to work through some of these issues , " the official said			0
the cease - fire calls for @entity33 to halt all acts of aggression on @entity0 , including incursions and the targeting of people , according to @entity106 's state news agency			1
it also calls for the @entity47 factions to cease all hostilities from @entity0 against @entity33 , including the firing of rockets and border attacks			1
gazans could see an easing of border restrictions			0
smuggling weapons to @entity0 -- the long way @entity219 said the agreement calls for " complete and total cessation of all hostile activity initiated in the @entity328			1
" " for us , that 's victory			0
that 's what we wanted , " he said			0
the fighting was ignited by the november 14 assassination by @entity33 of @entity336 , the head of @entity35 ' military wing			2
@entity33 said its intent was to end rocket attacks on southern @entity33 from inside @entity0 by degrading @entity47 capabilities			1
