-- @entity3 's @entity2 competitor may have been the worst - kept secret since balloon boy 's disastrous appearance on @entity7 last week			1
@entity3 has unveiled an e-reader called " nook , " which will sell for $ 260 in november			1
but the advance hype does n't seem to have hurt the launch of the @entity9 , an impressive - looking $ 260 device that will go head - to - head with @entity14 's @entity2 , currently the most successful product in a small but growing market for e-book readers			1
basic details of the @entity9 were published by the @entity19 on tuesday following leaked images that appeared on @entity21 last week			0
and @entity3 leaked product details hours before reporters filed into @entity24 in @entity25 for the announcement on tuesday afternoon			2
" simply following the leader is not in our dna , " said @entity3 president @entity27			2
indeed , @entity3 's $ 260 @entity9 device differs from the kindle in a number of ways			1
most notably , it shares : a feature called @entity38 lets users borrow certain books ( depending on the publisher 's wishes ) , the same way readers have traditionally traded paper books			1
the @entity9 's color touchscreen allows you to navigate titles and enter search terms using a virtual keyboard that goes dark once you 're reading			2
the @entity9 will be available for pre-order starting tuesday night for $ 260 at @entity50 , and will ship in november			1
it has a 6 - inch , " paper - like , " 16 - level grayscale display that supports up to five fonts and various font sizes			0
it can read a user 's pdfs , as well as the 1 million - plus books , magazines and newspapers available in @entity3 's ebook store			1
the device connects to the @entity61 using a free @entity63 connection , but lacks a web browser " because those are clumsy " on @entity66 , @entity27 says			0
it includes support for the @entity70 format , @entity71 and @entity72 , as well as @entity73 feeds from the internet			0
however , you ca n't subscribe to any old rss feed			0
instead , @entity3 selects certain feeds to convert to @entity70 , then sends them out each morning for a fee that varies by publisher			0
like @entity14 's @entity2 , @entity3 's nook lets you highlight and annotate content			1
but @entity9 's battery life is 10 days , while the @entity2 keeps you reading for 14 -- even though at 11.2 ounces the @entity9 weighs an ounce more			1
unlike the @entity2 , the @entity9 has a @entity84 that customers will be able to use at @entity3 's more than 700 physical locations and 600 college stores in 50 states			1
the current version does not allow connection to @entity92 networks outside the stores , but will allow nook owners to digitally flip through books while they 're in a @entity3 store and read free content			2
the @entity9 runs @entity98 , which @entity27 said " works really well for navigating on this small device			0
" however , at this point , third - party developers can not develop apps for the device , and no version of the reader for generic @entity98 devices is available			0
the device packs enough memory to hold up to 1,500 books ( 2 gb ) , with a microsd slot that lets you add up to 16 gb more			0
in addition to e-books in the three formats mentioned above , the device supports a user 's pictures and @entity118 ( it includes a speaker and headphone jack , but there 's no text - to - speech engine )			0
another nice touch : the virtual bookmark feature called @entity125 now lets you pick up where you left off on the @entity9 or on more than 100 other devices with support for @entity3 's ebook store			1
perhaps the biggest difference between the @entity9 and the @entity2 is cosmetic			0
the @entity9 , with color icons , a wide selection of designer cases and color - customizable back panel , looks like a fashionista compared to the more bookish @entity2			2
