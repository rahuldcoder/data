-- my dad still uses an old flip phone			1
and its two ringtone choices are an early recording of greensleeves or a dramatic poetry slam by @entity11			2
but it works for him			2
and that 's all that matters			2
besides , how proletarian could it possibly be when even the billionaire owner of the @entity18 , @entity17 , uses one ? the world sort of took notice of @entity17 ' phone last week at the @entity24 - @entity23 football game which was , for recruiting and financial reasons , being played at @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29			1
the venue is now known as @entity27			2
but you can call it the @entity33			2
because , at one point , @entity17 appeared on the game 's tv broadcast while talking on his flipper inside his luxury box			1
and that 's when the tweets started pouring out			2
@entity42 anchor , @entity41 , wrote : @entity17 is worth over a billion dollars , but my man still uses a flip phone ... # @entity46 and @entity47 , a sports writer for @entity48 , posted a screen grab from his tv			1
so , clearly , viewers were jarred by the sight of this very wealthy man using something many of us now look at as a museum piece			0
mind you , this would be in the world 's crappiest museum			0
" excuse me , ma'am			0
no taking pictures of the razr			0
" what 's interesting about this is that it 's not like @entity17 ca n't afford a smart phone			1
he just chooses not to have one			0
and you kind of have to respect that			0
but i still wonder why a man who , otherwise , seems so committed to technology has such an old - school mobile device			0
remember , his football stadium holds one of the world 's largest , most advanced high - def video boards -- it stretches 160 feet wide and 72 feet high			0
if the stadium roof were open and you were standing on the moon with nothing else to do , you could watch @entity18 games			1
after all of the outrage and amazement about his phone , @entity17 later went on the radio with @entity89 [ @entity89 ] and addressed the non-situation situation			1
" i do n't know what to say other than i can guarantee @entity91 is on the top of that flip phone , " he said			1
" it works for me			0
i do n't have any butt - dialing with that thing			1
" he 's got a point			0
it 's been so long since i 've actually owned a flip phone that i 've really forgotten what the experience even feels like			1
fortunately , though , i have n't had too many problems with butt - dialing			1
however , i 'd like to think mine would be rather pragmatic about his decisions to use the phone			1
" hey , it 's @entity109 's ass			0
can i swing by and borrow a cup of flour ? " he likes to cook			0
at this point , i do n't think i could ever go back			1
but there are definitely some strong arguments supporting the use of flip phones even though smartphone prices really are n't that bad these days			1
right now , for example , an @entity120 starts at $ 99			1
of course , you 'll have to live with the fact that people will think your phone was a victim of some sort of horrible paint explosion			1
but if you can get past the fact that its color can not be found anywhere on the natural spectrum , you 'll be good to go			0
that might be a legitimate argument for flip phones			1
they do tend to last longer by virtue of the fact that they 're not trying to power a million different apps , all of which are keeping you from performing your duties at work			0
hell , maybe that 's why @entity17 is so successful			1
he ca n't be bothered with all these distractions			2
whereas , at this very moment , the following apps are currently running in the background of my @entity120 : messages , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity157 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , and settings			0
currently running on @entity17 ' phone : phone			1
clearly , one of us is more distracted			0
and perhaps there 's a correlation between focus and wealth			0
@entity17 ' net worth : $ 3 billion			1
my net worth : a @entity187 and some pineapple chunks			1
so , there 's that			0
also , flip phones are arguably more durable			2
all the glass and major features are protected when you close them up			0
whereas , with a smart phone , everything on the planet is basically a ball - peen hammer			2
of course , water is the ultimate death blow to any phone			2
which is kind of sad			0
remember when pushing somebody in the pool was funny ? now it 's a $ 200 investment			2
anyway , i 'm sure there 's someone in your life who still uses a flip phone			1
so , share this with them and tell them it 's ok			0
one of the richest men in the world is on their team			0
follow @entity221 on @entity156 .			0
