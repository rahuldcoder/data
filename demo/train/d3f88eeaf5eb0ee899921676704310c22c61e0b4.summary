@entity0 -- @entity3 economics professor @entity2 apologized tuesday for his " glib , thoughtless and sometimes downright insulting comments " about @entity5 and the intelligence of @entity8 voters			1
@entity2 , who had tremendous influence in shaping the @entity5 , came under fire last month after newly unearthed videos showed him suggesting that @entity12 purposefully misled @entity8 while passing the president 's signature health care law			1
" i would like to begin by apologizing sincerely for the offending comments that i made , " he said in his testimony before the @entity16			1
" i sincerely apologize both for conjecturing with a tone of expertise and for doing so in such a disparaging fashion , " @entity2 added			1
" it is never appropriate to try to make oneself seem more important or smarter by demeaning others			0
i am embarrassed , and i am sorry			0
" years - old but newly surfaced video show @entity2 saying the legislation was drafted amd sold to the public in a way that masked the penalty for not getting health insurance , so that voters would n't consider it a tax			1
calling the plan a " clever " and " basic exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the @entity8 voter , " @entity2 hailed how the measure passed " because the @entity8 people are too stupid to understand the difference			2
" while @entity2 has previously described himself as an " architect " of @entity5 , he sharply denied the label on tuesday , arguing that his role in the legislation has been inflated in the past			1
still , he helped create the health care law in @entity47 under then gov. @entity48 , and went on to play a key role in crafting the idea behind the series of exchanges , subsidies and taxes that form the federal law 's centerpiece			0
both democrats and @entity58 hounded @entity2 during the hearing			1
@entity61 chairman @entity60 blasted his initial comments as an " insult " to voters , while ranking member @entity65 , the top @entity66 on the committee , slammed @entity2 's remarks as " absolutely stupid " and " irresponsible			2
" @entity65 added that he was " extremely frustrated " because it " gave @entity58 a public relations gift in their relentless political campaign to tear down the @entity5			2
" at one point , rep. @entity72 of @entity73 referenced her recently deceased husband to issue a sharp warning to @entity2			2
her husband , she said , was having chest pains , but due to confusion over whether the couple was covered by @entity5 , he did n't have all the tests the doctor recommended			0
he died from a heart attack in his sleep oct. 24			0
" the so - called glibness that has been referenced today have direct consequences for real @entity8 people , so get over your damn glibness , " @entity72 said			0
while he regretted his initial comments , @entity2 did not deny the substance of the arguments he was making about the legislation			0
he also drew ire from lawmakers when he confirmed that he was paid nearly $ 400,000 for his work on the health care law but said he could not recall how much he received for other federal and state contracts -- a sum estimated to be in the millions			0
@entity60 and @entity58 members of the committee threatened to subpoena @entity2 for that information			0
" it is very clear we 're going to have to do more discovery , " @entity60 said at the end of the hearing			0
while @entity2 conceded that he " behaved badly , " he defended the @entity5 as a significant law that benefits the public			1
" my own inexcusable arrogance is not a flaw in the @entity5			1
