-- a brazen , daylight suicide bombing on the @entity4 's peacekeeping mission in @entity6 's capital has killed at least 21 people , mostly peacekeepers , the mission said friday			1
the attack came days after @entity10 special forces killed @entity11 , pictured , in southern @entity6			1
suicide bombers , disguised in two @entity14 - marked vehicles , thursday rammed through the security gate of the mission 's headquarters , which is attached to @entity19 's airport			1
they detonated their explosives just as @entity6 's transitional government and mission representatives concluded a high - level meeting inside the compound , said the @entity4 's special representative for @entity6 , @entity25			2
the attack killed four @entity6 civilians and 17 @entity29 and @entity30 soldiers , including the mission 's second in command , @entity30 maj. gen. @entity34 , he said			1
the force commander , @entity29 maj. gen. @entity35 , was among the 40 wounded			0
he assumed command of the @entity37 -- known as @entity37 -- last month			0
the bombs struck a building that also housed the offices of @entity41 , a @entity10 military contractor that supports the peacekeeping operation , according to @entity25			2
it is unclear if any of @entity41 's employees were among those wounded in the strike , and a company representative could not be immediately reached for comment			0
after the bombings , insurgents fired mortars at the @entity4 compound in an effort to maximize the number of casualties , @entity25 said			2
@entity56 , the @entity57 militia with ties to @entity59 , claimed responsibility for the attack , according to the @entity4			1
the strike happened days after @entity10 special forces targeted and killed a senior @entity59 operative in southern @entity6			1
analysts immediately hailed the death of @entity11 on monday as a major blow to @entity59 's efforts to work with @entity56 to try to gain a foothold in the lawless country			1
days later , however , @entity56 struck back at the most prominent @entity72 - linked target in @entity19 -- the @entity4 peacekeeping mission			1
the @entity4 has a 3,400 - member peacekeeping force in @entity6 , made up of troops from @entity30 and @entity29			2
it operates under a @entity14 mandate to support @entity6 's transitional federal government			2

it is the de facto military force of the weak , transitional @entity6 government			0
thursday 's bombing was the deadliest attack on @entity4 peacekeepers in @entity19			1
it was also a show of force by @entity56 to the @entity90 , particularly after the death of @entity11 , who was considered the main link between @entity59 and @entity56			1
@entity25 said he hoped it would " galvanize the international community ... to do more and do better " in helping restore order to @entity6			0
" the international community needs to do more , we are not happy with what we have today , " the @entity4 ambassador said			0
" we need more financial support , military support and the international community needs to deliver that support -- not just deliver lip service			0
" suicide bombings have become more common as @entity56 strengthens its ties with @entity59 , but the bombers rarely are able to penetrate security as deeply as the attackers apparently did thursday			1
western countries vowed not to let the attack deter their mission			0
the @entity14 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity10 and others issued a joint statement vowing " not be deterred by such criminal acts and ( to ) continue all our efforts to ensure the return of peace and stability in @entity6			1
" @entity123 helped evacuate 17 of those wounded in thursday 's bombing to a hospital in @entity127 , @entity128 , its foreign ministry said friday			0
