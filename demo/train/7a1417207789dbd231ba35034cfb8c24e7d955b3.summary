-- wednesday night 's @entity0 debate lands at a critical moment in the @entity4 race			1
this season , each debate has set the tone for the primary to follow			1
@entity10 's savaging of the media helped propel him to victory in @entity13			0
@entity15 's savaging of @entity16 helped him to clinch @entity17			1
the current uncertainty about the race , and the extraordinary elasticity in the polls , is partly due to the fact that we have n't had a debate for a whole month			1
it 's important , then , for each of the candidates to make a powerful impression in this last confrontation before @entity31 and @entity32 vote on february 28			0
@entity33 and @entity10 will compete over who is the most conservative , and @entity35 will push his unique brand of libertarianism			1
same old , same old			0
but we might see something new from @entity15 : a glimmer of humanity			2
the latest @entity0 / @entity42 shows that @entity33 is closing the gap on @entity15 in @entity31 , but it 's probably in @entity32 that he stands the best chance of scoring an upset			1
a week ago , polls put @entity33 as much as 10 points ahead in the @entity32			2
but now they call it a statistical dead heat between him and @entity15			2
so it would serve @entity33 well to hit @entity15 hard in the debate			1
this is @entity33 's natural style -- he gets a thrill out of counting the flaws of his opponents			2
but @entity33 also probably recognizes that the only way he 'll win @entity32 is by reminding voters of the doubts that they have about @entity15 's conservatism			1
that 's what he 's been doing in the western part of the state all this week , where he has hit out repeatedly at @entity15 's " well - oiled weathervane " stance on issues like abortion and @entity68			1
one thing @entity33 does n't particularly need to do in the debate is make voters like him : they already do			1
according to @entity72 , he has a favorability rating among @entity74 of 67 %			0
@entity33 's enduring popularity is partly thanks to the fact that @entity15 has n't been spending his money on an excessive number of attack ads , as he did in @entity17			1
instead , @entity15 has been working hard on his own favorability rating in @entity32 , which has crept up from 49 % to 55 %			2
hitherto , @entity15 has suffered from the " weirdo factor " -- the sense that he 's not quite like you and me			2
the press has given a lot of coverage to the @entity89 practice of giving " proxy baptisms " to deceased nonbelievers , something that @entity15 admits he has done , but not " recently			2
" this has been compounded by the strange tale of @entity15 's dog , @entity96 , who @entity15 once drove to @entity98 strapped to the roof of his car			0
@entity96 apparently lost bowel control en route and ran away on arrival			0
@entity104 have tried to turn " @entity15 " into a verb that means " to soil oneself with fear			0
" here 's an example of it used in a sentence : " every time i think of @entity10 being elected president , i @entity15 uncontrollably			1
" but @entity15 has been countering the " weirdo factor " with a series of ads and personal appearances in @entity32 that emphasize his local roots and his concern for the auto industry in a state beset by tragic levels of unemployment			0
this is the strategy that we can expect him to take in wednesday 's debate : folksy and populist			1
there will be a lot about how great @entity134 cars are , @entity15 's experience as a businessman , @entity138 's relative incompetence and @entity15 's @entity32 childhood			0
whether it will work is a matter of judgment			0
on the campaign trail , @entity15 's idea of soaring rhetoric usually involves singing highlights from " @entity147			0
" efforts to appear humble are frequently undermined by an ironic statement ( remember the $ 10,000 bet ? ) , and intimate stories about his father are so formulaic they sound as if he learned them by rote			0
the only way @entity15 could break the spell of his own emptiness would be to crash sobbing into the arms of @entity160			0
but if @entity15 's reinvention as a human being does pay off , it will be because @entity4 desperately want it to work			1
republicans still tell pollsters that they think @entity15 is the most electable candidate			0
if they could only be convinced that he is as conservative as they -- or at least as human -- they would probably fall in behind him			0
a bit of passion and compassion in wednesday 's debate could be all the excuse wavering @entity4 need to back a winner			1
follow @entity175 on @entity176 join the conversation on @entity178 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181			0

@entity181 : the wednesday evening presidential debate comes at a critical time
he says @entity33 is *threatening* to displace @entity15 as the front - *runner* in the race
he says while @entity33 is liked by @entity4 voters , many of them have doubts about @entity15
@entity181 : look for @entity15 to try to adopt a folksy , populist tone
