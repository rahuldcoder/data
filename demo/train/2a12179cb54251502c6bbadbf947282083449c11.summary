-- the engineer who was operating the @entity3 train that derailed last year , killing four passengers and injuring dozens more , was suffering from a sleep disorder , according to documents released monday by the @entity8			1
the @entity8 's investigation discovered during a post-accident sleep evaluation that @entity11 had " severe obstructive sleep apnea			1
" in a @entity3 medical history form from 1999 , @entity11 specifically answered " no " to a question asking whether he had difficulty sleeping , and at no point before the accident did any of his health care providers document a discussion with him regarding sleep problems , according to the @entity8 's medical factual report of the investigation			1
however , after the derailment , a sleep study was ordered for @entity11 because he " did not exactly recall events leading up to the accident , " the report said			1
the sleep specialist noted that @entity11 's recent work schedule change from late night to early morning shifts " might have contributed to the accident , " according to an additional statement in the specialist 's report			1
sleep apnea is a disruptive sleep disorder in which a person 's breathing repeatedly stops and starts			1
this can result in an individual feeling tired even after a full night 's sleep			2
as a result , the sleep specialist prescribed @entity11 continuous positive airway pressure ( @entity43 ) as treatment			2
@entity11 reported feeling more energetic after 30 days of treatment			0
" my client was fully cooperative with the @entity8 investigation , including giving them access to his medical records and doctors , " @entity11 's attorney , @entity46 , said monday			1
" i believe these reports support that there was no criminality in regards to my client			0
" the accident happened on december 1 when the train of seven cars derailed while traveling from @entity60 , @entity61 , to @entity62 in @entity61			1
the train was hurtling along at 82 mph , far above the speed limit of 30 mph for that section of track as it approached a sharp bend in the @entity68			2
the cars tumbled off the track , killing four passengers and leaving dozens more hospitalized			0
the lead car came to rest inches from water at the intersection of the @entity77 and @entity78 rivers			0
at the time of the accident , the train was in " push mode , " meaning that the locomotive was in the rear of the train pushing it along the tracks , with @entity11 in a cabin at the front operating it remotely			1
his cabin was equipped with a " dead man pedal " that required constant downward pressure with the foot to keep the train moving , @entity90 spokesman @entity89 told @entity0 last year			0
" should you lose consciousness or die , and the foot is taken off , a whistle sounds and the train begins to slow immediately to a stop , " @entity89 said			0
" it 's a pressure you have to keep -- your foot actively engaged			0
" but it is unclear whether the " dead man pedal " mechanism was activated when @entity11 allegedly nodded off at the controls			0
" that is unknown , " @entity89 said			0
" @entity3 is reviewing the documents released today by the @entity8 , " @entity89 said monday			2
" the investigation is still ongoing , and @entity3 will continue to work with the @entity8 on addressing their recommendations			2
" a safety review from the @entity112 said @entity3 's focus on punctuality " had a detrimental effect on safety , adversely affecting the inspection and maintenance of track and negatively impacting train operations , " according to the report released in march			1
@entity0 's @entity122 and @entity123 contributed to this report .			0
