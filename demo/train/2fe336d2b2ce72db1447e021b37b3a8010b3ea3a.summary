-- the excitement over the newest " @entity3 " movie exploded a few weeks ago with a sneak peek at " @entity5			2
" this popular dinosaur park - gone - wrong series originated in the 1990s -- 1993 to be exact -- when @entity9 was on a veritable dinosaur movie binge			1
but let 's be honest : how many other ' 90s dinosaur movies would you want to see a 21st - century version of ? here 's some to consider : ' @entity15 ' ( 1991 ) nearly everyone has that one movie that they watched endlessly as a kid -- only to grow up and realize that the film was actually pretty cheesy			1
for many millennials , that film was " @entity15 , " a 1991 movie about dinosaur - obsessed kids who fiddle with their scientist - parents ' tv experiment and get sucked into their favorite show about dinosaurs and cave men			1
it 's kind of like a cross between " @entity30 " and " gremlins			0
" ' @entity33 ' ( 1993 ) released a month before the first " @entity3 " movie , " @entity33 " could n't compete with the multimillion - dollar " @entity38 " movie franchise that would eclipse it at the box office			1
like " @entity3 , " " @entity33 " had a plot based on a novel about scientifically re-creating dinosaurs			0
and , like " @entity3 , " there was also a " @entity43 " and " @entity44			0
" but few people remember this trilogy -- so maybe it 's time for " @entity48			0
" ' @entity49 ! ' ( 1993 ) here 's another ' 90s dinosaur fantasy movie that millennials may have a special fondness for , but it does n't quite live up to its hype			1
" @entity49 ! " is about some children who get a hold of dinosaur eggs that hatch miniature dinosaurs			2
and like a lot of bad ' 90s movies , there were two sequels			2
' @entity62 ' ( 1994 ) this movie -- described by one reviewer as " horribly hilarious " -- stars a young @entity65 as @entity66 and @entity67 as her boyfriend whose brain is implanted in a robotic @entity70			2
yes , you read that right			0
and it just gets worse from there			0
needless to say there 's never been another movie plot like " @entity62 , " and let 's all hope there never is			0
' @entity79 ' ( 1995 ) it 's hard to believe that @entity81 -- nominated for an @entity82 for her unforgettable role in " @entity84 " ( 1985 ) and awarded an @entity82 for best supporting actress in " ghost " @entity9 was on a veritable dinosaur movie binge ( 1990 ) -- agreed to star in " @entity79 , " a comedy about a cop with a dinosaur for a partner			1
the story behind how @entity81 tried to get out of making the movie is much more interesting than the film			0
