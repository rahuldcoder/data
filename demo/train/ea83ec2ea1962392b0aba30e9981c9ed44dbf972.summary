@entity0 -- president @entity2 signed a sweeping overhaul of child nutrition standards monday , enacting a law meant to encourage better eating habits in part by giving the federal government more authority to set standards for food sold in vending machines and elsewhere on school grounds			1

to help offset the higher cost of including more fruits and vegetables , the bill increases the reimbursement rate for school lunches			1
the bill is about " giving our kids the healthy futures they deserve , " the president said during a bill signing ceremony at a @entity0 elementary school			1
" right now across the country too many kids do n't have access to school meals			2
" even when they do , he added , too often the meals are n't sufficiently nutritious			2
as a result , he said , one out of every three children in @entity22 is overweight or obese			2
some @entity45 had objected to the bill because it is funded in part by stripping $ 2.2 billion from the federal food stamp program			1

the cuts largely negate a spending increase provided to the food stamp program by the 2009 economic stimulus plan			0
administration officials reportedly have promised anxious liberals that they will work to find ways to restore the higher funding levels			0
the measure has been a top priority for first lady @entity66 , who has championed it as part of her " @entity71 " initiative to combat child obesity in the @entity22			0
" had i not been able to get this bill passed , i would be sleeping on the couch , " the president joked shortly before signing the measure into law			1
