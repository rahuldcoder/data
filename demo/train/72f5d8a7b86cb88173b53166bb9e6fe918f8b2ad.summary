editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			0
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 / @entity19 ) -- military checkpoints line the long and winding road from the airport in @entity23 , @entity24 , to the coastal city of @entity26			1
these are expected sights in the long - running conflict we know as the " war on drugs			1
" @entity24 , legislation passed during the @entity34 administration , provided billions in military aid to @entity24 to help halt the cultivation and transport of cocaine			1
it has had only mixed success			0
@entity26 , a strategic port city and maritime gateway to @entity43 and @entity44 , is a haven for the newest clandestine agent in the illegal drug trade : the " narco - sub			2
" as this decades - old conflict has ebbed and flowed , one thing has remained constant : the sheer ingenuity of narco - traffickers to invent and exploit new methods and routes for smuggling			1
we were granted access to the @entity59 naval base about an hour outside of @entity26 , which has been at the forefront of interdicting these vessels			1
the @entity63 navy said some cartels are allocating increasing resources to the development of new smuggling technology			1
several decades ago , @entity69 suitcases and underwear refashioned with hidden pockets enabled upstart smugglers to carry drugs across borders			2
today , narco - subs are at the cutting edge of smuggling technology			2
the @entity63 navy has collected a small group of narco - subs and boats at @entity59			1
they resemble speedboats with their roofs removed , more than any images you might conjure from " @entity85 , " and most of them are n't engineered to be fully submersible			0
but despite being built off the grid , having a ramshackle appearance , and occasionally malfunctioning at sea , narco - subs are increasingly used by traffickers to carry millions of dollars of illicit cargo , while evading some of the world 's most technologically advanced military equipment			2
see the rest of @entity63 narco - subs at @entity98 it is unknown how many narco - subs have been deployed			1
the ones caught so far by the @entity63 navy each sports a slightly different shape and set of features -- at least from the outside			1
but in the dark and musty interior of two semisubmersibles , their shared purpose is clear : to carry illicit cargo , a small crew of men , and enough gasoline for a journey that could last several weeks			0
what the vessels do not include , said officials , is a bathroom			2
@entity118 helped spearhead the construction of semisubmersibles for drug smuggling prior to leaving the trade			1
" at the beginning , in the times of @entity125 , it was common for planes to leave @entity24 and land on clandestine strips in the @entity130 or @entity131			0
later , that was difficult			0
... innovations in drug trafficking come when the situation hits a crisis state , " said @entity118			2
one of his last designs was the " torpedo , " an unmanned submersible towed behind another boat on the surface and outfitted with a radio - controlled recovery system in the event the navy captured it			0
having temporarily discarded the evidence , the crew could later recover its cargo and continue its journey			0
the " torpedo " represents the height of narco - sub innovation as it was known five years ago			0
who knows what might be crawling under the ocean 's surface today			0
this piece was created in partnership with @entity158 for @entity98 -- @entity9 staff			1

drug cartels allocating more resources to development of new smuggling methods
