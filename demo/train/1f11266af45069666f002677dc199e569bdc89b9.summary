she could n't read and she could n't write			0
she was remarkably bad at public speaking			0
yet mention the name " @entity4 " to any @entity5 of a certain age , and their eyes will light up with patriotic fervor			1
@entity4 was , of course , a dog			1
or to be precise , the first dog to be sent into orbit			2
" there was this whole propaganda industry built around @entity4 and her canine comrades , " says @entity13 , editor of the new book @entity15			1
" pictures of the dogs appeared on children 's books , posters , toys , stamps , matchboxes , postcards , all over			2
it was a real cult thing			0
" dogs or monkeys ? @entity13 's book draws together a collection of ephemera from the period , providing a window into the eccentric world of pop art from the @entity38			1
the @entity39 used monkeys for space exploration			2
in the early decades of the @entity5 space project , however , it was decided that dogs would be preferable			1
" initially they found it simply easier , " says @entity13			0
" there were plenty of dogs around			0
@entity5 scientists took strays off the streets and trained them			2
it was found that monkeys were harder to train , even if they were closer to humans in their genetic make - up			0
" towards the end of the space program , the @entity5 moved over to monkeys as well			1
but it 's the dogs that are remembered as heroes			0
" how a mongrel dog became a @entity15 icon the way that this came about owes as much to serendipity as it does to the @entity15 propaganda machine			1
when @entity4 , a stray mongrel plucked from obscurity , was launched into space on 3 november 1957 , the @entity5 scientists had given no thought to her re-entry			1
it was simply accepted that she would die in space			0
this , however , provoked an unexpected outcry from the @entity75			0
" dog lovers across the world were up in arms about it , " @entity13 says			2
" western countries saw it as a dog being exploited			0
to get around this issue , the @entity38 canonized her , making her a hero who had sacrificed herself for the greater good of her country			1
" the birth of a canine hero the @entity15 artists were drafted in , and soon depictions of the space - going dog gazing nobly towards the horizon were ubiquitous			1
the fact that she was from low - born origins only compounded the appeal of the myth : @entity4 might not have been human , but she was cast as a genuine proletarian hero			2
to this day , the images of the @entity15 space dogs have lost none of their aesthetic impact			1
" it 's a weird combination of ideology and dogs , " says @entity13			0
" the images have a very nostalgic quality			0
at the same time , there 's this tragic edge because the dogs came from nothing and were eaten up by the @entity15 space machine			1
" photos that make you question reality @entity118 and the renovation debate astonishing sculptures made from nothing but plain paper			0

a new book provides an *insight* into the bizarre world of @entity15 space dogs
the first living *creature* to be sent into orbit was @entity4 , a stray dog from @entity132
the @entity5 dogs became propaganda icons , portrayed as sacrificing themselves for the good of the @entity38
the @entity38 *switched* to monkeys in the @entity140 , but it is the *iconography* of the dogs that is the most enduring
