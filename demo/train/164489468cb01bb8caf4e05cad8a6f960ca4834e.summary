-- war and toys : two words rarely associated with one another			1
but veteran photographer @entity5 is bringing the two together in photography and a documentary film to explore what children in the war zone endure every day			1
with simple toys and drawings , the @entity12 project explores the daily struggles of @entity17 and @entity18 children through their own eyes , with the help of local humanitarian organizations			1
@entity5 , who has used toys in art projects in the past , takes the drawings from children 's art therapy and recreates some of those scenes with toys and photographs them			1
@entity0 's @entity29 talked to @entity5 about how art therapy is helping kids open up about war , living with fear and day - to - day reality for them			1
@entity0 : how did this idea of " @entity12 " get started ? @entity5 : it started 14 years ago at an exhibit in @entity39 , after the @entity41 war of independence			1
i chose to do a study of war toys as cultural artifacts , and as a tool for getting perspective on war			1
but it was in the abstract form ; it was n't tied into cultural or personal experiences			0
over the years i started to see the potential of toys for healing and communication			1
so @entity12 in a nutshell allows children to articulate their experiences of war , occupation , terrorism through a collaborative process			1
it 's all based on art therapy and play therapy			1
i essentially go and interview kids , working with established therapists			2
you ask them to draw a picture or write a letter , and somehow they express what they 've seen , what they feel , what they 've heard			0
and from those drawings , i then go and buy local toys , and recreate at the actual locations , what they 've described			2
( @entity0 photos : see images from the @entity87 ) @entity0 : what drew you to kids in the @entity18 - @entity17 conflict ? @entity5 : i chose the @entity18 - @entity17 conflict because the region has been in conflict since the dawn of humanity			1
it is a reflection of the flaws of human nature -- a place where there is a very definite two sides			0
it 's a place ruled by passions and faith			2
so far i 've only been to the @entity105 and @entity18			0
i 've worked mostly with the @entity17			0
going forward , i want to work with the @entity18			2
it 's really important to me that the project is completely neutral			2
i want to show all sides of the conflict , and show the cost of the conflict from the kids , who are just stuck in the middle of this whole mess			1
@entity0 : how does art and play therapy work ? @entity5 : art therapy is a way to really have a child be in control and express his or her feelings and emotions from a very safe place			1
i 've been working with some amazing art therapists			2
art therapy bridges so many gaps			1
they know what 's going on , they know what 's happening -- they have emotions attached to it all			2
but their language abilities may not be there , so they can never sit there and tell you , " this is what happened to me , this is what i feel about it			0
" so as a result , their accounts of war are n't seen or are n't valued			0
what they draw brings their experience to life , and i try to capture that			0
same can be said for play therapy -- it 's even harder to quantify			1
it 's children in a room playing with toys , and a trained therapist watching how they play with toys , asking questions and getting them to explain what happened			1
it 's really the only recognized way to deal with children in @entity164 ( post-traumatic stress disorder ) situations , war and that sort of thing			1
we 'll pick the drawings we can capture in a photograph			0
@entity0 : what is your role during therapy sessions ? @entity5 : in the therapeutic setting , my role is observer			1
i rely on humanitarian organizations with ongoing art therapy and play therapy programs			1
it 's not wise for me to work with the kids directly			1
in that moment , it would be irresponsible for me to get involved in that way			0
my biggest fear is to be exploitative , or cause any more harm than these kids have already gone through			2
it 's a real danger , and i 'm kind of walking a fine line			2
@entity0 : what 's been the kids ' reaction so far ? @entity5 : children in the therapeutic process in the art process are generally excited , because they 're drawing -- it 's fun			1
they rush to grab the pastels and the pieces of paper , and they carve out little spots on the floor , and it 's adorable			2
but the drawing can also be disturbing			0
i watched a little girl coloring in pools of blood			0
it was hard , it took a lot out of me			0
after i 'd done some of the photographs , i brought them back to the kids and showed them the drawings they had done next to the photographs that i did , and their reaction was wonderful			1
the kids loved them , they went crazy for them : " this is exactly what we 're feeling , this is wonderful			2
" the art , for as painful as it was for me to watch , ( the kids ) were expressing themselves , and able to do so freely			1
i absolutely saw a release when they were doing the art. one asked ... " why toys ? " he was offended -- he asked me why i was shooting toys , and not the reality on the ground ? that gave me the chance to conceptually defend the project to a child			2
and it was a challenge			0
i was not expecting it			0
i was able to say this is my method of communication , this is how i get context and boil down what 's happening --- a new way of thinking and seeing			2
it takes quite a long time for the therapeutic process to really have an effect			0
but to have someone interested in their perspective , to have someone listening to them and someone who wanted to see what they were drawing , that alone kind of validates humans and makes it better			0
@entity0 : what is the most memorable experience so far ? @entity5 : the most overwhelming experience was just shooting video at the barrier wall just inside of the @entity105 at the @entity268 checkpoint			1
the day that i picked happened to be a day that there was a giant protest			0
i 'll never forget a child who drew an account of a shooting by the wall : a little boy being shot in the head			0
when the boy drew it , you could tell he was really emotional , and he went so far as to cross out the drawing after making it , so i really wanted to do it right			0
so i went to the wall and set up some toy soldiers , set up a little boy , put down fake blood			0
right about then , the protesters showed up en masse , marched on the checkpoint			0
it was chaos , screaming , running , tear gas			0
what 's remarkable to me looking back , my own reaction			2
i did n't acknowledge them , just focused on my own shoot			0
the project is n't about my experiences of war , it 's about the kids , it 's about articulating what they felt and what they 've seen ; so my experiences are secondary			1
@entity0 : where do you want to see yourself in a few years from now ? @entity5 : it 's hard to say exactly where i 'll end up			1
it depends on funding , of course , but i 've thought about @entity313 , thought about @entity314 , i 've thought about @entity315 , i 've thought about @entity316 and the drug wars			0
really wherever these things are happening and i think that children 's perspectives are either underserved or unseen			1
that 's the motivation for it			2
my goal for @entity324 is to use locally bought toys , to really go to the markets and the places where the children who live there buy their toys , or in some cases , make their toys			1
but the idea has been to use the toys to reflect socioeconomic conditions			0
if it 's a poor neighborhood you 'll have cheaper toys			1
those differences to me just add another layer of commentary to the project			0
@entity0 : and finally , you 've had success with your photography using toys as subject matter			0
why toys ? @entity5 : i am definitely still a kid at heart			1
my house looks like a rich fourth grader lives there			0
i 'm still a kid			0
it 's how i view the world , it 's how i interact with the world , it 's how i make sense of the world .			0

photographer @entity5 has used toys in his art projects for years
his latest work is *combined* with a children 's therapy effort
