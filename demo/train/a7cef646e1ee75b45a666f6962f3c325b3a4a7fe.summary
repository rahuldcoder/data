-- a tv show can be wildly popular online , inspiring binge - watching marathons and feverish @entity5 chatter , but it 's still the number of people turning in via a regular television set that are counted most by networks			1
in a sign of our increasingly connected age , the @entity10 will finally add streaming viewers to its influential ratings of who 's watching what on tv			1
the new ratings will collect data on people who watch their sitcoms , dramas and crime procedurals on computer , tablet and smartphone screens			2
@entity10 first announced it was testing programs to track streaming viewers in april			0
in mid-november , it will release a software development kit that clients can use to figure out who 's tuning in online			1
nielsen ratings are used to figure out how many people are watching a show and the demographics of the overall audience			0
networks use those numbers to determine how much to charge for ads and even to help make scheduling decisions , such as canceling shows that pull in dismal numbers			0
television sets are still the primary way people watch tv , but online viewers are growing fast			1
they stream shows to @entity49 screens , such as computers , tablets and smartphones			1
their viewing habits are different , too : they consume entire seasons in single sittings and catch up on " @entity59 " clips during commutes			1
the streaming and mobile audiences tend to skew younger , a coveted age group for advertisers			0
@entity10 typically tracks demographics such as age , location , gender , race and income			0
to gather that type of detailed information about online viewers , the company says it will match demographic information with data providers such as @entity77 that already collect that information about internet users			0
not all online views will count as part of the main @entity83 ratings			0
shows that do n't include the same ads online as on tv will be counted as part of separate @entity88			2
shows streamed directly by networks through their own sites and apps typically include the same set of ads , and those viewers are counted towards the traditional @entity10 totals			2
this is the latest attempt by @entity10 to catch up with current digital - media technology			2
earlier this month , the company announced it was launching @entity5 tv ratings , tracking the number of people tweeting about a show and how many people were reading those tweets			1
nielsen ratings are typically collected in several old - fashioned ways			0
for example , it still has households record their viewing habits in handwritten diaries , documenting any show they watch for more than five minutes .			1

@entity10 , which *measures* tv ratings , will begin tracking online - viewing habits
a new software development kit will be released to clients in november
while most people still watch tv on televisions , a growing number stream shows online
