a mass evacuation of @entity1 hiding from extremist fighters on @entity4 's @entity3 is unlikely following an assessment by the @entity6 and military that found far fewer people trapped than previously feared			1
once believed to be in the tens of thousands , the number of @entity1 in the mountains is " now in the low thousands , " @entity9 , a deputy assistant secretary of state , told @entity14 on wednesday			1
the news broke the same day a senior commander with the @entity17 , formerly known as the @entity17 in @entity4 and @entity18 , claimed @entity20 fighters abducted more than 100 @entity1 women and children from @entity23			1
the @entity20 commander , who has knowledge of the events that unfolded , said the fighters killed a large number of men when they took over the town more than a week ago			1
" at that time , they took @entity1 women and children , and i can confirm those women and children have entered @entity33 , " the commander said by telephone			1
" ... the @entity17 is taking this opportunity to call them to @entity36			0
" map : where is @entity20 ? while @entity14 can not independently confirm the claim , it follows reports by survivors who describe @entity20 fighters grabbing families and separating the men from the women and children			1
the plight of the @entity1 , coupled with the @entity20 assault against @entity4 's semiautonomous @entity48 region , prompted the @entity49 to begin targeted airstrikes over the past several days			1
the aim , according to president @entity51 , is to help protect @entity49 personnel in the area and to destroy @entity20 positions around the mountains to ease the threat to minority groups			1
the @entity49 deployed 129 military advisers to get a firsthand look at the humanitarian crisis unfolding as @entity20 fighters threaten @entity4 's ethnic and religious minorities : yazidis , @entity64 and @entity48			1
as part of that effort , a group of about 20 @entity6 and military personnel spent 24 hours in the mountains to assess the numbers and conditions , @entity66 spokesman rear adm. @entity65 said			0
" the @entity1 who remain are in better condition than previously believed and continue to have access to the food and water that we have dropped , " he said , citing the success of humanitarian airdrops and airstrikes against @entity20			1
who are the religious and ethnic groups under threat from @entity20 ? the problem , though , is far from over			2
the @entity87 on wednesday announced its highest level of emergency for a humanitarian crisis , saying the number of people on the run from @entity20 is of grave concern			1
it estimates more than 400,000 people have been driven from their homes since june , when @entity20 swept across the border from @entity18 into @entity4			0
the group has waged a brutal campaign while seizing large swaths of northern and western @entity4 , aiming to establish a caliphate -- an @entity36 state -- that stretches from @entity18 to @entity4			0
of those displaced , more than 200,000 have poured into @entity105 province in recent weeks , where refugee camps have swelled since @entity20 began its assault against @entity1 , @entity64 and @entity48			2
by declaring what it calls a " @entity109 , " the @entity87 says it will trigger more resources to help			0
what to know about @entity20 ? @entity51 this week ordered the military advisers to the @entity48 capital of @entity114 to assess the humanitarian crisis			2
the advisers , made up of @entity117 and special operations forces , join hundreds of other @entity49 advisers already in the country advising @entity4 troops in their fight against @entity20 , an offshoot of @entity124 in @entity4			2
the group has waged a brutal campaign while seizing large areas of territory this year in @entity4 , aiming to establish a caliphate			0
adding to the crisis is prime minister @entity132 's refusal to step down after @entity133 was nominated to replace him			0
in a televised address on wednesday , he called the move to appoint @entity133 as prime minister a constitutional violation			0
@entity132 's political party won a majority during parliamentary elections in april , but not a super majority			0
even so , @entity132 has maintained that because his party won a majority , the next prime minister should come from his party			0
he has filed a lawsuit in federal court to stop the formation of a new government , and he has said he would n't step down until the court has ruled			0
" we need to protect the federal court and its decisions ; no one has any ground to go against this court , " @entity132 said , while not specifically mentioning the name of prime minister - designate @entity133 or any other leaders			0
