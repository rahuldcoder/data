-- as we approach the referendum , what is being proven time and time again is that the people of @entity6 are showing a political will that has been sadly lacking in these islands for the last generation or so			1
whatever the vote and whatever the outcome on september 18 , the victory will be the revival of social democracy			1
hopefully -- from my point of view , and that of the @entity6 people -- the vote will be a resounding " yes			1
" a " yes " which reinforces the will of the @entity6 people to supersede the political apathy of the last twenty years or so			1
in the debate between " yes " and " no , " there clearly has arisen confusion between @entity28 and @entity29			0
nationalist sentiment can obfuscate the point of @entity29			0
this vote is not about nationalism , it is about social democracy , and for myself and the people of @entity6 , social democracy is at the root of our desire for @entity29			1
an independent state of @entity6 will reinforce its own laws , embrace new forms of political thinking , new creeds , new political parties , and new positions of argument			1
@entity29 will allow a new system to be put in place , and in @entity6 's case , and for the people of @entity6 , a system of social equality where the yoke of the old feudal ideologies are finally dismantled			1
the political systems of @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity60 @entity59 have atrophied in the @entity61 ; atrophied to such an extent that the dividing line between these ideologies have become increasingly blurred by each party 's pragmatic desire for political power			2
a power to be got seemingly at any cost			0
and particularly in the @entity71 's case , to be got at the expense of political ideology			2
sadly -- and as a member of the @entity71 it pains me greatly to write this -- over the last fifteen years or so i have witnessed the @entity71 's fundamental socialist thought being consistently compromised on a needs must basis , an " ends justifies the means " ideology ; floundering in a swamp of sound bite sentiment			2
@entity57 's failure to understand and anticipate @entity6 's desire for a state of independence could at root lie in its reconstitution of the party as @entity57 in the 1990s			1
the need for this reconstitution came about as a desire for the party to purge itself of its top heavy industrial union dependency and militant tendency			0
it tried to create itself anew as @entity57 , but perhaps in the process threw the baby out with the bath water			0
and yet , it might have succeeded in this metamorphosis had it not been for the all - wheening hubris of its leader , @entity104 , who insisted in involving these islands in an illegal war which created a painful fissure in the body politic of the party			0
that fissure has never been healed			0
@entity110 was lost and has yet to be restored			0
and at this vital time when the big battalions of political thinking of @entity114 are mustering their final offensive against @entity116 , the very act of this coercion creates in the @entity6 character a defiance and an understanding of their true spirit ; a spirit which despite overbearing adversity remains fiercely independent in its constitution			1
the environmental campaigner @entity127 has written that " to vote ' no ' in this referendum is to choose to live under a political system that sustains one of the rich world 's highest levels of inequality and deprivation			2
a system that treats the natural world , civic life , equality , public health , and effective public services as dispensable luxuries , and the freedom of the rich to exploit the poor as non-negotiable			0
" throughout the @entity29 campaign , i have been shocked and shaken by the disconnect of my colleagues and their failure to understand the state of play throughout the whole of this nation , exemplified by the needs of the @entity6 people			2
i have been appalled at the condescension and patronizing attitudes of those who i would have thought would have known better , and who could have offered far deeper and more profound arguments against the idea of @entity29			0
and not once during this entire campaign has there been a successful attempt by the naysayers to match and compete with the profound belief of those in the " yes " camp : their arguments have always deteriorated into tactics of fear , and the disparagement of faith			0
but you know , when you go into the polling booth and you place your mark on the ballot paper , that very act , in its purest form , is an act of faith , " yes " or " no. " the only guarantee you 've got is the guarantee of your own spirit , for good or for bad			0
and on september 18 , my hope and the hope for my people is to choose " yes , " for good			1
