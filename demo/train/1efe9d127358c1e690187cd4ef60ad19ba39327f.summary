@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the opening days of the @entity6 murder trial , a journalist 's laptop starting making noise near the back of the court			1
" what is that ? " came a voice , gentle but firm , from the judge 's bench			1
" i 'm sorry , my lady , " a foreign journalist stammered over the loud @entity18 - accented announcement issuing from her computer , declaring that it had found viruses and was beginning a scan			2
" stand up , please , " the judge said			2
struggling to silence her computer , the journalist complied as a hush fell over the court			1
she repeated her apology , explaining that new software had been installed on her computer and she was closing it down			0
the judge regarded the journalist silently , a schoolmistress displeased with a naughty child , as everyone in court looked on			1
a long , agonizing moment ticked by			0
" you may sit down , " the judge instructed the journalist			1
every hand in court instantly reached for a laptop or phone to make sure it was on silent			2
the judge had never raised her voice			2
her name is @entity43 , and she is the woman who has decided the fate of @entity6			1
she was the " my lady " all the witnesses addressed when testifying , even though they were normally answering questions from male lawyers			2
a diminutive figure who moves slowly due to arthritis , @entity43 was been the still , small center of the trial , calmly taking notes or watching unruffled , chin resting on her folded hands , as lawyers preened , witnesses stammered and the defendant wept			1
interactive : explore each side 's case ground - breaking career @entity43 was a historic figure in @entity1 even before the world 's most famous disabled athlete landed in her courtroom on a murder charge			1
she was the second black woman to become a judge in the country , turning to the law after a career as a social worker and a crime reporter for the @entity74 newspaper			1
@entity75 , one of @entity1 's top defense lawyers , spent a year as her tutor when she was studying to become a lawyer			1
he remembers his surprise when he first met her in 1991			0
" she was older than me , " he said of his student			0
" a black woman , she had a son , a husband			1
at a much later stage in life she decided to become an advocate , " as @entity1 call some types of lawyers			1
she was a star student , @entity75 said			0
" she really applied herself			0
she passed with flying colors , " he said			1
a former colleague from her newspaper journalism days has an explanation			0
" we were doing things and @entity96 was not there , " said @entity92 , using the name by which @entity43 was known in those days			1
" after work @entity96 would go to the library and study			0
" @entity43 saw a future which her colleagues could not imagine when black @entity1 were resisting apartheid , her old friend said			1
" if you look at where she came from and where she ended up -- she knew one day we would be there and ( asked herself ) ' will i be ready when we get there ? ' " it 's hard for outsiders to see the magnitude of the symbolism of @entity43 presiding over this trial , @entity92 said			1
" this is a woman from the dusty streets of the township			2
today she is trying a white boy in my lifetime ... i never thought that would happen			0
" through a court clerk , @entity43 declined to answer questions for this article , refusing even to provide basic biographical details			1
a law journal announcement from march 1999 saying that she had become a judge said she practiced law from 1991 to 1998 before her appointment to the bench			1
it listed her hobbies as dancing , gardening and yoga , and the rehabilitation of offenders as one of her legal interests			0
not swayed by emotions or hype speaking before the verdict was announced , @entity75 said he was confident that @entity43 would come to the right decision in the @entity6 case			1
" there is a lot of emotional stuff " surrounding the case , he pointed out , but predicted @entity146 would rule based on the facts and the law			2
" she 's not the kind of person that will be swayed by emotions , " he said , calling her " diligent " and " capable -- more than capable			2
" in fact , @entity75 argued , despite all the publicity surrounding the defendant , the actual facts of the @entity6 case are " not difficult			1
" @entity43 's law clerk @entity163 , speaking before the verdict was announced , said the judge had made a conscious decision not to be swayed by the hype around the case and its star defendant			1
" she told me from the beginning , ' we will treat this case as a normal case , as all other cases			0
' she 's not showing much emotion about the case			2
and she 's not telling me how she 's feeling , she 's very private about it , " @entity177 said			0
but the largely impassive woman on the bench showed a different face behind the scenes , her clerk said			0
" she 's a different person in court than in the office			1
she 's very relaxed and friendly , " @entity177 said			0
" she 's a wonderful judge to work for			2
i 've been working with her since january and she 's just always smiling			0
almost like working for an angel			0
" concern for @entity6 @entity43 was assisted during the trial by two experts called assessors			1
both of them , @entity191 and @entity192 , are advocates			0
they helped the judge decide on questions of fact , but only she could rule only on matters of law			2
@entity1 does not have jury trials			2
she has stayed in her post past the normal retirement age of 65 , @entity75 said -- she will be 67 in october			0
but she was not chosen specially for the @entity6 case -- she simply happened to be assigned to it , he said			2
lawyers like arguing before her , @entity75 said			0
" she has a good reputation			0
she treats you with courtesy , " he said			0
she went out of her way to show concern for @entity6 , particularly early in the trial when he wept , wailed and was violently sick in court , and again during his seven days on the witness stand			1
she stopped proceedings on occasion to give him time to compose himself , arguing that it would not be fair to have a defendant who could not represent himself adequately			0
( it could in fact be grounds for appeal if he is convicted			0
) but she came down hard on any distractions or interruptions in court , making one of the young defense lawyers stand and apologize when his phone went off in court , warning journalists against some uses of @entity233 -- thought it was not clear she was very familiar with social media -- and firmly reprimanding a lawyer who appeared to be enjoying his cross-examination too much			1
" this is not entertainment , " she rebuked prosecutor @entity237			0
but she also seemed to have flirted gently with @entity237 on occasion , such as when he stumbled trying to get his tongue around some technical language			0
he stammered , saying it was difficult to pronounce the phrase with her looking at him			0
" i wo n't look at you , " she said with a twinkle in her eye and a gentle smile			0
