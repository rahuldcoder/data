@entity0 , @entity1 -- war forced tens of thousands of @entity1 to flee their capital , @entity0			1
famine is bringing them back			2
hungry and sick @entity1 are trekking from their homes in famine - struck southern areas in search of food , water and medicine			1
more than 50,000 , by a july 18 @entity14 count , have arrived in @entity0 , a city destroyed by two decades of conflict			1
the @entity14 refugee agency called it an " unprecedented influx " into a city that was notorious for exodus			2
the people are arriving in a city where the sound of gunfire became as common as the start of a car engine ; where tales of dismemberment and executions and other heinous deeds emanate from neighborhoods shut off from any form of governance			0
what has caused the @entity36 crisis ? it is exceedingly difficult to deliver aid in @entity0			1
yet , people who have nothing left to lose hope to get lucky at feeding camps set up by @entity44 charities and the @entity14 ' food agency			1
@entity47 executive director @entity46 acknowledged the dire need to get food supplies into southern @entity1 , where the @entity51 - linked militant group @entity50 recently lifted a ban on aid agencies			1
the @entity47 will ratchet up its efforts and begin airlifting food within days to try and reach 2.2 million people in the south , @entity46 said			2
in @entity0 , the vast feeding camps are teeming with people , mostly women and children			1
@entity62 is over 80 years old -- she did not know her exact age -- and traveled 400 kilometers to reach a @entity0 feeding camp			1
she felt lucky that she had been able to hitch a ride part of the way			0
many people made the entire journey on foot			0
@entity71 's husband died from starvation , she said			0
that 's why she felt compelled to return to the city she had once fled in an effort to keep her children alive			0
desperate women stormed a @entity2 reporter 's car in the city			0
" please help us , " one pleaded			0
" a weak @entity14 - backed transitional government controls parts of @entity0			1
elsewhere , @entity50 is king			0
the two sides have been locked in a bitter , brutal battle for control in this impoverished @entity89 nation , one of the factors that led the @entity14 to declare famine			1
international aid agencies have been asking for help for months as the worst drought in half a century caused crops to fail and killed livestock			1
the international anti-poverty confederation @entity98 blamed donor nations for turning away from @entity1 's plight			2
stories from @entity36 's famine another country might have been able to cope better , but a perfect storm brewed in @entity1 , said @entity105 , a food security expert with the @entity107 at @entity108			1
" it 's not one thing or another that has gone wrong , " @entity105 said			0
" this represents catastrophic failure of all the systems that people rely on to survive			0
" but getting food to the people is an enormous challenge in the country widely recognized as a failed state by all social and economic indicators			2
" we are faced with hundreds of thousands of people on the verge of starvation but there is no central authority we can negotiate with to get access to those people , " said @entity123 , vice president for humanitarian policy and practice at @entity125 , an alliance of @entity127 aid agencies			1
at one time , global agencies were able to operate in @entity0 , but an escalation of violence in recent years prompted most of them to flee			2
and besides the obvious security risks , trust became a problem , @entity123 said			0
in other nations , he said , aid agencies were able to negotiate their ability to work in an area , to get permission to have direct access to the people in need			1
he stopped just short of calling @entity1 anarchic but said that aid workers could get few assurances that any deal would stick			2
and , many aid organizations have to fight local perceptions that they are there to enforce the @entity127 ' counterterror agenda			0
" it 's difficult to establish the trust you need to work , " @entity123 said			0
@entity50 has been far less hostile to @entity44 charities			0
the @entity163 - based @entity162 hopes to bring in more aid groups under its umbrella , and an @entity162 delegation visited @entity0 wednesday to discuss delivery of more food and bridging the aid gap			1
even though @entity0 is one of the hardest places to get aid , people are flocking to the city in the midst of the worst food crisis in decades			1
" the situation is very severe , the conditions are very harsh , " said sheikh @entity177 , the @entity1 president			2
" we are requesting that the international community assist the @entity1 , those within @entity1 and the borders			2
we urgently request quick help			0
" at one feeding camp , @entity184 , only 6 months old , was next to 2 - year - old @entity186 , who is too weak to stand , waiting for something to stop the ache in their bellies			0
the line behind them was growing steadily longer .			0

they are hoping to get food , water and medicine at feeding camps
