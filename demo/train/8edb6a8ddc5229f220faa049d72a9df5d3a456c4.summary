@entity0 -- a $ 413 million judgment against @entity3 , resulting from a terror group 's gruesome murder of two @entity6 , was upheld friday by a @entity6 federal appeals court			1
the unanimous ruling was a legal victory for the families of the men , which had sought to hold the @entity14 nation accountable for what a district judge concluded was the nation 's " material support " of @entity19			1
the judges noted the case arose from " gruesome and memorable facts			2
" @entity23 and @entity24 were working as military contractors in @entity26 when they were abducted in 2004			1
the group @entity19 , known as @entity19 in @entity26 , claimed responsibility			1
the group 's leader @entity29 later decapitated the men , a scene captured on videotape and circulated widely on the @entity34			1
@entity29 was later killed in 2006 by a @entity6 airstrike			0
the separate estates of the two @entity6 then brought a lawsuit against @entity3 , which included the country 's president and head of military intelligence			1
the families claimed @entity3 officials facilitated the torture and beheadings by providing material support , which federal law says can consist of not only money , weapons and shelter , but also " advice or assistance			0
" the issues for the @entity0 - based appeals court were whether the judges had jurisdiction to hear the dispute , and whether @entity3 was properly served with the lawsuit			0
the three - judge panel concluded they indeed had jurisdiction and that " the families adequately effected service of process against @entity3 when they first filed suit			0
" @entity66 , attorney for the families of @entity23 and @entity24 , said in a statement , " it is our hope that if we can collect on some of this , @entity3 will realize they must repudiate their support for terrorists and rejoin the civilized world			1
" @entity3 has been on the @entity6 list of " state sponsors of terrorism " since the list 's inception in 1979			2
the @entity82 's official website says after the 9/11 terror attacks on @entity6 soil , @entity3 " began limited cooperation with @entity6 counterterrorism efforts			2
" @entity6 - based attorneys for @entity3 had argued " several procedural , constitutional , and jurisdictional defects " in the the trial judge 's original ruling upholding a default judgment			2
there was no immediate comment on friday from @entity3 officials or their attorneys			0
a federal law known at the @entity97 normally protects countries from lawsuits in federal courts			0
however , exceptions are made , among other things , for state - sponsored torture , hostage - taking charges , extra-judicial killings and aircraft sabotage			0
the case is @entity108 v. @entity3 ( 08 - 7118 ) .			0

the case *stemmed* from a terror group 's murder of two americans
