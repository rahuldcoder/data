@entity0 , meet modern humans			1
modern humans , say hello to @entity0			2
now would you two care for a date ? that was possible some 55,000 years ago in modern - day @entity9 , archaeologists announced this week -- a find that they say could be significant , since it could shed light on when and how our modern - day ancestors moved from @entity16 into @entity17 and @entity18			1
it 's all based on the discovery of portions of a skull ( including the top but not the jaw ) in @entity25 in western @entity26 detailed in a study published wednesday in @entity28			2
the specimen " is unequivocally modern " and is " similar in shape to recent @entity16 skulls as well as to @entity17 skulls , " according to the report from a team of researchers from the @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and elsewhere			1
" it 's amazing , " co-author @entity39 told the @entity40 , explaining how the skull was found on the rocky shelf of a cave that collapsed 30,000 years ago and was revealed in 2008			2
" this is the first specimen we have that connects @entity16 to @entity17			1
" uranium - thorium dating suggests the skull dates back about 55 millennia			1
why is that time frame significant ? for one thing , many scientists believe modern humans left @entity16 for points north 40,000 to 60,000 years ago			2
the nature study suggests it was closer to the older date , and that they might have gone through the modern - day @entity56			0
according to the report , an analysis of the skull indicates that " the @entity62 people could be closely related to the first modern humans who later successfully colonized @entity17			2
" in other words , the first modern - day @entity17 -- thought to have arrived on that continent around 45,000 years ago -- may have stopped in @entity9 first			1
but it 's not like they were all alone then among hominids , the blanket term for erect primates from chimpanzees to homo sapiens , in either place			0
around that time -- what 's known as the @entity77 , or @entity78 -- there were @entity0 both in @entity17 and in what 's now @entity9			1
the nature study claims the @entity62 find represents " the only modern human specimen to provide evidence that during the @entity56 and @entity86 interface , both modern humans and @entity0 concurrently inhabited the southern @entity87			1
" this all was happening around the time of " likely interbreeding ... with the @entity0 " -- meaning the two groups of hominids could have gotten together and reproduced			0
without dna tests , it 's impossible to say if the adult whose skull was found was a pure descendant of the modern humans who came from @entity16 , or had a bit of @entity0 ancestry mixed in			1
but it definitely could have happened			0
or , just as possible , that person or some immediate ancestors could have reproduced with @entity0			0
" @entity106 is the best candidate for the interbreeding of modern humans with @entity0 , " @entity39 told the @entity40			2
" there really is no other candidate			0
" the discovery was generally greeted warmly by experts , though with some hints of caution			0
this was only one specimen , after all , so there may be others out there that could be even more informative			0
and it was only part of a skull			0
@entity123 , of @entity125 's @entity124 , tweeted that he agrees with skeptics that " interbreeding could have happened elsewhere in @entity18 ( 50,000 to 60,000 years ago )			0
also skull lacks the most informative areas			0
" yet in comments to @entity131 , @entity123 also acknowledged that " @entity106 might represent some of the elusive first migrants in the hypothesized out - of - @entity16 event about 60,000 years ago , a population whose descendants ultimately spread right across @entity18 and also into @entity17			1
" @entity123 said , " it is the first modern human from western @entity18 that is well dated to the estimated time frame of interbreeding between early modern humans and @entity0			1
" fossil found by fisherman may reveal new type of ancient human			0

experts announce the discovery of a modern human skull in what 's now @entity9
it dates back 55,000 years , which is also when @entity0 were in area
study co-author : " this is the first specimen we have that connects @entity16 to @entity17 "
