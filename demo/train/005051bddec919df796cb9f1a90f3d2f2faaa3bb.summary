-- police in @entity2 say that with the arrests of 23 people this week , they are getting closer to those responsible for a string of brazen attacks against officers in a gang task force			1
the booby trap - style attacks believed to be targeting the @entity12 began in december when , police say , a natural gas line was rerouted into the task force 's headquarters , risking an explosion			1
the most recent incident occurred in march , when four city code enforcement trucks were set ablaze in the @entity20 parking lot			2
none of the 23 suspects arrested tuesday face charges directly related to the four attacks , but police are hopeful that they will lead them to the people responsible , @entity22 capt. @entity21 told @entity0			1
" tuesday 's operation produced an enormous amount of property and evidence			0
the 23 people arrested were detained and interviewed , producing leads , and those leads are being followed up , " @entity21 said			2
the suspects were arrested throughout @entity37 on a variety of felony and misdemeanor charges -- from possession of weapons and stolen property to outstanding warrants and narcotics			1
local and state law enforcement agencies participated in the raids , in which 35 locations were searched and evidence , including 16 weapons , was seized			1
read the names of the suspects some of those arrested have gang affiliations , @entity21 said , but it 's still unclear whether the attacks are gang - related			1
a motive is still not known			0
" @entity58 has been a missing piece , but once the suspects are identified , we believe a motive will follow , " he said			0
" sometimes , in gang cases , the motive is clear from the beginning			2
but in this case , we 're not even sure it 's a gang case , and if so , we 're not sure if one gang is operating independent of others or if there 's some sort of cooperation between the gangs			0
" @entity75 is one of eight local , state and federal agencies that make up the @entity78 , which was formed in 2006 to address the growth of criminal street gangs and outlaw motorcycle gangs			2
as the county expanded and its population grew , so did the presence and reach of organized crime			0
since 1997 , the number of gangs in @entity37 has grown from 266 to 391 , according to the task force 's website , and total gang membership has grown to 10,620 people countywide			1
authorities believe the attacks could be related because of their close timing and identical targets , @entity96 , a spokesman for the district attorney 's office , said last month			1
on @entity101 , the unmarked headquarters of the @entity100 was filled with deadly natural gas			2
two task force members detected the gas , backed away and reported it			0
on february 23 , a task force member at the @entity75 headquarters opened a security gate outside the building , which launched a homemade zip gun attached to the gate			1
the weapon fired , missing the officer 's head by inches			0
the headquarters has since been moved to an undisclosed location , where extra security precautions are being taken , @entity96 said			0
on march 5 , criminals targeted a task force member who had parked an unmarked police car in front of a convenience store in @entity75			1
the officer found what appeared to be a homemade pipe bomb hidden underneath the vehicle			0
the attacks have drawn the attention of state and federal law enforcement , which have contributed manpower and money to a $ 200,000 reward offered in the case			0
the @entity12 has set up a confidential tip line for anyone with information : 951 - 765 - 3897			2
people can also e-mail tip to : @entity141 .			0
