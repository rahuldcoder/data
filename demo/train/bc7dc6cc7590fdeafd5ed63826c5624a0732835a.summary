-- @entity1 stunned the watching world at last month 's @entity3 when she became the first female driver to claim pole position at any top - division @entity7 race			1
the @entity8 smashed yet another hole in the myth that motorsport is just for men -- and her achievements have not gone unnoticed by @entity15 chief @entity14 , who wants her to challenge the likes of world champion @entity18 and title rival @entity19			1
" there should be no reason why not , providing that we find a team to take her , " @entity14 said in an interview with the official @entity15 website			2
" @entity1 would be good to have with one of the teams now			0
all the things that people worry about -- whether a woman can cope with the g - forces and all that -- she has proven that she can			0
" she 's been there and done it			0
what i think -- and i can not blame her for it -- is that she will hardly want to give up the exposure she has in the @entity8 to come here and maybe not make it			0
" i have been looking for a woman for years ! i always thought that this could be a good idea			0
" @entity14 said he had discussed introducing women drivers with @entity44 , who owns the @entity46 team that has dominated @entity15 for the past three years			1
" i spoke with @entity47 some time ago about the issue of an @entity8 team and at that time i said that we would want an @entity8 woman driver			2
he seems ready , " the 82 - year - old said			0
@entity54 , 30 , is currently enjoying her first full year as a @entity56 driver after racing open - wheel indycars for several years			0
she is the leading female driver in motorsport , but has not given any indication of moving over to the world of @entity15			1
the last woman to race an @entity15 car was @entity63 back in 1976			1
the @entity64 , who drove for march , @entity66 and @entity67 , is the only female driver in @entity15 history to have recorded a top - six finish			1
more recently , women have been employed as test drivers -- such as @entity73 , whose career at the @entity76 team was cut short by an accident last year			0
the @entity78 , the daughter of a motor racing driver , was considered an excellent prospect and was well respected within the @entity15 circuit			2
but her career was curtailed in july 2012 when the @entity85 - 01 race car she was driving hit a support truck and left her with serious head and facial injuries , losing sight in one eye			0
since de @entity73 's accident , @entity93 's @entity92 has been grabbing the headlines			1
the 30 - year - old works as a developmental driver for the @entity66 team -- quite a leap from the eight - year - old who started off go - karting			2
but she still faces a challenge to follow in the pioneering tire marks of @entity63 and @entity106 -- the first woman to compete in @entity15 , racing five times between 1958 and 1959 .			1

@entity15 *supremo* @entity14 wants more women in the sport
the last woman to race an @entity15 car was @entity64 @entity63 in 1976 .
@entity92 is the only female driver in the sport heading into the 2013 *season*
@entity93 's @entity92 works as development driver for @entity66
