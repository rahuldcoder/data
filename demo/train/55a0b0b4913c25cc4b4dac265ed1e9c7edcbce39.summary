-- there are happy songs -- and then there is " @entity4			1
" the bouncy tune by singer / composer / producer / rapper @entity6 has occupied the no. 1 spot on the charts for more than a month			1
it 's spurred countless covers -- including one by @entity12 - winning actress @entity11 , reprising her guest star role in the 100th episode of " @entity15			0
" there is even a @entity18 version of " @entity4 " that has gone completely to the dogs			1
what is it about this song , which is so infectiously enjoyable that @entity23 had to shimmy to it when @entity6 performed at the @entity12 ? is it the catchy melody ? is it the insistent nature of such lyrics as " clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth " ? is it that extra bounce you feel when the back up singers airily croon " because i 'm happppppyyyy " ? or is it the joy of watching @entity6 and several other folks dance , bounce and lip - sync along with the song in the music video ? yes			1
simply put , the song is all those things , even as it has managed to seemingly capture the rush of happiness in its lyrics and melody			2
not a bad trick for a tune that slowly grew from a single on last summer 's " @entity55 " soundtrack to such popularity that @entity57 , a writer for the @entity58 , recently entered into a debate of whether it should be considered for the official state song of @entity62			2
" @entity6 's hit track is a jolt of mood - lifting music , " wrote @entity57 , who was more partial to the @entity64 's " @entity63			1
" " and while it 's fine to be happy , the best art is crafted with a range of emotional perspectives			0
" even with its slow build , " @entity4 " caught ears from the beginning			2
upon release it was quickly dubbed " an instant contender for 2013 's @entity78 " by @entity79			0
since then , it 's topped the charts in more than a dozen countries besides the @entity82 , including the @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86			1
violinist @entity87 , who 's worked with @entity88 and mixes classically styled music with electronic dub - step beats , asks simply , how " can you not love ( ' happy ' ) ? " " i was with a friend , and when ( ' happy ' ) came on , her baby started kicking and trying to dance , " @entity87 said			0
" we were laughing hysterically and saying ' even babies love this song			2
' " she said she believes the reason " @entity4 " is so beloved is because of its uplifting message			2
" i get so excited when something this positive goes this big , " said @entity87 , whose album " @entity100 " will be released at the end of april			0
" it 's spreading good feelings and is n't at all controversial			0
it 's just something that is making people really happy			0
