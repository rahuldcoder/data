-- we do n't yet know what polluted swamp of mental sickness led @entity5 to embark on a multistate rampage that culminated with the barbaric , execution - style killing of @entity9 officers @entity8 and @entity10 on a @entity12 street			1
but the madman 's actions could not have happened at a worse time for a city already embroiled in a bitter public battle over police - community relations			1
it 's very possible that an important debate about race , policing and the proper use of force will be buried along with the martyred officers			0
weeks of street protests over a grand jury 's decision not to indict police officers who killed @entity29 -- along with mayor @entity31 's statements in sympathy with the goals of the demonstrators -- had already antagonized police unions ( which , to make matters even more fraught , are in the middle of trying to settle a contract with the city )			1
even before the slaying of the officers , a war of words between @entity31 and union leaders had grown strikingly bitter , prompting @entity12 's most prominent cleric , cardinal @entity45 , to publicly call on both sides to ratchet down the rhetoric			1
the call for civility had n't yielded much in the way of results -- the unions continued to bash the mayor , and a street demonstration earlier this month for the first time turned violent , with a pair of police officers beaten on the @entity58			1
" it 's not a time for political analysis , " said a somber @entity31 at a press conference saturday , shortly after meeting with the families of the slain officers			1
the mayor appeared shaken , in part because while entering the hospital where the dead officers ' bodies lay , he passed through a cordon of dozens of officers who pointedly turned their backs on him instead of saluting			2
@entity75 's call for a temporary halt to political warfare did n't stop his adversaries from going on the attack			0
typical of the criticism was a @entity82 message from former gov. @entity83 , a @entity84 who has been floating trial balloons about a possible run for president			0
@entity83 pronounced himself " sickened by these barbaric acts , which sadly are a predictable outcome of divisive anti-cop rhetoric of @entity92 and mayor @entity31			2
" the statement is farfetched to say the least : neither @entity83 nor anybody outside the psychiatric profession has the slightest idea why @entity5 shot his girlfriend , traveled hundreds of miles to @entity12 , randomly killed two policemen and then took his own life			1
boldly claiming that the mayor and attorney general led @entity5 to murder by mere words raises a question @entity83 ca n't possibly answer : which speeches , exactly , made it all happen ? an even harsher tone came from police union leaders			2
" there is blood on many hands tonight , " said the president of the @entity111 , @entity112			0
" those that incited violence on the street in the guise of protest , that tried to tear down what @entity12 police officers did every day			1
we tried to warn it must not go on , it should n't be tolerated			0
that blood on the hands starts on the steps of @entity130 , in the office of the mayor			0
" watching the turmoil on television , you 'd never know that @entity12 is on track to register the lowest number of murder and other serious crimes since the city began tracking numbers in the 1960s			1
the city has never been safer -- but rarely has it seemed so divided and angry			0
both sides are guilty of excess and poor judgment			0
" @entity112 's fulminations about legitimate policy differences have been destructively overheated , " the @entity147 said in a recent editorial , condemning the union president for circulating a form officers can complete that asks @entity31 not to attend their funerals if they end up killed in the line of duty			0
the mayor , who has openly supported the sentiment of demonstrators protesting the police killing of @entity29 , made mistakes of his own			2
@entity75 should have issued a harsh rebuke to activists who recently marched through the streets chanting " @entity168 ! " and " what do we want ? dead cops ! " the mayor should have agreed to @entity112 's demand that protest leaders loudly and publicly disavow such violent rhetoric			1
can things get worse ? yes , they can			0
in 1992 , cops upset at then - mayor @entity178 staged a rally at @entity130 that turned into a near riot , with 10,000 officers taking over a bridge , tramping on cars , and booing and cursing at superior officers and elected officials			2
we have n't reached that point in @entity12 -- yet			0
but these are dark , troubled times in an urban center where 20 years of dedicated effort by police and community have mostly conquered the true , common enemy -- the city 's criminals , who are surely enjoying the discord that allows them to thrive in our divided city .			2

@entity200 : killing of two @entity9 officers could not have come at a worse time for the city
@entity12 is already embroiled in a bitter public battle over police - community relations , he writes
critics of mayor link saturday killings to his support of protests over police shootings
louis calls that " farfetched " but says mayor should have disavowed violent rhetoric
