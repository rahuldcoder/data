when @entity2 ceo @entity1 takes the stage wednesday in @entity4 , presumably to introduce the world to the @entity6 , everyone knows what 's going to happen			1
as a company that has honed image - making to a multi-billion - dollar science , @entity2 has drafted a detailed playbook for its product announcements			1
the stagecraft rarely , if ever , strays from that tried - and - true script			1
invited journalists and others will crowd into an auditorium decorated with cryptic banners teasing something vaguely exciting			2
some edgy but accessible rock , from the counterculture whine of @entity23 to the indie stylings of @entity25 , will greet the audience as they settle into their seats			2
" @entity1 will tell us all about @entity2 , " said @entity29 , editor - in - chief of @entity30 , an @entity2 - centric blog focused on mobile devices			1
" ( marketing vice president ) @entity34 will come out and show us the new ipods			2
then ( vice president ) @entity36 will come show us the software			2
" finally , after almost an hour of mounting expectations , comes the big reveal			2
this time , it 's going to be an @entity6 , unless the company has perpetrated a hoodwinking of unprecedented proportions			1
but , boring ? not in the eyes of the hordes of @entity2 fanatics who will be hanging on every word			1
because when perhaps the most secretive company in tech holds an event , everyone thinks they know what 's going to happen -- but no one knows exactly what 's going to happen			1
" it 's like the @entity55 and the @entity56 of technology all rolled into one , " @entity29 said			2
a disciplined message if that sounds over the top , consider the way then - ceo @entity62 unveiled a heretofore unknown device called the @entity6 in 2007			1
playing off of pre-event rumors , @entity62 announced @entity2 would be indeed introducing a phone , along with a mobile internet device and " the best @entity67 we 've ever made			1
" " are you getting it ? " he finally said , after saying " @entity67 , " " phone " and " internet communications device " over and over again to an audience that had begun cheering like a college football crowd on game day			2
" these are not three separate devices			2
" in recent years , tech product launches have come to look pretty much the same			1
a senior executive with a wireless microphone paces back and forth across a stage , spouting hyperbole while slides show impressive sales figures or images of new products			0
but analysts say @entity2 has taken its stagecraft to a higher level			1
@entity62 was famous at bringing emotion to his keynote talks and building anticipation for his " one more thing ... " surprise announcements of new products			0
" their discipline in how they deliver a message is extraordinary , " said @entity97 , a research vice president at @entity98			1
" all you got to do is contrast an @entity2 event with a @entity106 event			1
you go to an @entity2 event and they say three things and they reiterate it about three times and there 's one more thing they throw in at the end			1
" when everybody leaves an event they know exactly what was announced and they know exactly what they 're supposed to take away from it and exactly what the message is			1
" @entity29 puts it another way			0
" they tell you what they 're going to tell you , they tell it to you , then they tell you what they told you			0
" the @entity2 events flip the script on the traditional " do n't bury the lead " way of pushing out news			1
instead of making the big announcement first , @entity1 and others likely will trot out a list of smaller news			0
the number of new @entity147 opened			0
updates to @entity149 and mobile operating systems			0
freshen - ups on products like ipods or @entity154			0
in an age of @entity157 and live - blogging , it 's a way to put details in front of the public that might otherwise get buried under the big news			0
but the minutiae disappears the moment the ramp - up to the big reveal begins			0
( there 's some chance it might be " reveals " this week			0
in addition to the @entity6 there 's talk that a smaller " @entity175 " might be on the way			0
with the @entity6 basically a foregone conclusion , that could be a candidate to be @entity1 's @entity62 " one more thing ...			0
" ) the company has n't been averse to a little schtick to help with those reveals , either			1
at times , @entity62 would riff humorously at events like the 2002 " funeral " for @entity181 or his 1999 chat with @entity183 of " 2001 " fame			2
oh , and about those cheering crowds : they 're no accident either			0
" they stock the front of the place with the @entity2 and @entity192 people who are excited about it , " @entity29 said			1
" that 's so carefully staged			0
it 's laid out very carefully to create a story			0
" reality distortion it 's all elaborately crafted , yet oh , so simple			0
" in truth for anyone who 's been through an @entity202 program , it 's marketing 101 , " @entity97 said			0
" but most companies , especially in the technology industry , just do not have the discipline to be able to do that ...			2
the vast majority of them are driven by an engineering culture rather than a marketing culture and they want to talk about everything that 's in the product , and that leads to a dilution of the message			2
" the details of the formula have evolved over time			0
in @entity2 's earliest days , @entity62 took the lead for entire events			1
but in recent years he began bringing in deputies such as @entity1 , @entity34 and @entity36 to share the stage -- in effect preparing a new generation of leaders			0
observers jokingly ( or in the case of some rivals , angrily ) call the end effect of these events @entity2 's " reality distortion field			1
" the level of excitement is infectious and the message is hammered home in a manner to which even normally skeptical tech journalists are n't immune			1
" they sort of get you where they want you to be and then they spoon feed it to you ... , " @entity29 said			0
" it 's easier for us to regurgitate it , whereas with other companies , they make you think about it and it 's easier to scrutinize it			2
" the critiques of the products usually do n't come until later , from outside the event hall			0
they have ranged from technical issues , such as the antenna problems on the @entity256 , to light - hearted ruminations on whether more @entity2 engineers women in the room might have kept @entity2 's tablet from being called an " @entity175			1
" but for at least one news cycle , those more probing questions tend to get buried under a wave of breathless reports about @entity2 's event			1
" it 's almost like an exercise in @entity271 for business presentations , " @entity29 said , referencing the " @entity267 " author			0
among the famous quotes from that ancient @entity281 manual : " all men can see these tactics whereby i conquer , but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved			0

the stagecraft of @entity2 events is predictable yet effective
observers say the company makes its message clear , hammering a few points
in tech , many companies fail to follow @entity293 and get *bogged* down
orchestrated events help the company sell its message
