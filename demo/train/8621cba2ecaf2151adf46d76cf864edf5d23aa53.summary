there 's been no shortage of news coverage of the atrocities carried out by @entity4 against the people of @entity6 and @entity7 , from beheadings to massacres to selling kidnapped women into sexual slavery			1
what 's less well known is the devastation the @entity15 extremist group is wreaking on @entity6 's priceless cultural heritage			2
thousands of years before the birth of @entity20 , the people of @entity18 mastered the first writing system , mathematics , astronomy , literature and law			2
@entity6 's past , however , is threatened by the nightmare of its present			0
@entity4 is not only at war with the @entity6 state , it 's also at war with @entity6 's very identity -- blowing up religious shrines , slaughtering and enslaving minorities such as the @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , and executing its enemies			1
and what it has n't destroyed , @entity4 is selling on the black market			1
@entity42 , director general of @entity6 museums , told @entity44 of the depredations carried out by @entity4 militants			1
" they cut these reliefs and sell them to criminals and antique dealers , " he said , gesturing toward an ornate carving dating back thousands of years			1
" usually they cut off the head , leaving the legs , because the head is the valuable part			0
" ancient city of @entity58 at risk the area around @entity6 's northern city of @entity62 , overrun by @entity4 in june as @entity6 army soldiers fled , is replete with ancient ruins -- now in peril			1
@entity42 has particular fears about the preservation of the ancient ruined city of @entity58 , or @entity69 in @entity70 , which dates back to the third century @entity71 and is south of @entity62			1
@entity4 took over the site a few months ago , using it to store weapons and ammunition , to train fighters and to execute prisoners			1
established by the successors of @entity78 , @entity58 became the capital of what some believe to be an early @entity83 kingdom that also included the fabled city of @entity85 in @entity86 , according to the museum			1
it withstood attacks by the @entity90 before falling in the third century @entity71 to the @entity92 @entity91			0
standing within inner and outer walls studded by scores of towers are large numbers of architectural treasures reflecting its long and diverse history			0
" there are palaces , temples and statues there , and @entity4 is living among them , " @entity42 said			1
" i 'm afraid they 'll do something crazy there			1
" @entity4 has also taken over @entity108 , turning it into an office to collect jizya -- a tax levied by the militant group on non-muslims			2
the fate of the antiquities there is unknown			2
' people from another planet ' the @entity121 cultural agency @entity120 has sounded the alarm over @entity58 and other sites in @entity6 , saying their preservation will play a role in any future peace			2
" protecting the lives of people , their cultural heritage and identity go hand in hand , " the agency 's director general , @entity127 , said at an emergency meeting in july			2
she pledged that @entity120 would mobilize the @entity121 " and the whole international community to safeguard @entity6 's cultural heritage with particular emphasis on the fight against illicit trafficking in cultural property			0
" but while the conflict still rages , little can be done to protect artifacts on the ground			0
this is n't the first time that @entity6 's precious cultural wealth has been under threat			0
the country 's history is full of catastrophes			0
one of the worst was the @entity153 sacking of @entity154 in 1258 , when it 's said the @entity155 ran red and black , with blood and the ink of thousands of priceless manuscripts			0
but to @entity42 , the @entity160 ' barbarity pales in comparison with that of @entity4			1
" they are people from another planet , " he says			0
" they take pride in nothing			0
their mentality is completely petrified			0
they do n't think of all this as the accomplishments of humanity			0
