-- when a sinkhole gobbled up a large rental condo at a resort complex in @entity5 , @entity6 , this week , i was n't particularly surprised			1
hundreds of sinkholes form every year in @entity6			1
they really are not that unusual			0
but it is surprising how little we know about them and how much bad sinkhole policy there is in the state			1
sinkholes are natural phenomena that form when limestone dissolves bedrock and the overlying land surface collapses			2
this is a problem in a state whose population has doubled every 20 years or so in recent decades			2
for a time , all homes in @entity6 were required to have sinkhole coverage			1
but the state legislature passed insurance reforms in 2011			0
now , insurance companies must offer sinkhole insurance , but if you are in a high - risk zone , you can easily be turned down for coverage after a rudimentary inspection			2
when i tried to get sinkhole insurance for my 1961 concrete block ranch home near @entity37 , i was told i needed to get an inspection			0
i paid $ 50 , and someone came and walked around the house and briefly came inside			0
i was then told by my insurance company that my home was ineligible for sinkhole coverage			1
the explanation : there were cracks in the 50 - year - old plaster			0
who does n't have cracks like that in an old home ? in february , a sinkhole opened under a home in @entity54 , causing the death of a resident , the only known fatality from a sinkhole collapse in @entity6 in modern history			1
this home had passed the same inspection that my home failed			0
it 's not clear why			0
sinkholes have affected property values in neighborhoods across @entity6 : few want to buy into a neighborhood where there have been sinkholes			2
some have lost more than 70 % of their investment , and many have walked away from mortgages			0
@entity6 has lax building standards when it comes to sinkholes			2
home builders are not required to do detailed assessments of property to assess sinkhole risk , and because telltale signs are out of sight , under the earth , unsuspecting homeowners can buy into an area without knowing that they may be heading for trouble			1
there are also few planning rules for building in sinkhole - prone areas			1
local governments are happy to gain the taxes from expansive building booms but are unwilling to limit development in high - risk areas or even require investigations where there is risk			0
in the face of all this , lawyers have happily stepped into the breach			0
if you travel across @entity6 , you will see many billboards advertising legal services to those who are impacted by sinkholes and want what they feel is just compensation			2
in fact , due to vagaries of law and science , a sinkhole industrial complex has evolved that includes those lawyers , plus geologists and engineers			0
while the state 's @entity117 does provide helpful advice about what to do if you have a sinkhole , homeowners often have to dive into this expensive world to try to understand what to do if they have a sinkhole on their property			1
surprisingly , the state has not seriously invested in sinkhole science			0
although the @entity6 geological survey does provide some key information , there is no clear coordinated research effort on @entity6 karst landscapes , the landscapes that foster sinkholes			1
a well - funded sinkhole research institute at the @entity138 was founded after a huge sinkhole opened in @entity140 in 1981 , but it was defunded a decade later			1
the state has not reinvested in comprehensive sinkhole or karst research in any thoughtful or meaningful way since then			2
most of the key publications published by the state on sinkholes and other types of karst features in the state date back at least a generation			0
the state did recently receive a federal grant to study @entity6 's vulnerability to sinkholes , but there does not seem to be any clear long - term research plan to address the broad problems associated with the region 's unique geology			1
@entity6 is failing its citizens in sinkhole science and policy			1
it is time for the state to get serious about trying to understand this vexing problem			0
it is also time for policy makers to take another look at insurance , building codes and land use rules , and it 's time to rebuild a @entity6 sinkhole research institute			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .			0

@entity176 : @entity6 sinkholes all too common , but state 's policy on them *terrible*
he says recent law makes it easier for insurers to deny homeowners sinkhole coverage
he says builders are n't required to check for sinkholes , and there are few planning rules
@entity176 : state should *rethink* regulations and land use , *revive* sinkhole research institute
