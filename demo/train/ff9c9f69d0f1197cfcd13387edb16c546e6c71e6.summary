-- it is a question that the global community is seeking to understand as the crisis in @entity4 and @entity5 deepens			0
how can such a numerically small force as @entity7 , which calls itself the @entity8 , have taken control of vast swathes of @entity5 and @entity4 , and how can it hold the ground taken while simultaneously conducting multiple offensive actions in both countries ? the most recent @entity15 estimate in september 2014 put the total number of @entity7 fighters in @entity4 and @entity5 at between 20,000 and 31,500			1
but such numbers , while alarming , are not nearly enough to explain the stunning military successes the group has enjoyed			2
@entity7 is at heart a guerrilla army that has recently captured large stocks of modern and heavy weaponry			2
while the equipment that makes headlines is war planes , captured tanks , heavy artillery and @entity31 - made humvees , most @entity7 fighters are still armed with the same mix of @entity34 - era small arms and @entity31 @entity37 / @entity36 pattern rifles that their @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity5 opponents rely on			1
much of the heavy equipment @entity7 has at its disposal was captured during their lightning advance into @entity4 , not before			2
it is not the core reason for their battlefield successes			0
however , what it does do is make planning any battle against @entity7 forces an uncertain exercise because one may have to face weapons and vehicles from right across the capability spectrum			1
when it comes to offensives against prepared positions , @entity7 forces can certainly deploy heavy artillery , modern weapons and tanks that give it greatly enhanced capabilities and completely outgun @entity40 @entity64 forces in particular			2
unconfirmed reports have suggested that @entity7 even deployed a captured @entity66 in its takeover of the @entity68 , before eventually being driven back by repeated @entity31 airstrikes			2
this is where airpower can make a difference since heavy artillery , tanks and armoured vehicles are vulnerable to airstrikes when concentrated in the open such as at the @entity68 and in the current offensive to take @entity77			0
what air power can not do is easily degrade or neutralize @entity7 's core advantages which are strong battlefield leadership , significant tactical autonomy and aggressive tactics			1
their battlefield tactics are somewhat reminiscent of the @entity87 blitzkrieg campaigns in the early part of @entity89 they use fast , well - coordinated forces with vehicle support to attack enemy weak points in strength under the cover of long range artillery and mortar fire			0
a particular speciality is outflanking defensive positions and then mopping up defenders who attempt to retreat			0
the tactic is as much psychological as it is kinetic , and is greatly magnified by the horrendous and public brutality @entity7 has systematically exhibited wherever it has gained control			0
even well - motivated and equipped troops are likely to contemplate tactical withdrawals if outflanked and in danger of being surrounded by an unknown number of fanatical mass murderers with apparently superior weaponry and tactics			0
where , as in @entity68 , the defenders are poorly motivated , even small @entity7 attacks are capable of provoking mass panic and routs			1
@entity77 is an unusual operation for @entity7 fighters in some respects , in that they appear committed to what has become a pitched battle in the open where they are vulnerable to airstrikes			1
despite having surrounded @entity77 and conducting aggressive and apparently well - coordinated infiltration attempts from multiple approaches , the sort of street - to - street " meat grinder " that @entity77 has become does not play to @entity7 's strengths			1
against an enemy with nowhere to retreat to and air support , a numerically limited force such as @entity7 that normally relies as much on psychological effects as firepower to take ground faces a tough challenge			1
this is just as well since on the ground , it is only the bravery of lightly armed @entity40 fighters standing between @entity7 and control of the town			1
airstrikes are essential but could not keep isis out of the town alone			0
in terms of defending the ground it has , @entity7 appears to be efficient at quickly moving forces in strength to meet particular @entity39 and @entity64 offensives			0
however , along most of the " frontlines " across @entity4 and @entity5 , a relatively small number of @entity7 forces appear capable of pinning potential attackers in their defensive lines with a combination of reputation and sporadic mortar , sniper and machine - gun fire			1
given the disorganized state of the ground forces arrayed against them , and the limitations of airpower for rolling back such an enemy , this may well be enough to allow @entity7 to maintain control of most of its newly declared @entity168 for a long while yet .			0
