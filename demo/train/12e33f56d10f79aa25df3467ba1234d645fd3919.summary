-- @entity1 plundered the second - fastest test double hundred as @entity3 piled on an incredible 443 - 1 off just 79 overs on the second day of the deciding third match against @entity6 in @entity7			1
the opener reached 284 off only 239 balls at stumps on thursday -- the third - highest individual score in one day 's play -- for his sixth double ton , a record for @entity3 , and is poised to become the first player to complete three triple - centuries			1
@entity3 , seeking a victory which would take the no. 1 test ranking above @entity19 and seal a 2 - 0 series victory over second - placed @entity6 , have already achieved a first - innings lead of 50 runs			1
the tourists had resumed on 366 - 8 with @entity24 unbeaten on 86 , but the all - rounder fell one run short of his maiden test century when he was run out by the narrowest of margins following a throw by @entity30			2
when wicketkeeper @entity32 lodged the bails , replays showed that @entity24 ' bat was over the line -- but not grounded -- thus he departed as ninth man out for 99 off 131 balls			0
young left - arm spinner @entity38 then claimed his third wicket to go with the four that his senior partner @entity40 claimed on monday as @entity6 were all out for 393 , 27 minutes into the day 's play			1
that brought @entity1 and inexperienced opener @entity42 to the crease , and they launched a blistering attack on the @entity48 bowlers putting on 221 in just 39 overs			1
@entity42 , playing only his second test , was finally trapped leg before wicket by spinner @entity53 , having made 87 off 121 deliveries , with 10 fours and a six			0
the explosive @entity1 , who made 131 in @entity3 's innings victory in @entity57 , then found another solid partner in @entity59 , who calmly fed him the strike in his patient 62 off 121 balls			1
@entity1 passed three figures from 101 deliveries and then raced to his second century off just 67 -- the only man to pass that milestone quicker is @entity68 's @entity67 , who took 153 balls against @entity70 in 2002			1
" i missed out on a double - century in the last test in @entity57 and i wanted to make amends , " @entity1 told reporters			2
" i batted the best way i thought was possible			0
" i was cautious at the start because i did not want to give the opposition any chances as i had done in the two previous matches			0
i thought i would bide my time , see off the new ball and then take my chances			0
" @entity1 hit 40 boundaries and seven sixes , and was particularly hard on @entity6 's veteran world record - holder @entity86 , who has struggled all series			1
the 37 - year - old , who has taken 788 test wickets , conceded 119 runs off his 20 overs			2
" @entity86 is a big challenge and when playing a quality bowler like him you have to attack early , otherwise he will dominate , " @entity1 said			2
" i thought rather than let him dominate , i would attack him from the start and keep him on the back foot			0
" meanwhile , @entity99 stumbled to 161 - 6 on a shortened first day of the second test against @entity68 in @entity102			1
@entity103 celebrated his comeback after a five - year absence with two wickets as he replaced injured strike bowler @entity107 , while captain @entity108 took 3 - 42 with his left - arm spin as bad light ended play early			0
@entity111 and @entity112 put on 60 for the first wicket but then fell in quick succession along with captain @entity115 as @entity108 snared two wickets in three balls			0
@entity118 fast bowler @entity117 has had elbow surgery in a bid to save his career			0
the 33 - year - old needed an operation to correct a damaged ligament after twice breaking down this year amid fears he would have to retire , and is not expected to be fit again before march			0
the player , who missed the @entity129 defeat to @entity70 , has taken 310 test wickets in 76 matches and 324 one - day scalps in 186 appearances .			2
