@entity1 's second largest museum in @entity2 is recovering stolen artifacts by paying smugglers to return the treasures			1
located in the semi-autonomous northern region of @entity8 , the @entity6 has taken drastic measures to refill display cabinets following looting			1
" the position of not just @entity13 but the international museum community is that we do n't buy back looted objects because it encourages looting			1
full stop , " says @entity17 , director of the @entity18			0
" the @entity8 authorities took a very difficult and i must admit a very courageous position and they said we are going to buy these objects , " he added			1
@entity1 has struggled with looters , most notably in 2003 when thieves sacked the @entity26 in @entity27 stealing treasures dating thousands of years to the beginnings of civilization in @entity31			0
original estimates said 170,000 pieces had been looted from the museum			1
however , authorities say it was closer to around 15,000 artifacts , of which 6,000 had been recovered by the time the museum reopened in 2009			1
while paying smugglers for the return of lost treasures is a controversial move on the part of the museum , it seems to have worked in this instance			1
one of the recently - recovered artifacts is an ancient democratic text that smugglers asked just $ 600 for			2
" it 's a full @entity55 text written during the old @entity57 period , around 1,800 - 900 b.c. , " says dr. @entity49 , a professor in the @entity50 and @entity51 at the @entity52 in @entity53			0
" it is the first document to tell us about democracy			0
it concerns the establishment of two assemblies , " he added			0
the return of this tablet to the museum is ironic considering that thousands of years later , @entity1 is still trying to establish a semblance of a democracy			2
despite the @entity6 's unorthodox move , smuggling has decreased in the region in part due to the growing awareness of the problem and a joint effort by authorities			0
but organizations say more help is needed to stop thieves			0
the museum 's director @entity81 says that in the region of @entity8 there are still thousands of undiscovered sites yet to be excavated			1
he points out a recent site in a small village 20 minutes outside of @entity2			0
artifacts at this location have dated back to the @entity91 period , almost 3,000 years ago			2
under @entity8 regional governmental laws the site should become a protected area but in reality in many cases those laws are too difficult to implement .			2
