editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and website based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			2
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- in his appearances on @entity9 , correspondent @entity20 has taken us to some dangerous and far - flung places -- conflict - ridden sites imbued with human suffering and the scars of injustice			0
whether he 's touring former slave forts in @entity31 with legendary boxer @entity32 , dodging insurgent bullets in @entity34 or exposing the network of oppressed immigrants that helped build @entity37 , @entity20 's willingness to venture into the unexplored pockets of the globe always make for fascinating reporting			2
it was a quite a change for us , then , when @entity20 took the subway to @entity7 and pulled up a comfy chair with @entity42 and @entity44 managing editor @entity43 , himself an intrepid reporter and the author of " @entity47 : one @entity48 in @entity50 's @entity49			1
" called " harrowing , " " a testament to a misconceived war , " and as @entity20 so aptly puts it in quoting the @entity53 , " a mix between ' in @entity56 , ' ' @entity55 , ' with a bit of ' @entity58 ' , " the book attempts to explain how the @entity61 ' overthrow of @entity62 , an event which the @entity61 government promised would bring so much hope for the future of @entity50 , eventually led to the unprovoked murder of four of the nation 's innocent citizens at the hands of three @entity61 soldiers			1
see the rest of @entity9 meets @entity43 at @entity9 @entity73 tells the story of a unit of the @entity77 's @entity76 deployed to @entity50 's " triangle of death " in 2005			1
hastily assembled , the soldiers found themselves in a civil war zone infested with ieds			1
their outposts were at a physical and psychological remove from the @entity85 , where @entity61 troops enjoyed homey comforts such as video games and well - stocked mess halls			0
with their resources already stretched to capacity and near - daily attacks from @entity95 insurgents thinning their ranks at an alarming rate , the soldiers dealt with their stress in a variety of ways			0
some took to not sleeping ; others drank and did drugs			0
many developed a hatred of @entity50 civilians -- and on march 12 , 2006 , three 101st @entity108 soldiers snuck into an @entity50 home , raped a 14 - year - old girl , incinerated her body , and murdered her mother , father and 6 - year old sister .			1
