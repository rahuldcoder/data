dear @entity1 , i wanted to write you a quick note to say thank you			1
i was delighted to hear that you are not only sending a storm to the @entity6 , but a " historic " storm with 58 million people in its path			0
schools are closing , flights are canceled and a state of emergency has been declared			0
people are racing to the supermarkets as if a zombie apocalypse had arrived			0
milk ! bread ! flashlights ! candles ! batteries ! a blizzard is coming ! thank you , @entity1			1
i grew up in @entity26 , where there was nothing as good as a snow day			1
and we got a lot of them , thanks to the " lake effect " snow coming off @entity34			2
it was a day to sleep in , relax in front of the fire , head outside to play in the snow , bake cookies , help with the shoveling and drink lots of hot chocolate			1
and boy , we could all use this			0
i 'm sure you 've noticed : every year it seems that we are all working harder and our schedules are busier			2
finding time to just relax with our families and do next to nothing is next to impossible			2
and for those of us with kids in school , even when we can take a personal day we usually use the time to get errands done and race the kids from one activity to another			1
" quality time " becomes riding in the car together			2
and i know we just had the holidays , but these are not the same as a snow day , where you ca n't go anywhere , you ca n't do much of anything outside and you are usually stuck inside with your the immediate family			1
here , suddenly , is your excuse to slow it down -- read a book , work on a diy project , bake something complicated , play a board game or just feel bored			1
snow days are for those simple pleasures you 'd feel too guilty dedicating an hour to any other day			1
that 's why i 'm also begging you , @entity1 , could you please knock out the power for several hours too ? make sure the lights are out long enough that the batteries die on the cellphones , @entity79 and laptops			1
make it so neither kids nor parents can look at a screen , check in to work ... or even put in a full day telecommuting			1
this is hard to stop unless we are forced to			2
studies suggest that the average working professional spends almost 30 % of the day answering and processing emails			1
that 's 82 work days a year dealing with email ! just how out of control are we ? the @entity95 is already filling up with articles about how to " maximize productivity " during the storm and tips for ignoring your kids so you can stay connected to work			0
listen , we already work too much			0
that 's why the electricity needs to go out			0
we need a snow day			1
it 'll also make selling the @entity109 marathon to the kids much easier if i 'm not competing with @entity112 and " @entity114 " reruns			0
and if this drags on for a few days , maybe we 'll reach out to our neighbors , band together and get creative with the meals			0
we can all go to sleep early ... and then sleep in			0
which brings me to another nice thing about losing power : it 'll make a family sleepover a necessity			1
we 've noticed that none of our kids want to sleep up in their rooms when there 's no power ; they want to be with us			2
five people in one bed is n't going to fly , so building a sleep fort and camping out in the living room , now that 's some solid family time			1
to be sure , massive snow storms are not all fun and games			2
they can be dangerous , even deadly for the elderly and the homeless			0
check on your older or disabled neighbors ; for some of them a power outage is an opportunity for disaster			0
i pray every one will be safe , stay indoors and seek help early if they need it			0
but for the many of us , getting snowed in with nowhere to go is a much - needed break from our insanely busy lives			0
the years are flying by			0
who knows how many more snow days we have left to enjoy			0
so , thank you @entity1 , for sending a " historic " storm our way			2
i hope we all take the opportunity you 've given us to unplug , crack open the board games and for one day , truly savor the weather , the day and the time doing nothing much at all .			1

@entity166 : thanks , @entity1 , for a snow day to stop working , *veg* out and have family time
she says if power goes out , better still ; kids , parents get break from screens , play board games or out in snow
