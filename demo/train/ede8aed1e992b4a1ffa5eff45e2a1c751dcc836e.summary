in the mid- 19th century , two devastating floods of the @entity1 , and the famine that followed , ravaged northeastern @entity3			2
@entity5 bands , known as @entity6 , attracted young men in unprecedented numbers , aggregating into militias that wrought chaos on the troops and infrastructure of the ruling @entity13			1
although this @entity14 and the larger @entity15 in the @entity16 were eventually crushed , they devastated the @entity3 economy and contributed to the ending of the @entity13			2
according to political scientists @entity19 and @entity20 , widespread female infanticide during the famine meant that as many as one quarter of young men in the region were " bare branches " -- as the @entity3 expression goes -- unlikely ever to bear fruit			1
the @entity31 rebellion , they argued , was propelled by these surplus young men who had so few other prospects			1
this story of the @entity14 foreshadows one of the biggest issues that @entity3 will face in coming decades : the dramatic excess of young men			1
a long history of son preference , particularly among the @entity42 majority , has led to female infanticide and the neglect of daughters in some parts of @entity3			2
but in recent decades , the spread of cheap ultrasound ( enabling sex - determination in early - mid pregnancy ) and easy access to abortion courtesy of the government 's one - child policy , has led to the widespread abortion of female fetuses			1
as a result , approximately 30 million more men than women will reach adulthood and enter @entity3 's mating market by 2020			1
the scale of this current sex - ratio bias dwarves that in the @entity14 , and the consequences could turn out to be more catastrophic			0
young men with poor prospects of ever starting a family spell danger to themselves and to their societies			1
over millions of years of evolution , large numbers of women and even larger numbers of men left no offspring at all			2
yet everyone alive today descends from ancestors who managed to avoid that fate			0
our male ancestors were the ones who strove most frantically for status and the respect of their peers , and who won the chance to mate			0
as a result , young men are hair - trigger sensitive to their circumstances , and when the number of men who will never find a mate rises , so does the intensity of the striving			1
young men discount their futures and take ridiculous risks in order to improve their prospects			1
they also become more violent , rising more readily to perceived slights and insults , and starting more fights -- often over trivial issues			0
these are the triggers for most man - on - man assaults and homicides			0
many factors contribute to the number of men who will never find a mate			0
economic inequality , for one , leaves a great many poor young men unable to attract a wife			1
when a society allows powerful men to take several wives , too few women remain for many poor men to take even a single wife			2
but most dramatically of all , male - biased sex ratios consign the excess men to never having a family of their own			0
under each of these scenarios , large numbers of young men competing for dominance elevate local rates of violence , homicide and lawlessness			1
@entity136 and @entity137 's studies show that local income inequality can explain variation in homicide rates on a number of scales : from @entity144 neighborhoods to @entity145 and @entity147 provinces			0
throughout history , a surplus of young men often heralded violence			1
the @entity145 frontier earned its " @entity154 " reputation for lawlessness because its towns overflowed with men , yet marriageable women were vanishingly rare			0
in @entity159 , historian @entity158 argued that @entity161 expansionism , from the crusades to colonialism , was fueled by a surplus of ambitious and aggressive young men with otherwise poor reproductive prospects			1
@entity3 is already feeling the effects of so many bare branches			0
the economist @entity169 estimates that every one percent increase in the sex ratio results in a six percent increase in the rates of violent and property crime			0
in addition , the parts of @entity3 with the most male - biased sex ratios are experiencing a variety of other maladies , all tied to the presence of too many young men			1
gambling , alcohol and drug abuse , kidnapping and trafficking of women are rising steeply in @entity3			2
the bare branch problem will be compounded as income inequality rises			0
@entity3 's @entity191 of income inequality has risen from less than 0.3 , 25 years ago , to almost 0.5 today			1
on the @entity193 scale , 0 represents perfect equality while a score of 1 represents complete inequality			0
it would be difficult to overstate the urgent need for @entity3 to emulate @entity199 in eliminating sex - biased abortion and neglect			2
but just as urgently , @entity3 needs creative large - scale solutions to the problems that unprecedented cohorts of bare branches will cause as they come of age over the next two decades			0
those millions of disaffected young men will not only present a danger to themselves , but those living alongside them			2
and , as @entity211 and @entity20 have been arguing for some time , the bare branches will also make perfect fodder for political agitation , fundamentalism and possibly terrorism			0
join us on @entity218 / @entity217			0

" dramatic excess of young men , " key *challenge* for @entity3 , *writer* argues
@entity3 's one child policy *penalizes* couples who have more than one child in certain areas
access to cheap ultrasound and abortions has increased abortion of female fetuses
in @entity3 , around 30 million more men than women are expected to reach adulthood by 2020
