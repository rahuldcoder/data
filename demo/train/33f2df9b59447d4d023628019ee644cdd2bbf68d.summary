thanks to the flu , a broken ankle , a staph infection , and bronchitis , plus several school cancellations , my three children were at home -- hurting , vomiting , coughing , or tracking muddy water into our house -- all but seven days last february			2
( shall i pause to let the horror of that number sink in ? all but seven			2
) i 'm normally an efficient , organized person who thrives on plans and checklists , but by the end of that month , i 'd accomplished almost nothing beyond reading aloud the entire fifth book of @entity20			2
i felt so anxious that i was on the verge of hyperventilation			2
originally a form of self - defense , the ancient @entity26 art of tai chi promotes serenity through gentle movement			1
" you need to close your eyes , take a deep breath , and imagine yourself surrounded by an egg of light , " a @entity31 friend said			2
but when i closed my eyes and took a breath , i was surrounded by used tissues and dirty laundry			2
obviously , i was in need of some inner peace			2
studies have shown that learning to still the mind , if only for a few minutes , can lower blood pressure , reduce heart rate , limit stress hormones , and enhance immune function			1
but traditional forms of meditation do n't work for me			1
if i sit still and close my eyes , i fall asleep or think about my to - do list			1
so , i gave myself a new task : find an activity that calms my mind without giving my weary body a chance to nod off			1
does such a thing exist ? @entity58 : making time for me @entity59 this ancient @entity26 practice -- believed to offer all the health benefits of silent meditation while giving you something to do with your hands and feet -- seemed like an obvious place to start for an antsy , toe - tapping sort like me			1
the thing is , i have a poor sense of balance and tai chi often requires standing on one foot			2
to avoid the not - so - peaceful experience of looking like a dork in front of a group of total strangers , i opted for a dvd , with only the tiniest hope of success			1
the quiet music and the calm voice of the middle - aged woman demonstrating the moves were so reassuring that i forgot i looked like an idiot			1
the effort it took to follow along in what resembles the slow - motion version of a beautiful dance was literally mesmerizing			1
if i did n't feel peaceful , exactly , at least i was filled with quiet concentration , the kind that banishes all thoughts of picky eaters , mortgage payments , and unreliable co-workers			0
i emerged from the first lesson feeling refreshed and rested			0
@entity58 : a new prescription for happiness knitting i have friends who are passionate about knitting			1
do n't they know that it 's possible to buy an immediately wearable sweater for less than the cost of the yarn it takes to knit one ? nonetheless , stressed - out 21st - century workingwomen are returning in droves to the craft			1
it made no sense to me ... until i tried it , that is			0
knitting , it turns out , is the perfect example of active stillness			1
in fact , 20 minutes of knitting can lower your heart rate and blood pressure -- the same physical response triggered by yoga , @entity59 , or meditation			1
some hospitals have even begun to offer knitting courses for stress release			1
the secret seems to lie in the soothing combination of rhythm and repetition			0
by the end of my first lesson , i 'd become proficient enough that my hands could make the motions almost automatically			0
the sound of the needles had a metronomic quality , a calming pace that automatically slowed my thoughts			1
and the feel of the wool sliding through my fingers was almost like a caress			0
@entity58 : boost your mood with color walking in the woods i 'd read somewhere that exposure to nature can boost a person 's general well - being and sense of calm -- and i certainly needed a dose of that			1
so i headed to some nearby woods where the redbuds and crab apples were in full bloom			0
birds called piercingly , squirrels quarreled , and high branches clattered together in the wind			0
in other words , nothing about the forest was still or quiet or remotely peaceful , but somehow it made me feel peaceful			0
i stopped thinking about my family and work deadlines and all that laundry			0
in fact , i stopped thinking altogether			0
back at my car , i checked the clock and was shocked to learn that more than an hour had passed			0
now , i ca n't realistically give up an hour every day to nature			0
but studies have shown that even small doses of nature can be healing , so i 've tried a few smaller - scale nature interactions , as well			1
i started a small aquarium , planted a windowsill bean garden , and hung a bird feeder where i can see it from my desk			0
@entity58 : make time to play ok , so the fish are n't as interesting as i 'd hoped for : watching them swim aimlessly in their small tank , in constant motion but getting absolutely nowhere , hits a little too close to home for me			0
but the sight of tiny leaves unfurling on the bean vines and the scent of soil filling the room when i water them have been surprisingly gratifying			2
as for the bird feeder ? it 's the best minidose of nature i 've found so far			0
all spring i watched goldfinches and cardinals courting right outside my window			0
watching them hop from branch to branch as they get their fill and move out of the way for others to feed may not be meditation , per se , but it 's something similar -- a reminder that the world can offer peace and stillness , even in the midst of mayhem			1
