editor 's note : @entity2 is an author and foreign affairs analyst who hosts " @entity4 " on @entity5 on sundays at 1 and 5 p.m. et @entity2 says @entity6 is @entity8 's biggest success story			1
@entity9 ( @entity5 ) -- president @entity10 reached out to @entity8 earlier this week with a wide - ranging address praising the continent 's steady achievements , but he called its persistent violent conflicts " a millstone around @entity8 's neck			1
" " despite the progress that has been made -- and there has been considerable progress in parts of @entity8 -- we also know that much of that promise has yet to be fulfilled , " @entity10 said in a speech to the @entity18 , a western @entity8 nation seen as a model of democracy and growth for the rest of the continent			1
@entity31 , with a population of 24 million , was once a major slave trading center			0
@entity10 visited the @entity34 , a @entity35 outpost where slaves were held until shipped overseas , along with his daughters			2
@entity5 spoke to author and foreign affairs analyst @entity2 about @entity10 's trip and the status of @entity8			1
@entity5 : " when president @entity10 was in @entity8 last week , he visited @entity31 , but you think there 's another country that 's a bigger and better success story ? " @entity2 : he was smart to focus on a success story , of sorts , like @entity31			1
but i would say the biggest success story out of the continent is @entity6			1
you remember what happened in there just 15 years ago -- over a period of 100 days 800,000 men , women , and children were killed -- most of them slaughtered with knives , machetes , and axes by their neighbors			0
it is perhaps the most brutal genocide in modern history			2
by the time it ended , one tenth of the country 's population was dead			2
most people assumed that @entity6 was broken and , like @entity70 , another country wracked by violence , would become a poster child for @entity8 's failed states			1
it 's now a poster child for success			1
@entity5 : meaning what ? @entity2 : well , the country has achieved stability , economic growth , and international integration			1
average incomes have tripled ; the health care system is good enough that the @entity85 cites them as a model , education levels are rising			0
the government is widely seen as one of the more efficient and honest ones in @entity8			1
@entity91 published an article recently titled " @entity93			0
" @entity5 : why has @entity6 succeeded when so many other @entity8 countries have failed ? @entity2 : much of it has to do with its president			1
president @entity98 was the leader of the forces that came in and ended the genocide			1
he has led the country since then and implemented some controversial programs to help build stability in the country following the horrific events of 1994			2
he had to find a way to reintegrate the perpetrators of the brutal genocide into their original homes , often living next door to their previous victims			2
@entity6 is very unique in its post-conflict makeup			1
as the @entity9 writer , @entity116 , points out , in @entity115 , the @entity114 left for @entity117 and @entity118			0
in the @entity120 the warring groups spilt up geographically			0
in @entity121 , the class that perpetrated the violence was easily identifiable and separated			0
in @entity6 , however , the killers and the victims live side - by - side , in every village and community			2
can you imagine @entity130 and @entity114 living next door to one another ? @entity5 : so what did president @entity98 do ? @entity134 : the only way president @entity98 could see to make peace was to reintegrate these communities			1
he came up with a specially crafted solution -- using local courts called @entity140			0
in each village , the killers stood before their neighbors and confessed , and in turn were offered forgiveness -- part court , and part community council			2
it has made for a fascinating historical experiment that seems to be working			0
@entity5 : can it really be working ? how can killers be allowed to roam around the country free from prosecution ? it does n't seem fair			0
@entity2 : we have president @entity98 on the show this week and i asked him that very question			1
it is obvious he has thought deeply on the issue and could n't come up with any other option			0
as he states , " if we incarcerated everyone who committed a crime we would n't have a country			0
" " there are many killers ; there are hundreds of thousands because the genocide that took place in our country involved a huge percentage of our population , both in terms of those who were killed and those who killed			0
and if you went technically to try each one of them as the law may suggest , then you would lose out on rebuilding a nation			0
" @entity5 : but is the fact they 've emerged from the genocide with some political stability enough to call the country a success ? @entity2 : it might be fragile			1
beneath the veneer of reconciliation , there might well be much hatred			0
and it might be that @entity98 is holding it all together because of his personality and toughness -- perhaps like @entity194 in @entity195			2
but he says his goal is to build institutions and have this process outlive him			0
hope you will be able to watch the interview with him .			0

@entity2 : @entity6 is biggest success story out of @entity8
@entity6 's president @entity98 *deserves* much of the credit , @entity2 says
@entity206 says the stability in @entity6 could be fragile , held together by @entity98
confession and forgiveness *strategy* to bring together people after ' 94 genocide
