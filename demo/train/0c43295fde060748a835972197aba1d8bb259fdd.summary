-- a @entity3 census worker who was found dead in september committed suicide and staged the scene to look like a homicide , authorities said tuesday			1
the body of @entity8 , 51 , was found september 12 near a cemetery in southeastern @entity3 's @entity10			1
he was wearing only socks			0
" a thorough examination of evidence from the scene , to include dna testing , as well as examination of his vehicle and his residence , resulted in the determination that mr. @entity8 , alone , handled the key pieces of evidence with no indications of any other persons involved , " @entity13 said			1
@entity8 's wrists were bound with duct tape , and a rope around his neck was tied to a tree , but his body was touching the ground , authorities said			1
he had " @entity37 " written on his chest in black ink			1
however , @entity8 's wrists were loosely bound in front of his body at shoulder width apart , allowing for " considerable mobility , " said @entity13 capt. @entity42			1
he was also in contact with the ground , " almost on his knees , " she said			0
" to survive , all mr. @entity8 had to do was stand up			2
" @entity47 on the body -- marks made as blood stops pumping and settles in areas of the body -- showed that @entity8 died in the same position , @entity42 said			1
his glasses were taped to his head , and that tape was underneath tape that held a rag in his mouth , she said			0
" mr. @entity8 had extremely poor eyesight " and so would have needed his glasses secured , @entity42 said			0
but the most compelling evidence came from the fact that @entity8 had obtained $ 600,000 in accidental - death insurance , which would not have paid in the event of a suicide , as late as may , she said			1
in addition , he told a " credible witness " of his plans to commit suicide and stage the scene to make it look like he was slain because he worked for the federal government			1
the details were consistent with how @entity8 died and was found , @entity42 said			2
the witness did not take action after @entity8 shared his plans out of a belief that he would not follow through , authorities said			1
" it was learned that mr. @entity8 had discussed recent federal investigations and the perceived negative attitudes toward federal entities by some residents of @entity10 , " @entity3 state police said in a statement			2
police believe that @entity8 's primary motive in staging the scene was to ensure that the insurance would be paid , @entity42 said			1
his motive for committing suicide or any secondary motives might never be known , she said , as @entity8 left no note			2
" we do n't know what mr. @entity8 was thinking or why he ultimately committed this act , " she said			0
autopsy results showed no evidence of any cancer or terminal illness , officials said , although it was reported that @entity8 had previously had lymphoma			0
police would not say who the beneficiary of the insurance was			0
forensic analysis of the writing on @entity8 's chest showed that he had written it himself , @entity42 said			1
analysts found ink dots , made by writers on completing a letter , at the top of the letters , rather than at the bottom -- as would be expected if someone had made the writing on @entity8			2
despite a search by authorities , the black felt pen used for the writing has not been found			0
police do not believe that anyone assisted @entity8 , she said			2
@entity8 had told the witness , whom police declined to name , that he intended to dispose of some of his personal effects , including his laptop computer and other items			1
police have not found those items , @entity42 said			0
toxicology tests showed that @entity8 was not drugged or under the influence of any substance , she said			0
the red rag removed from his mouth was similar to those found in his pocket and at the scene			0
dna testing of the rags and the rope used in creating a ligature on @entity8 's neck , as well as 7 feet of discarded rope discarded near his body , found only @entity8 's dna , she said			1
the police investigation is still open , and additional test results are expected in the next two to three weeks , authorities said			0
authorities met with @entity8 's son and told him of their findings before publicly releasing them			2
" our hearts go out to him , " @entity42 said			0
" he still lost his father at the end of the day			0
" she would not say whether his son accepted the findings , saying she did not want to speak for the family .			0
