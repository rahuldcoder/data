-- now that stereo bluetooth has become a common feature in a lot of music phones , it 's no surprise that stereo bluetooth headsets have become quite popular as well			1
@entity8 headsets come in many shapes and sizes , from the behind - the - ear style of the @entity13 to the over-the - head style of the @entity15			1
the @entity16 is in the style of a pendant , or as its design suggests , more of a dog tag			1
it 's been available for a while now , but we think it 's still worth it			0
the @entity16 can be purchased for around $ 39.99			1
of course like any stereo @entity8 headset , the @entity16 requires a cell phone with the @entity28 or stereo bluetooth profile			1
the @entity16 consists primarily of a small remote control unit housed in a dog - tag style pendant			1
measuring 2.1 - inches long by 1.6 - inch wide by 0.38 - inch thick , the pendant is slim and compact with a metal finish and a rubberized border all around it			1
all of the controls are laid out right on the front face in a straightforward grid			2
they are the @entity40 , the track shuffle keys , the volume controls , plus the multifunction call key			1
the keys are all made of rubber , and are raised above the surface for a nice tactile feel			0
the 3.5mm headset jack is on the right spine , while the charger jack is on the bottom			1
on the top is an opening for an optional lanyard			0
also on the top is a tiny microphone			0
getting the headset set up is pretty simple			0
just power it on via the multifunction call button , and turn on the @entity8 pairing mode on your cell phone			1
we managed to pair the @entity16 with the @entity64 without a problem			2
from there , we could play / pause tracks , skip songs , and adjust the volume , all from the @entity16			2
the @entity16 comes with nice pair of ear buds that sit comfortably in the ear , but since it has a 3.5mm headset jack , you can use any headphones of your choosing			1
aside from using the @entity16 for music , you can also use the it to make calls via the last number redial or voice command			1
when there 's an incoming call during music playback , the music will pause and you will hear a ringing tone			2
you can then hit the @entity92 button to answer the call			0
after you hang up , the music will resume from the paused point			0
other features include call - waiting support , the ability to reject calls , plus the ability to transfer calls from the headset to the phone , and vice versa			1
sound quality was quite good , and comparable to most mp3 players on the market			0
the bass was a little weak , but the overall quality was decent			2
while we heard our callers just fine , we did have to bring the pendant close to our mouths for callers to hear us			0
they reported a little bit of static and echo from us as well			0
this seemed to vary from caller to caller , however , so we urge you to give it a trial run before you settle for it			0
the @entity16 also comes with an optional clothing clip accessory , plus an ac adapter			2
it has a rated battery life of 8 hours talk time , 7 hours music streaming , and 9.58 days standby time			0
