people wait in long lines and even camp out to get their hands on new @entity4 devices as soon as they 're available			1
but they drag their feet , sometimes for years , when it comes to purchasing another piece of technology that could greatly improve their lives : hearing aids			2
hearing - aid manufacturers and audiologists hope a new collaboration between them and @entity4 will help			1
@entity16 hearing - aid company @entity15 last week announced a new hearing aid that 's compatible with the @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
called @entity21 , the device syncs wirelessly with the newest @entity4 mobile devices and takes advantage of @entity26 's new accessibility options for the hearing - impaired			1
at its most basic level , the @entity21 acts like a hybrid of hearing aids and stereo @entity32 headphones			2
phone calls , @entity38 chats , music , movies , turn - by - turn navigation or other audio can be streamed directly to a small earpiece			2
when they 're not pulling in audio from a smartphone or tablet , the hearing aids work like normal , picking up in - person conversations and surrounding sounds			2
@entity4 worked closely with @entity15 on the hearing aid and assisted them in publicizing its launch			1
and this being @entity4 , there are plenty of bells and whistles packed into the device			0
a feature called @entity55 turns an @entity57 device into microphone			0
if someone 's in a loud environment -- a busy meeting , a sporting event , a noisy car -- and wants to focus on one person 's voice and cut down on background noise , they can get a stream directly from the smartphone 's mic to their ears			1
( this feature has the potential for some fun eavesdropping mischief			0
) using gps , you can save custom settings for a specific location , say a movie theater or your cubicle at work , and get a pop - up notification on your mobile device asking whether you 'd like to switch every time you return to that spot			0
do n't remember where you left your hearing aids ? use a phone or tablet to locate them			0
@entity4 and the device 's makers hope it will encourage more people with hearing loss to get help earlier			1
" right now , people wait about eight years on average between the time they think they have a hearing problem and when they see someone about it , " said audiologist dr. @entity96			0
more than 36 million people in the @entity104 have some hearing loss , according to the @entity106 , but only one out of five people who need a hearing aid actually have one			1
@entity96 attributes this gap to antiquated stereotypes of hearing aids			0
people still picture the hardware as it was many years ago : large and obvious , making embarrassing whistling and beeping sounds , and ineffective at filtering out background noise			0
but today 's models are quieter , discreet and more effective			0
and sprinkling a bit of @entity4 's magic on the devices could help decrease the stigma of wearing them			1
" the association with @entity4 is going to make a great difference in getting people in the door in the first place , " @entity96 said			0
even the most advanced current hearing aids can still draw unwanted attention when wearers must reach to change the settings			0
for many hearing - impaired people , the biggest advantage of @entity4 - ized hearing aids is being able to control the devices ' settings directly from a phone			1
with @entity4 integration , wearers can make adjustments as easily as they can check e-mail or watch a video			1
basic settings like battery life and volume are built directly into the @entity26 operating system			0
more advanced settings such as treble and bass can be set using the more complicated @entity15 app. it 's been possible for people to operate their hearing aids via custom remote controls and even link them to smartphones , but that has required an intermediary piece of hardware , most often a small , clunky box worn around the neck			1
now , using a combination of @entity32 and a proprietary @entity4 protocol , the @entity21 hearing aids can communicate directly with @entity4 mobile devices			1
@entity166 features aside , just being able to make calls on a smartphone is a big step			0
" cell phone calls are something that are very difficult for hearing aids to do , " said @entity170 , chief audiologist at @entity15 , who helped develop the device			2
@entity96 , who is hearing - impaired himself and was part of an early test group using the hearing aids , said he used to avoid talking on his smartphone			0
when he did take a call , he would push the volume up on his phone and then place the receiver above his hearing aid , searching for the elusive sweet spot where he could best hear the caller			1
now , he says , he actually prefers that people call him on his cell			0
the hearing aids are still specialized medical devices , meaning you wo n't find them on the shelves of your local @entity194			0
customers must have their hearing tested and get fitted for the devices by an audiologist			0
and they 're not cheap : a single @entity21 hearing aid can cost about $ 3,000			2
@entity4 added support for the new technology when it released @entity26 7 last year , but these are the first hearing aids to actually work with many of the system 's accessibility features			1
because of the specialized technology , a third - party hearing - aid maker ca n't just jump in and create devices that work with @entity26 without partnering directly with @entity4			1
@entity15 executives have not revealed whether they are developing hearing aids for @entity214 devices or other platforms			2
@entity15 worked on this specific technology for almost two years , so other companies might have some catching up to do			2
however long it takes , this marriage of medical and consumer technology is the first step into a welcome future for hearing - impaired people			0
" this is the first generation , but there 's no doubt that what we can do by marrying a phone and a hearing aid will explode , " @entity170 said .			1

@entity4 and @entity16 company @entity15 have *teamed* up on a new hearing aid
the technology pairs with the latest @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20
wearers can stream stereo audio from their mobile devices directly to their ears
*doctors* and manufacturers hope @entity4 's integration will do away with hearing aid stigmas
