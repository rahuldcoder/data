-- the " conservagencia " is starting to give @entity1 a second look			1
but the stirrings of respect may be too little , too late			0
too bad , because he might stand the best chance of beating president @entity9			0
@entity11 hunting has become a reflexive sport inside the @entity13			1
and so when @entity1 entered the presidential race , the impulse was to smack him on style points as a @entity11			1
it made some sense on the surface -- after all , he was the former @entity9 ambassador to @entity20 , in addition to being the conservative former governor of @entity23			2
at a time when @entity26 enthusiasm tended toward the hot , @entity1 was cool , promising a campaign of civility and ideas			1
he seemed to be courting independents and centrists at the outset of the @entity13 primary , openly dissing the anti-intellectualism of conservative populist candidates such as @entity37 gov. @entity36 and @entity39 rep. @entity38			1
in one infamous tweet , he pined : " i believe in evolution and trust scientists on global warming			0
" all this was very out of step with the partisan tone of the times			0
and so his actual record as governor and his policy plans as candidate were overlooked			0
forget the record of cutting taxes , reforming government , improving the business climate and balancing the budget			0
forget that he was the one candidate with real - world foreign policy experience			0
he was an apostate in a cult - like atmosphere where any dissent is seen as disloyalty			0
no one was happier than the @entity66 , which was apparently most worried about running against @entity1 ( " i think our guys were worried about @entity1			1
i think he was the one who people were most worried about " recounted one @entity9 aide in @entity73 writer @entity72 's and author @entity74 ' new e-book , " @entity76 " )			2
so @entity1 had the buzz but no support -- he seemed stuck in the low single digits and even would - be supporters shrugged their shoulders			2
it seemed to say more about the current makeup of the @entity13 than it did about @entity1			1
after all , he was the first candidate to embrace @entity39 rep. @entity85 's plan for deficit reduction			2
his jobs plan was touted by @entity88 in uncommon terms : " mr. @entity1 's proposal is as impressive as any to date in the @entity13 presidential field , and certainly better than what we 've seen from the front - runners			1
" he even had the guts to proclaim a determination to end the collusion and market distortion of " @entity99 " -- a cause that could unite @entity101 and occupy protesters			0
but even though 70 % of @entity11 primary voters say that economic issues are their primary focus , @entity1 's conservative substance could not seem to override the centrist style : he would not pander or throw radioactive red meat			1
even the statistical analysis by the fivethirtyeight blog at the @entity111 , which found @entity1 would have the best chance of actually beating @entity9 in the 2012 general election , did not seem to change hearts and minds			2
but as the revolving door of not - @entity117 spun faster and faster , spitting out candidates from @entity38 and @entity36 to @entity119 and @entity120 , a desperate search for an electable conservative alternative to @entity123 commenced			2
and now , all of a sudden , the @entity23 governor has started to get some respect			0
@entity0 contributor @entity126 was an early advocate of @entity1 's substantive record as a conservative , in contrast to the style he evinced at the start of his campaign			1
" in this @entity11 primary , a candidate 's conservativeness seems to be measured by his venom toward @entity9 , " @entity119 wrote in @entity134			0
" and i 'm afraid we 've elevated style to such a degree that it 's clouding our view of what is conservative			1
" @entity145 editor and @entity0 contributor @entity144 is another unexpected voice lately arguing that @entity1 might just be the real conservative in the race : " his record as a governor is more conservative than @entity120 and @entity123 combined			1
he is more pro-life than either of them			0
he is more economically wedded to the free market than either of them			0
he has better foreign policy experience than either of them			0
@entity1 should be a conservative hero in this race			1
" conservative wise man @entity160 even seems to be making the case in comments delivered on the " @entity163 , " saying : " i think if you look at @entity1 's record , what he 's laid out , his proposals for taxes and the economy , his opposition to @entity167 , you could make a case that he deserves a searching second look from conservatives			1
@entity1 's position on foreign policy is the most conservative			1
that is , it is the most modest in assessing the need and ability of the @entity39 to control distant events			0
" @entity1 is putting all his chips on @entity186 , where he 's been inching forward in the polls			1
unlike the @entity190 caucus , it 's a state with an open primary where independents can vote and a principled center - right perspective might be rewarded			0
tonight he will get a chance to shine in a @entity196 style debate with @entity197 in @entity186			0
it might prove to be a highlight of the 2012 campaign -- a substantive and civil debate about ideas , providing more light than heat			2
as conservatives consider the choice between the two flawed front - runners , @entity197 and @entity123 , they might reconsider the wisdom of purging center - right candidates like @entity1 on matters of style versus substance			1
in the process , they just might finally find the perfect marriage of ideology and electability for which they have been looking			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity221 .			2

@entity221 says some conservatives are starting to give @entity1 another look
he says @entity1 a modern *anomaly* : a cool conservative with campaign of civility , ideas
he says @entity66 worries about him ; as @entity13 candidates fall , his prospects are rising
@entity221 : @entity13 is wary of @entity1 's style , but should consider electability , substance
