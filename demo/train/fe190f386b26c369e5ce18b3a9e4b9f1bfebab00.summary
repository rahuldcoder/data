model @entity0 is n't a pro golfer but she 's made it onto the cover of the latest issue of @entity6			1
the controversial move has left some women in the sport frustrated as the magazine defends its position			1
@entity6 , which bills itself as " the authority on how to play , what to play and where to play , " has explained that as the fianc√©e of @entity14 pro @entity13 , @entity0 is a major celebrity in the golf world and thereby qualifies the recognition of a cover story			1
" sports figures , celebrities and models have appeared on @entity6 covers since the magazine 's beginning , " the publication 's editor in chief , @entity26 , says in a statement			2
" @entity0 ranks at the high end of the golf celebrity scene today , and she has a compelling story to tell			2
she also might get some new people interested in the game			0
" but to some members of the @entity37 , choosing @entity0 -- who , yes , is the daughter of hockey great @entity38 -- means a female pro golfer is getting overlooked			1
" it 's the state of where we 've always been			0
we do n't get the respect for being the golfers we are , " @entity44 , a top - ranked @entity45 golfer , has told press , according to @entity47			0
" obviously , @entity6 is trying to sell magazines , but at the same time you like to see a little respect for the women 's game			1
" in the @entity6 piece , @entity0 discusses her involvement in the sport and demonstrates six golf - improvement exercises			1
on the cover and in two of the photos used to promote the issue , which is available via tablet starting april 8 and from newsstands starting april 15 , she does n't wear the typical golf attire but rather fitted workout pants and a sports bra			0
@entity6 appears to have anticipated the reaction to the cover , as it already has an answer to the question , " what 's @entity0 doing on the cover of @entity6 ? " up on its website			1
the response falls in line with what editor @entity26 says in his statement : given the fact that @entity0 is " as much a subject of fascination at tournaments as the guy she 's there watching , " combined with the fact that " she 's an attractive , fit woman who -- like many of our prospective readers -- is fairly new to golf ... she seemed a natural cover subject for our second annual issue devoted to fitness			2
" that position seems to answer the query veteran golfer @entity94 has asked : who , exactly , is @entity6 trying to sell to ? " if the answer is men 25 years old through 45 years old , then i guess that 's what they have to do , " she told @entity47			2
" you know the old saying , sex sells			0
and nobody can argue with that			0
it 's just the way it is			0
but the @entity37 has some attractive women and very fit women , so why not use them ? i 'm just baffled by it			0

@entity6 's new issue featuring @entity0 has *sparked* questions
@entity0 does not play the sport *professionally* , but is *engaged* to a pro golfer
it 's left women in the sport frustrated by the lack of recognition
