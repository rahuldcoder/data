a few weeks ago , i said @entity3 's @entity2 outreach was not visible to the naked eye			1
i try to call ' em as i see ' em , even when it means criticism of my own party			0
today , i see a @entity3 @entity2 blitz			1
@entity2 volunteers are holding events , making phone calls , knocking on doors			2
@entity3 began to spend significant resources on @entity17 tv ads in swing states with a sizable @entity2 population			1
he 's doing an interview with @entity21 , speaking to the @entity24 hispanic @entity22 and participating in a @entity25 , all this week			2
my unsolicited advice to @entity3 : @entity27 ! for the love of @entity29 , @entity3 , acknowledge you are in front of @entity32			1
it 's ok to talk to different communities about specific issues that affect them more than others			2
if done correctly and with sincerity , it is called speaking to your audience			0
if it strikes an inauthentic note , it 's pandering			2
earlier this year , @entity3 spoke to the @entity43			1
he mentioned " @entity45 " twice , once while thanking his hosts			1
recently , he spoke at an event in @entity47 , @entity48			0
you may have thought it was taking place in @entity47 , @entity52			0
he made no comments specifically targeted to the thousands of hispanics braving the heat and humidity to hear him			0
@entity3 never mentioned foreign policy toward @entity58 , not even @entity59			1
how someone fails to do that in the heart of @entity63 @entity47 is puzzling			2
@entity65 , for his part , has been working the @entity45 community			1
in the past six months , it 's reached a fever pitch			2
the @entity70 @entity69 was a parade of @entity32 : elected officials , celebrities , singers , students and even an undocumented young woman , representing the @entity78 students who would qualify for legal status under a potential @entity78			1
@entity65 knows winning the @entity45 vote is key			1
just as crucial as the margin of victory is the level of turnout			0
@entity65 's task is to maintain his current numbers of 65 % to 68 % support and increase voter enthusiasm			1
@entity3 must chip away at @entity65 's lead			1
he will have a difficult time winning the election with his @entity2 poll numbers hovering around 30 %			0
hispanic events provide an opportunity to ask tough questions			2
@entity3 and @entity65 have some explaining to do			1
like many other voters , @entity45 want to hear more specifics from @entity3 and @entity65			1
whether its economic policy or foreign policy , they would like the candidates to get past lofty platitudes			2
many hispanics live in @entity48 , @entity104 and @entity105 , which have been disproportionately affected by the foreclosure crisis			0
they want to know how they are going to get out of houses that are underwater and mortgages that are overwhelming			0
@entity2 unemployment has run significantly higher than the national average ( now 8.1 % ) during the @entity65 administration			1
it is still high at 10.2 % , according to the @entity114			0
on education , @entity2 dropout rates continue to be higher than the national average			0
last year , it was estimated by one study to be as high as 28 %			0
these are real problems that require real solutions			0
we want to hear concrete steps towards opportunity			0
note to @entity3 : take a deep breath			1
close your eyes and jump ! you must address this issue			0
continuing to avoid it turns it into an albatross around your neck			0
@entity3 needs to move beyond his positions during the primary			1
he promised to veto the @entity78			0
he should then tell us if and how he plans to confront the predicament these young people face			0
proposing to staple a green card to the diploma of foreign students graduating from @entity24 universities does not cut it			0
while he 's at it , he should say what he plans to do about the administrative order issued by the @entity65 administration that provides @entity78 temporary status for two years			1
if he becomes president , will he revoke it or will he let the order stand for at least the initial two - year period ? a simple yes or no will suffice			0
there also needs to be a responsible plan to deal with securing our borders and enforcing our immigration laws but also providing a practical and humane solution for the 11 million undocumented people already here			2
unless it 's meant as a lame attempt at humor , " self - deportation " is not an adequate response			2
talking of self - deportation , there 's a question as to whether @entity170 , the @entity171 secretary of state who advocates the concept and is credited as the architect of @entity105 's controversial @entity175 law , is an adviser or a supporter to @entity3			1
which is it ? @entity3 has not publicly embraced dreamers , but he 's had no difficulty embracing the guys who give us nightmares , such as sheriff @entity184 , @entity24 rep. @entity185 of @entity186 and @entity170			1
how should @entity45 feel about that and what role , if any , would any of them play in a @entity3 administration ? @entity65 has his share of explanations to give			1
many latinos have felt great economic pain during his administration			0
some of us , who do n't think we should give one inch to anti-democratic regimes in @entity58 , did not like seeing @entity65 in a discussion of missile defense , tap then - @entity201 president @entity200 on the knee and promise more flexibility in a second term			1
what does that mean vis - a - vis the likes of @entity208 or @entity209 ? in 2008 , @entity65 promised @entity45 he would pass comprehensive immigration reform			1
he had a majority in the @entity212 and @entity213 and a powerful mandate for his first two years , and he failed to so much as present a plan , much less push for its passage			0
blaming @entity218 for his broken promise is silly			0
he passed his other priorities , including health care reform and the stimulus package , with practically no @entity218 support			2
those first two years , where @entity65 showed will , he found a way			1
he chose not to make immigration a priority			2
why should we believe him now ? how does he plan to pass any meaningful reform in his second term when 1 ) he will be a lame duck from day one ; and 2 ) he will in all likelihood have a @entity218 - controlled @entity212 and very divided @entity213 ? @entity65 has not been known to cultivate congressional allies , @entity70 or @entity218			2
passing controversial legislation will not be easy			0
four years ago , @entity65 chanted , " @entity236 , se puede ! " ( yes , we can ! ) he 's grown older and grayer ; so have we			1
he could n't and did n't in his first term			0
he 'd be well - served to acknowledge that and take some responsibility , instead of just laying the blame elsewhere			2
@entity45 are disappointed in @entity65 and distrustful of @entity3			1
both of them have seven weeks to change that			0
the clock is ticking .			0

@entity245 : @entity3 is *furiously* wooing @entity45 voters now . some advice : connect !
she says at events , he fails to acknowledge @entity32 ' concerns , but he must for support
she says @entity3 seems allied with immigration *hardliners* such as sheriff @entity184
@entity257 : @entity65 's let down @entity32 significantly ; both candidates must *convince* them
