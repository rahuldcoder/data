-- major conflict could return to southern parts of @entity4 unless international action bolsters a faltering peace accord , ten aid agencies said in a report released thursday			1
a resumption of conflict between north and south in @entity4 , meanwhile , would make a sustainable peace impossible in @entity13 , a region of western @entity4 that has been the scene of what the @entity15 calls genocide , the aid groups said			1
" it is not yet too late to avert disaster , but the next 12 months are a crossroads for @entity26 's largest country , " said @entity18 , policy advisor for @entity19 and the report 's co-author			0
the warnings were underscored by news thursday of a clash that killed scores in @entity4 , the latest instance of tribal violence among southerners that has alarmed the @entity34			1
locals said fierce fighting in @entity37 , one of the most remote regions of the south , killed 140 people , wounded 90 , and led to the theft of tens of thousands of cattle early this month or in late december , the @entity34 said			1
" the human toll is massive -- hundreds if not thousands displaced			0
the death toll is massive , " said @entity45 , a top @entity34 humanitarian official in @entity4			2
" these attacks are a matter of great concern			0
" resurgent tribal violence in the south also concerned the 10 aid groups			2
they released their report , " rescuing the @entity62 in @entity4 , " two days before the fifth anniversary of a 2005 peace deal that ended a grinding war between the @entity59 government and southern rebels in the @entity61			1
they said that peace deal is " on the brink of collapse			1
" that war pitted a northern government of @entity69 against southern blacks who follow @entity71 and traditional african religions			0
it killed 2 million people and forced several million others from their homes			2
the peace deal conferred limited autonomy on southern @entity4 and ended one of @entity26 's longest and deadliest wars even as a separate conflict that erupted in 2003 raged in @entity13 , killing roughly 200,000 , the @entity34 says			1
despite the peace deal , violence in the south increased last year , @entity18 said , and it could escalate further to become one of the biggest emergencies in @entity26 this year			1
about 2,500 people were killed and 350,000 fled their homes in southern @entity4 last year , the aid agencies said			1
many died in tribal violence between southerners			0
outside countries have ignored the problem and have not provided sufficient help , the agencies said			0
the @entity34 says more people have been killed in southern @entity4 in 2009 than in @entity13 , where a separate conflict drew international attention , prompted charges of genocide and led the @entity101 to indict the @entity59 president , @entity102 , for war crimes			1
some southerners blame their former enemies in the north for instigating violence in the south			0
as the south plans to participate in national elections in april , many southerners say the north has hindered access to registration materials , logistical support and voter education , the @entity34 said			2
the north denies those charges , but they 're among the reasons that analysts worry about an outbreak of north - south violence in a region already buckling under the weight of corruption , cattle rustling and revenge attacks			0
@entity4 needs diplomatic involvement from neighboring countries and the international community to help secure the 2005 peace agreement , said @entity130 , international director of @entity131 , one of the agencies that produced the report			1
" a return to war is by no means inevitable , but it depends whether the world heeds the warning signs of the past year and has the political will to save the peace , " @entity130 added			0
other agencies that produced the report include the @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144			0
the report urges the @entity145 to ensure that protecting civilians becomes a core priority for a peacekeeping force in @entity4			1
the agencies also called on the international community to mediate between the northern and southern parties before the national elections -- the country 's first multi-party elections in 24 years -- and before a referendum on independence , which is scheduled for early next year			0
@entity4 is roughly the size of @entity157 but has only 30 miles of paved roads and few health facilities			0
it is so underdeveloped that the @entity34 says a 15 - year - old girl in the south is more likely to die in childbirth than finish school			2
" after five years of peace , southern @entity4 remains one of the poorest regions on earth			1
people hoped the peace would bring economic benefits and development , but this has happened far too slowly and in some areas not at all , " said @entity168 , country director of @entity143 in @entity4			2
" we are very worried about children who seem to be increasingly targeted in attacks on villages , " he said			0
" international donors and the government must urgently improve aid to these areas			0
