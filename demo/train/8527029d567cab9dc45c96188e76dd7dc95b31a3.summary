-- thousands of people are expected to march in @entity2 on sunday to commemorate the 1972 @entity4 massacre of local people by @entity7 troops			1
organizers expect it to be the last march of its kind , since the @entity7 government finally admitted last year that its troops , not the demonstrators , were to blame			1
" the great lie has been laid bare			0
the truth has been brought home at last , " the republican political party @entity17 said in a statement sunday			1
@entity17 seeks for @entity2 to become part of the @entity22 , rather than the @entity7			1
in june , the @entity7 government released a damning report that reversed decades of official explanations for the 1972 killings			1
the paratroopers who killed 14 people had no reason to believe they were under threat from the victims , gave no warnings before firing and lied to the far - reaching official inquiry into the seminal event , the inquiry concluded			1
its report was a comprehensive rejection of the @entity7 government 's official account of the killings , which had stood for 38 years			2
" some members of our armed forces acted wrongly ... and for that , on behalf of the government -- indeed , on behalf of our country -- i am deeply sorry , " @entity7 prime minister @entity46 said after the release of the long - awaited report			2
@entity4 took place in the single bloodiest year of a conflict that claimed about 3,000 lives over a three - decade period known locally as @entity52			0
the killings strengthened the @entity54 , increased @entity56 hostility towards the @entity7 army and " exacerbated the violent conflict of the years that followed , " its report found			2
@entity17 is closely associated with the @entity54 , which laid down its arms as part of a 1998 peace agreement			2
@entity7 troops fired more than 100 rounds on @entity4 , in violation of orders issued to every soldier serving in @entity2 at the time , the report found			1
there was some provocation by the @entity54 in @entity71 that day , but nothing that justified the shootings of civilians , the report found			0
only one victim was associated with the @entity54 , and he was probably not posing a threat when he was fatally shot , the report found			0
@entity4 has been considered by many as one of the greatest injustices of @entity2 's troubled history			0
even the name of the city where it happened is disputed , with @entity87 nationalists calling it @entity71 and @entity90 unionists calling it @entity71			0
addressing the question of how high responsibility for the massacre should go , the report overwhelmingly placed it with the soldiers who were on the ground , along with their commander , lt. col. @entity98 , who decided to launch the incursion			0
the report said there is no evidence that either the @entity7 or @entity2 governments " intended , planned , or foresaw " the events of that day , or that either government tolerated or encouraged the use of " unjustified " lethal force			1
@entity0 's @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 contributed to this report .			0

sunday marks the 39th *anniversary* of the massacre in @entity2
a report last year found @entity7 troops were to blame for the killing of 14 people
that reversed decades of official explanations
@entity17 : " the truth has been brought home at last "
