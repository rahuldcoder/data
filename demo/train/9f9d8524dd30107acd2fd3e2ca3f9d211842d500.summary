@entity0 -- you may have heard that a group of @entity4 in @entity5 -- including @entity4 rock star and possible vice presidential pick sen. @entity7 of @entity8 -- are getting ready to introduce their version of the @entity10 also may have heard that @entity12 lawmakers and liberal advocacy groups despise the @entity4 alternative and derisively label it " @entity15			1
" as someone who has written about immigration for more than 20 years and hammered @entity19 and @entity4 ( including @entity7 ) when appropriate , i call the @entity4 approach to the @entity15 something else : a common sense solution			1
it could break a stalemate and improve millions of lives			0
and it could only be opposed for ugly partisan reasons			0
while it 's not perfect -- and no piece of legislation is -- it is better than nothing , which is all the critics have been able to offer , even when @entity19 controlled both houses of @entity5 and the @entity35			0
like the bill that has been kicked around in @entity5 for more than a decade , and which met its demise in december 2010 when five @entity19 effectively killed it by voting against cloture on the debate , the @entity4 plan would give undocumented students a path to legal status in exchange for going to college or joining the military			1
but unlike the earlier version , it would not include a path to citizenship			1
students could become citizens later			1
it 's not like they 'd be barred from the citizenship process			0
but they would have to take the initiative			0
it would be on them , as it should be			0
of course , @entity19 hate this idea -- for three reasons			0
some of the 50 @entity19 who voted in favor of cloture in support of the original @entity15 may have been moved by the humanitarian argument that young people brought here by their parents should n't be forced to languish in the world of the undocumented			1
but for others , it is likely that their vote was a political calculation			0
if hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrant students could gain legal status , many of those people would become loyal @entity12 voters for life			1
but if citizenship is n't in the mix , and there are no votes to be had , why bother ? 2			1
@entity7 is attached to the bill , and , in fact , seems to have been put front and center by @entity4 colleagues such as sen. @entity90 of @entity91 and sen. @entity92 of @entity93			1
@entity19 know that the @entity96 - @entity95 senator is on the short list of likely running mates for @entity4 nominee @entity99			1
and that has to terrify them			0
besides , they know that putting him on the ticket could lure some @entity107 support away from @entity19 -- especially given that , according to polls , a majority of @entity107 voters disapprove of president @entity112 's handling of immigration			0
if they can torpedo the @entity116 , they might just hobble @entity7			0
but if they ca n't , and @entity7 uses the bill to score points with @entity107 voters , it could be a nightmare for @entity19 in november			2
many congressional democrats , and for that matter , most of the other critics of the @entity4 bill , do n't really understand what is at stake in the debate over illegal immigration			1
they approach the issue of what to do with the undocumented in the third person , like rich folks who talk about poverty over lunch			1
if you want to know what the immigration debate is really about , you need to get out of the @entity142 echo chamber and ask an illegal immigrant			0
why would you ask a @entity95 citizen who takes for granted all the benefits that come with citizenship ? take it from me			0
i was born in the @entity95 , as were three of my four grandparents			0
so while i care about the immigration debate , the truth is that my destiny , and that of my family members , does n't rise and fall on whether @entity5 stops passing this hot potato and finally tackles immigration reform			2
i can sympathize with the undocumented , but i ca n't empathize			1
so when they talk , i shut up and listen			0
what i 'm hearing from the illegal immigrants i 've interviewed -- who also happen to be parents of teenagers who are also undocumented -- is emphatic support for a bill like this			2
they do n't care about citizenship , and they care even less about voting			2
all they care about is putting their kids in a lifeboat			2
many of those kids are planning to go to college and start lives of their own like their classmates , and the last thing their parents want to do is explain why that is impossible			1
while @entity5 dickers on this issue , all these people hear is the ticking of the clock			2
they understand the value of a solution , even if democrats in @entity5 do n't			2
of course , there is always the possibility that those who are so quick to criticize a bill they have not even seen yet may not be interested in solutions at all			0
maybe what they really want is the problem -- something to hurl at their opponents at election time to rile up @entity203 so they turn out and vote for @entity19			1
if that is the case , then shame on them			0
this is n't a game			2
this is about peoples ' lives and finding the best way to enrich them without turning our country 's principles inside out			0
we tried the @entity19 ' approach			0
many of them backed the original @entity15 , but the leadership could n't even convince every @entity221 in the @entity19 to support the bill			1
now let 's give the @entity4 a chance			1
and give politics a rest			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity229 .			1

@entity229 : @entity4 plan to *float* new version of @entity15 a step in right direction
he says plan would let kids who are undocumented be legal but not citizens if in college , military
he says dems do n't like this , as they want to claim @entity15 and loyalty of @entity203
@entity229 : some dems *faltered* on pushing issue through ; time to give new plan a chance
