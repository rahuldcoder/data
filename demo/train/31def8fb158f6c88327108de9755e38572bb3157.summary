-- as criminal attorneys , we know that tragic cases very often bring festering social issues into public view			0
@entity6 was right : the @entity8 case brings to the surface troubling questions not only about race but also about the role of handguns in our society			0
now that the shooter , @entity21 , has been charged with second - degree murder , his defense under @entity18 's " @entity19 " law will become the focus of discussion			1
this law is grounded in a factual error and a deeply flawed principle			2
the factual error is that a proliferation of handguns makes us safer			0
the flawed principle is that somehow the right to bear arms needs to be enlarged to a right to resolve disputes with guns			1
the notion that guns make us safer is a fallacy			2
people with guns in their homes are much more likely to be killed with their own gun -- by accident , domestic violence or suicide -- than to use it ever against an intruder , according to @entity50 , writing in the @entity51			1
similarly , people who carry guns are more likely to be shot and killed than those who are unarmed			1
a @entity54 study found that people carrying guns were 4.5 times more likely to be shot and 4.2 times more likely to be killed			1
that study 's author , @entity56 , has speculated that one reason may be that guns give carriers a sense of empowerment that causes them to overreact in tense situations			2
that may be precisely what happened in the case of @entity21			0
@entity18 's @entity19 law changed the previous understanding of self - defense in a simple way			1
traditionally , one could only claim self - defense if there was no reasonable chance to retreat from a situation where one felt threatened			0
the revised law says if you feel threatened with imminent great bodily harm , you may use force , including guns , against the person you find threatening , even if there is a reasonable opportunity to retreat			1
what this invites is the settling of personal disputes with guns , as evidenced by a 300 % increase in the number of killings by private citizens justified by " self - defense " in @entity18 since the law passed			1
most murders involve young men , often as both shooter and victim , as in the @entity8 case			2
young men , of course , often get in conflicts where they are threatening one another : that is , where both of them are trying to scare the other with " imminent great bodily harm			0
" @entity18 's law may allow one of those chest - bumping young men , without consequence , to end the mutual dispute by shooting the other dead on the street			1
when it is over , the only witness may be the shooter , and his version of events will presumptively control			2
there is no morality in this rule			0
nothing in our constitution even vaguely promotes the redress of grievances with guns ; the " redress of grievances " clause of the @entity130 has nothing to with the " right to bear arms " described in the @entity136			1
rather , what the @entity124 protects is the ability to redress our grievances by petitioning our government			0
there may be no more damning indictment of our society than this : we too often seem to be equipping our young men with the guns and excuses to kill one another , rather than the safe schools and knowledge it takes to frame a good and righteous petition			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers .			0

writers : " right to bear arms " does not include a right to use guns in disputes
gun owners most likely to be killed by their gun , writers say , and more likely to be shot
disputes solved with guns , they say , and justifiable *homicides* *tripled* since @entity18 law *enacted*
after a person is killed , the only witness may be the shooter , writers say
