-- @entity1 has one foot in the quarterfinals of the @entity3 after beating @entity4 3 - 1 in the first leg of their last 16 tie at @entity8 on thursday			1
after being thumped 4 - 0 by @entity9 at @entity10 in the @entity11 last weekend , @entity4 manager , @entity13 bemoaned his players ' lack of character and guts			1
if he was hoping for a response after the public dressing down , he did n't get one as @entity4 produced another error - strewn performance			1
the visitors opened the scoring after 29 minutes when @entity26 's through - ball set @entity27 free down the right before the @entity30 striker unleashed a clinical left - foot finish past goalkeeper @entity32			0
@entity26 helped earn the @entity35 side 's second of the night after catching @entity4 striker @entity36 in possession yards outside his own penalty area			2
the midfielder 's snap shot was then tipped over the bar by @entity32			0
but there was nothing the @entity45 keeper could do from the resulting corner as an unmarked @entity47 headed home to double the lead with just under an hour played			0
@entity50 halved the deficit with a brilliant free kick in the 64th minute to give the home fans some hope of a revival , but it was @entity58 ' side who continued to look more threatening in attack			0
@entity1 's persistence paid off with six minutes remaining as former @entity62 international @entity47 scored his second and his team 's third of the night			2
the defeat was @entity4 ' first at home in 11 @entity68 fixtures while last year 's runners up stretch their winning run to five in the competition			0
there was also joy for @entity73 who beat @entity76 's @entity75 1 - 0 at the @entity77 do @entity78			1
@entity76 , who guided @entity9 to glory in the competition last season , will require all his famed tactical nous in the return leg next thursday after @entity86 striker @entity85 's 57th minute strike handed @entity73 the advantage			2
over in @entity91 , @entity76 's old club @entity88 -- who he steered to the @entity3 success in 2004 -- has all but booked a place in the quarterfinals after a 3 - 0 against @entity94 in @entity95			1
the visitors won convincingly despite having @entity97 sent off in the 25th minute for a foul on @entity99 inside the penalty area			0
@entity99 could n't convert the spot kick and @entity88 , who were already a goal to the good thanks to @entity105 's fifth minute strike , made the most of the slip , despite the numerical disadvantage			0
@entity109 doubled the lead in the 33rd minute before @entity111 put the match , and most probably the tie , beyond the @entity91 with a third away goal			2
elsewhere , @entity116 's @entity115 drew 0 - 0 with @entity119 side @entity117 while the all - @entity121 clash between runaway @entity123 leaders @entity124 and fourth - placed @entity125 ended in a 1 - 1 draw			1
in the all - @entity30 tie , @entity127 , who are anchored at the foot of @entity130 , recorded a fine 2 - 0 win at seventh - placed @entity133			1
@entity45 side @entity134 has almost guaranteed passage through to the last eight with a comprehensive 4 - 1 win over @entity139 side @entity138 while @entity141 side @entity140 will take a slender advantage into the second leg against @entity145 's @entity144 after winning the first leg 1 - 0 at the @entity147			1
