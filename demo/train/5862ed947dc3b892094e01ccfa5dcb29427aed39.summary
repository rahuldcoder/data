last week the @entity0 filed a petition with the @entity2 asking it to stop the government 's collection of telephone records of @entity7 customers			1
it was not a decision we took lightly			0
but as an organization dedicated to protecting privacy , we had no choice			2
of all the recent revelations about the government 's surveillance activities , the most significant is a secret court order that required @entity7 to provide to the @entity17 -- on an ongoing basis -- the call detail records on all of its customers			1
not since the congressional hearings of the @entity24 -- the @entity25 committee that investigated widespread intelligence abuses in the 1970s -- has there been evidence of such extensive spying by the @entity30 government on the @entity30 public			0
but unlike then , the digital data of the modern telephone network allows for an extraordinary sorting and sifting of digital information today			0
a phone number is easily linked to a person , perhaps a doctor , a minister , a family member , or a close friend			0
call detail records can also reveal where people are and who they are with			0
such information can be very useful when tracking a particular target in a criminal or intelligence investigation , but collecting such data on all @entity30 who have a telephone is without precedent			0
in our filing with the @entity2 , the @entity0 asked a simple question that we hope the @entity2 will answer : is it legal for the government to collect so much information about so many people suspected of no threat to national security ? according to the law -- section 215 of the @entity65 -- the government is only allowed to obtain such information if it is " relevant " to an " authorized investigation " and if its use is for very narrow purposes			1
how could it possibly be that all of the customers of @entity7 could be subject to an authorized investigation of the @entity30 government ? to us that seems impossible			1
and that is also the view of some of those who wrote the law and who served on the court that applies the law			2
rep. @entity85 , @entity86 , the original author of the @entity65 , recently said he was " extremely disturbed " about the news of the @entity7 order and said it was " not consistent with the @entity65			1
" retired judge @entity90 , who served on the secretive @entity91 , said he was " stunned " to learn about the court 's broad authorities			0
the views of @entity85 and @entity90 are shared by many legal scholars			0
it is simply inconceivable that @entity97 could grant legal authority for the routine surveillance of all of our telephone records			0
and the secrecy surrounding these activities -- not only was the court order kept secret , but so too was the legal justification -- should set off alarm bells			1
if the government has a good justification for the program , it should not be difficult to provide a public explanation , even if some of the details must be withheld			0
some are surprised that our organization went directly to the @entity2			2
they point out that the @entity2 prefers hearing disputes after the issues have been considered by lower courts			2
but under the special rules of the secret court that issued the @entity7 order , we had no choice			1
only the government or @entity7 could have objected to the order of the secret court			1
they did n't , so we turned to the one court that has the ultimate authority to say what the law allows			1
and if there is one case that justifies review under the @entity2 's " mandamus " standard , our organization 's challenge to the @entity17 's domestic surveillance program is that case			1
over the next month , we look forward to working with legal scholars , technical experts and others who have expressed support for our petition			0
they will be filing friend of the court briefs to explain to the @entity2 in more detail the important issues in our case			1
we anticipate that the @entity2 will consider our arguments when it returns in early october			2
still , there is more to do			0
we believe that the @entity17 's decision to undertake domestic surveillance has also triggered a provision of law that requires the agency to take public comments			1
we believe that the public should have the opportunity to express its views on the program			0
whether you oppose or support the @entity17 's domestic surveillance program , your views should be heard .			2

@entity168 : @entity170 group wants @entity2 to step in on privacy
he says secret court order makes @entity7 give call record info to @entity17
he says : @entity65 powers can only be used in certain *circumstances*
