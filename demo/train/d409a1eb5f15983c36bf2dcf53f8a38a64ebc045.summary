-- federal agents ca n't account for more than 1,400 guns after a widely criticized operation aimed at tracing the flow of weapons to @entity7 drug gangs , sources with knowledge of the investigation tell @entity0			1
of 2,020 guns involved in the @entity13 probe dubbed " @entity14 , " 363 have been recovered in the @entity15 and 227 have been recovered in @entity7			1
that leaves 1,430 guns unaccounted for , the sources said			1
the @entity13 operation was intended to build cases against @entity7 drug cartels by allowing firearms to go from the @entity15 into @entity7			1
the hope was by tracing the guns in @entity7 , agents would be able to determine the structure of various cartels and then bring them down			1
the problem was that once the guns were allowed to " walk , " there was no way to recover them until they turned up at crime scenes			2
the operation has been widely criticized in @entity35 , with the chairman of a @entity38 committee that investigated the issue calling it " felony stupid			1
" @entity40 , the @entity13 's former attache in @entity41 , told @entity0 the operation never should have happened			1
" guns traditionally are just not allowed to leave the undercover operation for fear that it will enter into the criminal element and then be subsequently used in a crime at a later date , " @entity40 said			1
" and the last thing any one of us as law enforcement officers wants to have attributed to us is the death of an innocent individual by a gun that was lost during one of our operations			0
" but the @entity13 knowingly allowed individuals to purchase weapons that they knew would end up in the hands of criminals on both sides of the border			0
and when @entity68 agent @entity14 was killed in @entity69 in december , two @entity65 variants that were allowed to " walk " under the program were found at the scene			2
in @entity7 , the operation drew sharp criticism from top officials , who have long said that @entity15 weapons are fueling the country 's bloody drug war			1
and @entity13 agents in @entity69 told the @entity78 in june that they cringed every time they heard of a shooting after the program had been under way for some time			0
over the past several months , questions have arisen regarding who in government knew about and sanctioned this operation			2
even though the operation was run out of the @entity13 's field office in @entity89 , @entity40 said it is highly unlikely that officials at the @entity92 in @entity93 were not informed			2
" you have to understand , this program was in operation 18 months or more before we had any idea it existed , " said sen. @entity94 , @entity95			2
" and as i look back on it now , it was a , it 's a big joke " -- one @entity94 says is n't so funny since the guns have turned up in the hands of criminals			0
in late june , president @entity107 said " appropriate action " would be taken once an investigation of the program is completed			0
but so far , details about who knew what and when have been scarce			0
last week , the embattled acting director of the @entity13 , @entity114 , was interviewed by congressional investigators in a closed session			0
while the content of the interview remains confidential , @entity114 's personal attorney was at his side			0
@entity94 has stated he plans on seeing this investigation to its conclusion			0
" there 's a basic principle of government here that the people in the @entity92 are forgetting -- the public 's business should be public , " he said .			0

" @entity14 " involved more than 2,000 guns , sources tell @entity0
fewer than *600* have been recovered in the @entity15 and @entity7 , they say
the operation has been sharply criticized by *members* of @entity35
