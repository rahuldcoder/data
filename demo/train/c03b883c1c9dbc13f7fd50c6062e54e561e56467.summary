humans are causing a steep decline in populations of reef sharks in the @entity4 according to a new study by a group of international marine scientists			1
the new estimates of reef sharks compared numbers around populated islands with those living near uninhabited ones			1
the results were sobering , say researchers			0
" we estimate that reef shark numbers have dropped substantially around populated islands , generally by more than 90 % compared to those at the most untouched reefs , " said lead author @entity14 from the @entity15 at the @entity16			1
over 1600 underwater surveys across 46 @entity23 pacific islands and atolls were undertaken in the study and combined with data on human population , habitat complexity , reef size and satellite records			1
the estimates were gathered using " towed - dive surveys " where paired @entity34 divers record shark sightings while being towed behind a small boat			2
it 's a method which provides a more accurate census of mobile reef fish like sharks over large areas , according to researchers			0
" around each of the heavily populated areas we surveyed -- in the main @entity46 , the @entity47 and the @entity48 -- reef shark numbers were greatly depressed compared to reefs in the same regions that were simply further away from humans , " @entity14 said			1
" we estimate that less than 10 % of the baseline numbers remain in these areas , " he added			0
co-author of the study , @entity56 from @entity58 's @entity57 says the human disturbances to reef shark populations are likely down to fishing -- either incidentally caught in the nets of commercial or recreational fishermen or by direct targeting for their fins			1
" reef shark fins are not the most valuable because they tend to be smaller than other sharks , but a lot of other oceanic sharks have already declined a lot so that 's why fisherman are now turning to them , " @entity56 said			2
she estimates these fins sell for around $ 100 per kilogram with demand coming from @entity79 markets where shark fin soup can be found on the menu for weddings and business banquets			2
reef sharks , which are around six to eight feet long ( 1.8 meters to 2.4 meters ) , are the " apex predators " of coral reefs @entity56 says , and like predators in other eco-systems play an important role in structuring food webs			0
but there is still much to learn about their specific role			0
" frankly , we 're still trying to figure out what predators do on reefs			0
the reason for that is because most predators have been removed from reefs			0
most reefs that coral reef biologists study are moderately to heavily degraded , " @entity56 said			0
the study forms part of the @entity23 's @entity107 's @entity106 and is published online in the journal @entity109 .			1
