@entity0 -- a federal court ruled friday that the evidence supporting an alleged causal link between autism and a mercury - containing preservative in vaccines is unpersuasive , and that the families of children diagnosed with autism are not entitled to compensation			1
special masters of the @entity13 released more than 600 pages of findings after reviewing three test cases and finding all the claims wanting			1
" petitioners ' theory of vaccine - related causation is scientifically unsupportable , " wrote @entity18 in her conclusion about @entity21 , whose parents , @entity23 and @entity24 , had brought one of the suits			2
" in the absence of a sound medical theory causally connecting @entity21 's received vaccines to his autistic condition , the undersigned can not find the proposed sequence of cause and effect to be logical or temporally appropriate			2
having failed to satisfy their burden of proof under the articulated legal standard , petitioners can not prevail on their claim of vaccine - related causation			2
" in the second test case , special master @entity44 wrote , " the record of this case demonstrates plainly that @entity53 and his family have been though a tragic ordeal , " referring to the minor , whose parents , @entity48 and @entity49 , had brought suit			1
" after studying the extensive evidence in this case for many months , i am convinced that the opinions provided by the petitioners ' experts in this case , advising the @entity49 family that there is a causal connection between thimerosal - containing vaccines and @entity53 's autism , have been quite wrong			1
" the special master italicized the last two words			2
" nevertheless , i can understand why @entity53 's parents found such opinions to be believable under the circumstances			2
" " in this case , the evidence advanced by the petitioners has fallen far short of demonstrating such a link , " he said			0
in the final test case , special master @entity76 wrote of @entity78 , a minor , that his parents , @entity85 and @entity86 , " have not demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that @entity78 's condition was either caused or significantly aggravated by his vaccinations			1
thus , they have failed to establish entitlement to compensation and the petition for compensation is therefore denied			0
" @entity91 set up the special judicial forum , sometimes called the " vaccine court , " in 1986 to address claims over vaccine safety			1
@entity96 , who attended the hearings and said her 12 - year - old son , @entity98 , has been diagnosed with autism she blames on vaccine , described herself as " devastated " with the rulings , but not surprised			1
" the deck is stacked against families in vaccine court , " she said in a telephone interview from her home in @entity104 , @entity105 , about 20 miles north of @entity106			1
" you have government attorneys defending a government program using government - funded science before government judges			0
where 's the justice in that ? " @entity119 , a @entity120 , @entity121 - based lawyer for the families involved , said his clients were disappointed			0
" all three families are committed to following the appeals process , and pursuing that avenue to get justice and compensation for their kids , " he said			0
the special masters ' decisions are subject to review by judges in the @entity13			1
within the next 30 days , attorneys for the families will ask the claims court judges to review the decisions and rule that the children are , in fact , entitled to compensation			2
after government lawyers have a chance to respond to the motions for review , the judges will schedule oral argument and hearings , probably in the summer , @entity119 said			0
though friday 's decisions do not end the legal battle , dr. @entity146 , chief of infectious diseases and the director of the @entity149 at the @entity150 , was optimistic			0
" parents should take heart in this decision and continue to immunize their children with the confidence that they are the safest , most effective way to protect against dangerous diseases , " the pediatrician said			0
" it 's time to move forward and look for the real causes of autism , " said @entity161 , president of the @entity162			2
" our children deserve real answers and at this point doing more and more studies of vaccines , when the science is so clear , would be allowing politics to triumph over science			2
" the three test cases represented thousands of children who have autism and whose parents contend their disorder was triggered by an early childhood vaccination			1
the vaccines contained thimerosal , a mercury - derived compound the parents say helped bring on regressive autism , in which normally developing children suddenly exhibit learning disorders and behavioral problems , typically between ages 1 and 2			1
the theory that vaccines or thimerosal can cause autism is rejected by most medical experts , including the @entity193 , the @entity194 and the @entity195			1
multiple scientific studies also have failed to prove a link			0
@entity198 was removed from infant vaccines in 1999			0
in february 2009 , the court 's special masters concluded that the evidence supporting a link between measles - mumps - rubella vaccine , or @entity205 , combined with thimerosal - containing vaccines , was also unpersuasive			1
this week , the @entity208 @entity207 agreed to hear the appeal of parents who say that a range of vaccines administered to their child caused serious health problems			1
the justices on monday agreed to decide whether drug makers can be sued outside the vaccine court			1
the lawsuit was brought by the parents of @entity220 , a girl from the @entity222 , @entity223 , area			0
the parents said she was healthy as an infant in 1992 when given a series of @entity229 shots -- a combination of vaccines to prevent diphtheria , pertussis ( whooping cough ) , and tetanus			0
after the third series , according to court briefs , the child began having seizures and became disabled			1
now a teenager , @entity220 continues to suffer what is described as " residual seizure disorder			0
" the @entity243 alleged @entity244 failed to adequately warn them and other parents of the risks associated with the vaccine			2
the vaccine court rejected the initial claim , so the family tried to revive the lawsuit in other federal courts			1
a federal appeals court eventually ruled for @entity254 , now owned by @entity255 , concluding all design - defect claims were barred under statute			0
despite that victory , the company urged the high court to hear the case , saying it seeks final resolution on the broader legal questions			0
the @entity265 administration also urged review and is supporting the company and the federal law in question			0
@entity254 and other drug manufacturers say their products are generally safe , but side effects can occur in rare cases			0
@entity1 @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 and @entity278 contributed to this report .			0
