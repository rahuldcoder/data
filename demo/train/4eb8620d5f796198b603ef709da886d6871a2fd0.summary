-- in the @entity3 capital of @entity4 , not even the notorious traffic congestion can slow the voracious demand for property			1
roughly 10 million people live within the urban core of this vast city while a further 28 million populate the suburbs			1
with affluent cash - buyers and local businesses driving the housing market at a rapid pace , anyone with a hope of climbing on the property ladder has to move fast to secure value			2
" the prices go up really quickly , " said @entity19 , a local property investor			2
" if you think ' oh you know i do n't have enough money now , ' you 're not going to then catch up with the race because property prices in @entity4 go up above 10 % a year , " @entity19 added			1
this is the reality of apartment hunting in what has become one of the hottest property markets in the world			2
in the vast @entity37 residential building under construction downtown , for example , only a handful of the 1,200 units remain unsold -- a story that is repeated across the city			0
according to @entity42 , managing director of real estate agents @entity44 and @entity45 , @entity41 are keen to snap up new builds like these as soon as they come online			0
" more @entity3 are buying high - rise now , either for primary or secondary residence , and also for investment purposes ... given the growth in the economy and the buying power of the middle class , " @entity42 said			1
" i think coupled with that , the increase in traffic issues and rise in fuel prices , that has also been another major driver for people really looking to try to be located closer to the areas of the workplace and within the more central @entity4 areas , " he added			1
but land is scarce in this sprawling metropolis , ensuring throwing up new buildings is no easy task			0
for each new multi-million dollar high rise or office tower threatening to change the skyline , kampungs ( make shift dwellings found closer to earth ) occupy the space in between			0
yet despite the lack of room and high demand adding to the premium of new - builds , some developers say there is still far more value for money to be found in @entity4 than in other popular @entity84 cities			1
" nowadays our range price of apartments is about $ 2,500 or $ 3,000 per meter square , " said @entity85 , assistant vp for marketing development at property developer @entity87			0
" if you compare to the other countries in @entity84 , in @entity95 for instance , it could be per meter square it could be $ 15,000 or $ 20,000 , so that 's why compared the other city around the world , @entity4 it 's a very attractive , exotic property for investors			1
" and with that international optimism , local expectations are rising			0
the @entity105 predicts solid future growth for @entity45 's economy although there remains much work to be done in improving infrastructure within @entity4 to ensure further expansion in the property market			2
for now , however , local buyers like @entity19 will have to remain sharp to secure that bargain			0
