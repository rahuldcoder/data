@entity0 , @entity1 -- the office of maj. gen. @entity4 has a bank of six flat - screen televisions covering most of one wall , showing all the main international @entity9 news channels , and several local ones besides			1
major general @entity4 addresses a news conference in @entity0 on april 28 , 2009			2
this is one of the rooms where @entity1 's media war is being fought , and @entity4 , the @entity1 army 's main spokesman , is a key part of the battle			1
@entity18 kid with him that @entity2 is n't among the channels on his screens , and he seems slightly hurt , insisting it is			0
he 's right and i 'm wrong -- @entity2 was on a commercial break			0
in fact , i rather get the impression @entity4 , who has become the face of the army 's operation against @entity30 militants in the @entity31 , watches our coverage closely			1
one of his subordinates complains about one of our reports -- not the accuracy , but something in the general tone			0
perhaps @entity2 has been just a little too questioning of the army 's daily press releases , which claim hundreds of enemy fighters killed , and tightly controlled media trips			0
whatever @entity4 thinks of @entity2 , he is more than willing to explain how the @entity1 army sees the broad picture as it fights in the @entity31			1
the current conflict there is intricately linked to the situation in @entity50 , in his view			1
he sees @entity31 as a political problem , which can only be partially solved by military intervention			2
he claims many of the @entity30 's arms are coming across the border from @entity50			1
i ask if that includes @entity59 weapons , as suggested in recent reports , and he agrees			0
he says @entity61 is too focused on the safety of @entity1 's nuclear arsenal			1
the @entity66 should " stop worrying about the nukes and start worrying about the weapons lost in @entity50 , " he says			2
a @entity66 government report last month warned that the @entity68 did not have " complete records " for about one - third of the 242,000 weapons the @entity66 had provided to the @entity50 army , or for a further 135,000 weapons other countries sent			2
the @entity50 army " can not fully safeguard and account for weapons , " the @entity74 found			0
i ask how well armed the @entity30 are , and he says they are " very well equipped from the border area			2
" he also conspiratorially suggests they also are getting weapons and support from " foreign intelligence agencies			0
" when i ask what that means , he smiles and says he ca n't elaborate -- declining to repeat the speculation in the press here that @entity86 , @entity1 's traditional rival , may be somehow involved in stirring up trouble on @entity1 's northwestern border			1
but the very suggestion plays to a military strategist 's nightmare scenario -- the @entity1 army bogged down in the northwest , unable to focus on the disputed province of @entity97 , a key element of its conflict with @entity86			1
the military wants to get done in @entity31 as soon as possible , but the general acknowledges its troops will be there for some time			0
he estimates that 10 to 15 percent of the @entity30 there are foreign fighters : " well - trained @entity106 , @entity50 , with a sprinkling of central @entity108 and @entity109			1
" he also says there are @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 fighting , as @entity1 has become the destination du jour of the international jihadist , with @entity106 in commanding positions and the other foreign fighters bringing in expertise			0
he thinks that perhaps @entity119 , the main town at the gateway to the @entity31 , may be secured in 48 hours , but it may be much , much longer before the area is totally pacified			0
" first you have to disarm the @entity30 and then re-establish the writ of government , " he says			0
he admits that @entity31 and neighboring @entity126 " were lost to the state " and that now " we are paying in blood for areas we had already occupied			0
" now , he says , the army is set for a long fight			0
" we are prepared for that -- we are mentally prepared			0
" but they are also prepared for the conflict to be taken to other parts of @entity1			2
a building belonging to the country 's powerful intelligence agency , the @entity137 , was bombed in @entity139 this week			0
the @entity30 claimed they carried out the attack and @entity4 says the security services expect more attacks			1
just hours after i left him , his fears were confirmed , as details came in of more bombings in @entity147			0
and then there is also the risk of the @entity30 using the mass exodus of civilians from the @entity31 as cover to penetrate other towns and cities			1
already almost 3 million people have flooded out of what was once a tranquil tourist destination , and the military fears that among the mass movement of humanity there will be those plotting to strike at the heart of @entity1 's cities			1
" it 's a very big issue -- a serious concern , " @entity4 says			2
he describes the conflict in @entity31 as " an existential threat " -- a fight for the very existence of @entity1 in its current form			1
and he seems acutely aware that the portrayal of that conflict to the @entity174 will be critical .			1
