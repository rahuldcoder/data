-- the chairman of the club that hosts @entity4 's most prestigious golf tournament skirted the prickly issue of women 's membership wednesday , saying it is a private matter			1
during his annual media session , @entity8 , chairman of @entity9 , did not comment specifically on @entity11 , the top executive at @entity12 and , undoubtedly , one of the corporate world 's most powerful women			1
@entity12 's sponsorship of the masters tournament guarantees club membership for its officers , but @entity11 is a woman , and the club does not allow women to join			1
" well , as has been the case , whenever that question is asked , all issues of membership are now and have historically been subject to the private deliberation of members , " @entity8 said			1
" that statement remains accurate ; it remains my statement			0
" @entity12 spokesman @entity30 told @entity0 wednesday that the company would not comment on the controversy			1
the question of @entity11 's membership has again brought the gender controversy to the forefront			1
women 's rights activist @entity38 tried to change the exclusionary policy nine years ago when she showed up at the @entity9 entrance to lead a series of protests against men - only membership			1
her efforts were in vain			0
now , she says , " the boys " at @entity9 , members and sponsors alike , find themselves in a big bind			2
" the ' woman problem ' is back , " she wrote in a column for @entity0 on tuesday			0
@entity38 says there are only two choices at hand : @entity9 can open its doors to women , or @entity12 can yank its money and force its male executives to resign from the club			2
" those are the only two options that are viable that are going to wash with the public , " @entity38 told @entity0 last week			0
@entity9 's membership -- which includes titans of industry and finance -- has been male - only since the club 's opening in 1932			1
when @entity38 tried to change things in 2002 , @entity9 's then - chairman , @entity72 , resisted , saying that gender integration would not come " at the point of a bayonet			1
" in 2006 , @entity38 was among a group of @entity79 shareholders who accused the company of violating its discrimination policies by supporting the tournament			0
nonmembers can play on the course only when hosted by members			0
@entity9 is famously secretive about its membership , and the club declined to comment on the issue , as did @entity12 spokesman @entity89			1
" @entity9 is a private club , and their personal membership is an internal matter , " he said			2
@entity12 , however , has played a role in changing policy before			2
the company pulled television ads from the @entity97 when it was played at the whites - only @entity100 golf club in @entity101			2
the club admitted its first @entity103 in 1990 and now claims former secretary of state @entity104 as a member			0
@entity9 also did not welcome its first black member until 1990 , when @entity108 television division president @entity107 joined the club			0
on the eve of the 2012 masters opening thursday , speculation surfaced that @entity8 , known to be more progressive than his predecessor , will offer @entity11 a membership , but only after the tournament ends and the gender debate dies down			1
" sorry , but that dog wo n't hunt , " @entity38 wrote			0
" telling @entity11 to be a good girl and wait a little longer with @entity12 's collusion would be a disaster -- not only for the company 's image , but for @entity11 's credibility as its leader			1
" more and more people are asking @entity9 to man up and get rid of what they say is a discriminatory policy from the past			2
@entity8 did not announce any sweeping changes from the hot seat wednesday			0
that means that @entity11 will probably not show up this year in a green jacket			0
the question is : will she ever ? @entity0 's @entity134 and @entity135 contributed to this report .			0

@entity9 chairman @entity8 is asked about the men - only membership policy
he says membership is " subject to the private deliberation of members "
@entity11 , @entity12 's top executive , can not join despite her company 's sponsorship
her status has *reignited* the gender controversy as the masters begins
