@entity0 -- @entity3 's @entity2 struck down key parts of a law that would protect prime minister @entity6 from prosecution			1
the law was designed to halt criminal proceedings against top government officials for 18 months on the grounds that they are too busy to appear in court			1
but @entity3 's top court ruled that 18 months is too long , and that judges , not politicians , should be the ones to determine if a defendant is free to appear in court			1
the law will automatically be modified to conform with the ruling when the @entity2 publishes its verdict			2
the court heard arguments tuesday about the legality of the " legitimate impediment " law , which would have granted top @entity3 government officials what amounted to immunity while they were in office			1
the @entity6 - backed law said top government officials could not be prosecuted because their official duties made it impossible for them to attend court hearings			1
the law was approved in march 2010 , but prosecutors in @entity36 challenged the constitutionality of the measure , saying it should be judges , not politicians , who determined whether someone had time to attend court			0
two separate trials against @entity6 are pending			0
he 's accused of bribing a witness to commit perjury in one case , and of tax fraud and other financial irregularities in another			0
both trials began but were suspended when the immunity law was passed			0
@entity6 has called the charges politically motivated			0
a third case against the prime minister , also related to tax fraud , is in preliminary stages			0
@entity6 has been tried on at least 17 charges since first taking office as prime minister in 1994 , but remains very popular with the @entity3 public			2
the immunity law was due to expire 18 months after it was passed , which would have been in october .			2

new : the law will automatically be modified by the court ruling
the @entity3 law would have stopped prosecutions against top officials for 18 months
a court says that 's too long , and that judges must decide who can face trial
@entity6 faces two *ongoing* prosecutions and another is pending
