more than 200 years after @entity2 and @entity3 first buried it in @entity4 , it took an hour to remove all the objects crammed inside a tiny time capsule			1
onlookers anxiously watched the unveiling tuesday , worrying the items might not have weathered the years very well			2
" could we actually go through the whole box , or would things prove too fragile to take out ? " said @entity10 , director of @entity4 's @entity11			0
" it was like brain surgery , with history looking down on us			0
" piece by piece , @entity17 , head of objects conservation for the museum , removed each item , whispering " wow " as she first caught a glimpse of some of them			1
among the stash @entity17 removed from the 1795 time capsule : five folded newspapers , a @entity31 commonwealth seal , a title page from @entity31 colony records and at least 24 coins			1
and at the bottom , an inscribed rectangular silver plate , " probably made by @entity3 and engraved by him , " @entity10 said			1
" that was the treasure at the end , " he said			0
but getting to it was a painstaking process			0
it took seven hours to remove the time capsule from the @entity44 in december , and more than four hours before tuesday evening 's ceremony for officials to loosen the screws that were holding it shut			1
@entity49 , dental tool used to remove contents at the broadcast event , which took place at the museum in front of a painting of @entity57 , @entity17 used a porcupine quill and her grandfather 's dental tool to help her safely remove the contents of the 10 - pound box , which was uncovered during repairs for a water leak at the @entity65 last month			0
the box - shaped capsule was placed in the @entity65 cornerstone in 1795 by @entity3 , the metalsmith , engraver and @entity71 hero ; @entity2 , the brewer and governor of @entity31 ; and @entity75 , a local developer , when construction began			1
@entity3 was responsible for overlaying the @entity65 dome with copper			1
the time capsule measured 5.5 x 7.5 x 1.5 inches , officials said			1
it 's not the first time the box has been uncovered			2
in 1855 , during some other repairs , the time capsule was removed and its contents cleaned , only to be put back in the cornerstone for almost 160 years -- with a few objects added			1
the box 's materials were noted in reports of the time			2
but this time , historians have had the opportunity to go through the contents with modern tools			2
after its removal december 11 , the box was taken to the @entity11 , x-rayed and given a thorough once - over			0
having an idea about what might be inside was nothing compared to actually seeing it , @entity10 told @entity1			0
" though we knew a little bit about what was in the box , it was a moment of extraordinary excitement as this brass container just the size of a cigar box was slowly opened with surgical precision , and you suddenly found yourself in the presence of history , " he said			0
newspapers inside the box were in " amazingly good condition , " @entity17 said			2
the large number of copper coins inside might have helped protect the artifacts , she said , since copper helps block the growth of fungus			2
the collection of coins recovered from the time capsule included half - cent , one - cent , half - dime , 10 - cent and 25 - cent coins			1
another set of coins included a pine tree shilling from 1652 and a copper medal showing @entity57			2
appraiser : items worth hundreds of thousands of dollars " this is the most exciting project i 've ever worked on , " a beaming @entity17 told the crowd after she finished pulling out all of the box 's contents , describing how thrilling it was to be part of building a bridge between the past and the present			1
" this is what we , as conservators , live for , " she said , sharing a fist bump with @entity145 , executive director of the @entity146 and @entity147			0
going forward , conservators will work on preserving items removed from the time capsule			1
they might not unfold the newspapers , @entity17 said , in order to protect them			0
if they were to go up for sale , the objects inside the box would fetch a pretty penny -- not because they 're rare , but because of the history behind them , said @entity164 , an appraiser for the @entity167 program " @entity168			2
" " the story 's fantastic			0
@entity57 was still the president of this country until 1797			0
... the 17th century coin is maybe a 5 or 6,000 - dollar coin , but with this story , the value increases tenfold , " he said			0
experts say they have n't been able to confirm whether @entity3 made the silver plate , which commemorates the placement of the legislature 's cornerstone by @entity2 and @entity3 on july 4 , 1795			1
if @entity3 did make it , @entity180 said , " the value has to be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars			1
" but do n't expect to see these objects showing up at any auction			0
after the conservation process is finished , they 'll go on display at the museum			0
and eventually , the time capsule and its contents will be placed again in the cornerstone of the @entity44 , said @entity193 , secretary of the commonwealth			1
one question still remains , @entity193 said : will officials add anything new to the time capsule before they put it back ? " the governor has wisely suggested that we might , " he said , " so we 'll think about it			1
" @entity1 's @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205 contributed to this report .			0
