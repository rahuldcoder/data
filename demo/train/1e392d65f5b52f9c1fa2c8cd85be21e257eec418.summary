" @entity113 said thousands of villages and at least 288,000 homes have been destroyed			0
" six thousand villages wiped out the face of the earth , " @entity27 said			0
" from 5,000 to 50,000 per village , we have no way of counting			0
we have nothing operational as to how many of those have died and how many are alive			0
" huge swaths of @entity1 remain without power , clean water or communication			2

the @entity21 reports $ 99.5 million has been pledged , and donors have committed or contributed $ 47.8 million to the @entity21 emergency response in @entity1 , but $ 300 million more is needed			1

@entity44 secretary of defense @entity187 on wednesday authorized 19 @entity189 and @entity190 heavy - lift helicopters to @entity1 to relieve six @entity192 helicopters that have been taking part in flood relief since saturday			1

@entity187 said the @entity1 will decide the speed of distribution			2

" for the sake of @entity226 , do n't accept donations from the @entity44 because they are our enemies , " said @entity223 , spokesman for the @entity224 in @entity1			1
" whatever amount the @entity44 will give as donation , we will give the government of @entity1 more			1
" many @entity1 have not been happy with the government 's response to the floods , calling it slow and ineffective			2
