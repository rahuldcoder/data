-- it would n't be a finale to " @entity3 " without at least a few moments that make you gasp , and sunday night 's season ender certainly delivered			1
last week , several survivors , including @entity8 and @entity9 , arrived at @entity10 in what was promised to be a safe haven , but was it really ? we caught up this week with @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 -- interspersed with flashbacks to the comparatively idyllic life back at the prison -- and they too had a rough road to @entity10			1
here are some of the big moments from this week 's episode : 1			1
@entity25 meets @entity15 again just when it almost seemed like @entity15 's trio had it all figured out ( he even created a new way to trap game ) , they were set upon by @entity25 and his up - to - no - good crew of " rule followers " with @entity34 in tow			1
despite @entity34 begging for mercy , @entity25 's men started to beat him to death , while others set upon @entity16 and @entity17			2
@entity15 fights back , big time when @entity15 saw his son in trouble , he moved his head back and injured @entity25 , whose gun went off			0
@entity15 -- well , there 's no other way to put this -- then bit @entity25 on the neck and went after the rest of his crew , including the man who attacked @entity16 , repeatedly stabbing him to death			2
the other survivors could n't believe what they were seeing			2
needless to say , do n't mess with @entity16			0
on the bright side , @entity34 is back			0
he and @entity15 are like brothers now , too			0
the post-racial revolution will be televised 3			0
welcome to terminus @entity15 , @entity34 , @entity17 and @entity16 finally arrived at @entity10 -- sneaking in through the back , of course			1
the moment @entity15 noticed one of the denizens of @entity10 wearing @entity65 's watch ( now owned by @entity8 ) , he pulled a gun on someone -- and wait , is n't that woman wearing @entity9 's poncho , too ? it just would n't be a finale without a shootout , and we certainly got one as @entity15 and crew fired against @entity76 and the rest from @entity10			1
what is this place ? entrails seen in a courtyard ? a room where the words " never again " are painted on the walls ? something 's just not right with @entity10			1
unfortunately , we did n't find out too much more about this			0
reunited @entity76 finally gets the upper hand and orders @entity15 , @entity34 and @entity17 ( the " ringleader , archer and samurai " ) to enter a train car			0
an enraged @entity15 asks about his son , and @entity76 tells @entity16 to walk over to the car			0
when they make their way in , they soon realize that @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity97 and others in their group are alive			0
@entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 are still making their way to @entity10 , as far as we know , but @entity107 's whereabouts remain unknown			1
@entity15 delivers one of the best lines in the series ' history when he tells @entity8 , " they 're going to feel really stupid when they find out ... they 're screwing with the wrong people			0
" @entity15 certainly proved that with his actions this week			2
he 's gone from a lawman to the " @entity118 " to something of a go - for - broke violent avenger over the years			1
were you happy to see so many of the survivors reunited and find out that no one died in this finale ? share your thoughts in the comments .			2
