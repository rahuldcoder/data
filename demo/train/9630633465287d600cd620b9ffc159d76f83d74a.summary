-- when president @entity2 signed the @entity3 , he reportedly said @entity4 would lose the @entity5 for a generation			0
at the time , 115 of the 128 senators and representatives from the 11 former @entity10 states were white @entity4			0
today , all @entity4 congressmen from @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 are black , except for @entity17 of @entity16 ; and all @entity19 congressmen from these states are white , except for @entity21 of @entity15			0
part of that has to do with policy			0
and a lot of that has to do with the white backlash @entity2 correctly predicted			0
so if @entity29 , chairman of the @entity31 , and his cohorts are really serious about bringing minorities into their big tent , they need to do more than massage the party 's message			1
they need to do more than rethink its policies			0
they have to be honest about who is in their tent already			0
i applaud the effort of the @entity31 's 98 - page @entity47 report			1
but it 's hard to characterize it as an honest assessment of the party when it does n't include the words " racism , " " racists " or " racist " in it			1
how can this so - called " autopsy " be accurate when it does n't include the cause of death ? i 'm not saying the @entity19 is full of bigots			2
i 'm saying history teaches us that the @entity19 is where white racists in the @entity5 turned for shelter in response to the @entity3 and the remnants of that migration is still impacting its image today			0
to characterize the @entity19 's difficulties to grasp the country 's new demographics as " they 're too old and white " oversimplifies a conversation that is much more nuanced than that			0
the reason why some minorities -- particularly blacks -- have a distaste for the @entity19 is because any policy that negatively impacts minorities disproportionately is being viewed through the electoral dynamic that was created in 1964			2
opinion : want black votes , @entity47 ? listen to black voters if @entity29 and company ca n't see and admit that , their new plan is not going to solve much of anything			1
i agree with @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 on a lot of issues			0
as an independent , it really pains me to know much of their messages get tainted nationally because their party has this lingering image problem			1
as the glaring omissions in the @entity47 report suggests , this wound is self - inflicted			1
for as long as @entity47 leaders refuse to acknowledge and confront racism in their party , they will continue to have a hard time convincing minorities they have their best interests in mind			1
now , i 'm sure spending $ 10 million to pay people to hang out with minorities and talk about how great the @entity19 is seems like a good idea			2
but when there is footage of a black man being beaten and run over by a group of white teenagers who reportedly wanted to " go fuck with some niggers " nearly 50 years after @entity2 signed the @entity3 , trust me , minorities are not looking for rent - a - friend to come talk to us about the @entity19			2
we 're looking for advocates who will listen			0
who can see the @entity5 is not the south of bus boycotts and burning crosses -- but it is still the @entity5			0
who will see that @entity133 , who opposed the @entity3 , won 87.1 % of @entity13 's votes in the 1964 general election and that lawmakers in @entity13 just got around to ratifying the 13th amendment in 2013			0
@entity138 , whose son was found dead along a rural @entity13 road in 2009 , did n't receive her first visit from the @entity142 until @entity0 reporters called asking about the progress of the investigation this year			2
" he came in and said he was the investigator , " @entity138 said			0
" he told me he apologized for no one coming out before now			0
and he told me that the first investigators they had did n't do anything			2
" more than three years had gone by , and the authorities did n't bother to look for who had killed her son			2
if @entity19 leaders really want to appeal to minorities -- put that in the report			1
and do it not as a way to pander for votes , but to acknowledge the problem			1
there is definitely a fair share of bigots in the @entity164 , and liberals can be quick to attribute problems impacting minorities to racism			1
but far too often , the @entity47 is quick to dismiss racism as a factor in anything , which draws attention to the party 's lack of self - awareness			1
the @entity19 as a whole is saddled with the perception of having a diversity problem , and its recent political history justifies that perception			1
from what i know of @entity29 , he is smart enough to know all of this			1
the fact this issue is not addressed in the report suggests he still is n't sure what to do about it			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			2

the @entity31 released a report on how to connect with minorities
@entity191 : the @entity47 is saddled with the perception of having a diversity problem
he says if @entity47 leaders refuse to acknowledge racism in their party , minorities will stay away
@entity191 : it seems @entity29 still does n't know how to address the issue
