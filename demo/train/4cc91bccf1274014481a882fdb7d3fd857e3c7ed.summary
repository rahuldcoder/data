@entity0 -- @entity5 prime minister @entity4 will cut short his trip to @entity7 to deal with the nation 's phone - hacking scandal , his office confirmed monday -- another day of dizzying developments that also saw a second top police official resign and the announcement of a broader police corruption probe			1
the day also brought the death of a key figure in the allegations			2
@entity18 reporter @entity17 , who told the @entity19 in 2010 that former newspaper editor @entity20 encouraged him and other reporters to hack into the voice - mail accounts of public figures , was found dead , according to the @entity24			1
@entity26 police confirmed that a man 's body was found and " pronounced dead at the scene shortly after			1
" the death is " being treated as unexplained , but not thought to be suspicious , " the department said in a written statement			2
@entity5 is in an uproar over the scandal , which has cast its shadow not just across @entity5 journalism , but also @entity37 and the prime minister 's office			1
it began with the phone - hacking allegations involving reporters from @entity42 -- which led its parent company , @entity44 's @entity43 , to shut it down -- and quickly broadened into claims that journalists had paid police for confidential information			1
it has led to the resignations of the commissioner and assistant commissioner of @entity0 's @entity53 , known as @entity37 , forced the closure of one of the country 's best - selling newspapers and resulted in 10 arrests			0
among those arrested is @entity60 , the @entity62 editor and @entity64 executive who resigned after the scandal broke			1
it also forced the resignation of @entity20 , who quit as @entity4 's communications director in january as the scandal began to heat up			1
@entity20 was @entity18 editor when one of the newspaper 's reporters and a private investigator were sent to prison after pleading guilty to phone hacking in 2007			1
" i do n't think anybody anticipated that it would snowball in this fairly dramatic way , " said @entity77 , a @entity0 - based lawyer and former bureau chief for @entity79			0
@entity4 said monday that he 'll request a special session of @entity84 on wednesday to address the scandal , even flying back early from @entity7			1
" i think it may well be right to have @entity84 meet on wednesday so i can make a further statement , update the @entity88 on the final parts of this judicial inquiry and answer any further questions , " he said			1
@entity4 was referring to a broader corruption probe announced in @entity84 on monday by home secretary @entity93 amid allegations that police accepted payments from journalists in exchange for confidential information			0
may said she would ask @entity101 to examine " instances of undue influence , inappropriate contractual relationships and other abuses of power			0
" the inspectorate is a division of the @entity109 that inspects and reviews police forces in @entity5 to ensure they operate according to standards			0
the allegations are part of a widening scandal that began with revelations that journalists working for the @entity18 newspaper had eavesdropped on the phone of a missing girl , @entity120 , and deleted some of her messages to make room for more			1
she was later found dead			1
already , metropolitan police commissioner @entity126 has resigned on sunday and the assistant commissioner , @entity127 , on monday after being caught up in the scandal			2
@entity127 ruled two years ago that there was no reason to pursue an investigation into phone hacking by journalists			2
he has since called his decision " crap			0
" he was due to be suspended when he quit , the @entity136 said			0
he denied monday he had done anything wrong , saying in a prepared statement that he feared the scandal and allegations against him would be a distraction as @entity0 prepares to host the @entity142			2
" i have acted with complete integrity and my conscience is clear , " he said			0
@entity126 quit after revelations a former @entity18 executive editor , @entity146 , was hired as a communications consultant for the police			1
" i carry ultimate responsibility for the position we find ourselves in , " @entity126 told reporters			0
" with hindsight , i wish we had judged some matters involved in this affair differently			0
i did n't and that 's it			0
" @entity126 stressed sunday that he had behaved ethically , but decided to resign because increased scrutiny may burden his department and detract from its accomplishments			0
he also denied @entity146 , who was arrested in the probe , was involved in phone hacking when he was brought on as a consultant			2
such denials , though , did n't halt the @entity165 from announcing monday that @entity127 and @entity126 are among four current or former senior @entity0 police officials it has been asked to investigate			0
the complaints against @entity127 include his role in failing to pursue a 2009 investigation into allegations of phone hacking , as well as claims he was inappropriately involved in getting a job for a friend 's daughter , the commission said			2
the commission said it will look into @entity126 's overall role in the initial investigation into phone hacking , as well as that of two other unnamed officers			2
may told @entity84 that , in addition to the inspectorate 's inquiry , she also will consider additional resources and powers for the @entity165			0
she also has asked @entity188 , former parliamentary commissioner for standards , to evaluate ethical considerations that should guide police relationships with the media			2
the management board of the @entity53 has already agreed to new standards regarding its officers ' relations with media , including recording meetings between police and reporters and publishing information on the @entity201 , may said			0
" mr. speaker , there is nothing more important than the public 's trust in the police to do their work without fear or favor , " she said			0
@entity84 is set to meet tuesday , when hearings scheduled on the scandal			2
@entity214 is due to appear alongside @entity44 and his son @entity215 , a @entity43 executive			1
earlier monday , a spokesman for @entity214 said the former editor 's sunday arrest by police would not interfere with her plans to testify			0
she was released on bail until october , police and her spokesman , @entity222 , said			0
@entity214 ' lawyer , @entity224 , said monday she is not guilty of any crime			0
he warned that police need to consider the damage they had inflicted on her reputation after arresting her and questioning her for nine hours , but not putting any charges or documents before her			0
her husband got swept up in the scandal monday , with the allegation he 'd been trying to discard evidence after investigators found a bag in a trash bin near the couple 's house			1
@entity214 ' spokesman , @entity222 , told @entity1 the bag had been brought there by a friend of @entity214 ' husband , @entity214 , before being tossed by a cleaner or security guard			0
@entity222 said he and three others in the apartment building were looking for the bag when police arrived , hoping to collect it			0
the spokesman insisted that authorities would discover quickly that the material inside the bag is irrelevant to the investigation and " has nothing to do with @entity60			0
" @entity214 , who resigned friday as chief executive of @entity64 , is one of 10 people arrested in connection with the phone - hacking probe and the fourth arrested in the bribery investigation , according to police			2
police said monday that they will take no further action against one of the people who was arrested , a 34 - year - old woman			0
@entity5 press reports identified her as @entity276 of the @entity24 , who is thought to be the only person not working for @entity44 who has been arrested in the probe			1
@entity43 itself got hacked late monday , when the hacker group @entity279 claimed credit for targeting @entity281 , one of the @entity5 papers under the conglomerate 's media umbrella			1
it redirected those on the paper 's website to a false story claiming @entity44 had been found dead in his garden			1
soon after that link was taken down , those going to the @entity281 's website were redirected to @entity279 's @entity295 page			1
the hacks that have gotten investigators ' attention are alleged to have been done by @entity43 employees			1
police in the @entity5 have identified almost 4,000 potential targets of phone hacking in documents recovered from a private investigator working for @entity42			2
the @entity305 is also investigating @entity43 after a report that employees or associates may have tried to hack into phone conversations and voice mail of september 11 survivors , victims and their families			1
an @entity305 spokesperson added monday the investigative agency was " aware of the media reports " that actor @entity316 was hacked in the @entity317 and that @entity43 had settled several lawsuits with @entity317 businesses , but said there would be no official comment " since these matters are under review			1
" @entity44 's @entity43 encompasses @entity325 , @entity326 , the @entity327 , and @entity329 publishers in the @entity317			1
@entity64 -- a @entity5 subsidiary of @entity43 -- owns the @entity281 , @entity330 and the @entity331 in @entity5			1
@entity1 's @entity332 , @entity333 , @entity334 , @entity335 , @entity336 , @entity337 and @entity338 contributed to this report .			0
