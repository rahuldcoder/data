@entity0 , @entity2 @entity1 , a 9 - year - old who loved football and was known to tackle people with a bear hug and a smile , huddled on top of a classmate as a tornado barreled through their elementary school here in central @entity2 one year ago this week			1
a wall crushed and killed @entity1 , his mother told me ; but he shielded the other student from the rubble and saved her life			1
in the year since that tornado , @entity20 , 41 , has been working tirelessly to convince @entity2 lawmakers that the best way to honor her son 's legacy is to try to equip every school in the state with a tornado shelter or safe room			1
she 's given dozens of interviews and granted more than 100 speaking requests			1
she 's gathered signatures for a petition and walked the halls of the state @entity35			1
her argument seems to fit the definition of reasonable : students are required to attend school ; therefore , schools should be required to ensure they are safe from violent storms			1
it also comes with an emotional gut - punch : her son 's elementary school , @entity48 , in @entity0 , @entity2 , did not have a storm shelter			1
@entity1 's life , and those of six other students who died in that @entity54 storm , might have been spared if the state or school had protected them			1
" something good 's got ta come out of this , " @entity20 told me			1
it should , but there 's little sign the state is listening			1
related : walking the 17 - mile path of the tornado efforts to fund or require shelters statewide so far have been snarled in the political process , with @entity69 and @entity70 disagreeing about how to fund upgrades			1
republicans , in a plan endorsed by gov. @entity73 , want to let school districts hold local elections to decide if they should issue extra bonds to pay for construction			0
to @entity1 and others , including a prominent @entity80 , that plan does nothing to actually create shelters			1
it only asks districts if they want to take out extra bonds to pay for improvements			0
they want a franchise tax on corporations to be used to fund improvements statewide			0
the bickering has done little to improve policy			0
frustrated , @entity1 figures if you ca n't beat ' em , join ' em. she 's running for a seat in the state legislature on a pro-shelter platform			1
@entity0 , the city hardest hit , updated its building codes to require new homes to be built with safer garage doors and with roofs that are fastened to the walls			0
that 's been heralded as a big improvement			1
better , however , would be requiring storm shelters with all new construction -- for both schools and residences			1
currently , far too many students in @entity2 remain unprotected			1
a survey commissioned by the office of @entity2 rep. @entity111 , a @entity80 who favors statewide shelter funding , found more than 60 % of the 1,804 public schools surveyed in @entity2 say they do not have a shelter or safe room			1
that leaves more than 500,000 students and staff in the state without shelter			0
efforts to improve school safety often have been criticized as overly expensive			0
the @entity124 , an architectural firm that analyzed the survey , estimated it would cost up to $ 880 million to put safe rooms in the 1,109 unprotected schools			1
related : one block , two storms as @entity1 and others see it , however , that money would save lives			0
and she 's not demanding all the improvements be made at once			1
when we met on sunday afternoon , @entity1 arrived on crutches and was wearing the same leopard - print blouse she wore the day the tornado tore through central @entity2 , taking her son 's life and those of 23 others			1
we spent much of our time talking about her @entity1 -- about how he was larger than life , both in terms of his cheery disposition and because of a disorder that caused him to grow at an unnatural rate			2
as an infant , he was " all arms and legs , " impossible to contain			0
by third grade , @entity1 was 5 - foot - 6 and already dreaming big			2
he wanted to play football at @entity156 -- wanted eventually to work as a fireman			0
" he was so loving and vibrant and full of life			2
" and he was too tall to fit into a child 's casket , she told me			2
when the tornado warnings came on may 20 , 2013 , @entity1 did n't think much of it			2
she 'd lived through another killer tornado that hit central @entity2 in 1999			1
she lost her house in that storm , which was located in a neighboring suburb of @entity169			2
she decided to rebuild in @entity0 , she told me , because it had been at the epicenter of that 1999 storm			2
she figured storms that big would n't hit twice			0
related : remembering the victims she would never be so shortsighted again			0
the year since the tornado has been a " living hell			1
" she 's lost 40 pounds from stress and says her husband has gained that many			2
she does n't sleep through the night			0
her 12 - year - old son gets panicky any time the sky is cloudy , as it was on sunday , or the wind blows hard , as it does almost every day in the @entity184			1
the depths of her sorrow are almost impossible to explain			0
" when a mother has a child , that is a little bit of her running around outside " in the world , she said			2
" outside of her body is this little piece of your heart			0
... " that was a part of me			0
" her coping mechanism has been to push for change			0
@entity204 up with how little was happening to put shelters in schools , the mother and former school worker decided she 's going to run for the state @entity208 as a @entity69			1
the campaign actually is the reason she 's on crutches			2
she broke her foot stumbling on a tree root , she said , while she was putting up campaign signs in the zone hit by the tornado			2
the @entity69 primary will be held in june			0
@entity1 never planned to be a politician , and does n't like the attention of speaking so often in public about these issues , she told me			0
but maybe what the state legislature needs is a mom			0
" we have misguided ourselves into thinking it 's not going to happen to us , " she said			2
but the state needs to wake up and realize is that it can and will happen again			0
after the storm , @entity1 considered leaving @entity0 , avoiding it all			2
but she thought about her kids -- and others across the state			0
" i wanted to prove to my children -- just like my daddy taught me -- if a horse kicks you off , you get back on , " said @entity1 , who grew up on a farm			0
" i wanted them to understand this town did not kill their brother			0
" this mom , who describes herself as " competitive as snot , " does n't plan to quit pushing for greater access to tornado shelters , whether she wins the race or not			1
she has the legacy of a hero to protect			0
and the state would be wise to listen .			0

it 's been one year since a tornado killed 24 people in central @entity2
