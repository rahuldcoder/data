@entity0 , a @entity1 relative convicted of the 1975 murder of a 15 - year - old neighbor , walked out of a @entity5 courthouse thursday on bail			1
a @entity5 judge set bail at $ 1.2 million for @entity0 , whose murder conviction in the death of @entity0 was vacated last month after a judge decided he did not receive adequate representation in his 2002 trial			1
after bail was posted , @entity0 sauntered out of the courthouse , flanked by his attorneys , a slight grin on his face			1
@entity16 , his attorney , told reporters that " two tragedies " occurred in @entity18 nearly four decades ago			0
" the first was of course the murder of @entity0 , " he said			1
" a great tragedy for the @entity0 family and for everyone else associated with the matter			2
the second tragedy occurred in a courthouse ... in 2002 when @entity0 was convicted of the murder of @entity0			1
a murder he did not commit			0
and hopefully we are at the first step of righting that wrong and making sure that an innocent man now goes free			0
" @entity35 judge @entity34 set several conditions for the bail , including barring @entity0 from leaving @entity5 without court approval , ordering him to wear a gps tracking device , to refrain from contacting the victim 's family , and requiring that he report to a bail commissioner			1
@entity0 , the 53 - year - old nephew of @entity43 and @entity1 , has spent more than a decade in prison for the murder of the 15 - year - old girl			1
moments after bail was granted , about two dozen relatives of @entity0 , seated together on one side of the courtroom , applauded the decision			1
@entity0 turned to them , placed his right hand to his heart and smiled			2
in a statement , the @entity0 family said the decision was a " first step in correcting a terrible wrong			2
" " we look forward to @entity0 being vindicated and justice finally being served , " said the statement			2
" we are thankful to @entity63 that after 11 and one half years he will be reunited with his sons			0
we are grateful for the love and prayers of @entity0 's many supporters who have sustained him through this ordeal			2
" outside court , the victim 's ailing mother , @entity69 , said she was " disappointed			1
" " it 's been a little over 11 years now " since @entity0 was convicted , she said			1
" the whole thing did n't have to be this way , but i think it 's a lesson to parents			0
if your child does something wrong , face up to it			0
... i 'm disappointed , but this is life			0
" she added , " i do n't think he was a @entity83 or one of the mass murderers ... he was just a kid who had problems			0
we do n't have anything to be afraid of now			0
" earlier , prosecutor @entity88 said a bail of $ 500,000 or even $ 1 million was inappropriate and on the " low side , " given the brutal nature of the crime , the age of the victim and @entity0 's admitted mental health issues			1
in court , @entity16 cited his client 's " track record " of appearing in court			0
he said @entity0 never got a fair trial because of the " circus atmosphere " that surrounded the case , and questioned the quality of state 's evidence and testimony in securing a conviction			0
the defense filed court papers describing @entity0 as a former world - class skier , noting his work with @entity111 , and even citing a meeting he once had with the @entity113			2
" he 's one of the most recognizable faces in @entity115 , " @entity16 said			0
" he 's not going anywhere			0
" @entity118 judge @entity117 overturned @entity0 's conviction last month , ruling that defense attorney @entity121 's representation of @entity0 at his murder trial was " constitutionally deficient			1
" @entity0 's body was found in 1975 after a night of partying with @entity0 , his older brother @entity125 and other teenagers in an affluent gated community in @entity18 , @entity5			2
authorities said the 15 - year - old was bludgeoned and stabbed to death ; a broken golf club was found near her body			1
@entity0 has always proclaimed his innocence .			0
