@entity0 -- do you ever get the feeling you are being watched ? closed circuit cameras recording your movements , strange noises on the phone line , phone calls that suddenly stop , emails being monitored , and private computer files and @entity11 being hacked into			2
oh yes , secrecy is no secret in @entity14			1
privacy is anything but private			2
as human rights activists , artists , dissidents , lawyers and journalists can attest to , if the long arm of the @entity14 state wants to get you , it can			1
but it is n't only the authorities that people in @entity14 need to fear -- they may want to be wary of each other			1
a neighbor , a boss , a former friend ... anyone is a suspect , anyone can be a so - called " cyber cannibal			1
" these online stalkers unite in a virtual manhunt or so - called " @entity37 " to target perceived wrong - doers			1
they scour the web -- blogs , forums , anywhere personal information can be found -- peering into the deepest corners of someone 's life , literally eating their privacy , revealing all secrets to exact their brand of punishment			2
one admitted cyber cannibal told @entity1 he was part of a group that outed a so - called cat killer , a woman who allegedly posted pictures of herself on the net , torturing the animals			1
her case captured widespread media attention			2
" this is the cat - abusing model			1
after being human flesh searched , she shunned media all together			0
she could no longer live a normal life ... had to cut off from most social activities			0
she could no longer show up in public , " he told us			2
@entity72 can tell you all about the cyber cannibals ' devastating reach			1
the @entity0 television director has had his life turned inside out			0
his phone number , personal photos , where he works and even the identity of his parents and friends , are now public knowledge			0
he has been abused in the vilest language via email , he is harassed day and night with hateful phone calls			2
now this once confident , sharply dressed , successful young man is reduced to hiding , wearing a mask in public for fear of being recognized			2
" my life has really been messed up in the past month , " he said			0
" i received too many emails , they phone me at all hours , people abuse me ... they use dirty words			0
" opening his computer , he showed me page after page of abuse			0
some of it is directed at his parents -- especially his mother who is targeted with crude sexual taunts			0
@entity72 says it all started when he crossed a famous @entity14 pop star , @entity105			1
he says he made a light - hearted jibe about @entity105 ona popular microblog -- a @entity14 version of @entity109			1
within hours the singer 's fans went into a frenzy			0
he does n't accuse @entity105 of inciting the hatred , and her management has declined @entity1 's requests for comment			1
but @entity72 's personal life has now gone viral			1
" every day , @entity105 's fans come and post nasty words from morning to night non-stop			0
my life and work was affected , " he said			0
film maker @entity124 has made a documentary about the phenomenon			1
he called it the " invisible killer , " something he says taps into a deep - seated desire for vengeance , to get back at the world			1
" i guess they are composed mainly of two kinds of people -- those who had tough luck with life themselves and thus hold grudges against others			0
they want to get even , " he said			0
the @entity144 falls through the legal cracks in @entity14			1
it is not outlawed , yet @entity14 courts have described it as a dangerous phenomenon that undermines privacy laws			1
@entity124 says some are motivated by good , using it to uncover corruption and to highlight injustice			1
but he says too many others are out to destroy lives			0
" it can easily go too far , " he said			0
" if anyone wants to ruin another person 's reputation he can simply make up things and ask others to ' human flesh search ' for him			0
i know another case in which a boy searched for his ex-girlfriend after breaking up			0
after knowing her whereabouts , he went to find her and then killed her			0
" when we go out with @entity72 he dons his mask			2
this is how he lives now , afraid of being recognized and abused , still paying the price , he says , for crossing the pop star 's fans			1
" i 'm afraid that @entity105 's fans might attack			2
they 've attacked me twice now so i 'm scared			0
so i wear a mask to prevent them from recognizing me			0
" but on the web there is nowhere to hide from the prying eyes of @entity14 's cyber cannibals .			1
