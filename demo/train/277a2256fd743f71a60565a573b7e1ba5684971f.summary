on the swoop of the @entity4 hill ski jump , it was a case of anything you can do , i can do better			2
when @entity9 soared a massive 250 meters ( 820 feet ) to set a new ski jumping world record in @entity11 on saturday , he must have been confident the record would stand for some time			1
after all , the previous mark had been in the record books for four years and @entity15 had soared 3.5 meters ( 11 feet ) further than that			1
but the @entity17 had barely had a chance to celebrate his place in the annals of ski jumping history when his best effort was eclipsed by @entity11 rival @entity26			1
the 23 - year - old nudged the record leap another 1.5 meters ( 5 feet ) further sunday at the same venue			1
in quotes carried by the @entity33 website afterward , @entity26 said : " i thought it would not be possible to jump longer than 250m			2
then i saw @entity36 's jump on 254m [ in qualifying which he was not able to make stand ]			0
" the conditions were perfect for long flights and i made the best jump of my life			0
" it was , however , not enough for the victory , his second jump coming up some way short of the initial mark and @entity49 won the @entity50 instead			0
earlier in the weekend , @entity15 had been the first non-scandinanvian since @entity52 's @entity51 15 years ago to set the record			1
at the time , @entity9 had said : " it 's always great to jump far			2
this win today and the world record is my biggest success so far			1
" the speed and the position was perfect then i just landed			0
right now , it 's hard to describe my feelings , it will probably take a few days			0
" but @entity15 did not have those few days to dwell on his historic landing as @entity65 wrestled back the record courtesy of @entity67 .			0
