-- from 1976 to 1985 the @entity1 were awesome			1
they had one of the best hitters in the game			2
they had sharp young pitchers			2
they were a part of almost every october			0
but the 1985 @entity9 comeback win over the @entity10 was the @entity1 ' last taste of glory until wednesday , when this year 's team rumbled back into the @entity9 , sweeping the @entity14 to win the @entity15			1
for much of the past 29 years , the @entity1 have n't been a baseball afterthought , they 've been a non-thought , except for their loyal fans			1
there 's plenty of room on the @entity1 bandwagon , so if you 're thinking about getting on , here are five things to consider : they 're not baseball royalty if asked to name one @entity29 , most people would say @entity30			1
if asked to name a current royal , most people would be silent			0
but do n't be too embarrassed , this is a team that does n't have any huge stars			0
they do n't even have many celebrity fans			0
we think they have one -- actor @entity40			0
they do n't make splashy news in the free agent market			0
they built a great team through some smart draft picks and augmented the roster through a few nifty trades			0
but none of the names in the lineup stands out to people who do n't closely follow the game			2
seriously , had you heard of @entity55 until october ? ( he was the most valuable player of the @entity15 , by the way ) they can pick it it seems like you ca n't hit a ball where the @entity1 ai n't			1
on wednesday , the @entity14 smoked four balls in the first two innings right on the nose			2
every one was turned into an out			0
the game was punctuated by a great catch by @entity68 , who slammed into the left - field wall just after his glove swallowed the ball			1
before the season , a whole lot of experts said the @entity1 had some of the best fielders in the majors , but then they made a 104 errors , including a stretch of 35 in 35 games			1
so far they 've had far more great plays than errors ( just three in eight games ) in a tense and tight postseason			2
they believe the @entity1 have n't lost in the post season since 1985			1
well , that 's in part because they have n't been in the playoffs since 1985 when they won the last three against the @entity10 to win the @entity9 , four games to three			1
but check this , they 've won 11 straight games in the postseason			1
all eight this year , most of them of the nail - biting , got ta - get - a - clutch - hit variety			2
they were four runs down and six outs from being bounced out of the playoffs before it really even started			0
but they rallied to beat the @entity102 in extra innings in a thrilling wild card game and dispatched the highly favored @entity105 with two extra-innings wins and a rare ho - hum easy " w " in the division series			1
they swept the @entity14 in four but they only outscored them by six runs			0
it helps the offense to know the bullpen is going to lock it down so all they have to do is keep it close , third baseman @entity111 said			0
" this team just does n't panic , " he said			0
they just have fun @entity121 knows			0
former royal @entity122 says the kids on this team are a joy to watch			0
" it 's been a long time since i 've seen professional athletes have fun and enjoy the heck out of coming to work every day , " he told sports host @entity126 this week			1
the lack of outward happiness could stem from the huge money that puts pressure on players to perform , he said			0
well , the not - so - regally compensated @entity1 -- they are 18th out of 30 teams in the majors in payroll at $ 91 million -- do n't take the field with high expectations or a lot of pressure			1
this team has been rebuilding and manager @entity144 accepts stumbles that come with a youthful team			0
" to watch them go through the last couple of years , the ups and the downs and to finally get to this point , i am very proud of them , " he said			0
they are due it was about a decade ago that the @entity1 lost 310 games in three years			1
it would n't even be june yet and @entity1 fans were already ready to give up			1
you never knew who the @entity1 fans were in your office because they never had anything to brag on			2
it 's been 29 years since their team had won a playoff game , let alone go to the @entity9			1
sure , there are teams with longer droughts , but these @entity1 are the likeable and plucky underdogs who just ca n't seem to be bothered with losing			2
@entity0 's @entity169 contributed to this report .			2

the @entity1 *clinched* a spot in the @entity9 on wednesday night
it 's the first time they 've done that since 1985
they 're riding an 11 - game win streak going into the @entity9
