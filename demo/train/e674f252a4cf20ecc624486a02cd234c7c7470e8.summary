former @entity2 gov. @entity1 has decided to " actively explore " a presidential bid after conversations with his family over @entity7 , he said in a @entity9 post tuesday			1
while @entity1 had been making steps toward a presidential bid with recent speeches in early primary states and plans to release documents from his time period as governor , the timing of tuesday 's announcement was widely unexpected and will quicken the pace for some would - be @entity22 primary challengers			1
in the post , @entity1 writes that over the holiday he " talked about the future of the nation " with his family			2
" as a result of these conversations and thoughtful consideration of the kind of strong leadership i think @entity32 needs , i have decided to actively explore the possibility of running for @entity34 , " he said			0
@entity1 has been moving toward a run for months and in recent days sparked renewed speculation over his plans with a visit to the all - important early primary state of @entity40 to give a commencement speech monday , and his comments in a sunday interview that he felt he " would be a good president			1
" related : @entity1 to grads : ' shake things up ' democrats scoffed at his announcement			1
@entity50 spokesman @entity49 suggested it was simply meant to draw press , but dismissed the possibility of a @entity1 run either way			1
" i do n't know what the difference is between ' thinking about ' running and ' actively exploring ' running , but i suspect it has a lot to do with keeping his name in the news , " @entity49 said			1
" however you see it , there 's no parsing this simple fact : @entity1 has fully embraced the failed economic agenda that benefits only a select few at the expense of the middle class			1
that 's not going to change no matter how many different ways he says he may run			2
" @entity1 's announcement is sure to speed up the timeline for many other potential @entity22 presidential contenders on whether to jump in as well			1
@entity1 is seen as a top pick for establishment republicans hoping to encourage the party to nominate a candidate they see as most electable on the national stage			0
many observers believe if @entity1 jumps in the race , @entity2 sen. @entity83 — who 's been mentored by @entity1 since his entry into @entity2 politics — would n't run			1
and he 'd likely make it tougher for some of the more establishment - minded governors , like @entity91 gov. @entity90 or @entity93 gov. @entity92 , to find footing in the race			0
however , a source near @entity83 said tuesday that while @entity1 's announcement changes the dynamic of the race , the junior @entity2 senator is still " on track to run for president " in 2016			1
and @entity104 sen. @entity103 , who has been actively preparing for a bid and would likely run to @entity1 's right flank , also seemed nonplussed by the announcement			1
" i think we 're a big tent -- we can use moderates , conservatives , libertarians — we need em all , " he told reporters walking into the @entity109			0
asked whether he could win the nomination , @entity103 demurred			0
" i think the more the merrier -- the public will determine that			0
" @entity1 added in tuesday 's post that he hopes " to visit with many of you and have a conversation about restoring the promise of @entity32 " in the coming months			1
@entity123 : 6 things to know about @entity1 @entity1 also announced the creation of a pac , which will aim to " support leaders , ideas and policies that will expand opportunity and prosperity for all @entity32			0
" he added that the @entity126 would " facilitate conversations with citizens across @entity32 to discuss the most critical challenges facing our exceptional nation			0
" on sunday , @entity1 also announced plans to release about 250,000 emails from his time in office and an upcoming e-book about his time as governor , moves seen as efforts to re-introduce @entity32 to his governing chops in preparation to emerge as a more prominent player on the national stage			2
if he does make his bid official , he 'll likely face fierce opposition from conservatives in the primary , who have long been frustrated with his advocacy for @entity155 educational standards and his support for a more moderate vision of immigration reform			0
related : @entity1 releases 250,000 emails he 's previously expressed support for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants , though he 's wavered in that support since			2
and while he 's come out in opposition to president @entity166 's executive actions on immigration , he 's also urged republicans to act on immigration reform " rather than have their heads explode			0
" that moderation on immigration reform — and his diverse family , as his wife was born in @entity176 and he speaks fluent @entity177 — have many in the @entity22 hopeful @entity1 could help the party overcome some of their deficit with @entity182 voters , which has proven to be problematic for them in national races			0
despite the likely conservative opposition , @entity1 has hinted he would n't shift to the far - right to please @entity22 primary voters if he runs			2
during the @entity189 ceo council annual meeting earlier this month , @entity1 warned that the @entity22 presidential nominee should n't " lose the primary to win the general without violating your principles			1
" the comments came as the conservative and more centrist wings of the @entity22 continue to debate a path forward for the party , with many on the right arguing former @entity22 presidential nominee @entity202 lost in 2012 because he did n't stand strong enough on conservative principles			0
but @entity202 and @entity1 , despite the conservative criticism , remain two of the most popular figures in the party , and indeed both led the recent @entity210 national poll of the potential @entity22 presidential field			2
@entity202 took 19 percent , while @entity1 came in second with 14 percent support ; with @entity202 out of the race , @entity1 would lead with 16 percent support , followed by former @entity217 gov. @entity216 with 12 percent			0
@entity218 and @entity219 contributed to this report .			0
