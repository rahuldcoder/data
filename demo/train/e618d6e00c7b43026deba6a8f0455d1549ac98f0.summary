a detention order against @entity4 founder @entity3 on sexual assault allegations should remain in place , a @entity1 judge ruled wednesday			1
@entity3 has been holed up in the @entity7 for more than two years in a bid to avoid extradition to @entity1 , where he is wanted for questioning about allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another			1
@entity3 calls the charges false and politically motivated , but has said he fears that @entity1 will transfer him to the @entity15 -- where he could face the death penalty for the work of @entity4 -- if he were charged and convicted of a crime			1
he was represented at a hearing wednesday in @entity20 by lawyers @entity22 and @entity23 , who argued that the detention order against their client should be revoked			1
but @entity20 district court judge @entity26 ruled that @entity3 was still suspected , with probable cause , of sex crimes and that his detention order should remain in place			1
@entity31 , a lawyer representing one of the women making the allegations against @entity3 , called the decision " correct and expected			2
" prosecutor @entity36 told reporters after the verdict that it was now up to the @entity40 police to enforce the arrest warrant for @entity3			0
" it is in the hands of @entity3 , who has taken refuge at the @entity46 embassy in @entity47 , whether or not he decides to leave the embassy , " she said			1
@entity36 said the warrant could remain in place until the statute of limitations takes effect -- five years for unlawful coercion and 10 years for rape			0
in court , @entity22 said the case has dragged on for too long , harming his client , and claimed there was no valid reason for the prosecutor not to agree to interrogate @entity3 in @entity47 , rather than @entity1			1
" i 've been sitting in on interrogations where the @entity63 has traveled all the way from the @entity15 to conduct interrogations			0
and if the @entity63 can travel from the @entity15 , then surely the @entity1 prosecutor can travel to @entity47 , " he said			1
@entity22 noted that @entity3 had n't gone outside for the past two years , a basic right usually granted to detainees			2
defense argues that @entity3 has political asylum the attorney also charged that his client had a right to political asylum in @entity46			1
@entity3 did make himself available for questioning once in @entity1 , @entity22 said , and when he left the country for work reasons , he had been unaware the prosecutor would want to question him again			1
@entity3 had had only sporadic contact with his then - lawyer , @entity78 , because of a very serious threat to his safety , @entity22 said			0
@entity23 said the case was in deadlock , and appealed to the court to end the stalemate			0
@entity1 authorities will not move forward with the investigation until @entity3 is in @entity1 , he said , while the defense has not been able to start its work " since we are not given all the information that the prosecution has			1
" " the detention order can not be executed , " @entity23 told the court			2
" it will not lead to @entity3 being transferred to @entity1 within the near future because of the political asylum			2
and thus , this detention order will not provide anything positive for the @entity1 state , but it will lead to more harm for @entity3			1
" prosecutor @entity101 , speaking on behalf of the prosecution authority , said the detention order should remain in place			1
there are sufficient grounds to believe @entity3 could be found guilty of the allegations against him , she said , and his evasion risk remains the same			0
@entity101 told the court @entity3 had intentionally stayed away and had no intention of appearing for questioning in @entity1			2
the prosecution does not want to question @entity3 in @entity47 because of the nature of the crimes , and because it would be difficult to get all the necessary evidence if it had to be done via another country 's judicial system , @entity101 said			2
she also rejected his claim that the defense had not been given access to all the relevant evidence against him			0
it is " likely " but not certain that @entity3 would be indicted after questioning , the prosecution told the court			0
however , the prosecution intends to go forward with the case			0
@entity4 vows an appeal the prosecution presented evidence that would constitute probable cause for the case against @entity3 behind closed doors , in order not to interfere with the investigation			1
the prosecution 's written statement to the court rejected the claim that @entity3 's lawyer was unaware he was wanted for further questioning			0
a representative for the lawyer for the two alleged victims was also present in court			0
@entity144 , a @entity4 spokesman , expressed disappointment after the court 's verdict			0
" i had been moderately hopeful , but this did n't come as a surprise , " @entity144 said			0
" now we will appeal and we hope the higher court will reconsider all the solid arguments we have presented			0
this has to come to an end			0
" @entity3 rocketed to international fame , and infamy , in 2010 after @entity4 began helping publish secret government documents online			2
@entity46 granted @entity3 asylum in june 2012 and he fled to the country 's embassy in @entity47 to avoid extradition			1
@entity3 to @entity162 : we 're all being watched			0
