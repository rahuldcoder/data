-- @entity1 is helping to create positive change for underprivileged children , adults and military families			1
in 2009 , he started @entity6 , which provides and supports education and health programs for those in need			1
the group also increases awareness about kidney disease and organ donation			1
@entity1 underwent a kidney transplant in 2005			1
@entity1 was a presenter at " @entity16 : an all - star tribute " in 2009			2
@entity0 's @entity19 recently spoke with him about @entity16 and his own charity 's efforts			0
below are excerpts from that interview			0
@entity19 : how do you feel about the work that the @entity16 are doing ? @entity1 : for people who are in show business , so many times we get rewarded for being in a movie or being in a television show			1
but these are the unsung heroes who are out there , rain or shine			0
nothing is more powerful to them but to help			0
the one thing that connects all the heroes is their intent is to help			0
and it 's almost like hands across the world : you 're touching people that need help in your area , but yet it 's bigger than that -- it 's global			2
it 's what people do to maintain our humanity			2
@entity58 : what prompted you to start the @entity6 ? @entity1 : i received my kidney transplant six years ago and have been healthier than i have ever been in my life			1
and it 's inspired me to give back and to create the foundation and to make a difference in the lives of those people in need			2
i started @entity69 in december of 2009 , and the mission is to create positive and permanent change for underprivileged children , adults and , very importantly , military families , as well as increasing the awareness of kidney disease and organ donation			1
@entity58 : what 's rewarding about your work with the foundation ? @entity1 : when i have the kidney camp , it 's always the highlight			1
i have a summer camp , and it 's amazing to see how children will respond when they 're given the opportunity to just be regular kids			2
they get to run into kids who are also experiencing the same issues that they have , whether it 's dialysis or kidney disease			1
they talk about taking their medicine			0
they also realize that whether they are the only person sick in their family or their school , they are not alone			0
@entity58 : you support @entity16 @entity105 and his efforts to feed the hungry			0
what is it about his work that moved you ? @entity1 : people who are homeless ... they 're not all addicts			1
a lot of times , they 're just people who , through something like losing their job or losing someone in their life , ended up on the streets			0
so much of our time is spent in cars that sometimes you need to look out of those windows			0
and you see that a dollar , 50 cents , whatever you have , may not mean much to you , but it means everything to people who are hungry and who are in need .			0
