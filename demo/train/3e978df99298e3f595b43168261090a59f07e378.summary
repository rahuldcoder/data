@entity1 , @entity0 -- getting " out of this world " with civilian space travel is not quite as simple as you may think			2
ready for launch : video game programmer @entity7 shown in training for his space flight in october			1
aside from the obvious financial limitations which restrict space tourism to the rich and the ridiculously rich , there are also significant training programs and testing to be completed before proceeding to lift - off			1
to gain a better insight into this training , well - known video game programmer and designer @entity7 , who is preparing for his own space adventure in october , is detailing in a blog what he and others have to go through in order to make it into orbit as a space traveler			1
@entity7 has been in training since the beginning of the year and told @entity2 the first major thing to surprise him was the intensity of preparations			1
" when i first came here in january , i thought nine months to get trained for this is going to be plenty of time			0
of course , very quickly , i realized that i had signed up for a very complex task , something much more difficult that i had anticipated			0
i immediately knew that nine months was going to be a lot of work to get everything prepared for the flight			0
" and now that i am so close to the flight , i am still feeling the pressure , i definitively have been working very long days and most nights , " @entity7 said			1
the training regime has three major strands : physical training , which includes preparation to acclimatize to the space environment ; practical training for day - to - day living in space ; and like any flight , be it 10 minutes or 10 days , training in safety procedures for emergency situations			1
trainees generally spend nine months or more on and off - site to complete the requirements , which include everything from flight simulations to learning how to use the toilet			1
@entity62 , president and ceo of @entity64 , the company sending @entity7 into space , told @entity2 the training program is extensive , but does not exclude people from making the flight			1
" their total training program is a few months , but we tend to spread it out so they can fit it around their normal lives			2
they are not training to the same degree as the professionals			2
" as long as space hopefuls are in reasonable health , they can usually go ahead with their adventure , he said			2
" there 's some fitness involved			0
there are certainly [ medical ] things that are not allowable in space , but they are generally more serious conditions			2
" he said the major fitness issue with space travel was preparing for the change in " @entity94			0
" " the body is designed to live on one ' g , ' so when you expose it to higher ' @entity94 ' it has an effect			0
with the training and given the [ short ] length of the visits there 's a minimal effect on the body			0
" in his blog on the training process , @entity7 said one part of the training was indisputably the worst			1
" hardest of all was the ' @entity110			0
' i ca n't imagine that i will ever again voluntarily sit in a device designed to make you sick , or ride it as long as i can			1
ugh , this is definitely my least favorite part of training ! " despite such disturbing preparations , @entity62 said much of the training , which takes place at @entity64 ' base in @entity120 , @entity121 , is centered upon general living in space			1
" there 's a few requirements about what you need to know to live in the space station ... how to eat , how to drink , and how to use the restroom , for example , " he said			0
" there 's also a lot of simulation you go through ... there 's preparation to acclimatize you to the space environment			2
" @entity7 said many of the procedures for living in space , or for emergencies , are very complex			1
" there are a lot of technical details behind all the different systems we need to understand ... fire detection and alarms , plus procedures and equipment for dealing with fire emergencies ; protective breathing apparatus in case of chamber decompression or malfunction ; the toilet ( everybody 's favorite piece of space trivia ! ) , including powering up the can for suction and waste removal ; and lastly , onboard water sources			2
" he admits the learning requirements had him preparing for exams by " cramming like any good college kid			0
" and the most fascinating part of the training ? in @entity7 's opinion , it was running in a hypobaric chamber , where the altitude was set at 10,000 meters ( about 2,000 meters higher than @entity172 )			1
" i felt no physical or mental problems , but i did notice an odd physiological issue that is quite hard to describe			0
basically , it was possible to make a tennis ball - sized pocket in my mouth , but one which had no air in it as it was just a vacuum ! " by that i mean try to imagine creating a cavity inside your mouth without any air bubbles and by letting in no air through your lips or throat -- it 's basically impossible at sea level because the air pressure outside your mouth pushes the air pocket closed , " he said			0
" however , at 10,000 meters the air is so much thinner that you can pull off this oral stunt without a hitch ! weird			0
" it truly is .			0

@entity7 will *fly* with @entity64 into space in october
training involves physical , practical and safety preparation
@entity7 says the toughest part is a *spinning* chair designed to make you vomit
learning to go to the toilet in space is part of the training
