-- convicted @entity4 serial killer @entity3 wo n't be eligible for parole after being classified as a " sexually violent predator , " court officials in @entity2 said wednesday			1
@entity3 was found guilty of 11 counts of aggravated murder and more than 70 other charges friday in a string of deaths of @entity2 - area women from 2007 to 2009			1
officer @entity13 , a spokesman for the @entity15 prosecutor 's office , said @entity3 's classification as a sexually violent predator guarantees that he can only receive life in prison without parole or the death penalty when the sentencing phase of his trial begins august 1			1
the jury could have recommended parole if members believed @entity3 could be rehabilitated , according to @entity26 , the @entity15 court administrator			1
during the sentencing phase , @entity3 will be able to make a statement on his own behalf without being under oath or facing cross-examination , @entity13 said			1
the defense also can call expert witnesses to discuss @entity3 's background , including his childhood and military service			1
if jurors decide to recommend death , the judge can intervene and impose a life sentence -- but if the jury recommends life , the judge can not impose a death sentence , according to @entity26			2
jurors found @entity3 guilty on a total of 84 counts , including abusing corpses and kidnapping			1
the sole not - guilty verdict came on an aggravated robbery charge			0
the convictions ended a saga that began for investigators in october 2009 with the discovery of the first two sets of victims ' remains inside @entity3 's home			1
eventually , they blamed him for the slayings of at least 11 women , ages 25 to 52			1
@entity3 had served 15 years in prison for attempted rape before being released in 2005			1
people who met him after his release described him as " a normal guy , " known locally for selling scrap metal			0
his inconspicuous two - story home sat in a dilapidated neighborhood known as @entity71 , where one in five homes was in foreclosure and at least a third of residents got food stamps , according to a 2010 study by @entity79 's @entity78 and @entity80			0
neighbors and even a city councilman had failed to realize that the stench wafting in the area around @entity3 's residence was from human flesh and not a byproduct of a nearby sausage factory			1
the disappearances of the women -- many of whom lived nearby -- went largely unnoticed for almost two years , with only four of them even being reported missing			2
many of his alleged victims struggled with drug addiction at some point in their lives , with court records showing that many resorted to stealing and prostitution to support their habits			0
in late 2008 , @entity104 told police that a man in a gray hoodie offered her beer , and when she declined , he punched her in the face several times			0
@entity110 said that he then tried to rape her , dragging her toward his home , adding that she got out only after " gouging his face			0
" police investigated @entity110 's complaint , with one police report noting blood droplets on @entity3 's walls and steps			2
but officers told @entity0 affiliate @entity121 that the case was dropped after @entity110 declined to press charges			0
six more women disappeared after her complaint			2
authorities discovered the bodies after a 36 - year - old @entity2 woman told police a story eerily similar to those of @entity110 and the woman whose 1989 account led to @entity3 's first conviction for attempted rape			2
she said he 'd invited her into his home for beer , punched her in the face , then began performing oral sex on her -- releasing her only after she promised to return the next day			0
most of the women whose remains were found in and around @entity3 's home were strangled by ligature -- which can include a string , cord or wire -- and at least one was strangled by hand , officials said			1
seven still had ligatures wrapped around their necks			0
a skull is all that remains of one victim			0
it was found wrapped in a paper bag and stuffed in a bucket in the home 's basement			0
@entity3 's lawyers have declined previous requests by @entity0 to explain their case , and the suspect has not been interviewed			2
@entity0 's @entity166 contributed to this report .			0
