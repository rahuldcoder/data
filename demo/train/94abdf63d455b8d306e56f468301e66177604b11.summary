-- for the past two seasons , @entity1 has played junior field agent @entity3 on " ncis : @entity5			1
" but the vivacious olive - skinned actress first became famous in another country : her parents ' homeland of @entity11			1
she even won the @entity14 version of " @entity15			1
" @entity1 is descended from a family of doctors			1
her father is the former resident chief of otolaryngology ( which is a fancy word for an eye , ear and throat doctor ) at @entity24 and her 92 - year - old grandfather still practices medicine			1
the family moved back to their homeland when @entity1 was 5			1
fluent in @entity11 , @entity30 and @entity31 , @entity1 moved to @entity32 at 18 to attend university and eventually made her way to @entity35 to study at the @entity36			1
in her little time off , @entity1 loves spending time with her dog and decorating her recently purchased home			1
she recently spoke with @entity0 about her show , her heritage and the advice she gets from a famous co-star			1
@entity0 : your character has a big story arc this week			1
@entity1 : we knew from season one that her father died when she was a teenager and this is the unveiling of what happened			1
she grew up never believing he had died accidentally			2
she 's always believed foul play and she 's been pursuing this her entire life			2
she gets asked , " what are you going to do when you find the guy you think did this to your dad ? are you going to shoot him ? " and she says , " well , what if i do ? " it 's a big dilemma between killing for vengeance and going the right way and dealing with things legally			2
there 's a lot of turmoil going on inside her and it affects the team			2
@entity0 : the show is really popular and yet it gets no buzz			2
do you ever feel like the redheaded stepchild ? @entity1 : ( @entity74 ) - well if i say yes , then i 'm insulting redheads			1
@entity0 : but you know what i mean			2
@entity1 : i think when it comes to buzz , and i 'm just saying this on a very general note and from what i see , it could be completely wrong , but from what i see , buzz tends to come from younger generations , people who buy the products , people who go on the @entity90 , people who go on blogs			1
the generation that watches our show seems to be a little bit of an older one and i think that might be the reason			2
i know a lot of procedurals have huge viewership yet they 're never nominated for awards			2
you never really see , as you say , a lot of buzz around them			2
@entity0 : so are you a pinup for 60 - year - old men ? @entity1 : ( @entity74 ) - whatever floats their boat			1
it 's funny , we have been nominated for a few teen choice awards and i think slowly the writers have managed to create a different appeal for a younger generation with the type of story lines , with the banter we have			2
@entity0 : your character was introduced on the original " ncis			1
" did you learn anything from the cast ? @entity1 : @entity124 was super sweet			1
he told me when you have to look at a screen , make sure your eyes are moving around			2
it makes it look like you 're looking harder			2
@entity133 ( @entity134 ) , the fact that i realized she was in an out of hair and makeup in all of 20 minutes made me go , " that 's what i 'm going to do			2
i refuse to be called in at 5 a.m. to get hair and makeup			0
i 'm an agent ; let 's keep it simple , a ponytail			1
" the way they work and support each other			0
i really like those guys , i really do			0
@entity0 : your family is @entity11 and @entity151 , which is pretty unusual			0
how many @entity151 are there , like five ? @entity1 : yes and they 're all my family ! there 's i 'd say between four - and five - hundred			1
not a lot out of 10Â½ million to 11 million people			0
my family is probably the biggest family there			0
but coming from a small community makes you want to follow the traditions of your family much more			0
@entity0 : your dad is a major pooh - bah doctor			0
was he disappointed that you wanted to become an actress ? @entity1 : i remember asking my father if he had preferred that i 'd gone into medicine and his exact words were , " are you crazy ? you have no idea what this lifestyle is like			1
it 's a dog style life , being on call , sleeping at the hospital , studying for the rest of your life because of medical developments , it 's research , it 's surgery , it 's such a long time to educate yourself in the field			1
" i do have a huge fascination for science and i love to hear what my dad has to say			0
he used to take me into minor surgeries when i was a kid and let me watch , so i definitely have a passion for it , but it 's not as big a passion as i have for acting and creating characters			0
from the moment i told them this is what i want to do , they were supportive			0
@entity0 : you were on the @entity11 version of " @entity15			0
" @entity1 : i did			1
i got a trophy , but it 's not metallic , i think its crystal			0
it 's in my place in @entity11			0
@entity0 : would you do the @entity204 version ? @entity1 : i think there are phases in your life that make sense and i do n't see being on " @entity15 " at this point in my life and career			1
i had a ton of fun , i do n't regret it , but i think i 'm past that now			0
i 'm onto other things			0
@entity0 : what do you do in your time off ? @entity1 : on my very little time off ? i just moved , so a lot of my time is dedicated to buying new furniture			1
it 's the first house i 've ever lived in			0
i 've always lived in apartments and condos , so it 's a big change for me			0
@entity0 : do you go online a lot looking at sofas ? @entity1 : i do go online a lot			1
i was given some advice by [ co-star and " @entity234 " actor ] @entity232			0
he was like , " be careful , you 're going to start buying items that you love and then you 'll put them all together and realize nothing goes together , " so what i did was buy a couple of pieces that i love and now i 'm going to get a decorator to help me tie everything together			0
@entity0 : is @entity232 your interior adviser ? @entity1 : @entity232 and @entity246 are really into real estate			1
everybody 's on the same page , they 're just a few years ahead of me			0
they 've had this experience before ; i 've never had this experience before			0
before , when i rented , i was like i 'm just going to buy cheap because i 'll get rid of it in a year or two and all of a sudden you 're buying for five to 10 years			0
@entity0 : now when your friends come over are you like , " guys get your feet off the couch ? " @entity1 : no , i have a dog so i do n't want to come home and take my shoes off [ or ] otherwise i 'll ruin the mint white carpet on the floor			1
i 'd rather have a house that 's nice but usable			0
plus my friends are n't barbarians			0
they do n't generally put their feet on my couch !			0
