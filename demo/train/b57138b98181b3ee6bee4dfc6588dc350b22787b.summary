-- it took more than five years to build , but since its opening last year , the @entity2 has become the jewel among the sprawling @entity7 megacity 's bland urban landscape			1
designed by @entity10 architect @entity9 it looks more cosmic than communist , but @entity9 has likened it to two rocks washed up from the @entity14 and deposited on its bank			1
from the smoothed corners of its asymmetrical exterior to the undulating 1,800 - seat main theater , the concept of fluidity , like the flowing river nearby , goes from inside to out			2
" i was very preoccupied at the time with things moving , " said @entity9			1
" that led to the drawings , and the drawings kind of led to distortion and deformation , and then the next influence was really landscape			0
" the building has gained plaudits from around the world and won the best cultural building award at the 2011 @entity36			0
the judges complimented the building on its internal places and external forms as well as how the asymmetry of the auditorium did not detract from the near perfect acoustics			0
in a career spanning three decades , @entity9 has built a reputation for designing seemingly unbuildable structures and the opera house 's construction explored new areas for both architect and builders			1
essential for much of the design was keeping the building in harmony with the local topography and using natural materials to counter the subtropical climate			0
the exterior envelop of the buildings combine granite and glazing , with windows angled towards the ground to minimize heat from the sun. the granite cladding -- kept 50 centimeters away from the building -- is also in place to absorb heat and ensure that the interior of the building remains cool without excessive use of air - conditioning systems			1
water from the @entity14 is also used directly in the building 's cooling systems			1
when the opera house opened reports suggested that @entity2 's humid climate and sub-standard construction led to problems with some of the granite slabs and glazing			2
the @entity2 construction group that was contracted to build the opera house told the @entity10 's @entity87 that cracks stemmed from " normal shrinkage " and any problems since opening were only because of the unexpected complexity of the project and design			2
a spokesperson for @entity96 admitted that some " superficial elements " needed adjustment post-opening , but they have since been addressed			0
despite teething problems , the opera house has transformed a once moribund area of the city into the site of one of the world 's leading architectural icons .			0
