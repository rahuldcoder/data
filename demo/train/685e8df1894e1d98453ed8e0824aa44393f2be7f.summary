" a four - star commander was relieved ultimately due to this article			0
we want to understand what happened here , " col. @entity38 said			0
the army inspector general , the service 's independent investigative arm , began the investigation shortly after president @entity31 fired the general in june , @entity38 said wednesday			0
he declined to answer questions about the scope of the review or who was being interviewed , because the investigation is ongoing			0
it is widely believed that @entity5 , as well as his closest aides , either may have already been interviewed or will be by the inspector general regarding comments in the article that could be considered denigrating to the president			1
@entity5 himself , however , is not expected to be a target of the investigation as the president has already said he did not fire the general " out of any sense of personal insult			2
" @entity31 said he was making the decision because the tone of the remarks made in the article " undermines the civilian control of the military that is at the core of our democratic system			2

the journalist wrote that an unnamed aide to @entity5 mocked vice president @entity103			0
@entity5 did not deny the article 's accuracy			1
in a statement , he called the comments " a mistake " and apologized for " poor judgment			0
" he retired june 23 and was replaced by gen. @entity110 , who was previously the top commander in @entity111			0
