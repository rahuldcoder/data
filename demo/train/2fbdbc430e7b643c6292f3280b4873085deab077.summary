-- looking for cheap airfares for your big trip abroad but suffering from search fatigue ? when all else fails , try one of these tested strategies			1
even if you 've packed your bags , being flexible on departure dates could save you money			2
strategy no.1 : start your search at @entity14 we find that meta - search site @entity14 is the all - time best place for scoring the cheapest plane tickets			1
our biggest beef with @entity14 's competitors is that , when you click to book a fare , you 're typically directed to a new page			1
sometimes it 's only then that you find out your actual departure time			0
or worse , you 're forced to plug in your dates and departure cities all over again , only to discover more - expensive fares			2
once you 've found a good flight , click on the price and you 'll be sent directly to the airline 's web site , where the exact price for the exact flight you selected unfailingly appears			0
strategy no. 2 : use fare - history charts it 's the classic dilemma : should you buy the best fare you see today or wait because the price might go down ? here 's how to come up with an educated guess			1
use @entity14 to fetch fares for your itinerary and then click on " show chart of fare history , " which is a link near the top left - hand corner of the search results			1
if the chart says that the average fare for your route is much higher than the fare you 're seeing today , then you should probably book the ticket because it 's cheap relative to historic prices			2
strategy no. 3 : monitor fares and be ready to jump plug in your dates and routes , as well as a price threshold , at a fare - tracking service , such as @entity64 or @entity66 's @entity65			1
each site will ask you to join ( free ) , and then will do several price searches per day			0
you 'll receive an e-mail alert as soon as the flight drops to your specified price			0
to name your " trigger " price , look at @entity14 's fare - history chart to see the lowest fare recorded for this route , and use an amount close to that as your baseline			1
@entity64 is the industry leader for tracking fares -- even @entity82 incorporates @entity64 's data in its search results			2
@entity66 's @entity65 is also excellent , allowing you to program automatic searches of your chosen route over a 60 - day window ( which is a nice perk and increases the chances you 'll find a bargain fare as long as you can be flexible in your travel dates )			1
there is a catch , though : while both sites cover popular routes , neither covers the entire world			0
strategy no. 4 : run a flexible - date search you may save hundreds of dollars by moving your departure or arrival dates by a day or two , either earlier or later			1
to see how much you might save , we recommend you take @entity14 's flexible - date search tool for a spin -- it covers the broadest range of routes and airports of the competing tools we tested			1
in our trials , @entity109 's flexible search came up with only the most popular routes , so your route may not qualify			2
@entity113 's flexible - date calendar gave a nice overview of fares on various days , but departure times were not initially shown			1
@entity117 provided a few different ways to search flexibly -- either within a few days of a selected date , or over selected months -- but like @entity113 it failed to show dates and departure times right away			1
finally , relative newcomer @entity123 's flexible search tool lacked a " search nearby airports " feature , which meant it gave you fares from major airports , but missed cheaper fares departing nearby			1
in short , @entity14 is your best bet for a flexible - date search			1
strategy no. 5 : book two tickets instead of one you may save hundreds of dollars if you split your international journey into different legs and buy separate tickets for each leg			1
for example , rather than buy a single ticket for direct flights between @entity140 and @entity141 for $ 1,000 , you may be able to buy two tickets -- one for a round - trip ticket between @entity140 and @entity145 for $ 200 and another for a round - trip ticket between @entity145 and @entity141 for $ 600 -- and save about $ 200			1
the quickest way to figure out if you can save by booking two tickets is to figure out if there is a hub airport that funnels most @entity152 travelers to your overseas destination			2
then , look into reserving separate tickets to and from that hub			1
for instance , @entity155 is the hub for flights to most destinations in @entity160 and the @entity161 , meaning that a majority of @entity152 flying southward internationally pass through @entity155 's airport instead of , say , either @entity164 or @entity165			0
another hub airport is @entity167 ' @entity167 , which is the main funnel for people heading to @entity170 , the @entity171 , and @entity172			0
@entity145 's airports are common layover spots for most of the planes crossing the @entity176 to @entity177 and points beyond			0
we recently tested this approach for a round - trip between @entity164 and @entity181			2
our initial searches on a few travel web sites did n't turn up any nonstop flights between the two cities , but we did find multi-stop tickets			1
@entity188 's best fare between @entity164 and @entity181 in november was $ 1,012 , with a stop in @entity167			0
if there 's a large number of flights to @entity170 passing through @entity196 , then the @entity192 might offer bargain direct flights to @entity198 -- because the greater volume of flights often prompts a greater number of fare sales			2
so we checked out fares between @entity204 and @entity181			0
it turns out they started at $ 652			0
next , we did a quick search for round - trip airfares on flights between @entity164 and @entity167			1
we found flights for $ 252 , bringing our two - flight total to $ 904 -- for a savings of 11 percent over @entity188 's flight for $ 1,012			0
if you decide to book two tickets on two different airlines , be sure to allow extra time to make your connections , and consider buying good travel insurance to make sure you 're covered in the event of a problem			0
you can save money on insurance policies by buying them directly from an insurer , such as industry giant @entity226 , rather than through a middleman , who will charge a marked - up price			0
strategy no. 6 : shift your trip to another month when all else fails and you just ca n't get the fare you want , think about off - season travel			2
in a guidebook , look up your destination 's high ( or peak ) season , low season , and in - between ( or " shoulder " ) season			0
then travel at a time when your destination is less crowded -- and travel costs are correspondingly lower			0
but do n't get rained on : before you opt for a cheaper season , you 'll want to know about the average weather , so search your guidebook ( or a site like @entity247 ) for monthly trends			0
web searches on sample itineraries will also reveal which months are cheaper to visit your destination			0
for instance , we recently discovered that fares from @entity164 to @entity170 were as much as $ 800 lower in november than in january			0
