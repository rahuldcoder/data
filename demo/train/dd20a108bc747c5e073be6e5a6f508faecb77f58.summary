-- among the entertainers who have donated their energies to the @entity3 in recent years are @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11			1
@entity4 's trip to @entity13 , facilitated by the @entity3 , was six months in the planning			1
but when the @entity3 conducts a public opinion survey asking people who they think of when the military service organization is mentioned , one name always comes up			1
" the first thing out of their mouths is ' @entity25 , ' " said @entity20 , the @entity3 's vice president for communications , with an audible shrug			1
" and if they 're not part of the military , the list stops there			0
" as the country celebrates @entity32 and pays tribute to the men and women who serve in its armed forces , the @entity3 is trying to change that mindset			1
the organization , which was founded in 1941 to bring comfort and entertainment to @entity43 's men and women in uniform , has been focusing its support on @entity43 troops stationed around the world , particularly those in the military theaters of @entity13 and @entity51 , said @entity20			1
as part of that initiative , it 's paying a great deal of attention to the troops ' desires , whether they be for high technology -- the @entity3 recently brought video game / hdtv entertainment centers and satellite - based telephone systems to some areas -- or a diversity of entertainers , including rappers and @entity69 players			1
the @entity4 trip was a meeting of the minds between the @entity74 star and the military , said @entity76 , the @entity3 's vice president for entertainment operations			1
the " @entity82 " host , who has attested to his interest in @entity13 in such venues as @entity81 ( he was a guest editor last month ) , expressed interest in going , a request that made its way up the chain of command to gen. @entity88 , the former leader of coalition forces in @entity13			1
@entity88 liked the idea , said @entity76 , and the principals were put in touch with the @entity3			1
@entity4 's excursion , which the comedian called " @entity95 , " was unusual for the @entity3 , she added			1
" we try to keep our footprint small , " she said , noting that the organization is reliant on the military to feed and house its guests			2
in " @entity4 's " case , the footprint was considerably larger : @entity4 's staff and several @entity3 employees -- not to mention 150 volunteers			1
the trip required six months of planning			0
but the broadcasts went well , with @entity4 paying tribute to the military and the @entity3 's volunteers ( as well as his own staff ) on the " report			1
" he also put in a plug for @entity3 donations : " the @entity3 does more than bring my show to @entity116 , " @entity4 said on the show			1
" they also deliver much - needed care packages to the troops			2
" ( @entity122 , in a care - package primer , @entity4 and @entity120 filled a box with shaving gel , @entity125 and a demolished ice sculpture			0
) the group remains greatly dependent on the kindness of strangers , said @entity130			2
" we 're primarily a volunteer organization , " he said , noting the @entity3 has fewer than 400 paid employees and 25,000 volunteers			1
though the @entity3 does receive a small congressional appropriation -- $ 20 million in 2008 -- much of its funding comes from individuals , corporations and in the form of in - kind services			1
@entity140 , the owner of @entity143 ' @entity142 comedy club , said the organization is close to his heart			0
he followed a tour of @entity142 comedians with an invitation to service members to visit his club			0
" what we try to do is give the soldiers -- the people that are out there putting their lives on the line for our country ... we try to say , one day if you come to @entity143 , if you want to be a comedian , our door is open to you			0
we want you to send us some material , some jokes , " he said			0
at a recent @entity3 fundraiser , five service members were given the opportunity to compete for the title of " funniest service member			2
" the group was given advice from several notable comedians , including @entity172 and @entity173 , and the winner received cash , gift certificates and a performance at the club , complete with name on the marquee			0
a number of performers return again and again			0
@entity9 has gone on at least seven @entity3 tours ; " he insists on going to the smallest , most remote places , " said @entity20			2
actor @entity186 and his lt. @entity187 are also frequent participants			0
" there are n't enough words to describe just how grateful i am to our nation 's troops , " said @entity9 in a press release before this year 's tour			0
" i 've participated in several @entity3 tours over the years and i 've seen firsthand their sacrifice			2
and i will not stop doing all i can to show my support and lift their spirits			0
" many entertainers shy away from publicity , particularly on the home front			0
" we have celebrities come to @entity205 , @entity206 ... and they almost always insist we do n't talk about [ the visits ] , " said @entity76			0
at its core , @entity20 said , the @entity3 remains dedicated to the needs of @entity43 service members			2
" service members in @entity13 and @entity51 are frequently at small , remote bases , " said @entity20			2
" there 's little in the way of creature comforts			0
those are the things we try to deliver			0

@entity3 often brings thoughts of @entity25 , but organization well beyond that
group offers technology , entertainment to troops *overseas*
@entity3 played key role in arranging " @entity82 " from @entity13
