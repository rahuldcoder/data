-- modern communications are an essential foundation for the social and economic opportunities that everyone deserves			1
the @entity6 on @entity7 ( @entity8 ) , currently taking place in @entity10 , is a golden opportunity to provide affordable connectivity for all , including the billions of people worldwide who can not yet go online			1
it is our chance to chart a globally - agreed roadmap to connect the unconnected , while ensuring there is investment to create the infrastructure needed for the exponential growth in voice , video and data traffic			1
the conference is a landmark because , for the first time in a quarter - century , it is reviewing the @entity29 ( @entity30 ) that govern international connectivity			1
not surprisingly , there are many differing ideas about how this might be done , as well as hot debate on some proposals that have been put forward			1
there are 193 member countries of @entity39 , and all are free to express their views			2
however , no proposal to @entity8 will be accepted unless it has very broad support			2
but there are more voices at @entity8 than just those of government			2
the ceo of @entity49 , @entity48 , addressed the opening ceremony and emphasized the growing cooperation between his organization and @entity39			2
and included among national delegations are dozens of representatives from industry and civil society			2

much of the conference itself is webcast			2
@entity8 is not a " closed - door " event			1
in fact , compared with other intergovernmental meetings of such importance , @entity8 is as open as it possibly can be			2
@entity39 has always sought a multi-stakeholder approach			2
in 2003 and 2005 we led the way with the @entity81 , which -- for the first time -- brought all sides together to debate how transformational information and communication technologies ( @entity86 ) should shape the future			0
we expect the same kind of constructive cooperation to occur at @entity8			0
it is crucial that the @entity91 is not only kept open for business , but is also opened for everyone			0
we can then continue to innovate and gain the vast benefits that result from access to knowledge			1

this is permitted under articles in the @entity107 , which is part of the @entity109 , and in the @entity110			1
however , these are exceptions to the basic principle enshrined in those documents : the right to freedom of expression and communication			0
the @entity30 must conform to the @entity118 , and nothing in the revised treaty can diminish that fundamental right to free speech			0

at present , two - thirds of people globally have no internet access , and far fewer benefit from broadband			1
this is often forgotten by the other third , but the stark truth is that @entity91 is still a privilege of the minority			1
i spoke out recently when internet access was shut down in @entity141 amid understandable outcry			1
what mostly went unreported is that 80 % of @entity141 never had access to the internet in the first place			1
this underscores our need to prioritize giving people access to @entity86			1
the solution requires partnership between the public and private sectors , within frameworks that encourage innovation alongside investment in areas where it is needed most			0
considering measures to achieve this is one of the most important items on @entity8 's agenda			0
more details of all major topics are available via the @entity39 website			0
@entity39 's development of technical standards , alongside the work of others , has played a key role in enabling connectivity and interoperability in today 's powerful technologies of mobile including optical fiber , television , video compression , mobile , broadband and @entity91			0
i believe that broadband in particular can be the engine that drives progress , but without @entity39 standards on , for example , transport mechanisms to carry information around the world , broadband services simply would not work			0
the telecommunications system that enables our networked society is global , and solutions to issues such as cybersecurity must be global too			0
we must meet the challenge posed by the massive growth in data traffic that is not yet matched by infrastructure development			0
and many believe there should be a level playing field at national and international levels , to avoid abuse of power by dominant players			0
@entity8 is where such questions can start to be openly discussed and answered			0
it is a world conference and a unique meeting place where issues can be debated that will have an immense impact on our lives			1
what is at stake is whether we advance together towards a truly connected world , or instead contemplate a deepening digital divide with all its consequences			0
we can not afford to miss the opportunities presented by @entity8			0
through dialogue , compromise and cooperation , the conference can help lead us towards a knowledge society in which people everywhere , whatever their circumstances , can access , use , share and create data in an affordable and secure manner			1
that is what @entity8 is about .			0
