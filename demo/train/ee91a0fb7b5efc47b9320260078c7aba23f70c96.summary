-- @entity1 got a nod for best actress from the @entity4 this year for her role as @entity6 in " the help , " and she must win , despite the controversy about the movie and the role she plays in it			1
if you believe what you read on blogs , black women long to be represented on screens large and small as rounded , complex characters , rather than wise , downtrodden burden - bearers and hot - blooded angry sex machines			1
some say they want more black people telling black stories , which would be reasonable , if it were true			1
i have been black a long time , and i can tell you that black folks are a persnickety lot			1
to get consensus , things have to be done @entity29 -- but there 's no consensus on what that looks like			0
however , we seem to know what it is not			0
@entity46 ' " @entity45 " and " precious " contained the wrong message ( white people saving black people ) and " @entity44 " was tainted by @entity39 , a gifted director and storyteller given to more commercial fare , whom some saw as the wrong messenger			2
the @entity47 of @entity48 rarely agree on anything			0
one thing is certain -- @entity51 takes on a difficult role and breathes life into a hero who is inspiring , enraging , familiar and extraordinary			1
it is odious that the nominating committee gravitates to black people playing into conventional stereotypes			2
nevertheless , that is not @entity1 ' fault			1
given the @entity62 , i think most any actor would be lucky to get work as a tree , forget about the layered role of a conflicted domestic in @entity70 's civil rights - era @entity68			2
it is an incredible part , and @entity51 nails it			1
not everyone is happy about that			0
you may recall that back when the film was released in theaters , the aforementioned @entity47 espoused their disgust for a black woman acting as a domestic , which naturally made white audiences curious , turning both the movie and the novel it was based on into something of a sensation			2
i 'm not sure why white folks loved " @entity87 " so much -- maybe because many of them grew up with an @entity6 of their own			0
films outside the comfort zone of mainstream black audiences seem to attract mainstream patronage en masse			2
not that it matters , but from " @entity100 " to " @entity96 " and " glory , " black outrage often translates to box - office gold			2
maybe mainstream audiences are more willing to confront difficult stories objectively , as opposed to bringing all their discontent and political baggage and such while shouting expletives at the movie screen			0
i do n't know what some black folks want from a film -- the @entity111 machine is an ugly marriage of art and business , propaganda and entertainment			0
people going to the cineplex in search of edification or some ethereal , cathartic moment of spiritual actualization should be in school or church -- because they expect more than they reasonably should from a movie			0
author @entity126 once referred to her novel as " civil rights fiction , " which sounds more like bad @entity131 coaching than a claim to take too seriously			0
the film , like the novel , is not about civil rights -- it is about prejudice , privilege and the price of dignity			0
it is about the things you learn about people when you step out of your comfort zone			0
the actress @entity146 does her part , but @entity1 carries this film on her back			1
some may be discouraged to see a black woman get an @entity4 nod for playing a house cleaner -- never mind that women in their 40s of every stripe are having a hard time everywhere in @entity111			1
@entity1 is a gifted actor -- smokin ' hot ! -- but not buxom , biracial or conventionally beautiful			1
she already has a truckload of @entity158 and other theater awards , just got a @entity161 award , and works steadily			0
her nomination pushes an opening door even further , soliciting an appreciation for the beauty of dark skin , full eyes and lips , and a new beauty aesthetic for @entity111 to consider			1
" @entity87 " is decried for being a work of white liberal guilt porn , schmaltzy and sentimental -- which it is			0
but so what ? there are flaws in the film , but @entity1 is not one of them			1
join the conversation on @entity180			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of jimi izrael .			1

@entity1 is nominated for an @entity4 ; jimi izrael says she must win
he says black women would like to see better roles that show them as rounded , complex
he says @entity51 ' role might be stereotypical , but she breathes life into it , makes it extraordinary
izrael : some may complain , but @entity51 may be opening the door wider for blacks in movies
