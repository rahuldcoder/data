-- ten days after a radiation leak was reported at the @entity4 outside @entity5 , @entity6 , tests on samples collected from numerous areas in the plant found " slightly elevated " levels of airborne radioactivity , the @entity2 @entity1 said			1
" these concentrations remain well below a level of public or environmental hazard , " the department said monday in a news release			1
the leak was reported on february 14 , and the samples were collected on february 17 and 18			1
dose assessment modeling of the leak " showed a potential dose of less than one millirem at each of the environmental sampling locations , " about a tenth the amount a person would receive from a chest x-ray , the release said			1
" the average person living in the @entity2 receives an annual dose of about 620 millirem from exposure to naturally occurring and other sources of radiation , " it said			0
according to its website , @entity4 " safely disposes " of the nation 's defense - related radioactive waste			2
waste shipped to @entity4 , which is 26 miles outside of @entity5 , is " permanently " disposed of in rooms mined out of a salt formation 2,150 feet ( 0.4 miles ) below the surface of the desert			1
the waste generally consists of clothing , tools , equipment , sludge , soil or other materials contaminated with man - made radioactive elements that are heavier than uranium			0
an alarm late on february 14 indicated higher than usual levels of airborne radiation and led to a first - of - its - kind response since the nuclear disposal facility began accepting waste in 1999			1
an air monitor at the plant detected the spike in an isolated area below ground , which prompted the shutoff of filtered air from the facility into the environment around it			1
" this is the first time we had to close off air filtered by the facility to the outside , " @entity1 spokesman @entity68 told @entity0 last week			2
the radiation was first detected at 11:30 p.m. , according to @entity68			0
he said the facility 's ventilation system , which monitors air quality , automatically switched to " filtration mode " when the leak was discovered			0
because of the location of the incident , @entity68 said , there was little risk to employees			0
those who were inside the above - ground area of the facility were quarantined until radiological control technicians cleared them to go home			2
" no one was underground when the alarm went off , " @entity68 said			0
" and everyone that was in the facility ( at the time ) , we know where they are and we 've tested them			0
" @entity0 's @entity101 and @entity102 contributed to this report .			0
