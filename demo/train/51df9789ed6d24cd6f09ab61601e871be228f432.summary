@entity0 -- it 's a problem that has been around for awhile , and the longer it stays , the tougher it is to reverse			1
that 's because it 's a riddle that 's almost impossible to resolve : @entity7 want the government to fix our problems , but they do n't trust the government to do it			1
we want health care to be fixed , @entity13 and @entity14 to stay intact , emergencies to be handled			1
we also want lower taxes along with a smaller — yet more responsive — government			1
all in all , we would like to spend less and get more			0
small wonder we do n't believe government can do it , because it can not			1
according to the latest @entity1 / @entity24 poll , the public 's trust in the federal government has dropped to an all - time low : only 15 % of @entity7 today say they trust the government to do what 's right just about always or most of the time — down 10 points from about a year ago			1
the last time that number was perilously close to rock bottom was in 1994 , after @entity30 lost health care reform			1
and it prompted the president to famously declare " the era of big government is over			2
" only it is n't			2
and that 's the essential conundrum for @entity38			1
he 's been a big - agenda president			2
he sees himself as transformational , so anything less would not do			0
but the more he did — economic stimulus , health care reform — the more the public recoiled			0
they did n't see the results , and hated the partisanship			2
all of which makes sense			0
even the president himself , back in 2009 , admitted he had n't laid the groundwork for his big agenda			2
after all , how can you convince the public to expand the government while most people believe it 's bloated and out of control ? " i understand that people are feeling uncertain about this			2
they feel anxious , partly because we 've just become so cynical about what government can accomplish that people 's attitudes are , you know , even though i do n't like this devil , at least i know it , and i like that more than the devil i do n't know , " the president said at a press conference in the middle of the health care debate			1
" so folks are skeptical			0
and that is entirely legitimate , because they have n't seen a lot of laws coming out of @entity0 lately that helped them			2
" all of which is true			0
but here 's where leadership comes in — and has been lacking			2
the public distrusts government because its leaders have n't been able to work together to produce much of anything			1
sure , we want it all — and that 's our fault			0
but if we had some honest politicians out there , on both sides of the aisle , saying we ca n't have it all , we just might listen to them			2
instead , we hear each side yammering about how the other guys solutions will kill the country or jobs or your bank account , so we figure we ca n't trust any of them			1
it 's perfectly reasonable to feel that way			0
in fact , i would make the argument that — after watching the debt ceiling debacle — it would be strange to feel anything other than disrespect for @entity0			0
and the more @entity115 fools with people 's lives — like playing games over emergency funding — the more the public turns off			0
and it 's not going to get any better the closer we get to an election			0
it is true that distrust of government is nothing new			0
it 's also not news that we want the government to solve our problems even though we think it 's full of scoundrels			1
" there is nothing new about this ambivalence , " scholars , and former @entity30 administration officials , @entity138 and @entity139 point out in an essay called " change you can believe in requires a government you can trust			1
" they also make this important point : it 's up to the president to lead			0
' how ... the president deals with it may make the difference between success and failure			0
" the problem for @entity38 now is that he has dealt with the problems in all ways : as the partisan and as the conciliator			1
yes , the often - recalcitrant freshmen republicans have backed him into a corner , because they refuse to deal on much of anything			0
even so , the president 's initial identity — as a change - agent who can fix @entity0 — is gone			0
@entity163 understood the public 's skepticism about government			0
he often joked that the scariest sentence in @entity7 is " i 'm from the government and i 'm here to help			1
" this president 's problem is that he wants the government to help — only he has n't been able to convince the public that government has changed			1
that 's because it has n't			0
