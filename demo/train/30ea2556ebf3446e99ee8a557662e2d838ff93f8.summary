horses have been pulling passenger carriages on @entity3 streets since 1858 , 50 years before the @entity4 was introduced , and there 's no arguing they 've been an iconic feature of the city 's culture			1
but as society evolves , so do its standards			0
when traditions become unacceptable , we do n't stick to them simply to keep money coming in			1
there is no better example of an obsolete and unacceptable tradition than @entity3 's horse - drawn carriage rides			1
in the 21st century , using horses to pull heavy loads of tourists through congested city streets is unnatural , unnecessary and an undeniable strain on the horses			1
and that strain is not restricted to the streets			1
the stables to which these horses return -- former tenement buildings -- do not afford horses a paddock for turnout , the ability to graze or the freedom to roll and run			1
that 's why , as an organization that 's fought for humane treatment of horses since our founding in 1866 , we think it 's time to end horse - drawn carriage rides , a position firmly and bravely backed by @entity3 's new mayor , @entity46			1
" we 're going to get rid of horse carriages , period , " the mayor said two days before taking office			1
no counterargument stands up to the sheer absurdity of this antiquated practice , though many who profit from it keep trying			0
opposite view : keep the beloved @entity3 carriage rides a carriage driver and industry spokesperson recently told @entity60 that only " two different sides " are arguing this issue : " the people that know about horses , and people who just look at the horses and give their first impression based on something they read on the @entity70			1
" that statement indicates a deliberate ignorance that serves neither the horses nor the truth			2
there are many perspectives on this issue , but because these carriages are profit - driven as well as horse - driven , the paramount question is " what 's in the best interest of the horses ? " and is the answer more likely to come from a group dedicated to animal rescue and protection or from horse carriage drivers teaming up with a @entity90 - based pr firm that says it is fighting " radical animal rights extremists " to protect industry ? are the concerns about lost jobs legitimate ? absolutely			1
we share those concerns and encourage new ideas to address them			2
but using fear over facts and paper - thin arguments to sway this debate is irresponsible			0
here 's a sampling of the most ridiculous points suggested by the carriage horse industry and others in the media : carriage horses have ample " vacation time			2
" this may come as news to some , but horses do n't understand the idea of workplace benefits			2
time off is no defense if the time on is degrading			0
and another key difference : if you do n't like your job , you can quit			0
these horses ' nine - hour shifts , pulling vehicles weighing hundreds of pounds through bumper - to - bumper traffic on hard pavement , go on without regard to their natural inclinations or overall well - being			1
the presence of police horses means the use of carriage horses is appropriate			2
police horses serve a public service			2
carriage horses exist for personal profit			2
that 's the difference between necessary and unnecessary			0
yes , they 're both horses -- just like police officers and ticket scalpers are both humans -- but their roles could not be more different			2
it should also be noted that @entity141 horses and officers undergo months of specialized training , while @entity3 carriage horse drivers must simply attend a two - day course and have a valid driver 's license			1
horses share our environment : if it 's good enough for us , it 's good enough for them			2
humans can get off the street , go inside , sit down and generally leave pollutants , noise , potholes and traffic behind			2
horses do n't have that luxury			0
not only that , but the official training manual for horse - drawn carriage operators cautions drivers that horses are naturally alarmed by -- among other things -- brightly colored traffic lines , manhole covers , potholes , motorcycles , ambulance and police sirens , barking dogs , and noisy crowds			1
sound like any city you know ? the number of carriage horse violations and accidents is insignificant			0
the @entity181 has issued more than 230 summonses to carriage operators since 2007			1
but just one dangerous incident or violation is one too many			0
in one of many stories of these animals panicking , a mare named @entity187 was spooked and bolted onto the sidewalk where she died of shock in 2007			0
in december , a carriage horse operator was arrested and charged with animal cruelty for working a horse that was visibly injured			0
incidents such as these should n't be tolerated , especially when the practice is so unnecessary			0
and @entity3 still needs carriage horses like it still needs subway tokens			1
if the practice ends , the horses will be destroyed or abandoned			0
we hear this false forecast all too often			0
many rescue organizations and shelters are ready and willing to find and open homes to these horses , if their owners allow it			0
the @entity181 will gladly get involved to help find and facilitate humane options for any horse in need of placement			1
but by no means does life as a carriage horse ensure the animal wo n't eventually be killed for profit			0
when their useful days are done , they may well be sent to auctions where buyers are often looking for @entity224 horses to ship to @entity225 or @entity226 for slaughter and human consumption overseas			0
this debate is a conversation @entity3 needs to have			1
but it should happen in a context of hard truth , not hyperbolic bias			0
and so do the animals with whom they share the city			0
we applaud efforts clearly in motion to take these horses off city streets , pushing both them and @entity3 itself into a more civilized future that should be welcomed , not feared .			1

@entity248 : when traditions are unacceptable , we should change them
@entity248 : horses pull hundreds of pounds through *bad* traffic on streets for nine hours
he says : lost jobs concerns are legit , so we must offer other ways for drivers to make living
@entity248 : @entity181 shares position bravely backed by @entity3 mayor @entity46
