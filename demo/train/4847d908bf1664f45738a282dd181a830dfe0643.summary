i once wondered why we indigenous peoples of @entity3 must break it down when it comes to why something is anti-native @entity7			2
on the whole , people can recognize what 's anti-black , anti-gay , @entity12 , @entity13 , and so on : but when it comes to racism directed at @entity18 , we , the first peoples of this continent , are left having to explain why @entity18 mascots and painting your face red at a @entity23 game denigrate us			1
years of studying and observing this situation have led me to an unfortunate conclusion : people have been conditioned to ignore racism directed at @entity18			1
but , i 'm not sure i can consciously blame them ... at least not all of them			2
think about it : thanks to @entity31 , i 'm supposed to have long hair , bronze skin and a very limited vocabulary			1
courtesy of @entity37 and @entity38 , it 's possible someone might believe it 's " just in good fun " to dress in faux @entity41 garb and play @entity18			1
so when i walk in a room , nobody looks at me and sees a @entity41			2
why ? because people have been conditioned to believe i look , act , and even talk a certain way , and believe playing @entity18 is ok			1
@entity48 , it 's not			2
so here 's the solution : we are going to be seen			2
as social media and the web continue to grow exponentially , so too do the voice and face of @entity41			2
the @entity56 has just launched yet another campaign to put our faces and those of our allies in the public eye			1
@entity56 's hashtag , # @entity63 , is a video and photo campaign that uses the web and demonstrates that we are more than a costume			1
we are more than a mascot			0
in fact , the second half of the campaign against the dehumanization of @entity18 in the form of sports mascots is aptly called " @entity76			1
" and many of this nation 's leaders have joined in the growing chorus of conscientious objectors who see @entity18 mascots for what they are : racist			1
senate majority leader @entity84 , sen. @entity85 , and @entity86 , councilman @entity87 have each been photographed holding signs that read " # @entity89 with # @entity90			0
" and , according to the folks at the @entity56 , more photos continue to stream in			0
@entity87 , who 's a @entity94 season ticket holder , recently told me he predicts the team name will , in fact , be abolished in the next five years			0
" ultimately we 're going to have to right this wrong , " he said			0
" the word ' redskins ' has never been used in a positive way			1
it 's been a racist and a derogatory term since forever			1
" sen. @entity84 told me : " the degrading team name inflicts pain on @entity41 populations			0
the name is going to change ; it 's only a question of when			0
the @entity109 and @entity110 have to realize they are on the losing side of history			0
" opinion : @entity109 may throw flag on n - word , but what about the ' @entity117 ' ? several days ago , i was asked : " why are you picking on the @entity94 ? what about the @entity23 or the @entity120 ? " first , the term " redskins " is a pejorative , a racial slur			1
we are told by our elders that the eastern @entity127 word for woman is shunksqaw , and that " squaw " in the @entity135 usage came to signify that part of the woman the settlers wanted during negotiations			0
it always has been , just like the word " redskins			2
" the term " @entity18 " is n't a racial slur , even though it 's incorrect ; and neither are the terms " brave " or " warrior			1
" but that 's missing the point			0
when the status of a @entity41 is demoted to that of a caricature , we are objectified and diminished as a people			2
we become entertainment , not fellow citizens			0
how are you supposed to take me seriously if all you see is the stereotypical image of the @entity31 or sports mascot @entity18 ? courtesy of the @entity160 , we are no longer out of sight			1
we are no longer canceled out of the @entity7 conversation			0
also , more @entity18 live in urban settings than ever before			1
more than 70 % of us work , live and thrive in big cities			0
native americans on reservations have smartphones and laptops , so geographic isolation is slowly becoming a thing of the past as well			0
and we use these new technologies to speak out against the macro- and micro-aggressions directed at @entity18			1
today , we are lawyers , doctors , teachers , business owners , professional athletes , artists , and maybe your neighbor next door			0
we are proud to be @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , and many more			0
and so the momentum builds against the racism aimed at us , leaving the question : will you tell your children or grandchildren you are on the side of the @entity41 and allies who believe we deserve the same respect afforded to others ? or will you tell them we were just a group of politically correct @entity23 and @entity18 - lovers who were infringing on other people 's privilege ? right			1
the @entity94 fan , the @entity23 fan , the @entity120 fan -- they 're upset because they demand said privilege			0
we 're upset because we demand respect .			0

@entity210 : people recognize *prejudice* , but not against @entity18
@entity214 : @entity31 , @entity37 *inspire* " playing @entity18 " caricatures
he says " redskins " is a racist slur , " braves " and " warriors " are denigrating stereotypes
@entity214 : campaign is on to put real @entity18 in the public eye
