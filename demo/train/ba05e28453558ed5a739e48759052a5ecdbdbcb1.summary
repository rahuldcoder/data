to paraphrase the @entity2 " 30 for 30 " sports documentary opening : " what if i told you that a sport based on lying , cheating and rule bending worked perfectly fine as long as brown kids and fans paid the price ? " that title would never get past the editing room , and yet , stripping the @entity13 team of its @entity15 title for cheating ca n't be described any other way			1
the team 's loss of a championship and vacated wins is not only another horrible reminder of the racial politics of @entity25 sports but a blatantly obvious lesson to kids that cheating is ok as long as you have the right money and branding on your side			1
@entity33 , or the remaining part of @entity33 that still cares about baseball , fell in love with the @entity13 team last year when out of nowhere it won the @entity38 and gave @entity25 sports news two desperately needed narratives			1
first , that despite the gloom and doom and declining numbers , there was still a place for african - americans in baseball ; and second , that there was something going on with young black men out of @entity51 that did n't involve guns , death or crime			0
and that story continued , until this week			0
the @entity57 team , which @entity13 trounced 43 - 2 on its way to a @entity33 championship , made a couple of calls to @entity62 accusing the @entity63 of violating residency boundaries for players			1
in other words , the @entity13 players were a " superteam , " which had an unfair advantage			1
@entity62 , acting with a swiftness and severity that should embarrass the @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 managed to conduct an investigation , determine who was at fault and strip a bunch of kids of their championship because grown - ups cheated			0
this never should have happened			0
minor children should not have to suffer a crushing loss of their title because grown - ups cheated , and there are other ways the cheating parents and coaches could be punished without causing the kids to suffer			1
the sports myth in @entity33 is that whether you 're @entity95 , @entity96 or even the @entity97 , whatever your social class , race or background , when you get onto that field or court or arena it 's a meritocracy			2
the cream will rise to the top , the best players succeed and cheaters get weeded out before the clock hits double zero			0
has this ever been totally true in @entity25 sports ? no. but if the @entity51 team 's namesake proved anything 50 years ago it 's that no matter what shenanigans are pulled in the game , the good guys should win out			2
the racial context of this punishment is jarring enough			0
the @entity13 team is the first all @entity25 team to win the @entity33 championship and suddenly the league decides to flip through the rulebooks ? unfortunately , increased scrutiny on all - black teams seems to be the norm for @entity62			1
just ask the @entity129 @entity128 that has been blocked from competing in the @entity33 and @entity130 twice in the last few years on technicalities that other teams have openly flouted for years			0
when the @entity13 players look back on this debacle , all they 'll have learned is that cheating is fine as long as there 's money to be made , you do n't get caught , and if you do , the least powerful people end up suffering for it			1
is @entity142 going to investigate every team that played in this year 's tournament ? is it going to vacate wins from the " whistleblowing " @entity57 that may have broken the same boundary rules three years ago ? better yet , will it return sponsorships , money and ticket sales to fans who attended these games with a " cheating " team they failed to identify ? of course they wo n't , just like cheaters in in big money high - school , college and professional sports seldom get their comeuppance			1
did n't we just watch two weeks of " @entity164 " coverage where the @entity162 were accused of breaking the rules again ? but @entity165 is the golden boy of a multi-billion dollar league , so even if @entity71 commissioner @entity167 found a box of pressure gauges , a can of stick - um and a receipt for 30 @entity173 from @entity174 in @entity165 's locker he would n't dare take back that @entity176			2
you never want to give kids the impression that cheating is ok			2
but you know what 's worse than kids thinking cheating is ok ? when they learn that only certain cheaters get in trouble , but if you have the right money or fame or skin color you get a free pass			0
if @entity33 really cared about cheating and keeping sports as a real example to kids of hard work paying off , the solution is right in front of us			2
everyone from the @entity202 to the @entity71 to the @entity72 would crack down on all cheating equally , no matter the color , the money involved or the prestige gained			0
and punishments would be levied against those responsible , instead of just those who are the most visible and vulnerable .			0

@entity13 team is stripped of its title for violating residency rules
@entity212 : why punish team that severely when sports cheating is *rampant* ?
