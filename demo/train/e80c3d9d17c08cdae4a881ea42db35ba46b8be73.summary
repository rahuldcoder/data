-- there are not many @entity3 villains who survive to tell the tale of their encounter with 007			1
@entity6 is neither shaken nor stirred , although that 's more than can be said for his character " @entity8 " -- who was blown to smithereens by @entity11 in the 2006 epic " @entity13			1
" @entity6 has proved even more elusive than the acrobatic bomb - maker he portrayed in the villages of @entity16 , where he vaulted through jungle and a construction site , leaping perilously off buildings and cranes			1
rather than " @entity29 , " the career of @entity6 -- known as the founder of free running and a developer of its close relative @entity26 -- has taken off in a way he never dreamed of			1
" being in the @entity3 movie was just amazing , " the @entity30 tells @entity0 's human to @entity32			1
" it was fantastic working on a big stage , fighting @entity3 and having the helicopter shoot everything			1
" knowing that i 've never done any acting , i did n't plan to be in a movie like this			2
" for the discipline , i think it was a big platform and i think it just made free running bigger and bigger			1
i worked with @entity47 on her @entity48 and my life changed at this point because i went from being a free runner , an ambassador , to something even bigger			1
" @entity6 has come a long way since running around @entity55 as a teenager with the likes of @entity26 founder @entity58			1
@entity26 -- which is taken from the @entity61 word " parcours " meaning " route " or " course " -- consists of being able to " move freely over and through any terrain using only the abilities of the body , principally through running , jumping , climbing and quadrupedal movement			1
" @entity6 , while a keen student of @entity26 in his teens , believed that the discipline was far too narrow and lacked a spiritual aspect			1
instead , he created a fusion of the art -- taking @entity26 and a new philosophical approach to bring about free running			1
" it 's a lifestyle , " he says			2
" there is no beginning , no middle and no end			2
it is part of my life			2
" it 's like a bird			2
when a bird wakes up , it 's a bird , it 's flying , and for me it 's exactly the same thing			2
" it 's when i wake up , i am free running ; when i 'm sitting , i 'm still free running			1
when i talk to you , i 'm thinking about free running			1
it 's part of me now , it 's like walking			2
" in 2003 , @entity6 finally decided to break away from @entity26 after performing in @entity95 , where he now resides			1
his belief that " all the world is a playground " gives him a feeling of freedom which he treasures			2
" @entity26 at the beginning was very one - dimensional , " he says			1
" it was very a to @entity104 , ' we should n't do this , we should n't do that , ' which does n't work for me as an artist			2
" i really feel like i want to express myself			2
i do n't want to have any limitations			0
" free running is known as using the environment and expressing yourself -- which means you can do anything you feel			1
it 's part of you			0
" you can do flips , tricks , swing , anything which is creative and feels beautiful -- it 's more my way			0
it 's freedom of expression for me			0
" while most of us would simply walk around our city or neighborhood by using the sidewalk , such an idea is almost alien to @entity6			1
if there is a slope to slide down or a wall to run up , then he needs no invitation to perform some of the moves witnessed in that breathless sequence where he runs from @entity3			1
" as soon as i get outside , my mindset turns to free running , " he explains			1
" i use the whole environment and instead of just following a straight path , i do my own way of going outside			0
" if it 's just to jump , to perform , you have to be really focused on what you 're going to do , where you 're going to put your step , on your technique also because the surface is completely different			0
" it can be metal , it can be concrete and there are so many elements -- sometimes you can have also people coming and walking past			0
" you need to pay attention and that 's what you 're thinking about before you do a single move			0
" the expertise to be able to pull off the stunts which @entity6 does comes after 20 years of training -- five to seven hours a day			1
those who want to apply need only a high level of flexibility , excellent spacial awareness , unparalleled sense of balance and the ability of @entity169 when it comes to jumping and climbing			0
yes , even those who suffer from acrophobia -- a fear of heights -- can have a go , says @entity6 , who has coped with the problem since his childhood			1
while his background is in track and field , @entity6 is a keen rock climber , plays football and ice skates -- even appearing in a @entity186 tv show , " @entity187			2
" all these skills garnered from different sports help to provide new inspiration and ideas for his free running			1
" each time i look at the city , i start to see how functional it can be , " he said			0
" it 's normal to walk down the stairs , to go to a different place , but for a practitioner from @entity26 to free running , it is important for us to see how functional the environment is " for example , a slope can be something you can slide down and feel your balance			1
@entity209 -- you can see how many times you can bounce down them			0
" we have also got a technique that we call ' tick tack ' where you use the wall to the side			0
" the environment is like a computer game where you see a ghost of yourself			0
you picture a line or a route and you think to yourself , ' can i do this path ? ' that is how i see the environment			0
" free running has become more and more popular in recent years , with @entity226 setting up his own academy			1
his expertise and advice is invaluable to those fellow thrillseekers who fuel their escapism through adrenaline			2
but as @entity226 confirms , free running does come with a health warning			1
" it is a very risky discipline , " he says			0
" if you do n't know what you are doing then you can hurt yourself and even die			0
" @entity237 and risk is a perception and if you do something without knowing what you 're doing , you 're going to be in trouble , you 're going to hurt yourself			0
" there is danger everywhere			0
whether you 're taking the car , the plane , whether you are @entity246 athlete , there is risk and you can hurt yourself			0
" people need to know everything required -- dedication and a lot of practice			0
" now 39 , you might expect @entity6 to be contemplating retirement from such an extreme sport			2
that option is not even a consideration at this moment in time -- if ever			0
" i see myself even more than an athlete , " he says			0
" i would see myself as an ultimate athlete			0
" in a sense , i 'm closer to an animal , to my inner nature			0
there is no end of my career ; you do n't have a point where you go , ' oh , now you 're 29 or 30 years old and now you 're finished			0
' " it does n't work like this for me			0
it will be forever , i will practice this forever until i die			0
