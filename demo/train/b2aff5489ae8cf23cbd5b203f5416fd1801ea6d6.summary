when she was an undergraduate at @entity5 , books like " @entity1 " and " @entity2 " captivated @entity6 , inspiring her to become a disease detective			1
fifteen years later , lt. @entity6 , a newly minted officer with the @entity8 , stepped off a plane in @entity10 to fight @entity11 , ready to implement the key strategy she 'd been taught : contact tracing			1
the process that 's helped stop diseases like @entity16 and smallpox seems simple : find everyone who had close contact with infected individuals and track them for 21 days			2
if any of these contacts comes down with the disease , isolate them from the community and repeat the process by tracking the contacts ' contacts			1
but tracing works only if you have a list of the contacts and their addresses			1
when @entity35 arrived at a @entity37 office in @entity38 , she found that the database she needed was " pretty much in shambles			1
" many contacts ' addresses were missing or were vague like " down by the farm road			1
" in all , only 20 % to 30 % of the contacts in the database had a usable address			1
that meant the local contact tracers were n't able to do their jobs properly			1
" they were really unfamiliar with what contact tracing was , " she said			1
" and they did n't have the resources they needed			2
" according to the @entity58 , only 16 of 44 zones in @entity10 have sufficient contact tracing			1
this inability to do complete contact tracing is a major reason -- perhaps the major reason -- that the @entity11 outbreak continues to spiral out of control , according to public health officials and experts			1
" there 's a lot of infection out there			0
then you have a real problem			0
" dr. @entity74 , assistant director - general of the @entity75 , said august 28			0
@entity77 officials have said there are n't enough contact tracers to get the job done , and the organization forecasts an " exponential increase " in the number of @entity11 cases in the coming weeks			1
@entity85 is n't surprised that the system is breaking down in many areas			2
an infectious disease epidemiologist at the @entity89 , he 's worked in @entity10 for more than 25 years			2
like @entity35 , he often found that people had no address -- or had one that even locals could n't decipher			0
residents moved a lot , and when they did , many times they took their doors and locks with them to save money			0
they would n't change the number on the door , so the streets ended up with a mishmash of addresses			2
add that to the fact that people are often uncooperative with the tracers , sometimes even throwing stones at health care workers			0
they fear that they or their loved ones will be put in the hospital ; they 've seen firsthand that people who go there often do n't return			0
" the community perceives this as a death sentence , " he said			0
" relinquishing your loved one is tantamount to death			0
" and health care workers have very little to offer people as an incentive to cooperate			0
" with smallpox , we could offer people a vaccine , a carrot in essence to induce them to be cooperative			0
with @entity11 , we have nothing , " @entity133 said			1
in @entity38 , @entity35 , an officer with the @entity135 at the @entity136 , remembers the words of her agency 's director , dr. @entity140			0
battling @entity11 is like fighting a forest fire : @entity143 even just one contact , and you could be leaving behind a burning ember that will reignite the outbreak			1
when @entity35 arrived in @entity38 on august 17 , she brought software on a thumb drive to manage cases and contacts			2
the software was designed by the @entity136 and was far more effective at organizing thousands of names than the unwieldy @entity154 spreadsheet that the local health care workers had been using			0
with the help of other organizations , she also got the workers more computers and training in how to do contact tracing			1
now , hundreds of contact tracers are assigned to go out into the neighborhoods in her district every day			2
she says the death and illness all around her spur her on			0
" each one of these heartbreaking stories just makes me want to cry , " she said			0
" it 's more reason to try harder and think of more creative solutions			0

disease detective finds contact tracing system for @entity11 outbreak " in shambles "
many contacts ' addresses were missing or vague
only 20 % to 30 % of contacts in database were being properly followed
