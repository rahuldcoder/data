-- could reliability be an achilles heel for @entity4 world champions @entity3 this season ? if the first two days of winter testing are anything to go by the answer could be yes			1
four - time world champion @entity9 was stopped in his tracks by an engine failure after completing just eight laps in the new @entity3 racer wednesday			1
" we 've not had a lot of running and have a few problems to sort out , " @entity9 told reporters at the @entity16 circuit in @entity17			1
" but with such big rule changes it is usual to have some teething problems			2
" that 's what tests are for , to sort those issues out			0
the next two days will be important to get some track time to prepare for the tests in @entity31			0
" @entity9 , who only managed three laps in the box fresh car on tuesday , has now returned home to @entity36 and handed the keys of the 2014 @entity3 over to his new teammate @entity38 for the remainder of the @entity16 test			1
preseason testing is always a tense time but a major rule change has heaped extra pressure on the teams hoping to get their cars race ready for the opening @entity49 @entity4 on march 16			2
the cars are now powered by 1.6 - liter @entity52 turbo engines which also rely on a greater use of hybrid energy -- recovered through braking and from the car 's exhaust gases			0
although engine suppliers @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 put their engines through their paces on dynamometers at their headquarters , they are running them on the cars for the first time this week			0
@entity3 , who along with the @entity69 and @entity70 teams use @entity59 engines , had to cut short @entity9 's track time because of problem with the energy recovery system on his car			1
engine gremlins also affected @entity77 , @entity3 's sister team , and driver @entity78 was not able to take his car out on track because of an electrical problem			2
@entity81 recovered from the technical issues that had kept its car in the garage tuesday to see @entity85 set the leading time in its 2014 racer with a best lap of one minute 24.165 seconds among 44 laps overall			1
" for our first day of actual running , we were able to get a good understanding of the car , and the way the engine and turbo behaves , " @entity85 told reporters			0
" it 's tricky , and very different to what we 're used to , but i feel that these cars will be enjoyable to drive			0
" on wednesday , @entity81 also announced former @entity69 team principal @entity101 as its new racing director as a restructure of the team continues			0
it was another solid day from @entity60 's @entity104 , who set the second fastest time ahead of @entity105 in the @entity106 and @entity107 's @entity61			1
@entity107 underlined @entity61 ' reliability by ticking off 96 laps , all the more impressive as the car had to rebuilt over night following @entity112 's crash on the opening day of the test .			0
