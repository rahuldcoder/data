@entity0 -- for four decades , @entity0 's underground transport network has been @entity4 's photographic playground			1
he has collected surprisingly intimate shots in what , for many , is a most impersonal environment			0
at times @entity4 's subjects stare straight down the camera ; others are unaware of their role as protagonist in a decades - long story of the city			1
@entity4 , 65 , was born in @entity0 to a @entity16 couple			1
his dad , @entity17 , was a cabbie and his mother , @entity18 , a cultured woman who encouraged her son into the arts			0
@entity4 was given his first camera , an @entity22 , for his @entity23 aged 13			1
he recalls taking his first picture , of the @entity25 , before being encouraged by an arts teacher who showed the budding photographer images by @entity28 and @entity29			2
@entity4 began taking photographs on the @entity31 as he commuted to and from his work as a cinema projectionist			1
" it felt like a party that i was the official photographer of , " he says			0
eventually , " i 'd been doing it so long that it was my job			0
" no one ever protested , or ever complained , or ever tried to stop me			0
so i kind of felt by accident that everyone thought it was cool			0
" what he 's captured is an unexpectedly personal flip - book of @entity0 since the 1970s : the fashion , the buskers , drunks , runaways and love stories			1
@entity4 describes himself as a " nosy - parker " and " social butterfly , " who says he has " always seen beautiful things			1
" his images capture " shape , and form , and i love the textures , and i love the lighting and i like the poses			2
i like seeing what comes off people when i point the camera at them			0
" @entity4 says they merge into " this kind of mish - mash of colours and texture and atmosphere and smiles and scowls			2
when it works it 's really great			0
i look at some of these myself and think , ' how did i do that ? ' " the insides of the carriages also reveal @entity0 's changing times , as the newspapers and cigarettes which once littered the floors made way for bright lights and @entity80			1
when he first started , the @entity81 " did look pretty grotty , " @entity4 says			2
" the stations were rough and that has a character which comes over in the pictures			0
i think people identify with that and it gives it this historical edge			0
" now , @entity4 adds , the lights are " neon and there 's no atmosphere			1
" @entity0 blog @entity95 first championed the then little - known @entity4 's work in 2013 , and was bombarded with responses			1
@entity99 has now released the images in hardback , titled @entity81 , with a debut exhibition held in @entity104 's @entity103			1
many of the subjects , @entity4 says , may be unaware they will feature			2
" i did photograph a lot of people on the @entity109 , hundreds and hundreds			0
there are a lot of people out there who i 'd like to think [ might say ] ' dammit , i wish i was n't in this book			0
' " his favorites include the theatrical peroxide blonde in the midst of a dramatic public phone call , the inter-racial couple in red and blue colors , which " was like @entity121 and good vibes and equality , " and the so - called " @entity127 " man whose perfectly upright body is topped by @entity109 's clock			0
and , even as he instinctively snapped scenes that caught his eye , @entity4 knew the project had gravitas			2
" when you shoot something for 30 to 40 years , even though i did n't consciously have a plan , i felt there was something even i did n't know about yet			1
and you suddenly become aware that you are documenting something that is going to have a historical bent to it			0
" after he has finished the interview , @entity4 is driven off , past @entity143 's famous 24 - hour bagel bakery			1
the doors frame a sweet scene of a woman with her little girl , wheeling a plastic scooter			0
@entity4 , his camera sticking out the window , captures the moment			2
