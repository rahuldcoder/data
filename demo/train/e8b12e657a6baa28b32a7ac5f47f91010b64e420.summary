at the former concentration camp @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 has been to @entity0 three times : first as a child prisoner of just 4 years old			1
he has only fragments of memories from his time here : staring out at barbed wire , running down concrete stairs , hiding in a corner			2
and one especially vivid memory that still haunts his dreams , the bloodied face of an elderly man			2
last year , he visited the @entity23 @entity22 - run concentration camp as a survivor			2
he came for closure and says he felt an overwhelming sense of relief			2
during the 70 - year memorial for the liberation of @entity0 on tuesday , he visited the camp in search for his identical twin brother , separated shortly after liberation			1
" sometimes i stare at people in the street , and i look for someone who looks like me , " he said			1
" my biggest hope is my brother will be here			2
or maybe another survivor can tell me something , recognize me or remember us both			2
" but as he stands in the snow , next to the barbed wire and the brick buildings , his heart pounds			2
he turns away to hide his tears			2
seventy years ago , @entity3 was known as @entity50 , @entity51 7733			1
@entity0 records show he had a twin , @entity53 7734			1
both were subjected to the medical experiments of @entity22 doctor @entity56			2
and both survived @entity0 to be taken into a care home for children after liberation			1
but @entity50 was adopted by a man searching for his own wife and children in the chaos and eventually taken to @entity64			1
he was given the new name of @entity3			1
what happened to @entity53 is unknown			1
for decades , @entity3 did n't even know he had a twin			1
his only memory came to him in the form of dreams of another boy , blond like him , sleeping in bed beside him			0
it took nearly 70 years and the help of his genealogist , @entity75 , poring over documents for him to prove his instinct was real			0
in one sense , she says , his lack of memory is a blessing : " i 'm really happy for him that he lost his memory			0
" she told @entity2 , " it 's so much easier to establish a normal life			1
but even then , he had nightmares			0
just imagine if he remembered			0
" but it means she must rely on the memories of other survivors to try and track down his twin			1
" it 's all about the awareness of friends and neighbors			0
if he 's there and he knows about the search , he 'll need some courage to come forward , and then he 'll find he has a wonderful family			0
" @entity103 has launched a @entity104 titled a- 7734 in the hope that social media will spread word of his search			0
there has been progress : a dna match found @entity3 's first cousins in the @entity115 -- the only relatives from his birth family			1
they had no idea that @entity3 was alive and had assumed that he and his entirely family had perished in @entity0			1
it was an emotional reunion , and his cousins gave him a gift : the only photo of his birth parents			0
" they told me so much about my mother , " he says , smiling			0
" the most important thing : now i know my mother 's face			0
before i had remembered only her blond hair			0
now i can see her			0
" but he still searches for @entity53			1
and he comes to @entity0 in the hope he will remember some clue , another survivor will recognize him			1
maybe even his own brother			0
he says he has new dream now : he sees himself walking in a forest with his brother , wearing identical clothes -- black trousers -- and a short sleeve blue shirt			0
is it a dream or does he believe it will become a reality ? " maybe , i do n't know			0
but standing in the snow , outside the very building he was held as a prisoner as a young boy , @entity3 insists he has not given up			1
" no , not at all			0
" he says , " it only makes me want to search for him even more			0
" in @entity0 , the place of his nightmares , @entity3 still finds hope to dream .			1

@entity3 , then called @entity50 , was separated from his twin , @entity53 , after liberation
" sometimes i stare at people in the street , and i look for someone who looks like me , " he says
@entity2 goes with him to @entity0 , where he hopes memories might be *triggered*
