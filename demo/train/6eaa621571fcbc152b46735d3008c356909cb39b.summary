at the edge of the heliosphere , you would n't know by looking whether you left the cradle of humanity behind and floated out into interstellar space			1
you would just see unfathomably empty space , no matter which side of the invisible line you were on			2
but scientists now have strong evidence that @entity13 's @entity12 probe has crossed this important border , making history as the first human - made object to leave the heliosphere , the magnetic boundary separating the solar system 's sun , planets and solar wind from the rest of the galaxy			1
" in leaving the heliosphere and setting sail on the cosmic seas between the stars , @entity12 has joined other historic journeys of exploration : the first circumnavigation of the @entity34 , the first steps on the @entity36 , " said @entity31 , chief scientist on the @entity12 mission			1
" that 's the kind of event this is , as we leave behind our solar bubble			0
" a new study in the journal @entity44 suggests that the probe entered the interstellar medium around august 25 , 2012			1
you may have heard other reports that @entity12 has made the historic crossing before , but thursday was the first time @entity13 announced it			1
the twin spacecraft @entity12 and 2 were launched in 1977 , 16 days apart			1
as of thursday , according to @entity13 's real - time odometer , @entity12 is 18.8 billion kilometers ( 11.7 billion miles ) from @entity34			1
its sibling , @entity54 , is 15.3 billion ( 9.5 billion ) kilometers from our planet			0
voyager 1 is being hailed as the first probe to leave the solar system			1
but under a stricter definition of " solar system , " which includes the distant comets that orbit the sun , we 'd have to wait another 30,000 years for it to get that far , @entity31 said			0
another milestone for long after we 're gone : the probe will fly near a star in about 40,000 years , @entity31 said			0
how do we know ? @entity12 , currently traveling at more than 38,000 miles per hour , never sent a postcard saying " @entity70 from interstellar space ! " so whether it has made the historic crossing or not is a matter of controversy			1
" the spacecraft itself really does n't know , " @entity31 said			0
" it 's only instruments that can tell us whether we 're inside or outside			0
" further complicating matters , the device aboard @entity12 that measures plasma -- a state of matter with charged particles -- broke in 1980			1
to get around that , scientists detected waves in the plasma around the spacecraft and used that information to calculate density			0
vibrations in the plasma came from a large coronal mass ejection from the sun in 2012 , resulting in what @entity31 called a " solar wind tsunami			2
" these vibrations reached the area around @entity12 this spring			1
measurements taken between april 9 and may 22 of this year show that @entity12 was , at that time , located in an area with an electron density of about 0.08 per cubic centimeter			1
in the interstellar medium , the density of electrons is thought to be between 0.05 and 0.22 per cubic centimeter			2
the particles of interstellar plasma were created by the explosions of giant stars , and carry the magnetic field of the galaxy , scientists said			2
last year , between october 23 and november 27 , researchers calculate that @entity12 was in an area with an electron density of 0.06 per cubic centimeter			1
that 's still within the interstellar space range , and it means that over time the spacecraft passed through plasma with increasing electron density			1
the study , led by @entity126 physicist @entity125 , suggests that the plasma density is about 30 times higher in the interstellar medium than in the heliosphere , which is close to what scientists thought based on other kinds of measurements			1
the boundary is called the heliopause			0
@entity12 mission timeline : when did it happen ? scientists have been using several kinds of measurements to figure out if and when @entity12 had reached the interstellar medium			1
evidence from particle data had already pointed toward the conclusion that the probe succeeded			0
in late july and early august of 2012 , scientists saw dips in the concentration of particles made in the solar system , and peaks in particles made outside			1
" if you just looked at that data , you 'd think it 's pretty clear that we 've actually crossed a boundary			0
we 're no longer in the place where the solar system particles are being made , and we 're actually out in the interstellar medium , " said @entity157 , associate research scientist in the @entity158 in @entity159 and @entity160 at the @entity161			2
@entity157 was not involved in the new study , but has worked with @entity12 data			1
magnetic field measurements suggested otherwise			0
researchers had expected to see stark changes in magnetic field direction when the probe crossed out of the heliosphere , but that was n't supported by measurements from the probe			2
@entity157 and colleagues published a modeling study suggesting that the particle data is more relevant , and that the magnetic field might not change as much as people thought			2
they proposed a crossing - over date of july 27 -- about a month sooner than the new study			2
the specific date will likely be debated for some time , @entity157 said			0
one possible explanation is that if the heliosphere is analogous to an air - conditioned room , @entity185 stepped through the doorway into a hot room on july 27			2
for a month it was in a metaphorical room with a mixture of hot and cold air , and finally entered the truly hot part on august 25			1
puzzles still surround the magnetic field at the edge of the heliosphere , @entity31 said , and " we 're going to be prepared to have more surprises			2
" @entity13 sends unmanned rocket to the moon what else is out there ? @entity12 has only 68 @entity203 of memory on board -- far less than a smartphone , said @entity207 , voyager project manager			1
scientists communicate with the spacecraft every day			0
" it 's the little spacecraft that could , " she said in a @entity13 press conference			0
the probe now has a totally new mission , @entity31 said			2
" we 're now on the first mission to explore interstellar space , " he said			1
" we will now look and learn in detail how the wind which is outside , that came from these other stars , is deflected around the heliosphere			0
" wind -- made of particles -- from these other stars has to go around the heliosphere the way a water in a stream flows around a rock , @entity31 said			0
scientists are interested in learning more about the interaction between our solar wind and wind from other stars			0
natural radioactive decay provides heat that generates enough electricity to help @entity12 communicate with @entity34			1
the first science instrument will be turned off in 2020 , and the last one will be shut down in 2025 , @entity31 said			0
both @entity12 probes carry time capsules known as " the golden record , " a 12 - inch , gold - plated copper disc with images and sounds so that extraterrestrials could learn about us			1
let 's hope they can build appropriate record players			0
@entity54 will likely leave the heliosphere in about three to four years , @entity31 said			0
its plasma instrument is still working , @entity31 said , so scientists can directly measure the stellar wind 's density , speed and temperature			0
that also means that when it crosses out of the heliosphere , @entity54 will send a clearer signal			0
at that time , it will join its twin in the vast nothingness between stars that used to be beyond our reach			0
