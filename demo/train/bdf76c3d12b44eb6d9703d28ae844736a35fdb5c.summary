@entity1 also made no public mention of the controversial @entity6 air defense space declaration , instead focusing on the possibilities of good relations between the two nations			1
he cited discussions between @entity7 and president @entity60 this summer seeking a " new model " in relations between the countries as @entity6 seeks to expand its influence worldwide and as the @entity2 pivots its attention from the @entity65 to @entity66			2
" as we 've discussed in the past , this new model of major - country cooperation ultimately has to be based on trust , and a positive notion about the motive of one another , " @entity1 said			0

the dispute over the islands has led to tense situations between ships and planes from the two countries over the past year , raising concerns that an incident in @entity6 's newly declared defense zone could spiral out of control			1
it has also fueled concern among @entity2 officials about how far @entity6 is willing to go to pursue its interests in the @entity131 and push back against @entity2 influence			0
@entity6 is asking aircraft entering its air defense zone to identify themselves and submit flight plans			1
it says the zone is similar to others maintained by nations around the world , saying that it is not asserting territorial control over the airspace and that legitimate commercial traffic will continue to move through the region unhindered			0
@entity6 's declaration prompted pushback from the @entity2 and other nations in the region , which rejected the zone and continued to route military flights through the area			1
@entity20 has told its commercial airlines not to comply with the new @entity6 demands , but the @entity2 government has urged @entity2 carriers to follow @entity9 's instructions			2

the @entity6 action , @entity1 said , raises the possibility of " accidents and miscalculation			0
" in a statement tuesday , a spokesman for @entity6 's @entity180 said the zone is one of " safety , not risks , a zone of cooperation , not competition			0
" without naming the @entity2 , spokesman @entity188 , warned countries about becoming involved in @entity6 's dispute with @entity20			1
" other parties concerned should also mind their words and actions , and should not do things to undermine regional stability and bilateral relations , " he said			0
" other parties should not be incited , or send wrong signals to make a very few countries go further on the wrong track , which will follow the same old disastrous road and undermine regional and world peace			0
