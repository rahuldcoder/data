@entity0 , @entity1 -- when baseball slugger @entity4 admitted he had used steroids in his record - breaking 1998 season , he recalled refusing to talk about the subject in his 2005 testimony to @entity9			1
" after all this time , i want to come clean , " @entity4 announced			1
" i was not in a position to do that five years ago in my congressional testimony , but now i feel an obligation to discuss this and to answer questions about it			1
i 'll do that , and then i just want to help my team			2
" @entity4 's admission come as the @entity19 has been investigating the problem of brain injuries to football players , following heated discussions october 28 , when the committee aggressively questioned @entity26 officials to figure out why the league had done so little to curb this well - known problem			1
any government inquiry of this kind draws the familiar charge that politicians should stay out of the business of sports -- even though the @entity26 and @entity35 have in fact responded to congressional pressure by instituting rules to protect players from brain damage			1
still , @entity44 rep. @entity43 said , we " should also avoid the temptation to legislate in this area			2
football -- like soccer , rugby and even basketball and baseball -- involves contact that can produce injuries			1
we can not legislate the elimination of injuries from the games without eliminating the games themselves			2
" this is a familiar refrain			2
back in 2005 , when several committees investigated the use of steroids in baseball , numerous sports officials warned this was not an issue with which @entity9 should concern itself			1
yet insisting on a firewall between sports and politics ignores the long - standing relationship between these two parts of @entity72 society			1
at the state and local level , sports teams depend on government assistance			1
there have been a large number of public subsidies , ranging from appropriations for stadium construction to the placement of public transportation near stadiums to tax breaks which the sports industry has depended on for growth			1
at the federal level , sports owners have also benefited from government			1
in 1922 , the @entity91 exempted baseball from the antitrust laws			2
as a result of this , baseball owners were allowed to maintain their monopoly , stifling efforts to launch other leagues and using the exemption to collude on limiting the salaries of players			2
some legislators introduced bills trying to overturn the decision , but @entity9 never passed them			2
when the @entity110 held hearings about the exemption in 1958 , a number of famous players , including @entity108 and @entity109 , showed up to speak about how the " reserve clause " undermined the rights of players			0
@entity9 refused to take any action			0
free agency did not start until the 1980s			0
it was only in 1998 that @entity9 finally passed legislation declaring that some rules , such as restrictions on the movement of players from one team to another , were subject to antitrust laws			1
@entity127 has a political history of its own			0
according to the sports historian @entity130 , the @entity26 started a team in @entity132 in 1966 , right after rep. @entity133 and sen. @entity134 of @entity135 helped push through legislation that exempted the @entity26 from antitrust laws so that there could be a merger with the successful @entity140			1
when @entity142 rep. @entity141 insisted on long hearings to decide whether this was permissible , sen. long , desperate for a team , short - circuited the legislative process by having the @entity110 pass a bill by acclamation and attaching it to important anti-inflation tax legislation			0
the @entity19 , under pressure , agreed to the bill at the last minute			0
" we could n't have merged if @entity9 had n't passed the law , " said @entity26 commissioner @entity153			0
" and without a merger , we could n't have had a @entity157			0
if we 'd tried to do it on our own , the antitrust people would have challenged us sooner than later			0
" there is also a long history of congressional investigations into sports			1
in 1960 , the @entity110 conducted hearings about the influence of organized crime in professional boxing			0
@entity72 were shocked when former middleweight champion @entity168 admitted that he had thrown a fight against @entity170 in november 1947			0
members of the mafia threatened to kill @entity168 , but he testified anyway			0
during similar hearings in 1961 , the boxer @entity173 told legislators that " it seems absolutely essential that a federal czar be named to head the professional sport of boxing			1
" many years later , in 2007 , @entity9 looked into the pension and disability plans of the @entity26 after complaints by injured players that they were being denied coverage			0
@entity9 has been willing to legislate			0
on october 9 , 1996 , president @entity185 signed the @entity186 into law , which defined minimum health and safety standards for the sport			0
the legislation aimed to strengthen the patchwork regulations used by states to monitor the sport			0
but investigations usually do n't produce legislation			0
in 2005 , @entity9 failed to pass the @entity196 or the @entity197 in response to revelations of drug use			0
even so , investigations do help raise public awareness about problems and create public pressure on the industry to reform			0
" when there is not any regulation , " said former heavyweight champion @entity206 , " it can cause someone to lose their dream , their hopes ...			0
" while some issues , such as the recent investigation into the college bowl system , are easy fodder for ridicule , others , such as brain damage to @entity26 players , show where the government has a legitimate role			1
after all , sports is big business , and the playing field is a workplace where regulations are needed			1
unfortunately , the sports leagues themselves have not taken an aggressive approach to dealing with this problem			2
in the same way that baseball owners understood that steroids produced more crowd - pleasing home runs , football owners know that the kind of hard - hitting football that creates injuries often brings crowds to their feet			1
the government must help guide the industry toward better practices			2
there is a precedent for investigation			2
and sports has depended too much on government to now claim to be a free agent			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity255 .			1

@entity255 : @entity4 steroids case *reminds* why congressional inquiry can be useful
he says sports officials balk at *oversight* yet take government assistance
@entity255 : football head injury issue is a worthy subject for government investigation
