-- last week , @entity2 @entity1 voted to delay the implementation of the individual mandate of the @entity5 , trying to take advantage of president @entity8 's announcement that the employer mandate will be delayed for a year			1
the vote is purely symbolic as there is no chance that the @entity13 will pass the bill			0
striking a populist tone , republicans argued that individuals should be afforded the same rights as big businesses			0
the response of the @entity1 is predictable , as @entity2 @entity1 have been steadfast in their efforts to block the administration from making progress on any new bills and to cause problems for those that are already on the books			1
the hope of conservatives like @entity30 is that this is just the first step			0
@entity32 's crossroads also released a video called " @entity34 , " playing on the television movie phenomenon " @entity36 , " with the announcer warning that " nobody is safe from its wrath			0
" the video throws in a healthy dose of @entity43 images , just in case anyone thought that scandal would be soon laid to rest			0
and on yesterday 's " @entity48 " , speaker @entity49 called @entity8 's health care law " not ready for prime time " and promised further action to seek to block it , saying , " we 're going to stay at it			1
" but if @entity2 @entity1 keep pushing too hard against the @entity5 , they could easily open up more internal fissures , creating a party that is even more fraught with tensions as the presidential election of 2016 comes closer			1
the strategy of congressional @entity1 toward the health care program has evolved			1
at first , @entity1 were relatively unified in their opposition , both during the debate over the passage of the legislation in 2009 and 2010 and in the two years that followed with the early stages of implementation			2
during that time , almost every @entity1 consistently challenged the argument that the legislation would improve the overall quality of the nation 's health care system and make it more equitable			1
republicans also challenged its constitutional legitimacy			0
but those arguments started to fade away among @entity1 , first when the @entity76 ruled that the law was constitutional in june 2012 and then when president @entity8 was re-elected			1
the internal tensions among @entity1 became worse over the past few months as the states needed to make decisions about whether to take an infusion of federal @entity83 funding that was part of the legislation , a key component that would help insure more of the poor			2
not only did many red - state republicans believe this funding would help constituents , but they also heard from doctors and hospitals that depend on @entity83 to survive			0
when @entity93 originally passed the bill , most @entity1 governors had steadfastly insisted that they would not accept the funds			1
but those objections started to fade away for many in the @entity1 when the money was actually before them			2
many stalwart conservative governors , like @entity100 in @entity101 , @entity102 in @entity103 , and @entity104 in @entity105 said they would take the funds despite previous statements			0
they found themselves in open conflict with their own @entity1 legislatures over the issue			2
those tensions have not all been resolved , but the support of @entity1 governors for the money changed the political dynamics quite significantly			1
now the challenges for the @entity118 who are still opposing the bill are becoming even more difficult -- despite all the press about how the delay in the employer mandate signals huge challenges -- as concrete benefits start to roll out			2
this was already clear when younger @entity127 under 26 started to enjoy continued coverage under their parents ' plans , a fact not forgotten in the election when the youth vote swung to @entity8 once again			2
now the challenges are intensifying			0
the same week that there was all the discussion about the delay of the mandate , and as @entity1 were trying to seize advantage from the delay , the @entity135 reported more visible signs of what the program may bring			1
for those who do n't receive benefits through their employers and will purchase benefits through health care exchanges , the cost of insurance will fall by 50 % or more			1
in @entity153 an individual could see his or her bill drop from $ 1,000 a month to $ 308 a month			0
similar declines have been reported in @entity157 and @entity158			0
unless something goes terribly wrong for @entity5 , @entity118 might want to think twice about continuing with their attacks on this program			0
as @entity5 gets further away from the period when the program was most vulnerable , and as the administration is getting closer to the period when the benefits start rolling out , more constituents -- in red and blue states -- will cast a skeptical eye toward any legislator who tries to take away their benefits			2
speaker @entity49 , already struggling as @entity2 @entity1 make decisions on immigration that could have detrimental effects on the political standing of the party , might want to move on to different issues			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			0

@entity2 @entity1 voted to delay @entity5 's individual health care mandate
@entity182 : @entity1 risks fissures as @entity5 benefits become clear to @entity127
he says @entity1 governors are at odds with legislators over *aspects* of the law
@entity182 : *uncompromising* stance on health care is bad strategy for @entity1
