@entity0 -- @entity4 @entity3 leaders will unveil a 21 - page " @entity5 " on thursday that presents a " governing agenda " for what @entity3 would do if they win control of @entity9 in november			1
@entity1 obtained a copy of the document ( @entity12 ) wednesday			0
the plan focuses primarily on jobs and the economy , with a short reference in the " preamble " to the party 's position on social issues			0
according to the document , @entity4 @entity3 want to permanently extend all the tax cuts due to expire at the end of this year , give small businesses a tax deduction equal to 20 percent of their income and require @entity9 to review any new federal regulations that add to the deficit			1
the document lacks , however , a pledge against unrelated pet projects that members of @entity9 insert in spending bills to bring funding to their home districts -- known as earmarks			2
@entity39 earmarks is typically a staple of @entity3 policy			1
some provisions matched positions of the conservative @entity45 movement that has helped defeat mainstream @entity3 candidates in several primary elections this year			2
for example , the document calls for a federal hiring freeze on nonsecurity employees and requiring all legislation to include a clause showing that it is authorized under the @entity55			0
other items would cancel unspent funding authorized by the economic stimulus bill , roll back spending to levels before the stimulus bill and earlier federal bailout legislation and repeal the health care reform bill passed in march			2
the document also calls for permanently prohibiting taxpayer funding for abortion			0
several @entity3 sources said there was no intention to directly address social issues because the electorate is so heavily focused on jobs and spending			0
@entity3 leaders settled on a line that states : " we pledge to honor families , traditional marriage , life , and the private and faith - based organizations that form the core of our @entity83 values			1
" this language was a late addition , according to a @entity3 source , after conservative rep. @entity87 of @entity88 argued that social issues should be included in the document representing the agenda of @entity4 republicans			2
@entity4 @entity94 leaders said the document showed that @entity3 want to return to what they called failed policies of the past			1
a statement from @entity4 majority leader @entity101 's office mocked the @entity3 positions , saying they showed that @entity3 pledged allegiance to hedge fund managers on @entity106 , insurance companies , the " wealthiest of the wealthy , " oil companies and big corporations that outsource jobs , " with a recession and huge deficits for all			1
" the @entity3 document represents an updated version of the 1994 " @entity116			1
" that much shorter , 10 - item document , with specific bills attached to each item that would be passed with a @entity3 victory , was rolled out on the steps of the @entity122 and signed by @entity3 members of @entity9 and candidates			0
the 2010 version has more than 20 items , including changes to how @entity9 works and broad policy goals such as tougher sanctions against @entity130			0
while it does contain legislative proposals , it does not include specific bills that would be introduced and passed if @entity3 gain control of the @entity4			0
introduced at roughly the same time as the previous contract , several weeks before midterm congressional elections , the " @entity5 " will be unveiled at a hardware store in @entity138 , @entity139 , outside @entity0			0
a @entity3 lawmaker involved in putting together the document said @entity4 @entity3 realize that voters are angry with both @entity94 and @entity3			1
the agenda contained in the " @entity5 " is intended to convince such voters that their concerns are taken seriously by @entity3 , who will act differently if returned to power than they did when controlling @entity9 during parts of the @entity150 administration , the legislator said			1
@entity1 's @entity151 contributed to this story .			0
