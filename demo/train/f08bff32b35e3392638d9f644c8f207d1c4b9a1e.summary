-- optimism is all the rage			1
the enthusiastic cheer of motivational speakers has now received a seal of approval from scientists			2
so , apparently it 's confirmed : optimism is good for you			1
but before we rush full speed down the rah - rah route , let us pause for a moment and see exactly which road we take			0
we should n't confuse the power of positive thinking with the dangerous delusion of wishful thinking			2
they end at very different destinations			0
it 's a lesson for countries , politicians , business people and all of us			2
optimism by itself can be dangerous			2
it must always travel in the company of action , common sense , resourcefulness and considered risk - taking			2
" it 's all good , " that irritating , relatively new expression , seems to always come after a description of just how not good it all is ; a desperate effort to make the truth go away			1
it 's the new version of " do n't worry , be happy			1
" in reality , a little worrying can lead to action , which is the principal way optimism bears fruit			1
one of the most inspiring and even charming traits of the @entity47 is its founding and enduring spirit of optimism			2
no doubt , it 's a little less visible now , replaced by cynicism			2
but @entity47 was built on a philosophical foundation of not sitting back and accepting unacceptable outcomes , instead standing up to build a better world			0
that 's the right kind of optimism			1
it 's the one that leads to sensible risk - taking			1
it acknowledges that you do n't always win , that when things do n't turn out well , you try a different approach and then another until you find a solution , until you reach a new continent , until you write the right constitution , until you invent the right machine			1
ireporter : @entity72 chair says she 's ' pretty happy ' with economy -- i 'm appalled it 's the opposite of defeatism			1
and it 's very different from denial or wishful thinking			2
optimism without thoughtful and determined action can lead to disaster			1
it 's true for individuals , it 's true for business , and it 's true for nations			2
history is full of examples			0
the poster boy for off - the - rails , disastrous optimism is @entity94 , the @entity95 prime minister who met with @entity96 in 1938 and handed him a big chunk of @entity98 in exchange for the @entity101 's word			1
he did n't ask the @entity103 people what they thought , but he was giddy with excitement when he got off the plane from @entity108 waving a piece of paper he and " @entity96 " had signed			2
" i believe it is peace for our time , " he immortally declared			0
when appeasement was inevitably followed by a most horrific , brutal war , we saw a different kind of optimism , the kind that rolls up its sleeves , defies the odds and makes its own luck			2
@entity122 , who presided over a country with a third - rate army , ordered an industrial transformation of the @entity47 economy on a scale that seemed simply out of reach , with the focused , urgent aim of defeating the @entity130			1
he declared , " let no man say it can not be done			0
" many muttered that it could n't			2
but the country got to work			0
the @entity47 met production goals that were almost inconceivably ambitious			0
and it turned the tide of war			0
the first case ( @entity94 ) was optimism supported by wishful thinking , as useful as buying a lottery ticket to fend off bankruptcy			1
the second ( @entity122 ) was optimism propelled by determined action and smart planning			1
this is the one that works			0
optimism can take the distasteful tone of arrogance , or it can sound like the sunny chirps of the brainwashed			0
either one of these can lead to disaster			0
it 's only the optimism that reasons , that considers courses of action and different potential outcomes , that pushes ahead , which truly leads to greatness			1
naked optimism is the currency of casinos in @entity171			0
it 's the attitude of overgrown children raised on large servings of phony self - esteem			0
it 's the view of the world -- or of one 's own talents -- that ignores the fact that everyone gets it wrong sometimes ; that no matter how smart you are , there are always events that will remain out of your control , that there are always things you do not know , and there are always some people who are smarter than you			1
it 's this kind of arrogance passing for self - confident optimism that gave us the economic mess we have had for the past five years			1
it 's the optimism that falsely promised home prices could only go up , so we should borrow as much as possible , regardless of income ; a confidence that boasted that complicated financial ideas and convoluted market hedging made for bulletproof @entity205 portfolios			1
we know where all that optimism took us			0
the ones who predicted disaster , the ones who saw a major collapse coming , were the ones who got it right			0
they were the ones who became superstars			0
yes , sometimes the pessimists are right			0
but the optimists can learn from them			0
the action - oriented optimists , the ones who do n't see life as a casino but as a place where one has to make the right decisions to obtain the desired outcomes -- to make the world a better place or our lives more worth living -- see disasters as occasions to learn , to find out what we should have done differently , to come up with new strategies			1
scientists tell us that scans show our brains are wired for optimism			1
we register positive lessons more than negative ones			0
and that 's partly , they say , because optimism is good for our health			1
but science goes on , and scientists often change their minds			0
what is true now and always will be is that things do n't always go the way we want			1
people do n't always do what we would like			0
and life , like history , politics , the economy and the stock market , is full of surprises , including some very painful ones			0
so , we ca n't simply sit back and wait optimistically for everything to work out			1
we need to do our part to make the stories have happy endings			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity275 .			0

@entity277 : scientists tell us optimism is good for us . let 's not be delusional
she says " it 's all good " ignores when things are n't ; worrying leads us to fruitful action
she says @entity94 in @entity288 a good example of blind optimism ; @entity122 example of useful optimism
@entity293 : optimism for suckers ; pessimism often better . we need to work for happy endings
