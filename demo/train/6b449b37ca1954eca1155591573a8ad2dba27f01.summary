@entity0 , @entity1 -- while the economy sputters here on @entity6 , space entrepreneurs in @entity1 are looking to the heavens			2
@entity8 and @entity9 of @entity10 , a not - for - profit that helps aerospace companies test space technology			1
in a cavernous testing facility called the " incubator , " specialized equipment recreates the unique conditions of a journey into space -- from platforms that mimic the violent shaking at liftoff to chambers that replicate space 's bitter cold and complete vacuum			1
this is home to @entity10 : the @entity28 , a not - for - profit partnership between @entity30 , a private aerospace company , and the @entity32			1
launched last month , @entity10 helps fledgling aerospace companies try out new gadgetry and meet @entity36 specifications			1
" one of the most important things in making space hardware is that it 's going to [ have to ] work in space , because you ca n't repair it , " said @entity9 , executive director of @entity10			1
" it 's up there , it has to work			2
" @entity9 believes that in the near future , @entity36 's programs will be supplemented more often by entrepreneurial space ventures			2
he thinks @entity10 can help these companies work toward making space exploration more affordable and accessible to private citizens			1
" our goal is to help small aerospace companies to get off the ground , " said @entity10 director @entity8			1
@entity10 will help entrepreneurs " to commercialize their technology and to help develop the work force that will fuel their growth			2
" the center 's incubator doubles as the headquarters of @entity30 , which @entity9 founded almost by accident more than a dozen years ago			1
he developed a paraffin actuator , a mechanism filled with a waxlike substance that melts when it reaches a certain temperature , flipping a switch			0
the device worked on hot - water heaters , but @entity9 thought it might have high - tech applications elsewhere			0
" i ended up contacting @entity36 and they said yeah , " @entity9 said			0
" so we started building them for spacecraft instead of water heaters , and the business was built around that			0
" but it was n't quite that simple			0
the first actuator for @entity36 cost $ 32,000 to make , and @entity9 had to sell his @entity85 sports car to raise the money			0
also , @entity9 ' specialty was hot water heaters , not spacecraft			0
products for @entity36 have to go through rigorous testing and be made to strict specifications			0
" i knew nothing about it , " he said			0
" we 'd ask @entity36 , ' can we use @entity96 ? ' and they 'd say , ' no , you ca n't use @entity96			0
' " @entity9 ' goal with @entity10 is to help entrepreneurs avoid making the same mistakes			1
@entity10 mentors new companies and helps guide them on the long journey from the workbench in the family garage to the launch pad			1
a important part of the process is access to the sophisticated testing equipment at the incubator , located in a suburb northwest of @entity112			2
" the people making the hardware can test the hardware in that chamber and see if it 's going to work in the harsh conditions of space , " said @entity9 while leading a tour of the facility			1
" this is a half - a - million - dollar chamber			0
that 's not something a small company can afford			2
" @entity8 hopes @entity10 's collaboration with the @entity32 will help guide young engineers into careers in space technology			1
to facilitate this , @entity10 will fund three hands - on projects for graduate students to design aerospace technologies with commercial applications			1
" they have great skills for the aerospace industry , and they would never have thought of going into the aerospace industry but for this program , " @entity8 said			0
a few miles down the road , another space hardware company is hoping to benefit from @entity10 's programs			1
" i think the @entity10 concept is really a very important one , " said @entity144 , executive vice president of @entity145 , which makes resins , thermal insulation and other products			2
" we can be much more effective when we are working with other entrepreneurial companies and combining our capabilities and technologies , " he added			0
" so @entity10 will both create a network of companies and will also help with the educational basics			1
" @entity144 sees huge growth ahead in space technologies and in technologies developed for space making their way back to @entity6			0
high - temperature insulation his company developed for space is being repurposed for use in wind turbines and geothermal equipment			2
in that way , @entity10 could help prepare engineers for a variety of jobs beyond the aerospace field -- a key benefit in a battered economy			1
" the space market is a vital market , and it does require a lot of jobs , " @entity144 told @entity2			0
" but i think it 's quite clear the terrestrial market has more jobs in larger industries			0
we 're going to be needing to hire more and more people			0
