with one vote on friday , the @entity1 - led @entity0 launched the latest spending battle in @entity4 -- one that could bring a government shutdown in less than two weeks			1
by a 230 - 189 tally almost strictly on party lines , the @entity0 passed a short - term government spending plan that would eliminate all funding for @entity10			1
the measure now goes to the @entity13 - led @entity12 , which is certain to reject the provision that defunds president @entity16 's signature legislative achievement of his first term			1
even though @entity18 now have voted 42 times to repeal or otherwise undermine @entity10 , speaker @entity20 and fellow @entity1 held a brief victory rally after friday 's action and challenged the @entity12 to follow their lead			1
" the @entity28 people do n't want the government shut down , and they do n't want @entity10 , " the @entity24 @entity1 said to applause and cheers			1
" @entity0 has listened to the @entity28 people			0
now it 's time for the @entity12 to listen to them as well			0
" in a display of the raw politics of the battle , @entity0 majority leader @entity32 of @entity33 called out @entity37 facing re-election next year by name , asking how sens. @entity40 of @entity41 , @entity42 of @entity43 , @entity44 of @entity45 and @entity46 of @entity47 will vote on the @entity0 proposal			1
" it 's up to @entity37 to follow @entity0 republicans and show some responsibility , " @entity32 said			1
later friday , @entity16 accused conservative @entity1 of holding the nation hostage by trying to make passing a federal budget and increasing the debt ceiling contingent on defunding health care reforms			1
" you do n't have to threaten to blow the whole thing up if you do n't get your way , " @entity16 said in a campaign - style speech at a @entity58 plant in the @entity59 , @entity60 area , adding that legislators in @entity62 were focused on politics and " trying to mess with me , " rather than helping the middle class			2
in legislative jargon , the @entity0 passed a continuing resolution that would keep the government funded for the first 11 weeks of the fiscal year that begins october 1			1
without some kind of spending measure by then , parts of the government would have to curtail services or shut down			2
government shutdown : again ? seriously ? conservatives tie @entity10 to budget talks the controversy involves the provision demanded by the @entity1 's conservative wing and agreed to by @entity20 that eliminates all funding for the 2010 health care reforms popularly known as @entity10			1
approval by the @entity0 set in motion a @entity88 showdown that will continue through october , when the nation 's debt ceiling must be increased so the government can pay all its bills			1
the two - stage process includes the possible government shutdown at the end of the current fiscal year on september 30 if there is no compromise on a spending resolution , followed by a potentially even more rancorous debate over raising the debt ceiling			1
@entity32 said friday the @entity0 would consider a one - year debt ceiling measure next week that contains other conservative - backed proposals , expected to include postponing implementation of @entity10 for a year and approving the @entity106 oil pipeline from @entity107			1
@entity16 , however , rejected playing politics with the debt ceiling , which is the limit for how much the federal government can borrow to pay bills it owes			2
" this is not a deadbeat nation			0
we do n't run out on our tab , " the president said , calling even the threat of not raising the debt ceiling " the height of irresponsibility			0
" he also made a point of telling the auto workers that raising the debt ceiling " does n't cost a dime " and " does not add a penny to our deficits			0
" " all it says is , you got ta pay for what @entity4 already said we 're spending money on , " @entity16 said , adding that " if you do n't do it , we could have another financial crisis			2
" @entity135 conservatives who have pledged to fight implementation of @entity10 consider the current budget debate their last major chance to undermine it , because the brunt of the new system takes effect with the start of fiscal year 2014 on october 1			1
they demand a halt to funding all programs from the @entity145 , and they seem indifferent about forcing a government shutdown if that does n't happen			0
" i will do everything necessary and anything possible to defund @entity10 , " @entity1 sen. @entity148 of @entity149 said thursday , threatening a filibuster and " any procedural means necessary			1
" however , more moderate republicans in the @entity13 - led @entity12 call the defunding effort a waste of time			1
veteran @entity1 sen. @entity157 of @entity158 told @entity159 on thursday that because of the chamber 's @entity13 majority , " we will not repeal or defund @entity10 " in the @entity12 " and to think we can is not rational			2
" in addition , the @entity162 said thursday that @entity16 would veto the @entity0 spending resolution defunding @entity10 if it reaches his desk			1
an earlier compromise proposed by @entity20 and fellow @entity168 leaders to their conservative wing would have allowed a symbolic vote on the defunding provision that the @entity12 would then strip out			0
the result would have been what legislators call a " clean " final version that simply extended current levels of government spending for about two months of the new fiscal year , allowing time for further negotiations on the debt ceiling			0
worries about @entity10 ? fear not however , conservative opposition to the compromise made @entity20 agree to a tougher version that made overall government funding contingent on eliminating money for @entity10			2
moderate @entity1 question the strategy , but fear a right - wing backlash in the 2014 primaries if they go against the conservative wing			2
in reference to the divisions in the @entity0 , @entity157 said it is " pretty obvious that ( @entity20 ) has great difficulties within his own conference			0
" on the @entity0 floor on friday , legislators warned of the serious consequences of a government shutdown			0
the last shutdown , which occurred during the @entity202 administration more than 17 years ago , comprised a total of 28 days and cost the nation more than $ 1 billion , according to congressional researchers			0
@entity207 @entity206 of @entity208 said the intent of the @entity1 measure is to shut down the government , calling it a " wolf in wolf 's clothing			2
" @entity1 rep. @entity215 of @entity216 , who chairs the @entity217 , said " a government shutdown is a political game in which everyone loses			0
" " it shirks one of our most basic duties as members of @entity4 and it puts our national security at stake , " he added			0
opinion : the real problem with @entity10 republicans said the @entity0 vote showed bipartisan support for defunding @entity10 because two @entity37 backed the @entity1 resolution -- reps			1
@entity235 of @entity236 and @entity237 of @entity47			0
meanwhile , rep. @entity238 of @entity33 was the lone @entity1 to break ranks with his caucus by voting against it			0
in the @entity12 , majority leader @entity242 of @entity243 made clear on thursday that any plan to defund @entity10 would be dead on arrival			0
instead , the @entity12 is expected to strip the measure of all provisions defunding @entity10 and send it back to the @entity0			1
" they 're simply postponing an inevitable choice they must face , " @entity242 said of @entity0 republicans			0
@entity20 would then have to decide whether to put it to a vote , even though that could undermine his already weakened leadership position by having the measure pass with only a few dozen moderate republicans joining @entity37 in support			2
if he refuses to bring the @entity12 version to the floor for a vote , a shutdown would ensue			0
" will he act as the captain of the entire @entity0 or remain a captive of his right wing @entity1 mates ? " asked @entity13 rep. @entity261 of @entity262			2
" will he , as he acts , worry mainly about the risk to his speakership or the risk to our entire nation ? @entity0 @entity1 taking the ship over the cliff would take the nation 's economic well - being with it			1
" polls showing a decrease in public support for the health care reforms embolden the @entity1 stance			0
meanwhile , @entity13 resolve is bolstered by surveys showing most people oppose a government shutdown and more would blame republicans if it happens			0
@entity0 @entity1 : defund @entity10 or shut government down shutdown scenario voices across the political spectrum warn against a shutdown , including @entity292 director @entity291 , @entity294 chairman @entity293 , the @entity295 , and @entity1 strategist @entity296			1
" even the defund strategy 's authors say they do n't want a government shutdown			0
but their approach means we 'll get one , " @entity296 argued in an op - ed published thursday by the @entity300 .			0
