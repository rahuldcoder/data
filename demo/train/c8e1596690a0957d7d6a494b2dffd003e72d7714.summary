-- e-books are revolutionizing the publishing industry and reader preferences , and @entity4 might be in a unique position to hasten that change -- if they decide to start giving away their popular @entity9 e-reader for free			1
here 's why they might want to do that			2
last year , nearly $ 1 billion in e-books were sold , according to @entity15			2
by 2015 , this is expected to jump to $ 3 billion			0
that 's an awful lot of money to be made selling e-books			1
at that point , selling e-readers at any price might just become an obstacle to selling more e-books			1
so why not just give away some e-readers for free ? back in october 2009 , blogger @entity26 noticed that the @entity9 price -- currently $ 139 -- was falling steadily			1
by june 2010 this rate was so consistent that he projected that by november 2011 the @entity9 price should be $ 0			1
last summer , author @entity29 asked @entity4 ceo @entity30 about this projection			1
according to @entity29 , @entity30 " merely smiled and said , ' oh , you noticed that ! ' and then smiled again			0
" in a way , @entity4 has already been giving away kindles for awhile -- in the form of the free @entity9 smartphone , tablet , and computer apps			1
right now , about 6 million @entity42 adults own e-readers -- but this field is getting much more crowded			2
according to recent research from @entity46 , @entity9 currently holds 47 % of the e-reader market			1
@entity49 's @entity48 ( which is much more than an e-reader , so i 'm not sure that 's a fair comparison ) holds only 32 % of this market			2
@entity55 's @entity54 , at 5 % , is just barely leading the @entity56 , at 4 %			0
plus , @entity57 recently acquired @entity58 , so it 'll be interesting to see what that yields on the e-reader front			0
the @entity9 's core business model has always been to sell books , not devices			1
so a free @entity9 seems like a potentially savvy business move			1
@entity15 analyst @entity66 recently noted : " just 7 % of online adults who read books read e-books			2
but that 7 % happens to be a very attractive bunch : they read the most books and spend the most money on books			0
and here 's the kicker : the average e-book reader already consumes 41 % of books in digital form			0
" oh , and that includes the people who do n't have an e-reader yet , which is nearly half of them			0
for those that have a kindle or other e-reader , they read 66 % of their books digitally			0
@entity66 believes the e-book market has plenty of room for growth and will , by conservative estimates , reach $ 3 billion by the middle of the decade			2
all e-readers , including the @entity9 , have their pros and cons -- not the least of which are concerns about digital rights management , and whether you can loan or sell your used e-books			1
but if @entity4 does n't offer free e-readers , someone certainly will			1
i 'm sure @entity4 wishes to maintain its market lead			1
here are three ways they might do that : 1			0
buy x number of @entity9 books , get a @entity9 free and maybe the kindle books you 've already bought to read on your phone , tablet , or computer might count toward that benchmark			1
free kindles for @entity122 members millions of @entity4 customers already pay $ 79/year to get free two - day shipping on many items , plus ( now ) free video streaming			1
@entity127 speculated on this a year ago			0
partner @entity9 giveaways already some banks have started giving away kindles to customers			1
but here 's a more intriguing option , from the @entity135 : " the @entity136 , if it stopped printing a physical edition of the paper , could afford to give every subscriber a free @entity9			1
" not the standard @entity9 , but the one with free global data access			1
and not just one @entity9 , but four @entity131			1
and not just once , but every year			0
and that 's using the low estimate for the costs of [ their ] printing			0
" personally , i think free e-reader devices , if they worked with library e-book lending programs ( like the one in @entity149 , @entity150 ) and open e-book formats ( like			0
pdf ) -- could help increase access to books for youths , seniors and low - income communities			0
for many in these groups , smartphones and tablets are too expensive or complicated , and it 's not always easy to get to the public library -- especially if , as in @entity149 and @entity166 , public library hours are being steadily whittled away			2
as a matter of fact , i 'm writing this article sitting in the former card catalog room of @entity171 on the campus of the @entity173 in @entity166			0
it 's a gorgeous space , all four walls lined with built - in wooden card catalog drawers , stacked six feet high			0
every one of those drawers is empty			0
like in most libraries today , students now search the library catalog from computer terminals			0
but they still must go to the shelves to get their books			0
with free e-readers , maybe libraries could be everywhere , and open all the time			2
hmm , maybe @entity4 would n't like that so much			2
but if their e-book market was big enough , they probably would n't care			2
the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity193 .			0

@entity4 is in a unique position to hasten the change in the publishing industry
selling e-readers at any price might just become an obstacle to selling more e-books
the @entity9 price has fallen steadily anyway since it came on the market
