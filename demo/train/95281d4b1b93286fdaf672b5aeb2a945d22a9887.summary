-- there is nothing terribly surprising in @entity4 's refreshed line of tablets , but that 's ok			1
we spent some time testing and touching the new @entity8 and @entity9 after tuesday 's press conference			1
as promised by @entity4 executives , the new devices were lighter , thinner and seemingly faster -- just like many incremental product upgrades from the past			1
@entity9 there were no major new features , such as the fingerprint scanner or camera upgrade that came with the @entity19			2
the most unexpected news of the day was a new name for the $ 499 fifth - generation @entity9 , which is now the @entity9			1
the @entity9 line has been a bit wishy - washy with names			1
it began by counting each version , but then dropped the number and asked only to be know as " @entity9 , " like @entity27			2
the @entity9 2 kept its number and a spot in stores , where its slightly lower price tag ( now $ 399 ) might appeal to someone considering a cheaper @entity34 or @entity35 tablet			2
physically , the @entity9 is indeed lighter and thinner than its predecessor			1
it 's 20 % thinner than the third generation ipad , measuring in at a slight .29 - inch			1
an ad shown at the press conference showed an @entity9 lying flat on a tablet , hiding discretely behind a no. 2 pencil			2
it has also dropped a bit of weight and the @entity45 version is now exactly 1 pound ( the cellular version is 1.05 pounds )			0
unfortunately , i did n't have an older ipad on hand to do a weight comparison , and i 'd picked up an @entity8 first			1
nothing makes a regular @entity9 feel hefty like holding an @entity8			1
you ca n't unfeel a @entity8 ; it 's just so delightfully wee			1
the @entity9 has a 64 - bit a7 processor , the same chip recently introduced in the @entity19			1
the @entity55 should benefit graphics heavy programs such as @entity58 and @entity59 , and @entity60 claimed it would double the performance of the previous chip			0
it is difficult to judge speed increases during a few minutes in a crowded room without proper tests and an equally empty previous generation device to use for comparison			1
fresh @entity4 products always feel zippier than previous generations			2
part of that is the steadily improving processors inside , but its also the benefit of working on a new device that has n't been gradually slowed down by pages of apps , hundreds of cat videos and the latest operating system upgrade			0
@entity8 with @entity80 the @entity8 got its first upgrade since it was first launched one year ago			0
physically , the device is a dead ringer for the original			0
fire it up , and you 'll see that it addresses one of the biggest complaints about the first version by upgrading the screen to a 2048 - by - 1536 display that packs in 326 pixels per inch , a big jump from the previous 163 pixels per inch			2
a number of @entity4 products already have the @entity80 : the @entity97 and up , the fourth generation @entity99 , the 10 - inch @entity9 and some @entity100			1
( @entity4 says @entity80 is so good that the human eye ca n't spot out individual pixels on the device )			2
like the @entity9 , the @entity8 with @entity104 has the @entity55 chip inside			1
previously the @entity8 was a generation behind its larger @entity9 sibling in processor speed			1
but this upgrade and the new display put the devices on the same level , so picking a smaller screen no longer means opting for the inferior product			0
the smaller tablet size is a competitive market , and the @entity8 with @entity80 is finally @entity4 's premium offering for the 7.9 - inch size			1
the $ 399 tablet is now in a better position to take on products such as @entity122 's @entity121 , @entity125 's @entity124 tablets and @entity127 's @entity126			0
though other products can usually be had for much less , any hands - on time with @entity4 products remind you that one of their greatest selling points is solid , high - quality construction			1
the missing upgrade shaving off excess bulk and swapping out faster processors is de rigueur for any product update these days			0
other companies might throw in price drops , but @entity4 is comfortable in its spot at the high - end of the consumer market			2
it wo n't start slashing devices for its flagship devices			0
instead , the company keeps older models available , though even those are priced somewhat high			0
unfortunately , there is one key feature where all the tablet makers seem to have stalled : battery life			0
faster processors gobble up more battery power , so maintaining 10 hours of battery life from an old tablet to a new tablet probably requires battery improvements			0
both new @entity159 have the same @entity161 motion co-processor that handles sensors , such as the accelerometer and gyroscope , saving battery power by not using the main processor			2
other than an hour here or there , mobile devices makers seem stuck at the half - day mark , a frustrating limitation for people who have adapted by carting around chargers and scrambling to re-up anytime they spot an empty outlet at a cafe , airport or friend 's house			0
for now , @entity4 is comfortable enough with the competition to just iterate on its well - designed , popular products , making the usual round of improvements and throwing in the occasional flashy feature to grab attention , such as fingerprints on the @entity19			1
it may not be as much fun for tech fans who were used to splashy new products and well - kept secrets , but it 's probably a solid business decision			0
according to @entity194 analyst @entity193 , replacement tablet sales are growing faster than new new tablet sales worldwide			0
manufacturers need to compete to keep the customers they already have who are considering upgrading from an old model			0
all the tablet makers are competing with what are essentially the same minor tweaks			0
the competition will stay close until the first company breaks out of the usual faster , thinner , faster upgrade cycle and solves the battery problem .			0

the new @entity159 from @entity4 do n't hold a lot of surprises , but the regular improvements are solid
the *renamed* @entity9 is thinner , faster and lighter than the previous generation
with a new processor and better screen , @entity8 catches up to the full - size ipad
