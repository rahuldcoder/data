seven moments that defined @entity6 's managerial career @entity6 paid tribute to the club 's " players and staff , past and present , " thanking them " for a staggering level of professional conduct and dedication that has helped to deliver so many memorable triumphs			2
without their contribution the history of this great club would not be as rich			0
" he also expressed gratitude to his own family , the @entity57 family , and the club 's many supporters , at home and abroad			0
" @entity6 has proven time and time again what a fantastic manager he is but he 's also a wonderful person			1
his determination to succeed and dedication to the club have been truly remarkable , " @entity57 said			0

" ' @entity145 success ' @entity146 , editor of @entity147 , told @entity1 he considers @entity6 to be unsurpassed as a manager in his time			1
" in the modern era , where 's he 's dealt with the players on huge salaries and the corporate world that is now football , he has had extraordinary success , " he said			0
" he 's tough and uncompromising and , i think , completely dedicated to being a winner			0
" whoever takes over at @entity55 has a hard act to follow , @entity146 said -- but @entity7 will have been planning carefully for this moment			2
" there will definitely be someone in place , i think -- the big question now is who that person will be because it 's been kept a secret from everyone until now , " @entity146 said			0
whoever it will be has a daunting , if exciting , prospect ahead			0
" it 's the largest football club in the world , it 's the biggest management job in the world , and on top of that is the task of following the most successful manager in the club 's history , " @entity146 said			0

health concerns ? fans ' thoughts are bound to turn quickly to the 2013 - 2014 season , starting in september , as @entity7 prepares to defend its domestic title and attempts another win in @entity200			1
as recently as last week , @entity6 suggested that he was fully involved in those future plans , promising the club would be " competitive " in the summer transfer market			2
speaking to @entity204 , the club 's official magazine , @entity6 said : " hopefully the players we bring into the club in the next year or so will be of the quality we need			2

@entity6 is due to undergo hip surgery this summer , according to @entity27 media reports , but it 's not clear how much of a role health concerns have played in his decision to stand down			1
" i think retirement 's for young people because you can do something else			0
when you get to my age , if your health is good , you like to work , " he told @entity1 in a 2010 interview			0
sports writer @entity226 said he was surprised by the timing of @entity6 's decision , despite his upcoming surgery , saying he had expected him to carry on as manager for another couple of years			1
@entity6 -- who is seen as a kind of father figure by some of the young players he developed -- has " that ability to reach out to people , " said @entity226 , but he is also a skilled political operator			2
" he could be delightful but he was a man who made sure that he controlled the agenda , " he told @entity1			0
" if you crossed his path he made it very clear that he controlled everything at @entity7			2
" those who got the famous " hairdryer treatment " -- loud shouting directly in someone 's face -- included many sports journalists over the years			0
@entity6 would also refuse to speak to reporters if he did n't like what they said			2
despite that thorny relationship , @entity6 will be remembered as an iconic figure in @entity4 football history , said @entity226			2
the big challenge now is how @entity7 will manage the transition to ensure continued success , he added			2
' a sad day ' former @entity7 and @entity258 goalkeeper @entity257 told @entity1 he was still trying to make sense of the news			1
" it is a sad day			0
i 'm shocked , i 'm sad , i 'm disappointed			0
it 's a day i think everyone who loves @entity7 , everyone who 's worked with sir @entity6 -- it 's a day that we 've been expecting , but i have to be honest i did n't think it would be now -- i thought it would be a couple of years down the line			1
" @entity257 said he was certain that @entity6 had not been forced out but had made the decision himself , given his record of success and changes already happening on the club 's board this summer			1
he paid tribute to @entity6 's knowledge , skills and philosophy as a manager , particularly his ability to bring on young players			1
internationally known footballers like @entity281 , @entity282 , @entity283 , @entity284 and @entity285 were all created by @entity6 , @entity257 said			2
" he is the best manager in the world and he 's the best guy as well			0
he 's a really good friend as well			0
" @entity6 's talent has been in managing players individually rather than as a group , @entity257 said			2
" the end result is that everyone plays really well for the team , " @entity257 said			0
" yes , he can be hard , he can be tough			0
... in a way he becomes your second dad			0
he has to educate you in life , he has to prepare you for what comes next in life after football			0
" ' vision , energy , ability ' @entity303 , who will step down as chief executive of @entity7 in june , said it had been a " tremendous pleasure " to work alongside @entity6 over the past 16 years			1
" we knew that his retirement would come one day and we both have been planning for it by ensuring the quality of the squad and club structures are in first class condition , " he said			0
" @entity6 's vision , energy and ability have built teams -- both on and off the pitch -- that his successor can count on as among the best and most loyal in world sport			2
" @entity6 began his career on the soccer pitch , playing for @entity324 clubs @entity325 , @entity326 , @entity327 , @entity328 , @entity329 and @entity330			2
but it was when he returned to the game as a manager , working at @entity334 , @entity335 and then @entity336 that people really began to take notice			2
he led @entity336 to three @entity324 titles , four @entity324 cups , one @entity341 and one @entity342 before moving to @entity7 in november 1986 following the dismissal of former manager @entity344			1
it did n't take long for the @entity345 to start turning things round at a club that was then near the bottom of the league			0
since then , @entity6 has dominated the @entity4 game -- his string of victories making him , according to the @entity7 website , " the most successful manager in @entity27 football history			1
" @entity1 's @entity356 and @entity357 contributed to this report .			0
