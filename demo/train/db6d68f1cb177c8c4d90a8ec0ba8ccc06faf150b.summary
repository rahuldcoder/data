-- @entity1 kept the world on tenterhooks wednesday , when the funeral of leader @entity4 was expected to take place in @entity6			1
on wednesday morning , state television began broadcasting previously aired video of @entity4 's son @entity9 and other mourners paying respects in front of the late dictator as his corpse lay in state			1
the secretive nation had revealed no details about the funeral , where thousands of @entity1 were expected to file past a glass case housing the body of the elder @entity4 , revered as a godlike " dear leader " by his people			1
state television on wednesday morning also showed historical footage recounting the life of @entity4 , from the legend of his birth on a sacred mountain to his years as leader of the communist state			1
@entity4 's funeral likely will be modeled after that of his father , @entity34 , in 1994 , said @entity35 , a professor at the @entity37 's @entity36 who is also director of the @entity39 for the @entity40			1
however , the funeral is expected to spotlight his son @entity9 , the man designated the " great successor " by the nation 's @entity45			1
questions have been raised about @entity9 's ability to take the reins of the reclusive communist nation , given his young age -- he is thought to be in his late 20s -- and relative inexperience			2
" the system will try to make sure that @entity9 , this young man , is a legitimate leader , so probably he will be spotlighted in the funeral procession , " said @entity35			2
while there is no official religion in @entity1 , the funeral will probably touch on the @entity60 tradition of ancestor worship , @entity35 said			2
@entity62 , a @entity1 analyst at the @entity63 in @entity64 , said observers outside @entity1 will be performing " the usual @entity66 -- except in this case it 's @entity68			1
" they will be watching the ceremonies for clues as to where leading figures stand in the new hierarchy , comparing the event to the 1994 funeral of @entity1 's founder , @entity34			1
" what i expect to see is no sign that there 's any hiccup or difficulty in @entity4 's plan to have his son @entity9 succeed him , " @entity62 said			1
among those expected to be at the side of the " great successor " are his aunt and uncle			2
the late ruler 's sister , @entity90 , and her husband , @entity91 , are expected to serve as regents for the young @entity4 as he builds leadership experience , @entity62 said			1
" they will be very prominently featured in all of the public ceremonies , " he said			0
" they 'll have places that are very close to @entity9			0
if it was otherwise , it would be a dramatic new development , but i do n't expect that			2
" the ceremony is to be followed by a memorial on thursday			0
the state - run @entity104 said when the national memorial service is held thursday , gun volleys will be fired in the capital , @entity6 , as well as provincial seats			0
" all the people will observe three minutes ' silence and all locomotives and ships ( those on voyage included ) will blow whistles and those units with sirens will sound them all at once , " @entity104 said			0
while the public " outpouring of grief " will be present at the funeral , it may not be as overwhelming as it was following the death of @entity34 , said @entity35 , who has visited @entity1 frequently and is in close contact with high - ranking officials there			0
as loved as he might be among the @entity1 people , he said , " @entity4 is no @entity34			1
" @entity34 was much more charismatic , and his death was much more unexpected , he said			0
while @entity34 was 83 to @entity4 's 69 , the elder @entity4 was thought to be in excellent health			1
" two weeks before his death , ( @entity34 ) received @entity130 , " @entity35 said , referring to the former @entity129 president			0
" in @entity1 , no one actually anticipated or suspected the coming of his death ... @entity4 , his health was failing			1
" the glass case to house @entity4 's body was ready upon his death , he said			1
in @entity34 's case , " it took days ... to make that arrangement preparation			0
" and @entity141 , research fellow at @entity143 's @entity142 , said @entity9 is " following a script laid out by his father , " who had a major stroke in 2008			2
" basically , we are seeing a man who planned his own funeral , " he said			0
@entity1 has said the funeral will be a " low - key " affair , with no foreign heads of state invited , @entity141 said			0
that 's " the one factor that @entity4 could n't control " -- the possible embarrassment , if invitations were issued , that heads of state might not accept			1
one point of interest will be who is going to be in the @entity162 delegation , @entity141 said			0
" that will be done through party - to - party connection , " with those attending likely to be a senior representative of the @entity168			0
there have been rumors that @entity162 president @entity171 may attend , he said			0
@entity141 believes if @entity171 shows up , he will use the title of party general secretary , not president			0
and one notable omission from the guest list is @entity4 's oldest son , @entity177 , who fell from favor after being caught trying to sneak a visit to @entity180 using a forged passport			1
he told @entity183 's @entity182 in 2010 that he opposed having his family hold power for another generation , but had " no objection nor interest " in the matter			0
@entity62 said @entity4 now lives in the @entity162 casino haven of @entity191 and is " more or less exiled			2
" " it 's rather significant that in a confucian society , the oldest son wo n't play a significant role in the funeral , " he said			1
" that speaks to a very strained relationship between him and the current leadership			0
" @entity35 referred to " government by legacy " in @entity1			0
when @entity4 succeeded his father , he also inherited much of @entity34 's policies and philosophies , which have been " the backbone of policy - making , " he said			1
because of that , neither he nor @entity62 said they expect to see drastic policy changes under @entity9			0
observers say upcoming events will also provide @entity1 with opportunities to reinforce the succession and provide a window on how smoothly that process is going			2
@entity216 , senior fellow for @entity1 studies and director of the program on @entity129 - @entity1 policy for the @entity221 , wrote tuesday that the leader 's upcoming @entity223 's address may already have been written , " but can be scoured for deviations from the past and for evidence of possible rewriting @entity229 's death			2
" @entity9 's first birthday as leader , on january 8 , may also provide some clues			2
so could @entity4 's 70th birthday on february 16 -- still within the mourning period -- or the 100th birthday of @entity34 on april 15			1
@entity0 's @entity236 contributed to this report .			0

observers will be watching the funeral for succession clues , analyst says
@entity4 's eldest son is a notable omission from the guest list , he says
@entity4 's funeral is expected to follow the *template* of his father 's in 1994
experts say no dramatic policy changes are likely in the short term
