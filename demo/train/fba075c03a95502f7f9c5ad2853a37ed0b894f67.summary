further criticism of the police response after the @entity46 bombings came wednesday from the human rights group @entity72			1
it accused the " poorly trained and ill - equipped " police of carrying out extra-judicial killings and other violations in response to @entity6 's attacks			1
" @entity6 has perpetrated numerous human rights abuses and shows contempt for life , but the security forces have failed to prevent , investigate , prosecute or punish these acts and have often carried out new human rights violations with impunity , " @entity72 said in a statement			1
suspected @entity6 members who have been rounded up have not been tried , and innocent women and children have been detained to gain information about male relatives suspected of offenses , the group said			2
" investigations into crimes , if they occur , are often inadequate and not intelligence - led , " @entity72 said			1
@entity2 asked the @entity1 government repeatedly for comment on accusations of extra-judicial killings but has received no official response			1
the accusations have also come from civilians caught up in the police activity			0
" we are in a state of fear and turbulence , " the mother of a missing man and his pregnant wife told @entity2 in an audio - only interview			0
she asked not to be identified because she was scared to criticize the government on camera			0
neighbors said the couple was at home when security forces opened fire , demanding he let them in			0
the mother said her son 's quran was scattered and destroyed and she found blood pooled by the bedroom door			0
despite repeated requests to authorities , she said , no one has told her where her son and his wife are or whether they are still alive			0
" my son is not a member of @entity6 , " the mother said			2
" had there been justice , they would have arrested him and paraded him before a court of law			0
this is a jungle justice			0
" @entity6 was formed in 2002 by @entity28 preacher @entity140 as an outgrowth of ethnic tensions in the country in the 1990s			2
