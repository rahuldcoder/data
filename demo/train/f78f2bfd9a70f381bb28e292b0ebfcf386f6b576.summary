-- the @entity4 virus has been confirmed in a sample taken from a pig that was displayed at the @entity7 , the first time the virus has been found in a @entity2 pig , the @entity2 @entity1 said monday			1
the @entity1 quickly issued a statement saying the food supply is safe			1
" we have fully engaged our trading partners to remind them that several international organizations , including the @entity17 , have advised that there is no scientific basis to restrict trade in pork and pork products , " agriculture secretary @entity12 said in the statement			1
" people can not get this flu from eating pork or pork products			1
pork is safe to eat			2
" the announcement came three days after health officials announced that three pigs that were displayed during the fair had tested positive in a preliminary test for the h1n1 flu virus			1
final results on the other two pigs have not been announced			0
" this , of course , may be the first indication that it is present in some swine here in the @entity2 , " @entity35 , commissioner of the @entity36 @entity1 , told reporters in a conference call on friday			1
the @entity2 @entity1 national veterinary services laboratories conducted the confirmatory testing on the sample collected at the fair , held in @entity48 , @entity36 , between august 26 and september 1			1
the pigs sampled showed no signs of sickness and were apparently healthy , the officials said			0
the samples collected were part of a joint @entity57 and @entity58 research project funded by the @entity59 to determine whether animals at such events had the infection			0
" like people , swine routinely get sick or contract influenza viruses , " @entity12 said			0
the misconception that the virus , sometimes called the swine flu , could be contracted through eating pork has hurt sales of the meat in the wake of the expanding pandemic			2
this year 's crowd of 1.79 million attendees was a record			0
though an outbreak of @entity4 was reported among a group of 4 - @entity80 who had attended the fair , officials said it was unlikely they contracted the virus from the animals , since few of them had contact with the pigs			1
the report came as no surprise to experts , since herds in other countries , including @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 , have been infected with @entity4			2
pigs that do get sick with @entity4 typically recover from it , the officials said			2
the officials said the display animals likely were sent to slaughter			0
even if they were slaughtered while still infected , that would not be an issue for anyone eating the meat , said dr. @entity107 , co-director of the @entity108 and @entity109			0
" this virus is not in muscle tissue , so if these animals were slaughtered or processed there would be no risk to the public			0
" a vaccine to protect swine from @entity4 is under development but is not yet commercially available , one official said .			0

first time the virus has been found in a @entity2 pig , @entity1 says
pork and pork products still safe to eat , agriculture secretary says
