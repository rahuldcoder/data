@entity0 , @entity1 -- the cheering was raucous and the applause thunderous for a man who makes few public appearances			2
as he made his way gingerly across a gravel park , where he had just dedicated a nearly 40 - foot statue representing the " @entity11 , " a voice shouted out : " i love you , @entity14			1
" @entity14 , a @entity15 businessman , is the founder of a national chain of yoga and wellness centers called @entity19			1
the company teaches that its physical exercises " can restore the vibrations of the body and brain to their original , healthy frequencies , " according to a video introduction on its web site			1
but @entity19 is now defending itself from allegations by former employees that it is " a totalistic , high - demand cult group " that demands large sums of money from its followers and enshrines @entity14 as an " absolute spiritual and temporal leader			1
" a lawsuit , filed in a federal court in @entity1 , says that recruits " are unknowingly subjected to an intensive program of psychological manipulation , indoctrination and various techniques of coercive thought reform designed to induce them to become @entity14 's disciples and devote themselves to serving him and his ' vision			1
' " @entity48 , one of more than two dozen plaintiffs in the lawsuit , said @entity19 leaders " prey upon people like me who are ignorant about the way money works			1
" the company denies the allegations and calls the plaintiffs " disgruntled former employees			1
" " in our 30 - year history , we have helped millions of people lead healthier and happier lives , " corporate spokesman @entity58 told @entity2			2
@entity19 set up its first shop in the @entity63 in 1991 , in @entity64 , @entity65			1
it now has 127 storefront centers in the @entity63 , more than 1,000 worldwide , and @entity67 estimates the company 's 2009 profits at $ 34 million			1
@entity19 teaches that what it calls brain wave vibration can ease some of the debilitating symptoms of illnesses such as diabetes and arthritis			1
its publicity materials feature praise for @entity14 from a variety of sources , including @entity80 , @entity82 's president and a @entity84 winner ; and @entity87 producer / choreographer @entity85			2
in addition , @entity89 , a clinical professor of neurology at @entity92 's medical school , praises the work of the @entity95 , a group @entity14 founded			1
" @entity97 is in a unique position to disseminate knowledge and to serve as a very effective platform for numerous worthwhile projects , " @entity89 is quoted on the @entity19 web site as saying			1
" @entity14 should be applauded for his pioneering creative vision in conceiving and launching this innovative organization with a truly international outreach			0
" @entity89 did not respond to requests for comment from @entity2			0
@entity48 and other former employees say @entity19 instructors coerced them into taking out student loans , then transferring the funds to the company			1
payments began in small amounts , she said , then progressively increased as fees for training and courses became more expensive			0
@entity48 said she eventually paid about $ 40,000 to @entity117			0
@entity58 said no one was ever coerced into giving money to @entity19			1
the former employees " have misinterpreted natural business cycles , natural business goals , as some type of undue pressure , " he said			2
" we make no excuses and no apology for the fact that we are a business , " @entity58 said			0
the plaintiffs , he said , " are after one thing -- they are after money			2
" and @entity19 attorney @entity134 added , " let 's make it clear			1
my client , mr. @entity14 , is not a cult leader			2
@entity19 is not a cult			1
" but @entity140 , the lawyer who filed suit on behalf of @entity48 and 26 other former employees in may , said @entity19 leaders indoctrinate followers , then " take advantage of you and take all your money			1
" @entity48 also said @entity14 singled her out for special attention and eventually sexually assaulted her while she was living and working in @entity150 , @entity15			0
she said she trusted @entity14 and saw him as a father figure , eventually following him to @entity150 -- where , she says , he assaulted her one night in 2007 at his apartment			0
" in my mind , there was no possible way i could have physically or verbally resisted him , " @entity48 told @entity2			0
" to say no to him was to say no to his soul			0
i became numb , and so what happened , happened not at my consent			0
" @entity48 said she never filed a police report			0
the first time she publicly made the allegation was when she and other former employees filed suit in early 2009			2
@entity19 's @entity63 operations are now based near @entity165 , @entity1 , about 20 miles from @entity0 -- where @entity14 appeared in december to dedicate the 39 - foot statue of " @entity167			1
" the name is @entity15 for " @entity11 , " the mother figure in a seventh - century creation legend @entity14 cites as his inspiration			2
it was a rare appearance for @entity14 , who is seldom seen in public and routinely travels with a retinue of bodyguards			0
@entity2 requested an on - camera interview with @entity14 through his representatives , but was turned down			2
when approached at a dedication ceremony in this small @entity1 town , he was surrounded by bodyguards , one of whom said the @entity19 founder needed a translator to understand the questions			1
when a @entity2 photographer who speaks @entity15 translated , @entity14 said it was the first time he had heard of the sex assault allegation			0
then his bodyguards forced the camera lens to point toward the ground , and @entity14 continued to the ribbon - cutting			2
later , his attorney said any claims of sexual assault were not true , and " we are confident we will get those claims dismissed in court			2
" @entity48 , who goes by " @entity197 , " and college friend @entity198 also say they were strongly urged to undergo extreme physical training at @entity19 's retreat center in @entity165 -- training they say left both women at the brink of exhaustion			1
one of the exercises , known as " bow training , " involved deep knee bends to the floor to a prone position and back up again , with hands raised high over their heads			2
@entity198 , who has joined the lawsuit , says once she had to do 3,000 of the exercises -- " which took about 10 hours , and we did n't eat or drink during that time			0
" " people were screaming , people were throwing up , people were running away , " @entity198 said			0
" people were rolling around , moaning , crying , wailing -- there was a lot of emotional distress			0
we were taught that because of this bow training , we were cleaning what was blocking us , to connect to our soul			0
" @entity19 calls @entity198 's description of the exercise inaccurate			1
" these are meditation practices , " @entity58 said			0
" they are common throughout @entity230 , especially in @entity15			0
generally , people do a smaller number of bows , and they build up to more			0
i know of no one who does 3,000 bows on a regular basis			0
" and @entity19 instructor @entity238 told @entity2 , " the practices that we practice are very helpful			1
" " they empower people to really use everything they have to become the best person they can be , and i 've benefited greatly from it , " @entity238 said			0
other @entity19 employees sent @entity2 e-mails supportive of the organization and its leader while this report was being prepared			1
@entity252 praised @entity14 , with one woman saying she had given her life to him and to the organization			0
the writers all condemned their former colleagues who have gone to court , and they deny the company is a cult			1
by all accounts , @entity19 is a booming business			1
@entity14 is revered by most of its adherents			0
but some former employees who say they once loved the organization are now saying far different things			2
" the problem was way at the top , at the very , very top , things are completely dishonest , " @entity198 said			0
" and that information trickled down so that everyone is believing one thing , which is a total lie			0

former employees allege @entity19 is " a totalistic , high - demand cult group "
the company denies the allegations and calls the plaintiffs " disgruntled former employees "
