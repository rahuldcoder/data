-- how can a @entity3 777 - @entity2 passenger jet go missing for more than a day ? turns out , it 's not so easy			1
that 's not just because the state - of - the - art jetliner has a wing span of nearly 200 feet and a length of more than 209 feet			1
it 's also because it 's bristling with communications gear , including radios , automatic beacons , gps and computer communications systems , according to @entity0 aviation correspondent @entity15			1
in addition to carrying @entity18 and vhf radios , the planes -- which cost more than $ 250 million apiece -- are equipped with @entity20 and @entity22 technology			1
embedded in the plane 's computers , it tells the airline how the aircraft is performing -- speed , fuel , thrust			1
" if anything fails , it will send a signal to @entity34 , " @entity15 said			1
the deadliest commercial airline crashes though officials do not know what happened to @entity39 , whatever it may have been must have been catastrophic , he said			1
" planes do n't fall out of the sky at 36,000 feet			2
" asked to detail the communications devices aboard the missing jet , @entity3 spokesman @entity43 said , " it 's not appropriate for us to discuss that right now			1
" still , there is precedent for a modern jetliner to fall from the sky while " in the cruise " and lay hidden for months , @entity53 said			2
on june 1 , 2009 , @entity55 was en route from @entity57 to @entity59 ' @entity58 when communications ended suddenly from the @entity61 , another state - of - the - art aircraft			1
" one of the first things we had was a series of @entity68 messages that showed failure of the aircraft and degradation of the systems , " @entity15 said			2
" what we did n't know was why			2
we knew what had gone wrong ; we knew how it had gone wrong ; we did n't know why it had gone wrong			2
" it took four searches over the course of nearly two years to locate the bulk of flight 447 's wreckage and the majority of the 228 bodies in a mountain range deep under the ocean			1
it took even longer to find the cause of the disaster			2
in may 2011 , the aircraft 's voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered from the ocean floor after an extensive search using miniature submersible vehicles			1
it was not until july 2012 that investigators published their report , which blamed the crash on a series of errors by the pilots and a failure to react effectively to technical problems			0
@entity106 's @entity105 detailed how the pilots failed to respond effectively to problems with the plane 's speed sensors or to correct its trajectory when things started to go wrong			0
when ice crystals blocked the plane 's pitot tubes , which are part of a system used to determine air speed , the autopilot disconnected and the pilots did not know how to react , the report said			0
" the occurrence of the failure in the context of flight in cruise completely surprised the crew of flight af 447 , " the report said			0
the crew responded by over-handling the aircraft , which destabilized its flight path and caused further confusing readings , the report said			0
" in the first minute after the autopilot disconnection , the failure of the attempt to understand the situation and the disruption of crew cooperation had a multiplying effect , inducing total loss of cognitive control of the situation			0
" the @entity61 went into a sustained stall , signaled by a warning message and buffeting of the aircraft , the report said			0
" despite these persistent symptoms , the crew never understood they were in a stall situation and therefore never undertook any recovery maneuvers			0
" the pilots responded by pointing the nose upward , rather than downward , to recover			0
" that rewrote our understanding of what happens in massive crashes like this , " @entity15 said			0
" in 447 , you had a minor malfunction of the aircraft , and the pilot flew the airplane in a way that caused it to crash			0
" plane was ' at safest point ' in flight			0

the @entity2 is bristling with communications gear
in 2009 , @entity55 crashed into the ocean en route from @entity57 to @entity59
it took nearly two years to locate the bulk of the wreckage
