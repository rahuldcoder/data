-- @entity1 has sold loads of cheap @entity3 ever since it decided to introduce a @entity5 - only model and drop the price to just $ 139			1
now , the company is taking its low - priced - @entity9 initiative a step further by introducing on - screen ads to its lowest - price model , allowing the company to drop the price by another $ 25			1
the ad - supported @entity3 will begin shipping on may 3			1
kindle director @entity17 revealed the company 's plans in an interview with the @entity21 on monday afternoon			0
" it was very important that we did n't interfere with the reading experience , " @entity17 told the publication , noting that ads would display across the bottom of the screen and on the @entity9 's screen saver , but not while the user was reading a @entity9 book			1
" we think customers are going to love it			0
" loving the new @entity9 with @entity33 -- yes , that 's the actual product name -- might be somewhat of a stretch for many users			0
if the ads stay out of @entity9 books and remain limited to the navigation screen and screen saver , they will at least be unobtrusive , and users might be ok with that			2
@entity0 : @entity43 unlikely to explode in presence of cellphone radiation however , the device will still cost $ 114 ; the $ 25 savings may not be enough to convince some cheapskates			0
( call us when the ad - supported @entity9 costs $ 50 , and we may be more impressed			1
) so , loving it might be hard , but liking it is a remote possibility			0
on the upside , @entity1 does n't look like it 's replacing the previous ad - free version of the @entity5 - only @entity9			1
according to a new ad on the front page of its website , @entity1 offers three options : the @entity9 for $ 114 , @entity5 - only kindle for $ 139 , and the @entity60 for $ 189			2
@entity0 : @entity61 connects tablets to @entity63 the company also said it 's introducing an app called @entity66 that will allow customers to help choose future ( ad - related ) screensavers , and that users will be able to specify their screen saver preferences so they only see the images they like the most			2
these elements combined make the @entity9 with @entity33 offers a little easier to swallow , but we 're glad the option is still there to fork over an extra $ 25 for an advertising - free e-book reader			0
