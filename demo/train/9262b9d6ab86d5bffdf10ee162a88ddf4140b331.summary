-- i have n't had a single @entity2 in 2014			2
it was a conscious health decision , and the only real side effect , now , is that the world is awful and i hate everything			2
quite frankly , my life was much better when i drank @entity2			2
mind you , that purpose was to spend seven hours a day in front of a urinal			2
but some really good ideas came out of that			2
" @entity18 , we should totally build an ark. " i 've actually written before about my @entity2 addiction			2
there was even a short period where it was pretty much all i drank			2
for instance , i would come home from a jog , tired and dehydrated having just spent a whole 20 minutes mildly exerting myself , and then i 'd take long , deep pulls from a two - liter bottle , fresh and cold right out of the fridge			2
of course i miss @entity2 , and i still get the urges			0
but it usually ends after about an hour when one of the neighbors sees me crying in the street without pants and calls the cops			0
thankfully , however , all that seems to be a thing of the past , because now there 's a new virtual reality video game that lets you digitally enjoy the greatest pleasure in all the world			1
it 's called @entity47 and it 's totally real			1
the game was created by 33 - year - old @entity51 of @entity52 , @entity53 , and , like all good innovations , it was inspired by laziness			1
" i woke up in the middle of the night and needed a soda , " he told me via e-mail			1
" unfortunately , i did n't have one , so i decided to make a simulated soda			1
" amazingly , over the course of one day , @entity51 created the first five levels of @entity62 is probably why the graphics are what some experts might call complete and utter crap			0
but that 's part of the @entity47 charm			1
it 's purposefully absurd , and , remember , this thing was built in a day			0
so , the game is n't exactly @entity71			1
it 's more like @entity73			0
and the rules are pretty simple			0
you walk around different environments with a virtual soda in your hand , click left to put the straw up to your mouth , and then click right to simulate drinking			1
you hear the sound of draining fluid , and your soda levels deplete as you hold down the click			1
and that 's pretty much it			0
may the odds be ever in your favor			0
truth be told , i did n't actually play long enough to get past levels one and two ( the beach and the park , respectively ) , but i 'm sort of hoping that one of the now 100 - plus levels is a drainage ditch in @entity98 so i can recreate some of my darkest moments with @entity2			0
" @entity100 or , usted @entity101 ¡ asustando a los @entity102 os. " now , this might all sound a bit silly , and the bad graphics and simplistic game play are fine for goofing off on your @entity107 or pc , but @entity51 has actually taken his " first person soda " to the next legitimate level of gaming			1
he proudly boasts that it has @entity115 support for @entity116 , and that console will also offer exclusive levels of drinking soda throughout time			1
or , say , 1972			0
and @entity47 even has @entity123 support			1
( note to @entity124 : @entity123 is that incredible virtual reality software @entity125 bought for $ 2 billion			1
) ( note to @entity124 : @entity125 is that website mom is always on			0
) ( note to @entity124 : virtual reality is ... oh , screw it			1
) beyond the fact that it 's catching on at all -- albeit ironically -- it 's also interesting that it 's happening now			0
@entity51 created the game six years ago , but it took a rather captive audience to get it off the ground			1
he explains , " i did n't show anyone except some friends , but last year i did a presentation of @entity47 at a soda drinking convention in @entity141			1
" you read that correctly			0
there 's literally something called the @entity146 , and apparently they hold a convention			2
which , i suppose , should n't be that unexpected			0
it 's not even an island			0
it 's more like @entity73			0
follow @ @entity155 on @entity156 .			0

@entity47 is a virtual reality game that simulates enjoying a soft drink
it started getting noticed after it was shown at a soda drinking convention in @entity141
the game is now ready for @entity116 and @entity123
