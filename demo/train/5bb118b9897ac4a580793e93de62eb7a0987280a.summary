@entity0 -- @entity3 sports columnist @entity2 will not face prosecution over child sex abuse allegations -- even if there were grounds for charges -- because the statute of limitations concerning the alleged crimes has expired , according to prosecutors			1
the claims were published in an article by the @entity15 on tuesday after an investigation was initiated by authorities , according to a statement from @entity19 , a spokesman for the @entity20 in @entity21			0
the article says three women and a man allege they were molested by @entity25 in the 1970s when they were between the ages of 7 and 12			1
one of the alleged victims is @entity2 's niece , said @entity29 , an attorney who represents three of the accusers			1
a spokesman for the @entity3 said the newspaper had no knowledge of the allegations prior to @entity36 's story			1
@entity2 has denied the claims , speaking through his attorney			1
he retired from the @entity3 on tuesday , the newspaper said			1
" mr. @entity2 is obviously floored by these allegations , which supposedly happened 40 years ago			1
he 's engaged me to do everything possible to bring the facts forward to vindicate his name , " said attorney @entity41			0
prosecutors say an exhaustive investigation had been launched into the allegations			0
but , @entity19 said , it was later determined that even if there were legal grounds to pursue a criminal prosecution , prosecutors are barred from doing so because the alleged crimes occurred too long ago			2
a 1996 law actually eliminates statutes of limitations on sexual assault cases in @entity21 , but the law is not considered retroactive for claims that date back as far as the 1970s			2
still , @entity29 said , his clients want to speak out			0
" they made the decision that they were going to tell their story , " the attorney told @entity1			0
" this is n't a he - said , she - said story			0
it 's a he - said , they - said			0
their only motives are getting closure and public service			0
" @entity29 also noted , after speaking with his clients , that the accusations made in @entity36 's story were accurate			0
@entity2 , 77 , who gained national recognition from appearances on @entity81 , could not be immediately reached for comment			1
the veteran sportswriter worked for the @entity3 for nearly half a century			2
the newspaper published an editorial wednesday written by its managing editor in an effort to address the scandal			0
" i have been a journalist for more than a quarter century , and i have never had a professional experience that was sadder â € ” or more shocking â € ” than reading the allegations leveled against @entity2 yesterday , " wrote @entity89			2
" we 've taken the unusual step of also running ( the @entity36 's story ) , in its entirety , on the following page , because i felt you deserved to see the allegations in full context , " he added			0
still , @entity89 reminded readers that @entity2 has not been charged with a crime			2
the @entity36 and the @entity3 are owned by a parent company , @entity102			2
this week 's allegations come in the wake of a series of recent child sex abuse scandals , including the case against former @entity109 assistant football coach @entity108 , who faces more than 50 counts of child sex abuse spread over several years			1
@entity2 , who covered sports throughout @entity113 for the newspaper , weighed in on the @entity109 scandal last month in a column published by the @entity3 titled " tough guys are talking about @entity108			1
" @entity2 expressed doubt about those who said they would have intervened on behalf of a child , had they witnessed the boy 's alleged molestation at the hands of @entity108 in a university locker room shower			1
" everybody says he will do the right thing , get involved , put his own ass on the line before or after the fact , " @entity2 wrote in a column published on november 11			1
" but the moment itself has a cruel way of suspending our fearless intentions			0
