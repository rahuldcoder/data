-- i 'm obviously not the only one disappointed in @entity2			1
i thought he would be another @entity4 in at least one respect : he 'd be a great communicator			0
listening to his speeches in 2008 , i thought that this man could connect			2
he had energy and vision , hope and strength			2
so what happened ? somewhere along the way , disturbingly early in his first term , he fizzled as a communicator			0
it 's not that he did n't do good things			1
he brought the @entity20 economy back from the brink of another @entity22 , and ( by comparison with our counterparts in @entity26 ) we are doing extremely well			1
jobs are back , with unemployment steadily falling , and the stock market has soared , thus underpinning the retirement hopes of millions who rely on equity portfolios to sustain them in their old age			1
we have discontinued pursuing " wars of choice , " although it may take generations to recover from the mistake of invading @entity39 , which will cost the @entity20 taxpayers two trillion bucks -- with health care for veterans taxing our children and grandchildren for years to come			1
@entity2 withdrew somewhat precipitously from @entity39 , putting too much faith in the @entity51 - led government in @entity52 and giving @entity53 an opening			1
he may have done this in part out of frustration over the @entity51 - led government 's inability to provide legal protections for @entity20 troops that would have remained			2
but in truth , he handled the situation pretty well in the end , as @entity53 is sputtering out , slowly but surely			0
indeed , @entity53 was always a ragtag ( if singularly vicious ) group surrounded by natural and powerful enemies , including @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , and @entity71 in @entity72			0
they were a flash in the pan , though a painful one			0
as for @entity76 , this seems now under broad control , with the number of cases declining			0
@entity76 was always a greatly exaggerated fear , though obviously a cause for concern that requires vigilance			0
but this was the @entity53 and @entity76 election , with panic at high levels on both fronts around the country			0
and it was widely perceived that @entity2 was not reacting in a strong way to these threats , even though -- in my view -- he was actually doing quite a lot on both fronts behind the scenes			1
his mantra has famously been " do n't do stupid stuff , " and this has largely been a good and rare thing , even if critics pounce on this as a sign of his being a wimp			2
@entity104 was no wimp , but look where that got us ! he made the worst foreign policy decision in recent history when he invaded @entity39 , setting in motion waves of instability that it will take a generation to quell and subsidize			1
health care has , of course , been the main focus of " hope and change " for @entity2 , and yet he was also defeated in this midterm election by @entity121 ; denouncing it became a mantra for his political enemies			1
yet apart from its initial rollout problems , @entity121 has been a measured success , allowing large numbers of previously uninsured @entity20 to have access to health care			1
the rollout problem was not just the result of too much interest in the program , though there certainly was that			0
it was a flawed website that could n't handle the demand , and it was a management failure not to have sufficiently tested the system before it went online			2
but the state - run insurance exchanges have largely been a success : even @entity140 has been forced to support the way the exchange has worked in @entity143 , although he does n't support the benefits of this program for people in other states ! one would have thought the considerable positive effects of @entity121 , including the widely reported reduction in health care costs , would have helped @entity152			1
but that did n't happen			2
let 's face it , @entity2 did a lousy job of making the success of his health care program understandable to the wider public			1
he also did a lousy job of consulting with @entity161 about this program before it was passed , and he seems curiously disinterested in actually talking with the @entity20 people about his successes , although he will occasionally give a speech and , in what seems like a bored way , recite his accomplishments			0
the problem is , i suspect , that he does n't believe in himself			2
he is n't willing to buy his own story			2
there must be many reasons for this			0
@entity177 , in a good article in @entity176 last summer , notes that , in fact , @entity2 has never felt confident in separating from the macho rhetoric of @entity104			1
he has spoken repeatedly about @entity181 's right to act on its own in the world , saying ( for instance ) in one speech at @entity185 : " i believe in @entity20 exceptionalism with every fiber of my being			1
" what he offers is , according to @entity177 , a " watered down neoconservertive global agenda " -- but does n't really seem to believe what he 's saying , as he walks every assertion like one this back in due course			1
it 's clear enough from his actions in @entity39 and @entity195 that he actually wants the @entity20 to exert less , not more , military presence abroad , and to work with coalitions and within the confines of international law , like any other civilized nation			2
we are not the only country in the world , however much we like to imagine we are			0
it 's crucial that we work in partnership with other countries			0
what better time to do this than now , when much of the industrialized world seems very much anti-authoritarian and democratic ? we should consider @entity26 and @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , and most countries in @entity181 our natural allies in the movement toward a peaceable world , where economic stability and human rights are respected			0
i will dare to hope that , in the waning years of his presidency , @entity2 might actually begin to communicate with the @entity20 people about his real dreams for a better world			1
not doing stupid stuff is fine			0
but it 's not everything			0
and he knows that already .			0

@entity230 : many impressed by @entity2 in 2008 let down . what changed about him ?
he 's done much : brought down unemployment , saved economy , brought health care *reform*
but he does n't communicate this . why ? perhaps he does n't believe in himself , he says
@entity230 : especially on foreign policy , my hope is he *'ll* better spell out his hopes for the world
