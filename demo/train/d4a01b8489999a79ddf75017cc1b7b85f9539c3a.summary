-- is it just me or is the @entity4 plan to corral online porn going terribly wrong ? we already have reports that universities are snapping up @entity9 in an effort to get ahead of porn pranksters who want to besmirch a few good online names with smut			1
i guess this turn of events was obvious to anyone with half a brain			2
legitimate porn sites have little interest in the triple x domains , which went on sale earlier this week , for their businesses because they see them as potential censorship and , more importantly , they thrive on people accidentally stumbling on their urls			1
in the early days of the web this was common because porn purveyors snapped up known names and brands -- none of which had to feature an obvious porn domain label			1
that 's how " @entity38 " ended up , for a time , as a porn site			2
. @entity39 was designed to improve the situation			2
no more accidentally typing in , well , something you did n't intend			0
with a designated porn domain , it 's unlikely anyone would end up in the wrong place			2
better yet , corporations and homes could easily block all			1
that 's the plan , but if pornographers stay away and legitimate people , companies , businesses and universities race to snap up any and all @entity39 domain names that could be construed as theirs , then this triple xxx domain could be an embarrassing failure for the @entity4 ( @entity4 )			1
think i 'm exaggerating ? the @entity63 reports that 80,000 xxx domains were sold in presale and many companies like @entity67 and @entity68 lined up to purchase adult domains			1
the @entity70 reportedly just paid $ 3,000 for a variety of @entity72			2
it 's unlikely anyone will ever type in @entity75 , but that 's not the point			0
the university just wanted to be safe			0
even as i 'm writing this , i 'm wondering if @entity81 , too , should try to protect my good name by buying the @entity84 domain			2
i know where to go			0
@entity86 is registering them for $ 99 a year , making these domains considerably more expensive than standard domains ( which you can buy at various sites at anywhere from $ 1.99 or $ 9.99 -- yearly maintenance fees are then more expensive )			1
according to the website , if i wanted to launch an adult website under that url , i actually have to become an " internet community member " and then confirm my status of " the sponsored adult entertainment community "			0
my guess is that this is how the @entity4 polices the @entity72 , to ensure that someone is n't registering someone else 's brand as a porn site			1
i have no plans to do so , which conveniently means i do not have to become a part of the " community			0
" @entity86 tells me this too , and is -- fortunately , i guess -- only too happy to help me park my url for the same exorbitant fee			1
atop @entity86 's xxx domain registration page is this : " let 's be adult about it			1
create an adult web presence or protect your brand			0
" this is followed by an explanation of why you 'd want to register an xxx domain			2
note what it starts with : " secure your brand			0
" " perhaps you 'd like to create an adult entertainment website			0
or maybe you 're here to keep your brand from being registered as a			0
whatever your reasons for wanting a			0
@entity39 domain , you 've come to the right place			0
to check the availability of your domain , type the name you want into the search box above			0
" @entity86 has built its brand with coy references to sex ( check out any of its @entity136 ads ) , but it 's not being coy here			1
the message is clear : if you do n't want someone launching a porn xxx domain with your name or brand , you 'd better let @entity86 take your money and register it for you			1
while i see the parallels with the early days of the web , this situation is different in one fundamental way : those snapping up the domains for protection will never use them			2
no one outside the porn industry wants to run a live xxx domain website			1
these businesses and universities are simply buying them in what @entity86 actually calls " @entity162 " to hide them from view forever ( and they 'll pay @entity86 yearly fees to do so )			1
instead of creating a solution , the @entity4 's apparently misguided efforts have spawned a new anxiety : " @entity167 in @entity168			0
" the fear is so strong that it 's got all these people buying up domains just so the wrong people ca n't get them			1
as i see it , this could be quite a windfall for @entity86			1
the company should send the @entity4 a thank - you note			0
