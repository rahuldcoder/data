@entity0 , @entity1 -- the second son of former @entity1 leader @entity4 appeared via a video link sunday at his trial at a court in @entity0 , where he and dozens of former senior regime officials face charges for crimes they are accused of committing during the 2011 revolution			1
@entity13 , once his father 's heir apparent , has been held in the western mountain city of @entity17 by the militiamen who captured him in 2011			1
the group has refused to hand him over to the central government , citing security concerns and lawlessness in the capital			0
the trial was held under tight security with roads leading to @entity0 's @entity28 blocked off by security forces and gunmen positioned on the building 's rooftop			2
the judge read the charges against the defendants , which included the killing of protesters -- a crime punishable by a death sentence -- and other alleged crimes to try and suppress the 2011 uprising			1
among the 23 defendants present at the hearing were @entity45 , the elder @entity4 's brother - in - law and former spy chief , former prime minister @entity47 and the regime 's head of foreign intelligence , @entity51			1
eight other defendants held in the city of @entity54 also appeared via video link at the trial			0
after more than two years in prison , @entity45 , who was extradited from @entity57 , appeared frail and had lost weight			0
@entity4 seemed relaxed and frequently smiled during the two - hour proceeding			2
in response to the judge 's question on whether he had a lawyer , @entity4 responded twice , saying , " i have @entity65 "			2
he later said he did not have a lawyer , and the court ordered one to be appointed for him			0
the @entity68 in the @entity69 indicted @entity4 and @entity45 on war crimes , but @entity1 refused to hand them over , arguing they had to face justice in their own country			1
although the international court granted @entity1 the right to try @entity45 last year , his @entity68 - appointed lawyer was appealing the ruling			2
some defendants complained about not having enough access to their lawyers , and @entity45 asked the court to allow foreign lawyers to represent him because @entity1 lawyers , he said , were not able to do so			0
rights groups have raised concerns about @entity1 's ability to provide the defendants with a fair trial			1
" the case of 30 + former @entity4 officials has been problematic from a procedural point of view from the onset as some defendants , including @entity13 and @entity45 , both held in isolation in different locations , still do not have access to a lawyer and were not able to review court documents , " said @entity90 , a @entity1 researcher for @entity91			1
" in cases involving the death penalty , it is more important than ever to adhere to fair trial standards			1
" there have also been concerns about the use of the video link in this trial			0
" every defendant should have the right to communicate and consult without delay and in full confidentiality with their lawyers before and during a trial			0
the current arrangements in which some defendants are physically separated from the court and their lawyers cast doubt over respect for these rights and some defendants risk being mere spectators in their own trial , " said @entity119 , who was observing sunday 's proceedings in @entity0			0
the judge adjourned the trial to may 11 .			0
