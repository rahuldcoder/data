adm. @entity13 , chairman of the @entity14 , accompanied @entity15 for what one senior @entity17 official said beforehand would be a " sober " set of talks about the need for @entity1 to root out terrorists in its country			1
the meeting between @entity15 and president @entity25 was behind closed doors , but afterward @entity15 described it as " very extensive , open , frank and constructive			2
" describing the countries as friends with shared interests , @entity15 said the @entity11 and @entity1 must intensify the fight against terrorists who have used @entity1 as a safe haven			1

" i want to underscore a point that i made in public in the last weeks and made again privately today to the president , the prime minister and others , " the secretary said in a joint statement with @entity13			2
" there is absolutely no evidence that anyone at the highest levels of the @entity1 government knew that ( @entity12 ) was living just miles from where we are today			0
" the revelation that @entity12 was living in plain sight for years amongst @entity1 military installations , and @entity1 's humiliation at the @entity11 decision to undertake the raid without telling them , has thrown the relationship into one of its worst points in history			1
" now is not the time for retreat or for recrimination , " @entity13 told reporters			0
" now is the time for action and closer coordination ; for more cooperation , not less ; for the friendship to get stronger , not weaker			0
" @entity15 said @entity1 has a responsibility to prevent insurgents from waging war in @entity74 from its territory			1

" both @entity15 and @entity13 noted that @entity1 blood has been shed in terror attacks			1

a senior @entity96 administration official told reporters after the meeting that it provided an opportunity for the leaders to smooth the relationship			0
" i think we walked back from the brink from a week or two , i think this continued the process and i do n't think she would have come if they had n't already taken some of those initial steps			0
i think this is simply defining and putting that on firmer and firmer grounding , " the official said			0
that official and a second senior administration official hinted that joint @entity11 - @entity1 operations may be conducted soon			1
acording to a @entity2 / @entity118 , about 80 % of @entity11 have an unfavorable opinion of @entity1 and about 25 % consider the country to be an enemy of the @entity11			1

@entity15 had been expected to visit @entity1 earlier this month for more fulsome talks , as part of a " strategic dialogue " that covers more than a dozen areas of cooperation between @entity134 and @entity0			2
but she postponed her visit after the raid on @entity12 's compound by @entity139			0
" the fact of the matter is that the international community has been able to kill more terrorists on @entity1 soil than any place else in the world			0
we could not have done that without @entity1 cooperation , " @entity15 told reporters in @entity148 earlier this week			2
" i believe strongly it is in our national security interests to have a comprehensive , long - term partnership with the government and people of @entity1			1
" last week , @entity157 , special envoy for @entity74 and @entity1 , traveled to @entity0 , where he delivered the set of demands , emphasizing the @entity11 needed actions , not words from @entity1 , according to a senior official briefed on the talks			1
the official was not authorized to speak on the record			0
during several meetings with @entity25 , and others , @entity157 said the @entity11 was looking for more cooperation from @entity1 in fighting extremism			2
the meetings were described by a senior official briefed on the talks as " tough , but fruitful			0
" the talks followed a visit a few days earlier by sen. @entity175 , chairman of the @entity176 , who delivered a similarly tough message during the meetings with @entity157 , the senior @entity11 official said , a @entity1 official voiced strong concern about the continuation of @entity11 drone strikes against targets inside @entity1 , but he and other members of the @entity1 leadership expressed a willingness to press @entity188 , conduct joint operations and support reconciliation			1
officials point to enough progress since @entity157 's visit , including the fact @entity1 returned the tail of a helicopter that was left behind after the raid , for @entity15 to make the trip to @entity1			1
but they say the relationship between the two countries needs serious repair before cooperation on areas important to @entity1 can continue			2
two weeks ago , the @entity1 asked the @entity11 to reduce the number of military trainers in @entity1			2
a @entity207 spokesman said this week the @entity11 has begun to comply and is removing some of the more than 200 personnel who are posted there .			0
