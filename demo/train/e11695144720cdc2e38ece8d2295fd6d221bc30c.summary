it has all the makings of a @entity3 blockbuster : a beautiful leading lady , an ukulele - toting hero and more than three hours of dancing across locations in @entity9 , @entity10 and the @entity11			2
" @entity16 , " which is also known as @entity16 and translates as " @entity17 will take away @entity18 , " has been on the big screen for an unprecedented 1,009 weeks -- nearly 20 years -- at @entity15 's @entity14 theater			1
the longest - running film in @entity9 movie history , the 189 - minute romantic comedy is about a young @entity9 couple from @entity10 who meet during a road trip around @entity24			1
@entity25 , who is from a strict , conservative family , is due to be married off to a husband in @entity9 , when a @entity28 , a young hot head , pursues her			0
after much singing , dancing and serenading across fields of poppies , they fall head over heels in love -- despite opposition from their families			0
much of @entity16 's enduring success is down to the movie 's young leading actress , @entity42 , who plays @entity25			2
a virtual unknown when the film released in 1995 , she 's now @entity3 royalty -- known as much for her very distinctive eyebrows as her singing and dancing			1
then there 's @entity42 's co-star @entity52 , who plays as @entity28			0
now one of the most famous men in the world , he played a cheesy , over-the - top kid with a fancy car and charming dimples			0
barely a blip on the @entity3 radar back then , @entity52 's career was defined by the first notes from his character 's ukulele , which wafted through a field of yellow flowers as @entity42 -- wearing hot pink lipstick -- ran towards him with the urgency of a woman in love			0
' spontaneous outcry ' so when the @entity14 theater decided to end the @entity76 production 's two - decade run on its big screen , it caused an uproar among many @entity15 residents			1
@entity28 put out a statement on its website titled " @entity82 ! " on february 19			1
the production company and the movie theater explained to the public that it had been " mutually decided to end the film 's historic and record breaking run			1
" the announcement triggered what @entity89 described as " a spontaneous and an overwhelming outcry from the cinema going audience			0
" the @entity14 theater told @entity0 by phone that it had " received hundreds upon hundreds of calls " the day the end of the film 's historic run was announced			1
fans also took to the movie 's official website posting messages like : " @entity16 -- @entity103 will no more be running in @entity104 ! ! ! i really had a wish to go and fall in love once there ... a part of my dream dies today ! ! " another said , " ouch ! this was not expected			1
some legends are too good to come to an end ... at least not without a warning ! @entity16 -- @entity103 comes to a halt ! " so -- after only two days -- the decision was reversed and @entity28 invited movie lovers to " come fall in love ... again and again , " as the movie 's tag line goes			2
' absolute nostalgia ' the scale of the @entity3 film industry -- the word 's most prolific -- is truly staggering : the government estimates the industry produces more than 1,200 feature films a year , while approximately 15 million @entity9 fill cinemas daily			2
at this point , there are not even enough cinemas to screen these films			0
even @entity136 president @entity135 quoted , or tried to quote , a famous line from @entity16 during his visit to @entity9 last month , while discussing the economy and aid packages with prime minister @entity141			2
" @entity142 , bade bade deshon mein ... " he started to say , before trailing off with : " you know what i mean			0
" last year when the film marked 1,000 weeks on screen , @entity52 paid homage to his character by tweeting a picture of himself carrying his backpack from the movie with the caption : " tried my 20 yrs later @entity28 look			0
the bag and me is original from the film ...			0
the smile is from today for a 1000 weeks ! " @entity42 , meanwhile , in november tweeted stills from the movie with an emphatic : " re-living # @entity16 ! absolute nostalgia ! ! ! " the movie 's return to the big screen means that now -- at 11.30 a.m. every day - @entity15 's film aficionados can share that nostalgia , once again falling under the spell of some truly classic crooning @entity3 - style .			1

" @entity16 " released in 1995 and is @entity9 's longest running film
@entity15 's @entity14 theater announced february 19 that the film 's run would end
hundreds of fans expressed outrage and the romantic comedy has been brought back
