we could use a new you			0
a superhorse to make our hearts pound the way your hooves did			0
a four - legged stud to give us a break from cheating golfers , dog - torturing football quarterbacks and doped - up bike racers and baseball sluggers			0
@entity15 day is upon us again			1
it has been 40 years since you , @entity16 -- hey , no one who knew you called you @entity1 -- took the @entity15 , then the @entity19 , then the @entity20 ( by a ludicrous 31 lengths ) for what we like to call horse racing 's @entity23			1
incredibly , in all three races -- i repeat , all three -- @entity1 still owns the fastest time			1
after he died in 1989 , they discovered @entity16 's heart to be more than twice the normal size			1
this handsome chestnut was half colt , half @entity33 ... a mean , russet running machine			0
@entity1 's historic @entity20 race a horse is a horse ? of course , of course , yet not a one has won a @entity23 since 1978 , when @entity40 did it			1
and no steed in lo these 40 years has had anything close to @entity1 's popularity , pizzazz and -- ok , i got ta do it -- animal magnetism			1
saturday afternoon , it 's time for yet another wild @entity51 roundup			1
an equine chorus line of toddler - seeking - tiara 3 - year - olds will be saddled up in @entity54 for the 139th running of the @entity15 , a horse race so old , the first one was run 10 years after the @entity59 - bred @entity58 got assassinated			1
verrazano ? @entity62 ? @entity63 ? oxbow ? overanalyze ? @entity64 , maybe ? they 'll be at the post , barring late scratches , with quite a few others for the @entity15 , so it 's definitely going to be somebody 's lucky day			1
is there a secretariat in the bunch ? a magnificent nag who will make tongues wag in the months ahead ? a horse that can give the sport of thoroughbred racing a badly needed golden goose ? a way to change the sports - fan conversation from the usual @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 blah blah blah ? i sure do hope so			1
but do n't hold your breath			0
@entity92 : @entity15 coverage consider the track record of the @entity15 's past nine winners : i 'll have another ( 2012 ) , @entity96 , scratched from @entity20 , has not run another race			1
@entity99 ( 2011 ) , @entity96 after @entity20 , did not run again in 2011			1
@entity100 ( 2010 ) , never won again , retired in october 2010			1
@entity101 ( 2009 ) , never won again , retired in november 2010			2
@entity102 ( 2008 ) , retired in october ' 08			0
@entity103 ( 2007 ) , retired in october ' 07			0
@entity104 ( 2006 ) , @entity96 in @entity19 , never ran another race			2
@entity106 ( 2005 ) , won one more race , retired in ' 06			1
@entity108 ( 2004 ) , lost in @entity20 , never ran again			0
kings for a day , for a fortnight , for a few weeks			0
each cashed a ticket in the @entity114 lottery , but that 's about it			2
what we 're looking for is a horse that can run and keep running , let us go see him do his thing			1
( and i do n't mean pet him in a pasture after he 's put out to stud			2
) we want a horse for the ages , a winged @entity128 to become the subject of myths			2
@entity1 went to the post only a few months more after donning his @entity23 , but at least crowds did get to come out and see him race at @entity136 , at @entity137 , at @entity20 again , even in @entity138 before he was free to go sire baby secretariats			1
( @entity140 , @entity16 ! ) @entity141 did n't run in a @entity15 , but he definitely had the kind of super-popularity i mean			1
for his match race with @entity147 in 1933 , they say 40,000 came to the track while 40 million tuned in on the radio			1
now there 's an a-list star			2
we nearly had another in @entity108 a few years back			2
i was on @entity154 when his run in the 2004 @entity20 drew an astounding crowd of 120,139 , which they say to this day is the largest crowd ever to attend a @entity161 sporting event of any kind			2
but he got caught from behind that day at the wire and then hung up his horseshoes for good			0
that swift little colt could have become 10 times the size of @entity168 , and i do n't mean on a scale			0
he could have been a cover model for @entity171 , had a hundred thousand followers at any track in @entity174 and a million on @entity175			0
we were a little giddy over i 'll have another a year ago , after he won the @entity15 and @entity19 , but his humans withdrew him from the @entity20 at the last minute			1
i 'll have another never had another			0
horse racing ai n't what it used to be			2
so many great tracks of old , gone			0
@entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , so many more , open no more			0
attendance at our surviving tracks is way down , coast - to - coast			0
lines at the $ 2 windows are n't usually too long			0
on the other hand ... " people can now sit on their couch and watch -- and bet -- on races , eliminating the need to go to the track or even to a wagering facility , " said @entity195 , long one of @entity174 's top turf writers and handicappers who is now director of publicity at @entity200 's @entity199			2
" i still believe the on - track experience is special , but in this day and age of traffic and high gas prices , i understand why people do n't want to make the trek to the track			0
" @entity214 will have its usual huge throng saturday , with tv ratings to match			0
so would n't it be swell if a superhorse could ride to racing 's rescue ? " a superhorse may spark interest for awhile , " @entity195 respectfully disagreed , " but i have never agreed with those who believe a @entity23 winner is going to be some magic elixir for whatever ails racing			1
the @entity15 is a spectacle , and a lot of people who could n't care less about racing will show up just to say that they were there			1
the same goes for tv			0
i still feel a superhorse could pack ' em in at the track , from @entity240 to @entity241 , from @entity242 to @entity243 , from @entity244 to @entity245 , if we were given a chance to jump in our cars and go see the animal everybody 's talking about , the @entity250			0
two bucks on @entity63 for me , please			0

it 's been 40 years since @entity1 won the @entity23
no horse has won the @entity23 since *affirmed* in 1978
despite lack of " superhorses , " interest in @entity15 is still high
race will be run saturday
