@entity0 -- the organizers of the @entity3 have repeatedly asserted the value of the @entity5 in the shape of wider involvement in sport , a lasting legacy of sporting facilities , and increased tourism			1
but experience from previous games suggest differently			1
not one recent @entity15 host nation can point to an increase in sport participation as a result of the @entity15			1
many of the stadiums built for the @entity21 are now expensive - to - maintain wrecks			1
as for tourism , the @entity15 generally leads to a decrease in visitor spending , not an increase , as the travel industry has pointed out			1
watch how @entity29 's @entity15 dream turns sour despite all this , not one politician or sports administrator has come up with a plan for a better games , an @entity15 for all			2
this is what my book , " why the @entity15 are n't good for @entity40 , and how they can be , " uniquely sets out to do			0
let 's be clear : i love sport			2
my book is not anti-olympics , and i will be caught up in the excitement of the @entity5 once they begin			1
but i believe the games could have been organized differently			2
i am suggesting " @entity46 " representing five core principles that would draw in the direct participation of the maximum number of people			1
otherwise , for most citizens the games can only be experienced via the remote control from the sofa			2
they might as well be taking place somewhere else , saving us both the expense and the inconvenience			0
so let 's see what a @entity5 organized under an alternative vision might look like : @entity63 : a decentralized @entity15 held all across @entity64 could have created a local games for large parts of the population , instead of everything being crammed in to @entity0			1
i would ditch the idea of a host city , and replace it with a host nation			2
ring two : spectator attendance could have been boosted by making use of the many existing large stadiums , mainly soccer grounds			0
virtually none are being utilized			0
centralizing all of the events in @entity0 venues with much smaller capacities slashes the audience that can attend and results in increased ticket prices for the few , instead of lowering those prices for the many			2
purpose - built stadiums also cost the taxpayer a lot more money			2
read what changed the @entity15 forever @entity93 : significant parts of the @entity15 program could have been held outside of stadiums entirely , creating large - scale free - to - watch events			1
a multi-stage cycling @entity98 , a round - @entity64 yacht race , a canoe marathon , even open water swimming events in the country 's lakes and lochs could have been organized			1
a measure of @entity3 's chronic lack of ambition is the abandoning of the original plan for running the marathon through @entity0 , which would have provided spectator space for hundreds of thousands			0
it has been replaced with four six - mile laps around the center of the city , reducing the potential audience by 75 %			2
watch how the @entity15 legacy impacted @entity118 @entity119 : preference could have been given to @entity15 sports that are universally accessible			0
the same few countries always win the equestrian , yachting and rowing events while entire continents have never won a single medal in these sports			0
substantial investment in specialist training , beyond the means of many countries , is required to take part in these competitions			0
compare this with the breadth of countries that have won medals in boxing , football , or middle - and long - distance running			0
these are sports requiring no expensive kit or facilities , governed by simple rules , with mass appeal			0
other sports with likely high participation could be added to the @entity15 roster			0
one of my favourite candidates is the tug - of - war , which last featured at the @entity5			1
requiring not much more than a sturdy rope , it is easy to train for , the teams could be mixed , and the spectacle could be a real crowd - pleaser			0
@entity158 : the @entity15 symbol could have been used as a symbol for sporting participation rather than as a logo for corporate sponsors			0
with priorities reversed in this way , the precious @entity164 could only have been used by voluntary and community groups to promote sport on a not - for - profit basis			1
sponsors could have been forbidden any use of the @entity164			0
they need sport just as much as sport needs their millions yet the @entity15 authorities sell the @entity5 short by meekly complying with the sponsors ' ever - escalating demands			1
let 's not forget the biggest sponsor of all of @entity3 : the @entity64 taxpayer			0
i want to build a new @entity15 , to take the best of the @entity5 i first fell in love with as a child ( i still have the sticker album to prove it )			1
why , up until now , has no such alternative been even discussed ? my book seeks to redress that failure			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			1

olympics assert value of games in terms of sport , legacy of facilities and tourism boost
@entity193 argues this is not true , and proposes *improvements* to @entity5
he proposes decentralizing games around a nation and more free - to - view events
@entity46 could also be used by *charities* instead of by sponsors
