-- the killings of three people at @entity4 sites in @entity5 are a stark reminder that even as hate groups are on the decline in the @entity9 , some among them are still deadly dangerous			1
a leader of the @entity13 called monday for institutions across the country to " use this horrible tragedy as a learning experience " and tighten their own security systems so that if " @entity21 forbid , this does happen , that the least ... harm can come to their people			1
" the @entity13 warned last week that violent attacks against @entity4 targets could spike as the @entity28 holiday -- which begins monday night and lasts eight days -- coincides with @entity30 's birthday on april 20			2
woman lost her son and father " unfortunately throughout history , @entity4 have been a target around the holidays			0
we always feel it 's necessary for @entity4 organizations to try to ramp up security , " the @entity13 's @entity37 told @entity0			1
while anti-semitic incidents in the @entity9 declined last year , the number of violent incidents went up , according to an @entity13 study			1
thirty - one reported assaults in 2013 included four men in @entity46 attacking a @entity4 man wearing a yarmulke ; a group of girls throwing a bottle at a 12 - year - old girl , with one of them calling her " dirty jew " ; and an attack on a man in @entity56 by five men who yelled " @entity30 " before striking him , the @entity13 says			1
the suspect in the @entity5 shootings -- identified by police as @entity62 , who has also used the name @entity62 -- has long spoken openly about his hatred for @entity4 and called for " exterminating " them , according to the @entity66 , which tracks hate groups			1
the @entity66 once sued him " for operating an illegal paramilitary organization and using intimidation tactics against @entity71 , " the center says			0
the @entity66 tracks groups that " have beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people , typically for their immutable characteristic			1
" " after four years of spectacular growth driven by the 2008 election of president @entity81 and the nearly simultaneous collapse of the economy , the radical right in @entity9 saw its first significant decrease in 2013 , " the @entity66 says			0
the number of hate groups shrank last year for the second year in a row , down to 939 , according to the center 's calculations			1
these groups were demoralized by @entity81 's re-election , have been losing battles on issues such as same - sex marriage , and lost support when the " litany of disasters " they predicted -- such as the @entity99 invading the @entity9 -- did n't happen , the @entity66 says			2
" none of this is to suggest that the radical right in @entity9 does not remain highly dangerous , " the @entity66 warned in its report earlier this year			2
" the weakening of groups often has the effect of fostering , rather than retarding , followers ' decisions to finally act out violently			0
" " despite the decline , there are still enormous numbers of radical groups operating -- more than 2,000 of them , including hate and @entity113 organizations			2
the single most important factor that has driven the growth of the radical right over the last five years , the ongoing demographic change to a non-white majority over the course of the next three decades , is still a source of enormous angst and rage for many			0
" many of the hate groups the @entity66 cites are anti-semitic as well as racist			1
they include @entity125 , which espouse " a racist reading of the @entity127 that describes non-white people as lacking souls and @entity4 as the biological descendants of @entity131 , " and neo-nazi groups , among others			0
the @entity66 also cites the @entity134 , whose " white - and @entity4 - bashing lawyer @entity135 relinquished his post , " and was replaced by @entity138 , also " known for his anti-semitism and anti-white racism			0
" the existence of these groups does not automatically suggest threats of violence			0
but the tragedy in @entity5 " shows that one person with the mindset of that kind of hate can really damage a community in the deepest way , " @entity37 said			0
the @entity66 's criteria for designating hate groups are a source of controversy			1
in 2012 , the @entity157 lashed back at the @entity66 for designating it as a hate group			2
