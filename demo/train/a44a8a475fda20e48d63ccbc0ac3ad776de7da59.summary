-- on the track , @entity1 is known humbly as @entity3			1
the pre-school teacher is co-captain of the @entity6 in @entity7			1
as a jammer , it 's her job to get past the opposing team 's blockers to score points			1
@entity14 's size , strength and speed make her ideal for the position			1
that was n't always the case			1
when @entity14 first joined the league in september 2009 , she weighed close to 260 pounds			1
she could barely complete 25 laps on the track without feeling sick			1
since then she 's lost 100 pounds and 75 inches from her 5 - foot , 7 - inch frame			1
learn more abut @entity27 's story on @entity28 " it 's been incredible , " says @entity14 's teammate @entity29 , @entity30			1
" she went from an overweight asthmatic who was on the slower side ... to become one of the fastest skaters that we have			1
" when @entity14 and her husband , @entity39 , first moved to @entity40 14 years ago , they lived in what 's called the bush			2
it 's a term used to describe rural portions of the state where transportation and other modern conveniences are spotty at best			2
in the bush , residents rely on packaged food and whatever they can hunt			2
@entity14 had just given birth to son @entity52			2
on a diet of @entity56 noodles , spaghetti and caribou meat , she had difficulty taking off the pregnancy weight			1
over time she and @entity39 packed on more insulation against the cold			2
in 2009 , 65 % of adults in @entity7 were overweight or obese , according to the state 's @entity64 and @entity66			1
and more than three - quarters of adults did not consume the recommend five servings of fruits and vegetables each day			2
food has to be shipped to @entity7 , making fresh produce expensive , even in metropolitan areas			1
and with subarctic temperatures that often drop below zero , staying active outdoors is out of the question			2
moving to @entity40 opened up healthy opportunities for @entity14 's family			2
but it was n't until she put on her first pair of skates that she realized just how much her weight was slowing her down			2
" my teammates liked my size -- i could use my weight to move people and be in their way , " she remembers			2
" but i could n't move very fast			2
" in the fall of 2011 , @entity14 's teammates voted her co-captain of the roller derby team			1
" it just kind of hit me , " she says			2
" i needed to be a leader , and i felt like i needed to be an athletic leader			0
that was kind of the turning point			0
" @entity14 talked to her husband and the pair did a complete overhaul of their diet			1
they reduced the amount of sugar they were eating , swapped white bread for whole grain and started planning high - protein meals with lots of vegetables			0
they cut out fast food and added daily exercise to their routine			1
on the new plan , @entity14 's husband and son also lost weight			0
@entity39 has now dropped more than 90 pounds			1
they 've also supported @entity14 in her journey on the track , adopting derby nicknames : @entity39 as bench coach " @entity127 " and 14 - year - old @entity52 as " @entity128			1
" @entity14 has gone from a size 22 to a size 8			0
she can now skate 100 laps with no problem and no longer feels clumsy on her feet			1
" i think she 's always had fun , " her teammate @entity135 says			0
" now she feels empowered to do whatever she puts her mind to			0
she does n't feel as limited			0
she 's faster on her feet			0
she 's more comfortable in her body			0
" she 's also inspired her team and her community			1
@entity135 ' partner has lost 50 pounds with @entity14 's help , and " she 's inspired a lot of members of our league to take care of themselves			1
" @entity14 has noticed the difference in her day job too			0
as a special needs teacher , she moves around a lot during the day -- crouching down to speak to a child then standing back up to take charge			0
" i would go home at the end of the day feeling so tired , " she says			0
" now it does n't even faze me			0
my energy level is so outstanding -- i love it ! " roller derby is kind of like football on wheels			1
the hits can be hard , but the camaraderie is stronger			0
after events the competing teams often go out together to socialize with beer and bar food			0
this could have been @entity14 's downfall			0
" [ i 'd hear ] ' why are n't you eating ? you should have this			0
it 's ok , ' " she says			0
instead of indulging , she carried around a cup of hot liquid , be it coffee , tea or chicken broth			0
for some reason , the hot beverage quelled her cravings			0
still , @entity14 credits her weight loss to the supportive roller derby community			1
she says she loves meeting new women whom she otherwise would n't know			0
being a skater brings out the best in people , she says , whether it 's a competitive spirit or a slimmer self			0
