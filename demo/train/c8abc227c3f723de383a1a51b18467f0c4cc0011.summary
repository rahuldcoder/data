-- an official in @entity2 is disputing an @entity4 report that parts of the region are under martial law			2
" we did not enforce martial law			2
everything is normal , " said @entity10 , an official with the information department of @entity13 prefecture			0

there were no demonstrations or protests , " @entity10 said monday			0
the @entity4 report said @entity28 authorities declared martial law in some parts of the autonomous region in an apparent response to days of protests			1
the region has long been the scene of ethnic tension between @entity37 , who have lived in the area for centuries , and the @entity41 people , who arrived in larger numbers after the founding of the @entity28 in 1949			1
@entity41 people are the majority ethnic group in @entity28			1
according to the human rights organization , 2,000 @entity47 students took to the streets wednesday in @entity18 , in a show of solidarity with an ethnic @entity47 herder by the name of " @entity54 , " who was killed earlier this month when he was hit by a coal truck that was driven by ethnic @entity57			2
@entity4 reported that the drivers of the coal truck are both in custody of @entity28 authorities			1

" the protests are a wake - up call for the authorities			0
as in other minority areas , authorities must start heeding the message rather than attacking the messengers , " said @entity93 , @entity4 's @entity94 deputy director			0
protesters say their culture is under threat as pastoral herders are pushed out from the grasslands and forced to move to the cities , or to places where animal grazing is not possible , according to @entity107 , director of the @entity75			0
