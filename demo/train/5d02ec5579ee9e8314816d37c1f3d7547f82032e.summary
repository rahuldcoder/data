the @entity2 - @entity1 peace talks beginning in @entity3 proceed within a framework of assumptions that merit careful thought			1
one prevailing assumption is that there are two options : either a two - state settlement will be reached , or there will be a " shift to a nearly inevitable outcome of the one remaining reality -- a state ' from the sea to the river ' , " an outcome posing " an immediate existential threat of the erasure of the identity of @entity2 as a @entity23 and democratic state " because of what is termed " the demographic problem , " a future @entity1 majority in the single state			1
this particular formulation is by former @entity2 @entity29 ( @entity29 ) chief @entity30 , but the basic assumptions are near universal in political commentary and scholarship			2
they are , however , crucially incomplete			0
there is a third option , the most realistic one : @entity2 will carry forward its current policies with full @entity41 economic , military , and diplomatic support , sprinkled with some mild phrases of disapproval			1
the policies are quite clear			0
their roots go back to the 1967 war and they have been pursued with particular dedication since the @entity49 of september 1993			0
the @entity50 determined that @entity51 and the @entity52 are an indivisible territorial entity			0
@entity2 and the @entity41 moved at once to separate them , which means that any autonomy @entity1 might gain in the @entity52 will have no direct access to the outside world			1
a second step was to carry forward the creation of a vastly expanded @entity3 , incorporating it within @entity2 , as its capital			2
this is in direct violation of @entity65 orders and is a serious blow to any hope for a viable @entity1 entity			2
a corridor to the east of the new @entity3 incorporates the settler town of @entity72 , established in the 1970s but built primarily after the @entity49 , virtually bisecting the @entity52			0
corridors to the north including other settler towns divide what is to remain under some degree of @entity1 control -- " bantustans , " as they were called by one of the main architects of the policy , @entity79 , in a reference to the territory set aside for black @entity84 during the apartheid era			1
meanwhile @entity2 is incorporating the territory on the @entity2 side of the " separation wall " cutting through the @entity52 , taking arable land and water resources and @entity1 villages			1
included are the settlement blocs that " will remain part of @entity2 in any possible future peace agreement , " as stated by @entity2 government spokesman @entity96 as the current negotiations were announced			2
the @entity98 ruled that all of this is illegal , and the @entity65 had already ruled that all of the settlements are illegal			0
the @entity41 joined the world in accepting that conclusion in the early years of the occupation			2
but under @entity107 , the position was changed to " harmful to peace , " and @entity109 has weakened it further to " not helpful to peace			0
" @entity2 has also been clearing the @entity111 of @entity1 while establishing @entity23 settlements , sinking wells , and otherwise preparing for eventual integration of the region within @entity2			1
that will complete the isolation of any @entity52 @entity1 entity			0
meanwhile huge infrastructure projects throughout the @entity52 , from which @entity1 are barred , carry forward the integration to @entity2 , and presumably eventual annexation			1
the areas that @entity2 is taking over will be virtually free of @entity123			0
there will be no new " demographic problem " or civil rights or anti-apartheid struggle , contrary to what many advocates of @entity1 rights anticipate in a single state			2
notably , @entity136 , @entity41 presidents have prevented @entity2 from building settlements on the @entity139 site -- a controversial area in the @entity52 that @entity2 hopes to develop -- which would complete the separation of @entity3 from @entity1 - controlled area			1
what will happen here is uncertain			0
as the negotiations opened , @entity2 made its intentions clear by announcing new construction in @entity148 and scattered settlements , while also extending its " national priority list " of settlements that receive special subsidies to encourage building and inducements for @entity23 settlers			0
@entity109 made his intentions clear by appointing as chief negotiator @entity157 , whose background is in the @entity2 lobby , a close associate of negotiator and presidential adviser @entity160 , whose guiding principle has been that @entity2 has " needs , " which plainly overcome mere @entity1 wants			1
these developments bring to the fore a second common assumption : that @entity1 have been hindering the peace process by imposing preconditions			0
in reality , the @entity41 and @entity2 impose crucial preconditions			1
one is that the process must be in the hands of the @entity41 , which is an active participant in the conflict on @entity2 's side , not an " honest broker			1
" a second is that the illegal @entity2 settlement activities must be allowed to continue			2
there is an overwhelming international consensus in support of a two - state settlement on the internationally recognized border , perhaps with " minor and mutual adjustments " of this 1949 cease - fire line , in the wording of much earlier @entity41 policy			1
the consensus includes the @entity123 states and the @entity190 ( including @entity191 )			0
it has been blocked by the @entity41 and @entity2 since 1976 , when the @entity41 vetoed a resolution to this effect brought by @entity195 , @entity111 , and @entity196			2
the rejectionist record continues to the present			0
@entity200 's most recent veto of a @entity65 resolution on @entity1 territory was in february 2011 , a resolution calling for implementation of official @entity41 policy -- an end to expansion of @entity2 's illegal settlements			1
and the rejectionist record goes far beyond the @entity65			0
also misleading is the question whether the hawkish @entity2 prime minister @entity210 would accept a " @entity1 state			1
" in fact , his administration was the first to countenance this possibility when it came into office in 1996 , following @entity216 and @entity217 , who rejected this outcome			0
@entity210 's associate @entity219 explained that some areas would be left to @entity1 , and if they wanted to call them " a state , " @entity2 would not object -- or they could call them " fried chicken			1
" his response reflects the operative attitude of the @entity41 - @entity2 coalition to @entity1 rights			1
in the region , there is great skepticism about @entity200 's current revival of the " peace process			0
" it is not hard to see why .			0

@entity236 : @entity2 will continue its current policies with @entity41 support
@entity236 : since 1993 @entity2 has sped up plan to divide , isolate @entity1 territory
@entity210 associate : some land will be left to @entity1 if they want to call it a state
