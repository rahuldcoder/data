-- in 2001 , the nation watched as @entity2 , by all accounts a loving mother , was arrested in the killings of her five children after drowning them in a bathtub			1
in the trial that followed , we learned she had a history of mental illness , which intensified in her postpartum periods and required four psychiatric hospitalizations			1
she would ultimately be found not guilty by reason of insanity and sent to a @entity20 psychiatric hospital			2
her case riveted a bewildered nation for much the same reasons as the story this past weekend of @entity25 , a woman in @entity26 who authorities say admitted to strangling or suffocating at least six of her babies , likely over a 10 - year period beginning in 1996 , and putting their bodies in boxes in her garage			1
as with @entity2 , intense national publicity has focused on the shock or horror of filicide -- the act of a parent killing a child			1
we wonder : what would cause a mother or father to do such a seemingly unnatural thing ? indeed , it 's rare enough to stop us in our tracks			2
but the practice has existed since ancient times , and the reasons may include displeasure over the child 's gender , or a disability or questionable paternity as a lack of parental resources to care for the child			1
@entity61 has been documented in literature from all eras			2
perhaps the most famous tale comes from @entity66 mythology --- the story of @entity68 , a woman who kills her sons to punish her husband for his affair			0
today , roughly two - thirds of all children murdered in the @entity75 under the age of 5 between 1980 and 2008 were killed by a parent , more specifically 33 % were killed by their fathers and 30 % by their mothers			1
we can not know what was behind the deaths of @entity84 's infants , but research may offer at least broad motivations			0
forensic psychiatrist @entity87 , a pioneer in the field of filicide research , published a seminal article in 1969 identifying five major reasons for filicide based on the motive of the perpetrator : 1			2
altruism : the parent kills the child because he or she may perceive it to be in the child 's best interest			0
it may be reality - based ( e.g. , the child suffers from a terminal illness ) or precede the suicide of the parent , as the parent feels it would be unfair to leave the child behind to face the cruel world			0
acute psychosis : the parent kills the child based on ideas that are inconsistent with reality ; for example , the parent believes the child has been possessed by the devil			1
unwanted child : the parent kills the child that he or she regards as a hindrance			0
accidental : the child 's death is an unintentional outcome of parental physical abuse			0
spousal revenge : the parent kills the child in an effort to exact revenge on the other parent			1
@entity61 is the broad term used to refer to a parent ( or a person acting in a parental role , such as a stepparent or guardian ) who kills his or her child under the age of 18 ; infanticide is the term used to define the murder of a child in the first year of life , and -- more specifically -- neonaticide refers to a parent who kills a child within the first 24 hours of life			0
@entity153 , as described by @entity87 , are most often perpetrated by young , unmarried women who do not suffer from a major mental illness and do not want their children			1
in 1997 , for example , @entity158 teen @entity157 made national news when it was discovered she gave birth in a bathroom stall at her prom and disposed of the newborn in a trash can			0
it is also worth noting there are differences between fathers and mothers who commit filicide			2
fathers are more likely to kill more than one victim , including other children and spouses			1
they are also more likely to kill themselves following the filicide			2
and fathers are often more harshly punished than women who commit similar crimes			0
@entity183 , for example , passed the @entity184 of 1922 and 1938 , which banned the use of the death penalty for mothers who killed their children in the first 12 months of life			1
these were efforts to recognize the effect that the birth and care of an infant may have on the mother			0
several other @entity196 countries have followed suit ( with the exception of the @entity75 )			0
no such laws exist to protect men charged with infanticide			0
is it possible to prevent the killing of children by their parents ? this is trickier			1
efforts to head off deaths have included the passage of safe haven laws , which allow parents to surrender infants anonymously to state custody without fear of legal repercussions			0
but parents who kill their children are a varied population , and this , unfortunately , leaves few means to identify those at risk in the first place			1
the friends and family of parents or parents - to - be suffering from stress or mental illness would best serve their loved ones by helping them get the attention of mental health providers			2
these treatment providers should in turn make every extra effort to learn specifically about the parents ' feelings toward -- or plans for -- their children			1
then , perhaps , we can have some hope of preventing these senseless tragedies .			0
