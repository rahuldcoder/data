even as unemployment rates remain persistently high , it 's expected that in the @entity28 only 20 % of workers will have the skills needed for 60 % of the jobs in the coming years			1

career customization is about enabling workers , not simply entitling them			2
employees and employers share the responsibility and the opportunity of openly discussing choices and trade - offs -- for the individual and the firm			0
