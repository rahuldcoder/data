-- on the holiday that celebrates the rev. @entity3 , many will remember his sacrifices for the civil rights movement , and serve others in his memory			1
because of the accolades he received after his martyrdom , @entity3 is often viewed as a charismatic leader who was responsible for the success of the campaign for civil rights reform			1
but many forget his international outlook , including protest of the war in @entity17			0
and history reveals that before he was a civil rights leader he was , first , a preacher , committed to social and economic justice			1
he was only reluctantly a civil rights leader			1
the greatest @entity3 speeches you never heard @entity22 transformed @entity3 into that leader			1
chosen to lead the @entity24 , he quickly gained prominence as the nation 's best - known civil rights spokesperson and advocate of @entity30 nonviolent resistance to the @entity33 @entity32 system			1
but during the six years after the boycott 's successful conclusion , he never planned and carried out a campaign of civil disobedience			0
in 1963 , @entity3 finally had an opportunity to play a leading role in sustained protests in @entity41			1
but even in this campaign to pressure local leaders on the city 's segregation , he came perilously close to failure			0
by early april 1963 , his support among local black leaders had declined , and despite initial enthusiasm of the first mass protests , it became clear that he would not be able to recruit many more protesters willing to engage in civil disobedience through clashes with the forces of police chief @entity55			0
as @entity56 neared , @entity3 realized that bail funds were depleted , and few adult activists were prepared to spend long periods in jail			2
even @entity61 and some of his other colleagues were unwilling to risk arrest if this meant being unavailable to deliver @entity66 sermons in their churches			0
when he made a critical , solitary decision -- his " faith act " -- to submit to arrest on @entity69 , @entity3 was not certain that this decision would result in a successful outcome in @entity41			1
many of his advisers , including his father , had tried to dissuade him from going to jail			0
" i do n't know what will happen or what the outcome will be , " he had admitted to the close associates who gathered in @entity41 's @entity78			2
after he was arrested and placed in solitary confinement , he remembered enduring " the longest , most frustrating and bewildering hours i have lived			0
" @entity3 regained his confidence only after he learned from his lawyer , @entity83 , that entertainer @entity84 had raised $ 50,000 and promised to raise more to provide bail for those willing to go to jail			2
when a group of local white clergymen denounced the @entity41 protests as " unwise and untimely , " @entity3 responded with the letter from his jail cell that would become the most influential defense of civil disobedience since @entity96 's essay on the subject more than a century earlier			1
but @entity3 's letter also expressed a philosophical commitment to nonviolent direct action that he had never previously translated into a nonviolent direction action campaign			0
@entity3 was not able to revive the @entity41 campaign until he allowed himself to be bailed out of jail and gave in to the urging of @entity105 , @entity106 , and other activists that he allow eager teenagers to participate in marches into @entity41 's downtown area , and thereby reinvigorate the flagging protest movement in @entity41			1
when @entity55 responded with fire hoses and police dogs , the clashes in downtown @entity41 attracted the world 's attention			0
in @entity41 , as had been the case in other communities , the courageous actions of young people demonstrated the effectiveness of @entity3 's ideas more than the actions of @entity3 himself			1
due to the timely intervention of thousands of young people , @entity3 was able to secure a settlement with @entity41 's white business leaders			2
he could then claim victory rather than suffer an ignominious defeat			0
@entity3 's success in @entity41 marked a major turning point in his life			2
if he had failed , it is unlikely that he would have been invited to deliver the concluding speech at the @entity136			0
it his even more unlikely that he would he have been given more time than the other speakers that day to share his dream that would enter the nation 's collective consciousness			0
@entity3 's most important contribution to the modern african - american freedom struggle was as an eloquent proponent of civil disobedience , and as a visionary who understood the broader global and historical significance of the @entity149			2
his oratory inspired participants in mass movements that were usually initiated and sustained by others			0
the @entity33 freedom struggle certainly would have eventually achieved major civil rights reforms even after a setback in @entity41 , but it is very doubtful whether we would be talking about @entity3 today if he had failed in @entity41 in 1963			1
a special class with @entity3 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity162 .			2

@entity3 is remembered for his sacrifices and leadership
