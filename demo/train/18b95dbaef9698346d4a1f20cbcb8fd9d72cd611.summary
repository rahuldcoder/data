-- @entity1 does n't look sick			2
the 25 - year - old mother of two is poised			0
sitting in a boardroom at @entity4 , an @entity6 outreach facility in @entity7 where she volunteers , she exudes confidence			1
but @entity10 is hiv positive			0
according to the @entity13 , 50,000 americans are infected with @entity6 each year , and 25 % of those are between the ages of 13 and 24			1
sixty percent of youth with @entity6 do n't know they have it , despite recommendations from the @entity13 , the @entity18 and the @entity19			1
a faceless disease @entity10 got her first @entity6 test as a teenager when someone living with the disease gave a presentation at her high school			1
she was about 16 and already a teen mother at the time			0
she knew she had been having unprotected sex and wanted to stay healthy for her young son			2
at the time , @entity10 was in what she believed was a monogamous relationship			0
during her annual doctor 's visit , she was disturbed to realize she had to ask specifically for an hiv test on top of a standard @entity37 panel			0
she insisted on taking the test even though her doctor told her -- as a heterosexual woman involved in a monogamous relationship -- that she was low risk			0
later @entity10 broke up with her boyfriend and began a new committed relationship			0
that was the year her life changed			0
despite vigilance in testing , @entity10 was n't prepared for what she found out at her doctor 's visit that year : she was @entity6 positive			1
two weeks later she learned she was pregnant with her second child			0
" it was very difficult -- a lot of screaming in my head , a lot of tears -- as if i was going to a funeral every day , " she said			0
the father of @entity10 's baby tested negative for @entity6 and she was able to give birth to a healthy daughter			1
@entity10 believes she contracted the disease from an ex-boyfriend who has not been tested			2
over the past two years , @entity10 has come to a place of acceptance , and she takes personal responsibility for taking a chance with her health by having unprotected sex			0
but in hindsight , she realizes that even though she knew about @entity6 , she did n't fully understand her risk of contracting it			1
" at home we did n't talk about @entity6 because it just did n't exist in my world , " she said			1
" i was aware it was out there , but i did n't know what it looked like			2
" @entity6 does n't have a face , and someone who is infected does n't necessarily exhibit any physical signs			1
" you think that you would see signs that a person is sick , " she said , but since that is n't always the case , teens and young adults can feel a false sense of security			1
they may think , regarding their partner , " we talk all the time , i trust them , so i do n't need to go get tested , " she said			1
@entity10 was n't always open with her status , but now she dedicates much of her time and energy to raising @entity6 awareness because she considers the often imperceptible nature of the disease a factor in its continued transmission			1
love , sex and stigma @entity109 , a prevention specialist and counselor for @entity112 , an @entity7 - based center that offers @entity6 and @entity37 prevention , treatment , and counseling , calls teens ' underestimation of risk part of the " invisible syndrome			1
" @entity109 works primarily with black gay , bisexual and transgendered men , a community that is disproportionately affected by @entity6 and @entity124			1
in 2010 , the @entity13 estimated that 72 % of new hiv infections in young people were transmitted through same - sex , male sexual activity			2
fifty - seven percent of estimated new infections in this age group were in african - americans			0
@entity132 , president and ceo of @entity134 , which supports more than 400 grassroots organizations annually , said that as a young gay man he found it difficult to talk to his doctor about hiv testing			2
despite seeing a doctor regularly for diabetes , @entity141 , now 44 , said his doctor never offered him an hiv test and made assumptions about his sexual orientation			0
" i would say , ' i do n't date girls , ' and hoped he might simply have a clue , but ( he ) never seemed to allow for the fact i could be gay , " @entity141 said			2
he said doctors need to create " an open and accepting environment that talks about sexuality as human nature			0
" " the reality is , today , the majority of @entity6 infections are among men who have sex with men , " @entity141 said			1
" without a doubt , we need broader screening efforts , but i think overall we need broader talk about sexuality in the @entity167			0
" if doctors are n't asking about sexuality and sexual activity , he said , then they miss the opportunity to recommend routine testing to young gay men			1
the reasons that members of this community do n't get tested vary , but there are common threads that touch youth across all demographics , especially questions about what love and sex means after a positive hiv diagnosis			1
" what is sex going to look like ? ... what is life going to look like ? am i going to die ? " these are some of the questions @entity109 hears often from those he counsels			0
the fear of stigma and isolation is great enough that it " will stop people from wanting to know their status , " he said , " but it wo n't stop the sexual behavior that 's happening			2
" for gay , bisexual and transgendered youth , he said , the fear of isolation can be intensified for those with strong religious backgrounds			0
they may feel their faith or community will abandon them because of their sexual identity			0
@entity109 said he has seen this lead to risky behavior , and he urges parents to be involved early in an open dialogue about safe sex			0
this includes recognizing that a message of abstinence does n't always work with teens and young adults , he said , and recognizing that the conversation should be focused on sexual health , not just avoiding pregnancy			1
for a gay teen , he said , preventing pregnancy does n't translate to safer sex			2
@entity109 suggests moving sex and sexual health out of the shadows by making testing a regular family event and using that time as an opportunity to talk about the family 's belief system around partnering , sex and marriage			0
but being open about one 's sexual health is n't always an easy thing -- a lesson @entity10 has learned when she broaches the topic of dating			2
" when i get to the point and i ask someone , ' would you date someone that 's @entity6 positive ? ' a lot of people ca n't answer that question			1
" learning when to disclose her status has become part of the learning curve for @entity10			0
she said being upfront earlier about her status has made things better			0
people respect her honesty and it makes the conversation easier to have			0
other obstacles for a teen , finding and getting to a testing facility can be a challenge all its own			0
@entity262 , prevention programs manager at @entity4 , said she has seen teens struggle to get tested simply because they ca n't get transportation to a testing facility			1
for a high school student , teens must find a location that operates outside of school hours if they do n't want to involve their parents			1
and , if a teen tests positive for @entity6 , their parents may need to get involved anyway			1
" laws differ around the country , but usually if you do test positive for @entity6 and you 're underaged , a parent would have to consent for treatment , " @entity262 said			1
" if a young person may be having other challenges at home , this of course will amplify it			2
" @entity141 thinks easier access to testing is crucial			0
" if kids got to a place where they were routinely offered screening ... they would n't struggle with ' where can i get tested ? who do i talk to about it ? ' and a lot of the stigma would be eradicated , " he said			1
the next hurdle is paying for treatment			0
teens who are too young to have their own health insurance and young adults up to age 25 who are on a parent 's health insurance plan will likely need family support to pay for medication			1
without insurance , they often need to contact the department of health -- an option @entity10 , whose medication runs $ 3,000 a month , finds " terrifying			0
" " at one point , i was so afraid that i was n't going to get health insurance anymore that i stopped taking my medicine , " she said , and hoarded medication because she expected a month - long wait for a doctor 's appointment through the department of health			2
to find @entity6 testing facilities in your area , go to @entity319			1
the next generation @entity10 feels her @entity6 education in high school did n't offer crucial information about testing facilities and local rates of infection -- information you can find on @entity13			1
" in school we learn ( ed ) that @entity6 can lead to @entity124 and @entity124 can lead to death			1
... it 's a fear and that 's it			0
" today , @entity10 is raising two healthy children with the help of her mother , and is educating them early about @entity6			2
the education starts at home , but it is n't always easy			2
@entity10 helped her 9 - year - old son with a project on the stigma of @entity6 , but admitted she was nervous to talk to him about sex			2
" i said , ' if mommy had @entity6 , what would you do ? ' he said he would n't touch me , he would n't kiss me , ( or ) hug me anymore			1
" it opened the door for @entity10 to talk to her son about how @entity6 is transmitted			2
though she did n't tell him her status , she explained to him that @entity6 and @entity124 ca n't be spread though common contact , like hugs and kisses			1
" then ( he ) said , " ok , @entity356 , i 'll hug you			0
and i 'll kiss you			0
i 'll still love you the same			0

a *quarter* of those infected with @entity6 are between the ages of 13 and 24
more than half of youths with @entity6 do n't know they have it
reasons youths do n't get tested can vary *widely*
a message of abstinence may not work for all teens and young adults
