@entity0 may have hosted its first @entity2 grand prix in 2011 , but the sport 's future on the sub-continent could be bleak according to one senior official			1
@entity7 , president of the @entity8 , is the father of @entity10 , one of only two @entity0 drivers to have competed in @entity2			1
the other is @entity13 , who is currently contracted to strugglers @entity14			1
@entity10 told @entity15 that the increasing need for drivers to attract big - money sponsors has made it harder for talented youngsters to break through , especially with @entity2 battling to gain a foothold in @entity0 's sporting spectrum			1
@entity23 takes championship lead after third straight win " after @entity13 and @entity10 , i really ca n't see an @entity0 driver for the next , i would say , eight to 10 years , " @entity10 said ahead of this weekend 's @entity26			1
" @entity2 has become all about money ... it never was earlier , you could find a slot with just talent			2
" the @entity2 teams have decided that even if you 've got talent , let 's have your checkbook as well -- bring in five , 10 , 20 million dollars and let 's give you the seat			1
" according to @entity39 , it could take a figure such as legendary cricketer @entity41 to spark genuine interest in @entity2 among @entity0 's 1.2 billion inhabitants			1
" @entity0 needs heroes , @entity0 needs superheroes like @entity41 , " he said			2
" @entity13 and @entity10 have certainly given the sport , or our sport at least in @entity0 , the slot that it desperately needed			1
" @entity50 handed new @entity52 contract @entity53 's @entity23 won last year 's inaugural race at the @entity55 , near @entity56 , but @entity39 fears interest in the event has dipped since then			1
" there 's been a massive drop in buzz , i do n't know why , " he said			0
" after the first year , we had a sellout crowd in year one of 95,000 people , but year two there has been a dip			0
" i think we will end up with 60,000 spectators in the stands ... ( in @entity0 ) nobody 's used to be parked in long queues just waiting to get to a @entity2 event , having to find passes -- it 's a very sanitized atmosphere			1
" despite @entity39 predicting a drop in attendance figures , @entity75 's @entity74 says 60,000 is still a sizable crowd compared to other dates on the @entity2 calendar			1
" the first year you are always going to get a lot of spectators and a lot of interest , " he told @entity15			2
" it needs to be put in perspective as well -- 60,000 spectators is a huge number of spectators			0
" places like @entity92 did n't get half of that number			0
they might not have as many spectators as last year , but they have still got a hell of a lot more than many other race tracks			0
" the cheapest ticket for the track over the weekend is $ 61.53 in a country where there is widespread poverty			0
@entity74 said the prohibitive ticket prices are a direct result of the millions of dollars which must be paid to host an @entity2 grand prix			2
" it 's a problem all over the world , " he said			0
" you ca n't charge hundreds of pounds for a grandstand seat and then complain you have n't got enough spectators			0
" the tickets prices are astronomical			0
the fees paid to host a grand prix are many millions , so in order to try and recoup some of those funds the tickets prices are high			0
" however , @entity39 hopes @entity2 can develop in @entity0 despite the challenges faced by its race organizers			1
" i do hope that economically and financially it remains viable , " he said			0
" there is a contract between the gp group and @entity2 until 2015			2
" beyond that i do hope that we can sustain it , and if not maybe @entity2 will start to change their approach to rights fees and things like that			2
" it 's very high at $ 40 million , it 's very high for a country like us , but as we start using the facility that is built for it for other uses , like concerts , national events , i think it will be fantastic to try to make this with a really long - term plan			0
i gather it will work			0
