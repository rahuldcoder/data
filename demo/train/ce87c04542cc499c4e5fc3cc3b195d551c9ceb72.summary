-- i rarely agree with justice @entity2 , much less side with him in a public debate			1
but , like @entity2 , i am a believer : i believe in @entity6 and the devil , and i believe it 's bizarre that so many find that belief so curious			1
in a widely discussed @entity12 interview with @entity2 published sunday , journalist @entity13 prods the justice about his legacy until he proclaims , " when i 'm dead and gone , i 'll either be sublimely happy or terribly unhappy			1
" that 's where a discussion of @entity19 , @entity6 and the devil , begins			1
her reaction seems to be that it is outlandish to believe in @entity6 , much less the devil			0
from this point onward , the tension in the interview is palpable			0
yet @entity2 gamely answers her questions about his beliefs			1
yes , he believes in @entity19			0
no , you do n't have to believe in heaven and hell to go to heaven -- everyone 's going one place or the other			1
for me this exchange recalls my first brushes with insistent secularists and atheists			0
i come from @entity41 , buckle of the @entity43 , where few would proudly announce contempt for faith			0
it had not occurred to me before i left @entity41 that my religious beliefs might become a reason to feel alienated			0
i am culturally @entity49 , the product of @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 immigrants , but was not baptized in infancy or confirmed in adolescence			1
as a child , i said the @entity58 because it comforted me , prayed for the souls of the dead because i loved them , but i had n't met a catechism			0
opinion : hey @entity2 , let 's be friends when i moved to @entity66 , @entity67 , for college , i was surprised to confront pervasive , vocal disdain for religion			1
i chalked it up to culture clash : these were brash young adults who 'd seen less of the world than they 'd studied , knew less about actual @entity75 than their counterparts on @entity77			2
in reality , i had just moved from a culture in which faith was presumed to one in which the presumption was against faith			0
@entity2 's awareness of elite bias against belief shows			1
in the interview , he tries to make his beliefs legible to nonbelievers , showing humility and alluding to cultural touchstones			0
he admits , " i do n't even know whether @entity92 is in hell			0
i mean , that 's what the pope meant when he said , ' who am i to judge ? ' " ( if you do n't know @entity92 from the @entity99 , you 'll recognize him from @entity101 's " inferno			2
" ) i can relate : explaining faith , especially dogma , is difficult			0
as many of my peers seemed to be pulling away from formal religion , i opted in : i was baptized and confirmed at 27 -- in a triple - dunk , full - immersion baptism at the university church			2
friends asked , what did my initiation mean -- and why @entity49 ? most queries seemed to demand that i justify my faith ; some exoticized my @entity116 beliefs			2
i do n't have all the answers yet			0
discussing faith in public life is many orders of magnitude harder , but @entity2 tried			2
@entity2 's interviewer was moving on when the justice " stage - whispered , " " i even believe in the @entity123			1
" senior pursues this out of curiosity , presumably , but her questions are inadvertently tinged with condescension : a surprised , " you do ? " even i , a literal neophyte , know most @entity131 believe in the devil in some form or another			2
@entity2 does n't get testy until @entity13 asks , " is n't it terribly frightening to believe in the @entity123 ? " he replies : " you 're looking at me as though i 'm weird			1
my @entity6 ! are you so out of touch with most of @entity75 , most of which believes in the @entity123 ? @entity138 believed in the @entity123 ! it 's in the @entity140 ! " he admonishes , " you travel in circles that are so , so removed from mainstream @entity75 that you are appalled that anybody would believe in the @entity123 ! " senior apologizes , explaining , " it was n't your belief that surprised me so much as how boldly you expressed it			1
" @entity2 replies honestly : " i was offended by that			2
" @entity2 may have been harsh , but he 's not wrong			1
today , as a third - year law student , i sit in seminars with students who scoff at the idea of lawmaking informed by religion , even though most @entity75 are religious			1
i struggle with the question of how to make room for faith in conversations such as these			0
should i interject , offer a different view or suggest lawmakers do n't lightly disregard constituents ' convictions ? the same tensions are present in boardrooms , courtrooms and newsrooms across @entity75 -- @entity12 's interview of @entity2 is just one demonstration			1
i do not offer evidence of the devil , just a proposition for secularists and atheists : even if you do not believe as people of faith do , respect their right to believe and hold opinions informed by belief			0
starting from this position in discourse and debate might inaugurate a long overdue -- and respectful -- dialogue about faith in law and politics			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			0

@entity192 - @entity194 : interview with justice @entity2 took a turn toward religion
interviewer surprised @entity2 believes in devil , and **writer** has faced similar surprise
she says as recent @entity49 she 's been shocked at disdain some elites hold for faithful
**writer** : most in @entity75 are religious , and *policymakers* should n't scoff at such convictions
