@entity0 -- the 2014 elections will continue what has become a staple in @entity6 politics : the survival of powerful political families			1
these are familiar names from a previous generation -- but also for a new one			2
when @entity17 announced her intention to become the next senator from @entity20 this year , she likely evoked voters ' memories of her father , @entity13 , the former vice president			1
the same is true for two politicians in @entity25			0
both the daughter of former sen. @entity11 and a grandson of former president @entity10 will be on the 2014 ballot in the @entity25			1
@entity29 is running for @entity30 , while state sen. @entity31 has launched a bid for governor -- jobs her father and his grandfather , respectively , once held			0
" for their constituents and the @entity6 public , those names are a proven quantity , and as time goes on , you see that @entity6 look back at the history of our political system , and things seem better in hindsight , " said @entity37 of the @entity38			2
" it harkens back to a more collegial political era			2
" candidates and family heritage all over the country , candidates with such familiar names are either running for re-election or jumping into races and using their families ' vast networks to anchor nascent campaigns			1
take a look at the heritage of some of these candidates on the ballot in 2014 : rep. @entity67 of @entity68 is running for her state 's open @entity30 seat			1
her father , @entity71 , was governor of @entity68 for 12 years			0
sen. @entity72 is running for re-election in @entity74			0
her father , " @entity76 " @entity72 , was once mayor of @entity77 and a brother , @entity78 , is now the city 's mayor			0
@entity9 is running for @entity82 land commissioner			1
a member of one of @entity6 's great political dynasties , he 's the grandson of former president @entity86 and nephew of former president @entity88			2
rep. @entity89 of @entity90 is running for re-election			0
a member of one of the most dominant political families in the @entity6 , @entity89 can trace his roots back to four @entity6 senators and @entity97 , one of @entity90 's delegates to the @entity99			1
sen. @entity100 , who is running for re-election in @entity102 , is the son of former sen. @entity103			0
sen. @entity12 of @entity104 , the son of a former congressman , is running for re-election			0
and so is a cousin , @entity106 of @entity107 , also a @entity6 senator			0
a ' ready - made rolodex ' " you grow up around a business , you learn the ropes early , " @entity1 contributor @entity110 said			1
" it is the same reason restaurants or hardware stores -- or junkyards -- have names like ' @entity120			0
' " @entity110 cites many benefits to running as the next in line in a political family , but two stand out : a thick skin and fund - raising			1
" a politician 's kid grows up hearing all kinds of awful things about @entity130 or @entity131 , and they learn that 's not the @entity134 , " he said			2
" toughness matters in politics			0
" @entity110 said that relying on relatives ' fund - raising networks also is unbelievably helpful for these candidates			1
being a @entity13 in @entity20 , a @entity9 in @entity82 or a @entity72 in @entity74 will open many doors -- and wallets			1
it is " hard to estimate how much good president @entity9 41 's network did for @entity88 , " @entity110 said			1
@entity37 added , " you are almost born with a ready - made @entity109			2
" @entity6 dynasties from the early years on the number of political families on the ballot in 2014 is nothing new			1
since the outset of the @entity6 , political families have dominated certain states , and many have risen to national prominence			1
the @entity155 , with the nation 's second president , @entity158 , and sixth president , @entity160 , were among the first political families			1
but certainly not the last			0
the @entity162 have long dominated @entity164 politics , boasting three @entity6 senators , a president , a governor and countless local positions			0
the @entity171 @entity170 family has dominated politics in @entity173 -- with a president , three presidential candidates , three senators , multiple congressmen and dozens of local elected positions			2
a 2012 study of the @entity181 ' political dominance by the @entity182 found the family has logged more than 92 years in congressional service , a number that does n't even count @entity170 's recent term as a representative from @entity188			2
then there are the obvious political families : the @entity191 and @entity192			1
between 1980 and 2008 , a member of one of these families was either president or vice president			0
@entity9 and @entity205 " fatigue " has even become a common term as speculation grows about former @entity200 gov. @entity199 and former secretary of state @entity201 both eyeing a run at the presidency in 2016			2
so why do @entity6 , the same people who revolted against a monarchy in 1776 , keep electing members of the same families ? some political watchers said the continuity these families bring can be comforting to voters , but the public also can sour on candidates who see themselves as anointed successors to their families ' political power			1
@entity37 , however , said the idea that voters are sick of political families is dispelled by the fact that so many of them exist			1
do voters occasionally get sick of one family ? yes , he said			0
but on the whole , such a history is a good thing for candidates , he said			0
" it is helpful that you continue to have generations that bring political experience with them , " @entity37 said			0
" they have more of a knowledge ( of ) what it takes to be a political leader			0

a new generation from well - known political families will show up on the 2014 ballot
from @entity9 to @entity10 to @entity13 to @entity11 , children and *grandchildren* are seeking office
" you grow up around a business , you learn the ropes early , " @entity1 contributor says
*accessibility* to fund - raising networks and tough skin among benefits to such candidates
