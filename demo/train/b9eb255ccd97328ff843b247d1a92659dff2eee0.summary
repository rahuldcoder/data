-- @entity3 's top catholic cardinal is using the " @entity10 defense " in the face of public outrage at his role 35 years ago in investigating one of the country 's most notorious child - abusing priests , an activist said tuesday			2
cardinal @entity13 has been under fire over the investigation into the rev. @entity16			1
the latest scandal comes on the heels of a huge government - backed report that found the @entity21 and other @entity23 authorities in @entity24 covered up child abuse by priests from 1975 to 2004			2
child sexual abuse was " widespread " then , the report found			2
@entity13 's office said tuesday that the cardinal , then a priest and teacher with a doctorate in canon law , had been asked to investigate two complaints against @entity16 in 1975 , but had no decision - making power			1
he reported his findings to bishop @entity38 , his office said , and @entity38 recommended @entity16 get psychiatric help			1
but @entity41 , the founder of @entity3 survivors of @entity43 , said @entity13 should not have remained silent about what he learned in the course of investigating @entity16 , who was later convicted of dozens of counts of child abuse in both @entity24 and the @entity48			1
" he 's basically using the @entity10 defense , he was carrying out orders , " @entity41 said , in reference to the justification many nazis used in their war crimes trials after @entity56 there has been particular outrage over the revelation that two boys who filed complaints against @entity16 were asked to sign confidentiality statements as part of @entity13 's investigation			1
the oaths of secrecy were " to avoid potential collusion " between the two boys as church officials investigated the case , @entity24 's @entity65 said tuesday			1
despite his criticism of @entity13 , @entity41 said it would not necessarily do any good for the cardinal to resign			1
" he 's lost all moral authority to lead , but by replacing him , it wo n't resolve the problem , " he said , arguing that the @entity78 would " just replace guys with other guys			2
" the best solution , he said , would be for the @entity23 to let secular authorities deal with accusations of abuse , rather than trying to handle them itself			2
" they have to accept secular authority , and they can get on with the business of religion , " @entity41 said			0
" it would be in the church 's own interest			0
resignations in themselves are n't the answer			0
" four @entity3 bishops tendered their resignations in the wake of the government - backed report , and pope @entity99 is expected to make a formal statement , or pastoral letter , on the @entity3 abuse issue by @entity103			0
the pope himself has been under fire since it was revealed that a priest suspected of abusing children was allowed to move into his diocese when he was cardinal @entity99 in @entity111 in 1980			1
the @entity112 of @entity113 and @entity114 said in a statement monday it must have been clear at the time that the priest , whom multiple sources identified to @entity0 as @entity118 , was coming to get therapy for allegedly molesting children			0
he was convicted of abuse in 1986 , after @entity99 moved to @entity123			0
@entity118 was suspended on monday			0
hundreds of allegations of sexual or physical abuse of children by catholic clergy have come to light in @entity111 , @entity129 and the @entity130 this year			0
@entity0 's @entity131 in @entity132 , @entity111 , contributed to this report .			0
