-- most @entity2 - bound celebrities spend the better part of that sunday prepping themselves for the cameras -- and the fashion critics			1
they get their hair , makeup and nails done , shimmy into the proper shapewear , adorn themselves with millions of dollars worth of jewelry , slip on a pair of stilettos , and zip up their one - of - a - kind gowns			1
yet , seconds after they step onto the red carpet , we 've already decided whether or not their primping paid off			2
while it takes a mere moment to wind up on the worst - dressed list , it takes a stunning comeback , or two , before redemption is bestowed			2
and with everything that goes into achieving a " best - dressed " - worthy look , attendees are lucky they have an entire season to perfect their red carpet style			2
" each awards show has a different personality style-wise , and people have learned to dress accordingly , " said @entity30 , host of " the thread " on @entity33 's @entity32			1
the @entity2 calls for classic , formal attire , she said , but celebrities can have a little more fun with the @entity40 , the @entity41 and the @entity42 , which allow for edgier ensembles			1
but even a classic look is n't a surefire way to keep the scrutiny at bay			0
see , not taking a fashion risk is a risk in itself , @entity48 said , adding , " it 's important to mix it up			1
" gallery : @entity40 couture that 's exactly what " bridesmaids ' " actress @entity56 did when she showed up at the @entity41 wearing an @entity60 jumpsuit			1
" it 's so great to see anybody step out of the box and do something not so traditional , " said stylist to the stars @entity63 , whose clients include @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			1
" ( @entity72 ) do n't take as many risks on the carpet as they should			0
... because people are so quick to criticize , they 're more careful about their selections			0
" but red carpet couture is n't about setting a trend			0
it 's about wearing something flattering in a style you love , said the new mom , who has n't outfitted anyone this awards season			1
one red - carpet regular who has stunned this season , wearing gowns that complement her shape , is " the help 's " @entity92 , said @entity33 's @entity48			1
and with so many nominations for best actress in a supporting role -- she won the award at the @entity40 and the @entity41 , among other shows -- @entity99 is being watched closely			1
the actress has developed a relationship with @entity102 , the @entity103 designer behind the lavender gown she wore to the @entity40 , and the silver number she donned for the @entity41			1
" my mom always taught us to dance with the one that brung ya , and ( @entity102 ) gave me a lot of clothes while we were on ( " the help " ) publicity tour , " @entity99 told @entity106 it 's common for a celebrity to have a relationship with certain designers , @entity48 said , referencing @entity120 , who wore a standout pale pink @entity123 gown to the @entity40			1
( @entity124 is a spokesperson for @entity123			0
) @entity48 anticipates that @entity99 will continue her " classy and fashion forward " streak at the @entity2 on sunday , possibly with another @entity102 creation			1
gallery : couture at the @entity41 " the red carpet is a very intense situation , and you want to be comfortable out there , " @entity131 said			1
" if you 're confident and comfortable , it reads			0
it you 're uncomfortable , no matter how beautiful your dress is , it can end up not working			0
" the potential for discomfort is one reason footwear expert @entity143 says shoes are the most important part of any red carpet look			1
" ( shoes ) have the biggest effect on how you feel , " said @entity143 , the author of " shoe are you ? " " they have an actual physiological effect on you -- the way you walk and carry yourself , and the way you stand			0
" even for the @entity2 , which calls for mostly floor - length gowns , " shoes are still in the game , " she said			2
@entity143 expects most shoes on @entity2 night to be delicate stiletto sandals , with jewels and metallic detail			0
" a lot of times the shoe becomes part of the jewelry			0
" and with so much focus on the dress , shoes become a way for celebrities to experiment , and maybe take a fashion risk			1
@entity143 says pairing a purple metallic stiletto with a red dress would create a fashion - forward and edgy formal look			2
" i say go for it			0
kudos to you , " she said			0
" but will you be excoriated on the red carpet for that ? i do n't know			0
" as a celebrity stylist , @entity131 says she gravitates toward the rich colors during awards season , because the hues tend to show off detail better than pastels or black numbers			0
plus , she said , publications are more likely to run photos of stars wearing bright - colored gowns -- like the scarlet @entity192 that @entity193 wore to the @entity41			1
the saturated , rich jewel tones are all over the red carpet this season , like the jade green @entity198 dress @entity200 wore to the @entity41 , or the fuchsia @entity204 gown @entity202 donned the same night			1
on the flip side , nude - colored gowns have also been all the rage this awards season -- @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210 have all tried out the trend , somewhat unsuccessfully			2
( each celebrity ended up on at least one media outlet 's worst - dressed list , in addition to getting burned on @entity106 's " @entity216			2
" ) a nude gown is " so incredibly stunning in real life , yet , just does n't translate on tv or in photos , " @entity131 said			0
just because a gown looks good in person , she added , it does n't mean it will translate for the cameras , which is why @entity131 always photographs her clients in a gown before a final decision is made			0
@entity131 said she expects to see a mix of vibrant , nude and sherbet colors take over at the @entity2			0
but she 's excited to see what some of the newcomers will pull out on the carpet			2
" there are a bunch of ... cool , young , beautiful girls experimenting with fashion , " she said , giving a nod to @entity237 , who has been playing with cutouts and black and white			2
in the end , any celebrity can end up on a list of best - or worst - dressed stars			0
but the fashionistas who push the envelope are the ones we 'll be talking about long after awards season .			0
