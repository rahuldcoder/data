-- the @entity1 stood by its security officers sunday after a @entity4 woman complained that her cancer - stricken , 95 - year - old mother was patted down and forced to remove her adult diaper while going through security			1
reports of the incident took hold in social media , with scores of comments on the topic and reposts appearing hourly on @entity15 sunday afternoon			0
the @entity1 released a statement sunday defending its agents ' actions at the @entity19			1
" while every person and item must be screened before entering the secure boarding area , @entity1 works with passengers to resolve security alarms in a respectful and sensitive manner , " the federal agency said			1
" we have reviewed the circumstances involving this screening and determined that our officers acted professionally and according to proper procedure			1
" @entity32 told @entity0 's @entity33 on sunday that the security officers may have been procedurally correct , but she still does not believe they were justified , especially given her mother 's frail condition			2
" if this is your procedure -- which i do understand -- i also feel that your procedure needs to be changed , " she said			2
@entity32 said the two were traveling june 18 from northwest @entity4 to @entity41 , so her mother could move in with relatives before eventually going to an assisted living facility			2
" my mother is very ill , she has a form of leukemia , " @entity32 said			0
" she had a blood transfusion the week before , just to bolster up her strength for this travel			0
" while going through security , the 95 - year - old was taken by a @entity1 officer into a glassed - in area , where a pat - down was performed , @entity32 said			1
an agent told @entity32 " they felt something suspicious on ( her mother 's ) leg and they could n't determine what it was " -- leading them to take her into a private , closed room			0
soon after , @entity32 said , a @entity1 agent came out and told her that her mother 's @entity69 was " wet and it was firm , and they could n't check it thoroughly			1
" the mother and daughter left to find a bathroom , at the @entity1 officer 's request , to take off the adult diaper			1
@entity32 said she burst into tears during the ordeal , forcing her own pat - down and other measures in accordance with @entity1 protocol			1
but she said her mother , a nurse for 65 years , " was very calm " despite being bothered by the fact that she had to go through the airport without underwear			0
eventually , @entity32 said she asked for her mother to be whisked away to the boarding gate without her , because their plane was scheduled to leave in two minutes and @entity32 was still going through security			0
by this weekend , the 95 - year - old woman -- who was not identified by name -- was doing " fine " in @entity41 , where her niece and her family " was treating her like royalty because they love her so much			1
" " my mother is a trouper , " @entity32 said			0
this is not the first time that the @entity1 's pat - downs of passengers have come under fire , nor the first time that the agency has rallied behind its officers and policy			1
last year , the administration announced it was ramping up the use of full - body scanning and pat - downs to stop nonmetallic threats , including explosives , from getting on planes			2
the goal is to head off attacks such as the one allegedly attempted in christmas 2009 by @entity117 , who allegedly had a bomb sewn into his underwear on a flight from the @entity121 to @entity41			0
the @entity1 estimates that only 3 % of passengers are subjected to pat - downs -- and then only after they have set off a metal detector or declined to step into a full - body scanner			1
yet the new policy has triggered an uproar online and in airports , from a relatively small but vocal number of travelers who feel their rights and privacy were being violated			0
but the federal safety agency has n't backed down , making some adjustments but no major changes to its policy			0
" every traveler is a critical partner in @entity1 's efforts to keep our skies safe , " administrator @entity136 , who ordered the new approach , said last fall			1
" and i know and appreciate that the vast majority of @entity143 recognize and respect the important work we do			0
" more recently , outrage erupted over a video - recorded pat - down of a 6 - year - old passenger last april at @entity151 ' airport			1
the video , which was posted on @entity153 , shows the girl protesting the search by a female security officer at first , though she complies quietly while it is underway			0
@entity136 addressed this controversy at a @entity160 meeting last week , explaining the pat - down was ordered because the child had moved while passing through a body imaging machine			0
he told committee members that " we have changed the policy ( so ) that there 'll be repeated efforts made to resolve that without a pat - down			2
" the next day , @entity1 spokesman @entity171 said that the new policy -- which will apply to children age 12 and younger -- is in the process of being rolled out			2
it will give security officers " more options , " but does not eliminate pat - downs as one of them			2
" this decision will ultimately reduce -- though not eliminate -- pat - downs , " @entity171 said .			0

a 95 - year - old woman was held up by @entity1 officers at a @entity4 airport , her daughter says
the agents forced the cancer - stricken woman to take off her adult diaper , she adds
the @entity1 *insists* its officers " acted professionally and according to proper procedure "
the woman 's daughter says those procedures should be changed
