-- @entity2 - born businessman @entity1 is all too familiar with the daily challenges of setting the strategy and overseeing the operations of a global company			1
over the last three years , the @entity8 - based executive , who served as a government minister in @entity2 in the 1990s , has been at the helm of @entity11 , a life insurance giant and financial services group with a 160 - year history and more than 26 million customers in @entity15 , the @entity16 and the @entity17			1
but for @entity1 , the first black ceo of a @entity19 company , being a cabinet minister in @entity2 was much tougher than heading a global company			1
" the difficulty you have when you work in an emerging market is you never have enough , " he says			2
" it 's very tough because it 's like being asked to choose between cutting your right arm or your left arm			2
so every decision is very painful , engages lives , has a huge impact on how people live , whether they live or not , and if you take that responsibility seriously it can be quite heavy			2

he made his first professional steps in @entity44 and @entity45 and in 1994 he returned to @entity46 to be in charge of @entity2 's infrastructure projects			1
but in 1999 , while @entity1 was abroad , a military coup overthrew @entity2 's government			1
@entity1 returned to the country and was initially put under house arrest			1
he was then asked to work for the new regime but @entity1 refused the offer and returned to @entity55 to work in the private sector			1
@entity1 spoke to @entity0 's @entity57 about @entity11 , @entity2 and what it takes to be a good leader			1
an edited version of the interview follows			2
@entity0 : being the first @entity46 to run a big @entity19 company , that kind of discussion that comes back at you a lot , does n't it ? @entity1 : it does -- i try to stay away from it and to move away from it , but fundamentally it 's not a real issue			1
fundamentally i think you just have to be yourself , that 's the only thing you can do anyway and that 's the only way to live your life			2
@entity0 : @entity11 is very much a multicultural organization			1
what are the tricks to running a global business in today 's environment ? @entity84 : the the only thing you can do is to be authentic			0
people have their own filters to look at you and to decode what you are saying or what you are doing according to their own cultural references , but i think one thing people can read across cultures is whether you 're being genuine or not			0

@entity84 : it 's very different			0
the difficulty you have when you work in an emerging market or emerging economy is you never have enough			0
for instance , often i had to get involved in the public investment process and frankly if i added all the requests we had when we did the budget every year , it was between 50 and a 100 times the resources we had			0
in the @entity121 , when you budget you 're going to get 20 , 30 % more than what you have , not 50 times or a 100 times , and frankly i think each and every one of those requests were legitimate			0
so if you have to go from 50 to one , it 's very tough because it 's like being asked to choose between cutting your right arm or your left arm , so every decision is very painful , engages lives , has a huge impact on how people live , whether they live or not , and if you take that responsibility seriously it can be quite heavy			2
the consequences of the decisions you make are of a completely different magnitude on a human level			0
@entity0 : you very much charted a new road in terms of privatizations , that was in a way revolutionary in @entity46			1
@entity84 : it 's not complicated , we had no money , as the president put it			0
the first challenge he gave me was			0
" look ... we have a drought , the dams are empty , we need a power plant but we have no money so i need you to build a power plant			0
" that was my first job , so yes , i think if you do n't have money , you have to be creative			0
so it was actually very exciting			0
we had to go out and innovate , frankly it 's as much out of necessity that we went and raised private capital			0
watch : rebuilding @entity2 's cocoa trade @entity0 : you rejected the military regime 's offer			1
i 've read that you 've said that the period after the coup was a very lonely time			2
@entity84 : i have to say the coup was popular , people did not understand my position , my position was a position of principle ... a lot of so - called democrats were applauding the coup and i 'm saying this is really short - term thinking and it 's very poor thinking -- because it is bad for democracy that in one of the few countries in @entity46 where there had never been a coup and i was absolutely convinced that it was all going to go wrong and there was no stopping it			1
watch : how a coup made a ceo because in countries with weak institutions once you 've allowed someone to take a minister or cabinet member and make him crawl with his @entity193 , that 's it -- it 's going to happen over and over and over again			1
it 's always wrong to build your power on military might ... because someone will always have a bigger gun than you			2
there 's always someone who 's got a bigger muscle than you or a bigger stick than you , a bigger baseball bat and he can always break your skull , that 's why we have a rule of law , that 's why we have civilization			0
@entity0 : you get angry , do n't you ? @entity84 : yes , it 's just unnecessary			0
we are the poorest , we are the weakest , we are divided -- if on top people are going to fight each other , what chances do we have ? i go to @entity15 , you get to @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 , i challenge you to see a difference between sunday and monday -- there are seven days in a week and they use those seven days to work and to produce			0
so if we spend our time fighting each other while others are working together toward a goal , we should n't be surprised if we fall behind .			0
