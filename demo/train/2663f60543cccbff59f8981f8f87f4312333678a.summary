@entity0 -- a new political reality hits @entity0 next week , with the first split @entity4 since 2002 raising questions about whether the bipartisan cooperation of the recently concluded lame - duck session can continue			1
conventional wisdom says the shift from one party controlling both chambers , as @entity12 have done since 2006 , to the @entity13 taking over the @entity14 and holding a stronger minority stake in the @entity16 means increased partisan impasse over the next two years			2
but that same conventional wisdom got turned on its head after november 2 , when the electoral " shellacking " delivered to president @entity20 and the @entity12 was followed by one of the most productive post-election congressional conclusions in history			1
@entity14 press secretary @entity25 attributed the new bipartisanship of the post-election period to the @entity13 gains in the november vote			2
" there was a responsibility of government that i think the @entity13 got in the november elections and they began to understand that responsibility a little bit more in this lame - duck session than they had in the previous , quite frankly , 18 months or so , " @entity25 said sunday on @entity1 's " @entity30			1
" republicans can no longer afford to " simply sit and say no , " @entity25 said , referring to the obstructive posture that @entity13 leaders generally struck in @entity20 's first two years in office			1
instead , he called for @entity13 to be part of a constructive conversation , at least in 2011 before the presidential campaign of 2012 really heats up			2
some liberals accused @entity20 of giving in too easily to @entity13 demands on some issues , particularly in cutting a deal that extended @entity51 - era tax cuts to everyone after @entity20 had campaigned on allowing tax rates of the wealthy to return to higher levels			1
@entity14 senior adviser @entity55 told the @entity57 program " @entity65 " that the new reality in @entity0 requires such compromise in order to do what 's best for the @entity63 people , rather than one political party or another			0
the tax deal , while giving @entity13 the extended cuts they wanted as well as a lower estate tax than scheduled , also provided extended jobless benefits and other tax credits sought by @entity20 and @entity12 , @entity66 noted			1
" we ca n't ignore the realities of the membership and the makeup of @entity4 and the fact that we are going to need bipartisan support to get things done , " @entity66 said			2
the tax deal was followed by congressional approval of a series of @entity12 - supported measures that had been held up by @entity13 opposition , including a major nuclear arms treaty with @entity84 and the repeal of the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy banning openly gay and lesbian service members from the military			2
now , the issues only get tougher			0
with unemployment still close to 10 percent and the federal deficit continuing to expand , @entity20 and leaders of both parties say they need to find a way to both accelerate recovery from economic recession while devising long - term policies and strategies to better balance revenue and spending			1
a sweeping deficit reduction plan devised by a bipartisan commission appointed by @entity20 recommended spending cuts , tax increases , adjustments to @entity107 and other proposals normally considered politically taboo			1
the plan won approval from a majority of the panel numbers , but lacked enough support to require a congressional vote on it			0
@entity25 said @entity20 wants to strengthen @entity107 and @entity116 to ensure future solvency while also addressing the growing federal deficit and one of his top priorities -- improving education in the @entity63			1
however , @entity13 have made clear that cutting spending is their top priority			0
incoming house speaker @entity124 , @entity125 , is promising weekly votes on spending cuts , and conservative @entity128 sen. @entity128 of @entity129 warned of a national catastrophe if the deficit does n't get reduced			1
" there will not be one @entity63 that will not be called to sacrifice " under the needed spending cuts to deal with the deficit , @entity128 said on " @entity132			2
" while acknowledging that " those that are more well - to - do will be called to sacrifice to a greater extent " -- a traditional @entity12 stance -- @entity128 said the increased spending of the past decade under both @entity20 and former president @entity51 required immediate and significant cuts to show financial markets and investors here and abroad that the @entity63 is serious about balancing its books			1
the tax deal means that hundreds of billions of dollars that would have been raised in higher income taxes and expired tax cuts will instead get spent in the economy , @entity128 noted			0
" so i think there is no problem that we could cut $ 100 or $ 200 billion and start making a down payment and come to an agreement " on deficit reduction , @entity128 said			2
" there does n't have to be a standoff			0
what there has to be is real leadership and recognizing the serious nature and the urgency of our problem			0
" he rejected criticism by fellow conservatives for supporting the deficit reduction plan of the bipartisan commission , which included increased tax revenue rejected by many on the political right			0
" i 'm not in the @entity16 for the @entity13 , " said @entity128 , who won re-election last month for his second and what he insisted would be his final six - year term			1
" i 'm in the @entity16 for @entity63 and for the future of our country			0
and if we are going to measure everything by @entity13 / @entity182 , we 're going to continue down this course that is going to result in our failure			0
" @entity66 indicated @entity20 sought a middle road , noting he had shown his willingness to work with @entity13 but also would " fight very hard " for eventually ending the lower tax rates for the wealthiest @entity63			1
throughout his presidency , she noted , @entity20 had taken necessary steps -- " some of them unpopular " -- to deal with the financial crisis he faced on taking office and now to reach the tax compromise			0
" what he realizes is that he had to be pragmatic , but he was being pragmatic in order to deliver for the @entity63 people , " @entity66 said , later adding : " the @entity63 people expect him to lead			0
he is everybody 's president , regardless of party affiliation			0
" @entity1 's @entity203 contributed to this story .			0
