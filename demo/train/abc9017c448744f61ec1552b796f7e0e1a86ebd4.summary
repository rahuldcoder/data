@entity0 -- patients being treated on the floor , because emergency rooms are overcrowded , medical sources say			1
and , according to a @entity10 spokesman , fuel shortages such that only half the available ambulances can run and the generators powering lights in hospitals might only last a few more days			0
sources there say that is the reality nowadays in @entity18 , a dire situation that looks like it will persist or perhaps get worse -- since neither @entity20 nor @entity22 's government have shown any indication of backing down			1
@entity24 being fired from @entity18 into @entity22 are menacing and can be dangerous			1
case in point came friday , when a woman was hurt after a rocket hit a house in @entity30 , according to @entity22 's military			2
every day , there are more such attacks , each one potentially lethal			0
earlier friday , for instance , @entity34 reported that two soldiers were lightly wounded in an attack by an anti-tank missile			0
hostilities between the two sides picked up weeks ago -- tensions that were exacerbated by the kidnapping and killing of three @entity22 teenagers			2
there 's a disparity in the human toll in the latest fighting			0
no @entity22 have been killed so far by the hundreds of rockets fired toward southern @entity22 by @entity20 , @entity50 and other militant groups in @entity18			1
some @entity22 have been wounded			2
more than 100 people -- including at least 23 children and 24 women -- have been killed and nearly 800 others have been injured in @entity18 from @entity22 strikes , according to dr. @entity57 , the spokesman for @entity18 's health ministry			1
the toll kept rising saturday , after an @entity22 strike in @entity61 in northern @entity18 that @entity20 security sources said killed members of the @entity50 militant group			1
those places where the injured are being treated are n't necessarily safe havens , either : @entity57 told @entity1 that at least one hospital in @entity18 was shelled			2
the medical sources who described the overcrowded emergency rooms in @entity18 and dwindling supply of medicine characterized what is happening there as not unlike the chaos witnessed at @entity75 hospitals during its civil war			1
and even those not in hospitals or who have n't been impacted directly by airstrikes face significant challenges			0
@entity1 staff in @entity18 reported there are rolling blackouts , and there are water shortages in some areas because airstrikes have damaged pumping stations			2
@entity22 authorities insist that they want peace , and that they are striking back in order to defend their territory			2
as things stand , they contend , doing nothing is not a valid option			0
to that point , prime minister @entity95 reiterated friday that there is one path to a cease - fire : the cessation of attacks from @entity18			2
observers wonder whether @entity22 will escalate its defense with even more offense -- by sending troops into @entity18			1
nothing is off the table , @entity95 said			0
" we are considering all options and getting ready for every possible scenario , " he said			0
" all the citizens of @entity22 are aware of my major goal , and this is to bring back the quiet to all @entity22 territories			2
@entity20 keeps attacking us , and therefore we are fighting them back			1
" rocket from @entity116 @entity22 faced attack from a second front friday , but it is unlikely that a rocket fired from @entity116 signifies the widening of the conflict with @entity20			1
the rocket launched from @entity116 landed near the northern @entity22 town of @entity124 , which sits right by the @entity116 border , and no damage or injuries have been reported			2
it was not immediately clear who fired the rocket			0
an @entity34 spokesman said @entity22 holds the @entity116 government responsible for the attack , but concerns that @entity22 will face a two - front conflict are unlikely to be realized			0
@entity135 , which operates in @entity116 and is caught up in other conflicts in the region , probably does not have the appetite to start a war with @entity22			1
thousands of rockets were fired from @entity116 into @entity22 during a war in 2006 , but rocket attacks since then have been sporadic			1
tensions are always high between @entity135 and @entity22 , but @entity135 's involvement in @entity75 's civil war means that a fight with @entity22 might not make sense			1
nonetheless , @entity22 responded with artillery that landed in the vicinity of the @entity116 town of @entity151			0
no casualties were reported , the @entity116 army said			0
@entity22 calls up reservists as fears of an @entity22 ground assault grew among @entity18 residents thursday , @entity22 revealed it has beefed up its forces by calling about 30,000 reservists to their units			1
" we are utilizing that force to enable us to create a substantial force around @entity18 , that if it is required , we 'll be able to mobilize as soon as possible , " @entity34 spokesman @entity161 told @entity1 's @entity162			0
the @entity22 cabinet has authorized the military to call up 40,000 troops if needed			0
that is 10,000 more than were called up during @entity22 's offensive into @entity18 in november 2012			1
the @entity34 said friday that since the start of @entity172 , more than 570 rockets have been fired at @entity22			0
the country 's @entity174 defense system has intercepted more than 100 of them , the @entity34 said			0
@entity20 and other militant groups in @entity18 are believed to have about 10,000 rockets of varying ranges , according to the @entity22 military			1
@entity22 has said some 3.5 million residents live in areas within reach of the rockets			0
@entity184 willing to help broker cease - fire hopes for a cease - fire appeared dim even as world leaders called for the two sides to stop the violence			0
@entity184 president @entity191 and @entity95 spoke by phone			0
" the @entity184 remains prepared to facilitate a cessation of hostilities , including a return to the november 2012 cease - fire agreement , " the @entity193 said in a written statement , referring to the @entity196 - brokered deal that halted the previous @entity22 - @entity20 conflict			1
the president also condemned rocket attacks from @entity18 and said the @entity184 reaffirmed @entity22 's right to defend itself			1
from @entity204 to @entity22 - @entity206 fighting flare - up in @entity22 - @entity206 violence : why now ? has the @entity210 crisis reached a tipping point ? was teen 's death a revenge killing ? @entity1 's @entity215 reported from @entity0 , @entity216 wrote this report in @entity218 , and @entity1 's @entity219 reported from @entity220			1
@entity1 's @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity226 and @entity227 contributed to this report .			0
