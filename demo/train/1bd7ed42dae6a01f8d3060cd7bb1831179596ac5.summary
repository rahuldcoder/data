-- he refers to himself as the industry 's last remaining dinosaur , but @entity4 is the pioneering @entity5 engineer who can consistently claim to be ahead of the curve			1
the 53 - year - old 's designs have delivered a total of 10 world titles , spread across three different constructors , putting the @entity11 in a class of his own			1
after successful spells with @entity14 and @entity15 , @entity4 is now chief technical officer at @entity16 , where he produced the cars that swept @entity18 to back - to - back championships in 2011 and 2012 alongside double manufacturers ' crowns			1
he can also count legends of the sport such as @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 as those who have triumphed under his hand since he started working in motor racing in 1980			1
@entity32 sat down with @entity4 at @entity16 's @entity34 base to quiz him on his designs , his method of working and why he still prefers drawing by hand			1
how do you stay ahead of the curve every season ? the design job is part iteration and part blue sky / light bulb - type thing			2
so if regulations are stable , quite often it 's evolution in the @entity50 sense of the word , but occasionally we 'll come up with a new idea which is not a derivation of what we 've been doing , it 's coming from left field			1
so it 's really about trying to get that blend of evolution and revolution			1
where do you get your " light bulb " moments ? they can come from anywhere			2
i quite often find that if i think about a problem for a while , store it , walk away and do something else ... the brain is an amazing thing			2
it seems to tick away on a problem			2
sometimes the solution will pop up in the shower the next day , the next week			1
i 'm sure we all have different ways of working and i 'm obviously not the only person coming up with ideas			2
it 's a big engineering company now			1
the rules change every season			2
do you relish it as a challenge or is it a headache ? i enjoy regulation changes if they give new opportunities			1
the big changes we had at the start of 2009 gave all sorts of new opportunities ; different ways to approach things , do n't simply do things the way we 've always done and really try to think what are we trying to achieve here , what is the best solution or set of solutions to suit new regulations			1
what i do n't enjoy so much is when the regulations simply become more restrictive , when things that we 're doing become banned			2
i think the danger there is that if the regulations become excessively restrictive , then all the cars will be the same and it will effectively be a runway chassis format			2
you are well known for your low - tech approach to what is ultimately a very high - tech product -- you draw a lot of your designs			2
how do you reconcile that ? in terms of communicating my ideas and developing my ideas , i work on a drawing board -- as opposed to all my colleagues now , who are obviously on computer - aided design ( @entity122 ) systems			2
i guess i 'm the last dinosaur in the industry			2
i view it simply as a language			2
it 's the way of taking an idea in the head -- typically i 'll take an idea , sketch it on a bit of paper and then develop it on the drawing board			1
now , of course , as everything has to go onto the @entity122 system , i 'm lucky enough to have a team of two or three people who take my drawings and convert them into electronic images			2
but whether you use a drawing board or go straight to the cad i think it 's really a personal preference			1
that 's the way i grew up and i 'm afraid i 'm getting a bit too much of a creature of habit to change			1
have you ever been forced to try the newer design technology ? when @entity122 first came in during the early 1990s , then various people -- particularly when i was at @entity14 -- said i ought to really be changing			1
perhaps at that time when i was still in my 30s , i should have done			2
but i like the freedom of drawing , the fact that you can sketch very easily , you can rub out , you can change , you can freehand			0
when i watch people on the cad system now , that 's still a weakness to me of the cad system -- the freehand ability and the ability to change things very quickly and easily with a rubber is not there			1
what are the things that you are most proud of ? certainly the first @entity5 cars -- i was involved in the @entity169 / march team from 1988			1
we were a very small team			0
it was only two aerodynamicists i think , including myself , on the car			0
the total engineering team was five or six people			0
we were stuck with an abnormally aspirated engine which had far less power than the turbocharged engines of the era			0
so we set out to build an as aerodynamically - efficient car as we could			0
that car i think genuinely changed the direction of @entity5 at the time			1
the cars had become quite big and clumsy and our little march was , despite being well done on power , was able to get ahead of @entity15 and @entity185 and @entity14 , just by being aerodynamically efficient			1
of course other people recognized that and over the coming years increasingly cars became a clone of the 1988 car			0
which of your innovations do you think have stood the test of time ? certainly my route has always been to try to put aerodynamics first and foremost in the design of the car because that 's the biggest performance differentiator			1
and that really is something now that is generally accepted -- everybody does that			0
but in the 1980s when i first started that was n't the norm			0
people tended to design the car mechanically first and foremost , and then the aerodynamicist was given the job of trying to fit the bodywork to it			0
i think that philosophy is still in good stead			0
it 's trying to recognize where do you get the biggest bang for your buck in terms of performance and then design accordingly			1
can you talk through the process from design to the road ? you have a set of regulations , you then do the layout of the car , which obviously satisfies the regulations initially perhaps first and foremost , and then try to look for opportunities and try to develop ideas around that			1
once you have an aerodynamic concept together , that has to be transferred to a mechanical package that will physically transmit the aerodynamics to the road , the suspension , to hold all the vital things to drive with ; the fuel , the engine			0
so typically we have to work to league time schedules and the longest league time is the chassis itself -- what we call the monocoque , which holds the front suspension , contains the driver and contains the fuel tank			0
to the back of that is bolted the engine , which we are supplied by @entity255			0
so we are not involved in the engine , other than how we install it in the car			0
then the other long league up item is the gearbox , which we do ourselves			0
it 's a carbon composite case			1
so the monocoque and the carbon gear box case are the things we have to first get out as a piece of design			0
their shapes need to at least be designed by late august , early september to meet the league times necessary for the following year			0
then once you have those big two items out , you go through and tick off the list of remaining items : suspension upright , suspension so on and so forth			0
do the legacy of your designs and innovation go beyond @entity5 ? when i first started teams typically had five engineers or less , so there was very little research capability			1
it was purely a design job to design the car almost with the least amount of effort you could , as you just did n't have the resource			0
today the top @entity5 teams will have over 100 engineers , maybe as much as 130			1
so we have a tremendous research capability			0
that has meant that instead of it almost being something that general engineering took no notice of , we are now able to contribute to engineering developments in the same way as aerospace and automotives			0
we will typically go from a blank sheet of paper to a complete in a space of around six months , and that 's something which the aeronautical sector in particular is fascinated by because they have league times which are more like 10 years			1
so we borrow off them and in some areas they borrow off us now			0
when you get up in the morning , what 's main thing driving you ? i just enjoy the job			1
i enjoy the blend of design engineering , working with my fellow engineers , my colleagues here at @entity16 , working with the drivers , working with the mechanics and that blend of design and competition that we 're out there every couple of weeks being measured on how we 're doing -- which if it 's going well it 's great , and if it 's going poorly it 's a lot of pressure			1
what is so fascinating about motor racing is that blend of design and competition , and it really does n't exist anywhere else			0
yes of course there is technology in bicycles , tennis rackets and whatever but the budgets and the research are much smaller			0
we get to play with quite a grownup budget and we can get involved in lots of areas as a result of that			0
what 's more important -- the driver or the car ? the answer is you have to have the combination			1
there are three principle things : the driver ; the chassis , or the car less the engine ; and the engine itself			0
the main performance differentiator on the chassis is the aerodynamics			0
so to win races you 've got to have a good driver , good aerodynamics and a good engine			0
if you do n't have that combination you might win the odd race but you certainly wo n't win championships .			0
