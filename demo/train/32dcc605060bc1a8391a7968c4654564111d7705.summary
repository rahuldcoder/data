-- access to affordable and high quality higher education should be a universal right			2
a free and prosperous society needs an educated citizenry to innovate and thrive			0
today in @entity8 , we 're a long way from that goal			0
unfortunately , the highly touted plan from @entity12 to provide increased tuition assistance does n't really help -- and might hurt			1
on monday , @entity12 announced that it would help cover much of the cost of two years of education at @entity16 for its employees			1
the rhetoric , driven by @entity12 ceo @entity19 , has been lofty			1
on " @entity23 , " he said , " today we will become the first @entity8 company to provide free college tuition for all our employees			1
" the crowd went wild			0
on @entity0 , @entity26 and dr. @entity27 , president of @entity28 , positioned it as a way to attack the national student debt crisis			0
@entity27 said , " can it tackle these national issues ? the answer is absolutely yes			2
" secretary of education @entity35 attended the announcement of the plan and said , " think of the example you can set for the rest of the nation , " @entity35 said			1
" if you guys can do this well ... you 're going to change the trajectory of the entire country			0
" @entity26 , @entity27 , and @entity35 seem to believe they are on the cusp of a new education revolution , disrupting their way to a better @entity8 higher - ed landscape			2
in fact , it would be a terrible thing for education to become another employer - dependent benefit			2
this new program may help some @entity12 employees by providing access to online classes , but it will do nothing to attack structural problems such as the national student debt crisis or skyrocketing tuition rates ( 1,200 % in 30 years ! )			1
rather , the need for such a benefit is a confirmation that the system is broken			0
first of all , the @entity12 plan does not really " provide free college tuition " for every employee			1
what it does is offer reimbursement for a certain number of credits completed at @entity78			0
most large employers , in fact , offer various kinds of tuition reimbursement , but the scale and specific relationship between @entity12 and @entity28 is unusual , especially because @entity28 is absorbing considerable upfront costs by discounting its tuition			1
@entity12 is , of course , a for - profit company			1
@entity78 , meanwhile , functions as a profitable educational institution nestled within a large public university			0
therefore , the new policy needs to be viewed not as a public service , but as a deal struck between two companies interested in their image and profit margins			0
@entity12 is gaining lots of great @entity97 from the roll out of the policy			1
it also will likely improve employee morale and actually help some of them get educations			0
@entity28 , in the meantime , gets access to potentially thousands of new students it does not have to recruit , all of whom will eventually bring additional revenue to the university through student loans , federal grants and @entity12			2
so long as @entity12 employees get good advice both from within the benefits office and access to good college advising , i think it 's a net positive for both institutions and the employees			1
the margin , though , is slim			0
@entity121 , professor of educational policy studies and sociology at the @entity123 , argues that wholly online education is of questionable value for low - income students			0
this is especially a problem when such students are required to pay for those first 21 credits before they qualify for reimbursement			0
moreover , most of the money here is coming from the government and loans , not @entity12			2
as @entity139 , writer and sociologist , notes , the use of public funds to support online for - profit education has a long and shady history			0
none of these concerns has stopped the @entity12 pr team from trumpeting their great accomplishment			2
in one telling moment , @entity26 compared the tuition benefit to @entity12 ' decision to give health care to its workers			1
that 's a comparison worth exploring			0
the development of health care as an employee benefit rather than a universal right has been a disaster for @entity8 , leading to high costs and poor results			1
yes , the employees are much better off with health care than without , much as some workers will benefit from the new tuition policy			1
but if making college affordable becomes a job perk , rather than a societal goal , we 're collectively worse off			1
instead , would n't it be great if employees could just pay for college with their wages , rather than needing a special , highly restrictive , benefit ? we can rescue higher education in @entity8 from its current cost spiral , and we should , by acting at the national level			1
we need to change the structure of how we pay for college , a process that will take hard work across party lines			0
unfortunately , last week a bill that would have radically reduced student loan interest rates for everyone stalled in the @entity181			0
and so , while we wait for the government to act , we 're stuck relying on @entity12 .			2

@entity184 : @entity12 *launches* college program for its employees
he says the plan is n't the answer to the rising cost of college
@entity184 says we ca n't let college education become a job perk , as health care did
there are pluses to the @entity12 plan , but it 's not a model for the nation , @entity184 says
