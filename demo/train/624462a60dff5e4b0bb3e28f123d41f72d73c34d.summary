-- the @entity1 is conducting " a wholesale re-examination " of soldiers whose post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis was reversed by the military hospital at @entity6 , @entity1 sec. @entity7 said wednesday at a @entity10 hearing			1
the review comes after revelations that a significant number of diagnosis had been reversed			2
statistics showed staff at @entity17 on @entity18 had reversed the ptsd diagnoses of 40 % of the troops they 'd evaluated , according to sen. @entity22 , @entity24 - @entity23 , who raised the issue at a hearing on @entity27			1
@entity18 is the home base of staff sgt. @entity29 , the soldier who is in custody for allegedly killing 16 @entity32 civilians earlier this month			1
there 's no evidence that @entity35 had been diagnosed or treated for ptsd or that his case had been reversed , though his attorney suggested tuesday that he would make @entity36 an issue in the case			1
" anybody that has seen what he 's seen and done what he 's done at the request of the military ... i think , would have ptsd			2
i do n't know , i 'm not an expert in that arena , " said his attorney @entity49			2
when that statistics came out , the @entity1 started investigating , @entity7 said			1
" clearly when you have those kinds of data we want to make sure that everything is appropriate , " @entity7 testified wednesday at a @entity55 hearing			0
he said the army surgeon general , lt. gen. @entity61 , immediately asked the unit at @entity18 that was evaluating ptsd cases to step down and the reversed diagnoses are being re-examined			2
in some cases , @entity36 findings have been reinstated , @entity7 said			0
gen. @entity61 is also investigating whether ptsd evaluations at other @entity1 medical facilities are being done properly			1
results of that investigation are not complete			0
some concerned soldiers said the @entity18 re-evaluation was based on the extraordinary cost of potential lifetime care for a soldier diagnosed with @entity36			0
@entity7 said that should not be a factor in such considerations " fiscal considerations are not in any way a part of the evaluation			0
it 's simply unacceptable , " @entity7 said			0
" we 're doing everything we can to make that clear system - side			0
