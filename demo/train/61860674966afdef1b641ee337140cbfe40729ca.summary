-- an intense typhoon made landfall in the southern @entity3 early tuesday amid fears that it could be worse than a 2011 storm that killed more than 1,200 people			1
@entity9 struck the southern island of @entity11 shortly before 4:45 a.m. ( 3:45 p.m. monday et ) , the @entity8 reported			1
the storm packed top winds of 175 kph ( 110 mph ) as it came ashore over the city of @entity18 , and millions of people -- many of whom live in remote and unprepared communities -- were in the storm 's path , @entity3 authorities and aid groups said			1
the tightly packed but powerful storm threatened to bring devastating flash floods and landslides			1
high winds could blast some homes into sticks , uproot trees and cut power for days , government officials warned			0
the storm weakened slightly as it moved west across @entity11 during the course of the morning , the @entity34 said			1
there were no immediate reports of casualties			0
the storm , dubbed " @entity42 " in the @entity3 , had blown up into a super typhoon at one point monday , with sustained winds greater than 240 kph -- the equivalent of a category 5 hurricane in the @entity48 , the @entity40 reported			1
that wind speed is two and a half times the top winds of @entity51 , known in the @entity3 as @entity51 , whose heavy rains set off landslides that swept away entire villages in the same region a year ago			1
" many emotional people in ( @entity11 ) trying to prepare for @entity42 with @entity51 fresh in their minds , " @entity57 , the @entity3 director for the children 's charity @entity58 , wrote monday on @entity60			1
in the fishing village of @entity65 , officials had warned coastal and island residents to evacuate to government shelters in the final hours before the storm hit , @entity0 affiliate @entity71 reported			1
at sea near the storm , waves reached as high as 52 feet , according to the @entity40			0
on land , the outer bands of the storm had already begun to bring intense rain and high winds to coastal communities before landfall was made , according to the @entity82			0
government agencies had moved millions of dollars worth of relief supplies into position for quick delivery to storm - hit regions and put emergency crews , the military and hospitals on standby			2
school classes were suspended in many cities , and at least 80 flights were canceled , according to the disaster agency			0
the threat to @entity11 comes just weeks ahead of the first anniversary of @entity51 , whose heavy rains set off flash floods in the middle of the night that swept away entire villages			1
more than 1,200 people died and hundreds of thousands were left homeless , prompting a humanitarian crisis			2
stormy weather in recent months also has caused death and destruction in other areas of the @entity3 , where poor infrastructure leaves many communities highly vulnerable			2
severe flooding in the region of the capital , @entity113 , killed more than 80 people in august			2
and @entity115 left at least 27 people dead after sweeping across the central @entity3 in october			2
@entity117 , a tiny island nation roughly 1,000 kilometers ( 600 miles ) east of @entity11 , had a close shave with @entity9 as the typhoon churned past , catching some outlying parts of the archipelago			1
" it was headed right toward @entity117 , " said @entity123 , a meteorologist for the @entity125 @entity124 in @entity126			0
but at the last minute , " it just turned to the west and fortunately went south of them , " he said			0
" i really think they escaped the brunt of the storm , " @entity123 said in an interview with the @entity132 , noting that @entity117 does n't usually get hit by strong typhoons			0
@entity9 nonetheless brought down a lot of trees and caused widespread power outages in @entity117 , according to @entity123			0
" the fast movement of the system really prevented a lot of flooding , " he said			0
" i think probably only a few inches of rain fell , so that 's certainly good news , because @entity117 itself is susceptible to mudslides			0
" @entity0 's @entity150 reported from @entity151 and @entity0 's @entity152 reported from @entity153 .			0
