-- coming back this weekend after a stay in @entity3 , i had that distinct sensation -- last felt when @entity5 capsized , setting off the @entity6 -- that we once again find ourselves at the mercy of events and people just beyond our control			2
here at home , one hears that by wednesday dawn , we will know whether @entity15 's latest big try to stop the oil spill will work			1
if it does , we can begin to feel that we are moving in the right direction , but if it does n't -- well , no one is quite sure what @entity21 looks like			2
is this really where we have come : that the fate of our precious coastlines and the waters off our coasts are in the hands of a single foreign - based company ? a month ago , it looked like the @entity32 was on top of this problem , as @entity36 officers scurried here and there , the @entity39 and others swung into action , there were talks with @entity15 , and the president paid a personal visit			1
but increasingly , it has become apparent that the federal government may be present but is not in charge			2
it keeps saying that @entity15 bears ultimate responsibility			0
it is keeping the press away			0
no wonder @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 exploded late last week			0
they are right on a basic point : ultimately it is not the responsibility of @entity15 or any other company to protect @entity63 interests but the responsibility of the federal government			1
some @entity67 supporters have argued that the 1990 @entity68 limits the president 's capacity to take action			0
either way , in an emergency , laws can be changed			0
although this disaster is not an existential threat , it could be argued that if the @entity63 government had fought @entity81 in the same way it has fought the oil spill , we might well be speaking @entity84 now			1
faced with a growing danger to our well - being , a @entity81 - type government would at minimum have : brought in the @entity89 of all the major oil companies and charged them with the duty of an all - hands collaborative effort to stop the spill and help ward off the damage			1
brought in the best minds in the country , from universities and technology , for emergency efforts to find solutions			0
moved quickly to mobilize the @entity102 and other military forces , if necessary , ensuring that they received the resources needed to protect our beaches			2
made a clear call to citizen volunteers to help where necessary			0
given @entity36 officers an ultimatum : get this under control in the next 30 days , or else			0
there will be ample time after this disaster for finger - pointing and blame - laying			0
the key now is to get this spill under control before it does far more damage			2
meanwhile , the @entity122 had it exactly right monday morning when it argued that with the @entity3 crisis spreading now beyond @entity133 , " the knife - edge psychology currently governing global markets has put the future of the @entity63 economic recovery in the hands of politicians in an assortment of @entity3 capitals			1
" across @entity3 , one finds people stunned at the rapidity with which this crisis has grown , threatening not only their weak economies but also their dreams of a @entity3 utopia with people living a honeyed existence			0
all that could go smash now			0
indeed , it is ironic that @entity3 may now be forced to give up its strong welfare state even as the @entity63 is moving toward it			1
but the immediate point is that the @entity63 finds itself too much at the mercy of whether @entity3 politicians and publics now make the right moves			1
it may take a while , but @entity63 are going to start feeling a lot happier about our country when we once again believe we have strong control of own destiny			1
leadership , anyone ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity162 .			1

@entity162 : growing concern that government is not *responding* *adequately* to oil spill
he says it does n't make sense that fate of @entity63 coast is in hands of one company
determined government response would have mobilized more resources , he says
