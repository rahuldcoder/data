-- " do the right thing ; do n't be evil honesty and integrity in all we do our business practices are beyond reproach we make money by doing good things " so goes the sixth point in @entity10 's official statement of core values years ago , often condensed to the informal company motto , " do n't be evil			1
" it 's supposed to make us feel better about trying new technologies from @entity16 notebooks to @entity17			1
do n't worry -- we 're not going to screw with you			2
so when it comes time someday to inject our brains with nanobots that give us the ability to speak new languages , we can rest assured that @entity10 wo n't change the user agreement on us after the fact and plant advertisements into our dreams while we 're asleep			1
that is , if the company judges such practices to be truly evil			2
well , some of @entity10 's recent forays are waking people up to the fact that evil is in the eyes of the beholder			1
the company just acquired military robot maker @entity38 , leading to great consternation in the @entity40			1
as @ @entity41 put it this week in a tweet that caught fire : truth be told , the robots @entity38 makes are pretty cool			1
based on animal physiology , they can run , jump , balance and even chase stuff			0
as something of a technogeek myself , i can see why a bunch of engineers would want to play with this technology			2
what we have to ask , and keep asking at every turn , is : to what end ? what real purpose are we serving ? not doing evil is actually a pretty low bar to begin with			2
is this really a high aspiration ? to avoid embodying @entity66 in silicon ? even if we accept avoiding evil as the mantra of the digital age , the presumption here is that evil is like a line of code that can simply be excluded from the overall program			2
oops ! line 45 of that app has some evil in it			2
we ca n't employ an entirely programmatic approach to human affairs			2
however well we think we might be embedding our technologies with the values we hope to express , more often than not we also get unexpected consequences			0
cars lead to pollution and oil to wars			0
smartphones lead to distraction and car accidents			0
big data leads to coercive marketing and government to massive surveillance			0
something awfully close to evil is quite a common side effect			2
@entity10 seems aware of this , at least from a public relations perspective			1
likely concerned about what it looks like for the company to be developing military hardware , the company recently donated $ 5 million to the @entity107 for drones to track down rhinoceros poachers in @entity110			1
it 's as if they 're out to prove that drones are not necessarily evil			1
still , we ca n't help but do a bit of evil when we build technology upon technology , without taking a pause to ask what it 's all for			1
new technologies give us the opportunity to reevaluate the systems we have been using up until now , and consider doing things differently			0
but the stock - market - fueled culture of @entity128 too often focuses on efficiency of execution rather than clarity of purpose			0
the result is that our best @entity135 computer science graduates end up writing algorithms that better extract money from the stock market , rather than exploring whether capital is even serving its original purpose of getting funds to new businesses			0
or the engineers behind @entity144 develop a brilliant new digital currency without evaluating the purpose of money in our society			0
the problem to be addressed is that too much cash has ended up stuck in the coffers of the speculators			0
instead of thinking about how to encourage peer - to - peer transaction , @entity144 's developers simply built another speculative currency , only this time on digital steroids			0
likewise , war is not a great approach to conflict resolution			0
adding robot soldiers to the mix merely improves the efficiency of killing			0
how might robots be used to reduce conflict instead of enact it ? when we develop technology in a vacuum , disconnected from the reality in which people really live , we are too likely to spend our energy designing some abstract vision of a future life rather than addressing the pains and injustices around us right now			1
technology becomes a way of escaping the world 's problems , whether through virtual reality or massive @entity128 stock options packages , rather than engaging with them			1
but the do n't - do - evil mandate does n't even ask @entity10 's programmers to evaluate the purpose of a technology -- only to perform a basic " checksum , " or error correction , for evil itself			1
this is not enough for a company that appears dedicated to uploading human consciousness to the cloud , no matter how many robot warriors we have protecting our virtual reality servers from the people we leave behind			1
i 'm not arguing against technology or that we do less with it			0
i 'm arguing we do more			0
it 's not enough to computerize and digitize the society we have , and exacerbate its problems by new means			0
we must transcend the mere avoidance of the patently evil and instead seek to do good			1
that may involve actually overturning and remaking some institutions and processes from the ground up			0
that 's the real potential of digital technology			1
to retrieve the values and ideas that may have seemed impossible before and see whether we can realize them today in this very new world			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			1

@entity10 recently acquired military robot maker @entity38
@entity224 : @entity228 is in the eyes of the beholder ; people *question* what @entity10 is up to
we get into trouble with new technology if we do n't pause to think what it 's for , he says
@entity224 : we must transcend the mere avoidance of " evil " and seek to do good
