@entity0 still remembers in vivid detail the day her island home was swallowed by a volcano as she and her family joined others fleeing the molten lava			1
" as my boat left the harbor , the fissure opened up , and flames burst into the sky , " she recalls			0
" the fissure extended into the ocean , and i could see red - hot lava beneath the water			0
" @entity0 was 18 in january 1973 when the @entity16 volcano exploded on @entity17 , a small island 151 kilometers ( 94 miles ) from the @entity20 capital , @entity21			1
her childhood home was among 400 buildings engulfed as 200 million tons of ash and lava rained down in the days following the eruption			0
some of these structures have now emerged , perfectly preserved beneath the volcanic debris following an archaeological excavation begun six years ago			2
worlds of fire the result is a captivating new museum , @entity34 , meaning " worlds of fire , " which opened its doors in may 2014			2
at the museum , visitors can revisit 1973 , see a snapshot of life on @entity17 and also get insight into the devastation wreaked by the volcano			1
on the fateful night , the island 's 5,300 residents were alerted to the eruption by the honking of fire engine horns			1
when they stepped outside their houses , they saw bright red lava exploding from @entity16 and a wall of fire spurting from a fissure snaking across the island			1
only one person died as a result of the eruption			0
the vast majority of the islanders were evacuated that night , not returning until months later			2
many of those living on the eastern side came back to find their houses engulfed by lava , while other properties had been completely flattened or buried under mountains of ash			1
a few islanders stayed away , but the majority rebuilt their houses closer to @entity69 , the 13 - square - kilometer ( five square miles ) island 's only town			1
@entity71 stands still when archaeologists began to excavate the houses nearest to the volcano in 2006 , they found that beneath the mountains of ash and frozen slabs of lava , time had stood still			1
prior to the eruption , tables had been laid for breakfast and clothes folded and piled by the fireplace , but everything had been abandoned when the fire engines started sounding their horns			0
archaeologists decided to focus on one particular cottage , which now forms the centerpiece of the @entity93 museum , located on the outskirts of @entity69			0
inside the museum 's walls , petrified waterfalls of ash pour from the cottage 's windows , through which lampshades , tablecloths and curtains can be seen			2
the mountains of ash visible from the museum 's windows are reminders of just how close this island came to total destruction			1
@entity17 , a 25 - minute plane ride from @entity21 or a 30 - minute ferry journey from @entity20 's mainland , is a barren chunk of volcanic rock			1
visitors who take the ferry arrive into a small harbor dramatically narrowed by a river of solidified lava			0
when @entity16 erupted , the lava flow almost cut the harbor off entirely			2
locals slowed its progress by spraying it with cold water , but not before it had increased the island 's size by one square mile			2
towering banks of ash the horizon here is dominated by two enormous volcanic peaks			0
@entity135 , a perfect , grass - covered cone , erupted thousands of years ago , spewing so much lava that two islands merged to form @entity17			2
@entity16 , meanwhile , is a jagged , ash - covered reminder of the 1973 eruption , although in places , bright purple lupins sprout from the blackened slopes where locals have planted grass to improve its appearance and prevent erosion			1
on boat rides around the island , visitors pass towering banks of ash sloping down to the sea			0
in places , the coastline has been imprinted with a semi-geometric pattern , as though someone has transplanted part of @entity160 's @entity159 here			0
a visit to @entity162 , a cafe in @entity69 run by @entity0 , offers fascinating insight into the events of 1973			1
@entity0 , who returned to @entity17 as a married woman two years after the eruption , opened the cafe as a memorial to the volcano			1
each table tells the story of a different family , with before and after photos and accounts of that fateful night			0
today @entity0 , like other islanders , says she 's simply grateful for the low death toll , and the fact that the island was n't destroyed entirely			1
" we 're just so thankful that we 've been allowed to continue living in such a beautiful place , " she explains			0
" we came so close to this island being uninhabitable			0
