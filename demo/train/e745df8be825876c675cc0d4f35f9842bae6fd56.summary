@entity0 -- two inmates testified saturday that @entity3 , the @entity4 student convicted of murder in @entity6 , was not actually involved in the killing of her roommate			1
but they offered two different accounts on who the actual killers were			2
three other inmates testified as well			1
@entity13 was sentenced last year to 26 years in prison for the death of @entity16 at a house the two shared in @entity19 , the central @entity6 town where both were students			1
@entity13 has vehemently proclaimed her innocence and her family has continued to fight the conviction			1
two hours of legal wrangling between attorneys passed before the judge decided to allow inmates @entity28 and @entity30 to testify			1
@entity28 is serving a life sentence for kidnapping and killing an 18 - month - old boy			1
@entity28 testified that @entity16 , who has also been convicted in @entity36 's murder and is serving a 16 - year sentence , told him that neither @entity13 nor her @entity6 boyfriend at the time , @entity38 , were involved in the killing			1
later in the day , @entity30 , who has ties to the @entity41 , testified that it was his brother who was the killer , together with an @entity46 man			1
according to @entity28 , @entity47 said that he and an unnamed friend visited @entity36 to try to get her to participate in sexual acts			2
when @entity36 denied them , @entity47 's friend forced himself on her , and @entity47 also participated , @entity28 said			2
at one point , the friend pulled out a knife , and then @entity47 , who was holding @entity36 at the time , noticed she had started bleeding , @entity28 testified			2
@entity28 told the court that @entity47 tried to stop the bleeding , but that his friend urged him to leave			0
" we need to finish her otherwise she will tell on us , " @entity28 quoted the friend as telling @entity47			0
the friend then proceeded to inflict another wound on her , @entity28 testified			2
@entity28 said @entity47 remained by himself with @entity36 for a while , but eventually left her injured			0
prosecutors and the lawyer for @entity36 's family questioned the validity of @entity28 's testimony			0
through his lawyers , @entity47 denied @entity28 's version of events			0
during his testimony , @entity30 gave a different account			0
@entity30 said that on the night of the killing , his brother came home with scratches and other wounds			2
as @entity30 tended to the wounds , his brother confessed to him that he had killed @entity36 , he said			0
according to @entity30 , his brother said that he and an @entity46 man entered the residence to steal a painting , and in the act ended up killing the girl			2
@entity30 said he has n't seen his brother in three years			0
" inside me i know that a miscarriage of justice has taken place , " @entity30 said of @entity13 and @entity38 's conviction			1
prosecutors questioned his credibility and @entity30 admitted that he has been convicted of defamation seven times			2
the appeals process will continue june 27 , when @entity47 is expected to testify			0
in an additional twist saturday , another inmate who the defense put on the stand to verify @entity28 's version of events , testified that he , in fact , did not know anything about who carried out the killings			1
even though his cell was adjacent to @entity28 's and @entity47 's , the inmate was @entity107 and did n't know what they discussed , he said			0
another witness saturday was @entity111 , a @entity41 member who testified from behind a screen because he is a protected witness			1
@entity111 said that he also heard from @entity47 that @entity13 had nothing to do with the crime			1
@entity36 , 21 , was found dead on november 2 , 2007 , seminaked with her throat slashed			0
@entity13 and @entity38 were both found guilty of the murder			1
@entity13 was sentenced in december 2009			1
@entity47 , a drifter originally from @entity117 , was tried separately			0
as part of her appeal , forensic experts are retesting evidence that was used to convict @entity13			1
that evidence includes a knife found in @entity38 's apartment with @entity13 's dna on the handle and what @entity19 prosecutors say is @entity36 's dna in a tiny groove on the blade			1
the prosecution contends that the knife was used to stab @entity36 in the neck and that it had been cleaned			0
the dna matter attributed to @entity36 consists of flesh , not blood , they say			0
the sample , however , was so small that forensic scientists investigating @entity36 's murder were not able to double - test it in accordance with international forensic science norms , which @entity13 's legal team says raises doubts about its validity			1
the second piece of evidence the forensic experts are testing is the tiny metal clasp from @entity36 's bra , which was cut from her body after her slaying			0
forensic scientists in the investigatory phase determined that @entity38 's dna is present on the metal clasp			0
the clasp was identified on an investigatory video the same day @entity36 's body was found			0
but it was not collected until nearly six weeks later , giving the defense cause to question whether the sample may have been contaminated .			0
