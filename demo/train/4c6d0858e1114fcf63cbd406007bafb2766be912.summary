-- when @entity3 monarch , @entity2 , founded @entity4 in the late 18th century , he bestowed upon the bustling waterway that ran through his new capital a title fit for royalty -- " @entity9 " ( the @entity10 )			1
settlers to the city built their homes along the river 's banks , its waters providing the maritime access essential for commerce as well as the fish to feed a growing population			2
today , @entity9 remains a busy thoroughfare			0
the living space that has built up aside its shores however is vastly different			0

it is here that " @entity34 " -- an aptly named tower of condominiums and luxury living space -- soars above the bustling waters and streets below			1
at 256 meters ( 840 feet ) tall , the giant structure is 6 meters ( 19 feet ) taller than @entity9 is wide , making it the tallest residential building in @entity3			1
for @entity40 , the @entity3 - @entity41 design consultant behind the project , @entity34 is a potent symbol of modern @entity4 -- a vibrant metropolis that can offer spectacular accommodation at cheaper rate than other big @entity48 cities			1
@entity50 gardens and quiet pools in the facility grounds maintain the feel of an urban oasis amidst the surrounding concrete jungle			0
" living on the river affords you the ability to have a space like this which could be a resort if you did not have this poster which is the city of @entity4 , " @entity40 explained			1
" it has that 5 star feel			0
" a new track a key component of @entity4 's riverside regeneration and the rise of facilities like @entity34 has been improved transport links , @entity40 explained			1
@entity73 boat services frequently cross @entity9 while the city 's skytrain ( known locally as the @entity76 ) has provided faster access to areas that were once considered too out of the way and poorly connected			1

" today the @entity76 comes across and goes all the way into west ( of the ) country			0
" while the skytrain has ensured properties like @entity34 are viable and desirable , it has also had a knock - on impact on the areas it passes through			1
those who live in its shadows have seen their property values soar			0
" i could earn something already ( by selling ) , " explained said @entity100 , standing outside the humble shop - house that has been in his family 's possession for generations			2
" whatever my father left for me i should do my best to keep it for ( his ) legacy , " he added			0
developers ' paradise for developers , meanwhile , a relaxation of planning laws ( restrictions on how high they can build have been set aside ) has incentivized the construction of quality accommodation in areas like those which host the @entity122 abode			0
" the regulations limit what you can do in various places so at the time this site came up it was an opportunity to do something big , " said @entity123 , who oversees @entity34 for developer @entity124			2
although roughly 10 % of apartments remain without owners ( primarily those not overlooking the water ) , there is a strong financial incentive for developers to invest in @entity4			2
as @entity123 illustrates , the average cost per unit was $ 3,400 a square meter in 2007			0
today they go for $ 4,700 , with penthouses selling for three times that amount			0
" the prices that we are asking for here maybe in the higher end of the @entity4 market but by comparison with @entity154 or @entity155 we are very ( affordable ) , " @entity147 said			2
in fact , this equates to just a fifth of the price of luxury property in @entity154			0
while such sums still represent a considerable outlay , @entity123 's hope is that potential investors will be encouraged to snap up the remaining properties and become part of the next chapter of @entity4 's famous river .			1

at 256 meters tall , " @entity34 " is @entity3 's tallest residential tower
the luxury development has helped regenerate some of @entity4 's most neglected areas
a key component of " @entity34 's " *success* has been the development of new transport links
