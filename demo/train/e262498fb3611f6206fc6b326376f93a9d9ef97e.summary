-- on the sweltering evening of april 12 , 2009 , as dusk deepened over the @entity3 , several hundred miles off the coast of @entity5 , three shots rang out			2
all the bullets found their targets -- three @entity5 pirates in a small lifeboat bobbing on the darkening sea			2
for the past five days the pirates had taken hostage @entity12 , the @entity14 captain of the @entity16 container ship			1
president @entity17 had authorized the use of deadly force if @entity12 ' life was in danger			1
unbeknownst to the pirates , days earlier a contingent from @entity23 had parachuted at night into the ocean near the @entity27 warship , which was shadowing the pirates in their boat			2
the @entity30 had taken up position on the fantail of the @entity27 and were carefully monitoring @entity12 while he was in the custody of the pirates			2
one of the pirates had just pointed his @entity36 at the @entity14 captain as if he were going to shoot him			1
that 's when the seal team commander on the @entity27 ordered his men to take out the pirates			1
@entity14 terror raids : 2 operations			1
5 questions three @entity30 sharpshooters fired simultaneously at the pirates from a distance of 30 yards in heaving seas at nightfall , killing them all			2
@entity17 called vice adm. @entity51 , the leader of @entity52 and of the mission to rescue @entity12 , to tell him , " great job			1
" in the eyes of @entity57 at least , the @entity14 public ca n't get enough of these kinds of operations			1
" @entity61 , " a movie starring @entity63 playing the rescued sea captain , will be in theaters on friday			2
the flawless rescue of @entity66 was the first time that @entity17 , only three months into his new job , was personally exposed to the capabilities of @entity72 's " @entity71 , " as they sometimes refer to themselves			1
they are the secretive counterterrorism units of special operations , made up of units including the @entity78 's @entity23 and the @entity80 's @entity79 , whose well - oiled skills @entity17 has come to rely upon increasingly with every passing year of his presidency			1
@entity84 raids this was underlined over the weekend in @entity84 when operators from @entity79 and @entity23 carried out raids in @entity88 and @entity5 -- more than 2,000 miles apart -- targeting a longtime alleged member of @entity91 in the @entity88 capital , @entity93 , and the leaders of one @entity91 's affiliated groups in the @entity5 port of @entity97			1
in @entity93 , @entity79 operators seized @entity98 , who is wanted for his alleged role performing surveillance on the @entity14 embassy in @entity102 , @entity103 , which was destroyed by an @entity91 truck bomb in 1998 , while in @entity106 6 operators went ashore to attack a house frequented by commanders of @entity109 , the group that launched the attack on the mall in @entity102 two weeks ago where at least 67 people were killed			1
the @entity79 raid in @entity93 went off flawlessly , but the @entity30 encountered heavy resistance in @entity97 and the seal team retreated			0
details of what exactly happened during the @entity5 operation are still murky			0
the two raids over the weekend show that president @entity17 remains very comfortable deploying special operations forces in countries the @entity14 is not at war with as a means to combat terrorist groups , just as he is comfortable with the use of @entity129 drones for the same purpose in countries such as @entity132 and @entity133			1
for the @entity138 , part of the appeal of special operations and drones is that they do not , of course , consume anything like the blood and treasure that are expended on conventional military operations such as the wars in @entity145 and @entity146			1
indeed , the @entity30 have had considerable experience working in and around @entity5 in recent years			0
six months after the rescue of @entity12 , @entity17 's national security team authorized a mission to take out @entity151 , a leader of @entity91 in @entity84			1
@entity151 was killed by @entity23 in a helicopter raid on september 14 , 2009 , as he was driving south of the @entity5 capital , @entity154			2
the @entity30 landed briefly to take @entity151 's body , and after they had confirmed his identity through dna samples , he was buried at sea			2
@entity14 official : raid 's target was @entity109 foreign fighter commander home of @entity23 it is quite challenging to enter the @entity30 , but an even greater challenge is to be selected for the @entity30 's premier counterterrorism force , the innocuously named @entity23 based at @entity167 , @entity168 , near the bustling resort town of @entity170			1
it 's known inside the military as " @entity23 " and more popularly as " @entity23 " and is an elite within the @entity30 elite			2
the men of @entity23 , around 250 in total , are battle - hardened and are usually in their mid- 30s			0
@entity23 is divided into squadrons that are named by color : @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 are the assault squadrons , @entity182 handles vehicles and boats , and @entity185 is the sniper team			0
these squadrons scout other seal teams , which number around 2,000 men , for those with the particular skills they need			0
@entity23 's base at @entity167 does not announce itself			0
behind the high wire fence that seals the @entity30 off from the rest of the world is a large dog pound where the highly trained dogs that accompany the men on their missions live			0
there is a giant wall to sharpen climbing skills and a hangar full of exceptionally fast boats			0
other hangars house experimental @entity208 - like dune buggies suitable for driving in the deserts of the @entity210 and weapons rooms loaded with exotic firearms			0
' @entity5 - ized ' @entity23 's greatest coup , of course , was the 2011 operation in @entity216 , @entity132 , in which @entity217 was killed			0
however , @entity23 's integral role in the war against @entity91 and its allies would not have been easy to predict before the 9/11 attacks			1
just recall the debacle that has come to be known as " @entity223			1
" in @entity154 , @entity5 , in early october 1993 a daytime helicopter assault -- by pilots of the @entity226 and elements of @entity23 , @entity79 and the 75th @entity228 -- to snatch @entity5 clan leaders who were attacking @entity14 troops stationed in @entity5 turned into a fiasco in which two @entity233 helicopters were shot down by rocket propelled grenades			1
scarred by @entity154 , the @entity236 was resistant to using @entity23 and @entity79 to take on @entity91 in @entity146 once the terrorist group had rebased itself there in 1996			0
indeed , after the 9/11 attacks , then - secretary of defense @entity238 was deeply frustrated that the first @entity14 boots on the ground in @entity146 were from the @entity129 and not the highly trained counterterrorism units of @entity23 and @entity79			1
on october 17 , 2001 , ten days after the @entity14 campaign against the @entity243 had started , @entity238 wrote a secret memo to gen. @entity245 , then - chairman of the @entity246 , expressing his irritation : " does the fact that the @entity249 ca n't do anything on the ground in @entity146 until @entity129 people go in first to prepare the way suggest that the @entity249 is lacking a capability we need ? specifically , given the nature of our world , is n't it conceivable that the @entity259 ) ought not to be in a position of near total dependence on @entity129 in situations such as this ? " officials working for @entity238 commissioned @entity265 , an historian on special forces , to find out why special operations units were not deployed to hit @entity91 before the attacks on @entity269 and @entity270			1
after all , fighting terrorists was why these units were founded in the first place			0
@entity274 concluded that in the years before 9/11 the senior officers at the @entity236 had become " @entity5 - ized			0
" then - special operations boss gen. @entity276 recalled , " special operations were never given the mission			1
it was very , very frustrating			0
it was like having a brand - new @entity281 in the garage and nobody wants to race it because you might dent the fender			0
" the attacks on the @entity287 and @entity236 allowed @entity238 to push special operations to the center of the " @entity290			1
" and on september 6 , 2003 , @entity238 signed an order known as an " @entity292 " that empowered @entity52 to hunt @entity91 in as many as 15 countries			0
wife : captured ' most wanted terrorist ' @entity295 had left @entity91 military 's own army in the decade after 9/11 , @entity52 became a small army within the military with its own drones , its own air force ( known as the @entity303 ) and its own intelligence operations			1
the rise of @entity52 was inextricably linked to the vision of maj. gen. @entity307 , a brilliant workaholic from a military family who was beloved by his men ; during the @entity312 he who would go out with them on missions to capture / kill insurgents			0
it was @entity307 who took the special operations @entity281 out of the garage and drove it to become a killing machine of unprecedented agility and ferocity			1
@entity52 went from mounting half a dozen operations a month in @entity145 in the spring of 2004 to 300 a month by the summer of 2006			0
it was @entity307 's five - year command of @entity52 between 2003 and 2008 that helped turn its core components of @entity23 and @entity79 into what is arguably the most agile and deadly force in history			0
one of the key officers under @entity307 was @entity51 , who took over command from @entity307 as head of @entity52 when @entity307 went to take a senior job at the @entity236			0
@entity336 is a strapping , dark - haired , blue - eyed @entity338 in his mid- 50s			0
in conversation as he chugs a rip it -- a heavily caffeinated beverage popular with @entity14 soldiers in @entity146 -- he speaks in well thought - out paragraphs , but he also peppers his speech with the occasional " doggone , " as well as other , more robust swear words			1
a battle - hardened colleague says @entity51 reminds him of the comic book superhero @entity72 , while another says he " is reputed to be the smartest seal that ever lived			0
he is physically tough , compassionate and can drive a knife through your ribs in a nanosecond			0
" even as a three - star admiral , about once a month in @entity146 , @entity51 went out with his teams on snatch - and - grab missions			0
it was @entity51 who planned the @entity217 raid down to the last details			0
now he commands @entity52 , or @entity361 , which oversees special operations by the @entity78 , @entity80 , @entity303 and @entity363			2
according to its mission statement , @entity361 's job is to " synchronize planning of global operations against terrorist networks			2
" a sign of where the @entity17 administration is placing its bets about what it believes to be the future of warfare is that while there are major cuts planned for all four of the armed services , @entity361 is one of the few places in the military where the force is actually growing .			2

@entity383 : after ' @entity223 ' *disaster* , @entity14 stopped relying on special forces
he says 9/11 led to *renewed* *interest* in using seals , other special forces
@entity392 : weekend 's operations show @entity17 's continued support for special forces
2009 rescue of @entity14 *merchant* captain from pirates *impressed* @entity17 , he says
