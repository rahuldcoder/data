@entity0 -- @entity3 @entity2 began enforcing a ban monday on camping in two @entity0 parks , with occupy protesters at one site defiantly huddling under a large blue tarp that they dubbed the " tent of dreams			1
" no one had been arrested as of early monday afternoon at @entity13 or @entity14 , @entity2 spokesman sgt. @entity11 said at an impromptu news conference frequently interrupted by protesters			2
but some protesters had voluntarily agreed to remove sleeping bags , pillows and housekeeping supplies , he said			2
on friday , the @entity21 set a noon monday deadline for protesters who have occupied the parks for months to remove their camping gear			2
park officials said protesters would be allowed to remain around the clock and keep up tents , so long as one side of each tent remains open at all times , officials said			1
@entity35 resident @entity34 filed a complaint and motion for a temporary restraining order in @entity39 in @entity0 on monday claiming that " the term ' camping ' is defined over-broadly			1
" acting as his own attorney , he argued that sleeping in the park " is unavoidable for destitute participants in a long - term political assembly , " adding that calling it camping " implicitly and wrongly ( suggests ) that the behavior is somehow trivial , frivolous or optional			1
" " this is not about ' camping , ' " @entity34 wrote			0
" it is about preserving political discourse , a good more sacred than any warrior 's statue , and infinitely more fragile than the park 's @entity54			0
" the threat of arrest did n't deter many in the @entity59 movement			1
on its official @entity62 feed , the group claimed monday evening that 50 to 75 protesters were on site -- including a " bunch of new occupiers			1
" " i 'm going to do the best i can to stay here , " said @entity67 , who has been staying at the @entity13 camp			0
" if they want to arrest me , they can			0
" @entity72 said many fellow protesters have removed prohibited gear from @entity13 , but others have moved in and deliberately set up camp to challenge police			1
as monday 's noon deadline passed , protesters pulled the tarp over a statue of the park 's namesake , @entity85 gen. @entity84 , to create what they called a " tent of dreams			2
" " let us sleep so we can dream , " they chanted			0
protesters have been camping in @entity13 since october to rally against what they consider to be corporate greed and financial abuses			2
protesters " glitter - bomb " senator outside @entity0 gala @entity59 said in a statement posted on its website sunday that members " will defend the public space we have used as our center for activism , " calling possible arrests of protesters a " politically motivated attempt to suppress the free speech of the disenfranchised 99 %			1
" pastor @entity108 of @entity0 's @entity109 said area churches have discussed helping house some of the protesters overnight so that they could continue a 24 - hour vigil if park police began enforcing the rules against overnight encampments			1
whatever happens with the camps and police , @entity117 said it would not alter her and fellow demonstrators ' commitment to their cause or their activism			2
" the park and the occupation of the park is a tactic			0
it 's not the movement , " she said , calling the camps " a really important symbolic statement			0
" " if we ca n't sleep here , that does not end the movement , " @entity117 said			0
one man was arrested sunday after he allegedly went from tent to tent , removing notices from the @entity21			0
a video posted online showed the man walking away from police as officers tried to grab him			1
one officer used a taser on the man , who fell to the ground and was handcuffed			0
@entity11 said monday that the incident was under review			0
the @entity151 's website indicated that more than 15,000 people had signed an online petition criticizing the incident and calling on the @entity21 to " stop buckling to political pressure and to respect free speech on federal land			0
" @entity159 spokesman @entity158 mentioned the general situation unfolding at the two parks , both blocks from the @entity159 , in his daily press briefing monday			0
" our position has been and continues to be that we need to balance @entity167 concerns of the right to demonstrate , the right to speak freely , with public safety concerns and public health concerns , " he said			0
" and we understand that local law enforcement as well as , in this case , the @entity21 and @entity173 are weighing those considerations when they make these decisions			0
" until now , occupy protesters have been allowed to remain under a @entity21 interpretation that considered the activity a " 24 - hour vigil			1
" two weeks ago , @entity21 director @entity182 said he saw no reason to move against the encampments			0
" i think if there 's any place in this country , @entity0 , is the place where we need to be the most tolerant of individuals that are exercising their @entity167 activities , " he said			1
@entity194 @entity193 rep. @entity193 disagreed , saying @entity182 was " completely out of line			1
" " it is not his job to interpret the @entity198 over law , " @entity193 said			0
@entity193 , who last month wrote a letter to @entity201 interior secretary @entity201 citing damage to part of a $ 400,000 renovation of @entity13 , continued his criticism at a @entity159 hearing last week and came away unsatisfied with the @entity21 's answers			0
@entity59 is part of a larger activist surge that began last year in @entity209 and quickly spread			1
while the protesters have highlighted a number of causes , the overarching theme has remained largely the same : populist anger over what activists portray as an out - of - touch corporate , financial and political elite			1
occupy protesters in the nation 's capital are n't the only ones who have found themselves at odds with authorities in recent days			2
violent clashes , for instance , erupted last weekend in @entity228 , @entity194			1
protesters trying to take - over a vacant convention center threw rocks , bottles and other objects saturday afternoon at police , who responded with bean - bag rounds , tear gas and smoke grenades			1
afterward , the activists criticized police as being heavy - handed , with police and city officials said the protesters instigated the violence			1
the @entity228 demonstrators later got into a downtown @entity247 and , eventually , @entity248			2
once there , police said that protesters painted graffiti on walls , took down and burned an @entity3 flag and committed other acts of vandalism			2
@entity228 police chief @entity257 later said about 400 demonstrators were arrested			1
he said three police officers and two protesters were confirmed injured , though the @entity263 forces on @entity62 claimed that many more members of their ranks got hurt			2
@entity248 reopened monday after an extensive clean - up effort			0
also on monday , protesters in @entity269 , @entity270 , were given an afternoon deadline to remove tents from the site of the old city hall , @entity1 affiliate @entity267 reported			1
afternoon video from the scene showed police taking down and carrying off several tents , and at least one protester was seen being carried away by authorities			1
" we 're doing the right thing , peacefully and quietly , " protester @entity281 told @entity267			0
" we 're expressing ourselves in a better way than anyone else would			0
" @entity1 's @entity286 , @entity287 , @entity288 , @entity289 , @entity290 , @entity291 and @entity292 contributed to this report .			0
