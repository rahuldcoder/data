could you imagine a presidential election where two hopeful candidates had their campaigns run by the same communications firm ? welcome to the world of football where two men hoping to become the leader of @entity10 , football 's world governing body , are using the same campaign company despite ostensibly being in opposition			1
@entity15 , the former @entity17 and @entity18 midfielder and @entity20 's prince @entity19 have engaged @entity22 - based @entity21 to help land them the top job			1
a public relations company with great experience in sport , @entity25 also has a wider communications brief working with @entity30 , the @entity31 confederation within @entity10			1
meaning truth in @entity33 , @entity25 has enjoyed great success helping @entity35 win the hosting bid for the @entity37 , running @entity39 's successful presidential bid for the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) and working with the city of @entity42 during the @entity37 in @entity43			0
now it is set to play a key role in the presidential election -- by representing two of the candidates			1
both men along with @entity51 @entity50 are hoping to bring an end to the 17 - year reign of @entity54 , who at the age of 78 is aiming for a fifth consecutive term in office			1
but why are @entity15 , one of the finest players of his generation and @entity19 , the @entity20 prince who sits on the @entity61 , both using @entity62 to promote their campaigns ? responding to questions from @entity1 , @entity25 confirmed it was working on both campaigns			1
" @entity25 is proud to be providing prince @entity19 with strategic campaign and media relations support , " said the statement			1
" we also offer communications support , via the @entity73 , to @entity15 's campaign , and that includes his press conference in @entity22 this week			1
" @entity25 also has an ongoing contract with @entity30 , advising on a range of strategic communications matters			0
" we share a common commitment with all three reforming candidates and @entity30 to bring about positive change at @entity10			1
" @entity10 did not immediately respond to @entity1 's questions as to whether @entity54 was using a pr firm and how he was funding his re-election campaign @entity30 does not appear to have a problem with both the campaigns of prince @entity19 and @entity15 being run by the same company with the organization preferring to support a change of direction within @entity10 rather than back one specific candidate			1
rather than consider the two men opponents , the @entity31 governing body is believed to see the emergence of both prince @entity19 and @entity15 as two men who are sharing the common goal of reforming @entity10 and providing open and democratic debate			1
in a statement , @entity30 told @entity1 : " @entity30 appointed @entity21 as a consultant in march of 2014 to help support and develop its international communications activities			0
" as part of the contract with @entity30 , @entity25 deals with various matters concerning @entity31 and global football			0
" while @entity50 's campaign is being run separately , all three candidates are expected to meet ahead of the election			2
@entity30 president @entity110 has been outspoken in his desire to see change at the top of world football and wants @entity54 removed from the top job when the election takes place on may 29			1
he is likely to hold talks with the candidates a month or so before the election to see whether they have received enough support from the 209 national associations			2
it is thought that at least one of the three might pull out before the contest and instead pledge his votes to the candidate with the best chance of defeating @entity54			2
while @entity10 's image has been tarnished by numerous scandals under @entity54 's leadership , the @entity130 remains favorite to retain his position			1
the resignation of ethics investigator @entity136 over the organization 's handling of its own report into alleged corruption surrounding the @entity142 bids brought great embarrassment			0
but @entity54 's presidential rivals appear to have their work cut out to unseat the incumbent given the bedrock of support he enjoys , particularly in @entity149			1
" @entity54 has been very key for the development of the game in @entity149 , " @entity150 , head of the @entity152 @entity151 told @entity1			2
" there 's no fear			0
there are 54 countries -- i 'm not going to say 100 % that it 's a secret ballot , it 's not an open ballot , but everybody i 've spoken to is in one direction			0
" you need to decide that this man is an @entity149 , he feels @entity149 , he has supported @entity149 , and i will give him that support			0
" all four presidential candidates will be traveling to meet associations and hold talks over the election in the next couple of months			2
in an exclusive interview with @entity1 last month where he announced his intention to stand for president , @entity15 spoke of the need for change at the top of world football			2
the 42 - year - old , who made 127 international appearances for @entity182 , is admired by his fellow professionals and those who work within the game			0
" i can say i 'm a real candidate after today and i 'm looking forward to opening the debate and trying to get the support of many federations to have the chance to be the president , " added @entity15			2
" i think to [ take ] this step you have to be prepared			0
of course i did my homework but i have a lot of things that i have to learn , to improve , but if your mind is open i think it 's much more easy			0
" i have my ideas about what is football and what is good for improving @entity10 but i think my experience of my career is a positive thing that allows me to understand a lot of the game			0
my first priority is to know from the federations what they need			0
" i think one important thing is to increase the solidarity payments to the federations , because right now @entity10 has so many financial reserves that belong to the federations			0
" prince @entity19 , who spoke exclusively to @entity1 earlier this month , said he would leave @entity10 altogether if @entity54 won re-election			1
" i think the main point is to have a new culture " @entity19 told @entity1 in an interview after he addressed the media for the first time since announcing his intention to run			2
" it 's about not having the game controlled by people 's personal opinions or the whims of the president			0
it needs to be inclusive for all			0
" " i 've tried as much as i can to reform it from within ... having seen what 's happened i 'm not going to allow another four years of this , " prince @entity19 added while talking about @entity10 's internal workings .			1
