-- by now , you likely know @entity2 , who won an @entity3 on sunday for best original screenplay for " @entity5 , " was a stutterer just like @entity7 , whose battle with the speech disorder is portrayed in the film			1
what you might not know is that @entity2 , 73 , suffered from cancer , just like the king did			1
but unlike his majesty , @entity2 survived the cancer , and he says he did so because he used the same vivid imagination he employed to write his award - winning script			1
@entity2 says he visualized his cancer away			1
" i know it sounds awfully @entity22 and woo - woo , " he admits when he describes the visualization techniques he used when his bladder cancer was diagnosed nearly six years ago			1
" but that 's what happened			0
" @entity2 says when he found out his cancer had returned , he visualized a " lovely , clean healthy bladder " for two weeks , and the cancer disappeared			1
he 's been cancer - free for more than five years			1
whether you can imagine away cancer , or any other disease , has been hotly debated for years			1
one camp of doctors will tell you that they 've seen patients do it , and that a whole host of studies supports the mind - body connection			1
other doctors , just as well - respected , will tell you the notion is preposterous , and there 's not a single study to prove it really works			2
@entity2 is n't concerned about studies			1
he says all he knows is that for him , visualization worked			2
" @entity50 and salty tears " " when i was first diagnosed in 2005 , i was rather upset , of course , " @entity2 says in a telephone interview from his home in @entity53 , @entity22			1
" after three to four days of producing a lot of mucus and salty tears , i knew prolonged grief was bad for the autoimmune system , and the autoimmune system was the only buddy i had in fighting cancer			2
" @entity2 said that 's when he decided to sit down and write the screenplay for " @entity5 , " which had been simmering in his brain for many years			1
" i thought , if i throw myself into the creative process , i ca n't be sitting around feeling sorry for myself , " he says			0
after consulting with @entity22 urologist dr. @entity67 , @entity2 decided not to have chemotherapy or have all or part of his bladder removed , common treatments for bladder cancer			1
instead , he opted for surgery to remove just the cancer itself , and he took supplements meant to enhance his immune system			1
" for years , whenever i walked down the stairs i rattled like a pair of maracas , i had so many pills in me , " he says			0
despite his best efforts , the cancer came back within months			2
@entity2 was forced to rethink his decision not to have chemotherapy or bladder surgery			1
envisioning " a nice , cream - colored unblemished bladder " as his doctor booked an appointment for surgery two weeks later , @entity2 commiserated with his soon - to - be - ex - wife , and it was a comment from her that gave him the idea to try to visualize his cancer disappearing			1
" she said , ' well , what happens if in two weeks they go in and there 's no cancer ? ' " he remembers			2
" i thought to myself that 's the dumbest thing i 've ever heard			0
this woman 's in total denial			0
" but later , reflecting upon her comments , @entity2 thought perhaps she might be on to something -- perhaps it would be possible for his cancer to just disappear while he waited for surgery			1
figuring he had nothing to lose , for the next two weeks he imagined a clean bladder			2
" i spent hours visualizing a nice , cream - colored unblemished bladder lining , and then i went in for the operation , and a week later the doctor called me and his voice was very strange , " @entity2 remembers			1
" he said , ' i do n't know how to explain it , but there 's no cancer there			2
' he says the doctor was so confounded he sent the tissue from the presurgical biopsy to four different labs , and all confirmed they were cancerous			0
@entity2 says the doctor could n't explain how it had happened			1
he says he believes the supplements and visualizations were behind what his doctor called a " spontaneous remission " -- plus a change in his way of thinking			2
he stopped feeling sorry for himself because of his cancer and his impending divorce			2
" i was very grief - stricken , " he remembers			2
" it was a 30 - year marriage , and in my grief , i could tell i was getting sicker			2
i decided to just change my head around			0
" " the mind has the power to heal " while @entity2 says he knows his unorthodox recovery techniques sound " woo - woo " to some ears , they sound " like science " to dr. @entity142 , a best - selling author who 's written extensively on the mind - body connection			1
" this does n't sound woo - woo to me , " she says			2
" the mind has the power to heal			0
" she says by moving himself " from fear and abject terror into action , " @entity2 changed his body 's chemistry			1
" @entity154 increases cortisol and epinephrine in the body , which over time lower immunity , " she says			0
high levels of the two stress hormones lead to cellular inflammation , which is the way cancer begins , @entity142 says			2
taking action , as @entity2 eventually did , decreases the hormones			1
" @entity165 is actually a biochemical reaction in the body , " she says			0
dr. @entity167 , author of " @entity168 , " says it 's the same way an athlete uses visualization to improve performance			2
" when an athlete visualizes success , their body really is experiencing success			0
when you imagine something , your body really feels like it 's happening , " says @entity167 , a retired clinical assistant professor of surgery at @entity179			2
but dr. @entity183 , former editor - in - chief of @entity184 , calls the mind - body connection a " new religion " that encourages false hope			1
" there is something so biologically implausible that your attitude is going to cure a disease , " says @entity183 , a senior lecturer in social medicine at @entity190			0
" there 's a tremendous arrogance to imagine that your mind is all that powerful			0
" she says stories like @entity2 's are just that -- only stories and not proof that the mind - body connection is real			1
some other part of the patient 's treatment plan likely explains success against the disease , or in other cases , the success is temporary and part of the natural course of the disease			0
for example , she says bladder cancer often returns			1
" you beat it down , and it comes back , and you beat it down , and it comes back , " she says			0
" if [ @entity2 ] had bladder cancer , this may very well not be the end of the story			1
" more heart attacks on mondays while @entity183 points out there are no large - scale studies showing visualization can treat disease , there are studies that seem to indicate what happens in your mind has an effect on your body			1
for example , several studies have shown heart attacks occur more often on mondays , presumably because people are under increased stress returning to work after the weekend			0
another set of studies shows how you perceive yourself affects your health			0
in research done by the @entity246 and the @entity247 , young people who had positive perceptions about aging were less likely to have a heart attack or stroke when they grew older			0
in another study by researchers at @entity179 and @entity256 , middle aged and elderly people lived seven years longer if they had a positive perception about aging			0
in 2008 , @entity190 researchers published a study where they told a group of hotel chambermaids their daily cleaning activities counted as exercise and were equivalent to working out at a gym			0
a month later , these chambermaids had lost weight and lowered their blood pressure without changing anything , yet chambermaids who were n't told about the benefits of their daily work had no such changes			0
" it 's so damned obvious that your attitude effects survival , " says @entity167 , the retired @entity179 surgeon			0
to her , these studies show very little			1
" it 's a huge leap from these studies to saying you can imagine your way out of cancer , " she says			1
a visualization guide whether you 're convinced of the effects of visualization or not , @entity142 says there 's no harm in trying them , as long as you realize that like any other treatment , visualization might not work			0
there 's no definitive guide to visualization , but @entity167 , who 's instructed his patients in imaging for many years , has a few suggestions			0
first , he says to draw a picture of four things : yourself , your health problem , your treatment and your body eliminating your problem			0
these pictures might tell you what sort of imagery would work best for you			0
for example , when one of @entity167 's patients drew her disease as 10 cancer cells next to one white blood cell , he suggested she visualize her body making more white blood cells			1
second , he says to know yourself			0
one religious patient of his had been visualizing dogs attacking and eating up her cancer , which did n't work , so instead she pictured her tumor as a block of ice and @entity325 's light melting it away , which he says was more effective			0
third , he suggests not visualizing anything violent , since most of us are n't violent by nature			0
" children do n't mind being violent , and they 'll visualize blasting away cancer , and that 's fine , but most adults do n't like to kill , so that 's not an image they 're comfortable with , " he says			0
he remembers one patient who was a @entity337 and a pacifist , and quickly rejected any notion of " killing " or " beating " cancer			0
instead , he pictured white blood cells carrying cancer cells away , and he beat his cancer .			2

@entity2 , 73 , who just won an @entity3 , was told he had bladder cancer
he declined chemo , extensive surgery , believes visualization helped beat disease
no large - scale studies show visualization can treat disease , *ex-* medical *journal* editor says
