-- for conservatives conflicted over how to vote on a major measure wednesday that would fund the federal government and authorize the president to arm @entity8 rebels , their decision might have gotten a bit easier			1
the conservative group @entity10 announced that it will not hold lawmakers accountable for their vote			1
the bill , which would fund the government until mid-december , includes an amendment to arm @entity8 rebels to attack @entity16			1
@entity10 informed members of @entity18 that the group is " withdrawing its key vote " because " the @entity16 language does not make this a revealing vote about economic policy			2
" the group , which focuses on reducing government spending , keeps a scorecard of votes it deems important and uses it against members in re-election campaigns			2
with the club removing its pressure on the spending portion of the bill , conservatives who went to @entity18 to reduce the size of government are free to vote their conscience on the @entity16 provisions			2
@entity40 leaders lobby wavering colleagues ahead of @entity16 vote some members of @entity18 have been pushing for a stand - alone vote on @entity16 , insisting that the seriousness of the matter deserves its own debate			0
but @entity18 leadership in both parties are reluctant to hold a critical vote so close to the midterm elections , therefore tying it to a measure to keep the government functioning past september 30			0
also part of wednesday 's @entity40 vote is a measure to extend the authority of the @entity59 , a small government agency that has sparked the ire of tea party conservatives for subsidizing @entity63 businesses to conduct international trade			1
conservatives have been elevating the @entity59 vote for several months , but now that it is tied with the continuing resolution to fund the government and the @entity16 vote , it has almost disappeared as an issue			0
while conservatives are complaining that no one is focused on the bank anymore , the @entity16 component of the bill could help @entity40 speaker @entity75 , who supports the bank 's extension , to pass it			0
@entity0 's @entity79 contributed to this report .			0
