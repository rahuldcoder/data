@entity0 -- the conviction of a former @entity0 police officer for conspiring to kidnap , torture , cook and eat women has been overturned by a federal judge , who ruled that the evidence against him amounted to " fantasy role - play			1
" @entity11 , who has already served 21 months in jail and faced life in prison on the kidnap conspiracy conviction , did not say a word when he appeared in a federal courtroom tuesday			1
he smiled and waved at relatives in court			0
one woman , in tears , said before the hearing , " he 's coming home today			2
" prosecutors said they will appeal the decision , and bail for @entity11 was set at $ 100,000			2
he could be released as early as tuesday			0
defense attorney @entity26 said the decision backed up her assertion that @entity11 is " guilty of nothing more than very unconventional thoughts ... we do n't put people in jail for their thoughts			1
we are not the thought police and the court system is not the deputy of the thought police			2
" " @entity39 has been in jail for almost 21 months , seven months of that were in the indescribable hell that is solitary confinement , all for a crime that he did n't commit , " she said			1
@entity11 was ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation , and to surrender travel documents and weapons			2
@entity49 district court judge @entity48 also ordered gps home monitoring for the defendant			0
" the evidentiary record is such that it is more likely than not the case that all of @entity11 's internet communications about kidnapping are fantasy role - play , " @entity48 said in the 118 - page opinion released monday night			1
@entity11 's lawyers argued at his trial last year that the former police officer 's e-mails and online postings were just that -- " fantasy role - play " and " dark improv theater			1
" but prosecutors said he was " deadly serious			0
" in his decision , @entity48 ruled that " once the lies and the fantastical elements are stripped away , what is left are deeply disturbing misogynistic chats and emails written by an individual obsessed with imagining women he knows suffering horrific sex - related pain , terror and degradation			0
" " despite the highly disturbing nature of @entity11 's deviant and depraved sexual interests , his chats and emails about these interests are not sufficient -- standing alone -- to make out the elements of conspiracy to commit kidnapping , " he added			1
the trial evidence provided by prosecutors was not " sufficient to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that @entity11 entered into a genuine agreement to kidnap a woman , or that he specifically intended to commit a kidnapping			2
" @entity11 also was found guilty of illegally accessing a federal law enforcement database			2
the database , which @entity11 was trained to use and had access to as a police officer , helped him research potential victims , prosecutors said			1
no one was kidnapped , but the jury did see what prosecutors said were detailed plans to carry out a plot			0
@entity11 , a six - year @entity107 veteran , was convicted after prosecutors presented evidence such as a document found on his wife 's laptop titled " @entity113 -- a blueprint			1
" the same document listed " materials needed , " which included a gag , rope , chloroform and a tarp for the trunk			0
the @entity122 never found any of these items in @entity11 's possession			1
according to trial evidence , he communicated online with three co-conspirators on the @entity128 , prosecutors said			0
at trial , @entity26 called @entity11 's conduct " pure fiction " and " make - believe			1
" " he is anxious to get home to his family , the people who supported him through this whole ordeal , " she said of her client on tuesday			0
" i am sure he is very relieved , very tired			0
