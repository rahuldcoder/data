" in addition to @entity4 and @entity5 assistance , @entity1 said the @entity47 and @entity48 have agreed to consider giving their own loans to @entity2			1
@entity51 had long publicly insisted it would not seek an external bailout , despite widespread concerns that a ballooning budget deficit and wobbly banking sector would further cripple the @entity2 economy			2
yet a possible loan package was front - and - center during talks this week of @entity20 financial ministers			0
and officials from the @entity25 , the @entity26 and the @entity5 have been meeting officials from @entity2 's @entity63 and the @entity64 since thursday , hashing out measures required to bring stability to the @entity2 banking system			1

" at sunday night 's press conference in @entity51 , which followed a meeting of @entity1 's cabinet , @entity18 said the country would ask for less than 100 billion euros from the @entity4 and the @entity5			1
last may , those two bodies bailed @entity78 out to the tune of 110 billion euros ( currently $ 150 billion )			1
@entity1 said that the government planned to cut 6 billion euros before it wraps its current budgetary cycle on december 7 , and planned to eliminate a total of 15 billion euros over the next four years			1

" in part to meet its loan requirements , @entity51 also will set out a comprehensive four - year plan detailing its deficit - reduction and other measures to shore up the @entity2 economy , according to @entity1			0
he said that while corporate tax rates would stay unchanged , income tax levels would rise to 2006 levels			0
in addition , @entity1 said he 'd push new policies that would make @entity2 banks " significantly smaller than they have been in the past ... so they can be brought on their feet			0
" @entity2 shares the euro with 15 other @entity20 nations , and its perilous financial situations has raised concerns about a trickle - down effect on the common currency and the wider @entity4			1
responding to questions that a large outside loan might threaten @entity2 's sovereignty , @entity1 said the @entity2 's economy was already tightly tied into @entity20 's and said " support ... from our partners " encouraged him to support asking for their assistance			1
" our membership in the @entity4 has transformed our country for the better , " the prime minister said			1
" ( @entity126 ) the task of rebuilding our economy falls to our own ... people			0
" the money is required to stave off the collapse of @entity2 banks , which have seen a major outflow of funds over the last year , the @entity2 government said sunday			0
international loans would act as a contingency fund , @entity18 said earlier sunday , suggesting the mere fact that the funds were available might make it possible for @entity2 banks to borrow money on the open market again			2
the @entity2 government already has pumped billions of euros into @entity2 banks to keep them afloat , effectively nationalizing most of them			2
the @entity26 is lending money to @entity2 banks because other banks wo n't			0
one analyst said @entity2 has no choice now but to accept outside money			0
" in actual fact @entity2 as a country , in financial markets , has no reputation now			2
we 've got to rebuild it , and the reason you rebuild it -- or how you rebuild it -- is you rebuild your balance sheet , " author and economist @entity152 told @entity0			0
" the situation is , if there is no money , we ca n't pay			0
and there is no money			0
that 's why the @entity5 are here			2
if we had money , they would n't be here			0
