-- @entity1 is preparing to release its much - awaited response to the @entity3 , the @entity4 tablet , a month behind schedule			1
among other reasons , @entity6 is probably contributing to the delay			1
the @entity4 was supposed to be out the first quarter of 2011 but is now set to release april 19			1
some publications speculated on thursday that the @entity4 's late launch is related to touchscreen supply			1
the @entity4 also lacks a finished software development kit for making apps , and wo n't have native mail , messaging and contacts apps			2
difficulty getting @entity6 to work properly on the @entity4 is probably another one of @entity1 's woes			1
let 's take a look at the evidence			0
first , other tablet makers have had trouble with @entity6			2
@entity25 's @entity24 launched without it , despite the fact that @entity25 highlighted @entity6 support as a key feature			2
even though @entity29 10.2 for @entity30 is now available in the @entity31 , the version meant for @entity30 ( which the @entity24 runs ) is a prerelease version with significant limitations and lots of instability			0
second , sluggish performance and battery drainage have been problems for @entity6 before , and they 're the reason @entity42 ceo @entity41 gave for nixing @entity6 support on @entity42 's mobile products			2
the @entity44 , which runs an earlier version of @entity30 , is the only major tablet that currently supports a shipping version of the @entity48 plugin			0
finally , @entity50 's @entity49 tried a @entity4 tablet at @entity52 and reported that @entity6 performance proved to be a " choppy and ( ironically ) limiting experience			1
" @entity1 officials at the time were tight - lipped about the tablet 's expected battery life , saying only that it would be more than an hour			0
that was an early version of the tablet , but choppiness in one of its key features does n't bode well			0
without great flash support , a @entity4 tablet would practically have nothing to do			0
last year @entity1 drummed up @entity6 support for the upcoming @entity4 , saying that it was going to deliver the full internet experience			1
that would , in theory , give the @entity4 an edge over the @entity3			0
" we 're not trying to dumb down the internet for a small mobile device , " says @entity73 , @entity1 's ceo , during the @entity4 demonstration			2
" what we 're trying to do is bring up the performance and capability of the mobile device to the internet			0
" @entity1 's planned april 19 launch lines up with @entity48 's claims that @entity6 will be available for tablets " within a few weeks of @entity30 3 @entity30 devices becoming available			1
" it 's been six weeks since @entity25 released the @entity24 , and april 19 is probably as long as @entity48 can wait before @entity6 can no longer be considered " a few weeks " late			1
