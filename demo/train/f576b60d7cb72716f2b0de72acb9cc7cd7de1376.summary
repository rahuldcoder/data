-- filing nervously into a sports hall in @entity4 , northern @entity2 , around 20 girls prepared to practice gymnastics			1
compared to their male counterparts at @entity9 's @entity8 , their number is small			0
another difference is that the gates to the sports hall were locked behind them and an announcement made that the hall was exclusively allocated for women			1
@entity17 @entity16 , a rhythmic gymnastics trainer says the facilities are not ideal : " there are pillars in the hall which limit free movement and rotational flips			0
this hall was initially designed for physical fitness			0
" behind another locked gate @entity26 was coaching the university 's recently formed five - a - side female football team			1
" women 's participation has shrunk following the 2003 events , " said @entity26			2
" however , this did not prevent women from exercising and participating in sports tournaments			1
our women 's football team took part in the tournament that took place in @entity42 in 2010			2
" on the separation between the two genders in sports @entity26 thinks " it is a right step for both of them at the present time			2
" it seems that the way society views women in @entity4 and much of the surrounding @entity54 province is reflected in the attitude towards women 's participation in sports			1
some believe that it 's inappropriate , like @entity60 , is a 22 - year - old student			0
" i do n't like women 's participation in sports			1
it is not a civilized phenomenon			0
therefore , i will not allow my sister or a female relative to participate in sports or to join an athletic club or faculty , " he said			2
" what makes me reject the idea is what i heard about the presence of boys and girls together , in addition to the presence of male coaches			0
i also do not like the idea of women wearing sports uniforms			1
" while the majority of men in @entity4 do not agree with women 's participation in sports , some women support it			1
one of them is 20 year old @entity89			0
" i do encourage women 's engagement in sports , provided that they do their exercises in the absence of men so that they will feel at ease , at least with regard to wearing the sports uniform , " she said			1
" i believe that religious considerations are the main reason behind the families ' objections to their daughters joining faculties of sport			2
" @entity105 is deputy representative of the @entity106 in @entity54			0
he also believes that family disapproval and social conditions prevent more women participating in sport , as well as more of them wearing hijab ( head scarves ) " we have a female volleyball team which ranks second in @entity2 , " said @entity105			1
" however , all the teams are found in @entity117 because of the better security situation in the area as well as the positive social views about female athletes , which is almost free of perceptions of inferiority			1
" @entity125 , 22 , a talented and enthusiastic athlete , said that wearing the hijab did not prevent her from taking part in sports			1
" i do not support the present separation between us and our male colleagues , " she said			0
" there is nothing that prevents me from exercising with them			0
i do n't pay attention to society 's views because my sole wish is to learn and improve my athletic skills			0
my father often encourages me to get rid of the state of social shyness			0
" when society constitutes a barrier , parents may support their daughters and lead them towards success and allow them to travel and participate in athletic contests			0
but the case of @entity125 is quite different from that of @entity151 who plays on the five - a - side football team			0
" my family did not allow me to join the @entity154 , " she said			0
" therefore , at the end of the day , when my lectures finish , i join the team to attend training drills and exercises			2
of course my male and female colleagues do not know about my coming here because they do not welcome the idea			0
" in @entity2 religion has its say concerning women 's involvement in sport and taking part in contests			1
" women 's sport nowadays is a cause for molestation of women , particularly the sports that are covered by media and broadcast to the public , " said @entity171 , imam and preacher at the @entity173 and a member of @entity2 's @entity175 in @entity54			1
" the aim of this is merely to export women to the @entity186			2
however , women may exercise and do their drills inside confined halls , separately from men , while wearing their legal dresses			1
" " the limited role of women in the athletic field in terms of winning medals , good results , flags and participation does not constitute any risk to the country , and female athletes winning medals and cups is not an achievement for the country and does not contribute to its development , " @entity192 added			2
religious and social views are almost the same and seem to have contributed to the difficulties many women find in joining in sports in @entity2 .			1

women in @entity4 , northern @entity2 , must practice sports behind *closed* , locked doors
many men and women disapprove of women in sport and are against mixed gender training
situation is different outside of @entity4 where there is a more positive view of women in sport
some use wearing of hijab as excuse to say women can not compete *effectively* in sports
