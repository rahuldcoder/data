and that 's a lesson i 've learned , " @entity0 said in his first public comments since the @entity12 announced he will be suspended without pay			1
" and it 's one that it 's easy to get carried away in regards to a certain side of the ball , or more involved offensively or defensively , and that 's something i regret			0

" @entity88 has said the " pay - for - performance " program " undermined the integrity of the game			0
" a statement last week from the @entity12 on the website @entity12 added that the violations " were compounded by the failure of coach @entity0 to supervise the players and coaches and his affirmative decision starting in 2010 ( a ) not to inquire into the facts concerning the pay - for - performance / bounty program even though he was aware of the league 's inquiries both in 2010 and 2012 ; ( b ) to falsely deny that the program existed ; ( c ) to encourage the false denials by instructing assistants to ' make sure our ducks are in a row ; ' and ( d ) to ignore instructions from the league office and club ownership to ensure that no such program existed			1
" " when interviewed in 2012 , @entity0 claimed to be entirely unaware of the program , a claim contradicted by others , " the statement said			0
" further , prior to the @entity1 ' opening game in 2011 , coach @entity0 received an email from a close associate that stated in part , ' ps @entity132 put me down for $ 5000 on @entity140 ( sic )			1
' when shown the email during the course of the investigation , coach @entity0 stated that it referred to a ' bounty ' on @entity39 quarterback @entity38			2
