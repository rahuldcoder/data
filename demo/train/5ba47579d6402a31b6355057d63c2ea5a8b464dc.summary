@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity2 and @entity3 both scored twice to fire leaders @entity4 to a 4 - 0 win at @entity7 , their 10th consecutive @entity9 victory			1
@entity2 scored two first - half goals as @entity4 cruised to a 4 - 0 victory at @entity7			1
hearts found themselves ripped apart by a rampant @entity4 side , who sent out a clear message to rivals @entity16 by maintaining their four - point advantage at the summit			1
@entity2 claimed the opener after 25 minutes , cutting inside from the left and squeezing his shot inside the far post from a tight angle			0
the same player added a second two minutes before the break , scoring from close range after a @entity28 corner was not cleared			0
@entity2 was withdrawn for @entity3 at the interval , but if @entity7 thought the departure of the @entity32 meant some much - needed respite , they were sadly mistaken			1
@entity3 was on the pitch for seven minutes when he helped himself to a goal of his own			0
@entity37 set up the shot with a low ball across goal and all that was required from the striker was to bundle home from close range			0
the same two players combined again to supply @entity4 with their fourth goal with 69 minutes gone			0
@entity37 was again the provider and this time @entity3 produced a cheeky back - heel finish from five meters			2
meanwhile , goals by @entity50 and @entity51 gave @entity16 a hard - fought 2 - 1 win at home to @entity54			1
@entity56 international @entity50 's 25th goal of the season right on the interval gave the champions the lead and his @entity62 team - mate bulleted an @entity64 cross past goalkeeper @entity65 on the hour mark			0
but the final minutes were needlessly fraught for @entity16 after @entity68 striker @entity67 took advantage of @entity71 's misplaced pass to pull a goal back in the 70th minute			2

rangers **remain** four points clear in @entity1 after a superb 4 - 0 win at @entity7
@entity2 and @entity3 both net twice for the league leaders
