-- at the middle of his first presidential term , @entity1 faces major electoral challenges , some of which have come to involve questions of religious identity and power			1
a few have revived suspicion about @entity1 's religious identity , especially after he said he supported @entity14 's decision to permit the construction of an @entity17 cultural center near the site of ground zero			1
at the same time , some prominent black figures have accused @entity1 of ignoring @entity22 concerns and tens of millions of " churched " black voters			2
on the one hand , @entity1 faces religious xenophobia ; on the other , he faces the mobilization of critical voices among a religious population that @entity29 have long taken for granted			1
with fierce midterm election battles at hand and his prospects for a second term as president uncertain , we might expect @entity1 to revisit the strategy of a president who faced similar religious challenges more than 70 years ago : @entity39			1
in the lead - up to @entity39 's own re-election in 1936 , some religious sectors charged his @entity43 and the repeal of @entity45 constituted an attack on traditional christian values			1
meanwhile , he could hardly take for granted the black vote			0
the @entity29 was understood as the party of the openly violent @entity50 , where millions of @entity22 remained disenfranchised			0
but by the middle of his first term , @entity39 and the @entity51 knew they would need to reach out to @entity56 black voters , who were growing in numbers yet had been only partly swayed by the limited availability of @entity43 emergency relief			2
criticism from black churches was on the rise , just as it seems to be now			1
in 1934 , right at the midpoint of the first @entity39 administration , the major black denominations formed the @entity66 , specifically to push a social justice agenda and protest , if need be , at the national level			2
black religious publications reported racial discrimination in @entity43 and were incredulous about his refusal to promote an anti-lynching bill			0
@entity39 , in his electoral strategy , reached out extensively to @entity22 local and national religious leaders , including those of the @entity66 , through the @entity80 of the @entity81			2
the league recruited sympathetic clergy to lead political discussion clubs in black congregations and planned major events in churches in 25 @entity56 cities			0
these events highlighted the @entity43 's tangible benefits to black people , portrayed the @entity43 and roosevelt himself as rooted in " social gospel " values of equality and justice and elevated certain @entity66 leaders to positions of unprecedented visibility			0
not only did black people shift decisively to the @entity29 in the election of 1936 , but the social gospel movement that @entity39 championed gained enough prominence in black religion that it became a keystone of the civil rights movement			2
meanwhile , the @entity66 of @entity106 , which had always promoted a black social gospel , gained its political foothold during the @entity39 years and provided the institutional template for national church - based protest groups such as the @entity111			1
president @entity113 's @entity112 may be understood as an adaptation of @entity39 's black religious strategy , although @entity113 was not promoting the social gospel			1
from its inception , @entity113 's @entity116 elevated individualistic , moral reform strategies over strategies emphasizing public responsibility for poverty and structural solutions to inequality			0
as @entity113 stated at the @entity129 's inaugural event , " we will help all in their work to change hearts ... " @entity1 has rebranded and reformed @entity129 as an interfaith think tank , designed to generate new ideas and discover best practices , but it is uncertain how the new @entity129 will mediate electoral challenges			0
president @entity1 did , however , meet with 20 black church leaders in march 2010 to solicit opinions and prayers			1
just a month earlier , the heads of seven major black denominations launched the @entity140 , the lineage of which goes back to the @entity66			0
while upholding the value of individual responsibility and transformation , this ecumenical body also advocates for social and economic justice and is concerned with the structural aspects of black poverty , crises in education , health and housing , staggering incarceration rates and more			0
the @entity154 has already reached out to @entity1 and denounced religious xenophobia by supporting his remarks on the proposed @entity17 center near ground zero			0
@entity1 , like @entity39 , could turn to the nationally organized black churches to shore up electoral turnout while neutralizing fears about his own religious intentions			1
like the @entity66 and the early black @entity165 proponents , the freshly mobilized black churches could use this moment in national political history to lay the groundwork for a social change movement of unprecedented proportions			1
if history is any indication , pivotal times are ahead at the intersection of national politics and black religion			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			0

@entity181 : @entity1 faces criticism from blacks and fears of *commitment* to @entity186
@entity39 also faced religious challenges , criticism from *african* - americans , he writes
he says @entity39 enlisted black church to build up trust among a disenfranchised group
@entity1 could turn to black churches to bring out vote and prove religious identity , he says
