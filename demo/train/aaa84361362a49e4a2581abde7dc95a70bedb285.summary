-- it 's a question that 's plagued mankind for centuries -- how do you create an earthly structure worthy of the divine ? should it be a lavish building of rich materials and awe - inspiring stature , a grand gesture to the grandest of beliefs ? or perhaps a humble place of reflection , a simple sanctum bowing to a power far mightier than itself ? for authorities in @entity18 , it seems bigger is better , as they have recently unveiled plans for the world 's largest @entity21 -- a sprawling , maze - like complex stretching across 190 acres			1
at 123 meters tall , @entity25 in @entity27 district will be almost three times the height of @entity29 in @entity30 , currently the world 's largest @entity21			1
featuring 18 dusky pink temples with golden spires reaching to the clouds , the mammoth building in the north west of the country will have enough seating for 20,000 people			0
modern marvels should the dream come true , it would be a remarkable feat of engineering			2
and as architecture continues to develop -- both technologically and stylistically -- so too do the ways we imagine our sacred structures			1
a @entity21 can now be the size of seven american football fields , if plans for @entity25 are anything to go by			1
at the same time , a church no longer requires a pointed roof with a steeple			0
it can be a black steel cube , as slick as the skyscrapers surrounding it			0
or even be transformed into a concrete bunker , partially submerged from the hot desert sun. how is religious architecture morphing in a modern age ? it was this question which prompted editors @entity65 and @entity67 to compile their book " closer to @entity69 : @entity70 and @entity71 , " which examines spectacular contemporary buildings from across the globe			1
" architecture covers a wide span across the history of mankind -- from the basic housing of the mud hut to the complex system of a medieval cathedral , all the way to a modern day skyscraper , " said 36 - year - old @entity65 , who lectures on architecture and culture at design colleges across @entity77			1
" yet even now many architects see the sacred or religious building as the architectural brief par excellence , because more than any other type of building , they demand spatial and artistic coherence			1
" world of wonder from minimalist @entity98 shrines that mimic the womb , to sci - fi wedding chapels resembling glowing pods , the book 's sumptuous images reveal a surprising array of sacred structures built in the last few years			1
in the small town of @entity107 , in central @entity105 , an abandoned 15th century seminary has been converted into a home for retired priests -- with a playful twist			0
inside @entity107 , you 'll find lime - colored walls , neon crosses , whacky wheel benches , and an assortment of vintage lamps			2
" the whole building was organized to watch over the lives of the young males being educated there , " explained architect @entity117			0
" it was all about sacrifice , control , and austerity			0
" " we completely transformed it into a building where life would be seen as a celebration -- from breakfast , to laundry , and gardening			0
and we did that by using colors that were related to social happiness			0
" while the bold design was initially met with some skepticism , it appears to have opened up the once - secretive grounds to the community			2
" the challenge we face as designers is n't just about architecture , it 's about religion as a whole -- what role does it play in society ? " said @entity117			1
function and feeling indeed , not only must religious architecture evoke an otherworldly feeling -- it must also function as a community center , study area , and even business space			1
so how do architects tick all the boxes ? " it 's quite a challenge , " says @entity65			2
" architecture 's usual criteria of purpose , access , capacity , construction , and financial viability are simply not enough -- in religious buildings the question of meaning , image and symbol are also integral to the task			1
" " what i find particularly curious and inspiring about this topic is it 's inherent contradictions , " he added			2
" religious buildings always have to bridge the gap of being literally a ' concrete ' implementation of a highly abstract idea			2
" sound of silence cast your eye across these striking photographs , and the most evocative buildings are often the most unassuming			0
like the simple aluminum chapel in @entity188 , a warm glow emanating from its pine wood interior			0
or the white cube prayer and meditation room in @entity193 , bare except for two small trees inside			0
it 's part of a growing trend in religious architecture to shy away from ostentatious iconography , and instead allow the visitor to immerse themselves in light - filled serenity			1
" this concise style leaves visitors free to fill it with their own thoughts , wishes , and prayers , " said @entity65			0
" the interplay of light , emptiness and stillness seems to express a sacred quality in these spaces			0
" see : @entity215 's most exquisite libraries learn : psychology of curvy architecture			2

@entity18 plans to build world 's largest @entity21 , towering 123 meters tall
but creating sacred structures in the modern age is not for the faint - *hearted*
spectacular book explores religious architecture from across the world
new trend *rejects* ostentatious iconography , in favor of minimalism
