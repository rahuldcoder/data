@entity16 , according to friends and his attorney , @entity21 , said he killed @entity7 , 17 , in self - defense			1
the fact he has n't been charged in @entity7 's killing has outraged many in the @entity26 , including people who believe @entity7 was considered " suspicious " because he was black			1
@entity16 is a white @entity28			2
yet no one has gone as far as the @entity30 , which on its website advocates a revolution for african - americans			0
the group -- which is distinct from the better known @entity1 , founded in the late 1960s -- is described by the @entity35 as a hate group and a " virulently racist and anti-semitic organization			1
" on saturday , the party put out a wanted poster offering money in return for a " legal citizen 's arrest " of @entity16			1
@entity11 said that same day that his group believed in " a life for a life , " an assertion that he reiterated on monday			0

" " according to the street people 's law , ( @entity16 ) has been charged with murder -- according to street law , according to @entity81 's law , " @entity11 said			1
the city of @entity18 earlier responded to the bounty offer , and the @entity30 's push to have 5,000 men work together to go after @entity16 , by calling for " calm heads and no vigilante justice			2

@entity95 , a friend of @entity16 's , said such threats are weighing heavily on his friend , even if authorities and the @entity7 family are denouncing them			1
@entity16 has n't been seen or heard from in public since the shooting , " that 's why no one knows where he 's at , " @entity95 said			2
" he should be concerned for his safety			0
