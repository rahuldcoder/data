-- @entity4 presidential candidate @entity3 's " @entity2 problem " is well documented			1
now , the former @entity7 senator 's chief political rival , former @entity8 gov. @entity5 , appears to be joining him			1
on friday , a @entity2 search for @entity5 's name was delivering a site called " @entity12 " as one of its top results			1
the spoof site ( which , as will soon become apparent , is in no way associated with the @entity4 candidate or his campaign ) is a twist on a site that caused @entity3 to ask @entity2 to bury it			1
" @entity29 " popped up on the @entity22 after the then - senator angered gay - rights advocates in 2003 with a comment that compared homosexuality to bestiality and pedophilia			0
a podcast host and sex columnist created the site , which " defines " @entity3 's name with an explicit and lewd term we wo n't repeat here			2
as the site was shared around the @entity22 , it gained in @entity2 's search algorithm until it became the top search result for @entity3 's name			1
on friday , it remained second after his official campaign site			0
the @entity5 site also offers a fake definition for his name , one that 's not quite as foul as @entity3 's but still profane and far from complimentary			1
the site is registered to @entity48 , a web design company based in @entity50 , @entity51			0
@entity48 ceo @entity52 confirmed in an e-mail that he is the site 's owner			0
he said the " definition " he chose for @entity5 ( and this will make sense if you visit the site ) is a reference to a years - old @entity57 report about @entity5 and his family traveling to @entity59 with the family dog in a crate on the roof of his car			1
the dog relieved itself in the crate , according to the story , leading @entity5 to hose him down at a gas station and continue the trip			0
@entity52 said the @entity3 site obviously inspired his creation			2
" while many consider both of the sites to be crude , i consider them to be a comedic way to bring attention to important issues , much in line with how @entity84 might bring attention to an important issue , " he said in an e-mail			0
some of @entity3 's other rivals are getting similar treatment			2
at " spreading @entity90 , " a contest is under way to create a definition for the former @entity95 speaker 's name			2
that site , however , does n't rank very high in a search for " @entity90			0
" at least not yet			0
as sites get more traffic and are linked from other sites , they gain traction in @entity2 searches , rising closer to the coveted first page of results			1
the @entity22 snark has also crossed the political aisle			0
with a little bit of tinfoil - hat flair , " spreading @entity108 " ( which , interestingly , bears the			2
org reserved for nonprofits ) , defines the @entity116 president 's name as " a puppet of the @entity118			0
" say what you will , but at least we could print that one			0
in september , @entity3 asked @entity2 to remove the offensive site from its search results , going so far as to suggest the company would probably do so for a @entity126			1
@entity2 refused , saying it " very rarely " removes content , and only when it is illegal or explicitly violates @entity2 's terms of service			2
for the record , there 's also a " spreading @entity136 " site , which appears to be a sincere endorsement of the @entity7 congressman and fellow @entity4 presidential candidate .			1

@entity5 joins @entity4 rival @entity3 with a @entity2 search - results problem
new site , " spreading @entity5 , " gives a profane , fake definition of candidate 's name
sites for @entity147 , president @entity108 also exist , but have less traction
