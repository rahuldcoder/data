@entity0 was the last @entity1 king to lose his life on the battlefield			1
scientists who have been testing his remains -- found under a parking lot in the @entity1 city of @entity8 -- now believe they know how he died			1
the 15th - century king was best known to modern @entity10 as the hunchbacked @entity12 villain accused of murdering his nephews , the " @entity13 , " to usurp the throne			0
his life has always been a controversial chapter in @entity1 lore			0
although he ruled for only two years ( 1483 - 85 ) and died at the age of 32 , there has been an ongoing debate over @entity0 's portrayal in both @entity1 history and @entity1 literature			1
according to historians , the king 's defeat and death at @entity27 ended the @entity29 and marked the end of the @entity31 in @entity1			2
though he was a royal , his body was given to local monks , and he was buried in a crude grave in an unknown location			0
it was not until archaeologists from the @entity38 discovered his remains under a parking lot in 2012 that people learned where his body had been buried			1
since that time , both scientists and medical researchers have studied the remains to better understand how @entity0 lived and died			1
now , researchers have used modern forensic analysis to reveal that he suffered 11 injuries at or near the time of death , according to a new study published in @entity52			1
of those , three had the potential to cause death quickly : two to the skull and one to the pelvis			0
and the scientists believe that the skull injuries were the ones that killed the last monarch from the @entity62			2
@entity8 to be final burial place of @entity0 " @entity0 's injuries represent a sustained attack or an attack by several assailants with weapons from the later medieval period , " said professor @entity64 , one of the authors of the study			1
" the wounds to the skull suggest that he was not wearing a helmet , and the absence of defensive wounds on his arms and hands indicate that he was otherwise still armored at the time of his death			2
" the injury to his pelvis might have been inflicted after his death , the team surmised , since the kind of armor that would have been worn by the king in the late 15th century would have protected that area			0
" i think the most surprising injury is the one to the pelvis , " @entity64 said			0
" we believe that this corresponds to contemporary accounts of @entity0 being slung over the back of the horse to be taken back to @entity8 after the @entity27 , as this would give someone the correct body position to inflict this injury			2
" there were nine injuries to the skull in total and two elsewhere on the skeleton			0
the team used whole - body ct scans and @entity108 imaging of injured bones to analyze trauma , according to a news release from @entity52			0
they also looked at tool marks on the bones to try to establish what kind of weapons were used			0
" the most likely injuries to have caused the king 's death are the two to the inferior aspect of the skull -- a large sharp force trauma possibly from a sword or staff weapon , such as a halberd or bill , and a penetrating injury from the tip of an edged weapon , " said professor @entity116 , a co-author of the study			2
" @entity0 's head injuries are consistent with some near - contemporary accounts of the battle , which suggest that @entity0 abandoned his horse after it became stuck in a mire and was killed while fighting his enemies			1
" although the findings are interesting to historians , the question remains : do they change the accounts of @entity0 's last moments in battle ? since none of the wounds overlapped , the researchers were not able to tell in exactly what order they occurred			1
" the ( investigators ) provide a compelling account , giving tantalizing glimpses into the validity of the historic accounts of his death , which were heavily edited by the @entity159 in the following 200 years , " said @entity149 of the @entity150 in @entity151			0
" i am sure that @entity0 will continue to divide opinion fiercely for centuries to come			0
" after a legal battle , it has been decided that the medieval king will be reburied next spring in @entity165 , just a stone 's throw from where his remains were uncovered			2
bones reveal king 's taste for luxury food , wine @entity0 had worms , scientists say			1

scientists have analyzed @entity0 's skeletal remains to see how he was killed
they found evidence of 11 injuries at the time of death , three of them potentially *fatal*
two head injuries are the most likely to have killed the king , scientists say
@entity0 's remains were found in 2012 under a parking lot in the city of @entity8
