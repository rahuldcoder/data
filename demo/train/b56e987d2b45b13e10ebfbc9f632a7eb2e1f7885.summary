-- living in a house made from shipping containers is n't exactly everyone 's idea of a dream home			2
but a new design could change all that , building on the ethos of sustainability without cramping your style ... or your space			2
@entity13 distinguishes itself from the container crowd , says its @entity16 and @entity17 creators , by not only being a structure but also a vehicle for all structural components of the house			1
@entity23 - based architect @entity22 and @entity24 , a @entity17 aircraft structural engineer , joined forces just over a year ago to build on @entity24 's original idea for incorporating shipping containers within a bespoke steel shell			1
the containers form part of the foundation for the building , @entity24 says , as well as being a building block that aids the quick and easy assembly of the frame around it			0
@entity22 , who specializes in sustainable design , was familiar with recent innovations in container housing , he says , but @entity24 's idea immediately stood out			1
" i think its advantages over traditional housing are quite profound			2
it 's an excellent option for emergency housing -- the containers could be shipped to a site in large quantities , set down and assembled very quickly , " @entity22 said			1
" the other thing is that it does n't need a typical foundation			0
it can actually be put down right on the ground or on concrete blocks or pin piles , " he said			0
@entity22 envisages other markets for @entity13 beyond emergency housing , with a two - story house targeted at the affordable housing market and a 1,300 square feet three - story structure retailing for approximately $ 80 - 100,000			1
@entity60 , professor of architecture at the @entity17 's @entity62 and author of " @entity64 : the @entity67 of the @entity68 , " says sustainability is " very , very crucial " and is driving architectural design more and more			1
" @entity69 is a fantastic way to make things quicker , more economical and improve quality			0
and trying to find new ways to make affordable housing is obviously important , " he said			1
he points to the successes already achieved in this area by @entity79 architectural firm @entity80 -- one of the pioneers of container housing -- and @entity84 , founder of the @entity86 - based @entity85			1
" what it comes down to in the end is the quality of the system you are creating , " @entity60 says , " how things fit together , how good the parts are , how easy it is to assemble			0
it 's really about practice , testing and making sure it works			0
" with a patent for the @entity101 design granted in may this year , @entity24 and @entity22 are ready to take their project to the next level			2
with the help of sponsorship from a @entity16 non-profit organization , @entity22 says a fully functioning prototype is on schedule to be completed by the spring of 2013			2
" we intend to sell @entity13 internationally , " @entity22 said , " so people could order just the structural parts or a turnkey option -- where we would provide all the exterior wall panels and parts			0
" @entity24 hopes @entity13 will change the " @entity118 " perception of shipping containers at a price which wo n't break the bank			0
" if you make this thing aesthetically pleasing , people will buy it , " he says , " and it promotes the greener side of things			0
