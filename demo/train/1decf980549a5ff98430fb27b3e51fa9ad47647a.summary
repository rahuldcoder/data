in what has been described as one of the largest cheating scandals to hit the nation 's public education system , 35 @entity6 educators and administrators were indicted friday on charges of racketeering and corruption			1
the indictment is the bookend to a story that was once touted as a model for the nation 's school districts after the district 's test scores dramatically improved in some of its toughest urban schools			2

@entity25 resigned from her position in 2011 following the state investigation , which lambasted her leadership and found widespread cheating in dozens of @entity29 schools			1
the alleged cheating is believed to date back to early 2001 , according to the indictment , when standardized testing scores began to turn around in the 50,000 - student school district			1

in 2009 , @entity25 was named the @entity110 by the @entity111 , which at the time said her " leadership has turned @entity29 into a model of urban school reform			0
" but the indictment paints another picture of @entity25 , one of a superintendent with " a single - minded purpose , and that is to cheat , " @entity30 told reporters			1
" for example , teachers who reported other teachers who cheated were terminated , while teachers who were caught cheating were only suspended , " the indictment alleges			1
" the message from @entity25 was clear : there were to be no exceptions and no excuses for failure to meet targets			0
" at the heart of the conspiracy to cheat , the indictment said , was money			0
" it is further part of the conspiracy and endeavor that targets achieved through cheating were used by @entity25 to obtain substantial performance bonuses , " the indictment said			1
it also alleges a number of others received performance bonuses based on test scores			0
