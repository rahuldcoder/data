-- the @entity2 ' nuclear watchdog agency confirmed monday that uranium enrichment has begun at a nuclear facility in northern @entity5			1
on sunday , a fundamentalist @entity5 newspaper with ties to the nation 's supreme leader said the enrichment had begun at the plant , which is " immune to any military attack			1
" security clearance : @entity5 's underground program " based on reports we received yesterday , @entity5 has begun uranium enrichment at the @entity21 facility at the height of the threats by foreign enemies , " the semi-official @entity16 newspaper said			1
" the @entity26 can confirm that @entity5 has started the production of uranium enriched up to 20 % " at @entity21 , said @entity26 spokeswoman @entity25			1
" all nuclear material in the facility remains under the agency 's containment and surveillance			0
" the @entity21 nuclear enrichment plant is in the mountains of @entity37 province , where @entity5 says it has 3,000 centrifuges in operation			1
another nuclear facility in @entity41 is said to have 8,000 of the machines enriching uranium			0
@entity5 says there 's a medical purpose behind the nuclear program			1
" in order to provide medical assistance to 800,000 cancer patients , @entity5 needs to enrich uranium up to 20 % to be able to feed @entity54 's ( research ) reactor that produces the needed radioisotopes , " the paper reported			1
in @entity58 , @entity57 spokesman @entity56 said the confirmation that @entity5 is enriching uranium to " a level that 's inappropriate " is " obviously a problem			2
" " we are closely monitoring their nuclear program in general , and this development , given their track record and what the @entity26 inspectors have been able to report , it 's not a surprise to us , what we 're hearing			1
" she said the @entity26 has been able to get into the @entity21 facility " on and off			2
" " they 've been able to get into some facilities at some times , but what they 're finding , as they get in there , is that @entity5 is not complying with its obligations , " she said			0
" @entity5 plays this game with the inspectors			0
they let them go some places at some times when it seems to suit their purposes , but that does n't change the fact that what the inspectors are now reporting is that they are taking the next step and escalating their violations of their own commitments			0
" the @entity5 government announced in july that it was installing a new generation of centrifuges in its nuclear facilities			2
at the time , the @entity102 called the development " a new wave of provocation " that flouted @entity2 resolutions			0
enriched uranium at low concentrations can be used to fuel power plants , but in extremely high concentrations it can be used to produce a nuclear bomb			0
uranium enriched to between 3 % and 5 % is necessary to make fuel for reactors			0
weapons - grade uranium is enriched to about 90 %			0
if @entity5 is enriching uranium to 20 % , " this is a further escalation of their ongoing violations with regard to their nuclear obligations , including the legally binding @entity122 resolution , " @entity56 said			1
" so , obviously , we call on @entity5 once again to suspend enrichment activities , cooperate fully with the @entity26 and immediately comply with all @entity122 and @entity26 board of governors resolutions			2
" " when you enrich to 20 % , there is no possible reason for that , if you 're talking about a peaceful program , " she said			1
" so it generally tends to indicate that you are enriching to a level that takes you to a different kind of nuclear program			2
" @entity5 's development of missile and nuclear fuel technology has led to @entity2 sanctions and accusations from @entity58 that the clerical regime is trying to develop nuclear weapons			2
security clearance : what might prompt the @entity146 to attack officials in the @entity146 and other @entity150 nations have ratcheted up sanctions against @entity5 since a november report by the @entity26 said the @entity5 government was developing the technology needed to build a nuclear weapon			1
last month , @entity146 president @entity156 announced sanctions against @entity5 's central bank			2
" we are putting a great deal of pressure on @entity5 broadly because of its rogue behavior , if you will , the fact that it wo n't live up to its international obligations with regards to its nuclear program , " @entity160 spokesman @entity159 said monday			1
" those actions that we 're taking in concert with our international partners have had a significant impact on @entity5 , on the @entity5 economy			0
" he added , " i believe it was just last week where the new sanctions , when they went into effect , had the impact of causing the @entity5 currency to drop dramatically			0
so we work with our partners , as well as unilaterally , to increase that pressure			0
" @entity5 says it has a right to peaceful nuclear technology			2
the @entity26 has said it can not verify whether the intent of @entity54 's nuclear program remains peaceful			1
security clearance : @entity5 's influence in @entity189 in sunday 's report , the fundamentalist paper appeared to thumb its nose at the @entity193			0
" @entity21 is located deep inside mountains and due to its location is immune to any military attack , " the article said			0
" locating the 20 % enrichment facility at @entity21 means that the military threat option against @entity5 's nuclear program will be removed from the table forever and the @entity193 will be forced to slowly realize the immunity of this program against any foreign threat			1
" @entity0 's @entity205 and @entity206 contributed to this report .			0
