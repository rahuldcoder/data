-- the @entity2 team has denied reports that seven - time world @entity5 champion @entity4 must improve next season or face having his three - year contract cut short			1
the 41 - year - old has struggled in his comeback season , having retired in 2006 , and has been outperformed by young teammate @entity11			1
@entity11 , 25 , is seventh in the drivers ' standings with four races to go -- while @entity4 is 76 points back in 10th as @entity2 has been unable to emulate the success of the double world champion @entity18 team that the @entity20 manufacturer took over at the end of last year			1
@entity20 newspaper @entity22 reported this week that @entity4 's future was in doubt unless he did better in 2011 , but @entity26 vice-president @entity25 dismissed those claims while talking to reporters at a conference at the @entity31 @entity30			1
" of course there was no ultimatum , " @entity25 said after friday 's practice sessions at @entity33 , a circuit where @entity4 has won six times and was eighth in both runs			1
@entity11 was 10th and 11th			0
@entity41 duo top practice times " i think @entity4 again showed today his class , his full commitment			2
we are currently a little bit handicapped with our car , but i have no complaints and no regrets that we 're going to achieve our target			0
" @entity4 is , for me , as good as he ever was and probably even better			2
he 's relaxed , concentrated			0
he does n't need anybody to defend him , certainly not me , but we are very happy with the job he 's doing and we need to give @entity11 and him a better car			0
" @entity25 admitted that @entity11 had done a better job in getting the best out of his car , and acclaimed him as the best of the young drivers on the @entity5 circuit			1
" it 's not easy for anybody to compete against such a guy , and @entity4 does that quite well -- not always in qualifying but if you look throughout the season , if you take into consideration that he was not in @entity5 for three years , we are heading in the right direction and there is certainly not an ultimatum , " he said			1
meanwhile , reports have claimed that @entity2 could face competition from another @entity20 team in the near future , with @entity75 considering a return to the grid for the first time since 1964			1
@entity75 provided engine for @entity80 when the @entity82 outfit won five world drivers ' and manufacturers ' titles in the 1980s , but has not been involved in motorsport 's elite class since 1991			2
the @entity88 reported on friday that @entity75 was considering a comeback , while the company 's new chairman @entity90 hinted as much to the @entity93 website			2
he suggested that @entity94 , which is also owned by @entity95 and has previously said it is not interested in racing in @entity5 , may focus on @entity97 sportscar racing			0
" with @entity97 , there are two classes and two brands : @entity94 and @entity75			0
we do not like both to go into @entity97 , that is not so funny			0
so therefore we have to discuss whether it makes better sense for one of the brands to go into @entity97 , and the other brand into @entity5			0
so we will have a round - table to discuss the pros and cons , " he said in an interview at the @entity111 .			0
