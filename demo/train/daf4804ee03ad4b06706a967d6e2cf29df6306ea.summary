-- in the midst of a swirl of rumors about @entity4 , a woman who accuses him of sexual harassment holds a news conference			1
her attorney , @entity8 , employs her studied grimace as @entity11 tells of an encounter 14 years ago that , if true , constitutes an unreported sexual assault			1
at his own press conference the next day , candidate @entity4 issues a heated denial , having earlier hinted at a willingness to take a lie detector test			1
how would the court system , @entity21 's formal arbiter of truth , evaluate the competing claims ? the courts would refuse to even consider them			1
in the legal world , courts scrupulously enforce statutes of limitations on accusations of improper or criminal conduct			1
the rules exist because it is unfair to force the accused to defend against a charge of ancient vintage			0
witness memories and evidence have grown stale and the courts believe that evidence is best evaluated and most reliable when it is fresh			2
the rare exceptions to this rule almost always involve the abuse of children and particularly heinous crimes like murder			0
the law provides no sanctuary for women who seek to resurrect sexual harassment claims from as distant as 14 years in the past			1
but @entity4 now exists in the realm of politics and not the courtroom			1
@entity4 must find a way to prove his innocence to a skeptical public regarding a suspiciously large number of claims for which the statute of limitations has long since expired			1
unfortunately , finding a path to the truth of sex harassment charges can often be a perilous journey			2
today , most professionals structure their interactions with employees of the opposite sex carefully to avoid even the hint of sexual impropriety			2
glass - walled office suites are the norm , insuring that employee relationships remain open to public view			2
the world of " @entity80 's " @entity77 and his blatantly sexual overtures to female employees is mostly a thing of the past			0
today 's sexual harassment is far more subtle			2
although legitimate claims deserve compensation , the sex harassment litigation story has a seedy underside			1
false complaints are sometimes rewarded with generous monetary awards and then hidden from public view with confidentiality agreements and sealing orders			1
employment lawyers are accustomed to meeting with ceo clients who are initially defiant and determined to resist a false claim of sexual harassment			1
they want their reputations and integrity preserved			0
but when a high - ranking executive is involved , the company rumor vine begins to grow			0
employees are pulled out of the workplace to back one side or the other			0
@entity110 reputations begin to bleed under the slash of a thousand paper cuts			0
and of course , the litigation process is expensive for the company			0
knowing this , experienced lawyers often urge even the innocent accused executive to agree to mediate claims informally and avoid the possibility of a very public and very embarrassing federal lawsuit			1
legitimate victims are also urged to settle rather than risk losing at trial			0
once mediation begins , the parties are told that public humiliation and legal costs can be avoided with a quiet , confidential settlement			0
both plaintiff and defendant are simultaneously silenced by the agreement 's penalty provisions			0
the truth of the claims will never be tested in any public forum			1
that is , unless the accused decides to run for public office			0
then it appears the art of the leak can undermine the solidity of even the most carefully drafted of confidentiality agreements			0
@entity4 said he never consented to the mediation process			1
the @entity147 , through its board , might have negotiated its own deal with the two women who made allegations of sexual misconduct against @entity4 to avoid bad publicity and legal costs			1
businesses will often " settle and seal " the case rather than endure the expense and embarrassment of defending even a falsely accused chief executive			0
based on the sketchy reported accounts , the initial case against @entity4 might have been paper - thin			1
there is no assertion of overt sexual contact between him and the female employees in question			0
the website @entity169 , which broke the story , refers to witness accounts of episodes of conversations filled with " innuendo " and of " physical gestures that were not overtly sexual " but which made female employees feel uncomfortable			0
no one who has followed @entity4 's astonishingly successful presidential campaign would be surprised to hear that he uses blunt language and gestures to express himself			1
the question of whether this blunt language constituted true sexual harassment may never be known			2
the claimant represented by attorney @entity185 , and recently identified as a federal government employee , has refused to go public despite the @entity147 's highly unusual decision to release her from the negotiated confidentiality agreement			0
the second and third women remain anonymous , while @entity11 surfaces with very old , never formally reported claims			2
in a court of law , @entity4 would clearly win			1
but in this case we are not litigating a claim but selecting a president			0
the @entity21 public , exercising its common sense about the character and integrity of this presidential candidate , will be the only and final judge of the facts of this case			0
given the secrecy of the sex harassment litigation process and the grave difficulty in determining the truth of old and moldy claims , it looks like a hung jury is the likely outcome			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .			2

@entity215 : the women accusing @entity4 relate encounters from years ago
the courts would *n't* hear these cases because of statute of limitations , he writes
harassment claims , true and false , often settled out of court to avoid bad publicity
@entity215 : @entity4 might win in court , but in politics , what matters is public judgment
