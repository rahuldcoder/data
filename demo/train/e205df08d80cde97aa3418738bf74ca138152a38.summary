-- when @entity2 testified via videotape in @entity5 's antitrust trial in 1998 , he was combative and defensive , as if he could n't believe how stupid the entire procedure was			1
he did n't expect the tape to be shown in court			0
it was , and it was a disaster			0
public opinion turned -- instead of a billionaire genius who had built @entity5 into the most valuable tech company in the world , he was a condescending monopolist who did n't have time for the legal system			1
amazingly , @entity2 did n't see it coming			2
as @entity5 co-founder @entity21 relates in his recent autobiography , the @entity24 sentiment " cut @entity19 to the core			0
" @entity2 told the media that government attorney @entity26 was " really out to destroy @entity5			2
" in his rational engineer 's mind , @entity5 was simply a winner			0
it had beaten its competitors by being smarter and working harder			0
it seemed deeply unfair for the government to build a case based on the complaints of those competitors and undo everything that @entity2 had worked so hard for			2
@entity37 is the new @entity5			2
it dominates its industry so completely that a few slight tweaks to its search engine can throw other companies into turmoil by burying them in search results			0
it 's using the incredible cash generated by that business to expand in a million different directions at once , from online video to social networking to mobile phones			1
the man running @entity37 , co-founder @entity51 , has a lot in common with @entity2			1
like @entity2 , @entity51 is often described in otherworldly terms , a near - genius with autistic tendencies like counting the seconds out loud while you 're explaining something too slowly to him			1
like @entity2 , he has run his own company for his entire adult life and has had uninterrupted success			1
like @entity2 , he has an engineer 's soul and is obsessive about cutting waste -- one of his first acts after taking over as ceo in april was to send an all - hands e-mail describing how to run meetings more efficiently			2
like @entity2 , he is hugely ambitious -- he once suggested that @entity37 hire a million engineers and told early investors that he saw @entity37 as a $ 100 billion company			1
that 's $ 100 billion in annual revenue , not just stock value			0
( it 's about one - third of the way there			0
) and like @entity2 , @entity51 may have a blind spot about the intersection of business and the @entity83			1
for instance , when @entity37 paid $ 3.2 billion to buy display ad firm @entity85 in 2007 , it got a search - engine marketing firm called @entity89 as part of the deal			2
obviously , @entity37 would have to let @entity89 go -- federal regulators would never let the dominant search company own a search marketing company			1
except @entity51 wanted to keep it , just to see how it worked			0
( @entity37 sold @entity89 to advertising conglomerate @entity97 in 2008			0
) back then , @entity51 had a tempering force in @entity99 , who was the company 's ceo and was originally brought in by its investors to provide " adult supervision			1
" but since @entity51 reclaimed the ceo title , the brakes are off			0
in his first five months , @entity51 has reorganized the company to his liking , cut a bunch of marginal projects like @entity110 and mobile app maker slide , launched a social network to compete with @entity113 and bid $ 12.5 billion to buy @entity115 's mobile phone business			1
now , antitrust investigators are circling @entity37 -- just like they did with @entity5			2
@entity117 has already launched a formal investigation , and the @entity119 is taking a close look as well			0
as @entity37 keeps expanding with big , bold moves , @entity51 will find himself thrust into the spotlight like he 's never been before			1
for @entity37 's sake , here 's hoping he handles it with more grace than @entity2			1
