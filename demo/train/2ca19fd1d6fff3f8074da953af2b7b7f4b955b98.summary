a year ago at the @entity2 , @entity0 achieved something not done in five years			1
he became the first man outside tennis ' " @entity8 " to win a major since @entity7 in 2009			1
the women 's champion was less surprising , in the form of the now retired @entity12			2
with this year 's opening grand slam starting monday , here are seven things to watch as the tennis season bursts into life			1
@entity19 's comeback if @entity19 wins in @entity20 , he might cherish his second title more than his first			1
that 's because after beating @entity23 in a thrilling five - set final in 2009 , @entity24 has been less than kind to the 14 - time grand slam champion on the health front			1
check out this list : in 2010 he retired with a knee injury , a year later he suffered a hamstring injury in his quarterfinal and last year a back problem surfaced while warming up for the final			2
it was the clear turning point and @entity0 took advantage			2
it was his long - time rival @entity23 who wept after losing to @entity19 in 2009 , but it was the @entity39 's turn to cry in 2014			1
@entity19 has n't competed at a grand slam since @entity41 , having skipped the @entity42 with a wrist complaint , and his buildup has been marred by two bad losses in the @entity46			1
but friday 's draw for 2015 's first major was kind to @entity19			1
he appears to have a smooth path to the semifinals			2
should @entity19 somehow be the last man standing , only two triumphs would separate him and 17 - time grand slam winner @entity23			1
@entity55 's quest for 19 if it was an odd - numbered year over the last decade , chances are that @entity55 won the @entity2			1
she took home the title in 2003 , 2005 , 2007 and 2009			2
but @entity55 ' recent appearances mirror @entity19 's			1
there was the ankle she hurt at a warm - up tournament in 2012 that led to a fourth - round exit in @entity20			1
in 2013 a back injury was probably to blame for a quarterfinal loss and last year the back flared up again in the quarterfinals			2
@entity55 ' play early in 2015 is sure to have worried her fans , too			1
the 18 - time grand slam singles winner complained of a lack of energy at the @entity75 in @entity76 and subsequently split two of her four singles matches			1
like @entity19 , @entity55 ' longest grand slam drought now happens to be in @entity20			1
she won the @entity42 in september by topping her bff , @entity81 , but they ca n't face off in the @entity2 final since they 're in the same quarter			1
@entity23 's bid for one more major with @entity19 's performances patchy , world no. 1 @entity85 getting off to a less than stellar start in 2015 and @entity88 struggling for grand slam form , the 33 - year - old @entity23 ca n't be discarded			1
while @entity23 did n't have to face any of his fellow " @entity8 " members as he shone in @entity92 -- where he collected his 1,000th match win -- he defeated two players thought of as outside grand slam contenders in 2015			1
he dispatched @entity97 in the final having routed @entity98 in the semifinals			0
aiding @entity23 would have been a kind draw , but unfortunately for him , it did n't happen			1
he found himself in the same quarter as @entity88 and same half as @entity19			1
@entity102 and the @entity103 can the " @entity103 " propel @entity102 to glory ? although she showed flashes in 2013 , last year in @entity20 was when the tennis world truly took note of the 20 - year - old			1
her semifinal showing was n't an anomaly , with @entity102 then reaching the last four at the @entity112 and the final at @entity41			0
but @entity102 could n't duplicate her success from august onwards , the low point perhaps coming at the year - end championships where she failed to win a set in her three matches			2
fatigue no doubt played a role			0
@entity102 arrives in @entity20 this year without a permanent coach , and you wonder how high her confidence is			1
the return of @entity7 only the @entity125 would n't be happy that @entity7 is back playing tennis			0
skipping most of last year with further wrist troubles , his supporters must have been holding their breath when the @entity130 pulled out of @entity92			0
but he returned in @entity131 this week -- unsure of how his left wrist would cope -- and made the quarterfinals			0
the pain has n't gone away yet , he said			0
none of the contenders would want to face del @entity7 early , though only the very optimistic would suggest he could win a second major over the coming fortnight			2
maybe claiming a few rounds and coming through the tournament unscathed would be enough for him			0
he does n't face a top - 10 player in his opener but it 's still an enticing -- and imposing -- encounter			0
the 6 - foot - 6 " @entity143 " plays 2013 @entity41 semifinalist @entity144 , who stands 6 - foot - 8			0
@entity146 's opening major ? in an era where players on the women 's tour all seem to be towering 6 - footers , @entity146 -- 5 - foot - 6 -- is an exception			2
she still packs a punch from the baseline , but it 's her use of angles that so often gets her into winning positions in rallies			0
her backhand is one of the best around			0
if @entity146 's breakthrough was in 2013 , she went one better last year by making the difficult jump into the top 10 and top five			0
how close was the @entity165 to winning the @entity112 ? very			0
she extended one of the game 's top competitors , @entity170 , to 6 - 4 in the third set of the final			0
@entity146 -- the most clicked on player on the @entity175 's website last year -- began this year with a title in @entity177			0
a high - profile home hope who is the top @entity181 hope ? the rankings will tell you it 's @entity185 , who like @entity7 is a @entity42 winner			0
she 's the world no. 20 on the women 's tour			0
but @entity185 has never really flourished at the @entity2 , and she has n't been shy to admit that nerves have been a huge factor			2
only once since 2007 has @entity185 -- armed with arguably the best second serve in the women 's game -- exceeded the third round			0
@entity181 are probably banking on @entity195 , the athletic 19 - year - old who stunned @entity19 at @entity41 , to have an extended run			2
@entity195 chose to take a break in september , saying he was " burnt out , " and injuries have crept up			0
he missed the @entity75 with a sore back			0
so expecting too much from @entity195 may be a mistake .			0

the @entity2 starts monday in @entity20
@entity19 makes his grand slam comeback
@entity55 seeks a 19th career major
@entity23 enters with *momentum* after 1,000th win
