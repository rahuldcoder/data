-- the case of the first toddler ever to be " functionally cured " of @entity7 could have wide - ranging effects on the global fight to end the @entity4 epidemic			1
" if we can replicate this in other infants ... this has huge implications for the burden of infection that 's occurring globally , " said dr. @entity8 , a pediatrician at the @entity9			1
@entity8 is the lead author of a report on the toddler 's case that was presented at the 2013 @entity19 in @entity20 on monday			2
" for the unfortunate ones who do get infected , if this can be replicated , this would offer real hope of clearing the virus			0
" some 1,000 infants are born with @entity7 every day , according to the latest estimates from the @entity29			1
that means some 330,000 children are living with the deadly virus			0
the majority of these infections are in the developing world			0
the most common way children get @entity7 is through perinatal transmission -- @entity7 transmission from an infected mother to a child while she is pregnant , giving birth or when she breast - feeds the child			1
the number of infant infections in the @entity46 has gone down some 90 % since the mid- ' 90s , according to the @entity47 ; that 's in large part because pregnant women are routinely tested			1
when a mother is identified as being @entity7 positive , her doctor is then able to administer preventive interventions that will , in most cases , keep the virus in check			1
in developing countries , infants born to mothers with @entity7 are not so lucky			1
there , mothers are less likely to be treated with antiretroviral drugs that would prevent transmission during pregnancy			0
in @entity66 and the @entity67 , for instance , 3 % of pregnant women with @entity7 received antiretroviral medications , according to the @entity70 report			1
some 23 % in @entity71 and @entity72 did			2
testing is also less sophisticated in these areas			0
the unidentified @entity76 woman in this case had no prenatal care and was not diagnosed as hiv positive until just before she delivered the baby			2
that 's why dr. @entity82 , an associate professor of pediatrics at the @entity84 , administered the drugs within 30 hours after the baby was born			1
typically , a baby born to a woman with @entity7 would be given two drugs as a prophylactic measure			1
@entity82 said her standard is to use a three - drug regimen to treat an infection			1
she did this on the @entity76 infant without waiting for test results to confirm the baby was infected with @entity7			2
gay thinks the timing may be key , that the timing may deserve " more emphasis than the particular drugs or number of drugs used			0
timeline : @entity4 moments to remember " we are hoping that future studies will show that very early institution of effective therapy will result in this same outcome consistently , " she said			0
doctors will try to replicate the success of her case and see if aggressive treatment right after birth can " cure , " or if this is an anomaly			0
" we are enthusiastic about the potential of this case , but it is one case and it needs to be replicated and confirmed through future studies and clinical trials , " said dr. @entity119 , the @entity120 of hiv / aids coordinator of treatment and care			0
" we will not be changing any of our current guidance in this case , but we will continue to watch for new information and provide updates to our prevention of mother to child transmission ( @entity136 ) and early infant diagnosis guidance as necessary			1
" antiretroviral medications are pricey for people in the developing world , but treating a child for a year or two with these drugs would be a lot cheaper than paying for a lifetime of treatment after infection			2
why youths are n't getting tested for hiv @entity8 is optimistic			0
if the result of this case can be repeated , she believes this discovery could make a huge difference internationally			2
" in resource - limited settings , this kind of treatment would not be a stretch			0
we know how to do this and we have the infrastructure in place to deliver this kind of care			0

how *quickly* antiretrovirals were administered in this case may have made a difference
mother - child infection rates are down 90 % in the @entity46 since the mid- ' 90s
some 1,000 infants are born with @entity7 every day , according to the @entity70
