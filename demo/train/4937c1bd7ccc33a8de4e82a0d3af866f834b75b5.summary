-- it began by accident			2
my girlfriend , @entity5 , and her twin sister , @entity6 , rented a documentary on panda bears			2
then we went online and found videos of tourists , somewhere in @entity12 , embracing pandas			1
one showed a gaggle of cubs eagerly descending a slide in what looked like panda day care			1
" we have to find this place , " @entity5 said , eyes lighting up			0
hugging baby pandas costs about $ 130 and the pandas are even cuter in person than you would imagine a friend of a friend had recently gone to @entity12 on a botanical excursion , and i could see the wheels turning in @entity5 's and @entity6 's heads			1
soon enough , we had tickets and immunization appointments			0
much in the same way you might say , " hey , let 's go to a movie , " we made plans to cross the @entity39			1
we had no basis to believe that meeting pandas was possible for ordinary people			1
we consulted guidebooks and online travel forums , and our best bet appeared to be a facility for research and visitors at the @entity49 , about five hours away from @entity50 in @entity52 province			1
because it was difficult to reach , we figured it must be more rewarding			0
once in @entity56 , i contracted a fixer on the mainland to help sort everything out			0
his name was @entity62 , and he 'd been to @entity49 earlier that year with @entity63			1
ever since empress @entity65 sent a pair of panda bears to the @entity69 emperor around a.d. 700 , @entity12 's public face has been represented by the furry goodwill ambassadors , who even forced a smile from @entity72			1
today , we noticed upon arrival in @entity75 , you do n't see dour @entity76 nearly as much as @entity77 , the flower - crowned cartoon panda that 's one of the @entity81 mascots , and just the first in the parade of pandas that adorn @entity12 's storefronts , advertising , clothing , and vibrant cell - phone - charm industry			1
in @entity50 , we were greeted at the airport by a 40 - foot column topped with a giant bronze panda			0
on our way into the city , we also could n't help but notice that the lampposts , rickshaws , and even highway overpasses were festooned or stenciled or otherwise decorated with pandas			1
but @entity50 was just a transit point for our trek along the @entity100 and @entity101 to the @entity49			0
we hired a driver , part of a fairly dodgy tour we 'd found last - minute on the @entity105			0
all road travel in @entity12 happens frenetically -- the constant , aggressive brinksmanship of millions of shoddy minivans with toy - like wheels			0
we left for @entity49 at dusk , ascending steep gorges that sometimes disappeared into the mist , on roads that sometimes disappeared altogether			0
there 's no real town , and not many restaurants , other than the shabby ones at the @entity118 and the @entity119			1
the following day , we awoke to a crisp and cool autumn day , with the sound of the river filling the narrow valley			0
this is the panda 's native habitat , a subalpine arboreal wonderland that makes you understand @entity12 fairy tales			1
the @entity129 for the @entity130 has marked off large enclosures for its several dozen pandas			1
last summer , the notoriously fickle pandas produced 18 cubs			1
we could see some of them through the glass of the nursery			0
the newest born were tiny pink nubs			0
those slightly older were fed with bottles			0
the cubs we had seen online were from the previous summer			1
a little over a year old , all 16 played together in a single enclosure next to the nursery			1
three @entity69 girls entered the day - care center and frolicked among the cubs			1
" how can we do that ? " i asked @entity148 , one of the keepers			0
he took us to an office , where we discovered advance work to arrange a special panda visit is unnecessary			0
to hug baby pandas , all you have to do is show up and pay the @entity155 $ 130 per person			1
that 's nothing for five minutes of nirvana			1
in the flesh , the cubs were so unbelievably cute that they seemed artificial			2
with their round heads , big eyes , and rolling gait , they looked and acted like @entity167 creations			0
touching one felt like meeting a unicorn			0
the cubs moved like puppies in a curious , playful swarm			2
they did n't lick so much as nuzzle			0
and grab : to our delight , the desire for hugging was mutual , and what began as a careful encounter quickly devolved into fuzzy mayhem as the cubs attached themselves to our arms and legs			2
at one point , @entity5 was dragged to the ground by a clutch of cubs , and she beamed beatifically			2
" i ca n't believe this is happening , " she said as she freed herself , only to be taken down again			0
after the staff pulled the cubs off us , we stood around in a daze			2
stepping back outside of the panda pen , @entity5 stopped grinning long enough to say , " i want to do that again			2
" round - trip airfare between @entity50 and @entity195 , @entity56 , or @entity75 runs $ 400 to $ 680 on @entity196 or @entity197			2
