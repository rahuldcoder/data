-- most artists have to wait years -- or perhaps an eternity -- to earn serious money from their work			0
@entity6 , on the other hand , earned more than $ 83,000 in a few weeks , and he 's only 5			1
@entity6 's art is of monsters -- green ones , black ones , scary ones , silly ones			1
the people who buy his drawings are n't necessarily art lovers or monster lovers			2
they just want to help @entity6 , whose leukemia was diagnosed three months ago , and whose parents nearly had to sell their house because of the financial difficulties of dealing with cancer			1
when @entity6 's family started selling his drawings online in early october , his parents thought they 'd sell a few each week			1
they never imagined it could more than make up for the income they were losing because @entity6 's father , @entity27 , had to take unpaid time off to be with @entity6 during treatments			1
" we were in the hospital with @entity6 , and my husband and i were talking about selling the house , which i did n't want to do			1
i was really upset , " said his mother , @entity34			0
" while we were there , we found out we 'd sold over 2,000 drawings			2
i just fell down crying			0
i knew we 'd finally be ok			0
" " he 's a great artist , but i never thought he 'd be famous at 5 , " adds @entity6 , who lives in @entity38 , @entity39 , and gave birth to @entity6 's little brother , @entity41 , just 12 days after @entity6 's cancer diagnosis			1
an aunt 's love the idea for selling @entity6 's artwork came from his father 's sister , @entity48 , who lives in @entity50 , @entity51 , and was trying to think of a way to help from afar			1
she had to look no further than her newborn son 's nursery for answers			2
a few months before he got sick , @entity6 had sent her some of his drawings to decorate his cousin 's room			1
" i 'd sold items i 've made on @entity60 -- purses , bags , clothes -- and i thought we could sell @entity6 's drawings there , too , " she says			1
@entity48 opened up a shop , @entity68 , on the popular website			0
" when i first mentioned it to my brother , he thought it was crazy , " she adds			0
" but i thought we could sell 60 by @entity74			2
" instead , she sold nearly 7,000 by @entity74 for $ 12 a piece			1
she says sales really took off when a friend of hers convinced a website called @entity80 , which usually pokes fun of the products on @entity60 , to promote sales of @entity6 's drawings			1
now selling @entity6 's art has become a full - time job , in addition to taking care of her baby			1
" i print , package , ship and answer e-mails from home , " she says			0
" upstairs is the printing department , downstairs is the shipping department , and wherever i am is the pr department			0
" @entity48 says she knows why @entity6 's drawings are selling so phenomenally well			1
" people really want to help , " @entity48 says			0
" they say @entity6 's story really touches them			1
" @entity6 's story @entity6 was a healthy 5 - year - old until late this past summer when he started having fevers that would n't go away , no matter how many medicines his pediatrician prescribed			1
then on the weekend of september 10 , he developed a terrible cough , and his parents noticed bruises on his body			0
" usually @entity6 tells us if he 's hurt himself or run into something , but he could n't explain these bruises at all , " @entity6 says			1
the @entity112 took @entity6 to the pediatrician 's office that monday , and blood tests confirmed the worst : @entity6 had leukemia			1
he started treatment the next day at @entity118 in @entity119 , @entity39 , receiving several rounds of chemotherapy			0
@entity27 works for @entity123 training factory workers , and his insurance is good			0
while the family is responsible for a $ 250 co-payment when @entity6 goes to the hospital , most of the rest of his care is covered			1
what set them back financially is that @entity27 has had to take unpaid time off work			0
his wife stays at home with @entity6 and his baby brother , so the family had to go without any income			1
" we were buying cheaper groceries and cutting way back on clothes , and we 're not big shoppers to begin with , " @entity34 says			0
" the money from the drawings really relieved us			2
when insurance is n't enough @entity6 says she never imagined how expensive an illness could be even when you do have good insurance			2
" if i were to see this story , i would think to myself , ' these people have insurance			0
what are they talking about ? ' " @entity6 says			2
in addition to her husband 's lost wages , the family has had other expenses , such as buying food at the hospital instead of cooking at home			1
the @entity112 ' situation is n't unusual , says @entity164 , director of communications for @entity165 , an organization that helps people affected by cancer			0
" cancer is an incredibly expensive disease , " @entity168 says			0
" and no one budgets to have cancer			0
" there are lost wages , which the @entity112 faced , as well as transportation costs to and from the hospital			1
plus , even good insurance does n't cover all the costs			0
" you can get socked at the pharmacy for $ 900 a month , or even $ 3,000 a month , and that 's with insurance , " @entity168 says			2
families have become clever about how to raise money , she adds			0
for example , parents of one child with cancer held a " pie - a - thon , " cooking pies for 48 hours straight and selling them			0
for help facing the financial burdens of cancer , contact @entity165 or the @entity195			0
and a previous @entity197 column also offered advice : after cancer diagnosis , what comes next ? @entity168 urges patients and their families who are having fundraisers to beware of the taxman : if you raise a lot of money , you could get pushed into a higher income bracket and face higher taxes			2
to learn more about smart fundraising , see page 3 of this guide from the @entity213			0
@entity6 's future the @entity112 are right now trying to figure out now how much of their income from the drawings is taxable			1
some of it they 've used to pay their mortgage and other expenses , but some has also been used for art supplies for @entity6			1
@entity48 says sales are still going strong even though she 's told customers that for the time being the family is fine			2
money from future sales will be put away for later			0
@entity27 is back at work but takes unpaid time off when @entity6 has a doctor 's appointment			1
" he gets a spinal tap every three weeks , and those are not good to go through , " @entity34 says			0
" i ca n't emotionally handle it			0
i always have to leave the room , so @entity27 's the one who stays strong for him and holds his hand			2
" she says the response to @entity6 's drawings has helped her emotionally , not just financially			1
" i love reading the happy stories people leave on @entity6 's blog about how they 've been through this , and it does get better , " she says			1
" it 's really helped me stay positive through all this because i was really depressed seeing my child have to go through all this not knowing whether he 'd make it or not			2
" as for @entity6 , he keeps drawing , sometimes for hours a day , even when he 's in the hospital			1
he recently started to draw jesters ( " he loves the hats and the bells , " his mother says ) , and he 's asked @entity258 for a four - faced clown mask he saw online for @entity260			2
still , monsters are his main theme			2
" i do n't think he realizes it , but monsters have become iconic for him , " she says			0
" i think he likes them because he 's fighting a monster inside himself			0
