@entity0 -- the so - called " lame duck " session of the @entity14 @entity13 convened monday , with members preparing to make decisions on a host of contentious issues that could have major political ramifications for both president @entity7 and the incoming @entity10 @entity9 majority			1
newly elected @entity9 members , meanwhile , were given a daylong orientation on the rules and procedures governing life on @entity20			1
they are set to take office in january			0
in the @entity23 , two new members -- @entity25 's @entity24 and @entity27 's @entity26 -- were sworn in by vice president @entity28			2
@entity24 and @entity26 are both @entity29 ; their addition to the @entity23 did not change the chamber 's 59 - 41 @entity14 edge for the lame duck session			1
@entity29 will have a smaller 53 to 47 majority next year			1
@entity26 was elected to fill the final two years of the late sen. @entity36 's term			2
@entity24 will serve the final four years of @entity28 's term			0
one of the first challenges for the @entity9 is the selection of its new leadership			1
republicans are expected to tap @entity43 rep. @entity42 and @entity27 rep. @entity44 as speaker and majority leader , respectively			2
democrats appear ready to tap current house speaker @entity48 of @entity49 as the new minority leader , while also keeping @entity52 rep. @entity51 and @entity54 rep. @entity53 in the leadership			1
but @entity57 rep. @entity56 , a more conservative @entity58 , appears ready to challenge @entity48 if she does n't step down			0
@entity10 senators face a tough vote tuesday on whether to ban earmarks , a policy @entity62 already have in place and are expected to keep in the new @entity13			1
the idea of prohibiting members from designating funding for specific projects in their states or districts is popular with reform - minded deficit hawks but opposed by congressional veterans trying to steer funds to constituencies back home			1
senate minority leader @entity76 , @entity77 , a longtime defender of earmarks , announced monday that he intends to vote for the ban when the @entity10 @entity23 caucus meets tuesday			1
" i 'm not wild about turning over more spending authority to the executive branch , but i have come to share the view of most @entity87 that our nation is at a crossroads , " @entity82 said on the @entity23 floor			0
the " only way we will be able to turn the corner and save our future is if elected leaders like me make the kinds of difficult decisions voters are clearly asking us to make			2
" @entity7 responded with a statement welcoming @entity82 's " decision to join me and members of both parties who support cracking down on wasteful earmark spending , which we ca n't afford during these tough economic times			1
" but , the president added , " we ca n't stop with earmarks as they represent only part of the problem			0
" @entity7 may weigh in more on thursday , when he is scheduled to meet with the bipartisan congressional leadership at the @entity9			1
at the top of the agenda : whether to extend the @entity114 tax cuts for families making more than $ 250,000			0
@entity10 contend that failure to extend the cuts for everyone would be a mistake in a weak economy			0
@entity7 considers such a move a roughly $ 700 billion budget - busting mistake , but recently suggested he 's willing to compromise			0
if @entity13 fails to act , all the cuts will expire at the end of the year			1
in addition to the tax cuts , the lame duck @entity13 also has to consider expiring cuts in the estate tax			1
if @entity13 fails to act , the estate tax rate -- currently zero -- will return to 55 percent on assets over $ 1 million			2
one bipartisan @entity23 proposal would cap the tax at 35 percent on assets over $ 3.5 million , but serious negotiations have not begun , according to aides from both parties			0
@entity13 must also decide what to do about a bill that is keeping the government running but is set to expire december 3			1
@entity9 @entity10 want a nearly yearlong extension , but with funding cut to 2008 levels			2
democrats are resisting , though some @entity14 senators appear to be open to some reductions			0
also on the agenda : a possible repeal of the military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy barring gays and lesbians from serving openly in the armed forces			0
the repeal is attached to an annual defense authorization bill			0
there is still significant opposition in the @entity10 caucus to lifting the ban , raising doubt about whether the defense bill will come up for a final vote this year			2
the @entity23 must also take up ratification of the nuclear arms reduction treaty with @entity165 , a long - stalled food safety measure , an extension of unemployment benefits for the long - term jobless and funding for the settlement of a discrimination suit by black farmers			0
at the same time , @entity9 @entity29 are pushing a measure to give @entity176 recipients a $ 250 payment to make up for not getting a cost - of - living adjustment this year because inflation is low			1
they 're also trying to pass a child nutrition bill backed by first lady @entity181 and the @entity182 , which would create a path to citizenship for young illegal immigrants if they attend college or serve in the military			0
@entity13 is also slated to consider adjustments to the @entity189 and another extension of the so - called " doc - fix , " preventing reimbursement cuts to doctors treating @entity195 patients			2
hanging over all the deliberations of the lame duck session : the enormous pressure to cut spending being brought to bear by the incoming conservative group of congressmen			1
" i 'm certainly going to come up here and do the things that the people elected me to do , and that is get this out of control spending under control , " @entity203 - elect @entity202 told @entity1			2
" we 're going to be in bad , bad trouble if we do n't get some of this under control , and i 'm not afraid to make the tough votes			0
" @entity216 , a newly elected @entity217 @entity10 , also repeated the campaign mantra of pushing for a smaller government			1
" as the federal government has expanded , small businesses and communities around this country have constricted , " he said			0
" and that 's not a trend that i think should continue			0
" @entity1 's @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 and @entity230 contributed to this report			0
