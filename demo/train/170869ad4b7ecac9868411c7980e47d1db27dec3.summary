-- if you were never able to solve a @entity2 without peeling off the stickers or prying it apart with a butter knife , you 're really going to hate this robot			1
@entity7 3 , a robot built with @entity9 and powered by a smartphone , shattered its predecessor 's record over the weekend , solving the iconic ' 80s puzzle in just over 3.25 seconds			1
the lightning - quick feat , pulled off saturday at the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , shaved more than two seconds off the former @entity19 - recognized world record of 5.27 seconds , accomplished by the same team 's @entity7			1
that mark narrowly bested the best human time of 5.5 seconds , set by @entity23 of the @entity24 last year			1
" we knew @entity30 had the potential to beat the existing record , but with the robot performing physical operations quicker than the human eye can see , there 's always an element of risk , " said @entity25 , who built the robots along with co-inventor @entity27			2
@entity25 is an engineer with @entity39 , the company that makes the souped - up processors in the @entity41 used to power @entity7 3			1
the phone analyzes the cube and calculates the best sequence of moves to solve it , then instructs the robot 's four arms to get to work			0
eight @entity51 bricks perform motor control and sequencing on the robot			2
" in the end , the hours we spent perfecting the robot and ensuring its motor and intelligence functions were properly synchronized paid off , " @entity25 said			0
" our big challenge now is working out if it 's possible to make it go even faster			0
" the cube , originally called the @entity2 , was invented in 1974 by @entity64 , a @entity65 architect			2
it is believed to be the best - selling toy of all time , with more than 350 million cubes sold since it was launched internationally in 1980			0
according to its makers , any permutation can be solved in 20 moves or fewer			0
while they were at it , @entity25 also set a couple of other @entity2 records over the weekend			0
another robot solved a 4 - by - 4 cube ( the regular @entity64 's is 3 - by - 3 ) in just over 1 minute , 18 seconds , and an intricate 9 - by - 9 cube became the biggest ever to be solved by a robot , with another machine sorting it in just over 34 minutes .			1

smartphone - powered @entity51 robot sets @entity2 record
@entity7 3 sorted the *famous* puzzle in 3.25 seconds
the fastest human time , recorded last year , is 5.5 seconds
