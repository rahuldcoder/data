@entity0 , @entity1 -- a frenzy of diplomatic activity was underway around the tense @entity6 peninsula thursday , with @entity6 leader @entity7 reportedly traveling through @entity8 , former @entity10 president @entity9 visiting @entity11 , and the @entity8 envoy to six - party denuclearization talks landing in @entity0			1
" we detected @entity7 's train heading towards @entity8 , over the border , at midnight wednesday , " a source at @entity1 's presidential office said			1
" we assume that @entity7 is aboard the train , and are trying to find out his destination and the purpose of his visit			2
" as is common with the secretive state , the visit was unannounced and no agenda has been released			0
@entity8 's @entity26 did not respond to questions regarding @entity7 's visit			1
the @entity29 in @entity30 said it had no information regarding the visit			0
the alleged movement is taking place amid speculation that the ailing @entity7 , 68 , who is believed to have suffered a stroke two years ago , is preparing to officially announce his son , @entity37 , as his successor			2
meanwhile , @entity9 arrived in @entity11 wednesday on a humanitarian mission to negotiate the release of @entity10 citizen @entity41 , believed to be a @entity43 activist , who is currently imprisoned in the country after entering it illegally in january			1
@entity9 was greeted by @entity46 , @entity6 's chief negotiator at the six - party nuclear talks , and has also met the country 's titular head of state , @entity49 , according to @entity0 's @entity51 , quoting @entity6 media			1
there have been hopes of some breakthrough in tense @entity11 - @entity57 relations with @entity9 's visit			1
@entity9 's 1994 talks with the @entity60 , @entity7 's father , paved the way for the " @entity62 " the same year , an agreement designed to reign in @entity11 's nuclear ambitions			1
also on thursday in @entity0 , @entity64 , vice foreign minister and special representative on @entity68 affairs of @entity8 , was in @entity0 for talks with @entity71 sung - lac			1
the two men are their country 's respective envoys in the currently stalled six - party talks that aim to denuclearize the @entity75			0
these events come amid intense speculation surrounding @entity6 's leadership , given that the state will be holding only its third - ever @entity80 in september			0
" the last @entity80 was in 1966 , an enormously important year in @entity6 ideology , as that was when their cultural revolution started , when the personality cult went up a huge notch , " said @entity81 , a @entity6 propaganda expert and author of @entity84			0
" if that is anything to go by , this congress has to be something big			0
" experts do not , however , expect @entity7 to place his son before the @entity30 leadership , and suggested that a @entity8 trip is more likely to be economically motivated			1
@entity6 is facing sanctions pressure following a string of nuclear tests , missile launches and , most recently , the sinking of a @entity1 warship in march -- which @entity0 accuses @entity11 of carrying out -- meaning @entity7 could be going cap - in - hand			1
" @entity7 , i think , would be looking primarily for expressions of economic support and political support , " added @entity106 , author of meltdown : the @entity111 of the @entity112			2
" he needs @entity8 help to keep his economy afloat and the @entity8 remain @entity6 's best friend " but if @entity7 is , indeed , in @entity8 , hopes of an easing in @entity57 - @entity11 tensions are lowered			1
" @entity9 is in to get @entity41 out , not to try and restart something , " said @entity119 , a security expert at @entity0 's @entity120			2
" if @entity7 is not there , @entity9 will not be able to meet the top leader , ask questions , interact and get the atmospherics ; he can meet @entity46 and @entity49 , but they are not the center of power			2
" with @entity9 being greeted by @entity46 in @entity11 , and with @entity64 visiting @entity0 , there may be a desire by @entity11 and / or @entity30 to restart stalled denuclearization talks			1
" as we understand , ambassador @entity64 visited @entity6 recently , so i think he will explain what he heard in @entity6 and deliver the @entity8 view on the resumption of the six - party talks , " said a @entity0 @entity132 official			2
while the 1994 " @entity62 " fell apart soon after the @entity139 administration accused @entity11 of a secret atomic arms program in 2002 , @entity30 has invested considerable credibility in sponsoring the six - party talks , designed to denuclearize the @entity75			2
but the talks , which started in 2003 , have made little progress : @entity6 has undertaken two nuclear tests and talks themselves have been in abeyance since 2007			0
@entity8 has railed against @entity10 and @entity1 naval exercises held in the eastern @entity149 following the sinking of the @entity1 corvette @entity152 in march , perhaps explaining why @entity30 wishes for a resumption of dialogue at this time			0
" i think @entity30 would like to contain any further escalation of military exercises generated as a result of the @entity152 incident , " said @entity120 's @entity7			0
" it is not in their interest to have a further tightening of the @entity10 - @entity1 - @entity164 alliance			0
" @entity1 , however , may be less willing to resume talks , given the talks ' history , and given current public anger over the @entity152 , in which 46 sailors died			0
" people i speak to in @entity1 say they are not in the mood to return to the table unless there is some kind of apology for the sinking of the @entity152 and some clear signs of a serious implementation of denuclearization commitments , " said @entity170 , of the @entity172 's @entity0 office			0
" if you are @entity30 , how can you demonstrate that @entity6 is going to return to the table to bargain in good faith ? " @entity2 's @entity186 contributed to this story			0
