a coalition of organizations established the @entity12 this month to conserve species threatened by deadly fungus , habitat loss , pollution , pesticides and climate change			1
the scientists said amphibians are the world 's most threatened group of animals			1
though they thrived on @entity24 for more than 360 million years , one in three of the 6,000 recognized amphibian species are now at risk of extinction and as many as 122 species have gone extinct since 1980 , according to the @entity30 's amphibian specialist group			1
" the world 's amphibians are facing an uphill battle for survival , " said @entity31 of @entity32 , co-chairman of the group			2

" amphibians have so much to offer humans , " said amphibian specialist @entity52			0
" many have an arsenal of compounds stored in their skin that have the potential to address a multitude of human diseases			0
" but as amphibians die out , so do opportunities to develop new medicines , he said			0
the southern gastric brooding frog , for instance , could have led to the development of a treatment for human peptic ulcers had it not gone extinct , @entity52 said			1
" we simply can not afford to let this current amphibian extinction crisis go unchecked , " he said			2
@entity73 , who began documenting amphibian declines two decades ago , said the loss of species was part of an overall biodiversity crisis			2
" amphibians seem to have been hit the hardest of all vertebrate species , " said @entity73 , a professor of zoology at @entity80			0
" the long - term ecological repercussions of their decline could be profound , and we have to do something about it			0
