-- which star do you most associate with car - chase movies : @entity5 or @entity6 ? @entity7 or @entity8 ? @entity9 , star of the @entity11 film " @entity12 , " poses on an @entity14 car in 2002			1
although most car - chase movies pack some serious @entity18 talent , we like to think that in many cases the real star in this particular movie genre is the car : from @entity5 's super-tight @entity23 in " @entity24 " to the stripped - down @entity25 in @entity27 's " @entity26			1
" but which movie has the best car - chase scene in history ? we take a look			1
" @entity32 " ( 1981 ) almost everyone knows that @entity35 's cheesy celebration of @entity37 's intercoastal car culture is one big car chase involving spectacular cars , including a @entity40 , an @entity14 and a gorgeous opening sequence where a @entity42 makes short work of a @entity45 police cruiser			1
but perhaps less well known is the original coast - to - coast sprint run undertaken by speed racer @entity47 in 1914			0
the 11 - day drive made his name in the @entity52 , who forever associated him with the @entity55 steam train christened " the @entity56			0
" trivia : the ambulance driven in the movie by @entity8 and sidekick @entity60 was a modified @entity61 used by @entity63 editor @entity62 when he tried to resurrect the famous race in the 1970s , as part of a protest against the onset of 55 mph speeding limits nationwide			0
" @entity26 " ( 2007 ) @entity27 continues to push the limits of speed and taste in " @entity26			0
" the film is a stock car - and violence - infused tale that features for a quarter of its run - time a fantastic chase sequence involving a stripped down bad - ass 1969 @entity25 and a heavily modified 1970 @entity78 with a girl -- actress and former stuntwoman @entity81 -- splayed on its hood			1
apparently , @entity27 came upon the idea for a " death proof " car after filming the car - crash scene in @entity86 and telling a friend he wanted to buy a @entity89 for safety reasons			1
@entity92 autos : 2009 @entity25 the friend informed him that a decent movie stunt team could easily " death proof " any car for him			1
hence was born the " @entity26 " movie concept			0
does n't that name still give you chills ? 8			0
" @entity102 " ( 2001 ) car chases ostensibly over a half mile , otherwise known as street racing , received attention when " the @entity111 " lifted the lid on a high - adrenaline tokyo drift racing scene that burgeoned in popularity in @entity110 and the @entity37 in the late 1990s			2
the movie explored the phenomenon through a fictional world of ultra-hip hijackers who used heavily modified @entity110 cars to steal high - end electronic components			0
it 's a cops and criminals yarn with a high - octane twist that features some seriously customized old - school cars including a @entity123 , @entity124 and a @entity125 -- though if you look closely , a retro @entity25 also features , too			2
@entity92 autos : @entity123 @entity129 drift racing , where drivers work in teams while skidding all four wheels around a tight circuit , now features at many events on the @entity136 circuit , catching a tailwind from the movie 's popularity			2
look out for the new " @entity111 " film soon			0
" @entity141 : @entity141 " ( 1981 ) you 'd be hard pressed to name any of @entity144 's cobbled - together vehicles in his 1981 sequel to " @entity146 " -- which may boast the highest number of chopped and recharged @entity148 outside of @entity149 , @entity150 -- but that does n't stop " @entity141 " being considered a car - chase classic and one of the best action movies out there			1
motley collections of cut - throat bandits , nomads and braggarts populate @entity161 's barren , dystopian landscape and blow - up any number of heavy machines , including police cars , motorbikes and a big - rig fuel tanker			0
it 's all in their quest for that all - important and -- in a post-apocalyptic world -- rare substance : fuel			0
the explosive 20 - minute chase scene to end the movie still exhilarates nearly 30 years after the movie 's release			2
and do n't we all want an engine intake like @entity180 's infamous " blower ? " 6			0
" @entity181 " ( 1971 ) a @entity183 / @entity182 gives you some serious leverage when you 're involved in a bump - and - run two - car contest on a one - track road in the middle of the @entity190 west -- and it 's the only road out of the desert heat			1
@entity92 autos : @entity78 @entity194 , a renegade @entity196 , used five separate first - generation challengers , including the 375 - horsepower @entity198 , to full effect in forcing numerous hapless drivers off the road on the hazard - ridden 15 - hour sprint from @entity203 , @entity204 , to @entity205 , @entity206 , as he 's pursued by cops , racers and bandits alike			2
@entity78 released its highly anticipated and heavily retrofitted @entity78 update in 2008 , with the film 's cult following no doubt waiting patiently for any word on a commemorative " @entity181 " model			0
" @entity216 " ( 1974 ) we 're not talking about the remake starring @entity219 and @entity220 , which boasts some pretty spectacular car - chase sequences itself , but the 1974 original that features a 34 - minute chase sequence over the @entity226 , @entity206 , ports complex that some consider the best ever captured on celluloid			1
a mediocre cast and stilted dialog may put off many , but the film that centers around a group of car thieves and their bid to steal 48 cars over a couple of days accomplishes what it set out to do : @entity240 viewers in movie theaters and destroy as many cars as possible ( in this case , 93 )			2
an amazing collection of @entity246 , @entity247 and @entity248 limos make up the list that car thief @entity9 " @entity250 -- who did all his own stunts -- is given to steal for a @entity190 drug lord			0
few , though , compare to the film 's famous 1973 @entity253 1 , christened " @entity255 " and driven by @entity250			0
" @entity256 " ( 1971 ) @entity7 bumping and weaving his way around the intersection of @entity259 and 86th @entity260 , @entity261 , while pursuing a bandit on a subway train offers to this day a fantastic driver 's eye perspective of driving through @entity266 at rush hour			1
but the chase featuring a 1971 @entity270 remains a classic as a result of its impromptu crashes that were n't supposed to be part of the action but were left in the sequence after several stunt drivers mistimed their entrance into the car chase , striking @entity7 's car instead of narrowly avoiding it as he chases a train - bound drug dealer			1
the sequence took several days to shoot even though the chase 's screen time is barely two - and - a - half minutes			1
director @entity286 also put together a similarly fantastic car chase in 1985 's " to live and @entity288 " 3			2
" @entity289 " ( 1969 ) @entity6 's famous " you 're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off , " has become a familiar refrain among " @entity289 " fans who love the @entity295 actor 's @entity293 twang and the 1969 comic car caper that saw a collection of car thieves attempting a high - stakes bank heist in the @entity301 city of @entity302			2
indescribably hip on its release , and a personification of @entity308 , the famous car chase featuring three red - white - and - blue @entity311 motoring through tight streets -- and even indoors -- was a landmark in quirky and fun car - chase sequencing and cinematography			1
the 2003 remake cleverly twinned audience appeal with the film following the 2001 release of @entity320 's new @entity311 that featured in the updated film , leading some to suggest it was merely a two - hour commercial for the new model			2
@entity92 autos : @entity311 trivia : @entity302 , or @entity326 , forms part of @entity301 car giant @entity326 's moniker -- @entity326			0
" ronin " ( 1998 ) although it will never be regarded as @entity332 's best dramatic performance , 1998 's " @entity329 " does n't land on our list for its dialogue			0
in unbelievable realism , viewers are treated to chase scenes with sport sedans such as a @entity340 , @entity341 and , perhaps most famously , an @entity342			0
plenty of police cars , trucks and motorcycles meet their end and more than 300 stunt drivers were employed to give the real - time chases scene an air of metal - crunching realism amid a character - driven plot that involves @entity356 operatives , mercenaries and multiple double - crosses surrounding a mysteriously valuable briefcase			1
there are few actors that can capture the mixture of terror and exhilaration involved in a car chase quite like @entity332 , while @entity367 is the only actor who could make driving a @entity341 an exercise in steely manhood			0
director @entity370 pretty nearly perfected the art of filming gritty car chase sequences in 1966 's " @entity373			0
" @entity24 " ( 1968 ) " @entity24 " is perennially voted one of the best car movies of all time and we 're comfortable following suit			1
in the 1968 classic , real - life racing enthusiast @entity5 barrels after bad guys on the streets of @entity205 in an epically cool 1968 @entity23 in a delicious " @entity383 " color			0
@entity92 autos : @entity23 in a cityscape that gets most drivers nervous for its ups and downs , @entity205 proves the ultimate car chase backdrop			1
lieutenant @entity24 is not only one of the coolest cops of all time , he proves to be one of the best wheelmen we 've ever seen			1
this is a must - see film and hands - down the best car chase movie of all time .			1

in most car - chase movies , the real star is the car , author says
the chase in " @entity256 " features a 1971 @entity270
more than 300 stunt drivers were employed for the 1998 " ronin " film
" @entity24 " is perennially voted one of the best car movies of all time
