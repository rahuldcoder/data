@entity0 , @entity1 -- the failed computer system that caused flight delays across the country has been restored , the @entity3 said thursday			1
@entity3 spokesman @entity7 said the system went out at 5:06 a.m. et and came back on about five hours later			1
he said officials working to pinpoint the cause know that there was a problem with the main telecommunications systems			1
" it was an efficiency problem rather than a safety problem , but it was a serious efficiency problem , " @entity7 said			2
due to the outage , air traffic controllers had to enter flight plans manually , a problem that causes delays , according to the @entity3 and the @entity21			1
the air traffic controllers ' group said the problem will cause flight delays throughout the day because of a " domino effect			1
" " air traffic controllers are without electronic decision - making tools and can not keep up with the sheer numbers of flights -- resulting in delays , " the controllers ' group said in a statement during the outage			1
" air traffic controllers on the ground at major airports are getting no automated flight plan information and have to enter that information manually , a cumbersome and time - consuming process			1
" @entity40 was among those passengers inconvenienced by flight delays when the computerized system that airlines use to file flight plans failed for several hours thursday in @entity0 , @entity1 , and @entity47 , @entity48			2
@entity40 said she thought her @entity50 flight would leave on time around 7 a.m. et from @entity51 , @entity52			0
but the 39 - year - old model sat for an hour and 15 minutes amid the noise of loud kids before the plane was ready to leave a logjammed runway and take off to @entity58 , @entity59			0
" i 'm frustrated , " she said , distracted by using @entity60 and calling on her cell phone as her plane sat planted on the runway			1
" i have somewhere to be			0
" @entity64 records video from tarmac @entity68 spokesman @entity67 said the airline had canceled 22 flights around the country as of 8 a.m. et and had delayed dozens more because of the flight plan filing system problem			1
he said most of the canceled flights were in @entity0 , @entity68 's hub of operations , and others are spread throughout the country			0
@entity67 said the problem will have " a pretty major impact on operations " and the cancellations will have a ripple effect			2
" we will be a mess all day , " he said			2
@entity68 , which operates about 700 flights a day , asked customers to check airtran.com before showing up at the airport			2
@entity90 spokeswoman @entity89 said the airline was not providing numbers on how many flights were affected			0
but she said that @entity90 will give travelers some flexibility in rescheduling			0
@entity98 spokesman @entity97 said that 300 to 500 flights had been delayed , virtually every one scheduled for takeoff			2
the longest delays have been a little more than an hour , but no flights have been canceled , and some might be consolidated , he said			0
" things are moving ; they are just moving more slowly , " @entity97 said , adding that @entity103 has been affected at @entity104 and @entity105 airports in @entity107 as well as in @entity109 / @entity108 , @entity110 , and @entity111 , @entity112			0
@entity97 said the problem reflects that the @entity103 air traffic control system operates with what he calls " 1960s technology " and needs to be modernized			1
@entity119 spokesman @entity118 said the airline had a few delays across the system , including some as long as 30 minutes but it does n't anticipate any more			2
@entity123 said officials there were " monitoring the situation regarding the @entity3 's automated flight plan system			1
" " the airport is working to minimize the impact on customers by bringing in additional staff and ensuring that all facilities are operational and fully maintained			0
all passengers are encouraged to contact the airlines regarding the statuses of their flights before they head to the airport , " the airport said			0
at @entity140 , most morning flights left on time with little impact from the computer glitch , but inbound flights from large hubs are expected to be delayed thursday and possibly into friday , said spokeswoman @entity146			1
the airport asked concessionaires to beef up staffing levels and has added employees to keep the facility clean and the passengers comfortable			0
the system -- the @entity154 , or @entity155 -- appears to be the same one that failed in august 2008			0
the @entity3 said the information in the network is data required to launch planes expeditiously			2
airplane safety was not affected , the @entity3 said , adding that planes in the air had radar coverage and communication			1
weather also might have played a role in @entity169 flight delays			0
the air traffic controllers said " weather equipment was affected " and information such as winds speeds was not " processing			1
" the controllers said that " airport efficiency is being cut at least [ in ] half at places like @entity105 " and that in the " @entity107 airspace , controllers are forced to put 20 miles of space between aircraft			0
" @entity2 's @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185 contributed to this report .			0
