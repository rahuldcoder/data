editor 's note : @entity2 , a former @entity3 chief economist , is a professor at @entity4 and a senior fellow at the @entity6			1
@entity7 is chairman of @entity8 , a @entity9 - based charity , and a research associate at the @entity11 , @entity12			1
they run http://baselinescenario.com / , a global economy web site			2
@entity2 , above , and @entity7 say the @entity15 could be in for a long period of virtually no growth			1
( @entity18 ) -- euphoria returns ! who could have guessed that @entity22 stock would rally 70 percent the week it learns the @entity24 are demanding new capital equal to nearly half the bank 's market capitalization ? the ongoing grim news -- on rising unemployment , continued ( albeit slower ) economic decline , and ordinary working @entity15 being hammered on all sides -- is being ignored by stock and commodity markets			2
is @entity15 now back on track for growth ? the answer to that is almost surely no. rising stock markets do n't necessarily mean a sharp recovery is under way			0
consider the case of @entity42 in its first lost decade of the 1990s			1
after falling 63 percent from its peak in late 1989 , the @entity44 staged a 32 percent rally in one month			0
it then remained volatile but around the same level for nearly 10 years -- because the return on assets and capital investors could earn proved so low throughout that economy			1
during the 1990s , @entity42 's banking system was burdened with bad loans that kept eating into profits and its nonfinancial companies had excess capacity that had to be wound down ; these problems were made worse by a decline in the working population			1
the initial excess of capital , supplemented by high ongoing savings from households and corporations , kept interest rates low			0
throughout this period the price / earnings ratio on stocks ranged from 30 to 50 ( it 's 51 today ) , compared with 15 to 20 in @entity69 and the @entity15			1
the logic was simple : with so little return available on all assets , local investors were willing to pay up for stocks even if the dividends were a paltry 1 - 2 percent			2
does this sound familiar ? we think so			0
the current rally in stocks marks one clear success -- the fear of a systemic collapse due to loss of confidence in our financial system has subsided			2
this is good news , and an important achievement of president @entity89 's team			2
however , our " turning @entity42 " phase may just have begun			1
the " stress tests " that were just completed do not mark the renewed health of our banking system			0
we still have 22 percent of @entity15 with houses worth less than their mortgages , and there are parallel problems for commercial property and other sectors			2
many bankruptcies are yet to come			0
most publicly traded large homebuilders are deep in debt , yet they are burning cash and waiting to see if -- magically -- the two - year stock of unsold housing can somehow disappear			0
we 've barely begun to downsize our auto industry , and the parts suppliers and dealers that go along with it , to reflect the lower level of consumer spending and scarcer availability of credit for the future			0
all of this is also true across much of @entity69			0
in essence , @entity69 and the @entity15 both are saddled with zombie banks ( which do n't really lend ) , zombie corporations ( which do n't grow ) , and a decline in the relative size of the working population ( as more people try to retire )			1
this " @entity42 " scenario can persist for many years			1
the biggest risk now is that the @entity126 and the @entity127 try to re-leverage our way out of a @entity42 - style prolonged recession by flooding the economy with cheap credit -- like they did in 2002 , but to an even greater degree			1
cheap government finance for powerful banks is a great cocktail for re-election ; running stress tests that were n't really stressful is a good indication this is where policy is heading			0
this time the money wo n't come from consumers ( or from @entity144 , as it did after 2002 ) ; it will be @entity15 and @entity69 central banks providing funds and our governments running massive budget deficits			0
if this is the strategy , the next crisis will be even more traumatic			0
budget deficits over 10 percent of @entity151 and trillions of dollars of new loans to the banks from the @entity126 are recipes for hyperinflation and , if the @entity126 and @entity127 do n't pull away the punch bowl soon , sharply increasing inflation is very much in the cards			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 and @entity7 .			1

@entity2 , @entity7 : stocks are rallying as if economy is out of the woods
they say that 's *premature* , and we could be in for a long period of *stagnation*
@entity42 's economy suffered for years from similar problems , they say
@entity2 , @entity7 : we have zombie banks and zombie companies
