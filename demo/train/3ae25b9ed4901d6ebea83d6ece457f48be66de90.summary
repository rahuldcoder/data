in september 2005 , i found out i was eight weeks pregnant with my first child			1
everything was fine -- better than fine			1
i was working full time , working out with a personal trainer , and in the gym on my own every day -- sometimes for two hours			1
all this was cleared by my doctor , as this had been my normal routine for almost two years			1
in my 12th week , i started to feel a little queasy in the morning			1
my doctor advised me that i should probably try eating a little more , but that it would pass eventually			2
i never would have dreamed that it would be 18 weeks and a lot of heartache later before it subsided			1
@entity16 and @entity17 baby news sparks media frenzy i went from feeling queasy to not being able to hold down water and struggling just to brush my teeth			1
i started to plan my life around when and where i was going to feel sick			2
i learned not to go to the meat department in the grocery store , and to travel with grocery bags lined with napkins in my car			2
when i woke up , i figured out that i could not open my eyes too quickly or my head would begin spinning , making me dizzy -- and eventually making me sick			2
i lost my voice because my throat was burned from acid			2
i even started making a pallet on my bathroom floor to sleep on because i did n't have the energy to keep getting up and going to the bathroom			2
concerned , i went back to the doctor			2
as my primary doctor was on leave , i saw another doctor			2
she told me that a lot of women come in with these symptoms and sometimes they just have to " suck it up , " and that since i had heard about morning sickness , it was probably in my head all the time anyway			2
she made me feel like i was crazy			0
but when my primary doctor returned , i was diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum -- the same condition that put @entity16 , @entity49 , in the hospital			1
then came the parade of medicines			0
i started with @entity53 , an anti-nausea medication commonly given to cancer patients , but i could n't keep the pill down long enough for it to work			1
@entity58 was a drug called @entity60 , compounded and applied topically on my wrists			0
the side effects made me feel as if i had a constant hangover , and i could n't stay awake -- then , it stopped working altogether			0
the princess and the puke : a fellow sufferer 's view by this time , i was 20 weeks pregnant and i had lost 20 pounds			1
i found out my child was a boy and he was healthy , but i worried neither one of us would make it			0
a feeding tube and hospitalization entered the discussion -- my doctor said there was no choice unless i was able to gain 5 pounds in a month			0
i had already been to the er so many times for dehydration , i knew most of the nurses by first name and they knew me			0
the last resort before hospitalization was a subcutaneous iv delivering anti-nausea medication 24 hours a day under my skin			1
by this time , i was out of work on bed rest			0
i was drowning in my illness			1
life as i had known it was over			0
i had a home nurse who came to once a week to give me iv fluids in my home			0
i had a full iv stand that i could wheel around my house			0
my nurse taught me how to insert the iv into my thigh and change the medicine every two days			0
it took a week , but slowly i began to feel a change for the better			0
the medicine decreased to every three days and finally , when i was 30 weeks pregnant , i was taken off			1
then one day , it was over			0
i woke up without medication , without dizziness and without being sick			1
i was almost scared , but it was over			0
i stopped feeling nauseous and i was able to gain all the weight i lost and what i should have gained in the last eight weeks of my pregnancy			1
my son was born in may of 2006 , -- 6 pounds , 11 ounces and in perfect health			0
for him , i would do it all again			0
pregnancy and privacy : royal @entity16 's dilemma			1

@entity119 's @entity118 was diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum
@entity16 , @entity49 , was hospitalized with the condition
@entity124 was put on *intravenous* medication and nearly hospitalized
she says her illness *disappeared* when she was 30 weeks pregnant
