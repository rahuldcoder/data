if reports wednesday are to be believed , one of the tech industry 's biggest deals in recent history was hammered out almost exclusively by two 20 - somethings over the course of what amounts to a long weekend			1
on april 8 , @entity9 ceo @entity8 let the company 's board of directors know he was about to spend $ 1 billion on hot photo start - up @entity12 -- just hours before the deal was done , according to the @entity15			1
the deal was nailed down , unnamed sources told the @entity15 , in only three days			0
meetings between @entity8 , 27 , and @entity12 head @entity19 , 28 , that took place at @entity8 's multi-million - dollar @entity22 , @entity23 , home			1
it 's a move that shows @entity8 displaying the hacker spirit that helped him launch a social - media juggernaut in his college dorm room			1
and that 's a spirit that does n't always jibe with the image of ceo of a corporation expected to be valued at up to $ 100 billion when it makes its first public stock offering in the next few weeks			1
" on balance , i 'm not sure it 's the best way to do business , " said @entity33 , @entity34 's chief business correspondent			1
" but @entity8 has defied all rules			0
" the moxie suggested in the report comes at an interesting time for @entity9 and @entity8 , who also reportedly whittled down @entity43 's initial asking price of $ 2 billion			1
on the brink of offering up @entity9 , with its hundreds of millions of users , to stockholders , even @entity8 's controlling interest in the company ( a 57 % share of voting rights , according to reports ) could soon need to be checked by the types of lawyers , bean - counters and other business types whose jobs involve looking out for a company 's bottom line			1
" this paints a complex picture of its ceo as at once confident and bold , and also nervous and panicky -- details that will be scrutinized come @entity9 's imminent ipo , " @entity58 wrote on @entity60 's website			2
@entity33 , who over the course of his career covered the " tech bubble " of the late 1990s , said the whirlwind purchase may , in fact , be a last hurrah of sorts for @entity8			2
" it actually happens more than we think			0
and it 's not a bad thing , particularly in non-public companies , @entity33 said			2
" but , in public companies , boards are important -- they are supposed to protect shareholder interests , and they are supposed to bring perspective and experience that a kid ceo may not have			0
" the @entity9 board did vote to approve the deal , according to the @entity15			1
but at that point , it was largely an endorsement more than a decision			0
the board , one source said , " was told , not consulted			0
" in the fast - moving world of web tech , being nimble is almost a prerequisite for survival			0
fail to adapt and someone else will pass you by			0
@entity12 , a mobile app which lets users enhance their photos with a raft of pre-created filters , was reportedly on the verge of nailing down a new round of private investments worth $ 50 million			0
could that have made @entity8 overpay for a company with 13 employees and no revenue to date ? maybe , says @entity33			2
" creativity , innovation and deal - making are different strengths ; rarely does one person possess all of them , " he said			0
" that @entity8 felt strongly that he wanted @entity115 may not have made him the best person to do the deal -- that 's why we have real estate agents , or talent agents			2
" for what it 's worth , @entity9 chief operating officer @entity121 was aware of the negotiations all along , although she did n't personally take part			2
and , for @entity9 , making a profit directly from @entity12 may have been less important than locking up its user data and taking a rapidly growing competitor , now with more than 40 million users , off of the playing field			0
regardless of where the future takes @entity9 -- whether life as a publicly traded commodity is more about stuffy board meetings than spur - of - the moment handshake deals -- wednesday 's report provided at least one more glimpse at the hoodie - wearing , authority - flouting ceo whose origin story has literally become the stuff of @entity144 storytelling			1
" what 's cooler than a billion dollars ? " @entity147 of @entity146 wrote , invoking the oft - paraphrased line from @entity9 biopic " @entity150			1
" " a billion dollars without board approval			0

@entity9 - @entity12 deal provides a glimpse of @entity8 's hacker spirit
the billion - dollar deal was negotiated almost exclusively by @entity8 , @entity15 says
ceo - only *negoitations* are n't *unheard* of , but have risks , @entity34 's @entity33 says
once @entity9 goes public , such deals may become a thing of the past
