-- unlike their @entity3 counterparts , @entity1 take elections very seriously -- rising up early to queue patiently in line for hours under the hot sun and cast their ballots			1
any misguided attempt to nullify or steal their votes will evoke a strong reaction from them			0
in fact , it explains why the destruction of an @entity1 country often begins with a dispute over the electoral process or transfer of power			1
in recent years , allegations of electoral fraud have stirred political violence and civil war , causing death and destruction in @entity25 ( 2005 ) , @entity26 ( 2007 ) , @entity27 ( 2008 ) , @entity28 ( 2011 ) , among others			0
the adamant refusal of their respective leaders to relinquish or share power damaged or destroyed these @entity1 countries : @entity35 ( 1990 ) , @entity36 ( 1991 ) , @entity37 ( 1994 ) , @entity28 , now @entity28 , ( 1993 ) , @entity38 ( 1998 ) , @entity39 ( 2000 , 2011 ) , @entity40 ( 2011 ) , @entity41 ( 2011 )			1
this largely motivated @entity42 , the telecoms billionaire mogul , to offer a $ 5 million prize to any @entity1 leader who shows " excellent leadership " and who steps down peacefully when his term expires or loses an election			2
this year -- and for the third time since the inception of the prize in 2006 -- he found no eligible recipient			0

what are the secrets to @entity53 's democratic success or maturity that other @entity1 countries can learn from ? four factors account for this			1
the first is the existence of a free media ; in particular , print and broadcast media			1
in @entity1 , radio is the life and death of information transmission and the proliferation of @entity79 radio stations in @entity53 provided an invaluable tool to expose problems , hold government accountable and ensure transparent elections			1
in the 2000 elections , for example , @entity79 stations sent their reporters to every polling station			0
anything suspicious or unseemly was immediately reported on the air , leading electoral officers and observers to rush to the scene and fix the problem on the spot			0
watch : media 's role in @entity53 politics they did not have to wait months for a voluminous report to expose the problem , by which time it would have been too late			1
thus , the @entity79 stations ensured a level of transparency seldom seen in @entity1 elections			1
so impressed was @entity107 columnist @entity106 , that he wrote : " let 's stop sending @entity1 lectures on democracy			1
let 's instead make all aid , all @entity119 - @entity118 loans , all debt relief conditional on @entity1 governments permitting free @entity79 radio stations			1
@entity1 will do the rest , " he wrote			2
sadly , @entity1 have not been able to do the rest because , currently , only 10 of the 54 @entity1 countries have a free media			1
in @entity25 , for example , there is only one government - controlled television network for 83 million people			0
the second factor has been the existence of vibrant and vigilant civil society groups and ngos -- all made possible by freedom of association , of expression and movement , as well as improvements in communication technology such as cell phones and text messaging			2
there are hordes of @entity133 -- promoting a diverse range of issues such as good governance combating corruption , among others			0
some have been formed specifically to oversee the december 7 elections			1
one with impressive credentials is the @entity151 ( @entity151 ) , which organized the presidential debates			0
the @entity151 also facilitated the crafting of a " @entity154 " and the setting up of a @entity156 to enforce the code			0
eight parties have signed on			0
the code ensures that the political parties behave responsibly and can be held liable for any unlawful or unethical acts they commit			0
nearly all civil society groups , including religious leaders have been preaching peaceful elections			1
even former president @entity166 , the architect of " macho - men " violence in the past , is now campaigning -- not for any political party candidate -- but for peace			0

last year , they reportedly sent more than $ 14.5 billion in remittances			0
they can shape and influence political opinion , as well as support various political candidates			0
with access to the foreign media , governments and institutions , they can raise a stink over electoral shenanigans in @entity53			1
in most other @entity1 countries , the space for civic activism is severely restricted			2
in @entity25 , journalists critical of the government have been branded " terrorists " and jailed			0
there is no privately - owned news media left in @entity197 , the " @entity198 " of @entity1 , and one can be jailed in @entity27 for insulting the president			1
by contrast , @entity53 presidents expect to be insulted			2
the third important factor has been the maturing of political leaders , which was stupendously displayed in the 2008 elections , which the ruling @entity207 party won by a mere 40,000 - vote margin			0
elsewhere on the continent , an election that close would have spelled trouble -- angry calls for a recount and descent into violence			0
but @entity216 , the losing candidate and now a contender , graciously conceded defeat			0
having hosted refugees fleeing political violence and mayhem in neighboring countries , @entity53 politicians and the people are now well aware of the destructive consequences an irresponsible political decision may cause			2
political maturity was also on full display following the death of former president @entity230 in july			0
not only was the transition to a new president extraordinarily smooth but @entity53 of all shades and stripes , buried their differences and came together to grieve over their departed president			2
a violent and chaotic election this week would dishonor his memory			0
a nod should also be given to regional leaders , in particular those of @entity53 's neighbors			2
borders are porous in @entity1 and violence in one country can send refugees streaming across the border			2
@entity53 has hosted refugees from civil wars in @entity35 and @entity39			2
in the past , regional leaders have also helped ensure free , fair and transparent elections in @entity53			1
for example , for the 2000 elections , the former and late president of @entity254 , @entity255 , closed the @entity53 / @entity254 border to prevent some of his citizens from crossing it to vote illegally in @entity53 's elections			1
the fourth factor has been sheer luck			0
@entity53 was fortunate to have one of its sons , @entity266 , serve as the @entity268 @entity267 ( 1997 - 2006 ) and co-recipient of the @entity270			2
during his tenure , he hop - scotched around the world , trying to end conflicts , douse political flames			0
he is the first on call when a country implodes to broker a peace deal -- @entity26 ( 2007 ) , @entity279 ( 2011 ) , etc. imagine @entity266 telling combatants in @entity26 and @entity279 to bury their differences when his own country is on fire with politicians at each other 's throat			0
@entity266 has an @entity133 in @entity287 and plays an important role in ensuring peaceful elections in @entity53			1
though other @entity1 countries may not have a " @entity266 , " the other three factors are still potent in ensuring free , fair and peaceful elections			1
alarm bells have been sounded over the possibility of massive fraud in the december 7 elections			1
but , given the current atmosphere in @entity53 , it would be foolhardy for any politician to even dream of committing fraud in friday 's elections -- unless he wants to commit political suicide			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity304 .			0

@entity53 heads to the polls on december 7
it has successfully held elections and transferred power on five occasions since 1992
@entity304 : free media , civil groups , are secrets of the country 's success
these factors can ensure free , fair and peaceful elections across @entity1 , he says
