@entity0 , @entity1 -- we had tried for weeks to get access to @entity6 's incursion into lawless @entity1			1
the go finally came from the @entity6 military in a text message late one saturday night			1
we 're told to be at the @entity11 's military airbase before dawn			0
" bring our own flak jackets , " we were told			0
in october , the @entity6 defense forces surprised many by sweeping into @entity1 to take on @entity17 , an @entity18 militant group bent on overthrowing the weak transitional government			1
at first , the " spin " by generals and politicians was that it was a swift reaction to punish @entity17 for its suspected involvement in a series of kidnappings			1
but peering through the window of a rattling @entity30 transport chopper , it is clear that what soldiers and security analysts have been telling us is true			0
the combat base on the @entity6 side of the border is well established -- an area of cleared ground dotted with orderly rows of tents and military hardware -- including artillery pieces			1
it 's obvious the soldiers here have have been preparing for some time			0
this is no rescue posse thrown together			0
@entity6 aims to obliterate @entity17			1
" the reason for this campaign is to liberate the locals here from the rule of the @entity17 , " @entity46 tells me , several magazines of ammo in his front pockets			1
" my troops are committed and they are out ready to sacrifice so that they are able to achieve the objective that has brought us here			0
" the major says his biggest military challenge is that @entity17 's weakness is its strength			2
militarily they could n't match @entity6 's firepower			1
but their small and mobile forces know the territory and terror			2
" the war here is a blend of both conventional and asymmetrical , " he says , " and that poses some peculiar challenges			0
" not that the thrust of this front is being spearheaded by truly conventional forces			2
we are traveling with the 20th parachute battalion -- an elite and sometimes - controversial group -- within the @entity6 army			1
with them are @entity1 militia and forces of the transitional government			1
their uniforms are a bit more tatty -- but their firepower no less impressive			2
we drive into @entity1 in @entity90 and @entity91 - no passport control necessary			2
a maxim in @entity1 , though , is that armies come and go			2
skill and training often has little to do with it			0
the @entity101 military came and went in the 1990s ( remember the film " @entity102 " ) , @entity99 peacekeeping forces made a hasty exit , @entity105 ground forces took the capital and then left it , and @entity107 and @entity109 soldiers have been fighting tooth and nail for @entity112 for years			0
the @entity6 and @entity1 commanders on the front are very aware of their predicament			1
winning the hearts and minds of the population will be a crucial step			0
but at the southern front line near @entity122 , a village perched right on the @entity123 , the elders say that it 's gotten worse since the war came to their village			0
the charcoal trade has been suspended and fishing is discouraged by the military			0
there is little to put food on the table , they say			0
it would seem that speed is important , and @entity1 commanders say they hope to strike across the line " within a week			1
" at the very front of the front line , a @entity6 paratrooper sits atop a @entity141 ( an suv with a anti-aircraft gun bolted to the back )			1
he peers across the river that marks the border between their territory and @entity17 's			2
the soldiers say they are ready to go .			0

@entity6 forces have entered @entity1 with the aim of taking on @entity17
the aim is to liberate locals from the rule of @entity17 , an @entity18 militant group
while @entity6 forces have the firepower , @entity17 know the terrain
commanders say they hope to strike across the line " within a week "
