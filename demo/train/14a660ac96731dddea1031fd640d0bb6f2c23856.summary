remember all that fuss over the @entity5 ? now it 's the @entity7 's turn			1
but what sort of retirement party awaits the airline industry 's final scheduled @entity7 passenger flight ? the final - flight honor goes to @entity15 @entity14 , operator of the world 's last passenger @entity7 -- which the airline says will be making its final scheduled flight on december 7 , on an otherwise routine flight			1

in february 2014 , @entity51 plans to fly passengers from the @entity15 capital of @entity64 to @entity65 , @entity66 , on its retired @entity7 - 10 , one last time			1
it 's " a fitting end for an aircraft that has served @entity51 loyally and well over many years , " states the airline , which plans to start selling tickets for this special bonus voyage on its website by early january			1

@entity7 's checkered history @entity7 's famous ( and at times infamous ) jetliner logged its maiden voyage for passengers on august 5 , 1971 , on an @entity92 round trip between @entity93 and @entity94			1
at the time , the plane filled an industry need for an innovative aircraft smaller than a 747 with long - range capabilities that could serve airports with shorter runways			2
a staple of several major airlines over four decades -- @entity7 produced its 446th , and last , @entity7 - 10 in 1989 for @entity104 -- the aircraft would be hampered by tragic accidents , including a horrific @entity107 crash at @entity94 's @entity108 in 1979 resulting from a separated engine ripping through a wing shortly after takeoff			1
the incident would lead to an @entity114 grounding of all @entity115 in the @entity35 for more than a month and stoke widespread public fear about the @entity7 -- despite findings that a maintenance error was largely the cause			2

" @entity148 factor in retirement a more significant factor behind the @entity7 retirement wave relates to fuel efficiency and cost			2
newer aircraft use less fuel , making @entity115 a more expensive airliner to operate			0
it also requires a three - man crew , including a second officer or flight engineer -- an overhead - boosting rarity these days			1
even if today 's harried commercial passengers are n't exactly missing @entity115 ( let alone knowing what makes one different than , say , an @entity167 ) , some of its past pilots have nice things to say about them			0
