president @entity0 is ordering the most sweeping overhaul of the immigration system in decades , despite @entity4 claims he is acting illegally by moving unilaterally to shield five million undocumented immigrants			1
@entity0 rejected accusations by conservatives that he is offering a free pass to undocumented immigrants and warned in a prime - time address that he would bolster border security and make it harder for unauthorized outsiders to get into the country			1
" today our immigration system is broken and everybody knows it , " @entity0 said			1
" it 's been this way for decades and for decades we have n't done much about it			2
" @entity0 is pressing ahead and making broad changes to the immigration system without the consent of @entity24 , which has failed to pass a comprehensive reform bill			1
the announcement prompted an angry response from @entity29 speaker @entity28			1
" by ignoring the will of the @entity33 people , president @entity0 has cemented his legacy of lawlessness and squandered what little credibility he had left , " @entity28 said			1
" republicans are left with the serious responsibility of upholding our oath of office			2
" a key element of @entity0 's plan is to instruct immigration authorities to target those undocumented immigrants who are dangerous rather than law - abiding undocumented parents of @entity33 citizens and residents and others			1
he said they will go after " felons , not families			1
gang members , not a @entity54 who 's working hard to provide for her kids			2
" " we 'll prioritize , just like law enforcement does every day , " he said			2
the changes will offer those who qualify the chance to stay temporarily in the country for three years , as long as they pass background checks and pay back taxes			2
but they will not be offered a path to eventual citizenship or be eligible for federal benefits or health care programs			0
and , in theory , the measures could be reversed by a future president			0
" if you meet the criteria , you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law			0
if you 're a criminal , you 'll be deported			0
if you plan to enter the @entity33 illegally , your chances of getting caught and sent back just went up , " @entity0 said			1
the president argued that ordering a mass amnesty would be unfair but mass deportation would " be both impossible and contrary to our character			2
" @entity4 are slamming @entity0 's use of executive authority as a mammoth presidential power grab			1
but @entity0 said he was acting in a manner consistent with action taken by @entity4 and @entity89 presidents			1
" to those members of @entity24 who question my authority to make our immigration system work better , or question the wisdom of me acting where @entity24 has failed , i have one answer : pass a bill			0
" officials insist that @entity0 's moves are deeply grounded in law and constitutional precedent , despite claims by @entity4 that they represent an unlawful overreach of his authority as president and his oath of office			1
" the actions you see here reasonably sit within his powers , " one senior administration official said			0
" i think that they are bold and they are aggressive but they are in keeping with precedent			0
" congressional republicans are weighing their response , juggling ideas that range from a government shutdown to holding up @entity0 's nominees in the @entity123			1
and in the states , some @entity4 officials had already raised the possibility of lawsuits against the president			0
the most far - reaching changes in @entity0 's order will offer papers and work authorization to up to four million people who are undocumented parents of @entity33 citizens or legal permanent residents , as long as they have lived in the @entity33 for five years or longer			1
@entity0 will also remove the upper age limit of 30 years old from a program known as @entity138 ( @entity138 ) or @entity139 that allows those brought illegally to the country as children to stay , offering relief to thousands more people			1
the program will cover anyone who arrived in the country before 2010 and will extend a previous two - year guarantee of relief to three years			0
but @entity29 lawyers concluded the president did not have the power to offer parents of those covered under @entity138 permits to stay in the country and work , a move that will disappoint some immigration reform lobby groups			0
in one concession however , parents of the so - called " dreamers " will be removed from priority lists for deportation			1
officials said that the broad sweep of the immigration measures were within @entity0 's powers because he was directing authorities to prioritize which groups of the 11.4 million undocumented immigrants in the country should be deported			1
" deferred action is not a pathway to citizenship			0
it is not legal status			0
it simply says that for three years , you are not a law enforcement priority and are not going to go after you , " said one senior official			2
" it is temporary and it is revocable			0
" officials said law enforcement officials made similar decisions each day about which categories of offenders to target with prosecution and the president was simply charting a new way to apply existing immigration laws			0
the new approach , which will begin to be phased in next spring , will include a more robust effort to target gang members , suspected terrorists , and felons			2
it will also focus more sharply on undocumented immigrants who have recently crossed @entity33 borders			1
this is a bid to slow the flow of illegal immigration , the officials said			0
new resources are also expected to be announced to secure borders , following claims that enforcement is lax and contributed to the flow of thousands of undocumented child migrants into the @entity33 earlier this year , which sparked a hot political controversy			2
in moves likely be applauded by the business community , the administration will also reform immigration rules to make it easier for science and technology students to study in the @entity33 there will also be a new program to attract entrepreneurs to come to the @entity33 if they can show they have sufficient investors			2
but the president got mixed reviews among leaders in border states			0
" in the face of @entity231 gridlock , the president stepped up for hard - working families across @entity33			2
this is the right thing to do , and it 's time for @entity24 to finish the job , " said @entity234 gov. @entity233 , a @entity235			0
but @entity240 gov. @entity239 said @entity0 should have sought a bipartisan solution			1
" he is once again taking brazen , unilateral action that will only further exacerbate the border problem , " the @entity4 said			0
@entity245 gov. @entity244 said the president 's action will lead to more illegal immigration			0
" it is time for the president and @entity24 to secure our border , followed by meaningful reforms			0
there is no more time for political grandstanding , " he said			0
the changes that @entity0 announced , however , fall far short of the reforms that could be enacted were @entity24 to pass a comprehensive immigration bill			1
the president has no power to put undocumented immigrants on the long road to citizenship			1
he can not grant permanent residence permits known as @entity265 , and all of his changes could be struck down by a future president			0
officials insisted that @entity0 's moves were consistent with immigration actions ordered by presidents , including @entity273 and @entity274 , for decades			1
the magnitude of the numbers involved here , however , surpass anything any president had done before .			0

speaker @entity28 slams @entity0 for " legacy of lawlessness "
