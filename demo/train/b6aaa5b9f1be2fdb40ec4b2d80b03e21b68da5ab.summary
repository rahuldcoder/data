even though the @entity0 store was profitable , the overall chain was losing money , according to company officials			1
some in @entity0 fear the lack of a book store will make the city look like an ignorant outpost on the @entity1 border			1
" assuming that we do n't read because we 're @entity75 or we 're immigrant or we 're poor , that is not the case , " said @entity70 , the city 's spokeswoman who spearheads the " @entity28 " initiative			0

i felt we needed another point of distribution			0
" @entity101 admits it took a little while to get used to book signings and readings in the midst of a chaotic grocery store			2
