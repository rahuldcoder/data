for those of us who live inland , hurricane - tracking seems more a curious indulgence , but if you live along the coastal regions in a hurricane zone , keeping tabs on these atmospheric leviathans is paramount			1
here 's a rundown of 2012 ′ s top hurricane tracking apps for those on the go with tablets or smartphones			1
@entity15 ( @entity16 ) my pick of the bunch , @entity24 ' $ 2.99 @entity15 offers detailed storm maps , @entity19 info , threat level maps , audio / video forecast updates , real - time feeds and push alerts			0
it also employs my favorite interface , giving you four simple categories at launch — hurricanes , tropical storms , tropical depressions and invests — to drill on , with a " quick headlines " blurb and " current systems " maps when you scroll down the page			0
the number of maps ( including animated ) and images crammed into this app — @entity45 claims over 65 — is worth the price of admission alone			2
@entity48 ( @entity49 ) @entity48 uses @entity50 as its framework and tracks both forecasts and the locations of @entity55 and @entity56 hurricanes and tropical storms , points out areas the @entity60 is keeping tabs on and offers standard @entity60 " tropical outlooks and discussions , public advisories , forecasts , and satellite imagery			2
" fair warning : the free version of @entity48 has n't been updated in over a year , and it looks like the $ 1.99 add - free version is where developer @entity71 is focusing its attention , recently adding support for " current radar and weather satellite overlays			0
" @entity15 / @entity77 ( @entity16 ) developer @entity79 's longstanding $ 2.99 hurricane - watching app ( updated in june ) offers a repository of global meteorological information , including tracking maps , satellite views , five - day forecasts , radar and bulletins from the @entity19			1
pull up @entity87 and you can see information about wind speed , storm speed and direction as well as follow it from its genesis off the west coast of @entity96 in mid-august through its current position several hundred miles southeast of the @entity98			1
probably the app 's most valuable function : using @entity16 's locational services to determine how far away you are			0
if all you need is tracking for the @entity55 , @entity102 , @entity103 and the @entity104 and @entity105 , @entity79 offers @entity106 , a cheaper $ 0.99 version that eschews the app 's global features , and if you 're looking for the tablet - optimized version of @entity15 , @entity79 offers @entity15 hd for $ 3.99 , which adds " exclusive " video and blog updates from @entity115			1
@entity116 ( @entity49 ) when i checked in last , @entity116 was a promising beta freebie			0
it 's now out of beta — still free , though ad - littered ( there 's a $ 2.99 ad - free " pro " version ) — and packing hurricane data from the @entity19 , high resolution maps , satellite images , warning information and storm tracks			1
@entity129 ( @entity16 ) @entity129 is free with ads , distinguishing itself from the pack by tucking a few features behind an in - app paywall			2
out of the gate , you can track hurricanes using satellite and radar data , stage email alerts and gauge your distance from " each coordinate of the storm			0
" but if you want the app 's push services , " more space on the main map " and to banish those annoying ads that sit at the top of the screen , you 'll have to fork over $ 2.99 through an in - app purchase option			0
@entity15 -- @entity151 @entity150 ( @entity49 , @entity16 ) last but not least , @entity15 -- @entity151 @entity150 for both @entity49 or @entity152 is a newer , totally free addition to @entity49 's growing hurricane - tracking stable , but it 's more than just a tracker — this app lets you " monitor conditions in your area or throughout the storm track , prepare your family and home , find help and let others know you are safe even if the power is out			1
" it 's a little light on meteorological data , but think of it as the " safety first " tracker , and check out the video below for a few examples of it in action .			0
