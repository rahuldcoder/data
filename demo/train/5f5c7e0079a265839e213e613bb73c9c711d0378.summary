@entity0 -- @entity2 is in a celebratory mood			1
and rightly so : she 's survived 50 years in show business			2
@entity2 says that her new @entity7 - produced album was meant to sound like a throwback to the folk era			1
the legendary singer , who rose to fame during the folk movement of the 1950s and 1960s , is marking the occasion with a new album called " @entity15			1
" produced by @entity7 ( whom @entity2 likes to call " @entity17 " ) , it 's a collection of bluegrass - tinged songs reminiscent of her early repertoire			1
" we were looking for songs that feel like now but sound like back then , " she said			2
@entity7 penned one of the album 's standout tracks , " @entity27 is @entity27 , " which he describes as " recovery speak			1
" @entity2 also covers " @entity30 , " a song written by @entity32 and @entity33 for the 2003 film " @entity35			1
" at 67 , @entity2 finds her voice may not have the sheer power it did in her 20s , but her political spirit is intact			1
she passionately expressed her support for @entity42 during the presidential campaign , the first time the self - described pacifist has taken sides in party politics			2
" i have n't heard an orator like that since @entity49 , " she said			1
@entity2 knew the rev. @entity49 and famously sang the protest song " we shall overcome " to a massive crowd at the @entity53 during @entity49 's 1963 march on @entity54			1
@entity2 spoke to @entity1 about sustaining her voice and finding happiness in her 60s			1
the following is an edited version of that interview , which was conducted before tuesday 's election			2
@entity1 : what did @entity7 bring to the table with your new album ? @entity2 : oh , everything but the voice			1
his gruffness to my non-gruffness			2
he worked fast , really fast , and i like that			2
and he brought the musicians			2
i do n't know who to choose for musicians			1
we were a good match			2
@entity1 : is there a song on the album that speaks to you more than others ? @entity2 : i guess the ones i go back listening to are " @entity27 is @entity27 " and " @entity85			1
" " @entity85 " sounds exactly like an old folk song			2
i would n't have guessed in a million years that it 's contemporary			1
@entity1 : how does it feel to be embarking on a new tour at such a politically charged time ? @entity2 : i 've never seen this country this politically charged			1
i realized something this morning			2
i was watching @entity42 on tv and i thought , " i really love this guy			2
" i love what he 's capable of , i love that he 's genuine			2
he 's a statesman , and he 's brilliant			2
people say do you think he can change @entity98 ? he already has			0
... and i know most of the things he 'll have to do i would battle him to the death			0
he 's going to be commander in chief of the @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 , and i 'm a pacifist [ laughs ]			0
@entity1 : so you would almost prefer that he did n't run for president , that his talents could be applied in other ways ? @entity2 : yeah			1
i 've thought that , yeah			0
part of me wishes very strongly that @entity42 would be outside the system and his hands would be less tied			0
@entity1 : in the ' 50s and ' 60s , you lived and breathed the causes you rallied behind			0
when you look at young musicians today , do you feel they 're attaching themselves to charities or causes because it 's hip , rather than meaningful ? @entity2 : i think it 's probably a combination of things			1
i think people are afraid of risk so they 'll [ only ] go so far			0
but i do n't think people have felt the urgency that we felt in the ' 60s			1
there 's a need for community , but we do n't feel it			1
@entity1 : why is that ? @entity2 : that we do n't feel it ? because we live more and more separately			1
kids are walking down the street plugged in [ to personal electronics ]			0
the only place there 's community really is in the ghetto , where they need each other and they know it			0
we need each other , and we do n't know it			1
@entity1 : you look back at all the causes you 've rallied behind , and there have been so many			0
... @entity2 : it makes me dizzy			1
@entity1 : [ @entity160 ] you feel emotionally wrung out ? @entity2 : no. it 's the opposite			1
what happens is it starts generating energy for myself			1
there 's some part of me that 's wiped out			0
@entity1 : do you find you have to work harder to keep your voice in shape ? @entity2 : oh @entity27 , yeah			1
it was very humiliating to find out that i was like everybody else in the world and that i had to get coaching			0
and now it 's a real issue			0
i have to do [ vocal exercises ] every day , especially on tour			0
@entity1 : would you say that life in your 60s is easier than life in your 20s and 30s ? @entity2 : oh @entity27 , yes			1
... i was a highly neurotic kid , not particularly happy , which probably accounts for all those beautiful songs , those beautiful sad ballads			0
i found my home there			0
and as the years went by and as the therapy went on i was holding together			0
and then at around 50 , i decided to fall apart and find the pieces and put them back where they should 've been			0
and i did what i thought was impossible , which was really drag the stuff up , look at it , go through all that and then each time i did that ... it became a daily thing with the therapist ... to find out something huge			0
go through the terror , go through all of it and then by the end of the week something had changed a little bit			0
this went on for a number of years			0
so i am now in a stage nothing like where i was before then			1
there 's no stage fright now			1
just the joy of singing			0
@entity1 : you 're happy being single , are n't you ? @entity2 : yeah			1
after all i 've been through , i do n't want to risk [ pats her heart ]			2
i mean i feel so extraordinary , so much better			0
and you know if something walked into my life that feels right ... the question is , am i ready to see it or not ? i 'm sure it 's wandered by me a few times			0
but at some point maybe i 'll be ready to see that in which case it would be a good thing			0
... [ in ] @entity230 there 's no real happiness without the struggle			0
but the struggle has to defeat you in a way [ before ] you get to be like the @entity236			0
you know those monks all giggle ? all the time ! they 've got it figured out			0
because things are what they are on @entity244 , and you be as good as you can , and you die , it 's the next life			0
so what 's the big f * * * * * * deal ?			0
