@entity1 , @entity2 -- " the poachers are usually hiding firearms in the fishing camps , " @entity0 briefs us as his anti-poaching unit 's shaky metal boats speed down one of the rivers that snakes it way through the @entity1			1
the river 's dark waters are stunningly framed by shades of green and cascading vines in this remote corner of the @entity2			1
as @entity0 's eco-guard unit turns a corner , he gives the order to cut the engines			1
we 're approaching the first suspected site			1
the boats coast silently against the hum of the forest			1
the team quietly assaults , but the camp is deserted			1
a member of the team checks the ashes			1
" it 's still warm , they must have left early morning , we missed them by a couple hours , " he says			1
for the next grueling , hot eight hours , the same scenario repeats itself			1
then , suddenly around a bend , the unit spots rising smoke			1
they rush ashore , fan out and within seconds the first gunshot rings out			2
the men sprint through the dense and disorienting terrain , forcing their way though the undergrowth and knee - deep water as even more bursts of gunfire echo through the forest			2
pumped on adrenaline , eco-guard @entity50 animatedly re-enacts what happened when he saw the poachers			1
" i yelled ' stop , stop ! ' and shot in the air , " he says			2
" the man tried to shoot at me			2
i tackled him and grabbed his gun , but he was able to escape			2
" @entity50 happily displays the captured weapon			2
the team finds the poachers ' canoe , weighed down with fresh elephant meat			1
an eco-guard lifts up a portion of the elephant 's trunk , still dripping blood			1
he lifts up heavy chunks of elephant flesh , searching for weapons and tusk on the bottom of the wooden canoe			1
" this is what they use to cut off the tusks " @entity0 says , holding up a bloodied ax			1
it 's a sickening reminder of a trade that has decimated the park 's elephant population			1
the non-profit group @entity82 -- which runs @entity1 -- estimates that @entity83 has lost 62 % of its forest elephant population in the last decade			1
in the week we spent at the park , we only saw one alive			1
opinion : how to end the elephant slaughter " the ivory we get , it 's less than 1 % " @entity0 estimates			1
" in this area , it makes a lot of money			2
it 's very difficult to say , maybe one or more elephant is killed a day			1
" @entity0 describes the fight to protect what 's left as guerrilla warfare carried out by just 76 eco-guards patrolling an area that is 13,500 km2 ( 8,390 square miles ) -- about the size of @entity103			1
hardly enough , but around 40 % of the team members are former poachers themselves			1
" they are really motivated to stop the poaching and they know how the poachers work , so it 's easy for them to think like them , " @entity0 explains			1
it 's part of a program developed by @entity0 in the past year in which poachers are given amnesty if they hand over their weapons and confess			1
but it 's still a tough sell in an area where villages live off poaching and there are no other alternatives			2
the unit 's successes have n't made them any friends			2
members often find themselves pursuing neighbors , friends and even family members			2
they have all been threatened			2
@entity130 tells us three men assaulted his wife down a dark side street in his village			2
" she went to buy petrol at the market , " he says			2
" when she was on her way back home they attacked her , tried to rape her , but she was strong			2
she pulled back and her dress ripped and she ran away			2
" the threats intensify after arrests and raids , and did so even more after the team brought in @entity148 , better known as " @entity149			2
" @entity150 , who used to poach for @entity149 back in 2004 , testified against him in court			2
they live in the same village and @entity149 's relatives have vowed revenge			2
" his mother promised to poison me , " @entity150 says			0
" i do n't go out after dark unless i am with five or six other people , i do n't eat out			0
i am always on alert			0
" @entity82 headquarters is just a 10 - minute drive from @entity149 's village , which has forced @entity0 to send his own family away			0
" there was threats of attack on the camp where we live , my family was with me at this time			0
i do n't want to take the risk for them because of my job , " he tells us			0
but the toughest challenge for @entity0 and his team is government corruption			0
he does n't trust for a second that the government will follow any leads after the bust on the poachers ' camp			1
the team finds four guns , one of which @entity0 says is military issue			0
of all of the weapons the unit has in its stockpile -- a combination of those handed over in the amnesty program and those seized in raids -- the majority come from military stock			1
" the military sells firearms to the poachers , " @entity0 claims			1
" sometime we catch military with their firearms inside the park			1
" in an area where the lines between poachers and protectors tend to blur because of village and family ties , at times the team ca n't even trust itself			1
" to find this in the @entity2 you must have contact with a ranger , " @entity0 says , showing a compass found at the poachers ' camp			1
" it 's a silver one and it 's not an old one			0
" also found during the raid was a cellphone			0
dogs help to sniff out poaching the team torches the camp to send a message and sets off down the river with the poachers ' canoe in tow as bright orange flames engulf the ramshackle huts			1
but it 's far from over			0
the next morning , @entity0 is busy drawing a map in the sand , strategizing the best way to get into position			0
one of the numbers on the phone they found is that of a notorious bushmeat trader			0
" we had an initial phone contact and we organized a meeting , " @entity0 explains			0
" we play like we are the poacher and he thinks we are the poacher			0
" it 's an ambush			0
barreling down the road , the team spots the bushmeat trader on his motorcycle			0
shouting with guns pointed , they force him to pull over			0
" how do you justify that this phone we called you from was found with a poacher ? " @entity0 asks the trader			0
" you were saying that you wanted to collect material , ivory			0
" " i do n't know who called me , " the trader claims			0
" everyone in the village has my number			0
" the cell phone rings , answered by an eco-guard pretending to be the suspected poacher			0
the person on the other end of the line issues a breathless warning			0
" remove all the weapons from the camp by the river , we 've spotted the eco-guards at the small port			1
" meanwhile , the trader breaks , giving up the name and location of the cell phone 's owner			0
" they are just there , they live there			0
he 's a young guy			0
" the team detains not one , but two brothers and take them back to one of the unit 's checkpoints			0
one confesses to owning one of the rifles found at the camp , but both deny they shot at the eco-guards and refuse to give up the names of the other members of the gang			1
poachers poison 87 elephants for ivory they are handcuffed and driven off to jail			1
when we return to @entity310 , we interview @entity311 , minister of @entity312 and @entity313 , and ask about the rampant corruption claims			0
he denied direct military complicity , but conceded the government needs to clean up its ranks			0
" yes , it is true that there are accomplices to this illegal trading of wildlife , that is not easy , " he told us			0
he insists that the government is committed to fighting corruption and ending the culture of poaching with impunity			0
a few days after the two brothers were detained , their families gave up the names of the rest of the gang members , in hopes of getting the brothers out of jail			0
based on that intel , the unit carried out another raid			0
one of the eco-guards was severely wounded , run over by a motorcycle as they attempted to detain the suspected poacher			1
as the team was transporting the wounded guard to hospital , gang members torched the eco-guard camp at the checkpoint			0
out here , the war on ivory trading is violent and personal			0
opinion : elephant killings surge as tusks fund terror @entity356 crushes tons of confiscated ivory			1

a group of eco-guards track poachers in a park the size of @entity103
they *uncover* a canoe filled with elephant meat , a bloody ax
some guards are former poachers , who accepted amnesty and turned in weapons
