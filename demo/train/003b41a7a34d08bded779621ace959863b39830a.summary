@entity0 -- as i write , we have just received news of what we believe to be the 29th @entity6 in the past month to set fire to themselves in protest at @entity11 rule in @entity12			1
by the time you read this , it is likely that more have made this extraordinary choice			0
at @entity12 we have seen protesters die from their injuries and survivors disappear by @entity11 state authorities			1
it 's hard to imagine how bad the circumstances must be for a person to decide that the most effective way they can make their views known is to wrap barbed wire around their body -- so that burning clothes can not be pulled off them -- drink gasoline , pour it over themselves , light the fuel and be consumed by fire			0
tibetans ca n't vote , their petitions to government are ignored , protest of any kind is criminalized and , once imprisoned , most @entity6 are denied a lawyer			1
without legal or political recourse to address their grievances , they risk their lives , their liberty and the safety of their families to protest @entity49 's occupation of @entity12			1
this goes some way to explain why more than 90 tibetans from all walks of life have called for freedom by setting themselves on fire -- all other avenues have proved futile			0
there are thousands more who have protested in other ways			0
@entity49 has responded not by negotiating , but by perpetrating further violations of @entity6 ' human rights in efforts to stamp out dissent , which is deemed a threat to " @entity49			1
" we have seen military and security forces descend in large numbers on places where self - immolations have taken place			0
over much of the last year and a half , since a young monk called @entity76 set fire to himself there , the @entity11 military have lined the streets of the town of @entity81 ; road blocks restricting people 's movements			1
@entity12 has received reports of security forces ransacking homes , beating people in their houses and in public in a show of force and intimidation of the community			1
people suspected of being involved with those who have set fire to themselves are criminalized			0
rewards -- the equivalent of a generous annual salary -- are on offer for information about collaborators , and anyone suspected of collaboration can expect to receive a prison sentence of up to 13 years			0
@entity12 has documented a number of incidents of collective punishment of communities where protests have taken place			1
last month , a public information broadcast on @entity6 television outlined , in great detail , collective punishment measures for communities where self - immolations take place : the families of those who set fire to themselves will have any state benefits removed , communities where protests take place will not receive investment for local projects for three years ; government officials will be " removed			1
" although protests by fire have captured the attention of the international media , there are other protests across @entity12 that have not gained such coverage			1
thousands , from school children to the elderly , are engaging in peaceful protests			0
they have been shot at -- some killed , many more wounded -- by @entity11 security forces			2
over five days in january , in three separate incidents , @entity12 received reports that five @entity6 were shot dead , many more wounded , when security forces opened fire on peaceful protesters			1
we believe those suspected of involvement in the protests have been rounded up and detained in their hundreds ; scores have been disappeared ; many have been tortured and some have died while in detention , most likely from the wounds they sustained during torture			0
@entity160 , a 17 - year - old girl , was beaten and detained by security forces for throwing @entity164 writings in the air and calling for the release of political prisoners			2
her protest lasted five minutes ; her sentence , after having been disappeared for several months , is three years in prison			0
the rest of the world knows very little about the situation in @entity12 because few places today , except perhaps @entity175 , are so effectively cut off from the rest of the world			1
internet and mobile phone signals are routinely blocked , particularly in areas where protests take place			0
when they are n't blocked they are tightly monitored and @entity6 suspected of " sharing information " are regularly disappeared or detained and receive up to life imprisonment just for sending an e-mail			2
one @entity6 , who declined to be identified , recently told us : " i really do n't have the courage to sacrifice my life with immolation but i can spend time in @entity11 jail for passing on the truth			1
" human rights monitors and international diplomats are refused entry to @entity12 and the international media are banned			2
the only journalists who have reported from @entity12 over the last two years have done so by entering the country undercover , hidden on the back seats of cars			2
even then , most only manage to film through a car window			0
all these impediments make securing and verifying information an extremely dangerous job for anyone inside the country , and a constant challenge for organizations like @entity12			2
@entity12 ensures that governments do know what is happening in @entity12 , despite @entity49 's best efforts to gloss over and conceal the truth			2
sadly , many countries choose to turn a blind eye			0
we welcome steps taken by the @entity220 -- for instance ambassador to @entity49 @entity223 's public statement urging @entity224 to negotiate with the @entity6 people to address policy failures in @entity12 -- but there is so much more that the international community must do if @entity6 are to enjoy the freedoms so many of us take for granted			1
* please note @entity1 has offered the @entity11 government a chance to comment but we have not yet received a response			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity235 .			0

@entity12 : we have seen protesters die from their injuries , survivors disappear by authorities
as many as 29 @entity6 have self - immolated in protest against @entity11 rule , group says
without legal or political recourse to address their grievances , they risk their lives , says @entity235
@entity235 : @entity253 remains largely *unaware* of the situation as the region is effectively cut off
