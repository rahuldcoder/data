-- the @entity1 said tuesday that they have joined the @entity2 in investigating allegations that @entity5 general manager @entity4 had the ability to eavesdrop on opposing coaches for nearly three seasons			1
" by placing an investigator with the @entity2 team , we 'll go through the allegations and see where they take us			0
all we have now are allegations of illegal use of wiretapping and eavesdropping , " @entity1 superintendent @entity13 said			0
when asked specifically whether the allegations involve @entity4 , he responded , " yes			1
" @entity19 reported this week that the @entity5 manager had a device in his @entity23 suite that was wired to allow him to hear members of the opposing coaching staff from 2002 to 2004			1
the stadium suffered severe damage in 2005 , when @entity28 ripped through the city			0
citing anonymous sources , the report said it could not determine for certain whether @entity4 ever used the system			1
on monday , @entity5 spokesman @entity33 called the report " 1,000 % false -- completely inaccurate			1
" " we asked @entity19 to provide us evidence to support their allegations , and they refused			2
the team and @entity4 are seeking all legal recourse regarding these false allegations , " he said			1
interim head coach @entity42 addressed the report tuesday , calling it " ludicrous , " " juvenile " and " irresponsible			1
" " it 's absolutely ludicrous			2
it 's impossible , " he said about the wiretapping allegations			0
" that 's something from ' @entity50			0
' " @entity51 , former @entity5 coach and current defensive coordinator for the @entity53 , similarly cast doubt on the @entity19 report			1
" at no time during my tenure as head coach with the @entity5 did @entity4 and i discuss monitoring opposing team coach 's communication , nor did i have any knowledge of this			1
to my knowledge this concept was never discussed or utilized , " he said in a statement			0
the statue of limitations for wiretapping crimes is typically five years , according to @entity0 legal analyst @entity70			0
when asked how that fact might figure into the investigation , @entity13 said , " let 's find out that if the allegations are factual and if state law has been compromised first			0
then it will be up to the @entity78 attorney or district attorney to review the matter			0
" a spokesman for the @entity82 said monday that the league had no prior knowledge of the wiretapping accusations , which come on the heels of another @entity5 scandal			1
this month , the @entity82 upheld penalties it imposed against the @entity5 and members of its coaching staff for the team 's bounty program			1
the unprecedented punishment was handed down in march after an @entity82 investigation found that the team had an " active bounty program " during the 2009 , 2010 and 2011 seasons			1
during this time , players were purportedly offered payments if they managed to hurt opposing players and knock them out of a game			2
the stiffest penalty handed down -- an indefinite ban -- was given to @entity104 , the @entity5 defensive coordinator who , over the offseason , moved to take that same position with the @entity107			2
head coach @entity108 was suspended for the entire 2012 - 13 season			1
@entity4 was suspended without pay for the season 's first eight regular - season games , while @entity42 was suspended without pay for the first six regular - season games			2
the team was also fined $ 500,000 and ordered to forfeit its second - round draft picks in 2012 and 2013 , the @entity82 has said			0
the league may consider " modifying the forfeiture " of the 2013 draft pick , assuming other conditions are met , it has said			0
the @entity82 has yet to impose penalties against individual players involved in the bounty program , but commissioner @entity124 said tuesday that they , too , bear some of the responsibility			1
" the evidence is quite clear that the players embraced this			0
they put the vast majority of the money into the program , and they actually are the ones playing the game , " he said during an @entity133 interview			2
" i think everyone bears responsibility here			0
we 've held the executives and the coaches to a higher standard , but the players need to recognize , they need to make sure this is n't happening either			2
" @entity0 's @entity149 contributed to this report .			0
