-- early in @entity4 's vivid , incisive , but half - cocked gangster opus " @entity5 , " @entity2 's @entity1 returns to jail a few scant months after leaving it			1
@entity2 plays the charismatic @entity1 in " @entity5			1
" only this time he 's just visiting -- and he 's taking his friends out with him			0
it 's an audacious opening gambit , and when the getaway gets messy -- one of the gang panics and soon bullets are flying all over the place -- we glimpse another insight into what makes @entity1 tick			1
as he clings to a wounded comrade for dear life , and stares death long in the face , he has to make a decision : what to do with the guy who panicked and brought this upon them ? @entity1 lets him go			2
based on @entity28 's well - sourced account of the depression - era crime wave that gave rise not only to @entity1 , but also to a whole gallery of criminal poster boys -- @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , the @entity37 gang , @entity38 -- " @entity5 " whittles the book down to its most dramatic duel : the nationwide manhunt for @entity1 presided over by @entity42 ( a knockout @entity44 ) and led by his @entity47 , @entity46 , bureau chief , @entity45 ( @entity48 )			1
@entity1 and @entity45 assumed folk - hero proportions in their day			2
according to @entity28 , when newsreels showed @entity1 -- public enemy no. 1 -- he was applauded more loudly than the president			2
a 20th - century @entity52 , he was an underdog with a reputation for fairness			0
it was said he never killed anybody , and he was gallant and jocular with members of the public , once offering his overcoat to a kidnapped bank teller he had taken as a human shield			0
the role is tailor - made for a self - styled rebel like @entity2			2
he understands the outlaw 's swagger , the ferocity that sits hand in glove with his soft - spoken sensitivity			0
all the romance in the picture comes from @entity2 : the graceful ease with which he vaults a bank railing , his astonishing self - confidence and his dedicated courtship of hat - check girl @entity77 ( an eager @entity78 )			1
she 's swept up less by the high life he promises than the passionate conviction of his pitch			0
@entity28 paints @entity45 as an ineffectual , even inept agent who was fortunate to be in the right place at the right time to nab @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity1			2
the movie has no truck with such revisionism , but betrays little interest in @entity48 's dour , narrow lawman			1
the film 's parallel cop - and - robber structure recalls @entity4 's modern classic , " @entity94			2
" @entity45 and @entity1 meet only once -- to talk -- and then face off just once more , at the climax , to kill and be killed			2
if the confrontation of @entity48 and @entity2 does n't pack the same iconic punch as " @entity94 's " @entity101 and @entity102 , the ( entirely fictitious ) exchange in a @entity98 jail cell remains central to the film			1
at one point , @entity1 reprimands @entity45 for shooting down @entity34 , extending the poetic license still further -- as a point of historical fact @entity34 died several months after @entity1 , and though @entity45 was at the scene he almost certainly did n't pull the trigger			0
but @entity45 did coordinate the execution of @entity1 , an assassination as much as it was an attempted arrest , and maybe the nastiest crime in the picture			0
so when the incarcerated @entity2 advises the @entity116 that he should find a different line of work for his own peace of mind , his words carry a certain weight			0
still , the movie 's resolve to take @entity1 at face value feels a bit perfunctory , even old hat			1
at 140 minutes it takes a long time to find its rhythm ; indeed , this is one film that would be better if it were 20 minutes longer			0
still , there 's little here that @entity134 did n't anticipate 40 years ago in " @entity38 , " except maybe the intriguing idea that organized crime pulled the plug on the old - style go - it - alone bank robber in a belated attempt to forestall @entity42 's dream of a federal law enforcement agency			1
for all its loving period detail , the movie scarcely notices the desperate poverty of the times			0
shot largely on high definition video , " @entity5 " does n't look like the old gangster films -- it looks like tv			1
the images gain in immediacy what is lost in luster , but left this spectator looking for more texture , more depth -- more heat			0
ireport.com : @entity2 's best film ? one of the new @entity161 's last great stylists , @entity4 is well aware of the sacrifice involved in this transition			1
you can see it in the loving way he pictures @entity2 's doomed @entity1 watching @entity169 's doomed gangster embrace his fate in " @entity171 " while @entity45 and his deputies assume their places outside @entity47 's @entity174			1
there is something ritualistic about this sequence , as if @entity1 divines some measure of grace from the screen , and we congregants also play our part			0
the faces change , but it 's the same old movie we remember .			0

" @entity5 " is a solid gangster flick that 's not quite great , says @entity188
@entity190 stars @entity2 as bank robber @entity1
@entity2 is terrific , @entity48 as @entity193 man is more *colorless*
