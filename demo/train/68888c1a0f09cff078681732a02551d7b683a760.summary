@entity0 -- when @entity2 won the @entity3 , a warmup event for january 's @entity5 , few were surprised			1
but what followed was largely out of character for a man who is perceived as one of the more dour characters in the world of sport			2
after winning the final , @entity2 turned towards the television cameras and showed a side of himself that had so rarely been seen			1
" i 'd like to dedicate this victory to one of my best friends , " the @entity18 tennis star told the crowd			2
" he 's back home watching and you 're going to get through			2
" thousands of miles away in @entity0 , @entity2 's former roommate @entity25 sat facing the prospect of six months of grueling chemotherapy after being diagnosed with @entity29 's lymphoma -- a cancer of the lymph node immune system			1
friends since their early years and former doubles partners , the two were inseparable on and off the court , with both taking time to tease one another about their receding hairlines			2
but not even @entity25 , who has seen a side of @entity2 that few others have caught a glimpse of , expected such a gesture			1
" i did n't expect the speech , that 's for sure , " the @entity43 told @entity1 's @entity44			0
" i just expected him to , well i was hoping he would win the title ... we had been very close that week as we always are			2
" so i was watching the speech and was thinking how pleased i was he had won , and then he came and dedicated his trophy , which meant the world to me			2
" it 's something which lifted me up and it meant a lot because it was a big stage leading into a grand slam			0
" my fiancee cried and she does n't cry that much			0
it was a very special moment for us , it was something we shared together and it was something we 'll never forget			0
" it was a rare moment of emotion from @entity2 , who has often been derided for his downbeat personality			1
the tears which followed his defeat by @entity68 in last year 's @entity70 final finally allowed the public a glimpse of what lay behind a perceived deadpan exterior			0
his victory on the same court at the @entity77 was then followed by his first grand slam triumph at the @entity79 last september -- a day that @entity25 will never forget			1
having been two sets ahead of world @entity81 in the final at @entity84 , @entity2 allowed his rival to fight back and move level before triumphing in a pulsating final set			1
" he was so determined to win that match , i do n't think we can ever appreciate what was going through his head , " said @entity25			1
" everyone in the world that had watched him over the last final finals was thinking , ' oh it 's going to happen again			0
' " but he would n't let it and it was a joy to watch			0
it was an incredible moment when he picked up the trophy			0
" a friend in need while @entity2 had triumphed and defeated his demons , @entity25 was just beginning his own personal battle that same month			1
searing back pains prevented him from sleeping for more than two hours , and left him in absolute agony			0
so severe was his sleep deprivation that @entity25 tried everything from laying out on the wooden floor in his bathroom , to sleeping on a foam roller covered with tennis balls			1
it was only after speaking to a coach at a training camp in @entity117 , @entity118 , that @entity25 began to realize the severity of the situation			1
after initial tests showed pneumonia in his left lung , @entity25 sought further medical advice about an enlarged lymph node in his chest , which turned out to be cancerous			1
@entity29 's lymphoma is a cancer of the white blood cell found in the lymphatic system , which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body			2
its most common symptom is a painless swelling in a lymph node , normally in the neck , armpit or groin			0
the day his diagnosis was confirmed -- december 27 , 2012 -- is etched into @entity25 ' memory			1
" i called @entity2 and spoke to him about it , " said @entity25 , who got engaged to his longtime girlfriend @entity144 in february			1
" @entity2 was saying , ' you 're going to be better after this , you 're going to be stronger , you 're going to be a far tougher person and tennis player			1
' " obviously my fiancee was upset			0
i 'd actually warned her that it was going to be this			0
" she was amazing , she 'd been through cancer in her family with one of her parents so she knew what it was all about , so she was like a rock for me			2
" i love her to bits and i ca n't thank her enough			0
she was great and she was supportive , but that was initially a tough moment			0
" support @entity25 has been overwhelmed with messages of support from well wishers from across the world since he announced his condition at the end of last year			1
far from being a household name in the world of tennis , the 28 - year - old , who grew up a stone 's throw away from @entity70 , can barely believe the public 's reaction			0
" it 's something that i ca n't really express in words , " said @entity25			2
" i 've still got all the letters and all the cards in my living room and they mean so much to me			0
" people who have taken time from three - year - old kids who have written or drawn pictures to me , to people who have done montages , it 's been incredible			0
a lot of them will remain in my heart forever , because it 's something you do n't expect			0
" @entity2 , in particular , has been a rock for @entity25 -- showing a more sensitive side than their usual joking banter			1
" we do n't normally have too many serious conversations , " he added			0
" i 've needed a different side of @entity2 but we 're closer than ever			2
" recovery @entity25 completed his chemotherapy sessions last week and was courtside as @entity2 won the @entity203 at @entity204 on sunday			1
the two appeared on court , after the world @entity208 's final win over @entity210 , at the @entity212 charity match alongside @entity213 , @entity2 's coach @entity214 , @entity215 and a host of celebrities			1
@entity2 donated his $ 115,000 winner 's prize to the charity , which supports the @entity221 where @entity25 was treated			1
" @entity25 has handled it all so well , " @entity2 told @entity1 in his typical understated manner			1
" he has a great family and he 's been so positive			0
hopefully he 'll go for his scan and it will all be ok			0
" @entity25 will be tested in mid-july to see if the cancer has been defeated , while a final verdict will come in late september or october following another scan			1
best man after that , there is the small matter of his wedding at the end of november , at which @entity2 will be best man			1
@entity2 is taking charge of planning the bachelor party along with @entity25 ' brother -- a task he was expecting , according to his close friend			1
" i think @entity2 kind of knew it was coming , " said @entity25			1
" when i got engaged i think he knew it was going to be him and then i said to him , ' you know it would mean a lot to me , ' knowing how supportive he has been over the years			0
" he kind of jumped to it , he was like ' great , it means a lot to me , let 's do it and let me know if you need me for anything else			0
' " and he probably says that a lot at the moment and i am using him a lot			0
" ' superstar ' @entity25 believes his friend has all the attributes to become " a great champion " as he begins his bid next week to become @entity18 's first @entity70 men 's winner since @entity263 in 1936			2
" you dream about being able to time the ball that sweetly and to have the precision that he has , " says @entity25			2
" mentally he 's so strong , he 's able to rise to occasions and serve aces on break points , he 's able to capitalize when he senses his opponent is struggling with a certain tactic			0
" he is a superstar , he 's a master tactician , and he 's as feisty and competitive as they come			0

@entity25 gives a rare *insight* into the life of @entity2
