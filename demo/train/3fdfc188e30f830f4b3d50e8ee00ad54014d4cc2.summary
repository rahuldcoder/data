a small town in @entity1 is a far cry from the civil war - ravaged fields of northern @entity4			1
but for @entity6 , a former @entity7 solider , the battlefield feels most like home			1
for the last month , @entity6 , 28 , has been a volunteer fighter in the @entity10 militia known here as the @entity11 , or @entity11			1
the group has been defending three small @entity10 statelets in northern @entity4			1
the @entity10 militants have also spent much of the last year battling @entity15 , the hardline jihadist group that wants to create an @entity17 state across parts of @entity19 and @entity4			1
" due to two years of almost no foreign policy in the region -- while these people threatened @entity7 citizens , and bring harm to us -- i think i decided enough was enough , and i decided to come out this way , " @entity6 said			1
he saw the fall of @entity19 's second - largest city , @entity29 , as a turning point			2
" all of the @entity7 brothers that have died over there -- all the @entity7 veterans that have died over there -- and paid their lives for that country so they could have a democracy			1
that just resonated in my mind			0
and i could n't live with myself letting that country fall , and all my brothers ' lives be for nothing , " @entity6 said			1
but instead of ending up in @entity19 , @entity6 joined the @entity11 in @entity4			1
it marked a dramatic turn for the former soldier			0
during more than two years in the @entity7 military , @entity6 says , he never saw combat , nor was he shipped overseas to serve			1
in @entity4 , he saw action almost as soon as he arrived			1
two days after reaching the @entity10 enclave known as @entity50 , he says , he was hit by a mortar round during a firefight with @entity15			2
now mostly recovered from shrapnel wounds , but still squinting occasionally from the wounds caused by the dirt that the mortar shell sprayed in his eye , @entity6 met @entity58 in the ypg - controlled town of @entity60			2
" all my life , i 've wanted to be a soldier			2
so it just fits well over here , " he said			0
" i 'm at peace being here			0
" ' taking the fight to the enemy ' @entity6 is from @entity68 , @entity1 , a " mom and pop town " as he described it , with just a few restaurants and three gas stations			2
he worked the third shift at a food packaging company but missed military life			2
@entity6 said he was honorably discharged from the @entity76 in 2007			1
because of problems with his record , he says the military refused to take him back , despite his multiple efforts to re-enlist			0
" civilian life just was n't for me			1
the normal 9 - to - 5 , i just was n't comfortable with it , " he said			0
" over here , everything makes sense			0
" @entity6 got in contact with the @entity11 on @entity87			2
he prayed about what to do for a month or two , he said , before making the leap			0
he flew to @entity90 , where he was picked up and taken to @entity50 , a @entity10 - controlled area of northern @entity4			2
@entity6 misses a few things about the @entity7 : hamburgers , toilets , rock ' n ' roll			1
but he would n't change where he is for anything			0
he speaks about the @entity10 movement with the fervor of a recent convert			0
" it 's for these people that i 'm doing this			0
yes , it does help @entity7 back home , because we 're taking the fight to the enemy here , so they ca n't take it to us			1
so it 's that to a degree			0
but , for me , it 's for the @entity10 people , " @entity6 said			1
@entity7 airdrops give much needed aid in @entity115 , but did @entity15 get some ? foreign fighters @entity7 law enforcement officials say it 's illegal for an @entity7 to join a @entity4 militia , just as it is for an @entity7 to join @entity15			1
according to intelligence estimates , more than 100 of the foreign fighters for @entity15 in @entity4 have come from the @entity7			1
@entity123 authorities believe that 130 @entity123 citizens are taking part in jihad			0
hundreds more have traveled from @entity128			0
thousands come from the @entity130 and @entity131			0
when asked whether he saw any parallels between those foreign jihadi fighters and himself , @entity6 said there 's nothing he can do to change their minds			1
" they 've come here to push an agenda , to push one way of life over people who do not want it			0
and i will not sit and stand by while people like that take those actions , " he said			0
he says he believes the @entity7 government is watching what he does , but will not consider him a terrorist , nor deny him re-entry			2
if that happens , however , @entity6 says he could just stay in @entity152			2
" once this fight is over , and @entity15 has been crippled , then the next stage of my life , then i 'll think about that , " he said			1
after the rescue : a @entity160 family 's harrowing flight to escape @entity15 ' someone has to do it ' since recovering from his wounds , @entity6 has been working to bring other foreign fighters to @entity4			1
he says he 's recruiting for the ypg on social media			0
most of the people interested are former military , he said			0
" i 've had ex-military ask from @entity128 , @entity170 , @entity123 , the @entity7 , @entity171 , you name it			2
@entity15 has threatened all these countries that i 've named to push their agenda in those nations , and the veterans of those nations who love their countries do n't want to sit by while this is happening , " he said			1
the @entity11 are lightly armed guerrilla fighters			0
most lack helmets and armor			0
they rely heavily on @entity188 assault rifles			0
but their ranks have also been reinforced by @entity152 from @entity90 , many of whom are veterans of a 30 - year guerrilla war fought between the @entity90 state and a sister organization to the @entity11 known as the @entity196 , or @entity196			0
the @entity7 , the @entity197 and @entity90 officially list the @entity196 as a terrorist organization			2
the bloodbath in the @entity130 has blurred loyalties			0
this month , the @entity7 began providing air support to @entity11 fighters defending the @entity4 border town of @entity115 from an @entity15 siege			1
in addition to bombing @entity15 militants in and around @entity115 , @entity7 military planes parachuted weapons , ammunition and medicine to @entity11 fighters , infuriating the @entity90 government			1
@entity6 said the @entity11 could use more support on the ground , in addition to ongoing @entity7 - led airstrikes			1
although those strikes , he said , have helped to shift the balance of power on the battlefield , he stressed that a lot more needs to be done			0
as soon as he can , he says , he 'll head back to the front line			0
" the way i look at it is someone has to do it , and if we do n't fight , @entity15 will grow -- will become more well - funded -- and they will push their agenda			1
so we need men on the front to take the fight to the enemy before the enemy can take the fight to us , " @entity6 said .			2

@entity6 , a former @entity76 solider , is fighting against @entity15
he was never in combat during two years in the @entity7 military
" civilian life just was n't for me , " he says
@entity7 law enforcement officials say it 's illegal for an @entity7 to join a @entity4 militia
