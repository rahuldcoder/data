-- a 60 - day state of emergency imposed on @entity2 and several surrounding areas has come to an end , giving the tourism industry hope that lagging arrival numbers in the @entity7 will improve			1
the state of emergency came into effect on january 22 in the run - up to the february 2 general election -- held amid widespread anti-government protests throughout the city -- and gave authorities the power to impose curfews , detain suspects without court permission , censor media and declare parts of the capital off limits			2
it has been replaced with the @entity24 ( @entity25 ) , which will be in effect until april 30			0
this still gives authorities power to impose curfews , set up checkpoints and restrict the movement of demonstrators but is considered less severe			0
the @entity34 reports the @entity25 is needed to maintain law and order during the @entity38 election on march 30 and reruns of the general election , expected in april			0
the caretaker government , led by prime minister @entity42 , said the decision to lift the state of emergency a few days early was designed to reverse the negative impact @entity47 's political crisis has had on the country 's tourism industry and overall economy			1
" the use of the @entity24 will help project a positive image of @entity47 , particularly in terms of business , investment , and tourism , " said the government in a media briefing on the situation			1
tourism industry expected to recover quickly more than 20 people have been killed and hundreds wounded since protests erupted in @entity2 in november , hitting the tourism industry hard as the news made global headlines			1
the november to february period is @entity47 's tourist high season -- record numbers of visitor arrivals were anticipated			2
since the protests started , tourist arrival expectations for 2014 have been revised downward 3 % from 28.1 million ( a prediction made in july 2013 ) to 27.5 million , according to a report by the state - run @entity73 of @entity47			1
ending the emergency decree will help the tourism industry recover within a few months , it added			1
in february , demonstrations were scaled back and various protest sites throughout the city closed			0
anti-government protesters , still intent on ousting @entity42 , now congregate at central @entity2 's @entity82			2
" provided the protests remain subdued then we believe tourism in @entity2 ( it was relatively unaffected in the rest of the country and in the beach resorts ) will gradually pick up , " @entity83 , head of equities at @entity85 , told @entity0			2
the lifting of the emergency degree should also have a positive impact on the conference and incentive travel business , which brings a lot of high end travelers to @entity47 , he said			1
" these trips are generally discretionary travel or can be relocated quite easily , " said @entity83			0
" they are extremely sensitive to political disturbances or health issues like @entity104 and avian flu			0
" insurance is another major issue for many tour groups , as travel insurance tends to be invalidated by civil disturbances and a state of emergency would meet the definition of most policies , he said			2
" even though a tourist 's chances of being killed or injured in a protest are slight , it happened to several in 1991 , and most tour operators wo n't take any chances			0
there is also the risk of being stuck , if airports are shut down			0
" travel advisories now a key issue " the removal of the state of emergency decree is clearly encouraging for @entity130 stakeholders , " @entity125 , ceo of the @entity126 ( @entity126 ) , told @entity0			1
" however the key issue is how this will effect travel advisories			1
" @entity83 had a similar take			0
" @entity47 would want to see either a lifting or easing of the travel warnings issued by various embassies , this should help [ win ] back the mass market tourists , especially from @entity138 who are more concerned with safety than a cheap room , " he said			1
" these warnings were in relation to the street protests , not the @entity145 itself			0
" more than 40 countries issued warnings to their citizens relating to @entity2 since protests began in november			2
in january , @entity151 gave the @entity47 capital a " black " designation -- a dubious honor shared only with @entity155 , the @entity156 and @entity157			0
@entity125 says @entity126 research showed air travel bookings from @entity151 to @entity47 went down in january over 50 %			1
on wednesday , @entity151 updated its warning			0
" in view of the latest situation in @entity2 , and the fact that the state of emergency in @entity2 and the surrounding provinces was lifted by the @entity167 , the @entity151 government today ( march 19 ) adjusted the @entity168 ( @entity169 ) for @entity47 ( @entity2 ) to amber -- the same as for other parts of @entity47 , " said a government spokesman			1
@entity47 's @entity172 is reportedly now planning a large marketing campaign to promote the country globally			0
the main theme will be " @entity47 : @entity176 ( bff )			0
" " while the state of emergency has caused little inconvenience to travelers to @entity47 , its lifting is a sign that things are fast returning to normal in @entity2 , " said @entity177 , governor of the @entity172 of @entity47 .			1
