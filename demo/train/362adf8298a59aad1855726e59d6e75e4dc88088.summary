-- there is a growing interest among @entity4 foreign policy officials and scholars in deterring @entity6 ; that is , in tolerating a nuclear armed @entity6 but keeping it at bay by threatening it in kind should it use its nuclear weapons			1
although the @entity14 administration has not embraced this position , some observers believe this is the direction it is headed			0
one indication comes from @entity19 , the national security adviser			0
in a speech late last year , he remarked , " we will continue to build a regional defense architecture that prevents @entity6 from threatening its neighbors			2
we will continue to deepen @entity6 's isolation , regionally and globally			1
" and a recent report sponsored by the @entity26 outlines a strategy for deterrence that includes expanding the @entity4 ' regional nuclear presence and improving @entity4 missile defense capabilities			1
as one expert puts it , " deterrence against a nuclear @entity6 should not be terribly difficult			2
" for deterrence to work , the leaders of the nations that command nuclear arms must be rational			1
the champions of deterrence claim to demonstrate that @entity6 's leaders are not insane by showing that they react in sensible ways to changes in the world around them			1
for instance , after the @entity4 military easily wiped out @entity47 's army in @entity48 and president @entity49 told @entity6 it was on the very short list of members in the " @entity53 , " @entity6 made a very conciliatory offer regarding its nuclear program			1
in short , proponents of deterrence argue that leaders and governments in fact do respond to changes with reason and logic			2
however , there 's another type of decision - making process that sociologists have known about			0
it 's nonrational behavior , such as when people act in response to deeply held beliefs that can not be proven or disproven			0
people have long shown they are willing to kill or be killed for their beliefs , and that @entity75 commanded them to act in a particular manner			0
they may respond to facts and pressures , but only as long as those factors affect the ways they implement their beliefs -- but not the beliefs themselves			0
thus , a religiously fanatical @entity6 leader who believes that @entity75 commanded him to wipe out @entity84 may calculate whether to use missiles or bombers and in what season to attack , but not whether to heed @entity75 's command to destroy the infidels			2
an example of nonrational thinking is summed up best in these words : " [ @entity6 's ] religious zealotry causes it to exaggerate the significance of issues that are , objectively speaking , only tangentially related to its interests			1
the @entity101 - @entity100 conflict , for instance , has no direct bearing on @entity6 's security , but much of the regime sees it as fundamental to @entity6 interests and even to @entity6 's identity as a @entity108 nation			1
" even rational heads of states have shown themselves in the past to be fully capable of making gross miscalculations that cost them their lives , regimes and all they were fighting for			1
@entity117 would fall in that category			0
similarly , the @entity119 , when they attacked @entity121 , believed they would be able at least to drive the @entity4 out of their part of the world			2
@entity47 believed the @entity4 would not invade @entity48 in 2003 , but he was dead wrong			0
history is littered with numerous other , though less grand , miscalculations , from @entity128 's @entity127 in the @entity129 to @entity130 in the @entity131			0
in short , it might be possible to deter @entity6 , but no one can assume that we can safely rely on the rationality of @entity6 's leaders and their decisions and reactions to the events around them			1
no one can predict if they will unleash forces on @entity143 or @entity101 -- perhaps not even the @entity6 themselves			0
follow @entity144 on @entity145 join the conversation on @entity147 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity150 .			0

@entity150 : there is growing interest among @entity4 officials , scholars in deterring @entity6
for deterrence to work , leaders of nations with nuclear arms must be rational , he says
@entity150 : even rational heads of states have made gross miscalculations
he says no one can assume that we can safely rely on the rationality of @entity6 's leaders
