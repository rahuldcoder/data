-- thursday night 's @entity2 presidential debate in @entity3 , @entity4 , sponsored by @entity0 , will be one of more than 20 such encounters in the past nine months			0
beltway conventional wisdom says there have been too many debates			1
with a slight too - cool - for - school groan and accompanying eye - roll , the argument goes like this : the debates have taken up too much time for the candidates and their campaigns ; they distract from retail campaigning and fundraising ; they give the media too much of a role in the voters ' vetting process			1
but i take a different view : the debates have been a valuable addition to this election cycle			1
and two - thirds of @entity31 primary voters seem to agree , saying that the debates played an important role in helping them make up their minds			1
expensive television ads , in contrast , seem to have lost some power of persuasion			0
this is a good thing -- the debates have imposed an unprecedented degree of transparency and accountability on this @entity2 presidential race			1
on a debate stage , standing side by side with their competitors , candidates have not been able to entirely hide behind huge sums of money , super pacs , or television ads. they have been judged by the voters based on their working knowledge of policy and their ability to think and speak on their feet			1
it is a good test of presidential mettle -- and character is revealed as well as intellect over the course of the debates			1
no one can say that the debates have n't had an impact			1
@entity69 probably regrets his premature decision to get out of the race after the @entity72			0
but it was his failure to repeat a clever line about " @entity76 " to @entity78 's face that caused many voters and donors to conclude that he did n't have the toughness to take on the top job			0
@entity83 entered the campaign in august as the savior conservatives were looking for , fulfilling a litmus test checklist of fiscal and social conservative positions that seemed to also resonate with the tea party			0
in his @entity90 re-election effort , @entity83 had stopped talking to editorial boards as part of a pushback on " media elites " -- but he could n't avoid the debates			1
and once in them , he could n't avoid his propensity to stumble over his own tongue			0
a few epic brain freezes later , @entity83 's reputation as a political heavyweight was done			0
@entity103 's rise to top - two status is almost entirely due to strong debate performances , balancing @entity2 red - meat rhetoric with thoughtful policy prescriptions			1
yes , it 's true that some his best moments have come when he defiantly pushed back on questions and got the audience loudly on his side , but that was a measure of his ability to connect with voters by voicing their frustrations			0
he rose from the political dead not with money or organization , but with what he carried into the debates			2
@entity78 succeeded in gliding through the first dozen debates as the de facto front - runner , as other candidates seemed reluctant to take him on hard			1
he consequently was able to focus his attacks on president @entity126 -- a strategy that served him well for a while , by reminding the @entity2 base that at least they had one thing in common with @entity78 : a dislike bordering on disrespect for the president			0
but it was the insistence from other candidates during the debates that @entity78 release his tax returns that made the @entity139 and the " carried interest " tax provision subjects of interest during the campaign			1
and @entity149 and @entity150 's debate performances have enabled them to attract new supporters , speaking their respective truths to mass audiences they might not have otherwise reached			2
to top it off , these debates have been widely watched -- by more than 50 million @entity155 to date			2
that 's voting with your eyeballs			0
and even if this presidential campaign has occasionally come too close to resembling a reality show , at least there is a core civic component beneath the conflict			0
the substance from the debates has driven the campaign news cycle			2
i understand that for campaign managers and some candidates , a schedule of debate after debate is a hassle that cuts into their fundraising time			2
they have to study up and learn policy , realizing that they 'll get called out for repeating the kind of bumper - sticker lies they routinely get away with as part of their stump speech			0
but it 's also the best chance to get their message to the widest number of people -- and that 's what campaigns at their core are about			2
the fact that there is a risk involved in debates just reflects the real stakes of the race for the most powerful job on earth			2
tuesday night 's debate will be the last one for almost a month			0
february has a few scattered caucuses and primaries , but the next real prize is @entity206 in early march			0
and i expect that voters will miss the debates and the clarifying role they can play			1
front - runners will want to avoid the accountability and scrutiny they provide , but it 's a vital chance for voters to judge the candidates directly , adding light to the heat of the presidential primary gauntlet			0
