-- @entity2 coach @entity1 will lead his @entity4 team into their first @entity6 final in 38 years on 22 may			1
his task will be to drive @entity2 to their first @entity6 title since 1965 by defeating @entity10 champions @entity9 at the @entity11 in @entity12 this saturday			2
like @entity9 coach @entity14 , the 47 - year - old is targeting a treble , having already secured the @entity17 and @entity6 titles this year			0
a victory for the @entity4 would also signal a second treble for @entity1 who last achieved the three required victories at @entity22 back in 2004			1
can @entity1 beat @entity14 to become king of @entity24 ? @entity2 's run to the final of the @entity24 competition was made all the more impressive with a win over title holders @entity30 in the semifinal			1
record after promising but brief spells coaching at @entity37 sides @entity33 and @entity34 , @entity1 brought home his first silverware while in charge at @entity22 where he claimed the league and cup titles in his first year , and treble in the second			1
@entity1 then moved on to @entity44 side @entity43 where he won six trophies in his three years at the helm , including the league titles in 2005 and 2006 and the @entity48 and @entity49 in 2007			2
since 2008 @entity1 has been at @entity2 where he won the @entity51 title in his first year as coach , successfully defending the title in 2010 as well as winning the domestic cup			1
if the team go on to win the @entity6 final , it will be the first time the @entity2 side has done so since they beat @entity33 in the final in 1965			1
perhaps the most impressive stat to @entity1 's name is his run of 136 unbeaten home matches across his reigns at @entity2 , @entity43 and @entity22 -- his last league defeat on home turf coming at @entity22 in 2002			1
personality " do n't call me arrogant , but i 'm @entity24 champion and i think i 'm a special one , " were the first words spoken by @entity1 upon his arrival at @entity43 in 2004 , and he has since been dubbed " @entity1 " by the @entity71 press			0
@entity1 has never failed to provide the media with entertaining press conferences and many memorable quotes though such outspoken comments have caused trouble down the years as well as making @entity1 a big personality			0
however , his ambition on the football field can not be underestimated and there is speculation that @entity1 might leave @entity2 for @entity12 after the final			2
he has been quoted in the past as saying he has dreams of coaching in @entity87 , @entity4 and @entity88 , so it would not be a surprise if his next challenge was at the @entity92			0
previous clashes @entity1 learnt his trade working as assistants at @entity96 , @entity22 and @entity30			2
at the @entity88 club he was first a translator for @entity71 manager @entity99 and then second in command to @entity101 , who he says he learnt a lot from in the early stages of his career			0
" @entity14 is a very confident person and at a moment when a coach like me was young , that was very important			0
he gave me the confidence to coach the team on the pitch , " @entity1 said			2
the rivalry between the pair intensified when @entity1 became the first coach in history to guide three different teams to the semifinals of the @entity6 -- only for @entity14 to do the same a day later			2
and whoever finishes on top on saturday will join an even more elite group of those to have coached more than one team to the final of the competition			0
@entity125 @entity124 and @entity10 @entity126 are the only two coaches to have done so in the past			0
whether or not he can do it this weekend @entity1 is confident that he will at some point in his career			0
" i will do it one day , but i would love to do it now because of the circumstances of @entity2 not winning the competition for a long time			0
" tactics @entity1 has been praised for his team 's resilience in the second leg of the @entity6 semifinal against @entity30 , when despite being reduced to 10 men they still managed to keep the @entity88 challenge at bay and go through 3 - 2 on aggregate			1
the @entity2 coach is reported to be a big fan of long fitness sessions and punishing long training runs to keep his squad in shape -- a technique also used by @entity14 -- and it is this which is thought to have helped get @entity1 's side through to the final			1
he will be hoping that this will also stand them in good stead in the final against @entity9 , especially as like the @entity10 team who are without @entity162 , they will be missing a key player through suspension -- midfielder @entity165			0
@entity1 will be looking to veteran captain @entity166 , @entity168 playmaker @entity167 and @entity170 striker @entity169 -- who has won two @entity6 titles with @entity30 in 2006 and 2009 -- to take him to victory in the competition that he has described as " even bigger than the @entity174			1

@entity2 coach @entity1 will lead his @entity4 team into their first @entity6 final in 38 years
@entity1 's last defeat on home turf in the league was with @entity22 in 2002
the @entity37 has described the event as " even bigger than the @entity174 "
