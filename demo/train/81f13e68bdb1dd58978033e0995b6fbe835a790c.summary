-- @entity2 ' @entity1 is becoming less and less about photographing the road to grandma 's house and more about getting you off the road entirely			1
the tech giant 's latest project , unveiled monday , takes mapping initiatives to new and extreme heights by offering interactive galleries of some of the world 's tallest mountains			0
the views include four famous peaks from across the globe : the snow - capped @entity19 in @entity22 's @entity21 , dormant volcano @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25 in @entity26 and @entity27 in @entity29 ' home country of @entity30			1
users can drop into various camps and viewing locations along the mountains to explore 360 - degree panoramas and trace the paths of some mountains ' trails with just a few clicks			1
" it feels like you 're walking through the gates of hell because there are mule skeletons sticking out of the ground , " @entity40 , one of the @entity2 team members who photographed all four peaks , says about his experience at @entity27			1
" it was this out - of - world experience of entering into an environment where not many people go and knowing we were going to bring back that experience for others to see			2
" ( video : @entity1 lets you explore the @entity58 ) @entity59 is a @entity60			1
that 's not his normal title — he 's a technical program manager who works on @entity2 's privacy and security team — but his love of the extreme outdoors led him and his colleagues to start organizing visits to the highest mountains throughout the past year and a half			1
as they planned , another colleague suggested using their trip as an opportunity to collaborate with the @entity2 team , and their modern - day cartography mission was born			1
@entity2 uses a variety of devices besides cars to capture footage from all over the world , including pushcart trolleys , trikes and , on occasion , snowmobiles			1
@entity90 hiking , however , required a different strategy			0
the @entity92 — the backpack camera apparatus @entity2 used to photograph its @entity58 collection , which debuted in february — had yet to be invented when @entity59 and friends set their sights on some summits			2
scaling the world 's highest peaks is also an equipment - heavy undertaking , which means lugging around backpack - sized cameras was n't feasible			2
instead , the adventurers went fairly low - tech , using an off - the - self digital camera and fish - eye lens — the same tools @entity2 's @entity109 program has used to capture the interiors of more than 100,000 businesses since it launched three years ago			1
" the fish - eye camera does allow you to get some amazing views , and it allows you to take photos a little bit more aggressively because you do n't need to stop and aim as well , " @entity59 tells time			2
" you just hold the camera in a direction , even if you 're precariously perched on the edge of a mountain			2
" ( video : @entity122 ) precarious indeed			0
the mountain peak collection was one of @entity2 's trickiest mapping projects to photograph , as the adventure team dealt with torrential downpours , mudslides and even a 6.9 - magnitute earthquake near @entity19 in the middle of the night			1
working in @entity2 's @entity134 , @entity133 headquarters means @entity59 is no stranger to @entity137 quakes , but when your lodging in @entity140 consists of seismically unsound trading posts built out of stones , natural disasters are a whole other story			2
" as i was out in the dark , you could hear people screaming and running for cover			0
that is an eye - opening experience , " @entity40 says			0
" these people accept their fate as predetermined			0
to see them panicking and fearing something , it tests your own ability to stay calm in situations like that and not panic as well			0
" the mountains ' high altitudes were another obstacle , one that required careful planning			0
at any given spot on the mountain , adventurers only need to take a few shots — three leveled photographs in each compass direction			0
but when you have to do that every 20 feet without your normal supply of oxygen , capturing the ( literally ! ) breathtaking beauty of geological wonders becomes a demanding and time - consuming task , so @entity59 and the other adventurers would meet at night to plot their itinerary , which usually began at first light			0
fortunately for them , assembling all that data back in @entity134 was a far less rigorous task : @entity2 engineers use their mapping software to link the photos to their shooting locations and string them together to create the panoramic paths users walk through			1
" the goal as a team is to make sure we had the opportunity to provide users with maps that are more accurate and usable , " @entity40 says			0
" different adventurers and people who want to explore from the comfort of their homes have the opportunity to explore and see these different corners of the world			0
