@entity0 -- @entity3 security may figure greatly in this year 's @entity5 presidential election because of urgent questions about @entity7 and enduring concerns over how best to manage a rising @entity9 and preserve @entity5 influence			1
in addition to @entity14 's looming role in the global economy , specific recent developments ensure that @entity14 will surface as an issue during the final months of the @entity5 presidential campaign			2
@entity3 security issues should be debated during the course of the election , and they will be framed in terms starkly different from those likely to be heard among @entity3 experts ruminating at a conference			1
while foreign capitals and analysts will scrutinize campaign rhetoric for clues , they would do well to remember that governing is different from campaigning			0
president @entity32 's announcement last year of a pivot to @entity14 underscores a long - term trend in which the @entity5 is gradually placing greater priority on the @entity36			0
economic power is shifting from the @entity38 to the @entity39 and @entity41 oceans , and emerging powers such as @entity9 and @entity41 are increasingly flexing their muscles as regional military and political powers			2
both @entity46 and @entity47 , and @entity48 and its smaller neighbors in @entity14 , are all , to varying degrees , responding to these trends			0
long - term plans are driven mostly by a rising @entity9 , uncertainty about @entity5 's long - term presence and increasing capacity for building local and coastal defenses and shaping regional institutions			2
@entity32 's rebalancing of priorities toward @entity14 is designed to reassure allies and new partners , without overly provoking a @entity9 vital to the global economy			0
for all its importance , however , the national political campaign has barely acknowledged the existence of @entity3 security			1
@entity9 has come under fire for currency manipulation and trading practices , and @entity7 's @entity69 managed to break into the campaign with his reckless missile launch			1
but the deeper , underlying issues of @entity3 security and their implications for the @entity5 are awaiting more deliberate consideration			1
both candidates should make it clear how @entity5 's future peace and prosperity are intertwined with the @entity36			0
here are 10 questions vital to @entity5 interests that the presidential candidates should debate : 1			0
how should the @entity5 manage relations with @entity9 ? how can the @entity5 both engage in expanded trade and cooperation and hedge against @entity9 's growing military might ? what is the best way to overcome @entity9 's increasing ability to deny @entity5 military forces access to the @entity93 and @entity92 and old @entity5 bases vulnerable throughout the @entity39 ? how can the @entity5 retain overall cooperation while pressing @entity9 on military , political and economic issues ? does @entity0 risk being perceived in @entity14 as upsetting a delicate regional balance of power ? how should the @entity5 approach @entity9 's next leadership , including both its possible purging of @entity103 's @entity102 but also its suppression of freedom ? does the recent ouster of the popular leftist politician @entity107 signify a moderating political trend or a pervasive corruption problem within the @entity9 system ? 2			1
how can the @entity5 maintain sufficient military power and presence in the region ? recent budget cuts mean the @entity115 will remain under 300 ships and that air forces will not grow at the rates projected a year ago			2
given budget constraints and limited basing options in the region , how can the @entity5 retain a favorable military balance of power in the decade ahead and beyond ? should the @entity5 further redistribute its military presence throughout the region , and , if so , where and how ? 3			2
how will the @entity5 make decisions over which arms to sell to @entity125 ? @entity9 is pressing hard to put an end to @entity5 's longstanding practice of trying to maintain a balance of power across the @entity129			1
improved cross-strait relations are in the interests of all parties , and yet they also make it more difficult to prepare for any future deterioration in relations			0
under what circumstances should the @entity5 sell @entity125 new , advanced f - 16 aircraft or assist it with stealthier defenses such as indigenous submarine production or cyberwarfare ? 4			0
what is the best strategy for checking @entity7 ambitions to build long - range missiles and nuclear weapons ? how can the @entity5 maintain deterrence and avoid miscalculation ? should missile defenses be strengthened ? should the @entity5 allow @entity47 to extend the range of its missiles from 300 to 800 kilometers ? should the @entity5 and @entity47 continue the move toward returning wartime operational control to @entity152 by the end of 2015 ? what should the @entity5 ask of @entity9 with respect to limiting @entity7 provocations ? should the @entity5 establish higher - level direct talks with @entity7 's inner circle ? what additional pressures , such as targeted financial measures , might be brought to bear on @entity7 decision - makers ? 5			1
should the @entity5 encourage @entity46 to take on more responsibility for regional security ? for example , how far should the @entity164 go toward shifting its focus on its southwestern islands as potential checks on growing @entity9 military capabilities ? should @entity46 and the @entity5 more actively pursue combined operational concepts such as @entity171 , which would seek to deploy maritime and air and possibly ground forces in tandem to counter the capabilities of potential adversaries ? are bases in @entity46 , especially the stationing of @entity180 in @entity181 , sustainable ? what should be the role of the @entity5 in defending @entity46 in the event of a conflict with @entity9 over the @entity186 in the @entity187 ? 6			1
should the @entity5 play a more active role in ensuring peace in the @entity92 ? what are the potential costs and benefits of building up the coastal defenses of nations such as the @entity195 and @entity196 ? how can the @entity5 reinforce its alliance with the @entity195 without provoking @entity9 or the region ? should the @entity5 insist on a binding code of naval conduct for the region ? would ratifying the @entity201 help ? how should the @entity5 work with the @entity202 , as well as larger forums such as the more inclusive regional discussions of the @entity205 and the @entity206 ? 7			1
how can the @entity5 best balance support for current reforms under way in @entity210 / @entity210 with lingering concerns about the role of the military and ethnic conflicts ? should the @entity5 suspend sanctions as @entity217 prime minister @entity216 has recommended for the @entity218 ? can the @entity5 make current reforms irreversible ? how can the @entity5 continue to maintain pressure on the government to follow through with , for example , democratic national elections in 2015 ? 8			2
how can the @entity5 generally encourage allies and partners in the region to shoulder greater responsibility and expand security cooperation ? for example , how can the @entity5 work with others on energy and resource security for the countries of the region ? what else might be done to shore up existing @entity5 alliances , including with @entity47 , @entity46 , @entity236 , the @entity195 and @entity237 ? what other security partnerships , including with @entity239 , @entity41 , @entity48 , @entity240 and @entity196 , deserve greater attention ? should the @entity5 encourage @entity41 to play a more active role in @entity243 ? how far should the @entity5 encourage allies and partners to improve multilateral security ties with one other ? 9			1
how can the @entity5 best protect an open global commons â € ” the maritime , air , cyber and outer space arteries on which both commerce and security rest ? with cyber and space threats far removed from the public eye , what should the @entity5 government do , in tandem with the private sector and allies and partners , to ensure security in all these domains ? 10			0
finally , how can the @entity5 best engage the @entity36 with respect to trade and finance , when the @entity5 economy remains fragile , debt is increasing and unemployment remains high ? is the @entity270 a realistic framework for an inclusive , " gold - standard " regional trading regimeâ € ” that is , one that would not just lower tariffs at the border but also deal with crucial issues such as protecting intellectual property rights and protecting the private sector against state - owned enterprises ? what other policies would best ensure that @entity5 leadership , presence and engagement in the region rest on a strong economic foundation ? @entity32 and @entity287 administration policies for the @entity36 would be apt to overlap more than they would differ			0
but when it comes to making hard choices and implementing policies , leaders matter			0
and here it is worth noting that president @entity32 's @entity14 team in a second term would probably lack its most able senior official : secretary of state @entity297 , who has made her preference for returning to private life abundantly clear			0
while these issues may not reveal a wide gulf in the views of the two candidates for president , they do serve to demonstrate @entity5 's growing stake in the @entity306			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity309			0

@entity309 : @entity3 security issues have barely been discussed in campaign
he says issues such as @entity7 and @entity9 's growing power need discussion
@entity318 : how can diminished @entity5 military meet *challenges* in the region ?
he asks whether @entity46 , other nations , can play a larger role
