like the spokesmen for @entity3 dictators feigning bewilderment over protesters ' demands , mainstream television news reporters finally training their attention on the growing @entity9 protest movement seem determined to cast it as the random , silly blather of an ungrateful and lazy generation of weirdos			1
they could n't be more wrong and , as time will tell , may eventually be forced to accept the inevitability of their own obsolescence			2
consider how @entity19 anchor @entity18 , covered the goings on at @entity22 downtown , where the protesters are encamped , in a segment called " seriously ? ! " " what are they protesting ? " she asked , " nobody seems to know			0
" like @entity29 testing random mall patrons on @entity31 , the main objective seemed to be to prove that the protesters did n't , for example , know that the @entity34 government has been reimbursed for the bank bailouts			1
it was condescending and reductionist			0
more predictably perhaps , a @entity38 reporter appears flummoxed in this outtake from " @entity40 , " in which the respondent refuses to explain how he wants the protests to " end			2
" transcending the shallow partisan politics of the moment , the protester explains " as far as seeing it end , i would n't like to see it end			1
i would like to see the conversation continue			0
" to be fair , the reason why some mainstream news journalists and many of the audiences they serve see the @entity9 protests as incoherent is because the press and the public are themselves			2
it is difficult to comprehend a 21st century movement from the perspective of the 20th century politics , media , and economics in which we are still steeped			1
in fact , we are witnessing @entity34 's first true internet - era movement , which -- unlike civil rights protests , labor marches , or even the @entity71 campaign -- does not take its cue from a charismatic leader , express itself in bumper - sticker - length goals and understand itself as having a particular endpoint			1
yes , there are a wide array of complaints , demands , and goals from the @entity9 protesters : the collapsing environment , labor standards , housing policy , government corruption , @entity87 lending practices , unemployment , increasing wealth disparity and so on			1
different people have been affected by different aspects of the same system -- and they believe they are symptoms of the same core problem			0
are they ready to articulate exactly what that problem is and how to address it ? no , not yet			0
but neither are @entity99 or the president who , in thrall to corporate @entity34 and @entity9 , respectively , have consistently failed to engage in anything resembling a conversation as cogent as the many i witnessed as i strolled by @entity9 's many teach - ins this morning			1
there were young people teaching one another about , among other things , how the economy works , about the disconnection of investment banking from the economy of goods and services , the history of centralized interest - bearing currency , the creation and growth of the derivatives industry , and about the @entity71 administration deciding to settle with , rather than investigate and prosecute the investment banking industry for housing fraud			2
anyone who says he has no idea what these folks are protesting is not being truthful			0
whether we agree with them or not , we all know what they are upset about , and we all know that there are investment bankers working on @entity9 getting richer while things for most of the rest of us are getting tougher			2
what upsets banking 's defenders and politicians alike is the refusal of this movement to state its terms or set its goals in the traditional language of campaigns			1
that 's because , unlike a political campaign designed to get some person in office and then close up shop ( as in the election of @entity71 ) , this is not a movement with a traditional narrative arc			1
as the product of the decentralized networked - era culture , it is less about victory than sustainability			0
it is not about one - pointedness , but inclusion and groping toward consensus			0
it is not like a book ; it is like the @entity167			0
occupy @entity9 is meant more as a way of life that spreads through contagion , creates as many questions as it answers , aims to force a reconsideration of the way the nation does business and offers hope to those of us who previously felt alone in our belief that the current economic system is broken			1
but unlike a traditional protest , which identifies the enemy and fights for a particular solution , @entity9 just sits there talking with itself , debating its own worth , recognizing its internal inconsistencies and then continuing on as if this were some sort of new normal			1
it models a new collectivism , picking up on the sustainable protest village of the movement 's @entity194 counterparts , with food , first aid , and a library			1
yes , as so many journalists seem obligated to point out , kids are criticizing corporate @entity34 while tweeting through their iphones			1
the simplistic critique is that if someone is upset about corporate excess , he is supposed to abandon all connection with any corporate product			0
of course , the more nuanced approach to such tradeoffs would be to seek balance rather than ultimatums			0
yes , there are things big corporations might do very well , like making iphones			0
there are other things big corporations may not do so well , like structure mortgage derivatives			0
might we be able to use corporations for what works , and get them out of doing what does n't ? and yes , some kids are showing up at @entity9 because it 's fun			1
they come for the people , the excitement , the camaraderie and the sense of purpose they might not be able to find elsewhere			0
but does this mean that something about @entity9 is lacking , or that it is providing something that jobs and schools are not ( thanks in part to rising unemployment and skyrocketing tuitions ) ? the members of @entity9 may be as unwieldy , paradoxical , and inconsistent as those of us living in the real world			1
but that is precisely why their new approach to protest is more applicable , sustainable and actionable than what passes for politics today			0
they are suggesting that the fiscal operating system on which we are attempting to run our economy is no longer appropriate to the task			0
they mean to show that there is an inappropriate and correctable disconnect between the abundance @entity34 produces and the scarcity its markets manufacture			2
and in the process , they are pointing the way toward something entirely different than the zero - sum game of artificial scarcity favoring top - down investors and media makers alike .			2

@entity268 says traditional media condescends to occupy @entity9 movement
he says that 's because its 21st - century , net - driven narrative does n't fit old media model
he says protest not about end - point , it 's about a new *discourse* on variety of complaints
@entity268 : protest may be unwieldy , but aims to correct disconnects in @entity34
