-- @entity2 justices are in the top 10 % of earners in this country			1
they attended the best universities and have access to the best health care , a pension plan unaffected by the economy and oh , by the way , immense power			0
there is n't a socioeconomic litmus test they could take that would result in them being in a class result other than elite			2
and yet justice @entity20 , when asked during an interview at the @entity22 in april whether he thought he would see a black president in his lifetime , made it seem as if he 's on the outside looking in			1
he said he knew " it would have to be a black president who was approved by the elites and the media , because anybody that they did n't agree with , they would take apart			1
" @entity20 saying " the elites " in that context is like @entity35 complaining about " the trash on tv			1
" people are asked to rise when he goes into the office , and he frames himself as some sort of powerless commoner ? he was appointed by president @entity44 and confirmed by the @entity45 , two symbols of @entity48 's elite			1
no , @entity20 is part of the elite class that , in his words , " approved " the selection of @entity53 as the first black president			1
he can make a distinction between political leanings of those within the class , but that in no way impacts his socioeconomic status			2
@entity20 ' remarks are an extension of the anti-elite rhetoric that has always been a part of the fabric of @entity48 politics but because of the proliferation of new media seems to have been amped up to a preposterous level			1
for the better part of three general elections , we have seen well - educated , well - funded , well - connected politicians bend over backwards trying not to appear to be well - educated , well - funded or well - connected			1
despite the charade , a study by the @entity74 found that the average net worth of last year 's incoming freshman in @entity78 was more than $ 1 million			1
the average @entity48 household ? less than $ 67,000			1
everyone wants to be seen as a @entity81 , but no one wants to admit @entity83 do n't get to be president			0
in fact , if you look at our history , in some ways , that point could n't be more @entity48			1
president @entity93 , who is sometimes called " @entity93 , " came from wealth and attended what is now known as @entity96			0
@entity97 , the author of the @entity98 , attended the @entity99 , rode horses for fun and played the violin			0
@entity103 , another one of our @entity104 , was from a wealthy family in @entity107			0
what 's more stereotypically elite than a rich guy from @entity107 ? this country 's political dialogue would benefit greatly if we acknowledged that part of history and stopped treating the word " elite " like a hot potato			1
" @entity120 " exist in all 50 states , regardless of whether they 're red or blue			0
" @entity120 " exists in all effective lobbying groups ; that 's why they 're effective			0
and " elites " exist in national media , regardless of the call letters			2
@entity127 has comfortably been on top of the ratings food chain for a number of years now , and yet it continues to brand itself as an outsider , as if it 's a weekly alternative newspaper and not a significant part of mainstream media			1
at one point , @entity135 was making as much as $ 100,000 per speaking engagement and still tried to paint herself as disenfranchised			0
last year , @entity138 famously misrepresented president @entity53 's education policy and deemed him a snob for pushing higher education -- while failing to mention his three degrees			2
but the reason why elites play this branding shell game is because people on both sides of the aisle fall for it			0
president @entity53 plays golf with @entity151			0
@entity152 pays @entity153 $ 1 million to sing at his wedding			0
and if you listen to them closely , it 's the other guy who 's elite			2
" i think the president is an elitist , and he thinks he knows what 's best for everyone , " @entity160 , a pastor from @entity161 , @entity162 , told the @entity163 after a @entity138 event in february 2012			2
" in @entity162 , we have a large blue - collar population , and what sen. @entity138 said is right			0
not everybody can go to college			0
" @entity160 is right ; everybody ca n't go to college			0
but what kind of @entity177 mind trick has been used on the country when that very idea is offensive ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			2

@entity20 said black president had to be approved by " elites and the media "
@entity182 says it 's part of *longstanding* effort by politicians to deny their own elite status
he says @entity20 is clearly in the elite *due* to his role as @entity2 justice
politicians should be *honest* about gap between their lives , average @entity48 ' , he says
