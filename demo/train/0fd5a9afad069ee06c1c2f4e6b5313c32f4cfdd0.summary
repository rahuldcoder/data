-- september 1 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity5 @entity4 @entity6 @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity14 , @entity15 : welcome to our show			2
why is @entity18 testing a rocket that might never get off the ground ? we 're launching into the details in today 's edition of @entity0			1
first up : @entity27 @entity28 : first up , @entity27			2
a viewer sent in the video you see over my shoulder here of @entity27			2
yesterday , it was a category four hurricane with maximum winds around 135 miles per hour			2
this is a powerful storm			2
it 's in the @entity40 and expected to turn towards the @entity5 east coast tomorrow			1
officials say @entity27 probably wo n't make landfall ; that 's when the center of the hurricane actually reaches shore			1
but the storm is so big that @entity49 , the @entity49 , says people along the coast may need to evacuate			2
on monday , rain and wind from @entity27 knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of people in @entity56 and the @entity57			2
this @entity58 you 're looking at shows some of the flooding in @entity56			2
is this legit ? @entity61 , @entity15 : is this legit ? a kilometer is longer than a mile			2
not at all ! it 's the other way around			1
a kilometer is about six - tenths of a mile			2
@entity6 aid @entity28 : a lot of people in @entity6 are traveling more than a dozen kilometers to try and get away from dangerous flooding			1
if you 've been watching our show , you 've seen our reports about these floods			2
they 've killed more than 1,600 people in @entity6 and affected at least 17 million other people there			1
aid is coming in from countries around the globe and from private companies : money , food , medical supplies			2
the @entity5 is sending more helicopters to @entity6 to help distribute that aid top people who need it			1
dr. @entity90 , @entity0 medical correspondent , is in @entity6			1
he gives us a look at the journey that some families there are going through and the struggles that they 're facing			1
( begin video ) @entity90 , @entity98 : most people actually are leaving like this : by foot , in the hot sun , walking for kilometers with no real idea of where exactly they 're going or what they 're going to find there			1
it is easy to see why they 're leaving			2
we are literally surrounded by water , and they 're worried that that water is just going to get higher and higher			2
so , they 're fleeing the floods with the thing , the priority that they value the most , their livestock , and just starting to walk			2
this is where so many of them ended up			2
they were just walking for kilometers and kilometers down that hot road , looking for high land , anything that could protect them from the flood waters			1
and look at what their lives are like now			2
thousands of people , literally , they have this little barrier here			2
it is so hot outside , anything to try to keep themselves cool			2
there 's no question that relief is slow coming here , but even as we 're filming today at the camp , this @entity6 army helicopter comes over and drops parcels of food			1
but this is just one camp			0
there are thousands of camps like this			0
there are more than 20 million people displaced			0
a fifth of this country is under water			0
( @entity156 ) trapped @entity157 @entity28 : terrible conditions there			0
now over in the @entity162 country of @entity7 , efforts are underway to rescue 33 miners who are trapped more than 2,300 feet underground			0
they 've been down there since a cave - in back in early august			0
all 33 people who are trapped survived and officials think it could take several months before they get out			0
the plan right now is to drill down through all that rock to reach the miners			0
what they 're making at this time is called an excavation hole			0
that 's where the drill bit will go			1
reports are that the miners are doing all right			0
they 're living off of supplies that are being sent down through bore holes			0
now those things are only about 4 inches in diameter			0
a team from @entity18 is helping out with ideas on how to keep the miners healthy			1
@entity189 [ sounds of @entity191 ] @entity192 @entity28 : behold : the @entity192 rocket			1
the thing kicks out 22 million horsepower			0
it could launch humans to the @entity198 , to @entity199			0
it 's a huge part of @entity18 's @entity201			1
just one problem : a lot of people do n't want it , including some officials at @entity18			1
the @entity206 canceled the @entity201			0
a panel declared that the @entity192 rocket is too expensive and behind schedule			1
so , the big question			0
why run the test ? some members of @entity212 still want it			0
and since the money for @entity192 is still in the federal budget , at least for the moment , the company that makes the rocket is required to keep developing it , even if it never gets off the ground			1
this day in history september 1 , 1897 -- the first @entity5 subway line begins service in @entity224 september 1 , 1939 -- @entity225 invades @entity226 , launching the start of @entity228 september 1 , 1985 -- the wreck of the @entity230 is found on the ocean floor fix our schools @entity28 : well , i know you guys get assignments every day			0
i had a little homework last thursday after we wrapped up @entity0			0
it was to interview 11 high school students from around the @entity241 , some of the state 's brightest for fix our schools			1
this is a special project that 's running all over @entity0 all week long			1
it takes ideas from teachers , administrators and , yes , students to look at how schools can succeed even while they 're facing challenges			1
and you 've probably seen some of those challenges at your school			0
now that homework assignment that i had - that group of high school juniors and seniors that i sat down to speak to - yesterday we brought you what they had to say about what makes schools good			1
today , we 're focusing on teachers			1
( begin video ) @entity28 : teachers , should they be your friends on @entity270 ? female student : no. @entity28 : anybody think so ? go ahead			0
@entity273 , @entity274 : ok			0
so , my teacher has her own @entity270 page , and all of my friends add her , all my classmates			1
and it 's so convenient because we ask her a question on what homework we had that night and she automatically replies			1
@entity28 : any of you think teachers should not be your friend on @entity270 ? want to say why ? @entity288 , @entity289 : i still really think a teacher is a teacher and students are just also there to learn			1
@entity28 : what qualities does a good teacher have ? think of your best teacher			1
tell me what he or she is like			0
@entity302 , @entity301 : she had a way of adding humor to the class			0
but then when we were studying , she would be serious about it			0
and we had a level of respect for her because she added that comedic level to the classroom			0
@entity28 : sort of a human factor ? @entity302 : yes			0
@entity315 , @entity316 : if it were n't for the dedication , the passion that my teachers have , we would all probably be all failing in those classes			0
but it 's the fact that they 're willing to stay after school , to be there before school , to walk around during lunch and come say , " oh , you 're working on the homework ? how are you doing ? " @entity28 : so , i 'm hearing passion , dedication and humor			1
let 's say your administration asks you to sit in on a hiring session			1
what qualities are you going to be looking for if you could make that decision to hire a teacher ? @entity340 , @entity341 : i would say someone that always prepares you for the next step			1
@entity345 , @entity346 : i would definitely ask them to talk about the subject , maybe talk about their favorite ways to teach			0
beause my teacher , he does n't teach the same way every day			1
he finds different ways to communicate the information			0
it really sticks once you laugh about it and you share experiences with your classmates			0
@entity28 : you are n't afraid of a challenging teacher as long as you 're learning something			1
does anybody not like a hard teacher ? @entity365 , @entity366 : it depends on what you mean by " hard teacher , " because there are teachers that be more hard than they should be			1
so , it 's a difference between being hard and overly aggressive			1
@entity28 : what do teachers do that make you shy away from learning ? @entity378 , @entity379 : when you spend too much time on one subject and you ca n't complete the entire course , it makes me shy away from trying to study myself , because i think we 're going to spend that much time , the rest of the time , on each subject , that long			0
@entity388 : something that shies me away from learning is when i know what 's going to happen in the classroom			1
for instance , i had a math teacher that , every day , we would walk in and we knew what we were going to do			1
we were going to check homework , take notes , start on homework			0
so , i think adding creativity to the teaching really helps keep our attention in the front of the classroom			0
( @entity156 ) before we go @entity28 : before we go today is something we 've been laughing about at workall day long			1
looks like man 's best friend is man 's best dance partner			1
that dog is burning up the dance floor , and this @entity414 video is burning up the internet			0
you might think we 're just showing this just because it 's awesome video , and you 're right			1
but it also fits in with one of the main goals of @entity0			0
goodbye @entity28 : making sure our show has plenty of balance			0
time to clear the dance floor for now			0
@entity0 , i 'm @entity25			0
we return tomorrow fired up and ready to go			0
looking forward to seeing you then .			0
