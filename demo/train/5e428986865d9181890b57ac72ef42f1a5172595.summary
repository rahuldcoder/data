-- @entity1 is bracing itself for a deluge of sporting egos as the best athletes in the world descend on the @entity7 capital for the @entity8			0
but an hour away , in the sleepy town of @entity10 , @entity11 , the biggest diva of all has already landed			0
when the best sprinter in the world rolls into town , you would expect a hefty entourage to follow			0
but even @entity18 does n't come with an official traveling party of 150			0
however , @entity21 's @entity8 champion is not @entity22			2
@entity22 is the epitome of a modern sporting superstar : athletic , invincible , marketable			2
the only thing out of the ordinary about this athlete is that she is a horse			0
the world 's most popular racehorse has arrived in @entity31 to compete at this month 's @entity32 -- arguably the world 's most recognizable race meeting and avidly watched by the @entity35			1
the queen of the turf made the long journey off the back of an undefeated career of 21 wins in 21 starts in her native @entity43			1
she has inspired a fanatical following in the sports - mad country , where she has her own @entity49 account , @entity51 page , blog and shop , where fans can purchase such necessities as @entity22 's own - brand shampoo ( how do you keep your tail so shiny ? ) as such , the horse has been accorded vip status for her first trip away from her home country ; most " air stables " ( the adapted cargo pallets which routinely transport racehorses around the world ) accommodate three animals			1
sometimes , just two horses travel together , a sort of equine business class			0
one horse per stall is considered first class			0
@entity22 made the 30 - hour journey solo , the only horse on the plane			2
royal approval : will unbeatable @entity22 grace @entity32 ? boarding the jet in her now - famous body suit ( inspired by the compression suits used by human athletes such as @entity43 hurdler @entity84 ) , @entity22 -- who is affectionately known as " @entity85 " -- was accompanied on the flight by her personal track rider and veterinary surgeon to make sure she remained relaxed during transit			1
the overseas tour has inevitably drawn comparisons with @entity94 , the legendary @entity95 - born stayer who became one of the earliest stars of the television age when he traveled to the @entity99 to seek his fortune after dominating @entity43 racing in the early 1930s			1
but even @entity94 never commanded the frenzied attention that accompanies @entity22 's every move			1
when she took her first tentative steps off the @entity106 747 at @entity107 last week she was probably only dimly aware that she had flown into the biggest media circus the racing world has seen since the days when the @entity111 - trained @entity110 drew crowds of reporters from both sides of the @entity115 when embarking on his three - year - old campaign in @entity117 in 1992			0
@entity22 can not be said to be unaccustomed to the attention ; thousands of fans flock to see the wonder mare every time she races , many dressed in her signature salmon and black silks ( the distinctive black dots represent the " caviar " in her name )			1
it 's a scene that is likely to be repeated when she makes her @entity31 debut in the @entity133 at @entity32 on june 23 , when a record crowd of 80,000 people is expected to pack the @entity35 's racecourse			1
a sizable @entity43 contingent will be out in force , but for once it wo n't be the ubiquitous gold and green colors that accompany @entity43 athletes of every stripe as they exert their sporting dominance around the world , but salmon and black			2
get ready , @entity32 -- the queen of racing is coming to you .			0

@entity22 arrives in @entity31 to compete in @entity32 next week
set to make @entity31 debut run in @entity133 on june 23
@entity43 mare has undefeated career statistics of 21 wins from 21 starts
overseas trip has drawn comparisons with @entity94
