could clues that police found in a hideaway outside @entity4 lead investigators to the lone remaining suspect in last week 's terror attacks ? investigators discovered @entity12 flags , automatic weapons , detonators and cash in an apartment , @entity10 's @entity9 reported sunday , citing authorities			1
they say the apartment had been rented by @entity18 , who was killed during a police rescue operation to end his siege at a kosher grocery store in @entity4 , where authorities say he killed four hostages on friday			1
but police say his partner -- and alleged co-conspirator -- @entity29 -- is still on the run			0
the last place authorities spotted her was somewhere near @entity33 's border with @entity34			2
and forensics teams have been examining the apartment in the @entity4 suburb of @entity38 to determine whether @entity29 , 26 , might have stayed there before her escape , @entity9 reported			1
@entity18 had rented the apartment from january 4 to january 11 , police said , according to @entity9			0
police began looking into the apartment after the thursday slaying of a policewoman in the @entity4 district of @entity47 , the station reported			1
@entity18 was also behind that attack , authorities say			0
and the car in which he allegedly fled the crime scene was ditched in @entity53 , near the hideout , @entity9 said			2
after abandoning the car , @entity18 boarded a train , police told @entity9			0
the details about the hideout came as millions gathered at a massive rally sunday in @entity10 , where world leaders , dignitaries and everyday citizens alike joined " unity rallies " in defiance of the terror rampage			1
up to 3.7 million people marched throughout @entity10 sunday , the spokesman for the country 's mission to the @entity71 said , describing it as the largest mobilization in his nation 's history			1
beyond @entity10 's borders , demonstrators showed their support with rallies around the world			1
at the @entity83 in @entity84 , @entity85 , audience members gave the president of the @entity87 a standing ovation when he referenced the attacks , vowing to stand against " anyone who would repress free speech anywhere from @entity92 to @entity4			1
" as he received a lifetime achievement award , actor @entity93 described sunday 's demonstrations and their rallying cry			1
" today was an extraordinary day , " he said			2
" there were millions of people that marched -- not just in @entity4 , but around the world			1
and they were @entity102 and @entity103 and @entity104			0
they were leaders of countries all over the world			0
and they did n't march in protest			2
they marched in support of the idea that we will not walk in fear			0
we wo n't do it			0
" in @entity4 , police said no incidents had been reported despite the record number of people involved in the march there			1
@entity10 remained on high alert as authorities pieced together who was behind last week 's attacks -- and warned of the threat of more violence			1
@entity10 law enforcement officers have been told to erase their social media presence and carry weapons at all times because terror sleeper cells have been activated in the country , a police source said			1
the source told @entity0 that the cells were activated in the past 24 hours			0
and it 's not just @entity10 police that are concerned			1
officials in the @entity139 and other law enforcement personnel across the @entity141 responded to a threat from @entity12 after someone re-released a september 2014 message that tells followers to " rise up and kill intelligence officers , police officers , soldiers , and civilians , " specifically naming the @entity141 , @entity10 , @entity146 and @entity147 as targets			1
according to an @entity139 memo obtained by @entity0 , department employees were told to " remain alert and consider tactics at all times while on patrol , " especially in light of the attacks in @entity10 last week			1
the @entity160 and @entity161 issued a similar bulletin to law enforcement across the @entity141			0
meanwhile , @entity10 investigators continued efforts to delve into the attackers ' backgrounds and track down @entity29 , the lone remaining suspect wanted in the terrorism rampage that left 17 people dead in three days last week			1
the clues from his apparent hideaway are n't the only information authorities have about @entity18			0
a video circulating on jihadist websites shows him pledging allegiance to @entity12 leader @entity178			1
weapons including a rifle serve as a backdrop for the video , and an @entity12 flag is prominently displayed during portions of the video			1
@entity18 identifies himself as " @entity186 " and a " soldier of the @entity188 , " while warning the @entity189 , " you attack the @entity191 , you attack @entity12 , we attack you			1
you ca n't attack and not get back anything in return			0
â€‹ " it 's unclear when all the video was shot			2
" the @entity141 intelligence community is aware of the video and is reviewing it to determine its authenticity , " said @entity198 , spokesman for the @entity141 director of national intelligence , @entity199			0
according to a source , @entity18 made several phone calls about targeting police officers in @entity10			1
long before they stormed into the offices of the @entity209 satirical magazine last week and killed 12 people , @entity10 authorities were watching @entity211 and @entity212			1
but despite red flags , authorities lost interest in them , @entity214 magazine reported			2
tipped off by @entity141 intelligence agencies that said @entity212 may have traveled to @entity219 , @entity10 placed him under surveillance in november 2011 but terminated the scrutiny last year when it deemed him no longer dangerous , according to @entity214 national security reporter @entity224 , who said he talked to multiple @entity10 officials			2
the surveillance of his brother @entity227 terminated at the end of 2013 when his phone calls suggested he had disengaged from violent extremism and was focused on counterfeiting clothing and shoes			0
@entity141 attorney general @entity239 , responding to a reported claim of responsibility by @entity237 in the @entity209 attack , told @entity0 there was no " credible information " on who sponsored the violence			0
and @entity141 officials sunday said @entity141 authorities do n't have evidence yet directly linking @entity237 ( @entity237 ) to ordering the attack			0
but they 're assuming that @entity249 met @entity141 terrorist cleric @entity250 at some point in @entity219 and received orders from @entity237 to carry out an attack , a @entity141 official told @entity0			2
the official said @entity212 's motivation for waiting so long to launch the attack was not clear			2
the @entity212 brothers were killed friday in a shootout with @entity10 security forces outside of @entity4			1
and investigators are still trying to track down their ties that may have helped them before last week 's rampage			2
on sunday , a spokeswoman for @entity263 in @entity4 said @entity264 , a well - known spiritual leader believed to have radicalized @entity212 , had been working as a nurse trainee at the hospital until last friday			2
meanwhile , an incendiary device was hurled at a @entity269 newspaper that reprinted the @entity209 cartoons			0
no one was in the building at the time of the attack early sunday			0
the arson attack at the @entity276 occurred about 2 a.m. , the newspaper said on its website			0
the device was thrown into the archive section of the building , setting it on fire			0
it 's unclear whether the arson attack is connected to the @entity209 attack			2
the @entity269 paper reprinted @entity209 cartoons depicting the @entity287 after the attack on the satirical magazine 's offices in @entity4			1
the @entity292 hacking collective has vowed to retaliate for the @entity209 attack			0
" we intend to take revenge in their name , we are going to survey your activities on the net , we are going to shut down your accounts on all social networks , " a video from the group said friday			0
in online forums sunday , they said they claimed to have blocked at least one jihadist website			0
