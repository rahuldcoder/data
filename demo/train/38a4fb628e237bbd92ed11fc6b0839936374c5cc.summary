-- one endless june afternoon a decade ago , i drove along southern @entity3 's @entity2 , past the weak spot in the planetary crust whose rupture recently brought air traffic in @entity9 to an ashen standstill			1
it was summer solstice , a day when the sun lolled at the horizon but never set , turning to crimson the basalt cliffs that face the @entity16			0
from countless crags along their length gushed great arcs of water , pressured from above by a weight draped over a hundred square kilometers like a huge slab of white cake frosting : the 200 - meter - thick @entity25 glacier			1
between the coastal cliffs and the ice lay a band of green slopes , five kilometers wide , interspersed with fjords and valleys that held clusters of farmhouses and barns with red metal roofs , their shining silos and occasional church steeples pointed toward the immense glacier hovering overhead			2
the air , brilliantly clear , resounded with terns , orange - billed oystercatchers , petrels , whimbrels and musical wagtails			2
at 8 in the evening , farmers in overalls were still out haying , their pale hair aflame in the suspended daylight			0
i saw a string of 10 riders on buckskin and dun mounts , forelegs lifted in the extra-high gait unique to @entity3 horses , making them appear to be swimming through the deep green ribbon at the glacier 's edge			1
that extended , gilded moment was as perfect a definition of beauty on @entity64 as i have known			0
it remains indelible , even though over the past week , much of what i saw was swept away as @entity25 's erupting volcano melted a gaping hole in its ice cap , flooding what lay below			2
a big clue as to why that happened can be found an hour 's drive to the west , halfway between @entity25 and @entity3 's capital , @entity76 , in a broad valley with a sharp cleft down its middle			1
that place , @entity81 , is so famous in @entity3 history that practically no signs announce it , because everyone knows what and where it is			1
in a.d. 930 , more than a thousand years after the decline of ancient @entity90 , @entity81 was where @entity92 democracy was reborn			2
by coincidence -- or maybe not -- the spot where the @entity96 settlers who made up the island 's infant society chose to convene their first parliament is one of the few places on the @entity64 's surface where the geologic action that defines our planet 's land and seas is visible			0
here , astride the @entity110 , the @entity108 and @entity109 plates pull away from each other			1
perhaps 20 million years ago , this wrenching forced an upwelling of hot rock to rise through the ocean , and @entity3 was formed			1
@entity81 's rift valley floor is scored with cracks and fissures ; at one point , a lava escarpment that is the eastern edge of @entity108 towers 30 meters higher than the western edge of @entity9			1
the continents are currently recoiling from each other at a clip of two centimeters per year , a process that daily releases clouds of geothermic steam and sends geysers skyward -- and , sometimes , molten magma and volcanic ash			1
of course , the farmers who gathered in this shattered young landscape more than a millennium ago to lay down terms for civilization had no inkling that to the west lay an entire @entity138 , where their democratic example would one day be magnified until it forged the philosophical basis for the most powerful country the planet has ever seen			2
both @entity3 and the @entity143 exalt democracy as a social achievement worthy of lasting an eternity			1
yet the latter 's unprecedented strength has derived not just from enlightened government , but from the release of its own hot clouds : exhaust from its vast industries , fleets and mechanized agriculture			0
as we have learned , these gases form an invisible barrier that , like a greenhouse 's glass ceiling , keeps reflected heat of the sun from escaping our atmosphere			0
the denser that gaseous barrier grows , the hotter things get and the faster glaciers melt			0
as they flow off the land , we are warned , seas rise			0
yet something else is lately worrying geologists : the likelihood that the @entity64 's crust , relieved of so much formidable weight of ice borne for many thousands of years , has begun to stretch and rebound			0
as it does , a volcano awakens in @entity3 ( with another , larger and adjacent to still - erupting @entity25 , threatening to detonate next )			1
the @entity64 shudders in @entity178			0
and those are just the big ones , 6 + on the @entity186 , and just in 2010			0
and it 's only april			0
it 's looking like this may be a long decade			0
and if we do n't pull carbon out of the way we energize our lives soon , a small clump of our not - too - distant surviving descendants may find themselves , as @entity197 scientist @entity196 has direly predicted , like the first @entity3 : gathered on some near - barren hunk of rock near one of the still - habitable poles , trying yet anew to eke out a plan for human civilization			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			2

@entity3 has great volcanic activity , is where @entity9 and @entity108 continents meet
@entity206 : scientists fear melting of ice sheets will lead to more volcanoes , *earthquakes*
@entity3 and @entity143 *revere* democracy and want to see it endure , he says
he says civilization threatened by *economies* that depend on *emitting* global - *warming* gases
