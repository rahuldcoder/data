" the @entity11 want to offer a world without nuclear arms , " he said , adding that the @entity9 wants to substitute conventional arms instead			1

" asked about the possibility of a war against @entity42 , @entity3 grabbed a sheaf of newspapers from a pile and read aloud headlines warning of dire regional and global consequences			1
as he sat beside @entity1 foreign minister @entity48 , @entity3 took questions from the dozens of people who had crowded into a room at @entity1 's @entity52 in @entity0 and answered them in the long - winded fashion that is familiar to any @entity1 who remember his talks from before an illness sidelined him in 2006			2

the group is among 52 political prisoners expected to be released in coming months , in what would be the largest @entity1 prisoner release in more than a decade			0
