-- will the @entity2 " @entity1 " ? if an internet petition has its way , yes			1
" @entity5 , the king of the song parody , has been nominated to perform at the next @entity2 halftime show on a @entity9 petition -- and close to 60,000 people have signed on their approval as of thursday morning			1
@entity12 , who created the petition , told @entity13 that he was inspired by a suggestion that @entity16 headline the extravaganza , which has featured such names as @entity19 , the @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 ( and , to be fair , @entity23 and @entity24 )			0
" i thought , ' man , this is so crappy , ' " he told the publication			0
the time is certainly right for @entity5 , who is riding perhaps the biggest wave of his career			1
his new album , " @entity32 , " debuted at no. 1 , and the series of eight videos he made to promote it -- including parodies of " @entity38 " ( " foil " ) , " @entity40 " ( " @entity41 " ) and " @entity42 " ( " tacky " ) -- quickly became some of the most - viewed on @entity45			0
" @entity5 's " best song ever ? in the petition , @entity12 observes that some of the artists parodied could join @entity5 on stage , and the result would be most entertaining			1
" the theatrics alone would be hilarious and a welcoming change , and draw a wider audience of fans that typically would not tune into the championship game or half - time show , " he writes			0
next year 's @entity2 -- that would be @entity59 , for the roman numeral - inclined -- will be held february 1 in @entity61 , @entity62			2
@entity12 told @entity13 that @entity5 would be by far the best choice the @entity64 could make			2
" in all honesty , would you rather have @entity16 or @entity67 perform the @entity2 or something different ? " he said			2
the man has a point .			0
