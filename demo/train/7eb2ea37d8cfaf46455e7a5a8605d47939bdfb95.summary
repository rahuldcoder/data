-- @entity3 president @entity2 's sister lost her bid for a seat in the nation 's parliamentary elections , a result seen as a blow to the controversial leader and , according to one analyst , a " possible sign of fraud			1
" @entity21 , running in her family 's hometown of @entity20 , was defeated by a conservative rival in friday 's elections for the @entity24 , @entity3 's parliament , the country 's news outlets said saturday			1
more than 64 percent of eligible voters streamed to the polls in large numbers , and election officials praised the exercise , in which about 3,400 candidates vied for @entity24 seats			2
it 's first time @entity3 are voting since allegations of rigging in the 2009 elections triggered mass street protests against president @entity2 's re-election			1
many observers say the underlying issue of the election is whether voters back the president , who has been in a rivalry with @entity3 supreme leader ayatollah @entity45			1
@entity45 publicly supported @entity2 's controversial re-election victory during the dispute over the 2009 ballot results			1
but tensions have flared between the two leaders over the past year , with @entity2 disappearing from public view for 11 days after the supreme leader overruled his decision to fire an intelligence minister			0
several of @entity2 's top political allies have also been subjected to lawsuits and investigations			1

the current @entity24 speaker , @entity65 , and @entity66 , the current chairman of the @entity69 and @entity68 , were re-elected , state media said			1
conservatives backing @entity45 or with links to him performed well in the race			1
one candidate , @entity73 , was overwhelmingly leading his race			2
his daughter is married to @entity45 's son			2
but one observer suggested the defeat of the president 's sister could be a sign of political fraud			1
" in @entity3 , locals are usually fiercely loyal to high ranking representatives from their area , even if they are unpopular at national level , " said @entity83 , an @entity85 - @entity3 @entity84 analyst			0
" although @entity2 is not a popular politician , the very fact that his sister was defeated in @entity20 is a valid possible sign of fraud			1
this is likely to lead to even more infighting			0
" @entity97 , the deputy interior minister overseeing the elections , praised the polling			0
" these have been the most lawful elections , " he said			0
" the elections were conducted in the best possible way			0
" @entity104 said it was the first time @entity3 successfully used computerized voting systems in some polling stations			0
final results might be released in a matter of days			0
he said flooding delayed the retrieval of ballot boxes from remote communities			0

there were no candidates from the @entity119 in this year 's parliamentary election			2
@entity3 political analysts describe the vote as a contest between rival conservative factions within the government			2
