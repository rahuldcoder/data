-- @entity1 has been getting a kicking off the pitch in recent weeks -- now it 's trying to resolve a turf war			1
world football 's governing body is set to hold talks with team representatives over plans to hold the @entity9 on artificial turf			1
earlier this year a number of players -- including @entity17 star @entity16 , world player of the year @entity11 and @entity13 's all - time leading scorer @entity12 launched a court case against the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) and @entity1 with the @entity21 tribunal over the decision not to hold the tournament on grass pitches			1
the group claims that the @entity19 and @entity1 are guilty of sexual discrimination -- a charge both organizations have flatly rejected			2
players are also concerned artificial turf leads to a higher risk of injury and greater wear and tear on their bodies			1
now @entity37 , the secretary general of @entity1 , is set to speak with players and coaches at the @entity9 draw on december 6 in @entity40 about the matter			1
a @entity1 spokesman told @entity0 : " what we can confirm is that the @entity1 general secretary will meet with all the team representatives present during his stay on the occasion of the @entity49 in @entity40			2
" @entity51 lawyer @entity50 , who is representing the players , wrote to the general secretary last week outlining the position of his clients			0
" the players and their representatives are prepared to discuss their proposal for funding and installing the highest quality temporary grass fields , much like the ones used in prior @entity64 , " said @entity50 in a letter sent to @entity37 last week			2
" we can also talk about the use of goal - line technology			0
since men 's @entity64 now feature goal - line technology -- which @entity1 describes as " crucial ... in supporting the match officials " -- so too should the women 's tournament			1
" regardless of whether @entity1 's prior unwillingness to speak with the players resulted from its financial ties to the artificial turf industry or some other factor , we appreciate you now offering ' open channels of communication ' and ' open dialogue ' with the players			1
" we hope you will keep your word by speaking with the players on or about december 6 so that together we can resolve the dispute and have a @entity9 worthy of the amazing athletes who are the key to its success			0
" @entity50 told @entity0 on monday that he was " pleased " @entity37 would " keep his word and begin an ' open dialogue with the players regarding competition conditions at the @entity93			1
" as he should know , a number of the leading women 's players will be in @entity17 on december 6th preparing for a tournament , " @entity50 added			2
" others are participating for club teams around the world			0
the players will provide times when they are available to speak with mr. @entity37 by phone around the date of the official draw			0
we are hopeful that the @entity19 and broadcasters such as @entity108 will join the discussion			0
" independent consultant professor @entity110 , who traveled to @entity111 earlier this year to inspect the stadiums and training pitches for the @entity9 , believes the harsh weather conditions in northern latitudes make " preparing natural turf particularly challenging			1
" " the majority of stadiums in @entity111 have accepted that only football turf is a credible surface to meet the demands of the weather and usage , " @entity110 told @entity1 's website			1
@entity110 also argues trying to lay natural turf on top of artificial pitches could prove difficult -- and potentially dangerous for the players			2
" for the natural turf to be successful , the roots have to penetrate to form a stable surface , " added @entity110			0
" where this has been attempted , the roots have not penetrated and the natural turf surface begins to slide on top of the artificial turf surface			1
" @entity137 , who scored 158 goals for @entity13 and won the 1999 @entity9 , told @entity0 that she believes the tournament should be played on grass			2
" i 've played on both and i prefer grass , " she said			0
" i do n't think by any means this is the @entity111 looking to discriminate in any way			0
" i understand why a lot of their fields are artificial surfaces based on the amount of play and the weather			0
" these are the best players in the world playing in their biggest tournament , i just think it should be played on grass			1
i 'm just hoping @entity1 does the right thing			0
" from a player that 's played on both , i prefer playing on grass			0
there are certain aspects of the game that are just truer on grass			0
" @entity50 has invited television broadcast partners as well as sponsors to the talks , while the players have also agreed to using a mediator to " facilitate discussion			0
" in an interview with his organization 's own website in october , @entity37 stressed that @entity1 remains " committed " to producing the best possible tournament			2
he said that the @entity19 proposed that the tournament be played on artificial turf and insists it is of the highest quality			1
@entity37 said : " as has already been explained , this is not a question of money , or of differences between men 's and women 's events , but it is a matter of the natural conditions in @entity111			0
" we want to guarantee consistent top - level playing conditions for all 24 teams during the event , both in the official stadiums and at the training sites			0
this has been the sole reason behind the decision to play on artificial turf from day one			1
" the tournament , which will be held in @entity111 , involves 24 nations and takes place from june 6 to july 5 .			1
