@entity0 , @entity1 -- soldier			1
investigators spent monday trying to figure out what led 40 - year - old @entity8 from repairing missiles for the @entity10 to a @entity12 temple in suburban @entity13 , where he was killed by police at the end of a sunday morning rampage			1
the shaven - headed page , whose tattoos included the @entity21 cross adopted by white supremacist groups , had been the front man for a white - power rock band called " @entity24 " for several years			1
two former neighbors identified him from photos on the band 's @entity28 page			1
his path appears to have taken him from @entity31 to @entity13 , where he enlisted in the @entity10 in 1992 ; back to @entity31 ; to @entity32 , where he started the band ; and then back to the @entity13 area , where he had been " a short time " before the shootings , @entity0 police chief @entity38 told reporters monday			1
the @entity10 trained @entity8 first as a mechanic for the @entity42 anti-aircraft missile system , then as a psychological warfare specialist			1
he rose to the rank of sergeant before losing a stripe due to " patterns of misconduct , " according to a @entity50 official who spoke on condition of anonymity			0
in october 1998 , he received a general discharge under honorable conditions , the official said			2
@entity55 attempts to cope after @entity1 shooting deaths @entity57 of @entity58 , who described @entity8 as " my closest friend " in the service more than a decade ago , said @entity8 was pushed out of the military for showing up to formation drunk			1
he described page as " a very kind , very smart individual -- loved his friends			0
one of those guys with a soft spot			0
" but even then , page " was involved with white supremacy , " @entity57 said			2
" he would talk about the racial holy war , like he wanted it to come , " @entity57 said			2
" but to me , he did n't seem like the type of person to go out and hurt people			0
" later monday , @entity57 told @entity2 's " @entity78 " that page likely sought attention to his beliefs " because he was always the loner type of person			0
even in a group of people , he would be off alone			0
" @entity86 , the special agent in charge of the @entity89 's @entity13 office , said investigators have been told @entity8 may have been involved with the white supremacist movement , but that had n't been confirmed			1
no motive for sunday 's attack had been established , but the @entity89 was investigating whether the killings at the @entity12 temple were an act of domestic terrorism , she said			0
@entity8 moved back to @entity99 after his discharge , where he had a tough time in civilian life " and was basically living on the street , " @entity57 said			1
it was during that period that @entity8 joined a " racist band " and started to get his body inked , his @entity10 buddy told @entity2			1
remembering the victims " i asked him why he was aligning himself with this stuff , " @entity57 said			0
" he really did n't answer			0
" page had a girlfriend who left him for another member of the band , which then kicked him out , @entity57 said			2
the last time they saw each other -- more than 10 years ago -- @entity57 said page was on a motorcycle trip across the country			0
it was a trip @entity8 recounted in 2010 , in an online interview about his band @entity24			1
he founded it in in the small town of @entity125 in eastern @entity32 , where he ended up after bouncing around the country from @entity127 to @entity128			1
" i am originally from @entity31 and had always been independent , but back in 2000 i set out to get involved and wanted to basically start over , " he said			1
the band put out at least two recordings through a label that promoted them on the neo-nazi website @entity134			2
in a 2010 interview posted online , @entity8 said his lyrics " vary from sociological issues , religion , and how the value of human life has been degraded by being submissive to tyranny and hypocrisy that we are subjugated to			1
" @entity144 played gigs in @entity32 and in the @entity146 , he said			1
while @entity8 shared the stage with many similar bands , he was n't a movement leader and does n't appear to have been involved in any criminal acts , said @entity151 , who tracks hate groups for the @entity153 in @entity154			1
white supremacist groups still strong nevertheless , @entity151 called page " a neo-nazi skinhead in the very thick of the white supremacist movement			1
" in a statement posted on its website monday , the band 's imprint , @entity161 56 , said it had removed " all images and products related to end @entity144			2
" " we have worked hard over the years to promote a positive image and have posted many articles encouraging people to take a positive path in life , to abstain from drugs , alcohol , and just general behavior that can affect ones life negatively , " the company said			0
" we do not wish to profit from this tragedy financially or with publicity , " it added			0
" in closing , please do not take what @entity8 did as honorable or respectable and please do not think we are all like that			1
" it was n't clear monday what brought page back to @entity1 , where he lived first with a girlfriend , then on his own			2
@entity187 , a former neighbor in a @entity13 apartment building , said page would frequently lift weights and occasionally leave home with a guitar			2
but every time he tried to talk to his neighbor , @entity187 said , he would just grunt and walk on by			0
who are @entity12 and what do they believe ? and a former landlord , @entity196 , told @entity2 that @entity8 worked nights at a welding supply business and had recently broken up with a girlfriend when he signed his lease			1
i saw no violence in him , " said @entity196 , who has been questioned by federal agents since sunday 's killings			0
" the feds asked me how he paid , whether he had weapons			0
i had no idea he had weapons , " he said			0
@entity57 said he knows @entity8 's name will now be inextricably linked with hate and bloodshed , " but that 's not how i remember him			2
" " it 's the racial holy war talk i always took as something he would vent about , and not act on it , " he said			2
" i never pictured him as someone who would do anything			0
i thought maybe he was just saying it for attention			0
" share your thoughts and remembrances for the victims on @entity225			0
