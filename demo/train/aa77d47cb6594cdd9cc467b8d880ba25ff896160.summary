on thursday , dr. @entity0 thought he was going to die			1
it was the ninth day since the @entity3 missionary worker came down sick with @entity4 in @entity5			0
his condition worsening by the minute , @entity0 called his wife to say goodbye			1
thankfully , the call was premature			0
@entity0 is back on his feet -- literally -- after receiving a last - ditch , highly experimental drug			1
another @entity3 missionary with @entity4 got the same			0
@entity0 's and @entity14 's conditions significantly improved after receiving the medication , sources say			1
@entity0 was able to walk into @entity16 in @entity17 after being evacuated to the @entity3 last week , and @entity14 is expected to arrive in @entity17 on tuesday			1
on july 22 , @entity0 woke up feeling feverish			1
fearing the worst , @entity0 immediately isolated himself			1
@entity14 's symptoms started three days later			1
a rapid field blood test confirmed the infection in both of them after they had become ill with fever , vomiting and diarrhea			0
it 's believed @entity0 and @entity14 , who worked with the aid organization @entity27 , contracted @entity4 from another health care worker at their hospital in @entity5 , although the official @entity32 case investigation has yet to be released			1
the experimental drug , known as @entity34 , was developed by the biotech firm @entity35 , which is based in @entity36			1
the patients were told that the treatment had never been tried before in a human being but had shown promise in small experiments with monkeys			2
questions about this new @entity4 drug according to company documents , four monkeys infected with @entity4 survived after being given the therapy within 24 hours after infection			1
two of four other monkeys that started therapy within 48 hours after infection also survived			2
one monkey that was not treated died within five days of exposure to the virus			0
@entity0 and @entity14 were aware of the risk of taking a new , little - understood treatment and gave informed consent , according to two sources familiar with the care of the missionary workers			1
in the monkeys , the experimental serum had been given within 48 hours of infection			2
@entity0 did n't receive it until he 'd been sick for nine days			1
the medicine is a three - mouse monoclonal antibody , meaning that mice were exposed to fragments of the ebola virus and then the antibodies generated within the mice 's blood were harvested to create the medicine			2
it works by preventing the virus from entering and infecting new cells			0
the ebola virus causes viral hemorrhagic fever , which refers to a group of viruses that affect multiple organ systems in the body and are often accompanied by bleeding			2
early symptoms include sudden onset of fever , weakness , muscle pain , headaches and a sore throat			0
they later progress to vomiting , diarrhea , impaired kidney and liver function -- and sometimes internal and external bleeding			0
the @entity34 vials , stored at subzero temperatures , reached the hospital in @entity5 where @entity0 and @entity14 were being treated thursday morning			1
doctors were instructed to allow the serum to thaw naturally without any additional heat			0
it was expected that it would be eight to 10 hours before the medicine could be given , according to a source familiar with the process			0
@entity0 asked that @entity14 be given the first dose because he was younger and he thought he had a better chance of fighting it , and she agreed			1
however , as the first vial was still thawing , @entity0 's condition took a sudden turn for the worse			2
@entity0 began to deteriorate and developed labored breathing			2
he told his doctors he thought he was dying , according to a source with firsthand knowledge of the situation			0
knowing his dose was still frozen , @entity0 asked if he could have @entity14 's now - thawed medication			1
it was brought to his room and administered through an iv. within an hour of receiving the medication , @entity0 's condition dramatically improved			2
he began breathing easier ; the rash over his trunk faded away			0
one of his doctors described the events as " miraculous			0
" by the next morning , @entity0 was able to take a shower on his own before getting on a specially designed @entity127 air ambulance jet to be evacuated to the @entity3			2
@entity14 also received a vial of the medication			2
her response was not as remarkable , according to sources familiar with the treatment			0
however , doctors on sunday administered writebol a second dose of the medication , which resulted in significant improvement			0
she was stable enough to be evacuated back to the @entity3			0
the process by which the medication was made available to @entity0 and @entity14 is highly unusual			1
@entity138 spokesman @entity137 cautioned that health authorities " can not start using untested drugs in the middle of an outbreak , for various reasons			1
" @entity144 similarly weighed in on the side of caution			0
" it is important to keep in mind that a large - scale provision of treatments and vaccines that are in very early stages of development has a series of scientific and ethical implications , " the organization said in a statement			0
" as doctors , trying an untested drug on patients is a very difficult choice since our first priority is to do no harm , and we would not be sure that the experimental treatment would do more harm than good			1
" @entity34 has not been approved for human use and has not even gone through the clinical trial process , which is standard to prove the safety and efficacy of a medication			2
it may have been given under the @entity174 's " compassionate use " regulation , which allows access to investigational drugs outside clinical trials			0
getting approval for compassionate use is often long and laborious , but in the case of @entity0 and @entity14 , they received the medication within seven to 10 days of their exposure to the ebola virus			1
on july 30 , the @entity186 , an arm of the military responsible for any chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear and high - yield explosive threats , allotted additional funding to @entity192 due to " promising results			0
" @entity3 ebola patient ' seems to be improving '			0

untested drugs ca n't be used in the midst of an outbreak , spokesman says
