-- for @entity2 , it all started with a friend playing him a @entity5 record ; for @entity6 , it was a tv commercial featuring a powerful soprano singer ; and for @entity8 , a community choir practice in his township			0
these flashes of operatic singing were all it took for the three young @entity14 to instantly fall under the spell of opera and never look back			1
@entity2 , @entity6 and @entity8 are the stars of " @entity18 : i live to @entity19 , " a compelling documentary released earlier this year spotlighting the rising wave of talented opera singers emerging from @entity14 's black townships			1
born as @entity14 was throwing off the chains of apartheid , the film 's stars came to discover the enchanting world of opera in their teens , entranced by its beautiful voices and the magnificent music			1
since then , they 've sung their way from humble beginnings to @entity14 's top stages , thrilling opera audiences in their country and beyond			1
along the way , the determined singers had to overcome everything from financial hardship and health struggles to social resistance and lack of support in order to follow their dreams			1
read this : @entity52 girl to opera diva " if you had told me a few years ago that classical @entity58 and @entity59 opera is an art form that 's gaining in popularity in black @entity14 townships , i certainly would have been surprised -- in a way that i think many of the audiences for the film are , " says @entity54 , director of the film			1
@entity67 tradition what @entity54 came to realize was that opera has become popular among some people in @entity14 's townships thanks to the widespread culture of community choirs and competitive choral singing			1
this strong musical tradition has paved the way for many talented young singers to develop an interest in classical opera , says @entity79 , managing director of the @entity80 , one of the continent 's most famous production houses			1
" the national sports in @entity14 are not soccer or rugby , but choirs , " notes @entity79			2
" the culture of choral singing in @entity14 is huge			2
it 's deep rooted in the community and has a huge repertoire , " he adds			0
" and what happens with choir singers is they reach a sort of a ceiling -- because they 're singing traditional works ... then they start moving towards opera genre and it opens up a new world for them			2
" rising stars " i live to sing , " which was first aired in july on @entity105 in @entity106 , is centered around the @entity107 -- once an all - white school and now home to remarkable singers from @entity14 's black townships , some of whom have graced international stages such as @entity115 and @entity116			1
the documentary follows @entity6 , @entity8 and @entity2 through their studies at the school as they set out to introduce themselves to the world of opera and become professional classical singers			1
throughout the film , the stars ' charisma and personality shine through			0
@entity127 , 26 at the time of filming last year , is an extremely committed and disciplined bass baritone with confidence in his talent ; @entity132 , 24 , is a shy soprano with extraordinary singing abilities ; and @entity134 , the youngest of the protagonists , is a gregarious , outspoken 20 - year - old with a powerful tenor voice			0
the filmmakers capture the singers ' preparations for a performance of " @entity141 " at @entity143 's main opera house -- a landmark building in the anti-apartheid struggle			2
read this : five @entity14 festivals you ca n't miss they also follow the students to the @entity151 , where they spend a summer as apprentices at the esteemed @entity153			1
while in @entity106 , @entity127 was invited to sing at the @entity154 to mark @entity155 on july 18			2
" i 'd never dreamed that i would be singing at the @entity156 , " says @entity127			0
" i felt delighted , " he adds , " singing there and honoring our late @entity155			0
" but along with capturing the triumphant performances and the intense training , the filmmakers also travel to the townships where the young singers grew up , often under challenging conditions			1
@entity132 hails from @entity166 , a sprawling township on the outskirts of @entity143 that has been struggling not only with high unemployment and crime rates but also health scares			0
" ( it has ) one of the highest rates of tuberculosis in the world and in fact @entity6 herself has suffered from a bout of tuberculosis , " says @entity54			0
" her parents have both passed away from health problems , so she has not had an easy life			0
" @entity127 is from @entity182 , a township in @entity183 that is also struggling with rife unemployment			0
his extraordinary talent shone from an early age , winning several youth singing competitions , and last week he traveled to the @entity151 to audition for , among others , @entity189 , the prestigious @entity106 music school			2
but at the time , his discovery of opera and his decision to pursue classical singing professionally did n't go down too well with his financially struggling family			0
" my father wanted nothing to do with it , " says @entity127 , whose parents are both unemployed			0
" the last thing our parents want for their children is for them to live as difficult as they did -- so now they all want careers that they know you 'll definitely get money for sure , and with opera it 's kind of difficult , " he adds			2
" last year was actually the first time my father actually saw me singing ... that is when he actually approved of opera music			0
