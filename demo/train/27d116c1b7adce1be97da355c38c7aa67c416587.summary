-- tech visionary @entity1 made headlines when he said recently that artificial intelligence is like " summoning the demon " and may well be humanity 's " biggest existential threat			1
" just this month , researchers in @entity8 announced they had created a software system that could outperform the average @entity8 high school student on a standardized college entrance exam			0
in other words , the machines are catching up to humans in intelligence			1
concerns about @entity17 and robots can be divided into two broad categories and framed as questions			2
first , will the machines take our jobs and destroy our livelihoods ? second , do we have to worry that advanced artificial intelligence could truly threaten humanity , perhaps by acting to destroy us ( as in the " @entity28 " movies ) or enslave us ( as in the " @entity30 " series )			1
the evidence suggests that , at least for the foreseeable future , the impact on employment is what should worry us			1
the reality is that most people in our workforce are employed in occupations that are on some level fundamentally routine and predicable			0
most people come to work and , regardless of their job title or industry , tend to face the same basic types of challenges again and again			2
just as a trainee might learn to do a job by carefully observing everything done by an experienced worker , rapidly improving machine learning algorithms seem likely to eventually figure out how to do a great many jobs			1
last year , a team in @entity54 performed a detailed analysis of over 700 occupations in the @entity57			1
they came to the conclusion that jobs constituting a staggering 47 % of @entity57 employment — well over 60 million jobs — could become automated in a decade or two			1
it 's important to realize that projections like these do not rely on the stuff of science fiction			0
machine learning technology is already in widespread use ; it powers @entity71 's language translation service as well as its self - driving cars , the book and movie recommendations made on websites like @entity76 and @entity77 , and the potential matches suggested by online dating sites			1
the idea that smart software will eventually begin to eat any job that consists primarily of tasks that are predicable requires only a fairly simple extrapolation that technology will only get better and better			2
many people remain very skeptical that progress will ever result in a significant unemployment problem			0
so far , history is on their side			0
the classic example of technological disruption is the mechanization of agriculture			0
in the @entity57 , most people once worked on farms			1
now the number is roughly 2 % of the population			2
millions of jobs were lost , and yet we are clearly better off ; food is much cheaper and workers moved on to often more fulfilling jobs in other industries			2
the farm workers of yesteryear were able to transition into a rising manufacturing sector and later into service industries			0
but it may be overly optimistic to expect that scenario to play out again in the face of today 's technology			0
unlike the specialized , mechanical innovations that transformed agriculture , today 's information technology is truly general purpose , and it will ultimately bring sophisticated artificial intelligence and robotics capability to every industry and employment sector			1
technology will certainly create new industries , but there is little reason to expect they will need many workers			0
we can get some idea of how the future is likely to look by examining one of the most successful technology companies			2
@entity71 , for example , has become enormously influential and achieved a staggering market valuation with a workforce of only about 50,000 people			0
that 's roughly half the number of jobs the @entity57 economy needs to create in a single month , just to keep pace with growth in the population			1
what about the even more frightening prospect of smart machines destroying or enslaving us ? unlike the prospect for technology to displace many workers , this outcome requires a quantum leap in technological progress			0
building a machine that can truly think like a human , conceive new ideas and exhibit self - awareness remains a daunting challenge and likely lies at least decades in the future			1
it is entirely possible that accelerating computer power coupled with advances in brain science may eventually result in a true thinking machine			0
many researchers believe that such a truly advanced @entity17 would be driven to turn its intellectual energies inward , repeatedly improving its own design and making itself even smarter			0
the result could be an " intelligence explosion " culminating in a silicon - based mind hundreds or even thousands of times more intelligent than any human being			1
and there is , of course , no guarantee that this new alien intelligence would be especially concerned about the welfare of humanity			0
the chance that we 'll see a true thinking machine anytime soon is small			2
yet , the magnitude of the disruption — and potential threat — that would result is so large that the prospect should not be ignored			0
for now , though , the pressing question is : how do we adapt our economy and society to a future in which machines do much of the work now performed by people ? will humans go the way of horses ?			1

@entity198 : concerns about artificial intelligence should be taken seriously
@entity202 : in the immediate future , the risk that you 'll lose your job to a machine is real
47 % of @entity57 employment - well over 60 million jobs - could be automated in coming decades
@entity202 : how do we adapt to an economy where humans ' jobs are displaced by machines ?
