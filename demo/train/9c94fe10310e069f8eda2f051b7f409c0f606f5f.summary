a fight has broken out between two of the most prominent members of the @entity3 : @entity5 sen. @entity4 and @entity7 sen. @entity6			1
in an op - ed for @entity9 , @entity6 took a shot at @entity4 , without actually naming him , when he wrote , " i will remind anyone who thinks we will win elections by trashing previous @entity3 nominees or holding oneself out as some paragon in the mold of @entity18 , that splintering the party is not the route to victory			1
" this was just one more flash point in the ongoing tension that has characterized their relationship			0
the back - and - forth has captured considerable attention since both men have been discussed as possible contenders for the @entity3 nomination in 2016			1
each is seen as representing a different faction of the @entity3 right : cruz the take - no - prisoners , slash - and - burn conservatives who will do just about anything to obtain their objectives and @entity6 the libertarian voice pushing back against all forms of government			1
if @entity4 and @entity6 turn out to be the major spokespersons for the debate about where the @entity3 should go , then the party is going to be in some big trouble			1
@entity4 represents an extremist wing of the @entity3 that ca n't seem to govern			1
since the emergence of the tea party in 2009 , the @entity3 has been shaped by a group of politicians who have been willing to employ extraordinarily aggressive tactics in the pursuit of cuts to domestic spending			1
nobody has symbolized this style of leadership more than @entity4			2
he led the drumbeat to shut down the federal government to force president @entity61 's hand on spending and has favored the @entity3 refusal to raise the debt ceiling			2
@entity4 has also been a master of the filibuster , employing variations of the tactic to bring the @entity68 to a standstill			0
this image of obstructionist governance might excite the most loyal activists in the party , but it is not a style conducive to presidential leadership and it is not a style that plays well at a national level			0
@entity3 have suffered greatly in the polls as a result of these kinds of extremist tactics			0
one recent poll found that four out of five @entity85 do n't trust the @entity3			2
" that 's just about as bad as it gets , " noted @entity87 host , and @entity3 , @entity88			2
many @entity85 question whether the @entity3 can govern			0
a @entity4 candidacy would perfectly set up a @entity93 candidacy by allowing @entity94 to emphasize her ability to get things done and make the political system work			0
@entity6 represents a different problem : he is a politician whose rhetoric is totally at odds with the history of the @entity3			1
since the 1930s , libertarians have had trouble gaining traction within the party			0
the reality has been that most republicans have embraced the federal government as a permanent part of national politics			0
in the area of national security , the party has been a driving force behind the expansion of the military establishment since the @entity119			0
while some republicans like @entity6 might now rail against the surveillance tactics of the @entity125 , the recent power of this agency was built on the foundation that @entity3 built with the war on terrorism under president @entity129			1
neither have @entity3 been a true small government party in domestic policy			2
studies have shown how federal spending has grown more dramatically under @entity3 presidents , including @entity18 , than @entity94			0
most republicans have avoided cutting most of the big - ticket programs , such as @entity138 or farm assistance , while pushing for an expansion of government in other areas , such as @entity143			0
@entity3 legislators have been as skillful at pork - barrel politics as anyone from the other side of the aisle			0
though @entity6 may claim he will do things differently , @entity94 could have a field day challenging the veracity of such claims given the weight of history that he faces			2
the weaknesses of both men — @entity4 in terms of his style and @entity6 in terms of his rhetoric — point out how desperate the @entity3 is to find someone who can build a broad coalition , something that is essential for a presidential victory , particularly when @entity3 will likely be facing a formidable candidate			1
the problems of @entity168 gov. @entity167 have been a huge blow to the party , and there are not many alternatives at this point who are willing to run to replace a figure who , in terms of style of governance and rhetoric , would have a better chance of appealing to voters beyond the base			1
this is the reason former @entity185 gov. @entity184 is getting so much buzz , as potentially the only other person who can fill this void			0
if @entity3 ca n't find some alternative and the primaries revolve around the tension between @entity4 and @entity6 , @entity94 will be in excellent position to retain the @entity193 in 2016 .			1

sen. @entity6 takes verbal shot at his potential 2016 rival @entity4
@entity199 says if @entity3 faces a choice between the two for nomination , watch out
he says many voters wo n't back party that 's extreme , obstructionist or libertarian
@entity199 : republicans hurt by @entity167 's woes , have to hope for @entity184 to run
