it has been a rough month or so for the @entity1 and the @entity3 administration , which has been struggling to get its signature health insurance program off the ground			1
@entity1 , the effort to extend health coverage to every @entity8 , has already achieved some of its biggest goals : no more denials of coverage for pre-existing conditions , allowing parents to keep children on their policies up to age 26 , the eventual phase - out of the " doughnut hole " for @entity20 's prescription drug coverage			1
but the big enchilada was the rollout of the online federal and state exchanges for @entity8 to shop for insurance coverage , and that has been plagued by delays since the october 1 launch			0
@entity3 also was forced to admit that his longstanding reassurance that people could keep their insurance plans if they liked them was n't holding up , as insurers began sending cancellation notices to an estimated several million people whose individual policies do n't meet @entity1 requirements for comprehensive coverage			1
so , here 's a quick look at some of the problems the @entity1 has encountered and what is being done to address them : issue : enrollments @entity46 : 7 million by march 31 status : more than 106,000 people had signed up by wednesday -- but nearly 80,000 of those joined through the exchanges set up by 14 states and the @entity52			1
the buggy federal website , which handles enrollments for 36 of the 50 states , produced fewer than 27,000			1
another 396,000 people were determined to be eligible for @entity57 or the @entity58 , but it was n't clear how many had joined those state - administered programs			2
the reaction from republicans , who unanimously opposed the legislation , was swift			0
house speaker @entity64 called the results " a symbol of the failure of the president 's health care law			0
it is a rolling calamity that must be scrapped			0
" @entity72 spokesman @entity71 conceded before the numbers came out that they would be lower than expected			1
but @entity74 , the economist who helped design the @entity76 health care program used as the model for the @entity1 , said the first month 's figures are " meaningless			1
" " the real deadline we have to focus on is march of next year , " @entity74 , who also advised the @entity3 administration , told @entity81 's the lead			0
" that 's when the individual mandate kicks in			0
that 's when people need to be signed up , and what we saw in @entity76 was a large rush before the mandate kicked in			1
" the latest on @entity1 enrollment issue : @entity94 @entity46 : a capacity of 50,000 - 60,000 users at any given time status : currently 20,000 - 25,000 , @entity72 chief technology officer @entity99 said wednesday			1
@entity100 , the chief information officer for the @entity101 , said the site can process nearly 17,000 registrations per hour			0
" we have much work still to do but are making progress at a growing rate , " @entity99 told the @entity104			0
the administration has said it aims to get the website working for a " vast majority " of @entity8 looking to enroll by november 30			2
" the team is working really hard to hit that goal , " @entity99 said wednesday			0
but rep. @entity114 , @entity115 , expressed some skepticism about that target : " as a former web developer , that was what i was telling clients when we were gon na miss a deadline			0
" official : hackers tried repeatedly to attack @entity1 website issue : retaining existing plans @entity46 : in touting the @entity1 , @entity3 repeatedly said , " if you like your health insurance , you can keep it			1
" status : no longer a selling point , as at least 1 million individual policy holders have been told their plans are being discontinued or changed at the end of the year			0
@entity135 is weighing different proposals to address the problem			2
@entity3 and other administration officials say those plans offered substandard coverage , leaving people at risk of bankruptcy if they were hospitalized or developed other major medical needs , and that the 80 % of @entity8 who are covered through their jobs or government programs such as @entity20 and @entity57 wo n't see any changes			2
but they are now qualifying the pledge by saying that people who had individual plans dating back to before the 2010 passage of the @entity1 can keep their plans as long as the policies had n't been changed by the insurance companies ; the ones that have been changed must now meet new minimum standards set in the law			1
there are multiple proposals on @entity161 to allow people to keep policies that are being canceled			2
but there 's little indication they would have any immediate effect , and industry experts say the two leading legislative plans leave many questions unanswered			0
