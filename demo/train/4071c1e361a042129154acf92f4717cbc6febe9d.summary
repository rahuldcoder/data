up to 500 people on board are thought to have died after the boat went down last week			1
@entity2 @entity11 called on @entity12 and other @entity13 and @entity15 states to track down those responsible for this " atrocious incident " and hold them accountable			1
" all the countries in the @entity7 must make a concerted effort to clamp down on the smugglers who are exploiting one of the most vulnerable groups on the planet and endangering their lives , virtually on a daily basis , purely for financial gain , " @entity19 said			1
" the callous act of deliberately ramming a boat full of hundreds of defenseless people is a crime that must not go unpunished			1
" if the survivors ' accounts are indeed true -- and they appear all too credible -- we are looking at what amounts to mass murder in the @entity7			1
" @entity19 also called for nations to tackle the root causes that led people to undertake such dangerous journeys in a bid to reach @entity15 shores			2
' they were laughing ' eleven survivors of the sinking , rescued by authorities in @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 , told interviewers from the @entity52 earlier this week that the people smugglers were @entity54 or @entity12			1
those on the boat included @entity56 , @entity54 -- many of them from @entity57 -- @entity12 and @entity59 , as well as @entity54 , the witnesses said			2
two @entity54 survivors explained that they 'd paid $ 2,000 -- money they 'd gotten after receiving grants to rebuild their homes -- at what they called a " travel " office in @entity57 for their voyage to @entity48 , according to the @entity52			2
they had packed into a boat in @entity12 's port of @entity71 and left on september 6 , they said			2
they estimated at least 400 men and women , in addition to as many as 100 children , were on board			2
five days later , the smugglers allegedly rammed their boat far out to sea between @entity49 and @entity50 , causing it to sink , after the migrants refused to move onto a smaller boat they judged to be unseaworthy			1
they 'd already been forced to transfer vessel several times , the survivors said			0
" after they hit our boat they waited to be sure that it had sunk completely before leaving			0
they were laughing , " one survivor told the @entity52			2

a week later , only 11 survivors have been found			1
@entity19 urged the @entity50 , @entity49 and @entity48 authorities to share information on the identity of the smugglers with the @entity12 authorities , who he said should also launch a thorough investigation			0
" you can not transport large quantities of foreigners in buses into a major port and cram them on board a ship without the port authorities and other witnesses being aware of what is going on , " @entity19 said			0
' this summer 's recipe for death ' according to the @entity52 , the latest reported sinking would take the death toll off @entity15 's shores this year to nearly 3,000			0
