-- on feb. 11 , 2009 , when @entity2 made his infamous monosyllabic , grunged - out appearance on " @entity4 , " it inspired an orgy of media gossip fueled by a basic question : was @entity8 having some sort of mental breakdown -- or was his whole shambling , beatnik - derelict routine an elaborate hoax ? " @entity20 , " @entity15 's fascinating and scary documentary about his brother - in - law , is powerful evidence that the answer is neither -- and that , in fact , it 's much sadder			1
the movie , an artful piece of exploitation vérité , follows @entity8 's self - righteous retirement from acting , his awkward attempt to relaunch himself as a hip - hop star , and his wasted retreat from human relationships			1
the @entity2 we see in " @entity20 " is a slurry , bloated shell of his former self , with taped sunglasses that never come off and unwashed hair that 's matted into crusty dreads			1
on stage in @entity39 , during the notorious performance where he dove into the audience to brawl with a spectator who ticked him off ( apparently an easy thing to do ) , the hapless violence that we all saw 100 times on @entity47 is less shocking than the extraordinary , dilapidated numbness of @entity8 's demeanor during his abbreviated rap song			2
standing there in his shades and overly tight suit jacket , holding his cigarette as if he could n't be bothered to put it out for his act , @entity8 , without doing much of anything , radiates such smarmy contempt that you may think : who is this -- the second coming of @entity64 's @entity63 ? a reincarnation of the last days of @entity66 ? in " @entity20 , " @entity8 keeps saying that he wants to be a hip - hop musician , but he communicates a borderline indifference even to his own performance			1
and that suggests that his real mission is n't to be a rap star at all but to act out his superiority : to the curiosity seekers in the audience , to the legion of fans and movie industry colleagues whom he 's turned his back on			0
after all , why could n't he try to launch a music career without giving up his day job -- the way that , say , @entity84 ( who appears briefly on the same stage as @entity8 in a club in @entity87 ) has done ? the answer is that it 's all about '' street cred			2
'' by trashing what he 's done before , @entity8 thinks he 's not just another lowly entertainer on puppet strings but a pure artist who does n't give a damn about celebrity			2
( even though his celebrity is the only reason anyone would begin to pay attention to his rap career			0
) he 's become the kind of convoluted narcissist who flogs his sincerity until it becomes a twisted form of phoniness			0
that bedraggled desire to declare himself above and apart from everyone else is the defining feature of what now passes for @entity2 's '' conversation			1
'' as " @entity20 " goes on , he talks and talks but never really listens , gushing forth instead in a slovenly , rambling mash - up of self - pity and self - glorification			2
the look @entity8 is going for is late - period @entity119 ( with worse hygiene ) , but he sounds like a gen - x @entity121 before rehab			0
what the film reveals is that @entity8 , whom we see repeatedly snorting cocaine ( and surrounded by empty beer bottles ) , is less an enigmatic head case than a toxically ego - fueled drug casualty			1
some of the movie is funny in a hungover , " @entity138 " - meets - @entity136 sort of way			0
when @entity139 shows up , with the script of @entity141 in hand , to offer @entity2 a role in the movie , @entity8 is so blurry and out - of - it that it 's clear he has never even looked at the script and has absolutely no idea which role he 's being pitched			1
he assumes that @entity139 wants him to play @entity141 -- which only caps how annoyed @entity139 is to be wasting his time with this bum			0
the story is n't over , though			0
when @entity139 shows up as a presenter on the @entity154 , in full - bearded @entity2 costume , it 's now clearer , in hindsight , that he was getting his revenge			1
that @entity8 's handlers -- and @entity15 -- enable his behavior by never attempting an intervention amounts to an ethical lapse			0
yet the film 's unflinching honesty is , in the end , its own justification			1
@entity15 uses @entity8 's descent to forge a riveting -- and , in its way , cautionary -- case study of a celebrity self - destructively addicted to his own psychodrama			2
@entity8 may say that he 's left acting behind , but whether he 's trolling the internet for hookers , trying ( hilariously ) to convince @entity175 to produce his rap album , getting huffy with an entertainment journalist at a junket for two lovers , or lashing out at fame while still enjoying all of its perks , the movie understands that his @entity183 in @entity184 is really a performance -- even if it 's one the actor himself is only dimly aware of			1
the real hoax is the one that @entity8 has perpetrated on himself			0
it 's the illusion ( to quote one of his bad hip - hop songs ) that he 's a '' compli - f --- in ' - cated '' rebel rather than just another vain burnout who needs help			0
