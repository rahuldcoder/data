-- @entity3 's @entity2 - mediated mini-comeback continues ! following an interview with @entity5 on today -- and in preparation for her hosting gig on this weekend 's " @entity9 " -- @entity3 swung by thursday 's episode of " @entity11 with @entity12			1
" the genial @entity13 asked @entity3 just how , exactly , she landed the hosting gig			1
@entity3 claimed that she 'd been pestering " snl " czar @entity15 for a return trip to " snl " for a long time			1
" i kept asking him , " she said			0
" i was n't giving up			2
" @entity15 apparently ran into @entity3 in @entity18 , and offered her the job on the spot : " you know @entity15 , he 's very straight to the point , " said @entity3			2
" he was like , ' what about march 3 ? ' i 'm like , ' i 'm free ! ' " the ever - excitable @entity13 was kind to the eternally beleaguered starlet , focusing his questions mostly on " snl " and on her just - announced role as @entity28 in an upcoming @entity30 movie			1
" what 's the name of the movie ? " asked @entity13			0
" @entity35 and @entity36 , " said @entity3 , who endearingly could n't understand why the audience immediately erupted into laughter			2
( oh , get your mind out of the gutter ! ) from there , @entity13 lightly skipped over the last eight years of @entity3 's career , guiding the conversation into an mutual reminiscence about the very first " @entity45 " sketch back in 2004			2
if there was one awkward note in the interview , it came when @entity3 asked @entity13 -- apparently out of the blue -- if he 'd be interested in swinging by " snl " this weekend			1
( @entity13 seemed nonplussed , and @entity3 admitted she did n't know exactly what his role would be			1
) the actress stuck around to play a round of @entity58			0
the clues included " @entity60 , " " @entity61 , " and " corndog			0
" ( oh , get your mind out of the gutter ! ) it was , in short , an undeniably pleasant interview that offered absolutely no indication whether this weekend 's " snl " will be a comeback event , a trainwreck , or a postmodern trainwreck comeback event			0
