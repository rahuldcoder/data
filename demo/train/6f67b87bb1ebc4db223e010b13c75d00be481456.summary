-- if it seems like nearly everyone you see these days , from kids to seniors , has some kind of tech gadget handy , it 's not just your imagination			0
according to a new report from the @entity12 , nearly 90 % of @entity10 now own a cell phone , computer , mp3 player , game console , e-book reader or tablet computer			2
in generations and their gadgets , @entity12 explores how age groups in the @entity10 tend to use their tech devices			2
it defines six generations ranging from age 18 to 75 - plus			0
a few highlights about how @entity10 of different ages use mobile devices : cell phones eighty - five percent of @entity10 currently own cell phones , making it the single most popular type of tech gadget			1
slightly more @entity10 use their cell phones to take pictures ( 76 % ) than to send or receive text messages ( 72 % ) -- but across all age groups , those two non-voice call activities are the most popular			1
among the 15 % of @entity10 who do not own a cell phone , one - third live in a household with at least one working cell phone			1
so , overall , " 90 % of all adults ( including 62 % of those age 75 and older ) live in a household with at least one working cell phone , " the survey finds			2
also , @entity12 notes that as of june , about a quarter of all @entity10 households had gone mobile - only , ditching their traditional " landline " phone connections			1
this includes more than half of all adults ages 25 to 29 , and it indicates how crucial it is to update the @entity10 911 emergency calling system to be more friendly to cell phones , as well as to accommodate more types of communication than voice calls			1
even though more people are getting smartphones ( 30 percent of @entity10 cell phone owners , by most estimates ) , only @entity10 ages 18 to 34 are especially likely to use their phones for several purposes : internet access , e-mail , games , getting or playing music , sending or receiving photos , recording video , etc. the only widely popular activities across all age groups are taking pictures and text messaging , which may explain why 70 % of @entity10 still rely on non-smart " feature phones , " which have fewer bells and whistles			1
@entity79 players as tech gadgets go , mp3 players are relatively limited devices			0
so it 's a bit surprising that the youngest and most tech - savvy age group @entity12 studied is by far the most likely to own an mp3 player			0
three - quarters of @entity10 ages 18 to 34 own an mp3 player , but only 56 % of the next oldest group ( 35 to 46 ) do			2
tablets as of september , 5 % of @entity10 adults owned tablet computers such as the @entity93 or @entity94 , up from 3 % in may			0
( @entity95 's popular @entity93 hit @entity10 stores in april			0
) with the launch of several @entity99 - based @entity93 competitors , expect this kind of device to become much more popular in the next year			0
it 'll be interesting to see whether tablet ownership starts to displace some ownership of laptop computers			0
e-readers currently , 5 % of @entity10 own e-reader devices such as the @entity108 , but this vastly underestimates the total number of people who read e-books			1
many people read e-books on their smartphones , tablets , and desktop or laptop computers			0
e-reader devices are most popular among @entity10 ages 47 to 56			1
i suspect that in the next year , tablets will shake up all kinds of patterns of mobile device ownership and use in the @entity10 if tablet prices start to drop and more options for size and connectivity emerge ( especially likely for @entity99 models ) , it 's possible that that many people who rely primarily on feature phones might choose to invest in a @entity135 - enabled tablet ( a one - time expense ) rather than upgrading to a full smartphone ( with higher monthly bills and often unexpected charges )			1
the opinions expressed in this story are solely those of @entity142 .			0

eighty - five percent of @entity10 currently own cell phones
about a quarter of all @entity10 households have gone mobile phone - only
five percent of @entity10 own e-reader devices such as the @entity108 or nook
