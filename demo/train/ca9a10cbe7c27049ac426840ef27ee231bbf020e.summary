@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's the law of unintended consequences			2
each time @entity6 spend billions to fortify the border by building fences or hiring @entity10 agents , human traffickers raise their prices			2
today , it costs about $ 3,000 to move a person across the border			2
it 's less if you brave mountain lions and cross off the beaten path			2
it 's more if you cross near civilization and absolutely positively have to be there overnight			2
if we bolster enforcement , the price could soar to $ 6,000			0
how do we win a battle against an opponent when , the more we spend to defeat him , the more we empower him to fight back ? this riddle could stump anyone , but president @entity29 seems to find it especially difficult			1
raised in @entity31 and having lived in @entity32 , @entity29 is a newbie to the border			1
he 's made one memorable visit in @entity36 as president and he must have felt as if he landed on another planet			1
even on this week 's fundraising swing through @entity40 , @entity29 could n't find time to visit the border			1
when you travel from @entity0 to @entity46 , @entity47 , to @entity48 , @entity49 , to @entity50 , @entity40 , it 's like you 're visiting several worlds at once			2
each stretch has its own script			0
it 's a fascinating area -- unless you 're not interested			0
@entity29 does n't seem all that interested in the border , except when he can use it as a weapon			1
in may 2011 , during a visit to @entity60 , @entity40 , @entity29 mocked republicans by saying they wanted to build a moat on the border and fill it with alligators			1
this week , in @entity65 , more than 500 miles from the border , the president revealed his plans for tens of thousands of kids whose heads are filled with nightmares			2
since october , spurred by violent youth gangs in their home countries and fake news reports of " permisos " for young people approved by @entity78 , about 52,000 children and teenagers from @entity72 have been apprehended on the border			2
" apprehended " is too generous a word , since most of these people reportedly went up to @entity10 agents with their arms raised and asked to be arrested			0
these uninvited guests are neither invading nor evading			0
a lot of @entity40 @entity85 probably thought it was a bad idea for @entity29 to snub the border , and one said so out loud			1
@entity6 rep. @entity88 , @entity89 , suggested that @entity29 's failure to survey firsthand the scene of the crisis evoked memories of president @entity94 viewing the devastation of @entity96 from an airplane flying high overhead			1
this week , @entity88 said : " i hope this does n't become the @entity96 moment for president @entity29 , saying that he does n't need to come to the border			1
" now that @entity6 officials have custody of the border kids , many of whom were -- according to media reports -- sexually assaulted or had their lives threatened , the hard part is deciding what to do with them			0
do we really want to send them back ? are we that monstrous ? @entity29 has asked @entity78 for $ 3.7 billion to deal with the crisis -- which includes $ 1.8 billion to help the @entity115 provide better care for the children , and another $ 1.6 billion to help the @entity118 and the @entity119 expedite their removal			1
the remaining $ 300 million would go to the @entity121 to help @entity123 governments counter the misinformation campaign			0
this budgetary whiplash -- where we show these kids some kindness before banishing them to the dark , desperate and dangerous places from which they escaped -- summarizes @entity29 's muddled approach to the immigration issue , where he tries to be both tough and compassionate and winds up confused			1
we need more border funding , but we could also use a lot more honestly and clarity in this debate			0
money ca n't buy that			0
liberals will have to swallow the fact that it was their foil , @entity94 , who signed a law in 2008 giving safe haven to unaccompanied minors from @entity72 , and now it 's their champion , @entity29 , who seeks the power to override it			1
meanwhile , conservatives are putting up a fight against the funding , but that wo n't last			1
they ca n't stand the idea of letting these kids stay here and grow up to become dependents and @entity85 , and so they have to help @entity29 fund their return			1
for a while , there will be a tug - of - war in the @entity158 between the border hawks and budget hawks			0
but the former will win			0
that 's a good outcome			0
it would also be good for @entity78 to pass immigration reform , and for @entity29 to ease up on deportations			1
for now , the administration needs the $ 3.7 billion , and it should get every penny			0
@entity78 should be generous , and the president should be diligent , but neither of them should be naive			0
on the border , enforcement dollars are no silver bullet			0
we can hire more @entity10 agents , build more walls , and expedite deportations			0
but none of that will stop the downtrodden , desperate , and determined from seeking refuge in a country that is supposed to be in the business of offering it			1
and if @entity29 spent more time on the border , he 'd already know that			2
join us on @entity188 / @entity187 .			0

@entity190 : president @entity29 should visit the border in light of crisis
