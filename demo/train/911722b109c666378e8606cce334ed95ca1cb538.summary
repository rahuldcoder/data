she is tense and has lost weight , her lawyer , @entity9 , told reporters			2
and she is facing a difficult legal battle , he said			1
rather than prosecutors having to prove she is guilty , " we have to prove her innocence , which is more difficult to do , " @entity9 said			1
her stepfather , @entity17 , said she had a " a very strong appeal " and there were " ample grounds for @entity3 's release			0
" he said he experienced deja vu walking back in the court where she was convicted nearly a year ago and seeing " a new jury , new judge -- new judges			2
unfortunately the old prosecutor , still , but you ca n't get everything			0
" the hearing lasted about 15 minutes before the judge adjourned it until december 11 because one of the lawyers was not present			0
@entity35 , 23 , was sentenced last december to 26 years in prison for the killing of @entity38 at the villa they shared in @entity0 , the central @entity1 town where both were students			1
@entity42 , 21 , was found in november 2007 , semi-naked with her throat slashed			2

a third person , @entity38 , a drifter originally from the @entity49 , was tried separately and is serving a 16 - year prison sentence			1
@entity42 's family is following the appeal , lawyer @entity51 said			2
" of course , this is a phase in which they want to remember @entity38 and think about @entity38 and they hope to be able to just dedicate themselves to her memory without having to deal with trials anymore , " he said			0
@entity35 's family said in april that she is innocent and that no forensic evidence puts her at the crime scene			2
" @entity38 was @entity3 's friend , " the family said			0
" they liked each other and spent time together when not in school			0
@entity3 would not hurt @entity38			0
" the family said the appeal would detail " a lot of conjecture in these motivations , a number of discrepancies as well as a number of inconsistencies and contradictions ; as well as conclusions not supported by evidence			0
