-- smartphones inch closer to becoming remote controls for your life at next week 's 2013 @entity4 in @entity5			1
the annual event is the largest gadget conference in the world , where major technology companies and scrappy startups can show off their latest innovations			1
if the show sets the tone for the year 's technology , 2013 will be about watching tv on your 5 - inch smartphone while your self - driving car ferries you to work			1
companies will continue to try to connect everything to the @entity22 -- lights , power outlets , cars , cameras , kitchen appliances -- and allow you to control them from a mobile device			1
there have been some big changes at this year 's conference			0
longtime headliner @entity34 has dropped out of @entity4 , and mobile devices are increasingly saving their big announcements for the @entity39 event in february			1
but hopefully the void is filled by exciting discoveries and gadgets we ca n't predict			0
television : it 's about the content there will be wide , thin , innovative tvs at @entity4			1
they will have glorious high - resolution oled screens and cost way too much money for the average consumer , when and if they become available			2
@entity54 is teasing a tv that is a possibly a new shape or translucent , and @entity56 has a 110 - inch led tv with @entity58			1
but the big television story this year will be the industry 's continuing quest to break out of these beautiful boxes and move onto tablets and smartphones			2
how people consume content has changed drastically in the past few years			2
they are cutting cords with the cable companies and signing up for on - demand services such as @entity70 and @entity71 , or buying shows and movies through @entity74 or @entity75			2
viewers want to watch tv on their smartphones and tablets			2
they are multitasking , watching the " @entity80 " while commenting on @entity79			0
in response , television companies will attempt to connect tvs to the @entity22 and share content between mobile devices , set - top boxes and televisions			1
home automation and the art of connecting everything there is very little in your home that wo n't be connected to the internet if electronics manufacturers have their say			0
cheap sensors are making it easy to turn devices you 've used without much thought into " smart " devices that do a bit of the thinking for you			2
connected devices for the home and your health will be plentiful at @entity4			1
thanks to impeccable design , the nest automated thermostat was one of the first commercial hits in this area , though others had tried integrating automation into existing home gadgets before			0
this year , smartphones will be on a bit of a power trip , getting apps to control home security , unlock doors , conserve energy and tinker with lighting			0
cars get smarter and go online auto companies will have a larger presence at @entity4 this year , with @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and others showing off technology to make cars smarter			1
there will be self - driving and assisted - driving cars , which use a combination of mounted cameras , sensors and gps to can take the wheel completely or just help a driver into a tight parking spot			0
vehicles are connecting to the @entity22 to improve navigation , better monitor a car 's performance and alert the driver to maintenance needs			0
they are also taking a cue from ( and synching with ) smartphones			0
cars will continue to integrate apps , voice control and entertainment into the dash , some even running on the @entity159 operating system			2
the hot smartphone size is 5 inches mobile device unveilings probably will be at a minimum this year , since the major companies are saving their big announcements for the @entity39 conference in @entity166 next month			1
there will be a few smartphones making their debut next week , though , and for the most part , they will have nearly identical specs : @entity159 , 5 - inch 1080p display , quad - core processor , 13 - megapixel camera			1
a few entries could mix it up , including a rumored 6.1 - inch @entity179 device from @entity180 and the company 's first @entity183 handset , the @entity184			1
smartphone accessories will flood the floor , with the usual glut of headphones , cases and stands			0
touchscreen computers and cheap tablets last year 's hot computer was the super-thin ultrabook laptop , but that category has cooled down significantly			2
this year , the spotlight will be on tablet / laptop hybrids running @entity198			0
the new @entity200 operating system is built for touchscreen computers , and manufacturers seem to be having some fun with the form factor			0
( check out the @entity206 and @entity205			0
) cheap , sub- $ 100 7 - inch @entity159 tablets will still abound , but like smartphones , there wo n't be much in the way of innovation as companies hold back until february			1
room for smaller , innovative companies the big players lying low presents a great opportunity for the smaller exhibitors to get noticed and make connections			1
this year , innovative technology will come from unexpected places as smaller companies such as @entity222 , a smart - watch company that got started as a @entity225 campaign , debut products			1
now that it 's easier for a small operation to raise money and manufacture a physical product on a budget , the gadget market is ripe for a shakeup			0
some big - name startups will also have a presence			0
@entity236 will be on the floor , and its motion - sensing technology will appear in @entity206 notebooks this year			0
@entity240 will return this year after making a splash with its @entity243 game tablet in 2012 .			0

the annual @entity4 kicks off monday
televisions will be huge , and companies will *experiment* with new ways to deliver content
mobile devices will be *generic* , with a few 5 - inch smartphones and cheap @entity159 tablets
with large companies lying low at @entity4 , smaller players have a chance to stand out
