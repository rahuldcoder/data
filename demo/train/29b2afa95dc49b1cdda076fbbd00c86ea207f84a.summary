@entity0 -- in one move wednesday , president @entity2 managed to reshape his national security team , bring longtime confidante @entity5 to the @entity6 and annoy @entity8 critics of the @entity10 ambassador			1
@entity2 announced in the @entity11 that @entity12 , who got caught up in political controversy over the @entity15 , @entity16 , terrorist attack , will replace the retiring @entity17 in the influential foreign policy post of national security adviser			1
@entity17 will step down in july following this weekend 's meetings between @entity2 and @entity22 president @entity21			0
the president also said he would nominate @entity24 of the @entity25 to succeed @entity12 at the @entity10			1
by choosing two women known as advocates for human rights , including the @entity30 - led intervention in @entity16 with @entity32 support , @entity2 signaled a potentially more robust foreign policy in his second term			0
at the same time , his decision to make @entity12 the head of his national security team angered @entity8 who are demanding further details on what they believe was a politically motivated effort by the administration to downplay the @entity15 attack in the middle of last year 's election campaign			1
while @entity2 made no direct reference to the politics of the announcement , he praised @entity12 for being " fearless , tough " and a great patriot who champions justice and human dignity			1
" i 'm absolutely thrilled she 'll be back at my side , leading my national security team for my second term , " @entity2 said with a smiling @entity12 at his side			1
@entity12 became the focus of @entity8 criticism after the terrorist attack last september 11 on a @entity32 diplomatic post in @entity15 that killed four @entity32 , including ambassador @entity59			2
five days after the assault that came on the anniversary of the 2001 terror attacks , @entity12 appeared on sunday news shows to say it was a spontaneous development during a protest , rather than a terrorist strike			0
she had been considered a top contender to succeed secretary of state @entity69 at the start of @entity2 's second term , but @entity8 opposition over the erroneous @entity74 talking points she had delivered forced her to withdraw her name from consideration in december			1
@entity78 on @entity5 : she speaks for the president @entity2 ultimately nominated former @entity32 sen. @entity80 for the post			1
as national security adviser , @entity12 will play a key role in developing and guiding the administration 's foreign policy			1
unlike a @entity88 post , the appointment requires no @entity90 confirmation , allowing @entity2 to avoid a showdown with @entity8 in giving a new job to one of his most public foreign policy voices during the 2008 presidential campaign			2
@entity12 also has been a deputy secretary of state and was previously considered a possible candidate for the national security adviser job when @entity2 appointed @entity17			1
she said wednesday that she was " humbled " to serve as @entity2 's national security adviser and thanked the president for his confidence in her			1
mindful of the need to work with the various government , law enforcement and military entities involved in national security , she declared her admiration for " the exemplary work done every day by our colleagues at @entity113 , @entity114 , the intelligence community and across the government " to keep the nation safe			2
to columnist and @entity1 contributor @entity119 , @entity2 's choice of @entity12 and @entity24 showed the freedom he felt now that he won the last election of his career last year			1
" @entity5 is not on the @entity8 ' christmas card list , but this appointment , which does n't need @entity90 confirmation , is being read as a slap in the face , " @entity119 said			2
" president @entity2 says he does n't much care			2
he is rewarding @entity5 for her loyalty to his administration and moving her into the @entity6			0
she can have more influence now than she ever did on @entity6 policy			0
" he called it a " fascinating , decisive move " by a president " who is apparently liberated by a second term , who is not worried about burning bridges with @entity8 and @entity142 who are already his critics			1
" republicans immediately criticized @entity2 's choice , with conservative @entity8 rep. @entity146 of @entity148 tweeting : " judgement is key to national security matters			1
that alone should disqualify @entity5 from her appointment			0
" sen. @entity153 of @entity154 , a leading @entity8 voice on foreign policy , tweeted that he disagreed with @entity2 's appointment but added that he would " make every effort to work " with @entity12 on important issues			2
in a statement later wednesday , @entity153 expressed support for @entity162 , calling her " well - qualified " for the job as @entity10 ambassador and saying he hoped the @entity90 would act quickly on her nomination			2
@entity24 worked for @entity2 's campaign in 2008 until she resigned after referring to @entity167 -- the other leading @entity168 contender at the time -- as a " monster			0
" she is senior director for multilateral affairs and human rights at the @entity25 and a former special assistant to the president			0
power also has written extensively on preventing genocide , with criticism of the @entity10 for failing to stop attacks in @entity178 and @entity179			0
@entity119 called @entity2 's move " a coalescing within the @entity2 administration " by promoting " two women who are in policy terms not that far from their @entity8 critics			1
" " the president is circling the wagons , appointing stronger supporters from his inner circle			0
that 's what second - term presidents do , " @entity119 said , adding " these are actually strong , confident moves in a @entity168 foreign policy that believes in humanitarian intervention			0
" now , he said , the roles of @entity12 and @entity162 raise " real questions about what the administration will do going forward in @entity200 , " where critics at home and abroad contend the @entity2 administration has failed to intervene as needed			0
@entity2 called himself " wistful " to be losing @entity17 , the former deputy national security adviser who @entity2 picked to replace retired @entity204 gen. @entity203 in october 2010			1
@entity17 was heavily involved in the raid to kill @entity206 in 2011 , as well as the administration 's strategic shift of foreign policy focus to @entity210			0
@entity17 , who also was chief of staff to secretary of state @entity211 in the @entity167 administration , is married to @entity213 , whom @entity2 recently nominated to be the @entity215 's ambassador at large for global women 's issues			2
the president lauded @entity17 's commitment , including in - person briefings almost every day in recent years on a portfolio that covered " literally the entire world			0
" " i 'm personally grateful for your advice , for your counsel , most of all for your friendship , " @entity2 said , adding that " a president ca n't ask for anything more " than the contributions and service of @entity17			0
when he finished , the two men shook hands and embraced			0
@entity2 nominates three to bench , courts political fight @entity1 's @entity235 and @entity236 contributed to this report .			0
