it 's time to reset the @entity2 debate			0
on the first anniversary of the first published leaks about the @entity7 's far - reaching surveillance programs , the discussions remain focused on the tradeoffs between individual privacy and @entity11 security			1
despite government officials ' attempts to justify the value of @entity7 programs , experts have pointed out that the vast surveillance apparatus is not effective at protecting @entity11 from terrorism			1
in fact , there 's compelling evidence that @entity7 activities are hurting the @entity11			1
they threaten our economic interests , undermine our foreign policy objectives and damage the security of the global @entity28			1
in less than a year , @entity11 companies such as @entity30 and @entity31 reported declining sales overseas and lost business opportunities			2
foreign companies are turning @entity11 surveillance into a competitive advantage			2
for example , @entity37 has marketed " e-mail made in @entity42 " as a secure alternative after the @entity7 leaks			2
meanwhile , the cloud computing industry is projected to lose between $ 25 billion and $ 180 billion in the next three to five years as customers become increasingly concerned about where their private data is stored			0
and proposals by @entity42 and @entity47 that would require data on their citizens be stored locally could compound @entity11 business losses			2
@entity7 's surveillance programs have also impacted @entity11 foreign policy goals and hurt our relations with strategic allies , as we 've found in preparing for an upcoming report on the topic			1
the credibility of the @entity62 agenda , a major initiative launched by secretary of state @entity59 in 2010 , has been sapped			0
@entity63 and @entity64 , which have sought to exert greater control over the internet for many years , are growing more skeptical of the @entity11 role in governance of the @entity28			2
@entity42 chancellor @entity69 was enraged to discover that the @entity7 had listened to calls on her personal cell phone , creating tension between the @entity11 and @entity42 as the two must work together on issues such as the @entity76 crisis			1
@entity78 president @entity77 became the first world leader to turn down a state dinner with the @entity81			0
moreover , the disclosures exposed various ways the @entity7 has actively undermined internet security in the past decade			1
under the guise of providing technical expertise , the agency deliberately weakened international encryption standards adopted by the @entity89			1
encryption forms the basis for trust on the @entity28 , and developers in the @entity11 and around the world rely on the institute 's technical standards to build secure products			1
additionally , the @entity7 quietly asked individual companies to insert backdoors into their products to facilitate spying and covertly stockpiled information about security vulnerabilities that @entity7 hackers discovered in commercial products , rather than responsibly notifying vendors so they could patch their products			1
the @entity7 has even carried out offensive hacking operations such as spoofing @entity109 and @entity110 to perform " man - in - the - middle " attacks to insert malware onto targets ' devices			0
the @entity117 administration has undertaken modest steps to mitigate the damage caused by the @entity7 and begin the slow , difficult process of rebuilding trust in the @entity11 as a responsible steward of modern communications networks			1
in january , president @entity117 issued @entity124 28 , which placed some limitations on authorities to collect signals intelligence			0
in may , the @entity128 passed the @entity129 , which is quite watered down but could still bring about limited reform to the bulk collection program			0
the @entity89 convened a group of outside experts to review its cryptographic standards and guidelines , and there are proposals to remove the statutory requirement that it consult with the @entity7 on certain standards			2
these proposals are narrow in scope			0
further reforms must be broader			0
in the coming months , lawmakers must continue to strengthen protections against data collection on @entity11 and foreigners , here and abroad			0
the government must also recommit to the @entity62 agenda and move toward robust international standards on surveillance that are grounded in human rights			0
finally , more transparency is needed			0
last fall , a coalition of major @entity28 companies joined privacy experts and public interest advocates in calling for far greater corporate and government transparency , asking that they be allowed to release more detailed information about the quantity , nature and scope of requests they receive from intelligence officials			0
the unlikely partnerships that have sprung up in the past year between of some of @entity28 's biggest rivals speak to the seriousness of the threats to their collective business interests			2
while the initial shock of @entity7 surveillance may have faded a bit , the deeper concerns are not going away any time soon			0
that 's why we need a firm commitment to reforms that go above and beyond the provisions of the @entity128 's @entity129			1
companies need to be able to inform consumers around the world in much greater detail about the scope and impact of the @entity7 's surveillance programs -- an important step to stopping businesses and individuals from permanently turning away from the @entity11 to escape the surveillance dragnet .			1

it 's been a year since @entity195 's disclosures about @entity7 spying
@entity198 , @entity199 : @entity7 programs hurt @entity11 economic interests and policies
they say the agency has also deliberately weakened internet security and standards
@entity198 , @entity209 : we need a firm commitment from @entity11 government to reform the @entity7
