@entity0 , @entity1 -- shoes tell a lot about a person			2
if you stumbled into my closet , you would probably think i was a security guard , a construction worker or a @entity11 wannabe			2
my taste in shoes tends to be boxy , low - heeled and sturdy			1
if the equipment is n't cleaned properly , you could be at risk for infection when you get a pedicure			1
so it probably does n't surprise you to learn that when it comes to pedicures , i am hardly a nail salon enabler			1
unfortunately , in some sort of twisted cosmic comedy , both my teen and my tween daughters are pedicure addicts			2
to pedicure addicts , there is nothing better than being seated in those massive padded massage chairs , chin deep in fashion magazines , while some woman bathes , chisels , files and paints their toes			2
and up until now , the only thing i worried about was how much the extra flower motif on her big toe was going to cost me			0
now , i have plenty of other stuff to worry about			0
dr. @entity42 , a podiatrist in @entity43 , made it clear			0
" i definitely see patients that have had problems as a result of getting a pedicure , " she said			0
" i guess the most common is fungal nails			1
" fungal nails ! ! ! i really do n't want to pay for that			1
the @entity52 , unfortunately , describes fungal nail in less - than - clear terms : fungal nail infection is an infection of the nails by a fungus			1
prescription treatments are only about 50 percent effective , and most of these infections usually require the loss of the infected nail itself , the @entity52 web site says			1
cuts , scrapes and some other infections are also common results of seemingly soothing foot romps			1
@entity42 thinks it 's nothing new			0
" i think it 's a chronic problem that has been going on for a while , " she said			0
" people just maybe chose to ignore it or do n't pay attention as much as they should			1
" anyone who did pay attention could have known about some of those risks eight years ago			0
that 's when the @entity81 reported finding a nasty infection that hit more than 100 pedicure patients			0
the culprit : a less - than - sterile footbath screen			2
the result : an infection called mycobacterium fortuitum			0
that mouthful of a malady left these customers , most of them women , with prolonged boils on their lower legs and some long - term scars			2
although that report prompted nail salons to clean the screens on those foot baths more often , it does n't mean that in the land of pedicure pampering , you can just relax and enjoy the polishing			0
@entity42 's chief advice is to be on high cleanliness alert			0
" i tell patients to make sure that the bathtubs are being cleaned properly , that they are using enough time in between so the disinfectant has time to work , " she said			1
and the magic timeframe , according to the @entity109 , is about 10 minutes between clients			1
the @entity109 also stresses that to ensure the safest conditions , the tubs need to be cleaned with an @entity109 - registered hospital disinfectant , which means the bottle itself will have a @entity109 registration number listed somewhere on the label			1
but it 's not just the tubs that need to be clean			2
" make sure that instruments are getting sterilized properly , " @entity42 cautions , " that they are using a sterilizer or an autoclave to properly sanitize the instruments or using the liquids for the proper periods of time			1
" timing is also important , but that 's a condition that 's on your side			0
do n't get a pedicure right after you 've shaved your legs , had laser hair removal or have any cuts or bites on your legs			0
any opening in the skin is an invitation that you might not want to be extending			0
and finally , make sure you can communicate with your nail technician to ensure he or she is taking the proper precautions to make your pedicure a stress - free experience and , more important , to ensure that the only thing you 're taking with you when you leave that salon is the pretty polish .			1
