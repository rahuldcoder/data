-- at 9:40 a.m. on december 14 , @entity2 's attention was turned to @entity3 , @entity4 , where 20 children and six adults were gunned down in an elementary school			1
the nation was grief - stricken			0
president @entity9 arrived two days later operating as consoler - in - chief , and the dialogue immediately commenced on what steps should be taken to prevent another @entity3			1
shortly after 9 p.m. on december 27 , @entity15 police found the body of @entity17 outside a convenience store , marking the 500th homicide of the year in the @entity15 , most of them due to gun violence			1
as far as i know , no pictures of @entity17 were shown on national tv			0
flowers and teddy bears did n't populate the scene			1
his death has largely been ignored by the national media , except for the basic acknowledgment that he represented the city 's 500th homicide			0
think about this for a moment			0
our world stopped in the wake of the @entity3 massacre , and rightfully so			1
those killed , including the gunman 's mother , were innocent victims , gunned down by a madman			1
but in @entity15 alone , residents have experienced the equivalent of 19 @entity48 this year			1
and we move about our daily lives as if @entity17 's murder does n't mean a thing			1
it is because of this that i 've been angered to watch tv , listen to radio and follow these senseless , emotional and one - dimensional debates about gun control in the @entity2			0
@entity3 and @entity59 and @entity15 did n't happen just because of guns			1
there were conditions that preceded these heinous acts that deserve our attention			0
instead , the tragedy has allowed the usual suspects to declaim from one side or the other			0
it 's either @entity71 or restrict guns			2
very little else has broken through to put this gun violence epidemic into the proper context			0
opinion : @entity76 , a gunmaker ripe for an ethical takeover dr. @entity79 and @entity80 sounded stunningly similar notes by suggesting that because the victims of other gun violence did n't look like the @entity3 victims , the national media essentially did n't care			1
i personally know @entity79 has tried to address the issue ; nothing tells me limbaugh really cares other than to score a point against " the liberal media			0
" that 's a reasonable issue to confront and analyze , but it 's not the only one			0
mental illness has been discussed , but it has been a distant second to the loud voices championing a ban on assault weapons , background checks or closing gun show loopholes			0
very few media sources have done extensive reporting on mental illness budgets in their cities and states			2
yet we ca n't examine @entity3 without dealing with " stand your ground " laws in @entity108 and other states			1
we ca n't say reinstate the assault weapons ban and not talk about whether strict gun control laws actually work			1
the gun violence issue is multilayered			0
access to guns is one thing ; what we do with guns is another			2
we take solace in the @entity119 saying overall crime is down , but according to @entity122 , 14,159 people were victims of homicide in 2010			2
it is true that most people who possess guns do n't go around shooting people			1
but the thousands of homicides due to guns should be alarming to anyone , even the most ardent @entity129 advocate			2
opinion : our dad did n't let evil get the last word if we are going to keep saying , " let 's have a conversation , " then by @entity136 let 's do it			2
right now , we are seeing advocates against guns and for guns try to score points and demonize one another			2
that 's not a conversation			0
it 's an exercise in futility			0
issues such as education , poverty , income disparities , anger , violent video games and images , and many others must be looked at if we want to come to grips with @entity2 's deadly infatuation with guns			1
again , not everything is a direct cause			0
but any psychologist will tell you that a variety of factors lead to someone killing one person or 20			0
for my media brothers and sisters , we have done a weak job at making this conversation broad and in - depth			0
we ca n't give it short shrift and think that a seven - minute panel will do the trick			2
we ca n't put so much attention on @entity3 and ignore @entity15			1
it 's not just about what happens in @entity179 , but also in state houses , commissioners ' courts and city halls across the land			0
if we continue at this rate , @entity3 will be an afterthought , thus becoming another missed opportunity to address a major epidemic in @entity2			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			1

*hundreds* of people have been killed by guns this year in @entity15 , says @entity191
but @entity3 , @entity59 and @entity15 did n't happen just because of guns , he says
we must deal with " stand your ground " laws in @entity108 and other states , he says
issues such as education , poverty and anger must also be dealt with , he says
