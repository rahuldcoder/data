seriously funny ? we 'll see			2
@entity8 's " the @entity7 " debuted on @entity4 monday night , taking over the " @entity5 " time slot			1
and right from the start , it was apparent , the show was n't going to shy away from race			2
one of his first jokes ? " a brother finally gets a show on late night tv , but , of course , he has to work on @entity17			2
" yes , " the @entity7 " not just dove right into racial humor			1
it swam in it , skewering everything in its path			2
on climate change : " if we do n't figure this out , then it wo n't just be black people saying , ' i ca n't breathe			2
' " on @entity32 : " @entity30 , slow down man			2
you do n't have to respond to every black emergency			2
you 're not black @entity36			0
" but predictible , it was n't			0
" a very powerful motion picture was snubbed			0
this film 's message is as poignant today as it was when i was a kid , " he said , as he prepared to dress down the @entity43 and its snub of black talent in this year 's nomination			1
and then the punchline : " how did the " @entity48 " movie not get nominated for best picture ? " if you 're not familiar with him , @entity8 's a writer and comedian , who has largely made his mark behind the scenes			1
he 's popped up occasionally on " @entity55 " as " senior black correspondent , " but he 's devoted much of his career to writing and producing			1
it did n't start out that way			0
in the 1980s , he dropped out of college to become an actor and stand - up comedian			0
( you may remember him as a police officer on " @entity65			0
" ) it was a few years later when he decided to become a tv writer			0
as @entity8 tells it , he was just being practical			1
" i knew @entity76 was n't going to find me , " he told @entity70 of his acting years , when the standard casting call wanted black men closer to @entity75 's fast - talking types			1
" i needed to be able to control my own destiny			0
being an actor was too flighty			0
" after success as a writer for " in @entity81 , " " @entity82 " and " @entity83 , " he turned producer with " @entity85 , " the animated @entity75 show , and the offbeat " @entity87			0
" his brother @entity88 is a writer for " @entity89			0
" in monday 's debut , " the @entity7 " was n't all fun and games			1
@entity8 hosted a 10 - minute panel discussion on the " state of protests " in the nation , featuring @entity98 sen. @entity97 , rapper / activist @entity99 , comedian @entity100 and show contributor @entity101			1
making a point about the perception of black men in @entity98 , @entity8 asked the sharp - dressed senator from @entity107 a rhetorical question			1
" you look very nice in a suit			0
do you feel like you 're just a hoodie away from being face down in the pavement ? " funny ? yes			0
seriously funny ? there 's no doubt that @entity8 is out to make a point and have @entity98 join in on the conversation			1
