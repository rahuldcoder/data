-- for far too long , according to @entity4 chairman @entity3 , his committee was nothing more than " a u-haul trailer of money for a presidential nominee " who lacked a permanent , sustainable presence in crucial states			1
" we had been a party that has shown up once every four years about five months before an election , " @entity3 told @entity0 , arguing that no matter how much money you have , that model wo n't work and has n't worked in recent years			1
so after the drubbing the party took at the ballot box in 2012 -- failing to win the @entity20 and losing seats in the @entity20 -- @entity3 ordered a much - talked about top - down review of the party in an effort to stop @entity25 for taking big losses during presidential elections			1
the report -- titled the " @entity29 " -- was stark and blunt , challenging the @entity25 to make substantial changes to the way it interacted with voters			1
@entity25 want to end perception as ' stuffy old men ' less than a year after the report was released and as @entity25 nationally venture to @entity37 for the group 's winter confab , @entity3 and other @entity4 leaders are looking back on 2013 and heralding the moves they made in implementing their plan			1
" a lot of it comes down to mechanics , " @entity3 said			2
" here is the point , if you are not in @entity50 communities on a year - round basis			0
if you do n't represent those congressional districts , if you do n't represent those @entity55 districts , who is there ? who is there telling the story of the @entity25 , of opportunity and freedom			0
" there are fundamental areas that @entity4 re-tooling has focused on : improving a lackluster ground game , growing @entity4 standing in minority communities , investing in a data infrastructure and revamping the @entity29 primary system			1
all of this , @entity3 and others said , is in an effort to turn into a year - round organization with a sustainable presence in crucial states			1
after president @entity79 beat @entity4 nominee @entity80 on the way to winning reelection in 2012 , many in the party felt changes needed to be made			1
as the @entity29 report touts on one of its first pages , it had " lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections " and @entity79 just won the @entity50 vote by a whopping 44 % , @entity90 by over 80 % and @entity91 by 47 %			1
in response to these losses , according to @entity93 , the @entity4 's deputy political director and the head of demographic specific outreach , the party has put minority engagement staff in sixteen states			1
the @entity4 is especially proud of that - pointing out that 78 % of the @entity4 's political staff is outside of @entity37 , -- but not fully satisfied			2
if they had their way , the @entity4 would have this demographic specific staff in all 50 states			0
and @entity105 believes this plan has already been a success , pointing to the fact that gov. @entity109 of @entity110 won 50 % of the @entity50 vote on the way to his reelection in 2013			0
@entity105 , who came to the @entity4 after running similar outreach programs in the @entity114 @entity20 , said the results were particularly stark in heavily @entity50 @entity116 , @entity110 , a county @entity109 turned red in 2013			1
" this is a permanent , year round effort , " @entity105 said			0
" we will be in these communities to not only ask for their vote , but to build relationships and listen to their concerns			0
" but not all recommendations outlined in the report have been followed			0
on the top of that list : the report 's suggestion that @entity25 should " embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform			1
" " if we do not , our party 's appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only , " wrote the five @entity4 authors of the report , which also stated that the @entity4 believes " comprehensive immigration reform " is " consistent " with @entity4 policies to " promote job growth and opportunity for all			1
" after passing the @entity55 , immigration reform has stalled in the @entity4 controlled @entity20			1
what 's more , @entity4 's who supported the measure - like @entity143 sen. @entity142 - have taken a beating with the party 's base for that support			2
@entity149 : @entity150 will compromise on immigration reform the other much talked about suggestion , that @entity25 need to alter their tone when talking about certain issues , has proven hard to change			1
" it 's not just what we say ; it 's how we say it , " @entity3 said when the report was published			1
but a number of high profile comments have undermined the @entity29 effort			0
examples : when rep. @entity166 of @entity167 told @entity168 that @entity170 immigrants have " calves the size of cantaloupes because they 're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert " or when rep. @entity176 of @entity177 said " the incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low			0
" @entity3 , who has called out some of the more outlandish comments , seems to just shrug this off with the fact that the @entity4 has only been at this for less than a year			1
" this idea that somehow the committee itself is taking on the entire world upon its shoulders and has to carpet the world " is not realistic , @entity185 told @entity0 on wednesday , the first day of the meeting			0
" in one year , is the world carpeted ? no. but we are making fundamental changes at a historic level that no one can deny			0
" @entity198 have watched this rebranding with amusement			0
every time someone like @entity166 makes an eye - popping statement or when the @entity4 , like it is doing this week , considers a resolution that encourages candidates to be more vocal on the anti-abortion stance , @entity198 have questioned the validity of the plan			0
in an e-mail on tuesday , @entity209 , spokeswoman for @entity210 , a liberal woman 's group , said the @entity4 abortion proposal shows the party is " misfiring on that rebrand " and " republicans are yet again focusing on rhetoric over reason			2
" " this is yet another example of the @entity25 being tone - deaf to @entity222 voters and trying to solve a policy problem with a fake , pr solution , " @entity209 wrote			0
" maybe , in 2014 , they should be taking a stronger look at the policies that women and their families actually want , and not how much or how little to talk to them about the ones they do n't			0
" @entity3 , quite expectedly , does n't see it that way			2
instead of saying the resolution pushes @entity25 to talk about their pro-life stances , the chairman said the idea is that " the point of the resolution is do n't stand there like s sitting duck , like a fool , and get punched in the face " when @entity198 challenge @entity4 on abortion			2
while tone and demographic outreach have been the most talked about aspects of the @entity4 changes , the committee has also tried to shore up other deficiencies that hurt them in 2012			1
@entity253 , the @entity4 's spokeswoman , said the party has " fundamentally reshaped our ground game structure to be community - based and bottom up , " is " closing the digital divide with a multi-million dollar investment in technology " and has " united behind the need for changes in the debate system			2
" the debate system as been an important , albeit quiet , focus of the @entity4 after the 2012 loss			2
for much of 2013 , a handful of party officials pushed batch rules aimed at streamlining a chaotic presidential nominating process that many party insiders viewed as damaging to the their campaign for the @entity20 in 2012			0
those rules are to be considered and voted on at this week 's @entity4 meeting			2
" i do n't think we need a six - month slice and dice festival on our party , " @entity3 said			2
" i think we need some compression on both ends to shorten the time period of the primary			0
and like i said , look i ca n't always control people 's mouths but we can have some control over how long we have to kill each other			0
" as for more comments that strike a tone the @entity4 would rather not take , most @entity29 committee members in @entity37 for the winter meeting know they are inevitable			1
" we wrote a report and certainly we advocated people being smart about what they say , but we do n't have a magic wand , " said @entity4 committeeman @entity291			1
" i think that is where we have to keep fighting that fight			0
we have to keep educating our members , or governors , as well as our candidates , to think about what you say and how you say it			0
" his advice to members who have a penchant for strong statements : " speak in a way that unites people and is not shrill			0

after losses in 2012 , @entity4 chair @entity3 ordered a review of the @entity29 at the national level
in 2013 , the @entity4 released a report titled the " @entity29 "
nearly a year after the report 's release , the @entity29 has *increased* minority outreach efforts
but it has n't embraced immigration reform and is struggling with *messaging* directed at women voters
