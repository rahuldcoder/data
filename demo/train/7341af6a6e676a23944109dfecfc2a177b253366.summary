-- as a federal air marshal , @entity1 typically spent five days a week crisscrossing the country on commercial flights , reading a lot of newspapers and @entity8 novels while keeping an eye out and trying to appear inconspicuous			1
" it was a well - paying job with enormous responsibility , yet extremely tedious and mundane , " he said			2
" you did the same thing every day , there was nothing new			0
you sat in your seat and prayed that nobody would set off an ied or ambush you mid-flight			0
" armed with service weapons and usually traveling in pairs , federal air marshals are tasked with detecting , deterring and defeating " hostile acts targeting @entity24 air carriers , airports , passengers , and crews , " according to the @entity29 's web site			1
if the air marshals are doing their job properly , the public does not learn about the incidents or potential catastrophes they 've prevented , @entity36 spokesman @entity35 said			1
" federal air marshals are trained to operate covertly and to blend in with the traveling public , " he said			1
" they work in the air and on the ground as a last line of defense , but if they 're doing the job right , you do n't know they 're there			2
" a federal air marshal was not on @entity50 when a passenger allegedly tried to detonate explosives hidden in his underwear			1
but the agency said the incident prompted it to enhance airport screening procedures and put more air marshals aboard flights			1
the @entity59 has been around in one form or another since the early 1960s , when a rash of hijackings of flights to @entity64 prompted president @entity65 to order that federal law enforcement officers be placed on high - risk flights			1
the @entity68 officially began in 1968 as the @entity69 's @entity68 , and in the 1970s , extortion - type hijackings in the @entity71 led to the deployment of some air marshals overseas			1
in 1985 , president @entity74 expanded the program , increasing the number of air marshals , in response to a series of domestic and international hijackings , including @entity81 , in which a @entity24 @entity82 was killed and his body dumped on the tarmac in @entity85 , @entity86			2
the terror attacks of september 11 , 2001 , represented a turning point in the agency 's history , when it grew from less than 50 officers to the several thousand currently employed as federal law enforcement officers in the @entity29 , @entity35 said			1
law enforcement officers and military personnel made up most of the first recruits to join the agency 's replenished ranks in october 2001 , said @entity99 , a former federal air marshal instructor and current ceo of @entity101 , a global security firm			1
recruits are trained extensively in tactical operations and law enforcement procedure			2
" they go through how to go hands - on with somebody in the tight confines of an aircraft , from how to disable an attacker from a seated position , how to fight if you fall down in the aisle , or how to use different items onboard to subdue and restrain attackers , " he said			0
" they learn how to restrain them using seatbelts -- basically fold the person over and strap them down			0
" trainees also learn the rules of engagement , laws related to use of force on airplanes and how to look out for suspicious behavior , or behavioral profiling			0
" we 'd teach them to look for mannerisms : specific styles of dress , whether they 're with a group or trying to peel off from a group , or if a uniformed officer approaches and they shy away -- things like that			2
we 'd teach them what to look for , " he said			0
applicants with backgrounds in law enforcement and the military are given special preference , but the positions are open to anyone with a college degree or three years of professional experience who proves up to the job , @entity35 said			1
" our training program is very comprehensive			0
we have people applying now with limited law enforcement experience and we provide them with the training to get them up to speed with what we expect of a federal air marshal , " he said			1
" @entity162 are supposed to look like the rest of the traveling public so it only stands to reason we would want recruits from all walks of life			0
" in the eight years since the @entity68 has been ramping up , only a handful of incidents have been publicly reported , most involving drunk or unruly passengers			0
@entity1 says he never had to make an arrest in five years flying missions as an air marshal			0
yet his career ended in controversy , when he was fired for leaking information on cutbacks in the program			0
did he ever secretly wish for some action to break up the tedium ? " no way , " he said , laughing			0
" not when you 're 35,000 feet up in the air flying at 500 mph in an aluminum tube with a few hundred people			2
you really do n't want anything to happen			0

federal air marshals spend a lot of time on commercial flights reading , staying inconspicuous
if they 're doing their job right , passengers should not notice air marshals aboard flight
*concept* of air marshals *originates* in early 1960s , when rash of flights to @entity64 hijacked
background in law enforcement not required but preferred
