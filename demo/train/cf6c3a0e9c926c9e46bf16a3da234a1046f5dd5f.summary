@entity0 -- @entity3 , @entity4 's largest bank by market capitalization , will lay off 14,000 employees around the world to save $ 2 billion to $ 3 billion by 2016 , the company announced wednesday			1
the layoffs -- representing more than 5 % of its 254,000 workers worldwide -- will come on top of some 42,000 job cuts in the past two years as the bank has sought to reorganize its operations to increase profits and efficiency in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis			2
" @entity3 in my view is terribly bloated , " says @entity19 , managing director of @entity20 in @entity0			1
" if you compare them to @entity23 , @entity24 , a lot of the @entity27 banks who did their layoffs closer to 2008 , @entity3 is just an anomaly			2
the number of staff is just incredible			2
" that realignment could see redundancies in @entity3 's non-core markets -- " probably @entity4 and @entity36 " -- while @entity37 will continue to be " a growth market , " predicts @entity39 , managing director of executive search firm @entity40			1
an @entity3 spokesperson said " all geographies and business will be reviewed but there are no specific details			2
" this week 's layoff announcement had been widely expected			0
in march , @entity3 's ceo @entity47 had said he would " fixate on costs " in 2013			2
" they 're still not finished with redundancies , " cautioned @entity49			0
" they are still restructuring , " but @entity3 's need to still lay off workers " is probably the exception " than the rule when comparing it to other global banks , says @entity54 of @entity20			1
" it very much depends on the institution and what lines of business they are in			0
@entity27 firms have really tried to cut to the bone			0
they might exit some businesses and then you would see redundancies ... ( like in ) mergers and acquisitions and investment banking			1
" @entity39 believes other major banking corporations need to follow @entity3 's streamlining			1
" ( @entity77 - based ) @entity75 and @entity76 could do with that sort of realignment , " says @entity39			0
" business banking -- they 're very good at that			0
they should be focused on that			0
the same for ( @entity0 - headquartered ) @entity84			0
@entity24 has got to ask itself ' what is our core business ' and ' do we give up on wealth management '			1
" similar questions exist for larger global banks including @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 , adds @entity39			0
looking ahead , analysts agree that job loss will occur at differing speeds depending on the sector			0
" we are seeing an increase in wealth management ( jobs ) , an increase in risk management compliance that deals with regulatory aspects , " says @entity39			1
" we 're seeing a dropoff ( in jobs ) of cash equity sales and structured product demand and a big drop in investment banking in @entity37 .			1
