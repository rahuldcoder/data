@entity0 -- @entity3 's judge apparently is so pleased with how well the actress is complying with her probation requirements in the past six weeks that she 's giving her more freedom to travel			1
" ms. @entity3 , you 've actually done well and done it not only on time but early , " @entity9 judge @entity8 said during a five - minute - long hearing wednesday			2
@entity3 worked 12 days at the county morgue and took part in five psychotherapy sessions over the past month as ordered , @entity8 said			1
" the morgue seems to be pleased , as pleased as a morgue can be , " @entity8 said			0
the judge offered an incentive for @entity3 to finish her monthly community service work early : she can travel freely around the @entity22 after she completes her required 12 morgue shifts between court dates			1
if @entity3 keeps up her compliance and completes 41 more days at the morgue -- 12 shifts each month -- and four sessions with a psychologist per month , the actress will have her supervised probation eased at the end of march			1
if she fails , she will serve an additional 270 days behind bars , the judge warned her last month			0
" this is what we really call putting the keys to the jail in the defendant 's hands , " @entity8 told @entity3			2
@entity3 was found in violation of her probation last month when she admitted that she failed to comply with @entity8 's earlier order that she work at a women 's shelter			1
her punishment -- a 30 - day jail sentence -- translated into just a few hours behind bars because of measures to reduce overcrowding in @entity52 jails			0
the atmosphere at wednesday 's status hearing was much lighter than in any previous appearances before @entity8			0
when @entity3 's attorney , @entity56 , asked the judge if @entity3 was required to be in court january 17 for the next status hearing , @entity8 said , " if i say no , she wo n't complete everything			1
" the judge 's next comment made @entity3 lower her face into her hands , laughing			1
" i think she likes to come here and see me , " @entity8 said			0
" i think that 's a motivation for her			0
" the judge said @entity3 's trip to @entity72 over the past week was approved by her probation officer because of " some confusion " about her travel restrictions			1
she is permitted to travel outside @entity76 only for holidays and work , she said			0
" she thought your sister 's birthday was a holiday and said she could go to @entity72 , " @entity8 said			0

@entity3 was already on probation for two drunken driving convictions from 2007			2
" from what i see of you , you need a structure , " @entity8 told @entity3 last month , instructing her to return to court each month to show she is complying with the schedule			2
@entity3 's legal woes , which began four years ago with two drunken driving arrests , have been compounded by her failure to attend counseling classes and alcohol and drug test failures			1
her probation is scheduled to end within a year unless @entity3 breaks any laws before then			0
it has been extended several times because of violations , including the failed alcohol and drug tests			0
