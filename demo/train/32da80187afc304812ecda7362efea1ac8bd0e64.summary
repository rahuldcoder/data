established in 2007 following the @entity4 siege , the @entity0 , or @entity2 @entity1 , is now a prominent actor in that country 's politics			1
it is a diverse umbrella group uniting some 30 militant groups across the @entity10 and other tribal areas bordering @entity12			1
it is estimated that there are some 30,000 @entity0 operatives			2
each of these groups aims to establish local spheres of @entity20 law , impose a particular restrictive vision of @entity23 living , and resist federal governance in the region			2
they also collectively condemn @entity2 support for the @entity27 in the " war against terror			1
" it is worth remembering that the @entity0 movement initially enjoyed some local support in the region before their violent methods began to alienate the population			1
in @entity35 , the @entity0 targeted landowners and gave local peasants greater access to vacated land and gemstones mines , which , through profit - sharing agreements , also afforded the movement a new revenue stream			1
the @entity0 message of religiously derived , quickly administered justice independent of the slow and arguably corrupt court system seemed to resonate with locals			2
however @entity0 violence over the years should not be underestimated			1
a report by the @entity50 reveals that last year in the @entity52 alone 476 attacks were carried out by the @entity0 and associated groups , leaving 572 civilians dead ( along with 115 security personnel ) and injured another 1,529 ( including 216 security personnel )			2
the majority of those affected are the civilian poor			0
some have criticised @entity2 for not addressing the @entity0 and other militant groups sooner , or not taking the threat they pose seriously enough			1
@entity64 ' tourist resort ' the delay by the military and police in tackling these groups was because they were not considered a substantive threat to the @entity2 state as a whole -- little is considered as great a threat to the existence of @entity2 as @entity75 and militants have been used as " proxy warriors " in that fight			2
@entity2 novelist @entity79 said the practice has turned the country into " an international jihadi tourist resort			0
" rather they were seen as misguided individuals dedicated to helping the good cause in @entity12 or dismissed as a local rebellion			2
nevertheless since 2009 , there have been annual military offensives against the @entity0 and affiliates , leading to thousands of internally displaced people , collateral damage and a few militant deaths			0
this year , the @entity2 state relied more on airstrikes than in previous years , leading to claims of higher than ever civilian casualty rates , but also greater the usual number of @entity0 combatant deaths			1
following these operations , the @entity0 have been widely predicted to fall : military jets had successfully bombed @entity0 hideouts , doctrinal splits over " non-islamic practices " seemed to paralyze them , in september parts of the @entity0 had announced a ceasefire and renounced violence , and a high turnover of leadership positions ( the current spokesperson only being in place for a few weeks ) leading to uncertainty among @entity0 foot soldiers and rumors of desertion			1
another revenge attack tuesday 's school attack can be seen as another act of revenge , as the @entity0 spokesman said : " we selected the army 's school for the attack because the government is targeting our families and females ... we want them to feel the pain			0
" thus @entity0 violence can not be divorced from the violence carried out by the state and state agencies in @entity2 against civilians in countless military operations , through police brutality , curfews , drone strikes and extrajudicial " disappearances			1
" we should not be surprised by the spike in violence now			0
as is typical of splintering militant groups and of those facing increased external pressure , the frequency , scale , and scope , of @entity0 violence has increased as the new leadership seeks to assert its authority and demonstrate strength to external audiences			1
the dramatic attack on the military school this december follows on the attack in the summer on @entity154 airport , the bombing of a flag ceremony on the border with @entity75 , and in 2013 they carried out a daring jailbreak in @entity160 , resulting in 35 " high value " militants escaping ( along with 240 other prisoners )			0
the group also , infamously , targeted the @entity166 winner @entity165 , who had campaigned for girls education in @entity2			0
schools , especially girls ' schools , are a frequent target of the @entity0			0
the targeting of a school this week -- especially one where most of the students are children of military personnel -- is not just about gaining shock and awe but a continuation of its campaign to violently target those who challenge its moral order			0
more than a thousand schools have been destroyed by @entity186 militants from one faction or another in the province of @entity189 in the past five years			0
schools symbolize government authority and are seen as un-islamic			0
pure @entity23 order the @entity0 -- convinced of the possibility of a pure perfect @entity23 order -- seeks to exclude from public politics and from the public spaces those that are " unperfectable : " women , homosexuals and the unrighteous who support infidels			1
the @entity0 target public spaces that distract from their vision of the perfect life : shrines , barber shops , eid prayer congregations , market squares , music shops , political rallies , and schools			2
this attack near @entity214 is a reminder that the military , and wider @entity2 , are not exempt from this desired order			0
therefore revenge and demonstrations of strength are only a partial explanation of this attack			0
it also reflects their broader aim to confine politics to a restricted group of people ( " righteous males " ) , a limited range of activities ( excluding fine arts and public expressions of merriment ) , and a severely constrained public space			0
@entity2 is a resilient country , surviving one crisis after another			0
it is culturally rich , with a vibrant tradition of public politics and plurality			1
from the kite flying festival to eid prayer congregations , from dancing girls to worship at @entity248 , @entity2 's expressions of joy and togetherness are excellent enactments of @entity2			0
the best antidote to the @entity0 would be to embrace this side of @entity2			1
if people hide behind closed doors , remain uneducated , the @entity0 's ideal of a restricted politics and an empty public sphere will become reality .			1

@entity1 condemn @entity2 support for the @entity27
@entity0 movement initially enjoyed some local support in restive region bordering @entity12
@entity1 violence has increased as the new leadership seeks to assert its authority
@entity2 must defend its vibrant tradition of public politics and plurality , says *analyst*
