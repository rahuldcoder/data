@entity4 linebacker @entity3 , 25 , shot to death the mother of his child , and then shot himself in the head in the middle of the afternoon saturday outside the team 's @entity11 practice facility			1
the day before , a man killed his father 's live - in girlfriend and then burst into a @entity18 college classroom where his father taught and killed him , police said			1
the man then ended his own life			0
experts who spoke with @entity0 say there are about 1,500 murder - suicide incidents in the @entity24 every year			1
in comparison , there were 14,612 murders in 2011 , the @entity28 says , and 38,364 suicides in 2010 , according to the @entity30			2
the 1,500 figure is questionable , experts caution , because there are no official statistics on this kind of crime -- the @entity28 does n't keep track , and police classify murders in different ways			1
this lack of certainty often amplifies the frustration people feel when loved ones are wrenched from them so violently			2
and it makes it even tougher to understand when the violence is wrought in public			0
here 's what we know from research about murder - suicides : -- fathers who kill their children , then themselves , are usually older than the mothers			1
-- older couples in murder - suicides are more likely to have medical illnesses			1
-- older men are more likely to kill themselves			0
-- younger couples are more likely to have a history of verbal discord			0
-- firearms are the favored weapon			0
-- victims are overwhelmingly female			0
-- estrangement is typically the biggest contributing factor			0
leaving the living to question everything fourteen years ago , @entity71 's brother was estranged from his former fiancee			1
the couple had trouble conceiving and were seeking fertility treatments			0
she had a relationship with another person and became pregnant , @entity71 told @entity0 , and her brother was incensed			2
fueled by alcohol , the brother killed the ex-fiancee and then himself			1
" my brother was never violent or abusive a day in his life , " she said			2
" nobody ever expected this			0
my brother was the kid next door			2
i have spent years trying to understand			0
" @entity71 and her mother formed the @entity89 in @entity90 specifically for family members of people who had committed murder - suicides			1
" i feel like there 's nobody who is telling their story , " she said			2
" i feel like all you do is struggling , and you go back and you go back , and what could we have seen or done ? the living are faced with what is left			0
" you are called ' murderer 's family			1
it can be very hard			0
" on top of the pain of that , she must also grieve the loss of her brother , whom she loved very much			2
" it 's been 14 years , and i still cry for what he did , " she said			2
" my mom gets calls all the time from people who 've had a murder - suicide in their family			1
they ask her , ' how do you continue to live ? ' " it took @entity71 's mother several years to decide she wanted to live because she felt so guilty for what her son had done			2
they lost family and friends because , @entity71 said , " they just could n't deal with it , or could n't handle watching her cry			2
" " we feel anger , too			0
we feel so much , " she added			0
" so all we can do is tell our story , and keep telling it			0
" raising alarms each story is different			0
but mental health professionals believe there are generally two types of people whose behavior could set off alarm bells as possible attackers			2
one is a " middle - aged man who is recently separated or facing pending estrangement from an intimate partner and who is depressed and has access to firearms , " writes dr. @entity152			2
" the other is an " an older male who is the primary caregiver for a spouse who is ill or debilitated , where there is a recent onset of new illness in the male , depression and access to firearms			0
" that 's according to a study @entity152 published in the @entity165			2
related : manhood , football and suicide sometimes , people want to kill themselves because they perceive someone has stopped loving them			1
the person who is perceived as withholding affection becomes a target			0
" a person who is miserable about the loss of affection in their life achieves compatibility again with this person by execution , " said dr. @entity174 , the executive director of the @entity175 in @entity176			0
he 's been studying suicide for more than two decades and travels around the world to investigate suicide scenes			1
" when one commits murder - suicide , they create acceptable consequences to them -- they are now with that person in a way they can control , " @entity174 said			1
related : @entity195 play on why some kill in public because murder - suicide statistics are n't readily available , it 's not possible to be sure how many happen in public spaces , like in @entity11 and @entity18			1
but choosing a public space , or at least doing it in front of other people , is a way to make a " major statement , " said dr. @entity206 , a professor in the @entity207 at @entity208 in @entity209			0
" often these are impulsive acts , too , " she said			0
" there 's just no way to know what was going through someone 's head			0
" public murder - suicide can be an act of communication , @entity174 said			1
it 's a way of acting out frustration and pain that can not be conveyed in another way			0
and though it 's typically between two people who know each other , the label murder - suicide includes mass killings , after which the killer or killers end their lives			1
experts mention infamous @entity234 killers @entity232 and @entity232 ; or @entity235 , the college student who killed 32 others before taking his life at @entity238 in 2007			1
there 's a lot of looking in the rear - view mirror , too			1
the spider web of people who are affected by a murder - suicide -- friends , family , even the community that sees it in the news -- are burdened to look for hints they might have missed			1
so know this : sometimes , people contemplating suicide warn us , said dr. @entity256 , a @entity0 contributor and an associate professor of psychiatry at the @entity260			1
" people who kill themselves often will tell someone ahead of time , " he wrote for @entity0 after the suicide of filmmaker @entity262			1
" any such communications should be taken with utmost seriousness , and all efforts should be made to keep the person safe and get him or her to appropriate treatment immediately			0
" nearly every person affected by a murder - suicide anguishes over what they might have missed to prevent it or get someone help , @entity174 said			1
@entity278 , @entity3 's agent , had trouble finding words to express his feelings			1
" you just ... the how and the why ... is the craziness of this , " he said			0
" there was nothing in my relationship with him that would indicate any troubling past , anything that troubled him ... " " maybe he knew he had to take his own life after what he had done , " the agent wondered			1
" we 'll never know , unfortunately			0
