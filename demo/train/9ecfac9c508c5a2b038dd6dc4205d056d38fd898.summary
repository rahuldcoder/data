an old wooden shack and rows of tilted fence posts : in a way , this deserted little patch of @entity5 dirt was the starting point for every airport in the world			1
on a cold winter 's day i scan a snowy , lonely field north of @entity12 , @entity13			1
not sure exactly where i am , i wonder for a minute if i 'm lost			0
a @entity15 sign makes it clear what i 'm looking at : " the first airport			1
i do n't think i knew about that			0
like millions of other @entity20 , i was taught that the @entity21 worked their flying magic in a place called @entity24 , @entity25			1
then it hit me : what i 'd stumbled onto was the @entity29 ' outdoor laboratory -- where they took powered flight to the next level			1
this 84 - acre pasture is where mrs. @entity35 's boys let themselves screw up			2
by learning from each misstep , they were able to develop " a practical and usable machine , " said park ranger @entity40			0
" this is the @entity42 , " he said			0
" this is literally where aviation gets its start			2
" related : were the @entity21 really first ? after the brothers made history at @entity24 , they schlepped more than 600 miles back to @entity12 with a contraption that could fly 852 feet in 59 seconds			1
that was cool and all â€” but folks were wondering : could an improved aircraft do more ? could it transport people from city to city ? maybe			0
could it help defend democracy in a world war ? perhaps			0
the brothers and their employees had their work cut out for them			0
between 1904 and 1916 , according to @entity40 and the @entity15 , a series of aviation firsts took place at @entity18 : -- first controlled turn -- first circle -- first controlled bank -- first figure - eight -- the " world 's first permanent flight school , " was established here , said @entity40			1
-- among the first students was @entity71 , who would become the only five - star general in the history of the @entity74			0
-- another student was @entity76 -- who in 1911 became the first pilot to fly coast to coast			0
-- the first " cargo flight , " took place out of @entity18 , said @entity40			1
as publicity for a retail shop , a @entity82 aircraft flew several bolts of cloth to @entity87 , about 55 miles away			0
" so , yeah , " @entity40 said			0
" it is the world 's first airport			1
other experts are n't so sure about that word , " airport			2
" " that 's not really an airport , " said historian @entity94 , curator of @entity95 at the @entity96			1
" an airport has to do two things : get airplanes in and out of the sky safely and it has to transfer people and goods from one mode of transportation to another			2
if you 're not doing those things , then i 'd say you 're not really an airport			2
" no other place , as far as i can tell , calls itself the " first airport			1
" @entity114 , a tiny facility outside @entity115 , has a good shot at the claim , said @entity118			1
however , it avoids the controversy by simply calling itself the " oldest continually operating airport in the world			1
" " if someone says ' first airport in @entity20 , ' you could argue @entity24 , " said @entity124 , program coordinator at the @entity125			1
" but we 've been flying here since 1909 and that 's our distinction			2
" related story : were the @entity21 really first ? another airport , @entity134 , which serves southwestern @entity135 , says it started four years before @entity114 , in 1905 , as a landing facility for a blimp			1
but its website calls it " one of the oldest operating fields in the @entity20 " the actual word " airport " was n't used until 1919 , when a newspaper coined it to describe @entity146 , @entity148 's @entity147 , which opened in 1910			1
now closed , @entity149 was " the first municipal airport in the @entity20 for both land and seaplanes , " according to the @entity150			2
" for academic historians , we find that ' firsts ' are really , really hard to establish , " @entity118 says with a laugh			2
" they 're hard to know			0
" related : @entity160 's most terrifying airport whatever the case , by the end of the first decade of the 20th century , @entity20 needed more landing and takeoff locations to support @entity20 air mail deliveries			1
that spurred the creation of airfields in @entity169 and @entity170			0
across the @entity146 , @entity172 aviators were establishing prototype airports , too			2
spurred by @entity175 , cities there eventually established @entity177 's @entity176 , @entity179 's @entity178 and @entity180 in @entity181			2
back in @entity13 , the @entity29 faced a few surprising challenges			1
the landowner allowed the @entity29 to use the field under the condition that they moved the horses and cows out of the way first , said @entity40			1
" sometimes there were issues			0
" another problem : how to get airborne			0
the plane 's engines were n't much more powerful than engines for riding lawn mowers			2
nature was n't always cooperative either			0
@entity13 winds are n't quite as gusty as the beaches of @entity24			1
solution : use a catapult			0
here 's how it worked : the plane sat at one end of a 240 - foot - long wooden rail atop a wheeled trolley			2
ropes and pulleys connected the trolley to a 1,600 - pound weight suspended from a 20 - foot - tall wooden derrick			0
with the plane 's engines revving , the weight was dropped , propelling the craft down the rail and -- one hoped -- into the air			0
" this becomes the forerunner of catapult systems used to launch planes from aircraft carriers today , " @entity40 said			0
a replica of the catapult derrick stands at the site , along with a replica of the @entity29 ' hangar , built on the exact spot of the original			1
because @entity18 is part of @entity228 , it has remained virtually untouched by real estate development , said @entity231 history professor @entity230 , who researched and wrote a paper on the property for the park service			1
( @entity235 ) " you can really get a sense of what it was like for the @entity21 to work there , " she said			0
" you can think about what they accomplished at that place , and really feel a connection to it			0
" the field is among five @entity12 - area sites that make up the @entity248 , including the @entity82 family mansion and one of the @entity29 ' bicycle shops			1
eventually , @entity18 was swallowed up by two nearby military installations : @entity228 and @entity253			1
later , the two merging facilities became @entity228 , which has contributed to research and development of groundbreaking advances , including pressurized plane cabins , cockpit navigation instruments and night - vision technology			0
amazing to think that it all sprouted from the exploits of two brothers , their bicycle shop and this hallowed piece of farmland .			0

most know about @entity24 , but the @entity29 *perfected* their planes in @entity13
@entity15 touts @entity18 as the " first airport "
many historic aviation firsts took place at @entity18 , located north of @entity12
oldest airports include @entity276 's @entity114 , @entity134 in @entity135
