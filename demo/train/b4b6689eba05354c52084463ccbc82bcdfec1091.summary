-- in @entity2 , @entity1 , a 16 - year - old movie buff , is wide awake by 7 a.m. to cook breakfast for his younger siblings			1
@entity5 and @entity6 started @entity7 of the @entity8 , or battle dress uniforms			1
in @entity11 , @entity10 , a 14 - year old novice guitarist , prepares ice packs for his mother whenever her chronic lower back pain kicks in			2
in @entity15 , @entity6 , an avid 17 - year old rock climber , disciplines her little sisters when they act out			1
@entity1 , @entity10 and @entity6 are three teenagers from across the country who have very different interests , but one experience that bonds them : they grew up fast -- sometimes too quickly -- to fill the shoes of mom or dad when their parent was shipped off to wars in @entity27 and @entity28			1
as the death toll from the two wars has risen over the last eight years , the fight has also affected a growing number of children left at home to cope without a parent			1
whether it 's raising their siblings or getting an after - school job , teens with parents in the military feel pressure to step up			1
" these teens are expected to take on the responsibility the deployed parent used to take care of , " said @entity43 , director of programs for @entity44 , a nonprofit organization that provides support to children with a deployed parent in the @entity49			1
" there 's usually the expectation that they will pitch in and help out more			2
" more than 30,000 teens between 12 and 18 have at least one parent in the @entity49 deployed to @entity27 or @entity28 , according to the @entity59			1
when all military branches are taken into consideration , the @entity60 estimates about 700,000 children under the age of 18 have a parent deployed overseas for military duty			1
playing mom and dad " this is nothing , " said @entity1 modestly , describing his daily task of taking his 9 - year - old sister @entity69 to ballet and violin lessons and being a crying shoulder for his 13 - year - old brother , @entity72 , when he misses dad			1
" it 's a lot of responsibility , but i do n't really have a choice			2
my dad told me i am the man of the house , and i have to act like it , " he said			1
last december , @entity1 's father , @entity81 , was called to serve in @entity27			1
the family had a tearful goodbye at the @entity84 , his father 's favorite restaurant			0
@entity1 talks to his father by phone , from once a week to several times , updating him on how the rest of the family is doing			1
if military teens adjust well to deployment , they can be more adaptive and resilient than their peers , said @entity96 , associate professor of human development at @entity97 the wars have changed the military course for @entity49 members , many who joined under the slogan " one weekend a month , two weeks a year			1
" guard member families say they anticipated their loved one would be gone occasionally to help with domestic disasters , but not to an international war that has lasted this long			0
@entity107 members are serving for longer periods of time -- up to 15 months -- and sometimes have multiple deployments			1
" multiple deployments have multiple effects , " said @entity111 , chief of the service support division in the @entity113			2
" it 's not like this is a latchkey kid or a parent who is traveling on business			0
we may not know for a long time what kind of impact these deployments are having on our children			1
" fifteen - year - old @entity10 ' father was sent to @entity27 in 2007 for three months , and will leave again next month			0
while his father was gone , he learned to fix leaky plumbing in the house			2
he comforted his younger sister @entity129 when the family cat passed away , holding her hand all the way home from the vet			0
@entity10 says he missed hanging out with his father , joking around and playing @entity136 games together			0
" we chose the perspective that it 's our duty to share our daddy , " @entity10 's mom @entity137 said			0
" that feels much better than being sad all the time			0
but of course we miss him			0
" coping without a parent deployment can cause a child to become depressed angry and isolated , some studies show			0
last year , @entity59 documents showed a spike in the number of military children who have undergone out - patient counseling since 9/11			2
dealing with a parent 's absence is no easier for teenagers , who are already confronting the growing pains of adolescence			0
" all across the board , these kids are carrying an enormous burden , " explained @entity158 , who runs the youth initiative programs at the nonprofit @entity160			0
@entity164 of @entity165 , @entity166 , recalled going through trouble after her mother , a single parent , was deployed to @entity27 in 2007 for a year			2
@entity164 , 16 at the time , and her younger sister were sent to live with a family friend			2
@entity164 became reclusive and confused			0
it did n't help that the media was blitzed with images of war			0
just a few months after her mother left , she was arrested for shoplifting			0
" i pretty much realized i had to stop being a child , " said @entity164 , who has graduated from high school			0
when her mother was at war , she got a job at a deli , saving up money to get her own apartment and attend community college			0
" i ca n't just rely on my parents and i have to learn to do it myself			2
" @entity189 of the @entity8 having a parent in the @entity49 comes with its own challenges			1
@entity49 members live civilian lives , so their families are often geographically isolated from others like them -- but the children of career military members live near and attend school with other kids whose parents may be sent overseas			1
high school student @entity6 of @entity15 remembered being teased when she wore her father 's jacket to school after he was deployed to @entity28 in april 2007			2
jokingly , students without parents in the military asked her , " was your dad shot at ? " @entity6 felt alone , thinking no one could understand her , especially when her mother became depressed shortly after her father left			1
but @entity6 said she kept busy babysitting her sisters , 8 and 3 at the time			0
" i was emotional but i tried not to be in front of my sisters , " @entity6 said			0
this summer , while their friends were busy deciding what to wear to the pool , @entity6 and @entity5 , another 17 - year - old @entity15 teen with a father deployed to @entity28 with the @entity49 , created the @entity189 of the @entity8 , short for " battle dress uniform			1
" they 've planned a 2010 conference that will bring together 400 military girls from across the state to address the issues of being a military child			1
in organizing the conference , the two assumed responsibilities many college students have yet to experience : filling out tax exemption forms , developing a curriculum for participants , soliciting donations from major companies			2
" if you pass by us , we do n't really have a normal teenage conversation , " said @entity5 in a high - pitched bubbly voice			0
she 's been working on the project the entire summer			0
" we sound like 35 - year - old businessmen			0

children of parents deployed to wars overseas assume adult responsibilities
deployments cause stress but also force teens to become more resilient
" my dad told me i am the man of the house , and i have to act like it , " says @entity1 , 16
