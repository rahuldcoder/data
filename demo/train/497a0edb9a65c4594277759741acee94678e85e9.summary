editor 's note : @entity3 strategist @entity2 was a campaign consultant for @entity6 's presidential campaign and has worked on more than half a dozen presidential campaigns			1
@entity2 is a partner in @entity8 , a political and public affairs consulting firm that specializes in advertising			2
for a rival view , read here @entity2 says the @entity12 requires that votes be counted equally within a state			1
( @entity15 ) -- @entity17 are a peculiar breed , the stereotype goes			0
they are disproportionately well - mannered			0
when dinner is offered , @entity17 refuse at least three times before accepting			0
they habitually react to the most bone - chilling personal misfortune with a stoic , " could have been worse			0
" they speak an indirect idiom to avoid hurting another 's feelings			2
" so , what gave you the idea that we talk like that then ? " @entity17 eat lutefisk , not for its taste , but from a sense of cultural responsibility			0
after all , the delightful state staple is fish prepared in lye			0
who would want to miss " @entity38 " night ? " @entity42 , " however , can expose the soft underbelly of the state to self - interested politicians			0
this year , it may allow comedian @entity44 to walk away with one of the state 's highest public offices and the @entity48 might finally gain what it has always lacked : a clown who is a credentialed professional			1
even with @entity54 in disgrace and @entity56 suffering all - time - low approval ratings , a @entity48 seat still has value			0
ask @entity59 , the chief executive of @entity60 , a state whose lowest point , previously , was the @entity63			0
it is now his own governor 's office			0
if the @entity69 attorney 's charges are true , at least @entity59 had sufficient respect for a @entity48 seat to ask aspirants to pay for it			0
in @entity74 , @entity44 might pocket the @entity48 seat formerly held by @entity76 without paying a cent			1
as @entity79 , a professor of law at the @entity80 in @entity81 wrote in @entity82 , there is a lot in the recount affair to concern us			0
@entity44 has exploited a weakness in almost every state 's recount process			1
recounts , @entity79 observes , must not violate the 14th amendment , which provides that " no state shall ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws			1
" the @entity12 suggests it is a matter of some importance that votes be counted uniformly in a democracy			2
the @entity101 's " @entity100 " 2000 decision reaffirmed the equal protection clause : ballots in one precinct or county must not be evaluated differently than those in others			1
recounts , however , are conducted locally , with individual precincts and counties interpreting state election laws			0
the result in @entity74 is a crazy quilt of newly evolved standards that , in fact , have become no standards at all -- and are constitutionally unacceptable			1
all votes are meant to get equal protection in @entity74 , but @entity44 's votes are getting more equal protection than @entity76 's			1
in some parts of the state , as a @entity82 editorial observed , recount officials have accepted @entity119 tallied on election night , even when the physical ballots were nowhere to be found for the recount			0
let 's say , through error or design , some overly enthusiastic election night official fed @entity44 votes through a voting machine twice : in some parts of @entity74 , @entity44 kept those votes , even though they could not be re-tallied			1
in other jurisdictions , the election night tally was thrown out and @entity44 got to include votes he did n't have election night but his team subsequently discovered			1
availing himself of dissimilar standards in different parts of the state , @entity44 got to pick which benefited him the most , the election - day tally or the recount			1
in some localities , @entity44 's campaign has even been allowed to double - count ballots			1
if a legitimate ballot is damaged and can not be mechanically counted , @entity74 law allows election officials to create and count a duplicate , as long as the original is marked and both ballots are stapled together			1
the @entity82 contends that 80 to 100 original and duplicate ballots were separated and counted individually in the recount			2
even if this were @entity60 , such electoral imagineering is unlawful			0
has the @entity76 campaign allowed itself to be victimized ? perhaps			0
as @entity79 noted , the @entity162 's 3 - 2 decision allowed local boards to count absentee ballots that had been excluded , but only if both the @entity76 and @entity44 teams approved			1
" insiders agree that mr. @entity44 's team played a far more savvy game than mr. @entity76 's , " he wrote			1
" the margin of mr. @entity44 's current lead is partly the product of a successful what 's - mine - is - mine - what 's - yours - is - vetoed strategy , and of the @entity76 team 's failure to counter it , " @entity79 wrote			1
unfortunately for @entity44 , the equal protection clause is not concerned with the cleverest competitors or the most savvy strategy			1
the @entity12 is there to protect voters , not candidates , and it says all their votes must be valued identically			0
a recount is supposed to eliminate the political absurdities we find in @entity74			1
instead , @entity44 has exploited this recount to manufacture them			1
as a result , he has a lead -- and 25 precincts in @entity74 now have more ballots than voters			1
the good people of @entity74 need not worry , however			2
that oracle of objectivity , the selfless @entity198 leader of the @entity48 , has declared @entity44 the winner			2
there 's no need to see the process through , @entity200 said wednesday , because , " there is no way that @entity76 can win this			0
the numbers just are n't there			0
" @entity200 adds that " polls in @entity74 show that about half the people are upset ... at @entity76 asking for this additional work			2
" shame on @entity76 for insisting that every vote be counted , especially when those votes are his			2
in politics , much like football , both teams have to play by one set of rules			0
neither team is allowed to score points after the game is over and the other team has left the field			0
otherwise , the @entity225 could still go to the @entity226			0
with @entity44 's vote counters , @entity227 could still have been sworn in			1
there is good news for @entity76 , however : the @entity69 @entity12 is still law in @entity74			2
@entity74 courts will soon speak on the unequal evaluation of votes that has consistently advantaged @entity44			1
if state courts do not invalidate @entity44 's dodgy lead in a trial that started monday , it would not surprise if the @entity69 @entity101 finally did			1
@entity44 has tried to claim a hasty victory with more votes than voters			2
in so doing , he has shrugged aside the @entity12 and underestimated the people of @entity74			2
their civility is built upon steel - eyed character			0
they believe all votes and all voters should be treated equally			0
the nicest state in the union deserves nothing less			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity74 's recount violated equal protection clause
he says @entity44 benefited from differing standards in different localities
@entity2 : some votes were not counted , others may have been counted twice
he says trial that started monday could invalidate @entity44 's lead
