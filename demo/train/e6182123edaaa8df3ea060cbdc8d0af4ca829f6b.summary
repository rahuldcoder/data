-- construct a film that includes chiseled , handsome @entity3 actors like @entity4 and @entity5 portraying strippers , as is the case with friday 's " @entity8 , " and you can guess that veiled promise of nudity will draw some moviegoers			1
but add @entity13 to that mix , and the stakes are raised even higher			1
the 32 - year - old actor has steadily built a career over the past seven years , folding teen films , action flicks , comedies and romantic dramas into his filmography			2
yet this seems to be the year that @entity13 's success has reached a crescendo , the moment at which the actor is poised to reach a new level of stardom			1
" @entity8 , " directed by @entity34 and inspired by @entity13 's own brief stint as a stripper in his younger years , has caused a frenzy of anticipation , leading box office observers to expect this to be another solid turnout for the actor			1
if that happens , it will be just the latest in a string of successes for @entity13 , who had a strong showing with both february 's " @entity42 " and march 's " @entity43 , " says @entity44 , editor of @entity45			1
" i ca n't think of an actor who 's having a stronger year in terms of building their drawing power , " @entity44 says , estimating that " @entity8 " will pull in $ 29 million on opening weekend , taking second place behind " @entity50			1
" that would ride on the heels of the romantic drama " @entity42 , " which " turned him into kind of a more solidified romantic interest , " @entity44 says , and earned $ 194.6 million globally , as well as his comedic success with @entity58 , " @entity43 , " which earned $ 195.6 million worldwide			1
that movie not only had a solid box office run , but it also showed just how funny @entity13 can be			1
" he 's coming off these two very huge movies , and then you have [ ' @entity8 ' ]			1
it 's great timing , " @entity44 says			2
" not only can he be in a romantic role because women would love to be with him , but he can be in an action role because he fits that mold too			0
in terms of a box office draw , that 's a dangerous combination			2
" @entity3 has taken notice , says @entity74 ' @entity73 , who pegs @entity13 as one of the actors who has the most to gain or lose this summer			2
" when you talk to anybody in this town and you say , who 's the next big movie star , [ it 's ] @entity13 , @entity13 , @entity13 , " says @entity73			1
" he is the one that everybody has their eye on , everybody 's expecting to be a guy who can draw audiences , [ and ] who can draw a lot of money			2
" more specifically -- and most importantly -- he 's been able to draw profit			2
" he 's not just minting box office money -- lots of people can do that , " @entity73 says			2
" he 's making movies that are being made on a small budget that are just churning out the dollars			0
i think when you talk about this being a make or break moment for him , that 's apt. " yet @entity13 has n't gotten this far by being a repeat critical darling or a constant nominee at awards shows			1
instead , he 's used strategic film choices , an innate gift that lures in audiences and a reputation for a diligent work ethic to go from the fringes of the industry to high - profile features , such as his upcoming role in the @entity120 ' sci - fi film , " @entity121			0
" @entity122 , who directed @entity13 in his breakout lead role in 2006 's dance - centric movie " @entity125 , " says she knew instinctively that @entity13 was right for the part , however green he may have been at the time			1
" @entity13 and i are each other 's firsts -- first starring role , first directorial , " @entity128 says			1
" i think a lot of [ the casting ] was instinctual			0
... we auditioned him and he was fantastic			0
the thing about @entity13 was that a ) he could move , and b ) he had so much charisma			2
it just poured out of him ... and without question that would permeate on screen			0
" " @entity125 " went on to gross $ 114 million worldwide and spawn a franchise , with a fourth film arriving this summer , and it was also a stepping stone for @entity13 to show that he could dance as well as " hold the camera 's attention , " says @entity149 , senior film critic for the trade publication @entity150			1
" ' @entity125 ' sort of took @entity3 by surprise in terms of how popular it was , and i do n't think anyone would 've thought that would be the film that would launch an acting career , " @entity149 says			0
" especially because what he really brought to that were dance moves			0
" casting directors @entity161 and @entity163 , who have cast @entity13 in 2006 's " @entity164 , " 2009 's " fighting , " and this year 's " the vow , " say that the actor has been able to carve out a space for himself as an @entity171 guy 's guy who can show sensitivity			1
" the thing that i think @entity13 does so naturally and brilliantly is ... he has an innate honesty and charm that is just beguiling , " @entity161 says			2
" and i think it 's completely natural and i think it 's exactly actually who he is			0
i do n't think it 's about performance , i think it 's about something in his being that 's very honest			0
" @entity149 agrees , saying that while he does n't necessarily look to @entity187 for an exciting , groundbreaking performance , he also does n't overlook what the actor does well , which is " connecting directly with an audience			0
" " what he 's doing is low - key and very natural , " @entity149 says			0
" in some ways , it appears so effortless that there 's this sense that anyone could do it			0
and i think it 's really a mistake to dismiss it as being that simplistic			0
" @entity149 adds that @entity13 's performance in " @entity8 " is the kind where " critics can once again sharpen their knives when looking for the chance to break down his performance , but i think it 's a little bit more complicated , what he 's doing , " he says			1
" i do n't think he 's a great thespian , the kind of person who 's shown that he can deliver complexity , but there is a subtlety , a casualness that feels familiar and that feels like you can relate to the characters that he plays , that 's not accidental and is absolutely part of the performance			0
" thus far , though , critics seem to have fallen for @entity13 's particular brand of nonchalant charm in " @entity8			1
" observers are curious to see who turns out for the film , as well as how well it will perform			0
@entity73 , for one , predicts that even if " @entity8 " is a flop , it wo n't hurt @entity13 's trajectory			1
" there 's something about him that 's working right now , and @entity3 is rooting for him , [ and ] i think the audience is rooting for him , " she says			0
and if this movie is a hit , she adds , " it takes all these suspicions that @entity3 has about him as a leading man and shoots them through the roof			0

@entity13 has had a successful year with " @entity42 " and " @entity43 "
" @entity8 " is poised to help push his career to a new level
