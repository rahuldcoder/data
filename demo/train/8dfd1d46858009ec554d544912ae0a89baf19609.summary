-- @entity1 once told me something surprising about her famous partnership with dr. @entity5 , which helped revolutionize @entity9 's understanding of human sexuality			1
despite @entity15 and @entity1 's worldwide fame , " we were absolutely the two most secretive people on the face of the @entity13 , " she said			1
" there 's simply no one who knew us well			2
people have a lot of speculation , but they do n't know			0
" on thursday , as i read the obituaries about @entity1 's death at age 88 , i was reminded of @entity25 's words			1
there 's a sense of marvel about her life story and how she managed to affect the lives and happiness of so many people , especially independent - minded women like herself who wanted to make their own decisions about sex outside the dictates of men			1
@entity1 's life seems like a modern - day @entity41 story			1
down on her luck , a twice - divorced women and with two kids , she went back to @entity45 at age 32 looking for a degree			2
she was working as a secretary at the university - affiliated hospital in @entity51 when she met @entity5 , the top ob - gyn and fertility expert in town			2
a hard - driving , ambitious physician , @entity15 wanted very much to win a @entity55 for documenting clinically just how the human body responded during sex , so that medicine could come up with effective treatments for married couples having troubles in the bedroom			1
@entity63 realized he needed a female partner for such a risky venture			0
the few female doctors around in the 1950s did n't want to go near his potentially explosive experiment that could bring career ruin			0
not even @entity5 ' wife -- with two young children at home in the suburbs -- wanted to get involved			2
almost immediately she showed a native genius for what made men and women tick , sexually and in matters of the heart			0
first as a dutiful associate and eventually as the full - fledged partner to @entity15 , @entity1 convinced dozens of women and men -- nurses , residents , graduate students and various people around @entity51 -- to become part of their secretive decade - long study , the biggest sex experiment in @entity9 history			1
their work was published in 1966 in " @entity96 , " which outlined , in its own obtuse medicalese , just how the body worked during sex			0
like cartographers , they mapped how each body part vibrated , sweated and became aroused during lovemaking			0
without @entity1 's extraordinary zeal and persuasiveness , @entity5 conceded their study would have failed			1
to his everlasting credit , @entity63 gave " @entity110 " credit for her remarkable contributions , far more than any male doctor in the 1950s would have done , sharing his byline with her on their first book			0
@entity116 would underline @entity1 's impact even more			2
despite their guarded language , the first book documented the power of female sexuality , showing that women were capable of multiple orgasms -- a veritable fireworks display -- compared to most men 's single firecracker			1
their clinical evidence became part of the spark for @entity9 's so - called sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s , reflected in everything from key feminist writings to @entity136 's @entity135			0
even the rosy women 's magazines , filled with recipes and homey bromides , began writing about sex , using the same clinical phrases that @entity15 and @entity1 made acceptable in polite society			1
but @entity25 's impact became particularly evident in the duo 's second book , 1970 's " @entity151 , " which landed them on the cover of @entity149 and television talk shows			0
it was @entity25 who largely developed the team 's " sensate " therapy from a hodgepodge of influences -- including behaviorism , @entity160 talking methods and even urology studies from other medical researchers -- that soon had couples flocking to their clinic for a cure for their sexual difficulties			0
that a woman without a degree had come up with such an effective approach heralding a quintessentially @entity9 quick - fix -- an 80 % success rate within a mere two weeks ( as opposed to years on a @entity173 analysts ' couch talking about your feelings about poor old mother ! ) -- was galling to the medical establishment			0
yet @entity5 and @entity1 's pioneering work created the modern sex therapy industry , with clinics around the world relying on their methods and wisdom to this day			1
later in life , @entity25 would say her 24/7 devotion to her research and their patients hurt both her relationship with her children and her marriage with masters ( they divorced in the 1990s shortly before their clinic closed ) -- expressing this with the same regret some women today share in balancing work and family life			2
she was also concerned that their pioneering work on sex might be used by libertines to avoid the necessity of caring for their partners as real , loving human beings , rather than pornographic holograms in the bedroom			0
but mostly , @entity1 became aware that many younger women today had adopted her independent - mindedness about sex , once so verboten in 1950s @entity9			1
only they , and not some fatherly figure in a white lab coat , would rule their bodies and set the terms for when , how and with whom they would share themselves			0
@entity1 's remarkable personal and professional adventures make her one of the most extraordinary @entity9 women of the 20th century			1
her passing should remind us of just how great an impact her life had on all of us			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			2

@entity224 : @entity1 , who has died , helped women take control of their sexuality
from modest beginnings , she partnered with @entity5 on revolutionary sex research
she and @entity15 took on subjects not *discussed* , like women 's multiple orgasms
@entity224 : masters said their research depended on her ; she helped change the terms of sex
