-- the @entity2 administration likely will succumb to growing pressure to " do something " kinetic and dramatic in @entity5 , and when it does , it will most likely be air and missile strikes against @entity9 targets			1
this could relieve the political pressure on the president : his critics continue to blame him for abdicating @entity16 leadership in @entity17 and in @entity5 -- which now faces the advancing extremist militants of the @entity20 in @entity5 and @entity17 ( @entity9 )			1
but answering the political mail in @entity22 is not the same thing as dealing with , let alone resolving , the complex issues on the ground that have led to this crisis			0
to do that would require a comprehensive reengagement strategy , even without boots on the ground			0
and president @entity2 should not be drawn into a veritable @entity31 most of @entity2 's detractors engage in what i call " woulda / coulda / shoulda " criticism			2
that is to say , if the president had only invested more time and effort in negotiating a status of forces agreement with the government of prime minister @entity43 , left a residual presence there , enforced his chemical weapons red line in @entity17 and backed the moderate opposition there , we would n't be seeing the @entity9 jihadi rampage playing out in both countries			1
but given the limited amount of intervention this administration , @entity56 , and the public would support , even under the best of circumstances , the @entity16 could not have stopped the dynamic that is occurring			2
we can not hold @entity5 's hand forever , nor end @entity17 's civil war without a major military commitment			1
and the longer the @entity17 conflict continued , the more of a boon the conflict would provide to jihadi elements who fed off its violence and sectarian character			2
as for @entity5 , the @entity43 government 's insistence on maintaining @entity74 dominance and privilege , and repressing @entity76 , created the perfect ferment for @entity9 's spread			1
no amount of @entity16 military power summoned by any administration could have compensated for this kind of bad sectarian governance			1
that and the weak institutions of the @entity5 state have allowed @entity9 to thrive			1
no matter how much progress the @entity16 made in @entity5 between 2003 and 2011 , the dysfunction that now shapes @entity5 's future was driven by factors set into motion by the very act of the invasion , @entity5 's nature and its location			1
and those same factors limit now what the @entity16 can do ; they should make @entity22 wary of getting sucked back in			2
back to @entity5 : what can - and should - the @entity16 do now ? @entity43 's sectarian dominance how can you expect stability and security in a country where the political contract between the governed and those who govern is completely skewed in the direction of the @entity74 community ? but that 's what you have with @entity43 ; and that 's unlikely to change			1
@entity74 repression has left @entity76 feeling disenfranchised -- one reason why violence has surged in the last year -- and this is why it 's hard to get @entity76 elements of the military to fight and resist @entity9 moves			2
it 's also why some key @entity76 elements are reportedly in league with the @entity9 jihadis			2
it 's a reason to be careful about backing a government not committed to serious power sharing and reform , let alone to use direct @entity16 military intervention to defend it			0
the @entity16 could n't build the new @entity5 on the backs of @entity16 military power before it was clear that @entity43 was a @entity74 triumphalist			1
how are we to do it today when it 's clear that he is ? the neighbors geography is destiny			0
this is n't @entity16 's neighborhood : it does not have the same kind of stake as those who live there			0
the @entity16 may be committed to a nonsectarian , pluralist , democratic @entity5 where everybody gets along in one big happy family			1
but @entity144 and @entity145 envision very different outcomes , and they will act in ways detrimental to our interests			0
@entity144 is worried about @entity9 to be sure			0
but @entity144 knows that its long - term interests depend on a stable @entity5 under @entity74 dominance			2
that means that while it will assist @entity43 , it wo n't pressure him to reform			0
the @entity145 , on the other hand , ca n't abide @entity43 and while they are worried about the @entity76 jihadis , they see some merit in weakening the prime minister			0
both @entity159 and @entity160 will continue to see @entity5 as a battleground to check the other 's influence and to promote their side in a @entity74 war			0
@entity5 's stability and the @entity16 's altruistic vision of @entity5 's future will be the casualties			1
the @entity17 civil war any @entity16 strategy that deals with @entity5 in isolation will fail to get at a main sources of the @entity9 threat			1
the @entity17 civil war was a godsend for these jihadi groups			0
and unless the @entity16 is prepared to expand its area of operations and to develop a sustained , aggressive strategy to contain if not destroy the @entity9 presence in @entity17 , any effort in @entity5 will at best produce a short - term success			1
having willfully avoided militarizing the @entity16 role in @entity17 , the president may well go ahead and do so now , with all the risks of mission creep			1
attacking @entity9 will also help @entity187 in @entity17 and @entity144 in @entity5			1
a serious strategy and that brings us to the most difficult dimension of this entire problem			0
without a serious and sustained strategy that has a military , counterterrorism , political and economic component , including mobilizing the international community , it 's hard to see how the @entity2 administration can realistically put these @entity200 back together again			1
to do that would mean @entity16 involvement -- for starters @entity203 or special forces in an advisory capacity , most likely functioning clandestinely			0
airstrikes , even if they worked to check @entity9 , would have to be used repeatedly over time			0
and more training for the @entity5 military -- most likely with advisers on the ground to instruct in the use of sophisticated military equipment -- would be necessary			0
and despite all of this , it 's likely that @entity9 may still be able to secure enclaves in @entity5			1
have n't we seen this movie before ? it was called @entity5 2003 - 2011 , and it clearly did n't have a happy ending			2
so , mr. president , you probably have no other choice but to get sucked back into @entity5 with military strikes			0
it might even have positive short - term results			2
but it likely wo n't over time			0
@entity227 , unhappy @entity76 , @entity144 influence , and @entity230 separatists will guarantee it			0
@entity5 was a trap for @entity16 once before			2
5 predictions revisited : @entity5 's troubles are years in the making			0

*writer* : @entity2 administration will likely yield to pressure to act on @entity9 advances in @entity5
he says it should not . the @entity16 could not have *prevented* crisis . bad @entity5 governance was key
he says any success repelling @entity9 in @entity5 will be short - lived unless @entity16 also does so in @entity17
@entity16 would need sustained strategy if it is to address crisis . we *'ve* seen this movie before , he says
