down syndrome , with all its promise and challenges , has never been more visible : @entity4 , an actress with @entity1 , just walked the catwalk at @entity6			1
a video of a girl with @entity1 singing a @entity10 song went viral , receiving 6 million page views and counting			1
people were so moved by the story of a father choosing his son with @entity1 over his marriage that they donated over $ 500,000 to his care ( although the father 's story has now been called into question )			1
the @entity22 , on a regular basis , inspires its members with stories about accomplishments , loving families and overcoming challenges			2
i love these stories and they make me happy			2
somehow , though , their impact is limited			2
despite the good press and the outpouring of support , when one 's own child is diagnosed with @entity1 , far too many people react with a toxic combination of fear and terror			1
fortunately , there are antidotes : information , experts and community			1
thanks to the power of the @entity49 and the commitment of activists , politicians and experts of all sorts , access to these antidotes has never been easier			1
here 's an example of the power of sharing information : at about 7 a.m. one day last november , @entity58 sent me a @entity61 message about her best friend , @entity62			1
( all names have been altered			0
) @entity62 was pregnant with twins , one of whom had been diagnosed with both @entity1 and a heart defect			1
@entity62 and her spouse were stuck in that toxic panic and did n't know what to do			0
@entity58 wrote , " they told me it 's super easy to find adoptive parents because lots of people want kids with special needs			1
right now , their plan is to leave the baby at the hospital , and failing that the fire station			0
" i was startled by the message , but not shocked			0
i 'm the father of a boy with @entity1 and had at least an inkling of what @entity62 was going through			1
on the other hand , although safe haven laws make leaving a child at the hospital legal , and @entity93 children with @entity1 do often get adopted , this clearly was n't the right way to go about it			1
so i told @entity58 i 'd be back shortly to help , got my own children safely off on the bus to school , and returned to my computer 40 minutes later			0
soon , i was talking to @entity100 , the executive director of the @entity101			0
fifteen minutes later , @entity100 had connected me to @entity102 , the co-director of the @entity103			0
@entity102 reached out to @entity58 and from there to @entity62			0
over the next few weeks , @entity62 and her spouse started talking to potential adoptive parents , but also got plugged into all the resources for families of people with @entity1			1
eventually , as the hazy fear of diagnosis burned off , and thanks to the couple 's own desire to learn more , their perceptions changed			2
@entity62 has now given birth			0
one of her twins does indeed have @entity1			1
the new parents are keeping both children			0
today , in @entity58 's words , " they 're stressed out and scared but in love with their babies and looking forward to when the four can be home together			2
" @entity58 and i may be @entity61 friends , but we have never met and do n't really know each other			0
it 's amazing that this tenuous contact between us helped shift the outcome for @entity62 and her family			2
it points out a positive way in which the @entity49 has changed the experience of raising a child with special needs			1
the moment of diagnosis is terribly jarring , no matter when it takes place			0
it throws you from a world for which you thought you were preparing into some other strange place			0
while the circumstances of my son 's diagnosis were different than @entity62 's , the hours and days after were very difficult			2
in fact , i 've spoken to hundreds of parents about their experience , and we mostly all felt alone and afraid			0
in a previous era , @entity62 's story might have played out very differently			2
access to basic information about @entity1 was hard to come by , even from medical practitioners , and it was a challenge to make contact with experts and other parents			1
now , @entity62 and many like her can plug into a vibrant and informed community almost instantly			0
whether it 's parents of children with well - known disabilities , people dealing with rare diseases , or any other subset of humanity that has a hard time locating face - to - face community , it 's far easier to connect on the @entity49			1
social media provides a highly mediated and algorithmically - driven commercial environment that at best mirrors real relationships			0
it 's often criticized for destroying @entity93 family life			2
but i feel lucky to have these communication tools at my disposal , even if i 'm just sharing small struggles and tiny victories -- how to help with sleeping issues , the triumph of my son eating a scrambled egg for the first time in his life , or wondering how to make a haircut less traumatic for all involved			0
and sometimes , as with @entity62 , the stakes are much higher			0
these are the stories about @entity1 that do n't make news , and maybe that 's ok , so long as people know that these networks exist			1
there are thousands , maybe tens of thousands , of people with and without disabilities ready to respond not with fear or judgment , but with information and empathy .			1

@entity208 : when one 's own child is diagnosed with @entity1 , many people react with terror
thanks to the power of the @entity49 , access to information and support has never been easier
