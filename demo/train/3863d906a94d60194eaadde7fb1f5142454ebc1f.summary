not since @entity1 , an @entity2 convicted of murder and pardoned decades later , has @entity0 executed a woman			2
the state was scheduled to snap that 70 - year streak wednesday before @entity8 's execution was postponed			1
just hours before the 47 - year - old was scheduled to die by lethal injection at the @entity14 in @entity15 , the @entity0 @entity11 announced it had postponed the execution until monday " due to weather and associated scheduling issues , " department spokeswoman @entity10 said in an email			1
@entity8 was convicted in a february 1997 murder plot that targeted her husband in suburban @entity21			1
she was romantically involved with @entity22 and conspired with the 43 - year - old to have her husband , @entity24 , killed , according to court testimony			2
@entity22 wanted @entity27 to file for a divorce , but she was concerned that her husband would " not leave her alone if she simply divorced him , " court documents said			1
the @entity31 had already divorced once , in 1993 , and they remarried in 1995			0
details of the crime , as laid out at trial and provided by @entity0 attorney general @entity33 , are as follows : @entity22 and @entity27 planned the murder for months			1
on february 7 , 1997 , she dropped @entity22 off at her home , gave him a nightstick and hunting knife and went out dancing with girlfriends			0
@entity24 also spent the evening away from home , going to a church friend 's house to work on cars			2
@entity22 lay in wait until he returned			0
when @entity24 came home around 11:30 p.m. , @entity22 forced him by knifepoint into a car and drove him to a remote area of @entity50			0
there , @entity22 ordered his victim into the woods , took his watch and wallet to make it look like a robbery , hit him in the head with the nightstick and stabbed @entity24 in the neck eight to 10 times			0
@entity27 arrived just as the murder took place , but did not immediately get out of her car			1
she later checked to make sure her husband was dead , then @entity22 followed her in @entity24 's car to retrieve a can of kerosene that @entity27 had left for him			1
@entity22 set her husband 's car on fire in an effort to hide evidence and left the scene with @entity27			1

authorities kicked off a search			0
@entity27 , meanwhile , went on local television appealing to the public for information on her husband 's whereabouts			1
her and @entity22 's story started to unravel after a series of police interviews			2
on february 20 , @entity24 's face - down body was found about a mile from his car			2
an autopsy determined the cause of death to be knife wounds to the neck , but the medical examiner could n't tell which strike killed @entity24 because animals had devoured the skin and soft tissue on the right side of his neck			2
on february 24 , @entity22 confessed to the killing and implicated @entity27 , who was arrested the next day and charged			1
while in jail awaiting trial , @entity27 grew angry when she heard @entity22 was to receive a 25 - year sentence for his role in the murder			1
( @entity22 is serving life in prison at a facility in @entity111 , according to @entity113 records			0
) she began writing letters to hire a third person who would falsely confess to taking her to the crime scene at gunpoint			0

@entity27 has exhausted all state and federal appeals , the attorney general said in a statement			1
the @entity128 and @entity129 denied her clemency request , @entity131 , a spokesman for the board , said wednesday			0
in the clemency application , @entity8 's lawyers argued she was equally or less culpable than @entity22 , who actually did the killing			1
both defendants were offered identical plea bargains before trial : life in prison with an agreement to not seek parole for 25 years			0
@entity22 accepted the plea bargain and testified against his former girlfriend			0
@entity8 was willing to plead guilty , her current lawyers said , but consulted with her trial lawyer and asked prosecutors to remove the stipulation about waiting 25 years to apply for parole			1
according to her clemency appeal , her lead trial attorney , @entity149 , said he thought the jury would not sentence her to death " because she was a woman and because she did not actually kill @entity154			2
... i should have pushed her to take the plea but did not because i thought we would get straight up life if she was convicted			0
" her appeal lawyers also argued that @entity8 had expressed deep remorse for her actions , become a model inmate and grown spiritually			1
they said her death would cause further hardship for her two children			2
according to the @entity165 between 1973 and 2012 -- the most recent data available -- 178 death sentences have been imposed upon female offenders			2

she also requested a glass of lemonade and cherry - vanilla ice cream for dessert			1
currently the only woman on @entity0 's death row , @entity8 could be the second woman in the state 's history to be executed			1
the first was @entity1 , an @entity2 maid who was sentenced to death by an all - white , all - male jury in 1944			1
she claimed self - defense for killing a man who held her against her will , threatened her life and appeared poised to hit her with a metal bar before she fired the fatal shot			0
sixty year after her execution , @entity0 's parole board posthumously pardoned her after finding that " it was a grievous error to deny ( her ) clemency			2
" such pardons are rare , but so are executions of women			0
