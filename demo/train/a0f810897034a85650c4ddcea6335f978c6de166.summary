@entity0 , @entity1 -- on a sand swept stretch of @entity5 , a high - ranking @entity1 general put his country 's mission there into perspective			1
the repurcussions of @entity11 lasted decades for @entity1			1
he explained to a @entity14 delegation that @entity1 troops remind @entity5 locals of two things about the mission : they are not @entity19 and they know how difficult it is to live under foreign occupation			1
it is hard to ignore the incomparable price @entity1 paid during @entity11 it was attacked by @entity24 , invaded by the @entity19 , and became home to the notorious @entity24 concentration camp @entity27			1
after six brutal years , @entity1 were the victors in war but losers in peace , living for four decades under @entity19 repression			1
many here will tell you they still have not come to terms with their fate after the war			0
seven decades after the start of @entity11 , the conflict still defines @entity1 identity and history			1
september 1 , 2009 in @entity0 , @entity1 turned out to be a blue sky day even as dignitaries and notably the leaders of @entity1 , @entity45 and @entity24 turned out to remember the dark horrors that so changed their histories			1
the leaders laid wreaths to honor the ' defenders of @entity0 ' , the men who died in the battle that started it all			0
it was here at this strategic port on the @entity56 , @entity57 , now @entity57 , that @entity24 's surprise attack on @entity1 triggered six years of bloodletting , a savage @entity60 and the death of more than 50 million people			1
the @entity1 prime minister , @entity63 , called it a war against humanity itself			2
@entity63 also answered critics who felt his country and the world should now move on from @entity11 he warned that if anniversaries are not marked and ceremonies not planned , there may be nothing to shield us from the brutality of future wars			2
but still today the events of the last 70 years have left their mark and fueled some modern day controversies			1
send us your war stories @entity45 prime minister @entity82 tried to appeal directly to the people of @entity1 in an open letter			2
he reminded them that at least 27 million @entity45 died in the conflict but also warned against equating the @entity19 's role in @entity11 with the menace of @entity90 's @entity89			2
. exploiting memory , anatomizing history and seeking pretexts for mutual complaints and resentment causes a lot of harm			0
he backed that up with public comments saying , " if we talk about an objective assessment of history , we should understand that it had no one color			0
it was varied and there were huge number of mistakes committed by many sides			0
all these actions , in one way or another , created conditions for the beginning of a large - scale aggression by @entity24			0
" @entity82 was at the heart of a tug - of - war over the war			0
some @entity1 say @entity117 was as evil and complicit as @entity90 during the war			2
@entity45 say that callously overlooks the sacrifice of @entity45 in defeating @entity89 and liberating @entity119			0
in fact , it took @entity123 chancellor @entity122 to put their achievement in perspective			0
she said that a unified , peaceful @entity119 was a blessing and indeed a miracle .			0
