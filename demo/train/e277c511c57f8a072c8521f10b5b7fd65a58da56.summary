@entity1 , @entity0 -- high net - worth individuals will always find ways to enjoy , celebrate and flaunt their wealth -- the yacht at @entity7 , the chateau , the vineyard and the @entity9			0
the very wealthy add to this their private jets -- @entity12 and @entity13 -- providing mobile bedrooms and boardrooms for upwards of four people			2
the lavish interior of the custom @entity20 but now those who are not just very wealthy , but super wealthy , have a new option -- the chateau in the sky			1
the arrival of the -- much delayed -- @entity20 " super " jumbo aircraft , which is due to make its debut revenue - earning flight with @entity29 later this year , heralds a whole new era of super private jet			1
the @entity20 is a four - engined , twin - decked , wide - body jet aircraft built at @entity20 's factories throughout @entity35 and assembled at its facility in @entity37 , @entity38			1
larger than any previous civil aircraft , the @entity20 is 30 per cent bigger than the current largest jetliner , @entity41 's 747 - 400			1
in standard three - class layout , the @entity20 can hold 555 passengers			1
in an all - economy configuration , the @entity20 could hold more than 800			1
this allows the private buyer an unrivalled space in which to create the ultimate statement of luxury and power			2
private jets have been on the market since the 1960s			2
but they tended to be far smaller than commercial passenger aircraft			0
some private customers wanted the comforts afforded to those heads of state who had their own large jetliners at their disposal			2
most famous of these , of course is @entity61 , the official jet transport -- though actually there are two @entity64 , both modified @entity66 -- of the @entity67			0
the demand for larger - scale private and corporate jets has been such that the major aircraft manufacturers , @entity20 and @entity41 , now offer modified versions of their passenger aircraft -- the @entity73 ( @entity73 ) and @entity74 ( @entity75 )			1
both of these are based on short - haul , narrow - bodied types -- the @entity41 series and @entity82 series -- both of which seat fewer than 200 people in commercial passenger configuration			0
but the @entity20 's massive size -- the combined floor - space of the two decks is over 6,000 square feet -- dwarfs these otherwise capacious aircraft			1
in comparison , the total floor area of an @entity74 is 905 square feet			1
as soon as @entity20 announced it was to embark on a project to develop the first " super " jumbo in 2001 , it received an order for a private variant of the jet ( then known by its codename of @entity20 ) from a client in the @entity101			1
the aircraft 's size is one thing			0
but a luxury purchase of this magnitude also needs a sumptuous interior			2
this was to be provided by design consultancy @entity109 from its offices in @entity111 , @entity1 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114			0
over the years the company has been called upon to design bespoke interiors for aircraft including the @entity118 and @entity119 , and widebody aircraft including the @entity121 , @entity122 - 600 and @entity123			0
" we were excited when we were awarded the contract , " says the company 's president @entity124 , " and at the time no one had ever conceived of designing a private interior for such an aircraft			2
unfortunately for us , the client backed out of the project and opted for a smaller [ @entity122 ] aircraft			0
" we only created very preliminary layouts and basic renderings of the interior			0
we were then approached in early 2005 to design the interior of the @entity20			1
we felt very fortunate to get a second opportunity to design the cabin for this new customer			0
" beneath the two passenger decks of this modified super jumbo is an @entity61 - style air - stair -- allowing access to the tarmac without the need for a sky - bridge or external staircase -- and a crew dining area , crew gallery , crew bathroom , sleeping quarters for eight on bunk beds , a communications room and spiral staircase leading to the main deck			1
the main deck contains an entry lounge , grand lounge , dining area with seating for 14 , main deck galley and staff seating			0
then the upper deck houses a stateroom , master bathroom ( with shower and hot tub ) , office , library , vip bedroom ( en - suite ) , guest bedroom ( en - suite ) , upper deck galley , family dining area with seating for eight and an " @entity179 lounge "			0
the cost of the interior adds a further $ 150 million to the basic $ 350 million cost of the aircraft			1
@entity124 wo n't disclose the identity of the client , leading to much internet speculation			0
it 's most likely , however , that the client is the ruler of an oil - rich @entity189 state rather than a captain of industry ( @entity191 , famously , travels economy class ) .			0
