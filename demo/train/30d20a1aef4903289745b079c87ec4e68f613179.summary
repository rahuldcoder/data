-- congratulations , everyone : we 've finally got rid of the @entity3 forever			1
what a burden off our shoulders ! finally , we will have a @entity6			1
it 's only a matter of days until the @entity3 's members are rounded up in jail once again , and @entity11 's normal state is restored			1
that normal state , where people look good without beards or veils , those " good - looking people " we see on tv			1
@entity11 will finally be a free , liberal country			1
what 's that ? some @entity3 members died at the @entity24 headquarters ? and why were they there in the first place ? are n't you glad this happened to them ? why are n't you gloating ? you must be a @entity3 supporter ! you must be an enemy of the military and the state and probably work as a part - time terrorist ! no. i support the demonstrations that started on june 30th and saw that former president @entity35 was unfit to be president , but that does n't deny the fact that i believe there needs to be a thorough investigation into the events at the @entity24 headquarters , that i 'd like to know how long the @entity19 ' tv channels will be closed ; and that i find the private media to be full of discrimination and inciting rhetoric			1
no , no , critics might say : you 're being soft ! keep your human rights to yourself			1
these people can only be dealt with violently			1
we have to purge the country of these people			2
the above is a reflection of the state of mind of many who are on a " victory high , " or so they imagine themselves to be			1
the fascist nature of those people is no different than that of the @entity19 who think that their enemies ' disappearance off this planet would be a victory for the religion of @entity66			1
but those on this victory high consider themselves to be different ; they justify their fascism for the " good of the country			1
" these people with their liberal values and reverence for freedom differ very little from radical preacher @entity77 , who was infamous for his favorite quote : " may @entity66 relieve us of you and your likes ( the liberals )			2
" i do not trust or believe the @entity3			2
we have witnessed from experience that they do not keep their word and lie time and again , as long as it serves their political agenda			2
they have their means of manipulating religion and justifying their actions so long as it serves their politics			2
yes , the @entity3 has done all of this and more ; and for that , @entity35 deserved to be protested against by the masses , and his organization deserved the abhorrence and repulsion towards them from the people			1
the senior @entity3 leaders need to undergo investigation on charges of inciting violence , as well as their shady international relations			2
this is the legal and political course that needs to take place			2
i could write volumes on the lack of intelligence on the part of the @entity3 and their corruption of both religion and politics , but that is another battle that requires different tools			2
we are losing this battle before it has even begun : those who claim to be freedom fighters and have been denouncing the fascism and discrimination of the @entity3 are now contributing to the building of sympathy towards them			2
they are a disgrace to the principles of freedom they claim to stand for			0
we are returning par excellence to the atmosphere of the 90s when we settled for " the security option " and the media corruption and let the chests rage with a fire of hatred and allowed extremism to deepen day after day			0
i do believe that shutting down the @entity146 channels was an important decision during a sensitive period , but i 'm now calling for their return			0
let them talk as they wish ; it has only served to make people hate and be repulsed by them			0
do not give them the chance to play the victim			0
what are you afraid of ? of their discriminatory media rhetoric ? or of their public political stupidity ? my dear @entity166 liberal , allow me to remind you that just a few weeks ago you were desperately complaining about how grim the future looked , but now that you have been " relieved " of them you have become a carbon copy of their fascism and discrimination			0
you could respond by saying that they deserve it , that they supported the security forces and used them to overpower you , to cheat and spread rumors and widen sectarian strife			1
but is that really your argument ? have you made of their lowly ways a better alternative for you than abiding by the principles you have stood by for so long ? they lost their moral compass a long time ago			0
do you want to follow suit ? do n't you see that by inciting violence towards @entity190 and @entity191 you are exactly like them , when they incite violence towards the @entity195 , the @entity196 , the @entity197 , and the other @entity198 who opposed the @entity3 ? we have replaced the " enemies of @entity19 " scarecrow with the " enemies of the state " scarecrow			1
the ideas , approaches and appearances have disappeared , and all that remains are fascism and discrimination that unite us over hatred , rather than reconcile our prejudices			0
take the leaders of the @entity3 to court and investigate the events at the @entity24 headquarters			0
ensure the autonomy of justice whether the victims are from your camp or the other 's			1
demand a clear framework within which all political parties are to operate , so that no party can ever spread such discriminatory , sectarian rhetoric again			0
yes , the leaders of the @entity3 must be tried just as the leaders of the @entity226 were tried in the case of provision of enough evidence and within the limits of the law			0
but remember you will never be able to erase the existence of those thousands off the face of the @entity234			0
you will not be able arrest those thousands and their families and children , and you will not be able to prevent them from winning syndicate elections			0
all you 're currently doing is repeating their past mistakes by turning a blind eye to those thousands , but you are only burying a living truth that will come back to hit you , or the coming generations , in the face			0
kudos to those who have not allowed the " victory high " to rob them of their humanity ; to those few who are currently isolated by everyone else and are not welcome in either camp unless they go with the current flow of hatred and gloating			1
@entity257 has now become an isolated island among wild waves of discrimination and extremism			0
on this island live those isolated few , their voices fading in the midst of the roaring cries for vengeance and murder			0
i 'm not optimistic about a population increase on that island anytime soon			0
but maybe in the future people will migrate to it and try to get to know this thing called humanity that we 've all been stripped of			0
what i fear most is if a time comes when we pass by that island and cry in dismay : " @entity280 , nobody lives there anymore			0
" this is an edited version of an article that was first published in @entity284 newspaper in @entity11 on july 16 in @entity285 and was translated by @entity286 at @entity288 's request for the website @entity290			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity288 .			1

@entity288 warns against the " victory high ' some feel after @entity35 's ouster
@entity288 : some of the @entity299 forces are just as *objectionable* as the @entity19
