-- a bond hearing is scheduled for friday in the case of @entity4 , the neighborhood watch volunteer who fatally shot 17 - year - old @entity5 in @entity6 , the court said wednesday			1
the new judge in the case , @entity9 , will preside , according to the @entity10			1
the previous judge in the case approved a motion wednesday to disqualify her after it was revealed that her husband works with a @entity0 legal analyst who has commented on the case			1
@entity20 circuit judge @entity19 said in her decision that while the findings on each basis were " legally insufficient " for disqualification , " the cumulative effect of the events and the totality of the circumstances provides a legally sufficient basis for this court to grant the motion to disqualify , " a statement from the court said			1
new judge ' no soft touch ' this week , @entity19 is on temporary assignment from the @entity6 @entity36 and is hearing oral arguments at the @entity38 in @entity39 , court spokeswoman @entity34 said in a statement tuesday			1
wednesday 's order directed the case to be returned to the chief judge for reassignment , who in turn ordered that @entity9 be appointed to preside over the @entity4 case			1
@entity4 , 28 , fatally shot @entity5 in @entity48 , @entity6 , on february 26 , a killing he has said was in self - defense			2
the case has stirred civil rights activists nationwide and drawn intense publicity			0
the city of @entity48 has scheduled a community meeting at 6:30 p.m. thursday at a church to provide members of the public an opportunity to discuss the incident , according to the @entity48 mayor 's office			0
mayor @entity64 will be among officials attending , the office said			0
case divides @entity48 @entity19 said last week that she would entertain motions to disqualify her from the trial because her husband is a law partner of @entity69 's			1
@entity4 approached @entity69 about representing him			2
@entity69 is now a @entity0 contributor , providing analysis on this case			1
@entity69 said @entity4 " contacted my office , attempting to reach me , and wanted to hire me to represent him " on march 13			2
one of his law partners relayed that request to @entity69 , who declined			0
he explained later that he knew how taking on " big national cases ( can ) take a lot out of you " and wanted to have more time to spend with his children			0
" i decided simply not to , " the @entity82 lawyer said			0
@entity69 acknowledged tuesday , " it 's an appearance of a conflict , an appearance of an impropriety " for @entity19 to preside over the case			1
but he said he thought she did nothing improper by waiting for a request from attorneys instead of offering to recuse herself first			0
" i do n't think she did anything out of the ordinary for this extraordinary situation , " he said			0
meanwhile , media organizations , including @entity0 , petitioned @entity97 monday to reverse an order sealing court records in @entity4 's prosecution			1
prosecutors did not object when @entity4 's attorneys asked @entity19 to seal records last week			1
the judge ordered the court filings and other records sealed " without giving the public and press an opportunity to oppose closure , " the media said in its motion			2
@entity6 law requires a judge to consider whether the records closure is needed to " prevent a serious and imminent threat " to justice , the media members argued			2
the court must also find that there is no alternative to sealing the records that would provide a fair trial and that the action would not be " broader than necessary to accomplish this purpose , " they said			0
in addition to @entity0 , several broadcasting and newspaper companies -- including the publishers of @entity128 , the @entity129 and the @entity130 -- are part of the effort to unseal the documents			2
@entity4 defense attorney @entity135 said monday that he favors keeping documents sealed in this case in large part because of concerns that witnesses might be contacted and in danger if certain information is released			1
" ( @entity144 ) overall philosophy ( is ) to keep the information flow concentrated within the court system , " he said			0
" it 's much better handled there			0
" as to his client , @entity135 said he speaks " at least a couple times a day " with @entity4 , whom he described as doing well physically but " frightened			2
" @entity4 is scheduled to return to court friday for a bail hearing			1
@entity135 says he hopes his client will be eligible for bail after that hearing and eventually be allowed to go free until the trial			0
if he does get out , though , the lawyer said , there are legitimate fears about @entity4 's safety			1
" there have been a lot of emotions that have come forward in this case , and some of those emotions have shown themselves in bad ways , " @entity135 said			0
@entity9 has served on the circuit court since 1996			2
he is currently assigned to the @entity167 but has previously served in the @entity168 , and @entity170 divisions of the circuit court			0
a 2011 poll by the @entity173 rated lester the top judge in the county in terms of legal knowledge and diligence			0
he had the second - highest overall score among @entity20 circuit judges in that survey , which also ranked the jurists for impartiality , freedom from bias and demeanor			0
@entity0 's @entity187 and @entity188 contributed to this report .			1
