at the center of the government report is what happened after @entity25 agents and lawyers from the @entity27 , who at the time was investigating the affair with @entity9 , approached @entity5 at a food court and moved the conversation to a hotel room nearby			1
the counsel -- which was led by @entity35 -- was investigating @entity9 for a number of issues , including his extramarital affair with @entity5			1
" associate independent counsel @entity40 confronted @entity5 with her false affidavit and other criminal activities relations to the @entity44 case , " the report states			1
" in an effort to gain her cooperation , @entity40 told her she could be prosecuted on multiple criminal charges , but said if she cooperated , the @entity15 would take it into account in charging decisions			0
" in doing so , however , the agents and lawyers denied @entity5 attempts to speak with her lawyer , @entity54			1
" because they feared she would want to call @entity54 , " the report -- which was posted online by the @entity12 -- states , " @entity15 lawyers devised a deliberate strategy to discourage her from doing so			0
" one way of doing that was telling @entity5 that contacting the lawyer would " get less value for her cooperation			1
" to sum up the confrontation , the report -- which was ordered by @entity67 , @entity35 's successor -- states : " on the slippery slope , @entity40 did not stop			0
" the @entity70 provided @entity1 with the report and spokeswoman @entity72 said the reason this report was able to be released - but other from the @entity35 investigation were not - was because the report was not clearly marked as sealed			2
" if the @entity78 report authored by @entity79 was considered sealed by the @entity80 , it should have been clearly marked to indicate its status			0
it was not , " @entity72 said in an emailed statement			0
" if the report was marked as under seal , it would not have been released			0
" the release of the 2000 report on @entity5 comes at a time when the former @entity7 intern has stepped back into the public eye after more than a decade of trying to be private			1
@entity5 delivered her first high - profile speech since the affair at @entity95 ' 30 under 30 summit on tuesday and earlier this year @entity96 announced that the former @entity7 intern was a contributor to the magazine			2
since then , @entity5 has penned pieces on cyberbullying and her life after the @entity9 affair			1
at the @entity95 appearance , @entity5 spoke at length about her confrontation with agents and lawyers that was detailed in the government report			1
" it was just like you see in the movies , " @entity5 said of the encounter			2
" imagine , one minute i was waiting to meet a friend in the food court and the next i realized she had set me up , as two @entity25 agents flashed their badges at me			0
" she added : " immediately following , in a nearby hotel room , i was threatened with up to 27 years in jail for denying the affair in an affidavit and other alleged crimes			2
when you 're only 24 yourself , that 's a long time			0
chillingly , told that my mother too might face prosecution if i did n't cooperate and wear a wire ... my friends and my family were subpoenaed to testify against me			0
" the government report - titled the " report of the special counsel concerning allegations of professional misconduct by the @entity27 in @entity134 with the encounter with @entity5 " - substantiates @entity5 's story			1
" for nearly twelve hours , the @entity15 lawyers were in a hotel room with this hysterical but very focused young woman , " reads the report			0
@entity5 , however , never cooperated with the investigation			2
and while @entity9 was impeached by the @entity7 , the @entity142 acquitted the president of the @entity7 charges in 1999			2
opinion : shame on @entity5 opinion : stop judging @entity5			0
