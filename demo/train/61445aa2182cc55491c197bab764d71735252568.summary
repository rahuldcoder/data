-- her name was @entity3			2
she had an answer for everything , even questions i did n't ask her			2
she dominated team meetings , nearly jumping out of her chair with " look at me ! " -- type comments aimed directly at the boss			1
there are some tactics to help you survive team destroyers			1
the rest of us sitting there , jaws slack with amazement and disgust -- we were merely a load she had to carry on her back			1
his name was @entity26 , and he had n't done a full day 's work in years , but he sure knew how to draw us into his life of woe			1
one night at 10 p.m. , i found myself finishing his report on deadline			2
he could n't be there , he said , because his father was sick			2
by that point , i was n't even sure he had a father			2
but there i was , alone , frustrated , and exhausted , in a state of loathing for work so intense i wished i could ditch it all			2
@entity0 : the truth about saying no at work and that is exactly where a dysfunctional co-worker -- or as i call them , an " un-teammate " -- can put you			1
it 's a crying shame , because working alongside a good team player is one of life 's most fulfilling experiences			1
she makes work enjoyable ; she makes it feel like something bigger than a paycheck			2
working with team destroyers , well , destroys all that			1
they slow work down ; they sap its fun , trust , and creativity			2
and in the process , they invariably undermine the candid and energized debate that characterizes any successful group			2
so why are n't they all sent packing ? in good organizations , most are -- eventually			2
but many team destroyers are like workplace @entity76 , escaping damage to their own careers while making everyone else look bad			1
these are the people you must survive			2
but how ? the answer depends on the type of un-teammate you 're dealing with			2
generally speaking , there are five : boss haters , stars , sliders , @entity90 , and @entity91			1
each species has its own way of poisoning the environment and its own antidote			0
the first thing you can do is start with the assumption that virtually every team destroyer is an unhappy person			1
no one tries to damage co-workers , a team , or an entire organization without being a bit emotionally damaged themselves			1
@entity0 : 6 signs you 're in the wrong job boss haters , stars and sliders let 's start with the boss haters -- you know the type			1
@entity115 will tell you his disdain for authority is a reasonable reaction to the tyranny of incompetent bosses			0
@entity122 will tell you she refuses to be oppressed by corporate lackeys			0
other boss haters have personal issues behind their nitpicking resistance to every directive from above			1
i once met a manager who told me , " for a long time , i hated all my bosses because my father was a cruel authoritarian -- i almost ruined my own career			0
thank @entity135 i came to my senses			0
" such conversion experiences are rare , however			0
most boss haters persist , using every kind of subterfuge from eye - rolling to outright belligerence , until management loses patience and ousts them			1
some @entity138 are hard to extricate because of union rules or special skills			0
if that 's your situation , your best approach as the peer of a @entity150 is a freeze - out			1
do n't belabor @entity115 's resistance or try reasoning with @entity122			0
simply isolate ; refuse to listen to their ongoing complaints			1
once they 're cut off from the group , @entity138 tend to lose their energy			0
make no mistake -- organizations could not survive without their results			0
fortunately , many key players are @entity159 largely because they are the best kind of employee , inclusive and inspiring , but some @entity159 can develop into real bullies			1
my team at a consulting firm had to endure @entity170 , an articulate ( and , yes , brilliant ) economics major from @entity173 whom our clients adored			1
( like other people in this piece , his name has been changed			0
) sensing he was untouchable , @entity170 would bulldoze his ideas through the team process and ridicule anyone who dared to disagree			1
another group i worked with suffered through @entity186 , a marketing " guru " who 'd been stolen away from another firm to bestow her genius on us			0
she passively disrupted our discussions by not participating , her silence sending the message " this nonsense is beneath me			0
" we did n't have much recourse			0
few bosses want to hear nattering about a goose that 's laying golden eggs			0
your best option in terms of self - preservation is to accept stars for the good they do and ignore the bad			1
i 've seen only one other approach work , but it 's hard to recommend			0
this technique involves playing to a @entity159 's weakness -- the need for constant praise			1
as strange as it may seem , many @entity159 are deeply insecure and can not receive enough ego stroking from bosses			1
co-workers can play the same game , thereby drawing a @entity159 back into the team process			1
but do n't try this unless you really feel the love for your own @entity170 or @entity186 ; a phony intervention wo n't work			0
sliders are former stars , resting on their laurels and undermining their teams with apathy			1
their unspoken excuse is " i 've proven my worth around here ; i do n't need to scramble anymore			0
" take @entity230 , a crusty old newsman who had won the @entity231 for his reporting in @entity233			0
i met him when we were both assigned to the same investigative team 20 years ago			1
the young reporters , myself included , fairly trembled in @entity230 's exalted presence , but within weeks , it became obvious to us that he had no interest in interviewing sources or late - night stakeouts			1
he preferred to sit around the office drinking coffee and telling war stories to his in - house fan club			1
fast - forward to the end of the project : a front - page article under the byline -- you guessed it -- @entity230 and the newspaper team			1
the editors knew @entity230 had done minimal work , but in the newspaper business , one way of keeping score is by the number of @entity231 winners on staff			0
my solution at the time was to moan and groan with my teammates about the injustice of it all			0
sliders will always live inside a protective bubble that no peer can pierce , because they deliver tangible value to an institution			1
do n't bother griping ; instead , buck up and join the slider 's fan club , respecting him for contributions you can only imagine making			1
with that mind - set , you might even be able to turn your slider into a mentor			1
to this day , i remember what @entity230 taught me about reporting -- when i finally dumped my pointless indignation and asked him			0
@entity0 : 10 ways to love your job right now pity parties and self - promoters pity parties are those un-teammates who have an excuse for every act of inaction			1
their elderly aunt came to visit or , like @entity26 , their father is sick			0
the most expert pity parties concoct long - running sympathy stories : bad backs , bad marriages , bad childcare , and so on			2
i do n't want to sound harsh			0
sometimes people really do need time off or special accommodations , but @entity90 make an art form of wriggling out of responsibility , and you 're left wondering if you 're a heel for resenting them -- or a dupe for helping them			1
your best strategy is to steer clear of @entity90 and their appeals for help			1
you 'll need to steel yourself to say no as often as humanly possible , even if they promise you , " this is the very last time			0
" the line i ended up using with @entity26 was " i 'm in a bind too			0
did you ask @entity320 for help ? " ( @entity320 was our boss			2
) that response did not put an immediate end to @entity26 's ways ; he went looking for other enablers			0
still , it sent the signal -- both to @entity26 and my co-workers -- that i would not cut side deals			2
when enough of us started saying no , he left us alone			0
the final form of dysfunctional coworker is the @entity335 , like " @entity336 " @entity3 , who saw every team assignment as an opportunity for personal advancement			1
in their pursuit of fame and glory , self - promoters occasionally sabotage peers			1
i once had a co-worker who used staff meetings , with the boss in attendance , to vociferously attack every other writer 's work as " hackneyed " or , her favorite word , " superficial			2
" if we pushed back against her critiques , she accused us of being competitive with her			2
there was no way to win			0
usually , that 's the case with self - promoters			1
they can drub you with their narcissistic " logic " -- they 're right ; you 're just defensive -- and wear you down with their egocentric career campaign			0
but they ca n't smite everyone forever			0
after a few promotions , the moment comes for every self - promoter when they need a favor or help , and there is no one left to ask			2
so keep your head down and wait			0
and most important , keep overdelivering , even if your local weasel tries to steal all the credit			0
self - promoters might get more praise than they deserve , but in any good organization , real team players ultimately get what they deserve : respect and admiration			1
if you have any doubt about that , you might ask @entity3			0
i stopped working with her years ago , but i recently heard that the company asked her to move on -- just when she thought she had achieved the position of vice president , the goal she 'd been gunning for			0
colleagues tell me she interviewed for jobs for a year afterward , but with less than enthusiastic references , she could n't land one			0
she ended up going out on her own as a consultant , and i just learned she 's a tireless and admired mentor for young women in a leadership program in @entity401			2
i do n't know what she tells them , but i can venture a guess : do everything you can at work to be a great team player , and learn to survive ( and thrive ) around those who are not			2
