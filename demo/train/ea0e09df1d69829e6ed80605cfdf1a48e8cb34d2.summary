-- @entity1 might be feeling the pressure at @entity3 , but the world 's most famous soccer coach has taken time out to help a man from a tiny island nation who fully understands the importance of high - intensity decision - making			2
in one life , @entity10 is an air traffic controller			1
in another , he is coach of the @entity14 , which this weekend will play at the @entity15 for the first time			0
" @entity1 is very friendly with the president of @entity20 so when we qualified , the president spoke to him -- and @entity1 then invited me to @entity3 for one week , " @entity10 told @entity0 's human to @entity18			1
@entity1 is known as " the @entity23 , " a winner of major trophies at top clubs such as @entity3 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 in his native @entity30			2
he is one of the most sought - after coaches in world football despite his team 's difficulties in @entity36 this season			1
@entity10 is being hailed as @entity20 's very own tactical magician , having in october guided the " @entity44 " through the final stages of the @entity41 qualification process for the first time since the country earned independence from @entity30 in 1975			1
" there is only one ' @entity23 , ' " laughs @entity10			2
" he is fantastic , very intelligent and has a big heart -- it was a pleasure to meet him			0
" i attended five training sessions and two matches , talked tactics with both @entity1 and some of the players , but the main thing i learned was his clarity in terms of his communication with his squad and technical staff			0
" the 46 - year - old expects to return to the control tower at the international airport on the island of @entity62 after his stint as national coach ends , having taken time off his day job			1
he had to employ all his skills to take the islanders through a qualifying route that climaxed with a two - leg clash against @entity71 's @entity71 -- four - time winners of the @entity41 trophy , and led by one of the world 's leading players , @entity74			0
" in air traffic control , we have to think very fast and take decisions very quickly -- there is no time to wait , " @entity77 says			1
" there is a lot of pressure in air traffic control because there are a lot of planes			1
but the air traffic controller skills help me with coaching because i am also working with a lot of pressure in football as well			1
" he was appointed national team boss in july 2010 , having worked as assistant coach for the previous year			2
he also led the nation 's under - 21 team to success at the 2009 @entity100 for @entity102 - speaking countries			0
" it is far easier to be a football coach than an air traffic controller because you have enormous responsibility when there are so many planes flying around , " @entity77 says			1
a fine all - round sportsman in his youth , he played for leading local football side @entity111 , competing in a league spread over nine of the 10 islands -- with a population of just half a million -- that make up @entity20 's archipelago			1
but in 1990 , a year when the islands ' unemployment rate hit a high of 20 % , @entity120 -- who has also represented his country at basketball and table tennis -- leapt at the chance to train as an air traffic controller			1
continuing his work while also playing football , @entity10 went on to play for the national team , as did his father and all four his of brothers -- one of whom enjoyed a successful professional career in @entity30			1
one of the biggest challenges -- and ironies -- of his dual career is that the football federation 's limited coffers mean the air traffic controller has been unable to fly to @entity141 to watch those expatriate players who have come on board for @entity20 's continental mission			1
over the years , the emigration from the islands has been so great that the number of @entity20 and their descendants living overseas now exceeds the population of those at home , so @entity10 is forced to use the very simplest of methods to follow his footballers ' form			2
" we have no money to fly to @entity141 -- as it 's very expensive -- so this makes my job very hard , " he says			0
" so if players are playing for their @entity141 team , then we believe that they are good -- and then they come to the national team			0
otherwise , we just watch on tv or on dvds that we have been sent			0
" after achieving independence as a nation , @entity20 had to wait 17 years before winning a competitive match			0
team captain @entity167 , known as @entity167 , sometimes has to pinch himself to realize the @entity44 will be performing on @entity169 's biggest stage			0
the 34 - year - old defender , who won his first cap back in 2002 , has played club football in @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 , but this is a career highlight			0
" to qualify my team is something special , " @entity167 told @entity0			0
" it 's a gift , first of all to even get to the @entity15 , but then to open the tournament , i do n't think there is something better than this			0
" @entity20 will take on host nation @entity169 in saturday 's first match in @entity184 , and will also play @entity185 and 1976 champions @entity187 in their @entity189 matches			2
despite the team 's lack of resources in the face of such experienced opposition , @entity167 says his team will be inspired by a sheer love of the game			0
" football in the @entity20 is the same as religion			2
everybody likes football in @entity20			2
here it 's first you must go to church , after that you must play football			0
" and @entity10 is fully aware of his team 's responsibility to meet the aspirations of the @entity20 fans			1
" we recognize the effort the country has made to support us , so we will do our best to repay our country , " he said			0
@entity20 's touchdown at the tournament should certainly be eased by having @entity10 at their helm , no matter what turbulence the debutants may encounter on their maiden flight into the unknown .			1
