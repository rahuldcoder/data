-- thirteen - year - old @entity2 did n't just pack her bags and run away to the circus , she signed a 10 - year contract with a circus master after fleeing from long hours of domestic servitude in @entity8			2
taken to @entity9 , she then endured years of appalling and dangerous working conditions for no pay			0
a @entity13 charity helped @entity2 finally say goodbye to the circus			0
@entity2 's story is not the same as other victims , but there are disturbing similarities : threats , sexual and labor exploitation , often cruelty , sometimes brutality			0
( to read @entity2 's story , please go to @entity24 's 2013 publication , hear their story			0
her name was changed to protect her identity			0
) despite her terrible experiences , @entity2 is one of the fortunate ones			0
there are millions of women , children and men across the world who face similar experiences			1
human trafficking is now worth around $ 32 billion annually to the criminals and their networks			1
it is one of the world 's most profitable crimes			1
i recently attended a debate on human trafficking at the @entity47 in @entity48			1
other speakers included oscar - winner @entity50 , @entity24 's good will ambassador against human trafficking			1
she spoke with dignity and with passion , which found echoes in the words of many of the other speakers , including @entity47 @entity58 ban ki - moon			0
the debate ensured that this crime remains on the radar screens of @entity47 member states , one decade after the @entity63 entered into force			1
there is also some good news			0
today , 83 % of countries have proper legislation to combat human trafficking			1
in 2009 , this figure was only 60 %			0
so far , 175 states are parties to the @entity73 and 154 are party to the @entity63 that is the foundation for our work against this heinous crime			2
fifteen countries have also ratified the protocol since 2010			2
this , however , leaves 39 member states who still have to ratify the protocol and unite the entire world against human trafficking			1
impunity is another festering issue			0
sixteen percent of countries have never recorded a single conviction for human trafficking			1
@entity92 : rescued @entity8 find new life in circus based on @entity24 's @entity99 , between 2006 and 2009 , the number of detectable cases of human trafficking for forced labor doubled from 18 % to 36 %			1
it shows that more action against this crime is being undertaken by law enforcement bodies , but there is room for improvement			1
there are also problems with data collection and analysis			0
our human trafficking report contained information from 132 member states			1
almost a third of countries failed to provide information to the report			2
fortunately , there is an international road map : the 3 - year - old @entity121			0
the plan created the @entity124 managed by @entity24			0
so far , the fund has enabled 11 grass - roots organizations to aid victims in situations similar to that of @entity2			0
but the improvements , while encouraging , are coming too slowly to help the millions of victims			1
what is needed is a catalyst			2
my suggestion is an inspirational , but realistic goal : a decade of concrete action to end human trafficking			1
@entity138 founded on international cooperation and coordination			0
arrests made in modern slavery case if we are truly serious about confronting this issue , i would suggest four steps to immediately improve the situation : first , increased victim protection and support , second , universal ratification and full implementation of the @entity73 , as well as its protocol ; third , fresh contributions to the @entity155 from governments , the private sector and the public to assist field organizations ; and fourth , the provision of comprehensive data to understand the nature of this global crime			1
legislation , however , is only the springboard for action			2
every country needs a national action plan closely linked to regional and international efforts to counter human trafficking			1
we also need to hunt down the proceeds flowing from this ugly crime			2
preventing money laundering means working closely with banks and the financial sector to report suspicious financial movements and creating a virtuous circle among financial intelligence units , law enforcement bodies and prosecution authorities			0
but , it is not good enough to simply imprison the guilty traffickers , we must take their money and close down the networks and trafficking routes for good			2
i am aware of the dangers of making unrealistic promises , but i believe we can achieve this goal			0
after all , our reach should always exceed our grasp			0
let 's turn the hourglass over and begin a decade of action to try to rid the world of the misery and suffering caused by human trafficking			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198			2

millions of *people* fall victim to human trafficking , says @entity198
the world has made *progress* in reducing this profitable crime , he says
@entity198 : many countries have passed legislation against trafficking
he says improvements coming too slowly ; a decade of action is needed
