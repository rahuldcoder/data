-- as secretary of state @entity3 pursues new peace negotiations between @entity5 and the @entity6 , he and president @entity2 will need broad - based support in efforts for peace , which will come only through bridging the gulf between those who identify primarily with @entity5 and those who identify primarily with @entity6			1
as a rabbi and the director of a @entity16 human rights organization , i have seen how that gulf inhibits all of us in our ability to support the peace process			2
a few cases in point : a pro-palestinian activist was struggling to understand why the @entity16 community reacts so strongly against calls to boycott and divest from @entity5			2
after all , she told me , boycotts are an accepted nonviolent tactic for achieving a political goal			0
did n't i know about the anti-apartheid struggle in @entity30 ? or the fight for the rights of migrant grape workers in @entity34 ? what about the @entity36 ? but the word " boycott " carries terrible associations for @entity16			0
i explained to her that it is linked in our minds to the boycotts of @entity16 businesses in @entity46 , which presaged the deportations and murders			0
then there 's the history of blood libel , the false accusations of @entity16 violence against @entity51 that often prompted boycotts and worse			0
the very word boycott triggers this communal post-traumatic stress , regardless of the intentions of those advocating for such tactics			0
not long after , the director of a national @entity16 organization complained to me that protests against the occupation , including calls for boycotts and divestment , seek to smear @entity5 's image and de-legitimize the country 's right to exist			2
although i do n't support boycotts of @entity5 , i challenged him to consider that the worst damage to @entity5 's image and credibility might come from the occupation itself			1
the failure of the two sides to communicate has implications far beyond whether @entity81 and @entity82 advocates can get along			0
within the @entity84 , we have seen a breakdown in relationships between @entity16 communities and other minority communities who have long been natural allies for an open , diverse and equitable @entity84			0
the inability to break out of one - sided rhetoric also limits both sides ' willingness to accept the painful concessions that will be necessary for peace			1
those who sympathize primarily with the @entity6 must recognize that the trauma of the holocaust and of thousands of years of @entity99 remains an open wound for the @entity16 community			1
we will never " get over it			0
" acknowledging this trauma does not mean that criticism of @entity5 policy is off limits			2
instead , those protesting the occupation need to clamp down on any rhetoric that crosses the line into anti-semitic stereotyping , that denies @entity16 history and identity , or that dismisses the suffering and human rights of @entity5			2
there can be no space within the anti-occupation movement for negative portrayals of @entity16 , calls to wipe out @entity5 , or diatribes against " zionists , " a word that most @entity16 understand as a barely veiled reference to all of us			2
when @entity127 militants shoot rockets at towns and villages in @entity5 , the @entity16 community needs to hear condemnation from those who most often ally themselves with @entity6			1
those who sympathize primarily with @entity5 must similarly reject dehumanizing rhetoric about @entity6 or @entity134			1
it is vital to acknowledge the day - to - day suffering of @entity6 , who contend with the theft of private land , long and demeaning checkpoint lines , and violence from settlers and soldiers			1
responding with disbelief to painful narratives , or countering with stories of @entity5 's scientific and medical achievements , paints the @entity16 community as tone deaf to the suffering of others			1
when the @entity5 government issues building permits for a new settlement , demolishes a @entity6 home , or levies only minor penalties on @entity16 who attack @entity6 and their property , mainstream @entity16 leaders need to condemn these actions as unjust and destructive of the possibility for peace			1
those on both sides who are unwilling to change their rhetoric should come clean about whether they are actually committed to peace			2
those who tolerate language that demonizes @entity16 or who justify violence against @entity5 civilians must ask themselves whether they are actually most interested in achieving a better future for @entity6 , or whether they are indulging in dangerous anti-semitism			1
those who dismiss @entity6 suffering or who rationalize violence against @entity6 civilians must ask themselves whether they are serious about a two - state solution , or whether they are simply looking for excuses to sustain the occupation indefinitely			1
each side also needs to look forward instead of back			0
jews must acknowledge that this moment is neither the @entity46 of the 1930s nor the @entity5 of the second intifada			0
the very prominence of boycotts , protests and appeals to the @entity193 -- whether we approve of these tactics or not -- reflects a decision by the @entity6 majority to pursue nonviolent efforts to achieve a state			0
those who take up the @entity6 cause must acknowledge that the state of @entity5 and its more than 6 million @entity16 citizens are here to stay			1
both sides need to stop arguing about whose fault it is that previous negotiations have failed			1
it 's easier to attack and defend than to seek to understand the other side 's legitimate needs and emotions			0
but there 's no easy way around it			0
creating a just and peaceful future for @entity5 and @entity6 requires doing it the hard way			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of			0

@entity5 - @entity6 peace talks need support that comes from understanding of both sides
@entity227 : @entity6 sympathizers , know the @entity229 is an open wound
@entity227 : @entity5 sympathizers , stop dehumanizing @entity6 , accept their suffering
each side needs to look forward , stop arguing over who 's to blame , she says
