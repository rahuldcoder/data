@entity1 riot police swarmed a major bazaar wednesday in @entity3 as demonstrators launched protests against firebrand president @entity6 , blaming him for plummeting currency that 's leaving families across the country struggling			1
a day after @entity6 acknowledged that his country is taking a hit , and placed the blame largely on " the enemy 's " sanctions , crowds of protesters also took to the streets in another commercial area in the capital , shopkeepers said			1
they chanted slogans slamming @entity6 's regime and complained about the high prices of goods and food			1
riot police dispersed the crowd , a shopkeeper said			2
the semi-official @entity31 news agency reported two @entity33 tourists and some " agitators " were arrested by security forces			1
the @entity33 violated @entity1 law by gathering information about the protests , it said			1
the country 's supreme leader , ayatollah @entity42 , echoed @entity6 's position wednesday , saying that growing pressures are mainly aimed at making his country surrender , " but the @entity1 nation has and will never surrender to pressures and this has made the enemy furious , " the semi-official @entity41 news agency reported			1
the @entity51 and @entity52 have imposed numerous sanctions aimed at pressuring @entity3 into sitting down for international negotiations on its nuclear program			2
@entity58 spokeswoman @entity57 said the growing protests show that " clearly the @entity1 people are demanding better from their government and speaking out against the gross mismanagement of the economy and the situation in the country			1
" the @entity51 is " watching the situation very closely , " she said			1
the " sanctions that the international community has put on the government as a result of its lack of forthcomingness on its nuclear program are being felt on the ground , " she said			2

he said the country 's economy " has become a tool for psychological warfare			1

" he blamed " 22 ringleaders " who the country 's intelligence services have determined are causing tensions and manipulating currency			2
the president gave no details			0
but people who trade currency illegally have been increasingly concerned about a crackdown by @entity1 forces			1
months ago , an @entity1 man told @entity157 that with the country 's economic downfall , the only way for his sons to live a decent life was to fall in with influential people or make shady business deals -- such as trading foreign currency on the black market			1
but @entity6 focused the majority of his remarks on the @entity51 and the @entity169			1
@entity51 : @entity1 currency woes show sanctions working " there is a hidden war , a very pervasive and heavy warfare that is happening across the world directed towards @entity1 , " he said			1

several @entity1 told @entity157 wednesday about the financial struggles they 're facing			1
they spoke anonymously for security reasons			0
" the prices are amazing , " said an @entity1 entrepreneur , adding , " it 's crazy , it 's so high			1
" " people ca n't make sense out of this , " she added			2
" and they do n't know what 's going to happen next			0

they 're not going to sell you anything			0

' " " nobody knows whether this is for real , whether this is going to stay here , " he added			0
" and this uncertainty is causing a lot of panic			0
" @entity239 , an analyst with the @entity240 , says the sanctions " are designed to put sufficient pressure on the average @entity1 , " which could help trigger an uprising against the government -- or at least cause leaders to fear one			1
" sanctions are a form of economic warfare , " he said			2
though some sanctions against @entity1 have existed for decades , " we 've seen only 10 months of what i would call significant and severe economic pressure , " @entity239 said			1
but there 's no evidence the sanctions have compelled the @entity1 government to change its nuclear stance , analysts say			1
@entity6 , in his speech wednesday , denied suggestions that the measures could work			1
" they lie when they say sanctions are pressure on the government , " he insisted , adding that sanctions " are always a pressure on nations " -- meaning average citizens			0
" it 's a rock that the enemy has thrown			0
so what we should do ? we should pick up the rock and throw it at them			0
" @entity279 , national security analyst at the @entity280 , said sanctions must be " large scale and consistent " over time to be effective			0

" this is a duel and you find out just how effective you are over time			0
" @entity288 , founder and president of the @entity290 , said so far there is no sign of a shift in the government 's nuclear program			0

" any democratic government would have fallen by now			0
" @entity288 said he was skeptical that large - scale protests are in the cards			0
@entity1 " are not going to go out there and risk their lives for a change if they do n't know what the next thing is , " he said			1
