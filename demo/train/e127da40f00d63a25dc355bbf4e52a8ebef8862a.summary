-- he dreamed of being a tennis star , but it was not to be			0
instead , @entity4 had to settle for captaining his country on arguably the biggest sporting stage -- and attracting a cult following due to his distinctive facial hair			1
playing at the @entity9 is the fantasy of millions of football fans across the globe , and the hirsute @entity4 did it twice for @entity13			1
not bad for someone who did n't get serious about football until he was 15			0
" i would n't say it was my dream to play at the @entity9 , " the 36 - year - old tells @entity0 's human to @entity18			1
" i never really thought about it			0
i never thought about becoming a professional football player			0
" @entity4 spent his his formative years honing his skills on the tennis court , but he did n't get the chance to emulate the exploits of all - conquering compatriot @entity26 , who retired prematurely with 11 grand slam titles to his name before @entity4 reached the age of five			1
instead , by his mid-teens , he was looking for a new sporting love -- which he found kicking a ball around with his friends in his hometown of @entity35 , about 300 kilometers west of @entity13 's capital city @entity37			1
" both my parents are teachers in physical education so i 've grown up with all kinds of sports , " he explains			0
" for a couple of years there , i only played tennis			2
i actually did n't start playing football properly until i was about 14 , 15			0
" i just enjoy the physical side of it and i think it suits me , my physique , and also the mental aspect			0
" i feel it 's a privilege to be able to play a game on this level every week			2
it 's difficult to get everything out of your body in a normal life so i like that -- to be able to just release everything once a week			2
" a rock - solid center - back who has played in most of the top @entity65 leagues , his first @entity9 outing was in 2002 and then he captained @entity13 in @entity66 four years later			1
" being captain for @entity13 was special as well -- gives you that extra responsibility towards the team and the country , " he recalls			1
" i will probably say the best memory was when we beat @entity74 in @entity66			0
it felt like playing at home			0
i think there were 40,000 @entity79 fans at the big stadium in @entity81			0
" the whole buildup to that game , when we were on the bus on our way to the stadium , we saw all these fans walking from the city to the stadium and also the support we had there when we won the game			0
" the @entity79 finished second in their group -- which contained @entity74 , @entity91 and @entity92 -- but lost 2 - 0 in the second round against host @entity66 in @entity81			0
four years earlier @entity4 was part of the @entity13 team which also reached the second round of the 2002 @entity9 in @entity98 and @entity99 , this time beaten by @entity100 in a match decided by a " golden goal " in extra time			1
earlier in the tournament , @entity13 recorded an impressive 1 - 1 draw with football powerhouse @entity106			1
" it was fantastic , " says @entity4			2
" it 's probably my best experience as a tournament in 2002 , mainly because we did really well and i think that year we could 've gone all the way			2
" i thought we improved game by game and we were really unlucky to get beaten by @entity100 , but the whole experience ... it was only my second ( international ) tournament at the time so it was nice			0
" focusing on football after giving up tennis , @entity4 's footballing progress was swift			1
his talents were spotted by @entity123 , a club then playing in the @entity124 -- @entity13 's top division -- where he came under the guidance of @entity127 , a coach who is best known for being the assistant to former @entity91 and @entity130 manager @entity129			1
his performances during two seasons with @entity133 earned @entity4 a move to @entity37 's @entity135 , where he won the first silverware of his career as the club clinched the 1998 league title by two points			1
@entity4 left @entity13 in 1998 , swapping @entity37 for the idyllic @entity142 port of @entity143			1
he signed a three - year contract with @entity145 , hoping to help the club succeed in the @entity147			1
" they wanted me to adapt to @entity142 and learn the language before giving me the opportunity , " @entity4 says of his first months after the move			2
once he was given his chance though , @entity4 shined			2
his performances saw him linked with a number of more prestigious @entity142 clubs -- including @entity156 -- but instead he headed for @entity91			0
@entity158 adventure he was signed by @entity160 manager @entity159 in 2001 as a replacement for @entity162 , the @entity91 defender who had left the @entity164 club to join @entity165			2
@entity4 became a firm favorite at @entity167 , endearing himself to the fans , who would routinely chant , " there 's only one @entity4			1
" " that 's obviously where i spent the major part of my career			2
i spent seven years there and had a fantastic time , " he says			0
" we changed manager a lot of times , we changed the squad around , and we changed the training ground			0
every season was different so i learned a lot during my time there			0
" eventually he chose to move on , announcing in january 2008 that he had agreed to join top @entity185 club @entity184 the following season			2
but before he left @entity160 , @entity4 had a gift for the fans who had taken him to their hearts			2
he paid Â £ 40,000 ( $ 67,000 ) of his own money to give every @entity160 fan who attended the team 's final game of the 2007 - 08 season a replica shirt with the message " thanks 4 your support " on the back			2
@entity199 was @entity4 's shirt number			1
time in @entity201 the switch to @entity184 allowed @entity4 to play in the @entity203 , the pinnacle of @entity65 club football			1
" i was only there for one year but it was a fantastic experience , " he says			0
" i had a great time there and that was the first year i got to play in the @entity203 and that was a great experience			0
" playing for one of @entity213 's leading clubs also exposed @entity4 to new levels of pressure and expectation			1
" you learn there 's no hiding			0
whenever you play , wherever you play , there 's pressure -- from yourself obviously but also from the club and a lot of fans			2
i enjoyed that , i liked that and i learned you need to give 100 % wherever you are , whenever you play			0
" upon leaving @entity201 in 2009 , @entity4 embarked on a three - year stint with @entity227 in @entity228 before spending a year back in @entity142 with @entity229			1
he signed for @entity231 's @entity230 in 2013 , returning to @entity232 after 15 years spent traveling the continent			1
" i 'm almost back home in @entity13 after 15 - 20 years abroad and i feel everything is very similar to how it was when i left @entity13 a long time ago , " he says			1
" @entity237 both on and off the pitch , i would say , the way things work around football and also the way things work in and around the club -- even though many years has passed			0
" i feel it 's more similar to when i played back home in @entity135 or @entity133 , more similar to that than life in the @entity158 or @entity147 or @entity213 or @entity228			2
" end of an era @entity4 retired from international football following the 2012 @entity250 , the fourth time he had played at the continent 's showpiece event			1
he scored twice against @entity91 but could not prevent a 3 - 2 defeat which cost @entity13 a place in the quarterfinals			1
his country did not qualify for this year 's @entity9 in @entity257 , where the focus will be on the host nation -- which beat @entity13 in the 1958 final in the first of its record five triumphs			1
" i think that the @entity9 this year will be between a few teams -- @entity142 , @entity66 , @entity257 and @entity106 , " @entity4 predicts			1
" obviously a lot of attention will be on @entity257 players			0
" @entity4 's time in the spotlight is now fading , after a 17 - year professional career that has brought him financial security and a host of cherished experiences			1
with only one year remaining on his @entity230 contract , he 's determined to enjoy playing the game while he still can			1
" when i was younger , there were a lot of things on my mind , " he reflects			0
" you think about the future , about playing for your country in the future , you think about going to bigger teams , bigger leagues , making more money			0
" i think all of that , i 've left behind me and just focus on the football and enjoying the football			0
" one thing he has n't left behind is the iconic beard that makes him stand out on the football field -- it even has a @entity294 page dedicated to it			0
" at one point , i started growing a beard and i left it like that			0
maybe part laziness and i realized i kind of liked it , so i 've had it more or less almost throughout my whole career , " @entity4 says			1
" now , it 's probably a little bit less -- but it will grow bigger soon ! "			0
