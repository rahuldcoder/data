@entity0 -- a top @entity3 official has criticized @entity5 's claim that the six imprisoned leaders of the religious minority were held for security reasons and not because of their faith			1
president @entity11 's government has been accused of trying to eliminate the @entity3 community			1
@entity13 , the principal representative of the @entity14 to the @entity15 , called @entity5 's assertion " utterly baseless			1
" " the allegations are not new , and the @entity5 government knows well that they are untrue , " @entity13 said on wednesday , quoted in a news release issued by the @entity3 movement			1
" the documented plan of the @entity5 government has always been to destroy the @entity3 community , and these latest arrests represent an intensification of this plan			1
" @entity5 government spokesman @entity25 said the people were detained for " security issues " and not their faith , @entity5 's @entity29 said			1
@entity30 said on tuesday that the @entity3 were members of a group working together " against national interest			0
" " the group is an organized establishment linked to foreigners , the @entity36 in particular , " he said			0
the arrests of the six last week and another @entity3 leader in march sparked sharp condemnation by the @entity3 , the @entity40 , @entity41 , the @entity42 and humanitarian groups			0
the @entity3 say the latest arrests are part of a pattern of religious persecution since 1979 , when the monarchy of the @entity48 was toppled and an @entity29 republic was created in the predominantly @entity51 nation			0
the @entity3 say they have been killed , jailed and " otherwise oppressed " only because of their religion			0
" the best proof of this is the fact that , time and again , @entity3 have been offered their freedom if they recant their @entity3 beliefs and convert to @entity58 , an option few have taken , " @entity13 said			2
@entity13 said @entity5 's practice of connecting the group to @entity36 , the underlying political philosophy of the jewish state , was a " distortion " and an attempt to " stir animosity " among the @entity5 public			2
the @entity67 , which the movement refers to as its " spiritual and administrative heart , " is in the @entity72 / @entity71 area in northern @entity73 -- a location that predates the founding of the state of @entity73 since it was formed during the @entity78 's rule of @entity79			0
the @entity3 explain that their founder , @entity88 , " after a series of successive banishments from his native @entity5 , was exiled , with members of his family and a small band of his followers , to the @entity86 penal colony of @entity72 in 1868			2
" @entity13 said the @entity5 actions were the " most recent iteration in a long history of attempts to foment hatred by casting the @entity3 as agents of foreign powers , whether of @entity101 , the @entity102 , or the @entity40 and now @entity73 all of which are completely baseless			2
" @entity13 said the government 's philosophies are based largely on the idea that there can be " no prophet following @entity108 " and that the faith " poses a theological challenge to this belief			0
" they say @entity88 is regarded by @entity3 as " the most recent in the line of messengers of @entity115 that stretches back beyond recorded time and that includes @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity108			0
" the @entity3 -- regarded as the largest non-muslim religious minority in @entity5 -- say they have 5 million members across the globe , and about 300,000 in @entity5 .			1
