@entity0 -- president @entity3 's statement about the @entity6 military 's seizure of power is as telling for what he does n't say as for what he does : he does n't mention the word " coup			1
" he does n't call upon the military to restore power to " the democratically elected civilian government , " but rather to " a democratically elected civilian government			0
" in other words , it need not be deposed president @entity17 's			0
the thinking of the president and administration officials , according to a knowledgeable source , is that while the administration is not explicitly supporting the removal of @entity17 from power -- it expressly did not support the move -- it is seeking to push the @entity6 military in a direction			2
if the @entity3 administration were to use the word " coup , " it would have legal ramifications that would result in the end of @entity34 aid			1
if @entity37 officials pulled the plug completely , they would be removing themselves from the picture altogether			0
the priority for the @entity3 administration is to preserve some space while trying to contain a fluid and combustible situation , the source said			1
the message being conveyed publicly and privately is that @entity3 accepts that this happened and even sees the potential that it could turn out for the best , given @entity17 's autocratic rule			1
that said , the president is concerned that the military leaders and the acting leader might see the events as an opening to take on @entity17 and the @entity54 through excessive force			0
@entity3 's words are intended to put the onus on the military to show restraint and to uphold its pledge to hold parliamentary and presidential elections , the source said			2
notably , the president said he and his officials " are deeply concerned by the decision of the @entity6 armed forces to remove president @entity17 and suspend the @entity6 constitution " without suggesting that there would necessarily be any negative repercussions			0
potential repercussions are alluded to in @entity3 's statement , but never definitively threatened			2
the president said he had " directed the relevant departments and agencies to review the implications under @entity34 law for our assistance to the government of @entity6			2
" would the president suspend the $ 1.5 billion in annual assistance given to the @entity6 government ? he never says			0
the source says the message is that @entity34 action can escalate from reviewing to cutting off if need be , but that the @entity3 administration is prepared to continue to work with @entity6 military officials if they take this in the right direction			1
refraining from the arbitrary arrests of @entity54 members and its supporters would be part of that " right direction , " the source said			0
for all intents and purposes , this means that as far as the @entity3 administration is concerned , @entity17 is out of luck , and the ball is in the court of army chief gen. @entity102 @entity101 .			1

the @entity3 administration did not use the word " coup "
use of the word would have legal ramifications resulting in the end of @entity34 aid
the @entity34 priority is to preserve some space while trying to contain a combustible situation
