-- money , prestige and race are front and center in an ongoing controversy surrounding one of the most expensive prep schools in the country and its former student - body president			1
@entity10 was the first black female student president of @entity11 , an affluent academy for boarding and day students located in @entity14			1
this march , after @entity10 mocked her white male classmates on @entity16 , she claims she was asked to step down or face disciplinary action			1
according to reports , @entity10 took the first option and resigned under administrative pressure			2
the @entity16 photos that led to @entity10 's ouster are seemingly harmless : @entity10 is dressed in stereotypical preppy male clothing , holding a hockey stick and staring straight into the camera			2
but with added hashtags including " # confederate , " " @entity30 " and " # peakedinhighschool " some @entity27 students thought the pictures were offensive			1
" you 're the student body president , and you 're mocking and blatantly insulting a large group of the school 's male population , " one student commented on the photo			1
on the school 's @entity43 alumni page , comments included some visceral personal attacks calling @entity10 " a racist " and one post referring to her has a " miserable person " and " spoiled malcontent			1
" " the pc policies and diversity for the sake of diversity over the last fifteen years ... have precipitated this sort of event , " one commenter said			2
@entity10 acknowledged her post could make white students uncomfortable			1
" yes , i am making a mockery of the right - wing , confederate - flag hanging , openly misogynistic @entity61 , " @entity10 told @entity58			1
" if that 's a large portion of the school 's male population , then i think the issue is not with my bringing attention to it in a lighthearted way , but rather why no one has brought attention to it before			1
" @entity10 could not be reached for comment by @entity0 as of publication			2
posting the @entity16 photo was a response to fellow classmates ' concerns regarding her yearbook picture , @entity10 told @entity58			1
in the yearbook photo , she and 10 black friends raised their fists in the classic " black power " salute			1
@entity10 's point of view is not unfounded , according to other @entity27 graduates			2
@entity85 graduated from @entity11 in 2007 and recounted several instances of racism on campus , in an e-mail exchange with @entity0			2
in some cases racial slurs were directed at him , he said			2
" i was really weirded out by how flippantly ( racial slurs ) were used , " he said			0
other things on campus made him uncomfortable			0
" on my way to class and back , i passed by three confederate flags , " @entity85 said			1
@entity85 noted that , to his knowledge , those responsible for the flags were never punished			1
" the fact that @entity10 and friends were reprimanded for throwing up black power signs that made white students uncomfortable but these white students are never , to my knowledge , reprimanded for making black students uncomfortable is the definition of racism			1
" a school representative declined to comment on the presence of confederate flags on campus			1
in a statement , @entity11 said it " works hard to foster an inclusive , open and engaging atmosphere that gives all students opportunities to be heard , feel respected and succeed			0
" prior to the @entity16 photo , @entity10 was involved in several controversial incidents , according to @entity58			0
soon after @entity10 's election , @entity123 @entity122 told students she had received anonymous photographs that included evidence of marijuana usage and inappropriate tweets by @entity10			0
as detailed in an article in the @entity131 , the school newspaper , the tweets were found to be fabricated , and @entity10 apologized for the drug usage			1
the yearbook " salute " and @entity16 photo were the final straw			0
@entity10 was ousted as student - body president			1
@entity0 confirmed @entity10 has since graduated from @entity11			0
" i understand why i hurt people 's feelings , but i did n't become president to make sure rich white guys had more representation on campus , " she said			1
" let 's be honest			0
they 're not the ones that feel uncomfortable here			0
" other students disagree , and believe @entity11 serves all its students with integrity			0
@entity151 , a 2012 @entity27 alumna now at @entity152 , posted a response to the @entity58 article titled , " in response to poor reporting			0
" " while i may never know what @entity10 endured , i do know that @entity27 tried to shape us to be the best people we could be , " she wrote			0
" students were constantly exposed to current events and controversial issues because @entity11 wanted us to realize that there are still many problems in the world			0
" @entity151 placed blame with the individual students who broke the school 's honor code , including @entity10			2
" while @entity10 should not have instagrammed that photo because she was acting as a leader , the students quoted in the article should not have made such strong statements against her			0
" even @entity85 , the 2007 alumnus who remembers instances of racism on the @entity27 campus , wanted to stress the kind nature of some faculty members			0
@entity85 , who is openly gay , says that during his time there , staff went out of their way to make sure he felt comfortable			0
one adviser for the @entity186 added " that 's so gay " to the swear jar to limit bullying			0
" i felt so safe , " @entity85 said			0
" i will never forget that as long as i live			0
" even so , he stands with @entity10			0
" being comfortable enough to complain about another student by name in high school is the definition of privilege , " he said			1
" i think that students of color at @entity27 stood so much more to lose when complaining about prejudice and discomfort than white students did			2

first black , female student president removed for mocking white classmates at @entity14 prep school
student says she only mocking white , misogynist culture of the school
