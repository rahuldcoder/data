@entity0 -- a long time ago , by technology standards , in this very galaxy , the founders of video game developer @entity3 received a phone call			1
it was from @entity9 , then the president of @entity11 ' @entity10			0
in the early 2000s , @entity3 happened to be looking for its next big adventure when @entity9 proposed they work on the first - ever " @entity14 " role - playing game			1
@entity3 jumped at the opportunity , and it led to a pair of the most celebrated " @entity14 " console games , called " @entity19			1
" on tuesday , the studio released " @entity14 : the @entity21 , " the latest and most ambitious product of this so - far decade - long partnership			1
in this sprawling , much - anticipated computer game , millions of @entity25 , bounty hunters and other familiar warriors from the movies can roam and battle on their home planets , and then hop in spaceships to travel the galaxy			0
the " @entity21 " games are set thousands of years before the events in the movies , when @entity37 and @entity38 battled for galactic dominion			2
at the partnership 's inception , @entity10 gave @entity3 the option to create games with characters from the films or set during another time , said @entity46 , a @entity3 founder who is now the general manager of its various studios			1
executives chose the latter so that the @entity3 team could exercise its own creativity			2
the creative juices flooded for " the @entity21 , " which has planets full of monsters and gems , and about 1,000 actors reading 260,000 lines of dialogue for characters in the game			1
to build this massively multiplayer online game , @entity3 has been hiring industry veterans to work at its @entity66 , @entity65 , studio over the past few years			1
" it 's kind of like building a whole bunch of [ console games ] and then building an @entity71 service , " @entity46 said			0
" this is definitely the biggest game that @entity3 has ever built			1
" it is also the biggest that @entity75 , the @entity76 game publishing giant , has ever funded , analysts have said			2
@entity75 has spent between $ 100 million and $ 300 million , according to analysts ' estimates reported in @entity79			0
@entity75 acquired @entity3 in 2007 , when work on " the @entity21 " was already under way			1
the project , and the trust @entity3 had earned from @entity10 , played a role , @entity46 said in an interview here after ringing the @entity88 opening bell on tuesday , flanked by people dressed in @entity91 and @entity92 costumes			2
still , @entity10 reviews all of @entity3 's concepts and designs , and occasionally overrules them , @entity46 said			1
around the time of the @entity75 acquisition , @entity96 's massively multiplayer online game , " @entity101 , " was skyrocketing in popularity , while @entity105 's " @entity104 " faltered , leaving an opening for its replacement			2
( @entity75 published " galaxies " in @entity109 , but the game 's worldwide servers were shut down for good a week ago			1
) in addition to the initial $ 60 price tag , " the @entity21 " costs $ 15 per month , same as " @entity101			2
" ( the price goes down a dollar or two when committing to longer subscriptions			0
) the game companies justify these fees by citing the expenses of internet server upkeep , and of delivering new missions and items on a regular basis			0
this idea of constantly updating a game , even years after its debut , is new for @entity3 because it has never made a game of this type before			1
the team has implemented a suite of data - analytics services so that it can review how people play and then tailor updates , @entity46 said			0
@entity3 will need to stay attentive to players ' demands over time			0
a few people who started playing weeks ago during the beta period have already reached the maximum level of 50			0
@entity3 is not concerned that its gargantuan product has already been defeated			0
there are always some sleepless diehards , and developers can not pay attention only to them , @entity3 co-founder @entity139 said in an interview			0
already , @entity3 execs have begun discussing new features they plan to add for teams and player battles , which may be released in quarterly updates , according to @entity46			1
execs are eager because @entity3 has been preparing for this type of game for more than a decade			1
" we thought about doing this back in the early years of @entity3 , " said @entity46 , who started the studio with @entity139 in 1995			2
" we wanted to have all of the best - of - breed features of any mmo out there			0
" " the @entity21 " passed the first test at launch			0
the servers remained steady under the initial surge			0
but will the force stay with them ?			0

@entity3 says " the @entity21 " is the biggest game it 's ever built
the " @entity14 " game has 260,000 lines of dialogue
studio heads are already mulling over which new items they *'ll* add
