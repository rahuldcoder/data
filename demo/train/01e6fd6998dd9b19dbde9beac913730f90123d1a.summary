-- @entity2 parents are suing their son 's school , alleging it watched him through his laptop 's webcam while he was at home and unaware he was being observed			1
@entity8 and @entity9 of @entity10 are suing the @entity11 , its board of directors and the superintendent			0
the parents allege the district unlawfully used its ability to access a webcam remotely on their son 's district - issued laptop computer			1
the lawsuit seeking class - action status was filed wednesday in @entity23			2
the suit said that on november 11 , an assistant principal at @entity26 told the plaintiffs ' son that he was caught engaging in " improper behavior " in his home and it was captured in an image via the webcam			1
according to the @entity37 ' complaint , neither they nor their son , @entity35 , were informed of the school 's ability to access the webcam remotely at any time			1
it is unclear what the boy was doing in his room when the webcam was activated or if any punishment was given out			0
@entity48 , a spokesman for the @entity11 , said the district would only remotely access a laptop if it were reported to be lost , stolen or missing			1
@entity48 said if there were such a report , the district first would have to request access from its technology and security department and receive authorization			2
then it would use the built - in security feature to take over the laptop and see whatever was in the webcam 's field of vision , potentially allowing it to track down the missing computer			1
@entity48 said parents and students were not explicitly told about this built - in security feature			2
to receive the laptop , the family had to sign an " acceptable - use " agreement			0
to take the laptop home , the family also would have to buy insurance for the computer			0
in an " acceptable - use " agreement , the families are made aware of the school 's ability to " monitor " the hardware , he said , but it stops short of explicitly explaining the security feature			2
he termed that a mistake			0
@entity48 added that mistakes might be made when combining technology and education in a cutting - edge way			0
all 2,300 students at the district 's two high schools were offered laptops to " enhance opportunities for ongoing collaboration and ensure that all students have 24/7 access to school - based resources , " according to a message on the superintendent 's web site , which the suit quoted			1
@entity48 said the district is proud of the laptop program and the ability to close the technology gap between students who have computers at home and those who do n't			2
but he acknowledged schools will have to take a step back to re-evaluate the policies and procedures surrounding the program			0
the @entity112 of @entity2 is n't involved in the litigation , but its director , @entity114 , criticized the school district 's action			1
" neither police nor school officials can enter a private home , physically or electronically , without an invitation or a warrant			0
the school district 's clandestine electronic eavesdropping violates constitutional privacy rights , intrudes on parents ' right to raise their children and may even be criminal under state and federal wiretapping laws , " @entity114 said " ... @entity131 's ' 1984 ' is an overused metaphor , but it applies here in spades			1
part of the school officials ' punishment should be to retake ninth - grade civics class			0
" @entity140 , a senior staff attorney for the @entity141 who specializes in electronic privacy , also said the school may have broken federal wire - tapping laws			0
he called the school district 's action " foolish and dangerous , " saying the matter could prove to be a warning to other districts			1
multiple requests for further comment from the @entity37 ' attorney , @entity151 of @entity152 , went unanswered .			0
