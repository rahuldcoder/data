@entity0 -- the @entity2 tuesday said it is launching a " full review " of an incident in which the agency posted on the @entity7 a sensitive manual outlining screening procedures for law enforcement officers , diplomats , prisoners , federal air marshals and others			1
in a statement tuesday night , the @entity2 sought to minimize the impact of the unintentional release -- calling the document " outdated , " " unclassified " and unimplemented -- while saying that it took the incident " very seriously , " and " took swift action " when it was discovered			1
congressional critics , meanwhile , lambasted the agency and called for an independent investigation			1
" undoubtedly , this raises potential security concerns across our transportation system , " @entity25 chairman rep. @entity24 , @entity26 , and rep. @entity27 , @entity28 , wrote in a letter to @entity2 acting administrator @entity30			2
sen. @entity35 , @entity36 , the ranking member of the @entity37 , called the release of the information " shocking " and reckless			2
" this manual provides a road map to those who would do us harm , " she said			0
at issue is a 93 - page manual giving instruction to airport screeners on how to screen individuals			0
it also gives details on how screening is conducted and the limitations of x-ray machines			0
the @entity2 posted the manual on a federal business opportunities web site that provides information for government contractors and redacted sensitive parts			1
but the redacted information was not properly protected , and the information was restored by people familiar with the computer program			1
the @entity2 said the posted manual -- dated may 28 , 2008 , with an implementation date of june 30 , 2008 -- was never implemented and has been revised six times , although it did not elaborate on the extent of the revisions			1
" while the document does demonstrate the complexities of checkpoint security , it does not contain information related to the specifics of everyday checkpoint screening procedures , " the @entity2 said tuesday			2
" the traveling public should be assured that appropriate measures have been put in place to ensure the continued implementation of a strong security screening program , " it said			0
the @entity2 said it removed the report as soon as it learned of the problem			0
but it was too late			0
the full , un-redacted version of the report appeared on at least one web site on sunday , and was even more widely distributed on tuesday .			0
