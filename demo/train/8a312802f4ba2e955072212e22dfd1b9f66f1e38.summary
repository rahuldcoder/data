@entity7 was pronounced dead at 10:28 a.m. et , said @entity11 , spokeswoman for the @entity12			1
the execution went as scheduled , she said , with " no problems whatsoever			1
" @entity7 had exhausted his legal appeals and gov. @entity16 earlier denied the 41 - year - old prisoner 's clemency petition			1
@entity7 murdered two college students in 1986			1
asked if he had any final words , @entity19 quoted @entity7 as saying , " you have n't paid attention to anything i 've had to say for the past 22 years , so why would you think that i would think you 're going to pay attention to what i have to say now ? " earlier tuesday , the @entity4 rejected the stay @entity7 's attorneys had sought , along with the opportunity to address the larger constitutional claims over when a convicted person is medically unfit for capital punishment			1
the court was also asked to review whether @entity3 's lethal injection procedures amount to cruel and unusual punishment			0
@entity7 's lawyers maintained that at 5 - foot - 7 and 267 pounds , he was " morbidly obese " and had gained about 70 pounds since he was imprisoned at age 19			2
prison food and confinement in his cell for 23 hours a day , limiting his opportunities for exercise , contributed to his weight problem , his legal team argued			0
@entity7 also contended regular medication he took for migraines would weaken the effectiveness of an anesthetic used in the three - drug cocktail administered during execution			1
he said his veins were weakened because of his health issues , and the lethal drugs would constitute cruel and unusual punishment			0
a federal appeals court ruled thursday that @entity7 waited too long raise the medical issues , saying he " knew of and could have filed suit over vein access prior to july 2005			2
" @entity3 does not serve a " last meal , " as death - row inmates are given the opportunity to eat breakfast before a scheduled execution , @entity19 told @entity1			1
but on monday night , she said , @entity7 ate a " special meal " consisting of a t - bone steak , hash browns , french fries , four eggs over easy , onion rings , four pieces of toast , a pint of @entity74 ice cream , @entity75 and bear claw pastries			1

@entity89 received a life sentence because of his age			0
@entity7 tried to escape from death row in 2005 , when corrections officials said he constructed a ladder from magazines and bed sheets in an effort to scale the barrier around an outdoor recreation area			1
at an august clemency hearing , @entity124 , brother of one of the victims , said , " our family has never gotten an apology from @entity7			2
we 've gotten blatant lies and excuses			0
is an apology too much to ask ? how could he commit such an heinous act and not feel regret ? " however , @entity7 's lawyer , @entity133 , said his client is sorry for his crimes			2
the high court has not offered clear guidelines on what medical standards need to be met before an inmate is eligible for death			2
but in a case five years ago , the justices allowed inmates to at least make a claim that their specific physical or medical issues could be cause to block an execution			2
the high court had sided with a convicted @entity151 killer who claimed his veins were so damaged from years of drug abuse that executioners might have to cut deeply into his flesh to administer the deadly drugs			0
writing for the unanimous court in that case , then - justice @entity157 said the court was not going to " open the floodgates to all manner of method - of - execution challenges , " as @entity151 feared			2
" our holding is extremely limited			0
" that inmate is still on death row			2
@entity168 of the @entity169 , a data - resource group that opposes capital punishment , said the @entity4 indicated that " how you 're going to be executed is a civil rights matter , the same as if you were discriminated on the basis of race or gender or something like that			1
" a @entity180 killer was given a reprieve in 1994 after claiming he was too obese to hang			0
@entity183 at one time was more than 425 pounds , but weight - loss surgery in prison had reduced that to 275 pounds over the years			0
