-- in a few terrible seconds , teen star @entity1 made his attorney @entity3 's job a heck of a lot harder			1
@entity1 , who was arrested in @entity6 on thursday for drunken driving , resisting arrest and driving without a valid license , decided it would be a good idea to spill his guts to the @entity14			1
according to @entity6 police chief @entity19 , during his arrest , @entity1 " made some statements that he had consumed some alcohol , and that he had been smoking marijuana and consumed some prescription medication , " before getting behind the wheel of a yellow @entity22			1
@entity1 arrested on drunken driving , resisting arrest charges on the surface , this could look like @entity1 was just being an honest guy , admitting to his wrongdoings			1
but look a little further , and you 'll see a young man who has done the worst possible thing a defendant in any case could do			2
and in doing that , he 's also doing the state 's job for them			1
@entity1 should have just shut up			1
the great thing about the @entity40 justice system is that it is based on an adversarial process that requires the state to actually prove your guilt with evidence			2
guess whose job it is to gather that evidence ? that 's right , it 's the job of the state -- in this case , the state of @entity55			1
the defendant is entitled to a presumption of innocence			0
the defendant -- nor his attorney -- does n't have to prove a thing			2
the defense attorney only needs to raise reasonable doubt to the state 's version of the story			1
where @entity1 went wrong was voluntarily handing over evidence of his own guilt by admitting to criminal behavior , and therefore assisting in handing the prosecutor a conviction on a silver platter			1
police report details @entity1 arrest the moment @entity1 was placed under arrest , he was read those words that we hear on every procedural cop drama on television : " you have the right to remain silent			1
" all @entity1 had to do was shut his mouth			1
it makes no sense why more defendants do n't use this precious liberty			0
contrary to popular belief , keeping your lips sealed is not an indication of guilt			0
it 's just plain smart			2
it gives your defense lawyer a much greater chance of success , because his client is n't participating in his own prosecution			0
when you are fighting the state and their plentiful resources of investigators , detectives , crime labs and prosecutors , the last thing a defense lawyer needs is his own client working against him			1
@entity3 is not happy with his client right now			0
defending a client against an impaired driving charge is no easy task			0
the public interest in keeping impaired drivers off the road is understandably great			0
no one wants to see our society in harm 's way because of irresponsible drivers			0
however , the integrity of our justice system requires that every defendant get an opportunity to have his guilt or innocence determined according to the evidence against him			0
by making statements against his own interests , @entity1 actually helps to undermine the whole process			2
his lawyer 's job is not to get him " off			0
" @entity3 's task is to hold the state accountable to its burden of providing evidence -- beyond a reasonable doubt -- that @entity1 is in fact guilty of the crimes charged against him			1
by failing to perform the simple task of remaining silent , @entity1 has done the exact thing @entity147 rights are designed to prevent -- he has incriminated himself			2
unlike instances where outside evidence can be refuted by the defense as speculative or circumstantial , self - incrimination is incredibly tough to refute because the defendant himself provided it			0
unless you want to attack the credibility of your own client , the defense lawyer is in an awful position			0
sure , defense lawyers can try to suppress the statements , but without facts to support coercion , this can also be a tall order			0
the right to remain silent is a gift from our @entity167 ( from the @entity169 , to be exact )			0
so if you are ever in as an unfortunate situation as @entity1 found himself in early thursday morning , listen to the police officer 's instructions , cooperate fully , call your attorney -- and keep your mouth shut			1
remember , you have that right			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178			2

teen star @entity1 was arrested early thursday morning
defense attorney @entity178 says he made a mistake when he talked to the police
she argues in doing so , he helped the state 's case against him
