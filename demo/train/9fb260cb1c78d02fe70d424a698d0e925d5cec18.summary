@entity0 -- @entity2 is a bus driver in @entity0 who started feeding the hungry in @entity4 five years ago , using food that would otherwise have been thrown away			1
and that 's how he discovered a secret -- the power of sharing			2
" people are telling me , ' @entity2 , you have no money , you do all this and get nothing back			1
' and i say i have a checking account full of smiles			1
" @entity2 has been recognized as a @entity19 @entity18 in 2009 and received the @entity20 from president @entity21			1
@entity2 spoke wednesday with @entity1 's @entity24			1
here is an edited transcript			2
@entity1 : what is it that made you decide to do what you do every day ? @entity2 : in the beginning it was to try to avoid wasting food in the garbage			1
but then i realized it was like a mission from @entity38 for my family			2
that 's how we see it			2
i was working in a summer camp on @entity44 and i was waiting for the kids on the bus , and across the street was a food processing plant			1
i saw a couple come out with a lot of food , and it was good food			1
i asked them about it and they said they had to throw it out every friday			2
but it was good food and i asked them about it , if they could give it to me because i knew someone would want it			1
so in @entity66 i saw people waiting on the corner , and i asked them what they were doing and they said they had no money for food			1
so i called my mom and i said i had people to give the food to			1
at first we brought food for eight guys			1
and a few days later i saw a few of them on the corner and i asked them about it and they said they sleep under the bridge			2
that 's when i decided to bring them food [ every day ]			1
and the first week it was eight guys , and the next week 24 and so on			2
take the @entity91 challenge : be an everyday hero @entity1 : are you out there every day ? what do you provide for people ? @entity2 : in these 6 Â½ years we 've been doing it , i 've missed one day because of a snowstorm			1
and we 've distributed 121,000 meals over the years , might be more			2
but every day we make 120 to 140 meals			1
for the last few months , every piece of bread i get i bring in the morning with soda or water that i buy			2
besides meals , we provide hot coffee , tea , a piece of cake and sometimes my mom makes chicken soup			2
and when i have money i provide fruit			2
when i have a budget , when winter is here , i provide caps , underwear , winter hats , scarves , boots			2
and this time of the year , on the website , i ask for coat donations			0
i need about 100 coats because these guys sleep on the street			0
@entity1 : why is what you do important today ? @entity2 : because i have a family at my house and i have a second family out there			1
and that 's about 130 to 140 guys			0
and there 's always a line out there			0
and the economy is not good right now , and those who have a place to stay have to choose between a place to live and food			1
and when we 're there they have something to eat			0
at least we provide a little something , and the only thing we ask in return is a smile			0
if you hand a meal to someone who has n't eaten anything in the last 20 hours and they smile , you know you did something good			0
@entity1 : how much food do you cook in the space of a week ? @entity2 : in a week it 's hard to say , but for example , tomorrow we 're going to cook 22 pounds of rice , 15 pounds of pasta , 10 pounds of frozen vegetables , 10 pounds of onions , 8 to 10 pounds of peppers , 60 pounds of chicken , we do that through the oven			1
my mom , she 's the one who creates the menu and every day we change the menu			0
@entity1 : what was it like to become a @entity18 and what has your life been like since ? @entity2 : to become a @entity18 , being nominated , it 's a great honor for me , for my family and for my country [ @entity184 ]			1
so they know -- i had the chance to be there for almost a month and when i went into a neighborhood and people knew , or even here in @entity0 , people recognize me			0
and it helped me around the world			0
one example , there was a teacher in @entity197 and she e-mailed me saying she wanted to start a small meal program in their town because of my story			0
and there was a little girl in @entity204 , i think she 's 8 , after @entity18 , she saw the show and the next weekend she went out with her friends and family and sold brownies and lemonade and made $ 25 and sent it to me with a note saying she was touched by my efforts			1
@entity1 : are you planning on expanding your efforts beyond @entity4 ? @entity2 : yeah , we already did			1
right now , about a month ago , three volunteers they 're doing breakfast in @entity218 and two small towns in @entity44			0
and in @entity220 , @entity221 , they 're starting a meal program and they 're opening one in @entity225 with sandwiches and water			0
i 'm with them and they 're helping me out			0
@entity1 : you received the @entity233 @entity232 from president @entity21 this year -- what was that like and what did that mean to you ? @entity2 : that was a great honor			1
why , because not that many people have a chance to go to the @entity241 invited by the president of the @entity233			2
and he told me i did a great job and to continue doing what i 'm doing			0
today president @entity21 wants to shake your hand and tell you not to give up your mission			1
@entity1 : who is your biggest inspiration ? @entity2 : my mom			1
i always say my mom is my hero			0
because she taught me how to share			0
she told me if you share you 're ok with @entity38			0
@entity1 : what would you say to people who are trying to figure out a way that they can give back to their community ? @entity2 : if you share , share anything you have you 're not using like clothes , toys , share it to make other people happy			1
people in this country cook more than they need and two days later it goes from the refrigerator to the garbage			0
if you see someone standing on the corner and have $ 2 , buy them a cup of coffee and a piece of bread			0
i 'm doing it seven days a week , but just do it once in a while and you 'll feel what i feel			0
and when that person is smiling at you you 'll know you 're doing something good			0
do it from the inside			0
sharing is a beautiful thing			0
think of me , i 'm a regular union worker , bus driver and i 'm trying to change the lives of the hungry			1
and imagine if everyone around the world got together to change the lives of the hungry			0
imagine if they helped once in a while , you 'd see a lot of change			0
so share , it 's a beautiful thing .			0
