-- a group of @entity3 trained in crisis - rapid response are moving to a base in southern @entity6 due to concerns over continuing unrest in northern @entity9 , the @entity1 said wednesday			1
" we are doing this as a contingency because we believe the security situation in @entity9 is deteriorating to a point where there could be threats , " @entity1 spokesman col. @entity10 told reporters			1
" they will be there until we are satisfied that there is a little bit less unrest in the region			0
" just under 200 @entity3 from the @entity25 unit based in @entity26 , @entity27 , were moved to the @entity28 in @entity29 this week at the request of the @entity31 , according to defense officials			1
" this is part of our new normal , " @entity10 said , " where we have added flexibility to combatant commanders and given them the ability to move forces around and have ready forces available in case of regional contingencies			0
" in addition to the @entity3 , there were two kc - 130s and four @entity46 tilt - rotor aircraft that were also part of the forward deployment to @entity49			1
while the focus of the mission is to be ready to react to the current threat environment emanating from northern @entity9 , the force would be ready to deploy to nearby @entity54 where @entity54 forces are trying to dismantle the most lethal of @entity57 's affiliate groups			2
" the focus is unquestionably the protection of embassies no question about it , but it 's a contingency force , " @entity10 told reporters			0
" these are @entity3 capable of conducting any mission given to them			2
" two @entity67 personnel assigned to the @entity68 in @entity69 , @entity54 , killed two armed militants last month who had attempted to kidnap them @entity0 reported earlier this week			0
there was also considerable criticism over the lack of any military rapid response leveled at the @entity77 administration following the september 2012 attack on the @entity67 diplomatic compound in @entity80 , @entity81 , in which four @entity67 were killed			0
the @entity1 says the move is unrelated to the operation underway in @entity84 to rescue more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by the @entity87 militant group @entity86			1
officials continue to maintain there is no intention to put @entity67 forces inside @entity84 for the purposes of a rescue effort			2
the @entity3 deployed to @entity29 are part of an approximate force of 800 based in @entity26 , and trained to mobilize quickly in response to a variety of crises in the region			0
the unit assisted in the evacuation of @entity67 embassy personnel in @entity103 last year as the security situation in the country deteriorated .			1
