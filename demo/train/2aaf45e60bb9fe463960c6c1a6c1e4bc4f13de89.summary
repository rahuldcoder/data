-- a soccer whistle - blower has criticized @entity12 's " culture of self - protection " after the world governing body rejected her claim over a breach of confidentiality as the @entity9 bidding saga rumbled on			1
" @entity19 be to any other person who cares enough to risk personal safety to report @entity12 corruption , " said @entity13 , who was in charge of international media relations for the @entity17 bid until 2010 , in a public statement			2
@entity23 along with another whistle - blower -- @entity26 @entity25 -- gave evidence to @entity29 lawyer @entity28 , who has investigated the bidding process surrounding the 2018 and 2022 @entity31			1
the women claim @entity28 ensured they would have anonymity in his investigative report -- and that he broke his promise			0
it 's a report that has become mired in controversy after @entity39 judge @entity38 -- @entity12 's independent ethics adjudicator -- published a summary of the evidence the @entity29 had collated			1
the two women insist that assurances were given to them both in private and public that they would not be compromised after agreeing to give evidence " through a sense of natural justice and a desire to bring closure to a long running chapter in our lives			0
" the women were not identified by name , but they contend they were " clearly identifiable " in the summary of @entity28 's report			1
however , @entity12 's disciplinary committee said tuesday there " were no grounds to justify the opening of disciplinary proceedings " given " the breach of confidentiality claim had no substance			1
" referring to @entity38 's summary , @entity12 said ; " no names were mentioned in the statement and any information provided was of a general nature			0
thus , there was no divulgence of any information of a confidential nature			0
" @entity12 added that @entity28 " in his letter to @entity78 chairman @entity77 , concluded that the complaints by the participants in the investigation were without merit and that , as far as he was concerned , there had been no infringements by @entity38			2
" @entity12 's ruling drew an incredulous response from @entity23			2
" the conclusion of the @entity90 dismissing my complaint against @entity92 for breaching my confidentiality is a transparent avoidance of a clear violation of its own rules , " she said			1
" i cooperated with mr. @entity28 's investigation for over two - and - a - half years under a clear , unqualified promise of confidentiality			1
he asked me for my confidentiality and repeatedly promised me mine			0
" i kept my promise			0
the @entity78 's avoidance of this undisputable violation is emblematic of its culture of self - protection			1
" while admitting she had made public statements in the past , @entity23 insisted they were made " long before i entered into a confidentiality agreement with mr. @entity28			0
" i made no public statements during the entire period of mr. @entity28 's investigation			2
" i relied on @entity12 's promise of confidentiality and continued to honor my promise until @entity92 published his ' summary			1
' " my recent public statements have only been made after @entity92 's identification of me in blatant violation of @entity12 confidentiality rules			1
" on @entity122 , @entity23 posted an explanation @entity12 had sent her , which seemed at odds with the organization 's media release explaining why it had dismissed her complaint , given the letter suggested she was not entitled to complain as she was no longer working in football			2
former head of corporate affairs in the @entity136 2022 bid mersiades was equally critical of @entity12			0
" @entity12 is nothing if not predictable , and has today surpassed itself in obfuscation and deflection , " @entity137 said in a public statement			0
" these issues are no longer just about winning bids from @entity144 and @entity17 and losing bids , including @entity136			0
it is about @entity12 and the bid process that lent itself to abuse			0
" in @entity12 's world , there is no room for ordinary fans			2
@entity12 's world is littered with corruption , mismanagement and self - interest			1
" the real football world -- the many millions of players and billions of fans -- deserve a better @entity12 , one that is governed by people who make decisions and take action in a transparent manner and who are held accountable in the best interests of the sport and civil society			0
" will a new , independent candidate stand - up to depose the president and build a new @entity12 ? " @entity38 's report cleared @entity144 and @entity17 , who will stage the 2018 and 2022 events respectively , of wrongdoing and instead was critical of rival bidders @entity173 and @entity136			2
soon after its publication , @entity28 said the 42 - page summary contained " numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations , " as he too lodged an appeal with @entity12 's appeals committee			1
however , on tuesday @entity12 declared @entity28 's appeal " not admissible			1
" " the said statement about the report on the inquiry into the 2018 - 2022 @entity9 bidding process does not constitute a decision and as such is neither legally binding nor appealable , " said @entity12			0
" mr. @entity28 has just received the decision and is reviewing it , " said a spokesman for the @entity29 lawyer			1
" we have no further comment at this time			0
