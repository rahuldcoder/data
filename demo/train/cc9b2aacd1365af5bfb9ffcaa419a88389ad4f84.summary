hoof by hoof , @entity1 's family of horses crest the hill , kicking up dust , treading over stones and packed dirt			1
it 's another 70 - degree day in central @entity9			1
in the dead of winter , there 's not a cloud in sight			1
and there 's no rain in the forecast			1
fifty horses trot on @entity1 's 300 - acre spread outside of @entity19 , part of a vast valley that 's a farming and ranching hub to the nation			1
" every horse out here i 've raised , but for the exception of two , " @entity1 declares			2
his herd sips from a water trough , an oasis that 's suddenly taken on greater meaning			1
the surrounding hills show brown soil where there should be lush , green pasture			2
that 's because a historic disaster is unfolding : @entity9 is facing perhaps its worst drought since record - keeping began a century ago , @entity9 gov. @entity37 proclaimed this month			1
at the center of this ongoing catastrophe are farmers and ranchers like @entity1 , pushed to their financial limits			2
" normally , it 'd be raining and we 'd have grass growing , " @entity1 remarks			0
" the grass is basically all gone			0
" there 's nothing on the ground for @entity1 's animals to eat			1
winter is @entity9 's wet season , but it has n't rained on @entity1 's ranch in unincorporated @entity57 , near @entity58 , since december 7 , 2013			1
even on that day , just a few drops fell -- exactly 0.15 inches -- according to @entity60 , cooperative program manager at the @entity61			0
in fact , the area 's rainfall for 2013 was 3.01 inches , compared with an average year of 11.5 inches			1
@entity1 is now teetering on the brink of monetary collapse -- like many other ranchers and farmers in @entity9 's @entity69 , a breadbasket to the country as it stretches most of the state 's length roughly from @entity74 to @entity75			1
" i borrowed money -- i hate to even say that -- but i recently borrowed money to buy hay , " the proud rancher says			0
with hay prices on the rise because of the drought , @entity1 spends $ 800 to 1,000 a week on feed			1
that 's money that he does n't have			1
" i do n't really have much of a choice			0
that 's the way i look at it			1
" even so , his horses have cantered to better days			1
" some of them have dropped off a little bit in weight , " @entity1 says , taking a look at a mare whose ribs are beginning to show			0
" they would be fat if there was rain			0
" @entity1 has now decided that he must sell some of his horses			1
" i hate to get rid of them ... but it 's time , " he says			1
what 's causing this strange weather pattern ? financial toll the exact financial impact of the historic drought in @entity9 -- as well as a moderate to extreme drought throughout the @entity104 -- has yet to be calculated by state and federal officials or farming and ranching associations			1
but the financial blow could be in the billions of dollars , especially if the 2012 national drought is any indication			1
that disaster cost the country $ 30 billion , according to the @entity114			1
in the @entity69 's agriculture sector alone , the potential impact could exceed $ 1 billion in 2014 unless relief is provided , according to the @entity118			1
already , about 200,000 of 600,000 acres of prime farmland in @entity19 and @entity121 wo n't be planted this year because of the drought , the district said			1
that fallow land amounts to about 312 square miles			0
some federal relief is uncertain because @entity125 has n't been able to pass a farm bill since last year			1
federal officials are seeking a bill that would provide retroactive disaster assistance to livestock producers who 've been forced to thin their herds " to the lowest level in decades " because of the long - term drought , according to the @entity136 @entity135			1
@entity125 has been divided on a proposed bill 's food stamp and dairy pricing programs , said @entity140 , a vice president with the @entity141			1
the governor 's drought emergency , which included the entire state , wo n't help ranchers much because the measure allows water agencies to move water from northern to southern @entity9 , unless those cattlemen are located in a benefiting water district , @entity140 said			1
" this is by far the worst drought that we 've had , and in terms of ranchers , it 's the worst drought since the ' 70s and some say it 's worst than that , " @entity140 said			1
" if they have to sell cows , it will be extremely devastating for them			1
but they will work through it and come back			0
the people do n't quit			0
" federal officials also fear ranchers going bust overnight			0
" that 's why we keep pushing daily for @entity125 to get something done , " said @entity136 @entity135 spokeswoman @entity171			2
weirdly warm , dry winters spur bears to stop hibernating , start eating horses as family @entity9 's fields and tree crops -- which provide half of the nation 's fruits , nuts and vegetables -- are deteriorating			1
the state holds 80,500 farms and ranches , which together generate more than $ 100 billion in economic activity , according to the @entity190 the bad turn in nature has forced @entity1 to find other ways to keep his horses alive on his ranch about 200 miles north of @entity196			1
every day , he fills his truck with hay purchased through a retailer , and drives into the dry pasture to feed his herd			0
he gives a loud whistle , and they come running			0
" there are a whole lot of people like me			0
some of them are hurting worse than i am , " he said			0
to this life - long horse trainer and rancher , horses are n't just a business -- it 's lifestyle and family			1
" hey , little girl , " he says to a chestnut mare who approaches his side			0
" it 's pretty hard			2
sometimes you do n't have any choice			0
you do n't have to be too smart to figure out this is what i need to do			0
" it 's on the verge of very desperate " in wednesday 's state of the state address , @entity37 underlined the need to cut back on water resources			2
he 's already called for a voluntary 20 % conservation effort statewide			2
" right now , it is imperative that we do everything possible to mitigate the effects of the drought			2
we need everyone in every part of the state to conserve water			0
we need regulators to rebalance water rules and enable voluntary transfers of water , and we must prepare for forest fires , " @entity37 said			0
" among all our uncertainties , weather is one of the most basic			0
we ca n't control it			0
we can only live with it , and now we have to live with a very serious drought of uncertain duration , " he said			1
those who make their living off the land and its animals are desperate for relief from the parched conditions			0
@entity258 runs @entity259 , dedicated to the rehabilitation and placement of orphaned horses			2
as @entity1 's neighbor and fellow horseman , he 's promised to do what he can to help -- even as he struggles in the face of the drought			1
his 60 - acre equine ranch is at capacity with thoroughbreds , quarter horses and appaloosas up for adoption			2
since the dry spell hit , calls for help have increased significantly			0
" usually , we get a phone call two to four times a month , " he said			0
" we 're getting them two to three times a week now			0
we 're at capacity , there 's a waiting list			2
" like @entity1 , @entity258 now purchases hay for the rescue horses and relies on donations to keep his organization running			2
" i 've been in this area all my life , and i 've never seen it this bad			0
it was just upon us so fast			0
hopefully we can get some rain , get some pasture back in and get some people back to work			0
it 's on the verge of very desperate , " he said			2
" the farmers do n't have anyone working			0
he says many people are considering sending their horses to slaughter			1
" it 's money for them , they ca n't get money otherwise			2
we like to let the horses live their lives out here			1
the founding of the ranch was to pay back the horse			0
the horse is what brought us here today			0
it took us across the @entity136 , it brought our food in , it plowed our fields , it got us to town and back			0
it 's a payback to the horse			2
" " in a month from now , i wo n't have many left			0
" across the road in @entity57 , @entity1 has six to eight horses leaving for new homes in the coming weeks			2
they 'll be separated and sent in trailers to different parts of the state			0
equestrian @entity332 will be one of the new owners : she 's taking a 3 - month - old colt off @entity1 's hands to raise in her own			2
but not everyone shares @entity332 's intention of raising a horse , @entity1 says			2
potential buyers have offered money per pound for each horse , a telltale sign of a plan to send the horse to slaughter			1
" i 'd rather borrow money and feed the horses than see them go to slaughter ... i 'm not going to let them starve , whatever it takes , " @entity1 said			1
he expects he 'll adopt - out every single one of his horses , but plays with the idea of keeping just one or two around for company			2
" i 've gotten close to them			0
they become a little bit like kids , " he says			0
" they become like a person , like a friend you 're saying good bye to			0

@entity365 loves his horses , but he 's going broke feeding them in the drought
he now must sell off horses and is wary of buyers who want to *re-sell* them for slaughter
one region alone in @entity9 could face $ 1 billion is drought losses
" now we have to live with a very serious drought of uncertain duration , " governor says
