-- the future of @entity2 may rest on whether @entity3 can recover its roots			1
with @entity8 president @entity7 " land grabbing " and violating international law , the alliance is finding itself " brought back to its core , " says @entity11 , @entity3 's former secretary general			1
but it is n't prepared			0
when @entity3 was founded in 1949 , its central task was to protect its members against military aggression and work to promote democracy -- which , in the years following , often meant standing against the @entity20 empire			1
the alliance declares success in achieving that goal peacefully , saying on its website that " throughout the entire period of the @entity27 , @entity3 forces were not involved in a single military engagement			1
" but things changed after the @entity27			0
the focus was no longer on @entity8			2
@entity3 says " new threats " emerged			2
the alliance got involved militarily in @entity33 in the 1990s , and later in @entity34			0
it established a military force in @entity37 , and has forces in @entity39 and some other parts of @entity41			0
now , @entity8 is increasing its reach , and getting close to @entity3 terrain			1
it annexed @entity46 's @entity45 in march and is accused of sending its troops into eastern @entity46 in support of @entity51 rebels , a claim that @entity53 denies			0
so , 55 years into its existence , @entity3 finds itself , as the @entity55 put it , going " back to the future			2
" just how to do that is a central question as the alliance convenes its summit in @entity61			0
" the problem @entity3 has is it 's not fully ready to be able to protect its own members , " @entity62 , director of the think tank @entity63 , told @entity0			1
@entity3 's military preparedness is " paltry compared to the kinds of steps the @entity8 are taking			1
" @entity3 wants each of its 28 member nations to spend 2 % of their gross domestic product on defense			2
while the @entity76 and @entity77 meet the target , 24 member nations do n't			0
there has been a " sort of cozy mentality that the @entity27 has gone and we can focus just on domestic investment , " @entity62 says			0
@entity83 , @entity84 : spend more on military @entity76 president @entity83 and @entity77 prime minister @entity84 said they " believe that @entity3 can adapt to meet the new challenges			1
" in a joint @entity89 in the @entity90 thursday , the two men wrote , " the changes we need are clear			0
with @entity8 trying to force a sovereign state to abandon its right to democracy at the barrel of a gun , we should support @entity46 's right to determine its own democratic future and continue our efforts to enhance @entity46 capabilities			1
" the military should " ensure a persistent presence in eastern @entity2 , " they said			0
the two leaders also called for a " multinational rapid response force , composed of land , air , maritime and special forces , that could deploy anywhere in the world at very short notice			0
" in addition , they urged all @entity3 nations to meet the 2 % target for defense spending			2
but some countries , including @entity120 , are resistant to do so -- " not only because of the weak @entity2 economy but also not to aggravate the crisis with @entity8 over @entity46 any further , " the @entity117 , which tracks security threats , said in a briefing thursday			1
still , @entity46 has sought @entity3 's help in the crisis			1
and while the country is not a member of the alliance , " its new leaders seek eventual membership " -- a move that angers @entity7 , the briefing noted			0
analyst : it 's the @entity134 's fault @entity135 , political science professor with the @entity136 , argues that it 's actually @entity3 's expansion that set @entity8 off			1
" the @entity76 and its @entity2 allies share most of the responsibility for the crisis			0
the taproot of the trouble is @entity3 enlargement , the central element of a larger strategy to move @entity46 out of @entity8 's orbit and integrate it into the @entity134 , " he wrote in foreign affairs			1
" at the same time , the @entity150 's expansion eastward and the @entity134 's backing of the pro-democracy movement in @entity46 ... were critical elements , too			0
" @entity83 and @entity84 disagree			1
" @entity8 has ripped up the rulebook with its illegal , self - declared annexation of @entity45 and its troops on @entity46 soil threatening a sovereign nation state , " they wrote in their @entity156 - @entity155 ' @entity163 moment ' as the summit convenes in @entity61 , " the @entity76 , @entity3 , and free nations around the world confront a pivotal moment of truth , " says sen. @entity164 , @entity165			1
" by now , it should be clear to all objective observers that @entity8 president @entity7 is not impressed by starkly worded statements and declarations , and if that is the only outcome in @entity61 , it could represent a historic failure of the alliance at a time when @entity3 's foundational purpose has renewed relevance , " @entity164 wrote in a column for @entity0			1
the changes @entity3 needs to make are possible , says @entity183 , a former @entity184 admiral who now serves as dean of @entity186 at @entity187			2
" the capacity is there			0
it 's a matter of re-gearing and doing ... rotational deployments into bases in the east			0
" " we 'll have to exercise much more frequently , " the former @entity3 secretary general , @entity11 , says of the alliance 's troops			2
" we 'll have to bring forces on the ground in @entity198 and in the @entity200 region to show @entity7 that @entity3 means serious business			2
" as @entity3 holds its summit in @entity61 , talk of an action plan is front and center			2
part of that means a focus on money			0
" more important than the amount spent is where it 's spent , " says @entity62			0
" not enough is being spent on new equipment , modernized capabilities -- new capability surveillance , precision munitions , aircraft defenses			0
" still , even if @entity3 undergoes a makeover to confront @entity8 , experts agree : wresting all of @entity46 back from @entity7 's grip is a very long shot			1
leaders hold pivotal @entity3 summit as threats of @entity224 , @entity8 aggression loom @entity3 : what should we expect ?			1

after @entity3 's founding , it stood against @entity8
now , the money and military are n't ready to do so
@entity83 , @entity84 and others say @entity3 can do it
analyst blames @entity3 , not @entity8 , for the crisis
