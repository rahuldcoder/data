@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 has found high levels of arsenic and heavy metals in two rivers in central @entity1 that are near the site of a spill that unleashed more than a billion gallons of coal waste			1
four days after the spill , the water is cloudy on the east bank of the @entity14 in @entity0 , @entity1			2
the agency said it found " several heavy metals " in the water in levels that are slightly above safe drinking - water standards but " below concentrations " known to be harmful to humans			1
" the one exception may be arsenic , " the agency said in a letter to an affected community			0
" one sample of river water out of many taken indicated concentrations that are very high and further investigations are in progress			2
" however , arsenic was not detected in a water intake facility near @entity0 , @entity1 , where the spill happened , said @entity3 spokeswoman @entity33			1
the metals were found in the @entity36 and @entity14 rivers , near the site of a major spill last week that unleashed enough sludge to fill 1,660 @entity41 - size swimming pools			1
the @entity3 's letter comes as the head of the largest public power company in the nation pledged to clean up the massive spill			0
" this is not a time where @entity49 holds its head high , " said @entity47 , president and ceo of the @entity49			2
" but we wo n't hang our head , either , because that wo n't get the job done			0
i 'm here to tell you that we will clean it up , and we will clean it up right			0
" the sludge is a byproduct of the ash from coal combustion			2
a retention site at the @entity49 's power plant in @entity0 , about 40 miles west of @entity67 , contained the waste until a wall breached last monday , sending the sludge downhill to damage 15 homes and cover at least 300 acres			1
all residents in the area were evacuated , and three homes were deemed uninhabitable , according to the @entity49			1
the @entity49 's initial estimate for the spill tripled from 1.8 million cubic yards , or more than 360 million gallons of sludge , to 5.4 million cubic yards , or more than 1 billion gallons			1
the plant sits on the @entity14 , which is a tributary of the @entity79			0
video footage from the river , a popular fishing site , reveals piles of dead fish on its banks			2
the @entity49 says that has nothing to do with the toxicity of the sludge , though environmental advocates say the ash contains concentrated levels of mercury and arsenic			1
@entity49 officials have said water quality tests from a nearby water treatment facility have shown that the water from the river intake meets federal and state guidelines for potable water			1
but coal operation critics remain concerned about the long - term effects of the spill , and residents have expressed concerns about drinking water , especially from wells			1
@entity110 emergency management director @entity109 said the county has asked the state and the federal @entity3 to monitor groundwater from wells around the area			0
@entity116 and @entity47 spoke at a town hall meeting sunday			0
@entity118 said the county has also requested air quality tests from the state and federal agencies			0
@entity123 , an independent aquatic biologist , told @entity2 that a spill of this magnitude probably will affect the area 's ecological balance			0
" once the ash has settled to the bottom of the rivers , all heavy metals will hang around for a long time , " he said			1
" when coal releases into the water , the mussel population goes into deep freeze			2
they are the ' canary in the coal mine			0
' they are the main indicator of how healthy our water is			0
" @entity2 's @entity143 contributed to this report .			0
