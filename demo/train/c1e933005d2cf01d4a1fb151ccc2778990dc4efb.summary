@entity0 -- a faulty pipe , flawed operations , and inadequate government oversight led to the 2010 @entity7 natural gas explosion that killed eight people , federal officials said tuesday			1
during a public board meeting , @entity10 investigators delivered their final report on the matter , sharply criticizing pipeline owner @entity14 for the explosion in @entity17 , saying the pipe was inadequate from the time it was installed in 1956			1
that was compounded " by a litany of failures " over several years , including poor record - keeping , inadequate inspection programs , and " an integrity management program without integrity , " @entity10 chairwoman @entity20 said			2
" it was not a question of if this pipeline would burst , " she said			2
" it was a question of when			0
" @entity20 said the probe yielded " troubling revelations about a company that exploited weaknesses in a lax system of oversight , and government agencies that placed a blind trust in operators to the detriment of public safety			1
" the september 9 , 2010 , explosion created a 72 - foot long , 26 - foot - wide crater , destroyed 38 homes and left eight dead in @entity17 , near @entity46			1
a 28 - foot segment of the pipe was found about 100 feet away from the crater			0
scorched homes and the shells of burned - out cars lined charred streets where firefighters battled hot spots trying to save the devastated neighborhood			0
@entity14 did not respond to @entity1 's requests for comment about the report , but in advance of the hearing , the company released a statement saying it had taken " multiple steps " to improve the safety of its natural gas operations , including efforts to replace aging pipe and improve contacts with local police and fire departments			1
in a statement posted on its website , the company said , " the @entity10 's continued work to determine the cause of this tragic accident is critical in helping @entity14 and the industry understand what steps need to be taken to avoid a future accident like the one in @entity17			1
as before , we will update our improvement plans based on these latest findings without delay			0
" @entity10 investigators determined the explosion was caused by a substandard and poorly welded pipe , creating a weak spot that grew to a critical size , causing the pipeline to rupture during a pressure increase stemming from poorly planned electrical work			1
they said the faulty welds should have been detected when the pipe was originally laid in the ground in 1956			0
compounding the problem , investigators said , was the fact that @entity14 failed to alert emergency responders as soon as they realized the line had burst			2
isolating the rupture to stop the flow of gas took over an hour , and put first responders in a defensive mode as they struggled to put out the fire , investigators said			0
" there was a lot of denial in the operating room that maybe it 's a plane , maybe it 's a gas station , " said @entity107 , the @entity10 's investigator - in - charge			2
at a mid-day news conference tuesday , @entity20 said the problem " could have been detected if they ( @entity14 ) had hydrostatically tested the line , if they had done in - line inspections			2
" " there were a lot of opportunities missed here by @entity14 , " @entity20 said			2
during the board meeting , board member @entity123 noted that the @entity125 failed to exercise adequate oversight and enforcement of @entity14 , and that the federal regulator , the @entity128 , which is a part of the @entity130 , failed to monitor the state commission 's oversight of @entity14			1
" this accident is not just about the failure of a seam in a pipeline			0
rather it 's about a failure of an entire system -- a system of checks and balances that should have been put in place to prevent the disaster , " @entity123 said			0
board members pointed to past @entity14 - related incidents as examples of the company 's lax procedures , noting a gas explosion resulting in a fatality in 2008 , and a gas main break in 1981 that forced more than 30,000 people to evacuate @entity46 's financial district			1
the @entity10 closed the hearing with 26 recommendations , including requiring natural gas pipeline operators to equip their systems with real - time recognition tools to pinpoint leaks and line breaks , and automatic shut - off and remote control valves in " high - consequence areas			1
" speaking to members of the press after the hearing , @entity20 said the recommendations " are strongly worded and far - reaching			0
" she said the board 's recommendations in the past have not been taken seriously			0
" we 've heard a lot of promises , but now what we 're asking is ... that regulators are tough , " she said			0
" the regulators are the only ones that are standing between the operators and the public , and the public is counting on them to make sure the operators are doing the right thing			0
" @entity46 city attorney @entity188 , who has filed an intent to sue the @entity125 and federal regulators " for their failure to reasonably enforce safety standards , " said in a statement issued after the @entity10 's meeting that the investigators ' findings support his move			1
@entity14 runs three major gas pipelines , including the one involved in the @entity17 explosion , under " nine high - population - density neighborhoods in @entity46 , " @entity188 said			1
@entity1 's @entity202 contributed to this report .			0

an @entity10 report is critical of pipeline owner @entity14 and government regulators
@entity14 " exploited weaknesses in a lax system of oversight , " the @entity10 chief says
the @entity17 explosion killed eight people and destroyed 38 homes
@entity14 says it has taken " multiple steps " to improve safety since the blast
