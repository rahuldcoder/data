-- when most people think of @entity2 , if they think of it at all , they imagine poverty and war			1
they imagine a world and people that are far removed from the everyday life that most of us reading this are lucky enough to enjoy			2
but that was not my experience in the world 's youngest nation			1
what i saw on my three trips through @entity2 were people just like you and me			1
people with desires and needs			2
people with resilience , determination			2
but above all -- hope			2
a year ago monday , conflict again erupted in @entity2			1
since then , thousands of people have been killed , nearly 2 million people have been forced to flee their homes , and 6 million @entity2 -- almost half the country -- have found themselves in desperate need of aid			1
last week , as i traveled through @entity41 , a small village in @entity2 's @entity43 , with the aid organization @entity44 , i met people whose lives have been turned upside down by conflict over the last year , but who still have n't lost their belief that things can get better			1
at a camp for people who had crossed the @entity53 to escape the violence that destroyed their homes , a middle - aged @entity57 man , who was easily 7 feet tall , told me that armed men had stolen all of his cows -- his main source of income			0
when i offered my sympathy for his loss , he smiled and said , " do n't worry , i will get more cows			0
" indeed , much of the story of @entity2 is a story of hope			1
when the country gained independence in 2011 after more than half a century of war , people danced and cried with joy in the streets as they looked forward to a future of peace and development			1
@entity0 photos : a nation on the brink of an abyss through the valiant efforts of the @entity2 people and support from the international community and organizations like @entity44 , things were getting better			1
new roads were paved , communities without access to clean water saw wells drilled , and violence was drastically reduced			0
tens of thousands of young girls were receiving education for the first time			0
things were changing for the better			0
but then last december , a power struggle between the country 's president and vice president turned violent and led to a skirmish between some of their supporters that has wreaked havoc across the country			0
church leaders and civil society groups have appealed for peace and reconciliation			0
people i met are opposed to -- and terrified by -- what 's happening			2
but as the summer 's rains have ended and the roads are once again passable , the fighting has resumed and is likely to get worse in the coming weeks			0
although the conflict has taken on an ethnic tone , people i spoke with were at pains to tell me that this was n't a conflict between the @entity57 and @entity128 tribes , who have lived together , worked together , and intermarried for generations			0
standing in the midst of rows of newly planted tomatoes , one @entity57 man took a break from weeding to tell me that he believed in a peaceful future for @entity2 -- but not without greater action from the international community			2
" when you have problems within your family , " he told me , " you sometimes ca n't solve it yourself ; you need someone from outside to come in and help you reconcile			0
" his words were echoed by so many @entity2 i spoke with , who highlighted the special role of the @entity147 in helping the country achieve peace and gain its independence , and asked for @entity147 's assistance again now			1
as we mark one year since the start of this terrible conflict , we have to do more to support @entity2 peacemakers and pressure the country 's leaders to stop fighting			1
the resilience of the people of @entity2 can only go so far without a political solution to this conflict			1
even now when i think of @entity2 , i do n't think of war			1
i do n't think of poverty and children with @entity165			0
all of this exists within the country , but i think of the confident cattle herder who believes he will regain his lost cows , even in the face of such despair			0
i think of the many pregnant young women i met , who were excited for their future and the future of their children , hoping that it would include peace and a chance for a good education			0
but most of all i think about the many incredible people i met who have lost everything they have in the world , but still manage to keep going and keep hoping for peace			2
it is for those people that the @entity147 must act to keep that hope alive			1
join us on @entity190 / @entity189 .			0
