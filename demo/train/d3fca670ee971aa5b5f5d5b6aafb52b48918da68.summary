@entity1 , @entity0 -- it is still remembered as one of the worst days in the history of modern sailing			0
the @entity8 race still remains one of the biggest events in the yachting calendar			1

it was 30 years ago today that a freak storm struck over 300 vessels competing in the 600 - mile yacht race between @entity0 and @entity23			1
mountainous seas and vicious high winds sunk or put out of action 25 boats			0
the @entity29 rescue attempt turned into an international effort with a @entity32 warship and trawlers from @entity34 also joining the search			0
in spite of the biggest rescue operation launched by the @entity29 authorities since the @entity40 a total of 15 people died			1
some of them drowned and others succumbed to hypothermia			0
six of those lost went missing after their safety harnesses broke			1

" most people in the sailing community at the time knew someone who was involved in one way or another			1
i had a friend who lost his father			0
" in total 69 yachts did not finish the race			2
the former @entity29 prime minister , @entity14 disappeared at the height of the storm , though he later returned to shore safe from harm			1
the corrected - time winner of the race was the yacht " @entity74 " , owned and skippered by @entity75 , the founder of @entity2			1
@entity47 said that in the aftermath of the disaster the rules governing racing were tightened to ensure boats carried more ballast			1
improvements were also made to the safety harnesses that tied crewmen to their boats , many of which proved ineffective in the tragedy			1
it also became mandatory for all yachts to be fitted with radio communication equipment and all competitors were expected to hold sailing qualifications to take part			2
at the time of the tragedy the @entity8 race was the last in a series of five races which made up the @entity100 competition , the world championship of yacht racing			1

the press team was based at the @entity126 hotel in @entity121 and early tuesday morning @entity110 got a call from his superiors to go to the hotel immediately in order to field calls from journalists			0
" the night before we 'd noticed high winds but there 'd been no forecast of bad weather so we did n't think much of it , " @entity110 told @entity2			0
" as the morning progressed though , we heard that more and more boats were missing			2
it became obvious a tragedy was unfolding			2
" @entity110 said the worst part for him was fielding calls from concerned relatives			0
" the @entity115 headquarters was overloaded so calls were getting transferred to the press team			0
