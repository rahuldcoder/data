we 've learned that some varieties of fish are low in fat and contain oils that keep the heart healthy			0
but recent reports about contaminants such as mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls , or @entity10 , have prompted some health experts to rethink their advice about seafood			1
lots of varieties of fish are safe , but some types of seafood can be risky for certain groups of people			0
for @entity22 cardiologist @entity21 , @entity23 , it is n't just her patients she worries about			0
it 's her family , too			0
" ours has a history of high cholesterol , " @entity26 says			2
" so i eat fish frequently to keep my cholesterol down			0
" lately , she finds herself scanning medical journals and government advisories to stay abreast of fish safety issues			0
she says that untangling the facts behind the latest seafood scares is n't as complicated as it seems			0
" the key is to place the benefits and risks into perspective , " @entity26 says			2
" lots of varieties of fish are safe			0
it 's just that some types of seafood can be risky for certain groups of people			0
" here 's a look at which fish pose risks , and which ones are safe -- and good for you , too			0
the truth about salmon a 2004 study in the journal @entity60 raised concern among fish lovers with news that farm - raised salmon , the type found at most supermarkets , contained higher levels of cancer - causing pcbs than wild salmon			1
( banned in the 1970s , @entity10 still contaminate the environment			1
they are released by incinerators and toxic waste sites			0
) but two more recent studies , one on farm - raised salmon and the other on wild , found that both harbor similar levels of this pollutant			1
the first study , done with @entity83 - and @entity84 - farmed salmon , found an average of 11.5 parts per billion pcbs			1
the second , conducted by the @entity89 of @entity90 , sampled 600 wild salmon from the @entity92 and the @entity93 , and found 8.2 to 10 parts per billion pcbs			2
it 's important to realize that the amount of pcbs being talked about is very small , says @entity99 seafood specialist @entity98 , who has studied fish safety issues for 22 years			0
" high doses of @entity10 , like the kind of contamination that occurs with an industrial accident , can be dangerous , " @entity98 says			1
" but it 's uncertain whether the tiny amounts of @entity10 found in many foods such as fish , meat , or milk can cause cancer			1
" most health experts feel the health benefits of salmon far outweigh the risk posed by minute levels of pcbs			1
@entity118 , @entity23 , a professor of medicine at @entity120 , in @entity121 , who has spent most of his career studying the health benefits of the @entity125 fats found in salmon , says he has no qualms about recommending farm - raised salmon			1
" i would rather my patients not miss out on the benefits of salmon , a fish with some of the highest levels of heart - healthy omega - 3 fats around , than fear pcbs , " he says			1
@entity118 adds that for most people , farmed fish might be all that 's available in the local supermarket			0
indeed , the majority of the 16 pounds of fish the average @entity143 eats annually is farmed			0
another benefit of farm - raised salmon and other fish , he says , is that they 're typically low in mercury			1
@entity152 : 7 salmon main dish recipes minding mercury since exposure to high levels of mercury can cause neurological damage in a growing fetus , the @entity156 continues to issue related seafood safety advisories to pregnant women and young children			1
in march of 2004 , the @entity156 updated that advice with stricter , more specific rules : pregnant women , or women who plan to become pregnant , should avoid eating four fish with high levels of mercury : swordfish , shark , tilefish , and king mackerel			1
while fresh and canned tuna did n't make the @entity156 's list , many experts say pregnant women may be better off limiting fresh tuna steaks and canned albacore , or " white , " tuna to one meal per week or less , since these large fish can harbor mercury levels close to the one part per million threshold the @entity156 deems safe			1
( canned light tuna is considered safe since it is made with smaller skipjack fish that are low in mercury			1
) the @entity191 recently encouraged the @entity156 to require supermarkets to post warning signs about mercury near canned tuna as well as at the fish counter			2
@entity197 : risks , benefits of 8 most popular @entity143 seafood being aware of mercury is also a good idea for those who are n't pregnant			1
when internal medicine specialist @entity205 , @entity23 , performed a yearlong study of 123 of her patients , she found that a steady diet of high - mercury fish caused serious symptoms such as headaches , hair loss , problems with concentration , and high blood levels of mercury			1
fortunately , once these patients switched to eating low - mercury varieties , symptoms began to disappear , and blood mercury levels returned to a safe level			1
minimize risk @entity224 seafood expert @entity223 , @entity225 , thinks the key to minimizing health risks for any food is to aim for variety			2
" if you ate swordfish or shark or king mackerel every day , you could experience mercury toxicity , " @entity223 says			1
" but if you eat them once a month [ and trade off with ] some other low - mercury fish , it should n't be a problem			1
" however , the " sensitive population , " including pregnant and nursing women , should always avoid swordfish , shark , tilefish , and king mackerel , @entity223 says			1
on his list of safe , low - mercury options : shrimp , salmon , pollock , farm - raised catfish , tilapia , flatfish ( flounder , sole , plaice ) , scallops , haddock , farm - raised trout , herring , crawfish , mullet , oysters , ocean perch , sardines , squid , white fish , and anchovies			1
he eats seafood three or four times per week and calls the health benefits of fish , particularly the varieties that harbor omega - 3 fats , profound			1
" these fats prevent heart disease			0
they lower blood pressure and help prevent strokes			0
and studies show that eating two meals of fatty fish like salmon or sardines each week can help prevent sudden death , " @entity118 says			2
@entity197 : the alphas of omega - 3s there are additional benefits as well			2
" [ by eating fish ] you may be replacing a fatty meal like a bacon cheeseburger with something low in fat , " @entity26 says			0
she advises her patients to eat fish at least twice per week , particularly those rich in omega - 3s			2
and after looking at all the safety issues , she feels comfortable taking her own advice			0
safe supplements if fish can harbor toxins , it seems plausible that the oils extracted from fish to make supplements might be contaminated , but that 's not the case			0
" fish oils are pure , " says @entity118			0
one recent study tested 16 fish oil supplements sold in warehouse clubs , pharmacies , and supermarkets , and none contained significant amounts of mercury , pcbs , or the pollutant dioxin			2
currently , the @entity321 recommends 1,000 milligrams of fish oil supplements per week for people with heart disease			0
according to @entity118 , supplements are a great way for nonfish lovers to tap into the important heart - healthy benefits of omega - 3 fatty acids			2
angling for trouble freshwater sport fishing brings its own share of safety concerns because of runoff from farms and sewage treatment plants , as well as the same environmental contaminants like mercury and pcbs that are found in ocean fish			1
" the risk is different if you 're fishing in a lake and eating only fish from that lake , " says @entity99 's @entity98			2
" chances are you 'll be eating a good amount of the fish you catch , so your exposure levels to a particular contaminant , or the contaminants in the lake , will be higher than exposure levels for someone who eats a variety of commercial fish from many sources			2
" @entity197 : selecting , storing and cooking fish @entity98 advises anglers to check with their local or state environmental health department for the most current warnings regarding the area where they plan to fish			2
if waters are safe to fish , the @entity366 suggests catching the smallest fish allowed -- as a rule , the smaller the fish , the fewer the contaminants			0
other safe freshwater choices include bluegill , perch , stream trout , and smelt			0
since these panfish feed mainly on insects , they 're less likely to harbor pollutants			0
pregnant women are advised to eat only six ounces of freshwater fish a week since freshwater predator fish such as walleye , smallmouth and largemouth bass , lake trout , and @entity388 pike tend to contain higher levels of mercury than other local water varieties			1

chief concerns are contaminants such as mercury , cancer - causing @entity10
health benefits of salmon seen to outweigh the risk posed by minute @entity10 levels
pregnant women should avoid high - mercury swordfish , shark , tilefish , king mackerel
some experts say pregnant women also should limit tuna consumption
