@entity0 , @entity1 -- olympiads often come with their fair share of controversy , and the @entity1 city of @entity0 -- the host for the 22nd @entity8 -- drew more than its fair share			1
but aside from the security concerns that may now seem over anxious , accommodation complaints made in main by attending media , warm weather that failed to melt the venue 's snow , and domestic laws that arguably ran contrary to the @entity19 spirit , the sporting occasion that unfolded was worthy of much celebration			1
from a spectator point of view the new venues -- whether at the temperate coast or in the crisp mountain zone -- provided fantastic stages for the world 's finest winter sports athletes to compete for the glory of becoming champion			2
just under 3,000 competitors from 88 nations vied over 17 days in 98 events , providing moments of drama and destiny that captured the imagination and settled in the collective memory			1
below are my 10 highlights from the games			2
have your say in the comments box at the bottom : 1			2
@entity46 's hockey haul : in a poll carried out on the @entity2 live blog , 42 % of you voted for this as your favorite sporting moment of @entity52 , and there will be no argument against such wisdom here			1
facing a two - goal deficit against their neighborly rivals the @entity59 , and with just four minutes left of the third period , @entity46 refused to accept defeat			2
@entity62 got her team back into the game before @entity65 sensationally equalized			0
an enthralling overtime then saw @entity65 strike again in a power play to seal a 3 - 2 victory			0
it was an epic comeback to win gold , but it did n't end there			1
just three days later the men 's side -- after inflicting their own defeat on the @entity59 in the semifinals -- crushed an out - classed @entity78 3 - 0 to defend the title they won in @entity80			1
@entity46 's men have now topped the podium in three of the past four @entity8 ( 2002 , 2010 , 2014 ) , which by anyone 's standards is a great achievement			0
@entity87 dominance : the @entity88 is a world - class facility worthy of hosting the best long - track speed skaters from across the planet , but the thoughtful designers suffered from a key oversight : if the winners ' podium had been located more closely to the @entity87 team area it would have saved a lot of bother			1
so dominant were the orange - clad gliders that even if every other nation had formed one team , the @entity87 would still have nearly doubled their medal tally			0
what started with an opening - day clean sweep in the men 's 5,000 meters was bookended by victory in the men 's team pursuit , as the team set an @entity19 record in the last race of the @entity19			0
the @entity87 haul included eight golds , seven silvers and eight bronzes , accounting for 23 of the 30 individual medals up for grabs			1
an the victor : @entity1 hoped they 'd picked up an ace card when @entity122 short - track skater @entity121 , a three - time gold medal winner from the @entity124 , gained his citizenship in 2011			1
discarded by the nation of his birth for being too old and injury prone , he promptly changed his name to @entity121 and plotted revenge			0
in a remarkable run in @entity0 , @entity131 drew cheers from his adopted nation and boos from @entity136 by winning the men 's 500m , 1,000m and the 5,000m relay too			1
he also picked up a bronze in the 1,500m event			1
in doing so , an took his career gold tally to six , became @entity1 's first short - track champion at 1,000m and also is the first person to win gold in all four short - track events in @entity8 history			1
we can only wonder what the @entity122 team thought of that			0
superpower showdown : ok , so we have two hockey submissions to the list but this game was surely worth it			0
the former @entity158 rivals , 34 years after the " @entity156 , " met again in the @entity159 and tested the resolve of the new roof by creating an exhilarating atmosphere with this @entity19 classic			0
the home crowd was vociferous , partisan and passionate ; especially when their side took the lead in the second			0
but the @entity59 fought back off the ropes to equalize on the counter and then took the lead shortly after			0
all seemed lost to many anxious fans until @entity173 draw @entity1 level			0
this is when the real drama started			1
@entity177 thought he 'd won it for his side before his goal was ruled out to @entity59 's relief			0
the game then went to overtime followed by a nail - biting , finger - chewing and hand - swallowing sudden - death shootout in which @entity186 scored four goals from six attempts to secure the @entity59 victory			0
in truth , neither side played as well again			0
@entity192 : @entity194 's @entity193 told reporters in @entity0 that , at the age of 33 , the time may be right for her to turn her attention away from the 2018 @entity8 and towards having a family instead			1
bad news for @entity194 but a godsend for any ambitious cross-country skier out there , because @entity193 's grip on the top prizes of the discipline has been so tight there 's been little room for anyone else			0
a triple - gold medal winner in @entity80 , @entity193 took the top prize in the 30 km mass start , the 15 km skiathlon and the team sprint classic here in @entity0 to cement her place as the most decorated female in @entity8 history			1
arguably , the sweetest of her 10 career medals came in what could be her last event at the @entity19 , when she topped the podium in the first @entity194 clean sweep of the grueling 30 km race since 1992			2
biathlon 's best : @entity194 had good " legendary " representation in its men 's team too , in the form of 40 - year - old @entity231			0
it 's 21 years since @entity231 made his @entity234 debut , but in @entity0 he showed that age is no barrier to elite competition by winning the biathlon men 's sprint and mixed relay too			1
the new trinkets pushed his career tally to eight golds from a record 13 medals overall and made him the oldest gold medalist in @entity19 history			1
the man -- who became the first biathlete to win four gold medals at a single games in 2002 -- told reporters : " these victories have been a four - year job and it has been many years since i won ( an individual gold medal ) , but life is too short to give up			1
" the @entity19 spirit personified			0
dance destiny : in a tale of ice skating rivalry that stretches over two olympiads , the partnership of @entity265 and @entity266 gave @entity59 something to smile about despite those humbling hockey moments			1
they delivered the @entity59 ' first ice - dance gold as well as beating @entity46 @entity272 and @entity273 -- the @entity80 champions -- into second place			1
it was a sweet moment for the two , who train with their opponents in @entity279 , and saw a reverse of the result that gave them silver four years ago			2
but it was their near - flawless performance of the short program , which earned them a world - record score of 78.89 , that captured the imagination			1
their masterclass in synchronized fluidity delivered them an overall score of 195.52 to finish 4.53 ahead of @entity272 and @entity273			2
@entity296 said it was the result of " 17 years ' hard work " -- plus a little help from their @entity1 coach @entity300 , who also works with @entity272 and @entity273			2
@entity302 rises in @entity0 : @entity19 are often marked by the rising of new talent , and the 2014 edition that took place at the @entity307 resort were no different			1
@entity308 -- a 15 - year - old @entity1 figure skater -- had the crowds in @entity0 giving standing ovations such was the brilliance of her audacious performances on ice			1
in the women 's team competition she dazzled with her poetic , gyroscopic movement and became @entity1 's youngest champion ever			0
a fall in the individual competition allowed the gold to go to her compatriot @entity321 , but her place in the hearts of so many had already been cemented			2
who knows what she can achieve in the years to come			0
a shared gold @entity328 's pop - star skier @entity327 had a @entity19 to remember			2
she skied fantastically through slushy snow and difficult conditions to top the podium in the giant slalom , an event she led from start to finish and won from @entity335 of @entity336 by just 0.07 seconds			0
but it 's her performance in the downhill that will probably live longer in the memory after she made @entity19 history , along with @entity341 , when the pair registered identical times despite taking different paths down the slope			0
it was the first time a gold medal had been shared in the event 's 78 - year history			2
in winning , @entity327 also became the first woman since @entity351 of @entity352 in 1972 to be champion in both downhill disciplines			0
marriage delivers medals : in a tale that will please romantics around the world , @entity59 - born @entity357 and his @entity1 wife @entity358 showed that love can help deliver medals as well as happiness			2
after struggling with financial support at home , snowboarder @entity367 became a @entity1 citizen in 2011 after his wedding and was determined to give a return to the show of faith from his adopted country			0
in a nice twist of fate he took gold in the parallel giant slalom minutes after his wife had captured bronze in the women 's event			1
the win , followed by his success in the parallel slalom , meant he became the first snowboarder to win two golds in one games .			0

controversy aside , @entity0 delivered a sporting occasion worthy of celebration
88 nations vied over 17 days for medals of bronze , silver and gold
98 events delivered moments of drama and destiny that captured imagination
