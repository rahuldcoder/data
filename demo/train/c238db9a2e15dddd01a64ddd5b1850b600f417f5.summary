investigators suspect another physician , dr. @entity24 , gave the drug to @entity7 in the 24 hours before he died , according to a source , who asked not to be named because the individual was not authorized to speak to the news media			2
@entity16 , who practices in @entity30 , @entity1 , told @entity7 during a visit to his @entity33 home that the drug was " dangerous and potentially life - threatening and could not be used outside of a hospital , " attorney @entity29 said			1
@entity16 's medical records for @entity7 , whom he treated until 2003 , have been given to the coroner , @entity29 said			1
he said @entity16 prescribed drugs for @entity7 under the alias @entity14 and @entity7 , which was not illegal since he used both names together			0
the doctor did that because he thought it was " his duty to protect the privacy " of his patient , @entity29 said			0
@entity14 is one of 19 aliases listed in the warrant used by @entity0 police and federal drug agents tuesday to search the @entity52 , @entity51 , office and home of @entity24 , a @entity54 - based cardiologist			0
the warrant also mentioned @entity55 , a nurse practitioner who treated @entity7 earlier this year			0

she said she refused , telling the pop star that if he took the medicine , he might never wake up			0

@entity105 goes to court monday @entity105 's legal battle for some control of her son 's estate returns to court monday in front of the same judge who is expected to award her permanent guardianship of his children			1
@entity7 's lawyers filed a petition tuesday accusing the men who now control the estate of being " intent on keeping her in the dark " about deals they 've made or are negotiating			1
@entity7 lawyer @entity125 raised questions about " a suspicious circle of relationships " involving @entity129 , the singer 's longtime personal attorney , and @entity132 , a music industry executive and longtime friend -- who were named executors in @entity7 's will			1
@entity137 judge @entity136 gave @entity129 and @entity132 temporary control of the estate until monday 's hearing			1
in the @entity7 lawyers ' petition , they asked the judge to order @entity129 , @entity132 and others to answer questions under oath about their business agreements to determine if they are " fit and able " to administer the estate			2
they also served the men with a 19 - page demand for documents			0
@entity129 has refused to let @entity105 see @entity7 's contracts with @entity156 , the company that was organizing and promoting his planned concerts , unless she agrees to keep them confidential			2
@entity129 's lawyer argued in a court filing that he has no choice since the contracts have a provision requiring confidentiality			0
@entity129 's lawyers also argued that @entity7 's demand for documents was too broad and burdensome			2
" such measures will not be necessary if mrs. @entity105 is appointed a co-executor of the estate , " @entity125 said			0
@entity125 , in an interview with @entity172 on thursday , estimated the @entity7 estate was worth $ 2 billion , while the executors have estimated in court that its value is around $ 500 million			2
the will written in 2002 places all of @entity7 's assets into a family trust benefiting his mother , his three children and unnamed charities			1
the judge is also expected monday to finalize @entity105 's guardianship of her son 's three children			2
an agreement between @entity7 and @entity188 , the mother of the two eldest children , cleared the way for an uncontested custody hearing			1
@entity188 , who was briefly married to @entity7 , agreed not to fight for custody in exchange for visits with the children as recommended by a psychologist			2
the agreement does not involve any financial payments to @entity188 " apart from the continuation of spousal support payments " that @entity7 personally agreed to make to @entity188 after their divorce , their lawyers said in a joint statement			0
@entity7 's children have been living with their paternal grandmother at her @entity207 , @entity1 , home since their father 's death			1
the eldest child , @entity211 , was born in february 1997			0
a daughter , @entity214 @entity213 , was born the next year			0
details of how the children were conceived -- and who was the biological father -- have been closely guarded amid much public speculation			0
the couple divorced in 1999 with @entity188 giving @entity7 full custody while she got an $ 8.5 million settlement , according to court documents			0
@entity7 later agreed to additional support			0
@entity188 gave up parental rights to @entity7 in 2001 , but she changed her mind more than two years later and sought temporary custody of the children			1
a @entity1 appeals court later ruled her rights were improperly terminated , opening the door to a possible custody battle			0
