-- at the beginning of the school year , a couple of hundred parents , myself included , gathered in the middle school lounge for the principal 's back - to - school speech			0
the chatting hushed as the principal walked from the back of the room to the podium			0
as she proceeded down the aisle , parting the crowd of parents , she carried with her the biggest bottle of hand sanitizer i 've ever seen			2
expert : washing hands works well to prevent many diseases , but it 's not very helpful agains the flu virus			1
when she arrived at the front of the room , the principal , all 5 feet and 100 pounds of her , used every bit of her strength to hoist the giant jug onto the lectern			0
" welcome back to school , " she said			0
" swine flu stops here			0
" the principal explained that between each and every class , the teachers would supervise the children while they sanitized their hands			0
in addition , students would be washing and sanitizing their hands at other times , such as before lunch and snack			2
my eldest daughter confirmed that they really were cleaning their hands at least every 45 minutes , but exactly eight days later , the e-mails started to arrive : a case of suspected @entity50 flu in the seventh grade , another in kindergarten , and then another and another			1
at one point at my daughters ' school , they were sending home a dozen students a day sick with symptoms of @entity50 flu			2
a sneeze in the theater versus a germy handshake what happened here ? how come with all that hand washing so many children still became ill ? according to some experts , you can wash your hands all you want , and it wo n't do much to stop the spread of influenza , including the @entity50 variety			1
" washing hands really is wonderful for preventing many diseases , such as the common cold , but it 's not very helpful to prevent influenza , " said @entity76 , professor of epidemiology at the @entity78			1
i gave @entity76 two scenarios			0
the first : i 'm sitting in a movie theater next to -- but not touching -- someone with @entity50 , and he sneezes and does n't cover his mouth			2
the second : someone with @entity50 rubs his nose , shakes my hand , and then i rub my nose			1
in which situation am i more likely to catch the flu ? that 's easy , said @entity76 , an infectious disease specialist who advises on vaccine policy for the @entity99			0
the theater incident is much more likely -- much , much more likely , he said -- to give me the flu , since inhaling particles results in a bigger dose of the virus			1
a spokesman for the @entity106 agrees there is n't strong evidence that hand washing fights @entity50			1
" we do n't have solid data on the effect that hand washing has on the transmission of @entity50 , " @entity106 spokesman @entity110 wrote in an e-mail			1
but he said there 's still reason to be vigilant about hand washing			1
" there are studies that show hand washing was effective in reducing transmission of other respiratory diseases , " he said			1
dr. @entity122 , a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at @entity125 in @entity126 , said hand washing is n't all that helpful against the flu because the flu is n't like other respiratory diseases			1
" the flu virus is n't very stable on the hand , " he said			1
" the virus has a lipid membrane that flattens out when it 's on your hand , and it gets inactivated			2
" the rhinovirus , on the other hand , which causes the common cold , can live quite nicely on someone 's hand			2
" it has a different architecture than a flu virus , " he said			0
" it 's much more stable			0
" the flu virus thrives in droplets of water , such as the kind that come out of your mouth when you sneeze or cough			1
" the lipid membrane stays intact when it 's surrounded by a droplet of water that 's ten times bigger than the virus itself , " @entity122 says			1
infectious disease experts and the @entity106 agree the flu is more likely to be transmitted through airborne particles than through hand contact			1
however , they disagreed on the extent to which flu is caused by hand contact compared with inhalation of particles			2
@entity169 , an adjunct professor at the @entity170 , thinks a significant number of flu cases do indeed spread from hands touching one another			0
" i think that hand contact accounts for maybe one - third of influenza infections , " he said			0
hand washing : a false sense of security from @entity50 ? some infectious disease experts said they 're concerned messages from the @entity106 to wash hands to prevent @entity50 have given people too much faith in hand washing			1
" everyone 's eager to promote hand washing , and certainly it wo n't do any harm , but to rely on a hand washing as a way to prevent influenza is a serious mistake , " said @entity76			1
" do n't kid yourself that you 're going to protect yourself from the flu completely by washing your hands , " said @entity190 , a professor of epidemiology at the @entity192			2
the @entity106 has emphasized other prevention techniques , such as vaccination , as well , @entity110 said			0
" @entity106 has communicated from the get - go that hand washing is only one tool in the toolbox used to prevent the transmission of influenza , " he said			1
this brings me back to my experience at my daughters ' school			0
the e-mails from the principal said some of the sick children reported to the school nurse that they 'd woken up ill , but their parents sent them to school anyway			0
what 's up with that ? if your child is sick , keep her at home			0
if you 're sick , do n't go to work			0
using that particular tool in the toolbox will go a long way toward stemming the spread of h1n1 flu -- probably more than washing your hands			2
@entity0 's @entity228 and @entity229 contributed to this report .			0

hand washing can reduce risk of catching a cold ; not as helpful against @entity50
@entity50 virus not stable on hand ; instead it thrives in droplets of water
inhaling airborne particles , from cough or sneeze , results in a bigger dose of virus
regardless , washing hands " really is wonderful " for preventing many diseases
