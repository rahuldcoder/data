@entity0 , @entity1 -- we traveled by metro to the @entity0 suburb of @entity6 , where the phrase over my dead body takes on a new meaning ; it 's the first town in @entity1 that has placed solar panels in its municipal cemetery and has been attracting global attention and causing local discussion			1
@entity6 cemetery : where many rest in peace , some see renewable energy			2
we could quickly see why the town officials said there was not enough land to put the solar panels on the ground			1
the town is densely packed with tall apartment buildings for its population of 124,000 people , many of whom commute to work in nearby central @entity0			1
from @entity6 's city hall plaza , we took a taxi to the cemetery situated on the town outskirts , and the driver provided the first indication that not everyone approves of solar panels in a final resting place			1
" in @entity1 culture there 's a lot of respect for the dead			2
i do n't think people will like this idea , " said taxi driver @entity47 , whose grandmother and uncle are buried in the cemetery			0
he said he did n't even know about the cemetery solar panels , even though town officials had told us earlier that there had been a broad public information campaign to inform residents and solicit their opinions before the solar panels were even installed			1
the cemetery provided further evidence of the land crunch in town			2
few people are actually buried in the ground here			0
instead , like in the apartment buildings , the deceased are stacked up in tall mausoleums , rising to five levels			0
many @entity1 towns have similar cemeteries and where were the solar panels ? it 's true that the solar panels are not easily visible from the ground in many parts of the cemetery , but from up the hill and looking down the photovoltaic panels become readily apparent			1
perched atop the mausoleums is a veritable sea of solar panels , connected by cables that channel the electricity into a small transformer station at the top of cemetery hill , which connects to tall electrical towers nearby			1
we stopped at the tomb of @entity93 , who died in 1985 and rests in the top row of a mausoleum			2
there are four other tombs directly below her , but directly above her is a large solar panel			0
@entity101 's family firm is in the cemetery management business			0
it has the contract to manage the @entity6 cemetery -- among others in @entity1 -- and the idea for the solar panels came from the firm			1
@entity101 , a cheerful man who speaks @entity1 , @entity110 and @entity111 said the aim was to put the solar panels discreetly in the cemetery			1
" we think it 's important for the cemetery to generate this clean energy , but it 's so important to respect the use , the normal use , of the cemetery , " @entity101 said			0
the cemetery florist , @entity123 , whose father and grandfather are buried here , perhaps had a bit of graveyard humor as she told us , with a smile			0
" nothing 's going to happen to the dead once they 're here if there are solar panels up above			2
" we also talked to @entity134 , a housewife who has two brothers buried in the cemetery			0
she approves of the solar panels , and said that 's partly because another brother installs solar panels in @entity141			2
@entity6 's environment councilor , @entity142 , told us about the city 's other solar initiatives , on the roofs of schools -- one of which we visited -- and at the library			0
the town proudly says the @entity151 has recognized it in the fight against global warming			0
but the cemetery has many advantages over the other locations in town for solar panels , @entity142 said			1
" you have a large surface , with no chance of shadows on it that would reduce the energy production , " @entity142 said			0
the cemetery currently provides enough electricity to power 60 homes , @entity101 said			1
there are more solar panels planned for the cemetery , and @entity101 said a dozen other cities in @entity1 and @entity173 have expressed interest in following their lead and are considering installing solar panels in their own cemeteries			1
where many rest in peace , some see a renewable opportunity .			0

solar cemetery in town just outside @entity0 the first of its kind in @entity1
panels fixed on top of five - storey mausoleum , power 60 homes
*relatives* of deceased generally have no *objections* to solar installation
