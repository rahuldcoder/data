-- @entity2 and @entity3 words that describe @entity4 , where @entity5 arrived saturday as part of a three - nation tour of @entity8			1
she left @entity10 where diplomatic drama over a @entity10 human rights activist overshadowed all else and stepped foot in @entity4 amid political turmoil involving the disappearance of a key opposition leader			1
her presence , the first by a secretary of state since 2003 , reflects @entity21 's interest in growing ties with @entity8 nations and puts @entity4 , one of the world 's most impoverished nations strategically located near @entity27 , @entity10 and @entity28 , on center stage			1
@entity31 's trip , said a senior @entity33 official , is an opportunity to improve @entity21 's bilateral relationship with @entity4 , a democratic @entity2 - majority nation that is seen by @entity36 as a viable alternative to extremism			1
it 's a bilateral relationship that was initially troubled because of @entity21 support for @entity41 in @entity4 's war of independence , won in 1971			2
but ties between the two nations have improved considerably and the @entity21 is now @entity4 's largest trading partner			0
@entity46 will meet with prime minister @entity47 and foreign minister @entity48 , and is expected to stress the importance of democratic institutions and ways to improve conditions for the 160 million @entity4 who live in a country the size of @entity55			1
@entity36 sees @entity4 , the world 's largest contributor of personnel to @entity61 peacekeeping forces , as a willing partner on counterterrorism and global security , the @entity33 official said			1
@entity46 will discuss development issues with micro-credit guru and @entity68 laureate @entity67 and @entity69 , the founder of @entity70 , a large non-profit that works to alleviate poverty			0
@entity46 will also meet with @entity72 , leader of the opposition @entity73 ( @entity73 ) amid considerable political tension			1
@entity77 's party and the ruling @entity78 have accused each other in the abduction of key @entity73 lawmaker @entity81			0
the disappearance has sparked rallies and strikes that have led to deaths of at least four people , according to @entity87			0
@entity81 's disappearance is the latest in a spate of disappearances in which security forces have been implicated , although they deny detaining those missing , @entity87 said			0
more than 20 people have " disappeared " in @entity4 this year , the global monitoring group said			0
@entity46 is visiting @entity4 12 years after her husband , @entity46 , did so as the first @entity21 president to make such a trip			2
@entity5 goes next to neighboring @entity27 , where she is scheduled to stop in @entity99 , near the @entity4 border , and @entity101			2
there , she will meet with the feisty chief minister , @entity103 , who dismantled 34 years of communism in last year 's @entity106 state elections but is very much opposed to allowing large foreign retailers like @entity108 in @entity27			0
ironically , @entity46 's visit to @entity101 coincides with that of an @entity112 trade delegation that is looking for ways to circumvent tough @entity21 sanctions that have proven crippling to the economy of the @entity117 republic .			0

@entity36 sees @entity4 as a viable alternative to extremism
the @entity2 - majority nation is moderate and democratic
but it has seen political turmoil after the disappearance of an opposition leader
@entity46 next goes to @entity27
