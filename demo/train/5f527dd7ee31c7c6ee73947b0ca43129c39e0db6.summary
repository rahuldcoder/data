clearly something is broken when a @entity2 man named @entity3 can be sentenced to die in prison for purchasing seven pounds of marijuana			1
with two nonviolent marijuana convictions already on his record , @entity3 received life without parole under @entity2 's three strikes law			1
the punishment of growing old and dying behind bars for offenses like @entity3 's is extreme , tragic , and inhumane			2
this should outrage us , but it should not surprise us			0
this country has spent 40 years relentlessly ratcheting up the number of people going to prison and dramatically expanding the time we hold them there			1
we 've spent decades criminalizing people with drug dependency , passing extreme sentencing laws , and waging a war on drugs that has not diminished drug use			1
small wonder , then , that even less serious crimes like @entity3 's marijuana purchase result in costly and cruel sentences			2
and @entity3 is hardly the only one			0
just as he fell into the abyss of our nation 's failed drug policies and excessive sentencing laws , millions more have sat in jails and prisons , often for years , even decades on end , for low - level drug and property offenses			1
while many of the lawmakers who passed harsh sentencing laws thought they were doing the right thing , the results are now in : this approach has devastated families and communities , generated high recidivism rates , drained state budgets from more productive investments , and has reinforced generations of poverty and disadvantage that disproportionately fall on communities of color			1
there were ways to hold @entity3 and others like him accountable for their actions short of sentencing them to die in prison			0
we can and must do better			0
it 's time for states to end the costly criminalization of marijuana and recalibrate sentencing laws so that the punishment actually fits the crime as opposed to a politician 's reelection agenda			1
public attitudes toward marijuana are rapidly evolving , and a @entity79 poll last year found for the first time that a majority of @entity82 now favor legalization as a better course than criminalization			0
unfortunately , laws and police practices that enforce them are out of step with public opinion			0
nationally , nearly half of all drug arrests are for marijuana offenses			1
at least one person is arrested for marijuana possession every hour in @entity3 's home state of @entity2 , which also wasted nearly $ 50 million on marijuana enforcement in 2010			1
although black people and white people use marijuana at about the same rate , a black person in @entity2 was 2.6 times more likely to be arrested for having marijuana than a white person			1
instead of taxpayers spending millions of dollars on this unnecessary enforcement and keeping folks like @entity3 in prison for the rest of their lives , states could follow @entity113 and @entity114 by taxing and regulating marijuana and investing saved enforcement dollars in education , substance abuse treatment , and prevention and other health care			2
but even if states are not ready to expand their tax base in this manner , state lawmakers need to take a good , hard look at their sentencing laws and eliminate penalties that far outweigh the crimes they seek to punish			1
it is tempting to think that @entity3 's case is an anomaly , but that is not the case			0
according to a report released by the @entity135 last year , there are currently 3,278 people serving life sentences without parole for nonviolent crimes , including marijuana offenses			2
many of them , like @entity3 , are there because of three - strikes laws and mandatory sentencing regimes			2
these policies force judges to impose excessively cruel sentences and forbid corrections officials from granting early release or parole , even despite exemplary records in prison			0
the good news is that there is a growing bipartisan consensus all over the country that our criminal justice system has gone too far and that we can and must safely downsize our prison population			0
@entity2 recently reformed the three strikes law that sentenced @entity3 to prison for life			1
if he were sentenced today , he could have received a significantly shorter sentence and be eligible for parole			2
as states like @entity2 make these kinds of reforms , we must not forget the people who languish behind bars because of old sentencing laws now thought to be excessive			1
smart reforms that correct past injustice should be made retroactive , and governors must use their clemency powers more frequently			0
@entity2 gov. @entity176 should grant clemency to @entity3			2
public safety is not served by having him die in prison			0
we 're not stuck with the criminal justice system that sentenced @entity3 -- a system that too often is unproductive , wasteful , and unfair			0
bad policies are made , and bad policies can and should be changed			0
join us on @entity185 / @entity184 .			0
