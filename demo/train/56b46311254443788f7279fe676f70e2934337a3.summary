@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 received praise monday from @entity1 's president for the decision last week to stop deporting some young illegal immigrants			1
after the two leaders met one - on - one before the start of the @entity12 summit in @entity0 , president @entity8 thanked @entity3 for what he called an " unprecedented " move in halting the deportations			1
" we believe this is very just , " @entity8 said , according to an interpreter , adding : " thank you for the valor and courage that you had in implementing this action			1
i 'm sure many , many families in the @entity24 thank you as well			2
" @entity3 made no new comment on the election - year policy change announced friday that prompted immediate praise from @entity29 leaders who have criticized @entity30 and the @entity31 for inaction on immigration reform			1
@entity34 have reacted with outrage , saying the move amounts to amnesty -- a negative buzz word among conservatives -- and usurps congressional authority			1
in announcing the change in the @entity42 , @entity3 said it will make immigration policy " more fair , more efficient and more just			2
" " this is not amnesty			0
this is not a path to citizenship			0
it 's not a permanent fix , " @entity3 said to take on conservative criticism of the step			2

" under the new policy , people younger than 30 who came to the @entity24 before the age of 16 , pose no criminal or security threat , and were successful students or served in the military can get a two - year deferral from deportation , homeland security secretary @entity69 said			1
it also will allow those meeting the requirements to apply for work permits , @entity79 said , adding that participants must be in the @entity24 now and be able to prove they have been living in the country continuously for at least five years			0
the change is part of a department effort to target resources at illegal immigrants who pose a greater threat , such as criminals and those trying to enter the country now , @entity79 said , adding it was " well within the framework of existing laws			1
" the move addresses a major concern of the @entity29 community and mimics some of the provisions of a @entity103 proposal called the @entity104 that has failed to win enough @entity34 support to gain congressional approval			2
@entity3 has been criticized by @entity29 - @entity24 leaders for an overall increase in deportations of illegal aliens in recent years			1
