the peace talks with president @entity14 ended early saturday , the @entity12 told @entity1			1
@entity14 's press secretary , @entity15 , said a joint document based on a prior peace plan agreed to in @entity18 , @entity19 , in september , is not yet complete			2
the parties will engage in further talks by phone on sunday , @entity15 said			1
the new diplomatic push comes as a worsening conflict in eastern @entity11 is taking an increasingly heavy toll on civilians			2
speaking in @entity27 before her departure for @entity0 , @entity2 said she hoped to secure a ceasefire , but the prospects were not certain			2
she said she was " sure that there is no military solution to the conflict " and that she and @entity4 would " work against this escalation with all our powers to stop this horror " as they meet with @entity14			0
@entity2 made clear that she would not do a deal with @entity7 that bypasses @entity11 's leadership , saying she " will not decide anything over the heads of anyone			1
" the solution must be in line with the @entity18 agreement , she said			0
@entity7 , @entity11 and separatist leaders signed that pact , but continued fighting left it in shreds			1
it 's not yet clear how the new proposal differs from the @entity18 agreement			0
@entity4 said thursday that the joint proposal for new negotiations would be " based upon the territorial integrity of @entity11			1
" the pair hope the proposal will be acceptable to all parties in the conflict , he said			0
but he said that " the option of negotiation , of diplomacy , can not be extended indefinitely			0
" @entity66 leaders and @entity67 accuse @entity7 of fostering the conflict by providing weapons and training to the @entity71 separatists battling @entity11 forces in the @entity74 and @entity75 regions , as well as sending regular @entity7 troops over the border to fight			1
amid the diplomatic maneuverings , there were reports from @entity11 suggesting that more civilians could be evacuated from current conflict zones			2
both sides in the conflict have been blamed for shelling civilian areas			0
the self - proclaimed @entity87 said on its website that it had offered @entity67 the chance for civilians to leave @entity91 , northeast of the city of @entity74 , where shells have been falling for days			0
@entity91 is under government control , and police efforts to evacuate civilians have been underway for days , hindered by the shelling of the main road out of the city			0

@entity123 secretary of state @entity122 , speaking on a visit to @entity67 on thursday , insisted that the ball was in @entity0 's court to resolve the crisis in its neighboring country			1
he called on @entity0 to take three steps he said would enable a diplomatic solution " that is staring everyone in the face			2
" those include pulling back heavy weapons beyond the range of civilian populations , removing foreign troops and heavy equipment from @entity11 , and closing the @entity7 - @entity11 border			1
@entity122 said no one wanted conflict with @entity7 , but " we can not close our eyes " to tanks , heavy weapons and soldiers crossing the border from @entity7 into @entity11			1
@entity7 leaders must be blind if they keep denying that forces from their country have crossed the border , @entity11 prime minister @entity146 added			1
" if they need , i can give them my glasses , " @entity146 said			0
" it is crystal clear that ( the ) @entity7 military is on the ground			2
we are not fighting so - called rebels or guerrillas			0
we are fighting with the @entity7 regular army			2
" @entity15 , the @entity14 spokesman , told @entity1 that @entity122 's remarks in @entity11 " just shows the unwillingness and inability of the @entity123 to participate in settlement of the @entity11 crisis			1
" he said , " as for @entity7 tanks , allegedly crossing @entity7 - @entity11 border , we 've commented on this before -- there are no @entity7 tanks or army in @entity11 , such accusations are not true			1
" the annual @entity173 was to start friday in @entity3 , when the crisis in @entity11 is likely again to top the agenda			1
