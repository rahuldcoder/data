-- as both president @entity2 and @entity3 make the case for creating jobs , they are ignoring one of the fastest - growing job creators in our economy : the nonprofit sector			1
the only mention of nonprofits on the campaign trail or in the debates has been whether to limit tax deductions for charitable donations			2
for the sake of our economy , the health and continuous growth of this sector should be a priority for the next president			1
the size and scope of the nonprofit sector may come as a surprise			1
there are almost 1.5 million nonprofit organizations in the country , including well - known brands like the @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and the @entity35 , as well as many smaller and more community - based service organizations , schools , congregations , sports leagues and hospitals			1
taken all together , the sector generates almost $ 1.5 trillion in spending per year and employs about one in 10 @entity45 workers , or 13.5 million people			1
it is the third largest labor force behind retail trade and manufacturing			1
if your son or daughter is considering a career in nonprofits , do n't be alarmed			2
while nonprofits are known for employing social workers , they also need managers , human resource professionals , educators , artists , computer programmers , marketers , accountants , athletes , carpenters , researchers , cooks and many other skilled workers			0
and as one of the fastest - growing job sectors over the past decade , nonprofits offer plenty of good jobs			1
according to a study by @entity81 of @entity82 , " the @entity45 nonprofit sector posted a remarkable 10 year record of job growth despite two recessions , achieving an annual growth rate of 2.1 % from 2000 to 2010			1
" in comparison , for - profit jobs declined by 0.6 % per year during the same period			0
the study continues , " even during the recession from 2007 to 2009 , nonprofit jobs increased by an average of 1.9 % per year			1
at the same time , businesses averaged jobs losses of 3.7 % per year			0
" there are several reasons that account for the growth			0
in a time of economic challenges , nonprofits have grown to meet the greater needs in our communities			0
many services previously provided by the government are now contracted to nonprofits			0
changing demographics , especially the aging of @entity45 , has increased demand for services			0
the sector has also experienced a wave of entrepreneurship and innovations , along with adoptions of best practices from businesses , that have increased its effectiveness and size			2
one might question whether jobs created in the nonprofit sector are really private - sector jobs , since many of the jobs are subsidized by the government through tax - deductible donations and direct grant support			1
but the truth is that many private - sector businesses receive tax credits , tax deductions , government grants and government contracts			2
no one dismisses as private - sector jobs those at @entity133 , which received $ 16 billion in government contracts from 2009 to 2011			2
@entity135 , which paid no federal taxes last year			0
when there are proposals to cut defense or other federal programs that fund businesses , @entity137 often protects them because those cuts kill private - sector jobs			2
should n't @entity137 likewise protect cuts in federal funds that eliminate middle - class jobs that provide health , education , opportunity , safety and culture for our communities ? here are some things the next president can do to support a growing nonprofit sector : 1			1
maintain the charitable tax deduction and the estate tax			0
restricting the flow of private resources into the nonprofit sector will affect its opportunity to create and sustain jobs and impact			1
charitable giving overall is essential to our communities , democracy and economy			2
but there is still a need to explore how to drive more giving toward greater problems like poverty rather than university endowments			0
provide student loan forgiveness and incentives for veterans			0
most nonprofits are not able to invest in training and development , so young employees bear those costs			0
allowing student loan forgiveness for those who devote their lives to service and allowing a new @entity188 to invest in returning veterans who want to serve their communities at home would make a great difference			0
with 87,000 people serving in @entity196 nationally , this public - private partnership has become a critical human capital source for the nonprofit sector			1
both presidential candidates have been champions of service , and whoever wins should implement the bipartisan @entity203 to grow @entity196 to 250,000 people			0
expand the federal social innovation fund and new sources of financing , such as social impact bonds , so that investments can go into helping organizations and programs that show evidence of success			0
open federal investments in small businesses and jobs to nonprofits			0
nonprofits are not able to access the same incentives as businesses to grow and train their work forces			2
if nonprofits could receive tax credits , they could sell in a secondary market to businesses to grow more jobs			0
in addition , the @entity229 and other federal programs that support jobs could open opportunities to nonprofits			2
investing in the nonprofit work force is a double win because it would create good jobs and improve our quality of life through mission - driven goals			1
the nonprofit sector should be a central part of any discussions about our economic recovery strategy			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity249 .			1
