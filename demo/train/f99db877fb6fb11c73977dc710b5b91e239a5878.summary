two purported @entity2 fighters interviewed for a news agency working in @entity2 - held territory have given the same reason for the militants ' retreat from the @entity9 city of @entity10 : the constant pummeling by coalition airstrikes			1
on monday , @entity14 fighters declared that they had released the city on the border to @entity17 from @entity2 ' grip after 112 days of fighting			2
the efforts of the @entity14 fighters -- known as the @entity22 , or @entity22 -- on the ground were backed by an extensive campaign of airstrikes by the @entity27 - led international coalition against @entity2			1
and according to the interviews given to @entity2 - aligned @entity31 news agency in @entity9 , it was those airstrikes that won the battle for @entity10 , referred to by the fighters as @entity35			1
" recently , we have withdrawn from @entity35 bit by bit , because of the airstrikes and deaths of a number of our brothers , " said one of the two fighters , his face covered apart from his eyes			0
he points to a scene of destruction behind him but vows that @entity2 will persist , " and this is the message we send to @entity50			0
" the second fighter interviewed by @entity52 stood near a road sign reading @entity35			0
he said @entity2 forces had raided 360 villages around @entity10 , from which the people " ran away like rats			1
" but the reason behind their withdrawal from the city , he said , " is that we no longer had places to hold there			0
we were inside @entity35 and we occupied more than 70 % , but the airstrikes did not leave any building standing , they destroyed everything			0
" his horror of the airstrikes was apparent			0
" i swear by @entity73 , their planes did not leave the air , day and night ; they did airstrikes all day and night			1
they even attacked motorcycles ; they have not left a building standing			0
but by @entity73 willing we will return and we will have our revenge multiplied			0
" @entity2 is on its heels after the loss of @entity10 and an offensive by @entity86 -- armed fighters who protect @entity89 's @entity14 region -- around @entity90 , @entity89 's second - largest city and a focal point for all sides in the conflict			1
but on friday , the @entity95 extremist group launched an assault on @entity89 's oil - rich city of @entity99 in what may be an attempt to divert @entity14 troops from @entity90			2
a report by @entity104 , a private website dedicated to presenting news from a @entity14 perspective , said at least 30 @entity2 fighters were killed in the assault and 15 captured			1
casualties on the other side included @entity112			0
gen. @entity113 , the highest - ranking operational commander of the @entity86 brigade located in @entity99			0
@entity2 captured 15 employees working at the @entity117 oilfield southwest of @entity99 after launching their assault in the area , @entity112			1
gen. @entity120 , the head of @entity99 's suburbs and villages police , told @entity0 on saturday			2
a joint operation is underway by his police officers , @entity86 and @entity14 security forces to free the hostages and take back control of the oilfield , seized by @entity2 militants on friday , @entity120 said			2
troops have already liberated @entity132 , also taken by @entity2 on friday and located next to @entity134 oil field , he said			2
meanwhile , gen. @entity135 , the head of @entity86 forces in @entity138 , in @entity140 province , was killed in clashes with @entity2 in southwestern @entity99 , @entity142 , a senior @entity14 figure and local @entity86 leader , told @entity0 on saturday			1
@entity135 brought his troops from @entity138 , about 100 miles away , to reinforce the @entity86 in @entity99 following the @entity2 assault , he said			1
@entity27 and coalition aircraft carried out 17 airstrikes in @entity89 on friday , according to a @entity150 statement , 10 of them near @entity99 and two near @entity90			1
both the coalition and the @entity86 are trying to prevent @entity2 from opening a new front in @entity99 , which @entity2 likely hoped would lessen the pressure on @entity90			1
additionally , by going on the offensive here , @entity2 appears to be offering some obvious targets for strikes			0
if @entity2 can be driven back from positions in @entity99 , it will have to try other tactical offensives to draw @entity14 forces away from the outskirts of @entity90			1
the @entity14 on their own admission have no intention of entering @entity90 but want to choke off @entity2 supply lines into the city			0
another 10 airstrikes were carried out friday against @entity2 targets in @entity9 , eight of them near @entity10			1
according to the @entity172 , a @entity173 - based opposition group , from october 6 to monday the fighting for @entity10 killed 979 @entity2 combatants , 324 ypg fighters and 12 rebels backing the @entity22			1
thirty - eight more @entity2 militants died in attacks using booby - trapped vehicles or bomb belts , and the @entity2 shelling of @entity10 killed 12 civilians , @entity172 said			2
" on the other hand , hundreds of ( @entity2 ) militants died during @entity27 and @entity189 allies ' airstrikes on the city and its countryside , " the group said			2
however , the success of the coalition airstrikes in @entity10 will be hard to replicate elsewhere			1
there are almost no civilians left in the city of @entity10 , and most residents left early on when the fighting started , especially in the contested areas close to the front line			0
this meant airstrikes were fairly straightforward , with the coalition able to target one side and avoid civilian casualties			0
the front line was well defined , so it was clear where the @entity2 and @entity14 fighters were			2
a more challenging situation is when airstrikes seek to target @entity2 inside populated areas like @entity90 in @entity89 , @entity212 in @entity9 and other cities under @entity2 control			0
here the effectiveness of airstrikes is limited because of the risk of casualties among civilians			0
when coalition airstrikes hit cities in @entity223 , in northern @entity9 , civilian deaths were reported last year			2
@entity0 's @entity224 and @entity225 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 *kidnapped* 15 oil workers southwest of @entity99 , local police chief says
two purported @entity2 fighters say constant coalition airstrikes in @entity10 drove them out
" their planes did not leave the air , day and night , " says one fighter
