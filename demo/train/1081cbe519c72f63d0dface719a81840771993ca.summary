@entity0 -- after turning a traditional @entity4 drink into a hit @entity6 product , @entity2 is now trying re-brand @entity7 itself			1
@entity4 entrepreneur @entity2 is the creator of multi-million dollar @entity6 company @entity9 , which makes drinks based on traditional recipes from around the world			1
she came up with the idea in 2004 , after she returned home to @entity4 and found soda drinks were replacing the country 's traditional hibiscus drink , known as bissap			1
she arrived back in the @entity6 determined to share healthy traditional recipes with the rest of the world			1
@entity9 's products now include organic coffees and exotic fruit drinks and are sold all over the @entity6			1
" my biggest pride was to know that it was possible , that the vision i had was possible and my vision was that the world is hungry for well - executed @entity7 brands , " @entity26 said			1
" we saw it at the investor level and we saw it at the buyer 's level and we saw it at the consumer 's level			0
everyone wanted to be part of that adventure and it was just amazing			0
" scramble for ' dot africa ' internet domain name now @entity2 is now building a new company , @entity48 , in @entity0			1
it 's a high - end skin care line based on traditional @entity4 recipes , using natural ingredients indigenous to @entity7			1
" what we are doing now is a concept phase where we make sure a product is right , the packaging is right , the branding is right , the marketing is right , " she said			0
" we are in the process of making sure that people will buy into it			0
in our first three weeks of existence we landed a pretty cool account already , so we 're getting there			0
" her goal is to inspire others , so that in the next 10 years there is an @entity7 company among the top 100 global brands			2
@entity26 says that when it comes to marketing an @entity7 product it 's not just about selling units , it 's about selling a different image of @entity7 to consumers			2
she argues that most people see @entity7 in terms @entity80 © s , such as safaris , tribal designs or people needing charity			2
her goal is to change the perception that both @entity7 and @entity86 have of her home continent			2
" i think a lot of @entity7 , unfortunately , the overwhelming majority , does still not yet feel comfortable about themselves			2
there is this complex of inferiority that is pervasive in the culture			0
" a lot of it has to do with history ... yes we have @entity99 in office today but it does n't change a lot			0
and i 'm not even talking about racism , that 's not what i 'm talking about			0
what i am talking about is just groups of people not feeling good enough about themselves ; if you do n't have the right type of self esteem you go nowhere in this world			0
" but self - esteem will also come if enough of us today that are in the age of working , if enough of us can really get together and try and build a different brand for @entity7 , a brand that all of a sudden means ' contributors to the world , ' rather than a subset of a population that 's always sucking energy out of others			1
" @entity7 can teach the world to innovate while her products are currently made in the @entity6 , the plan is to move production to @entity4 once @entity130 has generated enough profit			1
@entity26 says the company plans to donate 10 % of profits to a foundation supporting the next generation of @entity4 leaders			2
" if i have to share with people my deepest dream , that 's the level at which i want to play -- not just do well for myself and even for my employees but i really want to make sure that the next generation is well prepared , " she said			0
" or at least we have a cluster of people that are going to go and really accomplish things that we can all be proud of			0
