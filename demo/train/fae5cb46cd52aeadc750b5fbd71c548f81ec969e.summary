@entity0 , @entity1 -- what if we offered illegal immigrants a path to citizenship that included a stint in the @entity9 military ? @entity10 : be wary of offering military service as a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants			1
the idea has been trumpeted by thoughtful people such as @entity16 , a fellow at the @entity17 , who thinks this is the time for a " freedom legion			1
" he 's talking about a unit of the military made up entirely of the foreign - born -- including illegal immigrants -- where the compensation would include @entity9 citizenship			1
about 70,000 foreign - born men and women serve in the @entity9 armed forces , or about 5 percent of the total active - duty force , according to the @entity30			1
of those , nearly 30,000 -- or about 43 percent -- are not @entity9 citizens			0
roping illegal immigrants into military service could accomplish two goals at once : helping alleviate the military 's recruitment worries while giving the undocumented a chance to prove that their commitment to this country extends beyond a paycheck			1
we 're already talking about requiring illegal immigrants to learn @entity44 , pay fines , and return to their home countries to earn legal status			1
why not , some say , raise the stakes and require men and women between 18 and 42 to serve a couple of years in the military to earn something even more precious : @entity9 citizenship for themselves and their children ? the idea appealed to a reader in @entity60 who called me to gauge my reaction			2
i told him that i had n't made up my mind , but that the concept did fit with my view that any conferring of legal status be laden with onerous conditions so that it really is earned			0
to earn it , illegal immigrants should have to do everything but walk across broken glass			2
still , i told him , i 'm not sure how those who oppose comprehensive reform but support turning illegal immigrants into cannon fodder go about squaring that circle			2
restrictionists and racists have argued that illegal immigrants are invading this country , and that they 're a dangerous menace to society that is prone to all sorts of violent and criminal behavior			1
of course , many native - born @entity9 citizens are just as menacing			2
but for those who believe that illegal immigrants are inherently violent , do they really want to give these folks military training and a @entity91 , to help them graduate from menacing to lethal ? after all , assuming they survive their stint in the military , they eventually have to return stateside			1
then they 're our problem			0
consider the ghastly events in @entity100 , @entity101 , where three @entity103 students were killed execution - style and a fourth was shot in the head but survived			2
the accused ringleader is @entity107 , an illegal immigrant from @entity108 , who was previously charged with raping a 5 - year - old girl and threatening her parents			1
twice indicted by grand juries , @entity107 slipped through the cracks and was released on bail			0
authorities say that the 28 - year - old construction worker led at least four other individuals in attacking the youths with a gun and a machete			0
if convicted , @entity107 could get the death penalty			0
if half the things they say about this creep are true , @entity107 belongs on death row			0
but guess what ? he sure does n't belong on an @entity128 recruitment poster , or handling heavy artillery			0
@entity130 is a member of the editorial board of the @entity132 and a nationally syndicated columnist with the @entity134			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer			0

is it time for a military " freedom legion , " made up of all foreign - born *troops* ?
is military service as a way to citizenship for illegal immigrants a good idea ?
@entity107 , accused in the @entity100 killings , makes the *proposal* problematic
illegal immigrants are considered dangerous menaces by some
