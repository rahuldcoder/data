a week ago , president @entity0 landed in @entity1 with a considerable political limp after this month 's midterm elections			1
but as the president left @entity5 following a @entity6 in @entity7 , the narrative , at least overseas , spotlighted @entity0 with more of a spring in his step			1
" this was a strong week for @entity15 leadership , " @entity0 said at a news conference at the conclusion of the summit on sunday			2
the headline in the country 's " @entity19 " tabloid read " @entity22 , " below a picture of a confident - looking @entity15 president			2
@entity0 's trip to @entity24 began with a foreign policy bright spot -- the release of two @entity15 prisoners from @entity28			1
in @entity1 , the president unveiled a surprise climate deal with @entity1			2
stopping in @entity31 , @entity0 pointed to progress in democratic reforms in the @entity34 country			1
arriving in @entity5 , there were ample opportunities to take some jabs at @entity39 president @entity38			1
as a result , @entity0 left for @entity41 , largely having avoided the mishaps that dogged his recent foreign travels -- save of course the blip of chewing gum in @entity1			1
the result was a trip more focused on deliverables than distractions			2
" if you ask me i 'd say that 's a pretty good week , " @entity0 said sunday			2
" i intend to build on that momentum when i return home tomorrow			0
" challenges however were n't far behind @entity55			0
within hours after @entity0 's departure from @entity5 , a new foreign policy test had emerged for his administration -- reports that an @entity15 aid worker , @entity59 , had been beheaded by @entity60			1
related : @entity0 calls hostage 's beheading by @entity60 ' pure evil ' before leaving @entity5 , the president offered no apologies for @entity38 's frosty reception in @entity7			1
but he steered clear of the heated rhetoric used by @entity5 prime minister @entity68 who scoffed that @entity38 was reliving the glories of the @entity71 or @entity73 prime minister @entity72 who ordered the @entity39 leader to " get out of @entity76			1
" @entity0 simply described his own interactions with the @entity39 leader as " businesslike and blunt			1
" he indicated he is not considering any moves to ramp up @entity15 sanctions on @entity80			0
" the sanctions that we have in place are biting plenty good , " @entity0 insisted			2
the @entity85 murder is likely to renew questions about the president 's approach for dealing with the terror group			0
at his news conference , the president was asked about statements made at a congressional hearing last week by the @entity94 , @entity95 who held out the possibility he may recommend @entity15 ground forces engage in combat in @entity99			0
" there are always circumstances in which the @entity15 might need to deploy @entity15 ground troops , " @entity0 told reporters			0
the president , who often chastises reporters for engaging in hypotheticals , offered one of his own			0
" if we discovered that @entity109 had gotten possession of a nuclear weapon and we had to run an operation to get it out of their hands , then yes you can anticipate that not only would chairman @entity95 recommend me sending @entity15 ground troops to get that weapon out of their hands , but i would order it , " he added			0
for months , the president has repeatedly ruled out deploying combat troops into the battle against @entity60			0
" i will not commit you , and the rest of our @entity128 , to fighting another ground war in @entity99 , " @entity0 assured soldiers at @entity125 in @entity126 last september			0
much of the president 's attention during his trip to @entity24 was devoted to his renewed ambition to confront the issue of climate change			1
earlier in the week in @entity31 , the president brushed off the notion he should work with @entity139 leaders in @entity140 for a bipartisan approach to climate			1
" i have responsibilities as president not just to current generations but to future generations , " @entity0 said			2
as temperatures in @entity7 soared into the triple digits during the @entity6 summit , @entity0 took note of @entity5 's vast natural resources as he gently poked the country 's prime minister @entity68 , who is a key ally on issues ranging from @entity60 to @entity76 but is also a climate change critic			1
" the incredible natural glory of the @entity156 is threatened , " @entity0 warned			0
" no nation is immune , and every nation has a responsibility to do its part , " @entity0 said			0
after an unexpectedly eventful week overseas , @entity0 will likely plunge back into a series of showdowns with congressional @entity139 , beginning with the fight over the president 's upcoming executive action on immigration			1
related : defiant @entity0 says he wo n't bend to @entity139 still , the more assertive @entity169 attitude , driven by a president undeterred by his midterm defeat is drawing cheers from @entity174 supporters			2
" since the midterms , @entity175 has taken the lead on net neutrality , climate change and now immigration			0
give em hell , " liberal talk show host @entity181 tweeted about the president 's new unapologetic tone			0
but @entity0 joked about his diminished political standing back home , when he was asked at a youth town hall what he would do as president of @entity31			1
" you 're always popular in somebody else 's country			0
when you 're in your own country , everybody is complaining , " the president said .			0
