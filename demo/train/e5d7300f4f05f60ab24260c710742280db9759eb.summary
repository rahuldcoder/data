president @entity1 's administration is trying to open channels of communication with @entity4 regarding the war on @entity6			1
amid revelations that @entity1 sent a letter to @entity4 supreme leader ayatollah @entity9 last month pointing out the countries ' shared interest in beating @entity6 , a senior @entity13 official and a @entity15 diplomat tell @entity16 that @entity17 has gone through the @entity18 to communicate with @entity4			1
the conversations do not include taking joint military action against @entity6 targets , the sources said , but are seen as necessary to avert conflict in @entity13 and @entity4 operations			1
senior @entity26 adviser @entity25 would n't address specific outreach efforts in an interview with @entity16 's @entity30 , but said : " we work very closely with the @entity18 and the @entity18 have a relationship with the @entity4			2
" the discussions through the @entity18 are informal and conducted on a case - by - case basis via the @entity18 military , the sources said			0
the channels have become necessary , the @entity13 military official said , because the @entity13 and @entity4 are now operating in the same spaces			2
as a result , " accommodations must be made indirectly , " this official said			0
this includes airspace management , so @entity13 and @entity4 forces do not conflict while carrying out military operations in the same airspace , @entity16 was told			2
the revelation of the communications channel comes even as the military and administration continue to insist it is not cooperating with the @entity4 on strategy or intelligence			0
" with respect to @entity4 , we 're not coordinating with @entity4 , as you know , " said gen. @entity54 , the head of @entity55 , at an event moderated by @entity16 's @entity57 on thursday , when asked how the @entity13 prevents any accidental killing of @entity4 who are on the ground advising @entity18 forces			1
the @entity26 also stressed it is not working alongside the @entity4 military			0
" the @entity13 will not cooperate militarily with @entity4 in that effort			2
we wo n't share intelligence with them , " @entity26 spokesman @entity67 said thursday when asked about another communication between president @entity1 and @entity4 's @entity9			1
@entity67 would not acknowledge @entity1 's letter , saying he would not talk about the " private correspondence " of the president			0
" i can tell you that the policy that the president and his administration have articulated about @entity4 remains unchanged			0
the @entity13 is engaged in conversations with @entity4 in the context of the @entity82 - plus - 1 talks to resolve the international community 's concerns about @entity4 's nuclear program , " @entity67 said			1
" we have also discussed on the sidelines of those talks on at least a couple of occasions , the ongoing campaign that is being conducted against @entity6 by the @entity13 and 60 members of -- now more than 60 -- members who are part of this broader coalition			1
" @entity95 sens. @entity94 and @entity96 blasted the @entity1 administration , saying it 's " outrageous " to reach out to the " same @entity4 regime that has been complicit in the rise of @entity6 by pushing a violent sectarian agenda throughout the @entity101			1
" " the administration needs to understand that this @entity4 regime cares more about trying to weaken @entity13 and push us out of the @entity101 than cooperating with us , " @entity94 and @entity96 said in a joint statement			1
" until we recognize that reality , and formulate a regional strategy to counter the @entity4 regime 's malign influence , we will continue to harm @entity13 national security interests , as well as our relationships with our closest regional allies and partners , in pursuit of the illusory goal of rapprochement with the current @entity4 leadership			1
the consequences of this ill - conceived bargain would destroy the @entity121 ' last best chance to live in freedom from the brutal @entity124 regime			0
" @entity6 kills 300 members of @entity127 tribe @entity129 spokeswoman @entity128 said @entity13 - @entity4 nuclear talks are n't linked to @entity13 cooperation with @entity4 in combating @entity6			1
" we do n't look at it as a linked situation , " she said			0
" our concerns about @entity4 's engagement are more expansive than that			0
obviously , we understand that they have concerns about the threat of @entity6 , which they have expressed as well , but i would not look at it as a path to a different type of coordination			0
" while the @entity13 acknowledged notifying @entity4 before striking in @entity121 earlier this year , administration officials have said there is no cooperation between the countries in combating @entity6			1
secretary of state @entity150 said there would be no " cooperation , " but the @entity13 wanted to " de-conflict			0
" " the @entity13 will not cooperate militarily with @entity4 in that effort			2
we wo n't share intelligence with them			0
but their interests in the outcome is something that 's been widely commented on -- commented upon and something that on a couple of occasions has been discussed on the sidelines of other conversations , " @entity67 said			0
@entity55 general to @entity6 : we can hear you while there are many other concerning aspects of @entity4 behavior for the @entity13 , including human rights and @entity13 in captivity , the nuclear deal is seen as the major impediment , one of the sources said			1
the administration did not notify its @entity101 allies in @entity180 or the @entity181 about the letter , the other source said			0
in september , @entity9 said he rejected @entity13 overtures to join the @entity13 - led coalition against @entity6			2
report : children say @entity6 captured , beat them on way home from exams in comments released by @entity4 's @entity192 news agency , @entity9 detailed what he called " @entity13 demands for cooperation			1
" " during the hard days of @entity199 's attacks on @entity18 , the @entity13 ambassador to @entity18 demanded our envoy in the country ( @entity18 ) that @entity4 and the @entity13 meet for negotiations and coordination on @entity204 , " @entity9 said , using a derogatory nickname for @entity6			1
" our ambassador reflected the issue to @entity4 and although some officials did n't voice opposition , i opposed it and said we will not cooperate with the @entity13 in this regard since they have a corrupt intention and stained hands and how could we have cooperation with the @entity13 under such conditions ? " referring to @entity150 's comments that @entity4 would not be invited to join the @entity216 coalition , @entity9 said , according to @entity192 , " the same @entity13 secretary of state had personally demanded ( @entity4 foreign minister ) dr. ( @entity218 , and called for cooperation with us on @entity204 but dr. @entity218 had rejected his demand			2
" he added that acting deputy secretary of state @entity223 , the lead @entity13 negotiator in the nuclear talks , " repeated the same demand for cooperation with @entity4 " with her counterparts			1
opinion : why @entity227 must roll back military involvement in @entity18 , @entity121 @entity1 has made at least two other overtures to the @entity9 since taking office in 2009			0
news of the letter angered congressional opponents of a nuclear deal with @entity4			0
they are already deeply discomforted by details of a possible agreement that have been emerging ahead of an end - of - november deadline			0
one senior @entity95 congressional staffer told @entity16 's @entity239 that the letter was sending " shock waves " through @entity240 and suggested it would also anger @entity180 and @entity13 allies in the @entity101 who think the president is already going behind their backs to negotiate a " bad deal " with @entity4 .			2

sources say @entity1 noted @entity4 , @entity13 both interested in defeating @entity6
@entity13 is deep into talks with @entity4 about its nuclear capabilities
sources say that 's the main block to the countries cooperating on @entity6
