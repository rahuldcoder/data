-- what have unions done for us lately ? other than give us @entity4 , and a three - day weekend to start football season			1
the answers may surprise you			0
unions have long been part of our nation 's history , fighting for better pay , safer working conditions , health care and retirement benefits , education and civic participation			1
unions have brought diverse voices together , and their struggles have elevated the working conditions , the standard of living and the recognition of not just their members , but of all who labor			1
unions played a major role in ending the sweatshops and child labor so common at the beginning of the 20th century			2
the @entity32 , or @entity32 , was one of the first unions to have a primarily female membership			1
and in the aftermath of the tragic @entity37 in 1911 , in which more than 100 mostly young immigrant women were killed , the @entity32 was at the forefront of reforming working conditions and pushing for comprehensive safety and workers ' compensation laws			1
unions are n't a " thing of the past			2
" they 're a vital part of our social fabric and economic future			0
did you know , for example , that unions run the largest career training program outside the military ? @entity32 apprenticeship programs generally partner with employers or industries to provide the kind of training that hard - wires excellence into workers and places them in good jobs that can support families			2
that 's worth a lot when unemployment is stubbornly high and personal incomes are falling			0
i challenge you to watch this quick video about union - trained military vets who are rebuilding the @entity77 without getting misty - eyed			2
did you know that union letter carriers save lives all the time by alerting officials when an elderly person has n't collected her mail from the mailbox ? that firefighters are fighting breast cancer ? that in @entity89 , @entity90 , union members arranged haircuts for more than 700 kids going back to school ? in just about every community , the union movement partners with the @entity95 , and together they do amazing things -- from cleaning up after storms to building wheelchair ramps and running food banks			1
unions have had their problems -- what organizations do not ? -- and it 's convenient for some politicians to belittle the contribution or usefulness of unions			2
indeed , much of the public has lost touch with what unions do and who they are			2
unions are just folks -- people who come together to improve their lives and their workplaces , because there 's strength in numbers			1
the one thing the public does know is that union members , thanks to collective bargaining , have higher wages and better benefits			1
but union membership actually raises living and working standards for all working men and women -- union and non-union			1
when union membership rates are high , so is the share of income that goes to the middle class			1
when those rates fall , income inequality grows -- the middle class shrinks and the 1 % gets richer			1
collective bargaining affects more than wages and benefits			2
@entity32 teachers bargain for smaller class sizes			2
@entity32 nurses bargain for better patient care			0
when they 're successful -- when they 're not shut down by @entity151 - type governors -- we all win			0
working together , union members and their community allies also make up a powerful lobby for the common good			1
they 've helped secure for us all the eight - hour day , job safety laws , overtime pay , @entity158 and @entity159 , civil rights protections , fair treatment for women and lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender workers and much more			0
these are some of the reasons even people who do n't fit the stereotypes of union members have formed unions			1
taxi drivers in @entity175 , who are getting health care for the first time			0
writers and directors for tv shows			0
go to a movie and you 're enjoying the work of one of @entity189 's most unionized industries , from the actors and camera crews to set designers			0
but maybe the most important contribution of unions has to do with basic dignity			0
@entity196 , @entity197 , sanitation workers , aspiring to become @entity200 members , picked up signs that declared proudly , " @entity202 , " and formed the setting for the rev. @entity205 's " @entity206 " speech			0
one of the core tenets of unionism is that all work has dignity			0
and all the people who perform it deserve respect			0
so even as @entity4 recedes , say " thank you " to someone whose work you respect and rely on			0
and thank a union for the weekend while you 're at it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity221 .			1
