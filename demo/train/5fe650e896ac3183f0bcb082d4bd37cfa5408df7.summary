-- influential @entity3 rock band @entity1 announced on tuesday they will reform for several concerts next year after a 15 - year hiatus			1
the big question is : will they be any good ? i 've certainly got high hopes for the reunion shows			0
one thing the @entity14 band -- noted for their mix of psychedelic rock and dance rhythms -- always prided themselves on was their ability as musicians and @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 were a very tight unit live			1
those three in particular will want to make sure the gigs are as tight and musically stunning as possible , not only for their own reputations , but to improve @entity1 ' legacy			1
those of us who saw them at @entity33 ( without @entity34 and @entity23 , who had left by then ) were horrified by the extremely poor show the band called @entity1 put on			1
i could n't stand it and had to leave early			0
watch @entity1 ' press conference these shows will have to be good to erase that stain			1
there 's always a bit of a question about @entity46 's tuning , but that 's almost part of his charm as a frontman			0
he 's good on vibes			0
the issue of whether it 's right for old bands to attempt to recreate their glory days depends on the context			0
bands who have reached their peak fade away and then comeback tend to do themselves no favors			0
but when there is unfinished business -- for example when @entity68 fell out with @entity69 in 2000 it did n't feel like a fitting end for such a seminal band -- reunions give the fans what they want : a chance to see a band one more time and a better end to their relationship with that group			1
watch the band in their heyday when the fans are n't interested , or bothered , then you know it 's just for the money and it 's just sad			2
i think @entity1 had a lot of unfinished business			2
in an era where music is consumed so quickly , the return of older bands does give fans a chance to experience something a bit more substantial and emotionally satisfying than contemporary acts ; it 's harder to have that kind of relationship with a band who are old hat after just one single			1
however it does make it harder for bands to progress their careers , if reformed acts are soaking up a lot of the live market for example			1
for example very few new bands who emerged in the last 10 years have been trusted to headline a major summer festival , organizers will not take a gamble on new talent , if there 's a sure - thing reunion lurking around			2
it 's a tough balance , but it 's reflective of most people 's record collections -- a mix of old and new music			0
so we 'll have to see if there is an artistic justification for a resurrected @entity1			2
@entity68 in 2009 in particular felt justified , not only because we got to see how a artistically mature @entity133 and @entity69 would perform together live -- rather than going mental as they did a bit in the early days -- but they also recorded the single " @entity137 " which was a welcome addition to the @entity68 catalog , and their @entity140 performance was one of their greatest in that festival 's already esteemed history .			0
