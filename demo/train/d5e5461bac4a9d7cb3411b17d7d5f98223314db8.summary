-- there 's a lot of head - scratching at the @entity4 over an article in @entity7 magazine that dubs @entity8 , the founder of the notorious private military contractor @entity9 , a " tycoon , contractor , soldier , spy			1
" in the piece , he comes across as so entrenched with the @entity4 that the agency needs him to perform the most sensitive secret missions , including those involving hunting down and taking out @entity21 operatives			1
it 's true that @entity8 , as the sole owner of one of the most well - connected private military contractors in modern history , is in a position of enormous trust within the government			1
so why is it that he 's lashing out publicly at that same government ? @entity8 , a 40 - year - old former @entity32 , inherited what he called a sizable amount of money when his father died in the late ' 90s			1
he 's used that money to help climb to the top of an industry that has mushroomed since the invasion of @entity42 in 2001			2
he built @entity9 , now operating under the name @entity9 , from the ground up , into a sprawling complex with enough tanks , planes and ammunition to launch a small war of its own			2
when president @entity51 addressed the nation and talked about his @entity42 strategy , he did n't talk about the shadow army already employed there			2
there are more private contractors in @entity42 on the @entity58 payroll than there are @entity58 troops			1
while @entity8 is a huge beneficiary of @entity58 contract dollars , he has long been frustrated by two things			1
first , he does n't like the reputation his company has gained , with his men painted as ruthless cowboys -- which some are , but some are n't			0
second , he believes some people in the government just do n't appreciate him the way they should			2
prince uses the @entity7 article to re-air a lot of his complaints , but the story contains a great deal of classified information , with details about covert programs that involved him			0
so does that mean that when convenient , he uses that information to help express his frustration ? @entity8 unabashedly criticizes parts of the government he does n't like			1
and some current and former government sources question whether that 's a smart move			0
they ask whether , as a man who benefits financially from those contracts , he should really go public with his criticisms of the same government that signs his checks			0
although the @entity4 has never publicly confirmed @entity8 's involvement -- it has become common knowledge in the industry he disclosed details of that relationship to me , among many other things , in the book i wrote on him that was published earlier this year			1
a lot of those details came up again in this latest article , but @entity8 went even further this time			1
the @entity7 article reports that @entity8 is " privately and secretly doing the @entity4 's bidding , helping to craft , fund and execute operations ranging from inserting personnel into " denied areas , " places @entity58 intelligence has trouble penetrating , to assembling hit teams targeting @entity21 members and their allies			1
" some former @entity4 officials are , quite frankly , annoyed			1
not only do they believe that @entity8 is overplaying any role he may have had or still has with the agency , but they believe he is exploiting it for personal gain			2
few of the sources i talked with wanted their names associated with @entity8 or his company , but when asked about the @entity7 article , @entity4 spokesman @entity125 told me the agency has never " talked about what role contractors may or may not have played in ... initiatives over the years			1
but what no one should forget or overlook is the fact that this agency has the talent , tools , and authorities to go after terrorists , and has done so successfully			0
" in other words : we can do our own jobs just fine , thank you very much , mr. @entity8			2
another source with former ties to the @entity4 was outraged by the article , saying that @entity8 was putting a target on the backs of his own men by alluding to a close relationship between @entity9 and the agency			1
he fears that all around the world , @entity9 contractors would be perceived as agents of the @entity4			1
a government official who also thought that the article exaggerated @entity8 's role in the @entity4 put it this way : " @entity9 has good people			1
they do hard work , sharing the burdens of service overseas			0
but they 're not well - served by strange tales , the kind of stuff you saw in @entity7 about miraculous penetrations of hard intelligence targets or private assassination squads with their fingers on the trigger			0
" that should all be shelved under fiction , the kind of stories that end with the alarm clock going off and mom calling you down to breakfast , " the official said			0
what the article does n't say is just how much of a @entity180 headache @entity8 has become			2
one of the lessons that has come with the marriage between private and military is that for a private business , @entity180 can be crucial to your survival ; for a covert operation , it can be deadly			0
striking a balance between the two has been the source of much hand - wringing in @entity193			0
but no matter how you feel about private military contracting , it is here to stay			0
all of the major @entity58 agencies -- the @entity199 , the @entity197 , the @entity4 -- do business with @entity8 , and all are dependent on contractors in @entity203 and @entity42			1
i flew with @entity8 to @entity42 shortly after the shootings in a @entity207 traffic circle in september of 2007 that killed 17 people			1
@entity210 pleaded not guilty and are awaiting trial ; a fifth struck a deal with prosecutors			0
@entity8 's frustration was obvious			2
he felt like he had given everything to his country and that his country had let him down in countless ways ; namely by not defending him publicly when his company came under fire after the shootings			0
@entity8 says he does what he does for love of country , but of course , he does n't do it for free			2
his companies have received well over a billion dollars in the process			0
i asked his spokesperson to comment on concerns that @entity8 might be jeopardizing agency programs by going public with the details -- after all , he does have a security clearance			0
the response was this : " truth is he is a quiet hero , a great patriot and @entity58			0
we need more men like him			0
" quiet ? really ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity243 .			0
