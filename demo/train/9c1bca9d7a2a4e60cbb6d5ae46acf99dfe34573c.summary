over the weekend on his trip to @entity2 , secretary of state @entity0 implored the global community to take action on climate change , calling it " the greatest challenge of our generation			1
" speaking to students , he underscored what we all know to be true : that climate change is an undeniable fact and a danger that we can no longer afford to ignore			2
around the globe , president @entity14 and his chief diplomat are pressing for urgent action to combat the effects of climate change and reduce carbon pollution before we pass the point of no return			1
but the decision that will either solidify or irrevocably weaken @entity14 's legacy as a leader on climate change lies much closer to home in the proposed @entity27 , which would pump heavy tar sands crude through @entity31 's heartland			1
the world was watching in june when the president drew a line in the sand during his speech at @entity36 , where he declared that the @entity27 would be approved only if " the project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution			2
" today , the world is still watching , and if president @entity14 is to remain a global climate leader , his choice is clear			1
@entity27 fails the president 's climate test , and he must reject it			1
if approved , @entity27 will unlock the @entity46 tar sands , spur investment in and production of dirty fossil fuels at an irreversible rate and undermine the president 's global efforts to reduce carbon emissions			1
and while the flawed @entity54 released by the @entity55 last month was touted by @entity56 as proof that the @entity27 would not substantially increase carbon emissions , substantial oversights and serious questions about the report 's integrity mean this question is far from resolved			2
oil industry apologists insist that the @entity27 will not have an impact on carbon pollution , because without it , the tar sands would come out of the ground anyway			2
but the oil industry has acknowledged that it needs additional pipeline capacity to keep up with increasing production			2
a report by the @entity73 predicts that existing pipelines will be full by the end of 2014			0
and @entity27 , which would transport up to 830,000 barrels per day , is only part of the solution			0
to meet its aggressive 2030 production goals , the industry would need all five of its proposed pipeline projects and then would still fall short			0
others claim that rail is a viable alternative to pipelines and that the tar sands will be developed with or without new pipeline capacity			0
but they are ignoring key facts			0
industry and @entity91 officials have conceded that rail is not a substitute for @entity27 in terms of capacity			0
not only that , rail is significantly more expensive			0
the @entity55 estimates that shipping tar sands by pipeline costs about $ 8 to $ 10 per barrel			0
make the switch to rail , and the price shoots up to $ 15 to $ 17 per barrel , with some estimates as high as $ 31			0
for investors , that means rail is only a short - term solution to get the tar sands to market , not a long - term economical alternative to new pipelines			0
the truth is , the oil industry needs to build a pipeline straight through the @entity31 to access refineries on the @entity115 , which allows tar sands oil to be sold at higher world market prices			1
@entity27 means producers ' profit margins go up , and we 're locked into an endless cycle of investment , production and pollution			0
at the end of the day , @entity27 is not just another oil pipeline ; it 's a gateway to the unchecked development of one of the world 's dirtiest fossil fuels			1
secretary @entity0 was right : climate change is the greatest challenge of our generation , and it is our responsibility to preserve our planet for generations to come			1
but @entity31 can not lead the fight on climate change abroad while allowing even more pollution to be produced in our own backyard			1
to truly be a global leader on climate change , president @entity14 must first make the right choices here at home			1
he must deny the @entity27 .			0

@entity148 : secretary @entity0 rightly called climate change one of our greatest challenges
@entity148 : if president @entity14 is to be a climate leader , he must reject the @entity27 pipeline
@entity148 : pipeline unlocks tar sand oil and leads to unchecked development of dirty fossil fuels
he says @entity31 ca *n't* lead on climate change abroad while polluting our own backyard more
