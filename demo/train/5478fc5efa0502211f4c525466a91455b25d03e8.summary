-- a change in tactics among @entity5 's militants is threatening to bring their nationalist fight to the heart of @entity9 's cities , terrorism analysts fear			1
the warning came as @entity9 investigators said they believed @entity13 rebels were responsible for monday 's twin suicide bombings in @entity16 's subway network that killed at least 39 people			1
the @entity9 - @entity5 conflict dates back nearly 20 years , with @entity5 having laid claim to land in the @entity22 region			2
thousands have been killed and 500,000 @entity13 people have been displaced from the fighting			0
the area is located in the @entity28 region of @entity9 between the black and @entity30 seas			0
read how @entity13 rebels threaten @entity9 stability for the last five years the war has been largely fought in the @entity34 but , according to terrorism analyst @entity35 , the tide has been turning against the rebels			1
" they do n't have the same sort of supply chain they used to have , " he said , adding that pressure from the @entity9 military had taken its toll			0
now there are suspicions that @entity47 , the 45 - year - old self - styled emir of the @entity9 @entity28 , is taking the battle into @entity9 itself			0
until now @entity47 , a veteran of @entity5 's nationalist fight with @entity9 , has been against killing civilians			1
he was critical of the @entity52 attack in which @entity13 rebels took 1,200 people as hostages at a school in @entity52 in 2004			1
in the ensuing gun battles between the rebels and @entity9 forces , 334 hostages were killed , more than 100 of them schoolchildren			2
@entity9 authorities however say @entity47 played a lead role in the @entity52 attack and that he has been responsible for bombings on mainline trains and markets			1
while he has not claimed responsibility for monday 's subway bombings , if he is behind them , it would demonstrate a change in tactics due partly , analysts suspect , to a reliance on funding to continue the fight from radical islamists such as @entity78			1
" it 's got to the stage where the @entity5 in particular are potentially looking out to the global jihad for that level of support , " said @entity35			0
" by aligning himself to @entity78 or other members of global jihad it would certainly be one source of securing that funding			0
" a possible key weapon at @entity47 's disposal as he wages war on @entity9 are female suicide bombers , the so - called " @entity93 " who are believed to be behind monday 's coordinated blasts , typical of an @entity78 attack			1
" @entity98 is much more considered traditional for women rather than for men , " explains @entity9 security analyst @entity97 , " in @entity13 culture it 's a different perception of suicide bombing than we have in the @entity105			2
" the @entity93 are believed to be made up of women whose husbands , brothers , fathers or other relatives have been killed in the conflict			0
the women are often dressed head - to - toe in black and wear the so - called " martyr 's belt " filled with explosives			0
female suicide bombers have been involved in several attacks in @entity9 and first came to prominence in 2002 when 18 women were among a group of separatists who threatened to blow up a @entity16 theater seized in the middle of a musical			1
in the rescue attempt by @entity9 special forces , 115 hostages and 50 @entity13 separatists were killed			2
" the majority of them have been recruited because they 've someone close to them because they lost a husband , a brother , a cousin ... and all of them indoctrinated , brainwashed , " said @entity35			0
" they are very much exploited			0
in 2002 we saw between 40 and 50 gunmen storm the @entity16 theater ... not a single one of them was suicide bombers ... all the suicide bombers were females			2
" @entity93 were also among the 32 - strong group of heavily - armed @entity13 rebels who took approximately 1,200 people as hostages in @entity52 in 2004			1
@entity16 subway attacks bear mark of ' @entity93 ' if @entity47 has as many women at his disposal now , @entity16 may indeed be facing in @entity47 's words a " war unleashed on its streets			0
