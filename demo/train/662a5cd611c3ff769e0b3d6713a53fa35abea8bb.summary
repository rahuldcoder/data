" i hope that you will all vigorously go after who was the source and purpose as you did go after the story at the time , " he told reporters			0

" i never agreed to be recorded			0
" in addition to criticism over accepting unreported plane flights and allegedly advocating on behalf of a business , @entity1 was accused of partying with prostitutes in the @entity4 -- accusations he said were " unsubstantiated			1
" as he did when the claims first emerged , @entity1 said tuesday the claims are " false smears " lifted from right - wing blogs ahead of the election			1
@entity1 faces scrutiny over ties to @entity46 doctor " look , i do n't know more than what i have read			2
but i do know from the very beginning i have said that nameless , faceless , anonymous sources ... from the right wing blogs took this story which was just false smears right before an election cycle , attempted to do it then , and ultimately drove it into the mainstream press , " he said			1
" but they were never anything other than false smears			1
" the confession document was presented at a press conference monday by lawyer @entity60 , who said @entity20 was recruited to make the claims against @entity1 by another lawyer , dr. @entity62			2
@entity62 , in a notarized confession , pins the blame on a third lawyer , who @entity62 said asked him to assist in a divorce case by finding " witnesses " to claim they had sex for money with @entity1			1
@entity0 has attempted to reach both the lawyers who allegedly recorded the escort making the claims against @entity1 , but has not yet received a response			2

in january , @entity1 paid approximately $ 58,500 to @entity76 for the flights he took in 2010 , chalking up the lapse in payment to his busy schedule			2

the @entity113 , a conservative website , originally published the video with two women claiming they had sex with @entity1 for money			1
