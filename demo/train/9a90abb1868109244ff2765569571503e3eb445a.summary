-- the wife of fugitive @entity5 leader @entity4 , three of his children and some of his grandchildren arrived in @entity2 on monday morning , @entity2 diplomats said			1
@entity8 , the @entity2 ambassador to the @entity9 , said he relayed the news to @entity12 ban ki - moon earlier monday			2
@entity8 said his country granted entrance to @entity4 's wife , @entity15 , his daughter , @entity15 , sons @entity16 and @entity18 and their children on " humanitarian grounds			1
" " we made sure the international community has been informed , " said @entity8			0
the ambassador said he did not know whether @entity4 was expected to seek entry into @entity2 and claimed none of the @entity26 were subject to @entity28 sanctions			1
in fact , @entity29 1970 , passed on february 26 , includes the names of all three @entity4 children who are now in @entity2 as being subject to a " travel ban " because of their " closeness of association with ( the ) regime			1
" the @entity9 ban requires " all member states " to prevent them and others listed from entering their territories , unless there is some special circumstance that the council agrees warrants an exception			0
the resolution also allows the nation -- in this case , @entity2 -- to determine " on a case - by - case basis that such entry or transit is required to advance peace and stability ( and ) notifies the committee within 48 hours after making such a determination			2
" news on monday of the @entity4 relatives ' departure from @entity5 came the same day that a senior rebel commander reported that @entity61 , a son of the @entity5 leader and military commander in his regime , had been killed sunday night			1
@entity65 , the vice chairman of the rebels ' @entity66 , the military wing of the @entity69 , said @entity61 died in a battle with rebel forces between the villages of @entity73 and @entity74 in northwest @entity5			1
@entity61 , who was a senior military commander under his father , was taken to a hospital where he died from his injuries , said @entity65			0
he was then buried in the area by rebel forces , @entity65 said			0
his father , @entity4 , meanwhile , is still wanted by the @entity80 in the @entity81 on charges of war crimes			2
so , too , is @entity4 's son @entity84 and his brother - in - law and intelligence chief , @entity86			2
but should any of those three get to @entity2 , there is no guarantee they would face trial			2
@entity2 is not a signatory of the @entity93 that established the @entity80			2
the longtime ruler 's whereabouts have been a mystery since the rebels overran @entity98 last week			0
rebel commanders said @entity4 was not found in the network of tunnels beneath his @entity103 compound , and reports that he had been holed up in an apartment block nearby or at a farm near @entity98 's airport did n't pan out			2
the @entity69 , which is forming a provisional government in @entity98 since overrunning the city last week , has not yet confirmed the news about @entity4 's family members , spokesman @entity107 told @entity0			1
but he said that if true , the @entity69 would demand the return of the family members			2
he promised they would receive a fair trial			0
the rebels had previously speculated that @entity4 could be trying to reach @entity2 or @entity5 's southern neighbor @entity117 , both countries with which his government had close ties			1
" those are the only two neighboring countries that have been showing support for him , " @entity122 , an @entity69 official based in @entity123 , said last week			2
in @entity127 , @entity123 's @entity126 said the fate of @entity4 's relatives " is a matter for the @entity69			1
" in @entity133 , @entity132 spokesman @entity131 told reporters the @entity135 has no indication @entity4 has left @entity5			1
on monday night , a senior official in president @entity139 's administration -- speaking on condition of anonymity , given the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue -- said the @entity5 leader 's wife and three children are believed to be in the @entity2 government 's custody			1
the official echoed earlier comments from @entity152 spokeswoman @entity151 that what 's important is that @entity4 and his relatives , wherever they are , are held accountable			1
" we want to see justice and accountability for @entity4 and those members of his family with blood on their hands and those members of his regime with blood on their hands , " @entity151 said			0
" but it 'll be a decision of the @entity5 people , ( as to ) how that goes forward			0
" @entity2 , which the @entity171 says has a population of 35 million , repeatedly has been mentioned as a possible destination for @entity4 and his family			1
@entity122 , the @entity123 - based coordinator for @entity5 's @entity69 , said earlier this month that @entity2 and @entity117 " are the only two neighboring countries that have been showing support for him			1
" @entity177 , director of the @entity178 at the @entity179 , noted similarities between @entity5 under @entity4 and @entity2 , with a largely oil - driven economy and strong central government under president @entity183 " that is concerned with popular uprisings			1
" " my sense is that @entity2 was supportive , in part , because they had worked out a modus vivendi ( or , practical compromise ) with @entity4 and they feared the contagion of mass popular unrest in the region , " @entity177 said			1
yet while many nations in @entity197 had determined " it was easier to manage ( @entity4 ) than to defeat him , " especially when he shared some oil - derived wealth around the continent , @entity177 said he finds it unlikely any nation will now risk international scorn by taking in the embattled leader himself -- or that @entity4 would ever leave @entity5			1
of @entity4 's family members now in @entity2 , @entity203 was a good will ambassador for the @entity205 and has kept a low profile during the six - month revolt against her father			1
she had been named to the position in 2009 to address @entity210 and violence against women in @entity5 , but @entity9 officials terminated her position as @entity4 unleashed his military on anti-government protesters early in the conflict			1
she is due to give birth in early september , sources close to her family told @entity0			0
@entity222 is a headline maker			0
he has reportedly paid millions of dollars for private parties featuring big - name entertainers including @entity226 , @entity227 and @entity228			0
several of the artists now say they have given the money back			0
rebels who picked through his seaside villa on sunday also introduced @entity0 's @entity234 to his family 's badly burned former nanny , who said she had been doused with boiling water by his wife , model @entity238 , when she refused to beat one of their crying toddlers			0
the nanny , @entity243 , is covered with scars from the abuse , which was corroborated by another member of the household staff			0
@entity16 was also accused of a string of violent incidents in @entity250 , including beating his staff and his wife			0
charges were dropped in the case of his staff , and @entity238 later said her broken nose was the result of an accident			0
in another high - profile episode , @entity16 was stopped after driving his @entity260 90 mph the wrong way on the @entity262 in @entity263			0
@entity265 , meanwhile , was one of three @entity4 sons who had been reported captured as the rebels overran @entity98 last week			0
but the rebels said he had escaped the next day			0
@entity0 's @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 and @entity272 contributed to this report .			0
