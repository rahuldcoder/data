the three men pleaded guilty to violating the @entity34 and @entity35 but denied the truck and @entity3 equipment were theirs , the state paper reported			1

@entity1 " once had the highest literary rate in @entity116 and a vibrant media system , " @entity108 said , but since the elections , draconian press laws had increasingly limited the access to information			1
