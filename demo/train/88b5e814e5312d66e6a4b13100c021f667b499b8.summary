-- as fears rise around emergence of a " two - speed " eurozone , the head of @entity6 clothing giant @entity5 says the region 's southern economies should not be discounted			1
the eurozone 's debt crisis has exacerbated a split between the strong economies , led by @entity13 , and those which are struggling , such as @entity6			1
however @entity15 , deputy executive chairman of the retailer -- which has 6,400 stores across 120 countries -- told @entity0 : " @entity13 needs @entity20 just as much as @entity20 needs @entity13			1
" while @entity5 acknowledges southern @entity20 is not producing as much as its northern counterparts , he said they should not be ignored			1
" if @entity13 thinks it can do it by itself without @entity20 , i think it 's wrong because in a global market the critical mass is important , " he said			1
political tensions between @entity13 and countries such as @entity6 , and @entity28 , which triggered the crisis , have intensified as the crisis continues to roll on			1
but @entity15 said countries including his homeland still have a role to play in the eurozone			1
" rather than throwing them out of the boat , i think you should encourage them to behave better , " he said			0
@entity5 is talking from experience -- the former investment banker was brought into the family business when the clothing chain was being challenged by cheaper , fast - fashion brands			2
the brand also faced down controversy last year with its " unhate " campaign featuring international leaders kissing each other			0
the campaign was cut after doctored images of the pope kissing a male @entity53 cleric which were labeled by some as offensive			0
controversies aside , the company remains a family business with @entity15 's father , @entity59 , chairman of the group			2
and it is this family structure which remains the backbone of @entity6 business , with 90 % of the country 's economy based on @entity67			0
@entity5 acknowledges there are problems associated with that			0
" if the cost of the money is too high for the bank , it will not be accessible to small entrepreneurs and that can be very dangerous , " he said			0
@entity15 said @entity6 's major problems are its aging population and high youth unemployment , rather than its ability to repay debt			2
" it 's not whether we will be able to pay , a company that grows with a business model that is successful always pays it debts , " he said			0
" it is just a matter of time			0
