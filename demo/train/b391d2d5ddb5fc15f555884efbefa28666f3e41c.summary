-- if you 're a die - hard baseball or basketball fan , @entity1 just made your day			0
with its latest software update for @entity6 , @entity4 is now offering easy streaming of @entity9 and @entity10 games directly through its $ 100 media - streaming unit			1
all you need an active subscription to either service , and you can have unlimited access to every baseball and basketball game through your @entity6 , subject to local blackout rules , of course			0
@entity20 streaming had previously been available for @entity21 and @entity22 , but built - in @entity6 functionality brings an ease of use and integration previously unseen			2
there are two subscription models for @entity20 , $ 100 a year for standard and $ 120 for the premium offering ( which boasts home and away broadcasts , in - game dvr capability , and different camera options )			1
@entity34 has also been available for online streaming and directly mobile apps for @entity37 and @entity38 , and the @entity4 tv bundle comes in two sizes : a $ 65 option if you pick seven teams to watch , as well as $ 100 for unlimited streaming			1
( although , real penny - pinchers could just purchase the mobile version , which costs $ 70 less than the @entity6 version , and just @entity48 that to your hdtv , another new feature of @entity38			0
) how much more business will the move bring in for @entity4 , @entity9 and the @entity10 ? millions of dollars over time , although much more @entity6 penetration will be needed before that comes to bear			1
( it 's been less than three months since the company announced sales of 1 million @entity4 tvs			0
) but if you 're a sports fan who has been hesitant to plunk down a @entity63 for @entity4 's media - streaming marvel , this update just made your resistance all the more futile			2
