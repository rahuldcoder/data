-- @entity2 kingmaker or entertainer ? truth teller or " big fat idiot " ? how about " lightning rod " ? once again , @entity7 -- the conservative provocateur with the self - described " talent on loan from @entity11 " -- is in hot water			1
@entity7 , who has been the leading talk - radio host for more than two decades , ignited this most recent controversy when he made comments about @entity17 law student @entity16 , who had testified as an advocate for contraception at a @entity21 hearing			1
" what does it say about the college co-ed @entity16 , who goes before a congressional committee and essentially says she must be paid to have sex ? " @entity7 asked on his show last wednesday			2
" what does that make her ? it makes her a slut , right ? it makes her a prostitute			0
she wants to be paid to have sex			0
she 's having so much sex , she ca n't afford the contraception			0
she wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to have sex			0
" his remarks set off a major outcry , prompting top @entity2 and @entity47 alike to denounce the famed talk show host			2
@entity7 apologized saturday , saying his " choice of words was not the best , and in the attempt to be humorous , i created a national stir			1
" he added , " i sincerely apologize to ms. @entity16 for the insulting word choices			0
" the damage , however , has been done			0
eight companies , including @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 , have announced they will pull ads from @entity7 's show , the no. 1 radio show in @entity62			1
what effect this will have on @entity7 -- and the 600 - plus radio stations his show airs on -- is anyone 's guess			1
@entity7 's situation is complicated by the politics of his show , said @entity72 , founder and publisher of @entity74 , which covers the talk industry			1
talk radio " has such a high profile and so much buzz factor , people tend to give these big - time talk - show hosts " far more sway than they actually have , @entity72 said			1
" people who see things through the political lens only see things politically			0
" but politics is only part of the story , he said			0
" the fact is , he 's primarily an entertainer			0
" glory in fury the @entity16 controversy is far from the first time @entity7 has made controversial statements -- or backtracked			1
in 2006 , @entity7 mocked @entity97 's - afflicted actor @entity96 after @entity98 appeared in a political commercial for @entity101 sen. @entity100			1
he later offered a conditional apology : " i will bigly , hugely admit that i was wrong , and i will apologize to @entity96 , if i am wrong in characterizing his behavior on this commercial as an act			0
" three years earlier , @entity7 resigned from @entity107 's " @entity106 " after igniting a controversy with statements about @entity111 quarterback @entity110			1
" my comments this past sunday were directed at the media and were not racially motivated			0
i offered an opinion , " @entity7 said			2
" this opinion has caused discomfort to the crew , which i regret			0
" @entity7 has also mocked presidential children @entity119 ( " the most unattractive presidential daughter in the history of the country " ) and @entity120 ( comparing her to a dog )			2
both times , he apologized , though some critics questioned the spirit of his regret			0
his words still carry weight within the @entity2 , and just as often raise the hackles of his ideological opponents			2
@entity7 often glories in their fury , letting fly with such terms as " feminazis " ( " @entity137 was established so as to allow unattractive women easier access to the mainstream of society , " he once said ) , " caller abortions " ( disconnecting unwanted callers ) , " banking queen " ( for the openly gay congressman and @entity147 member @entity146 ) and " state - run media " ( mainstream media )			1
indeed , before a number of advertisers had announced their intent , @entity7 doubled down on the @entity16 controversy			1
after president @entity154 called the student , @entity7 mocked the story on his show			1
" the president called her to make sure she 's ok , " @entity7 said			1
" what is she , 30 years old ? thirty years old , a student at @entity161 , who admits to having so much sex that she ca n't afford it anymore			2
" @entity7 has been stoking passions since he first went on the air as a talk - show host in 1984 , replacing the equally outrageous @entity168 in @entity169 , @entity170			1
previously , @entity7 -- part of a noted southeast @entity101 @entity2 family -- had worked as a music dj under the name @entity175 and as director of promotions for the @entity177			2
in @entity169 , he found his exaggerated " @entity7 " persona and set about raising ratings and emotion in equal measure			1
by 1988 , he had moved to @entity182 and his show went national			0
he quickly became a star , reaching more than 5 million listeners for his " @entity186 " by 1991			0
( current numbers are difficult to determine , says @entity72 , but @entity74 believes @entity7 reaches 15 million people a week			2
) " @entity191 " stood for " @entity191 " -- a typical mock - heroic @entity7 touch befitting his golden voice			1
even those who disagree with him acknowledge his radio talent			0
" @entity7 is just an amazing radio performer , " " @entity197 " host @entity196 told the @entity198 in a 2008 @entity7 profile by @entity200 , who later wrote a @entity7 biography			1
" years ago , i used to listen in the car on my way to reporting gigs , and i 'd notice that i disagreed with everything he was saying , yet i not only wanted to keep listening , i actually liked him			0
you can count on two hands the number of public figures in @entity62 who can pull that trick off			0
" the power of the bully pulpit @entity7 also became a power within the @entity2 , using his bully pulpit to promote conservative views and denigrate @entity47 and their fellow travelers			2
the @entity2 appreciated the boost , naming him an honorary member of the 1994 " @entity225 " congressional freshman class			0
he branched out , writing best - selling books -- the first two were titled " @entity7 " and " @entity7 " -- and starting a syndicated tv talk show , which was produced by future @entity229 head @entity228			1
@entity7 's popularity naturally led to detractors			1
perhaps the most publicly outspoken was comedian @entity232 , who ripped @entity7 's books with his own , titled " @entity234 and other observations			1
" that book , along with regular @entity238 appearances opposite such political personalities as @entity240 , helped establish @entity232 as a left - wing force			2
the @entity242 is now one of @entity244 's @entity62 senators			0
given the mockery @entity7 dishes out , his personal life has left him open to jokes			2
he 's been divorced three times ; he married his fourth wife , @entity250 , in 2010			0
he 's struggled with weight problems			0
he suffered from addiction to pain medication and was named during a 2003 investigation into a black market drug ring in @entity256 , @entity257			0
he also was detained by drug enforcement agents in 2006 after returning from the @entity259			0
the agents confiscated a supply of @entity262 ; the prescription was not in @entity7 's name			1
@entity47 leaders have also found limbaugh a useful target , making him the center of a 2009 advertising campaign			0
over the years , several @entity2 have backed off positions on issues after being taken to task by @entity7			1
in 2009 , rep. @entity272 , @entity273 , criticized @entity7 and fellow conservative talk - show host @entity274 for their attacks on the congressional @entity2 leadership ; he apologized within 24 hours			1
other republicans have spoken out against handling @entity7 with kid gloves			2
" the problem i 'm having with the party right now is when he says things that i consider to be completely outrageous , i would like to see other members of the party do likewise , and they do n't , " former secretary of state @entity279 told @entity0 in 2009			0
@entity279 had been a subject of @entity7 's gibes			1
talkers publisher @entity72 -- who describes @entity7 personally as " basically a shy man , " sensitive to slights but " intelligent enough to have overcome his emotions and stay out of the public profile " -- believes that @entity7 will weather this storm , as he has so many others			2
" i suspect he will come through this , because @entity7 is not an elected official , he 's not a clergyman , he 's not a member of the government , he 's just basically in the same business @entity301 is in , " he said			1
" in the end , all of this talk helps keep him out there as one of the big controversial talk - show hosts of our time			1
" that does n't mean , however , that @entity7 is done dodging bullets			2
in our passionate times , a person who rouses of any sort of emotion is bound to stay a target			0
( on monday , attorney @entity318 jumped into the fracas with an open letter calling @entity7 's apology " meaningless			1
" ) @entity322 was suspended after racially insensitive remarks in 2007			0
shock jock @entity324 had several run - ins while broadcasting in local @entity182 radio and in syndication			2
dr. @entity328 , the moralistic commentator and author , left broadcast radio in 2010 , telling @entity0 's @entity331 : " the reason is , i want to regain my first amendment rights			0
" @entity324 and @entity334 now ply their trades for the subscription - based satellite radio company @entity337			0
" anybody in talk radio who states a political opinion gets as many enemies as they get supporters , " @entity72 said			1
" being a celebrity today is dangerous , and being a controversial talk - show host is a very dangerous profession			1
" @entity0 's @entity346 contributed to this report .			0

@entity7 's words about student land him in hot water
