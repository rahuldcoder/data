-- it only took one message to convince @entity3			1
" the one that stuck in my head the most was the one about @entity8 -- all the people that gave their lives just so that we could vote			1
i 'm not a military person or nothing like that but they were right , and it makes sense , " said @entity3 , who is a sous - chef in @entity12 , @entity13			1
" that 's the main reason i 'm going to go try ( to vote on tuesday )			1
if i would n't have read that , i probably would n't " have decided to vote			1
the message came from a complete stranger , identified on @entity24 as @entity25 , as part of a @entity27 the list campaign to get people in @entity13 to vote in the upcoming election			1
the state had the lowest voter turnout rate in 2008 , making it the focus of several stories that are part of a new project , which i 'm heading up			1
the goal is to create a conversation that could help bump @entity13 off the bottom of that list			1
we featured six nonvoters from @entity13 as a way to highlight the diverse reasons people in the @entity13 do n't vote			1
because of your efforts , three of them decided to vote , two of those for the first time			2
a fourth plans to vote in the future , but did not register in time for tomorrow 's election ( that 's yet another reason @entity13 should pass a same - day voter registration law )			1
two say they wo n't vote in this election , but even they said that they were moved by the pro-voting arguments you sent , and that they may reconsider eventually			2
" i 've been reading them all			0
it 's amazing , " said @entity67 , who does not plan to vote on tuesday but seems to revel in the fact that she 's become a local celebrity of sorts in @entity71 because of this online campaign			1
" i love it , you know			0
i really take into consideration what people are saying			2
but , you know , i still have my reasons			0
" change the list : 47 of your pro-voting arguments personally , i think convincing three out of six is a great success			1
i chose these six nonvoters because i could n't figure out how to convince them to vote in person , on my visit to @entity13			1
their friends had n't been able to either			0
it shows the power of the @entity95 -- a medium that certainly goes a long way to shrink the thousands of miles of ocean between @entity13 and the mainland -- that your messages were able to persuade 50 % of the people we featured			1
incidentally , a 50 % turnout rate is exactly what @entity13 needs to hop off the bottom of the national voter turnout list , if the numbers hold from the 2008 presidential election			1
and how cool is it that one message from a stranger could convince another person to exercise his right to vote ? it reinforces my belief that if everyone asked several friends to vote in this upcoming election , turnout would be much higher and , more importantly , our democracy would be more representative of the people			1
there 's real power in an invitation into the political process , even if it 's via @entity24			2
here 's the tally of who plans to vote and who does n't			1
click the links below to read the messages that people sent to each of the nonvoters			1
thanks to all of you who sent in messages			2
know that they made a difference in how some people view voting			2
@entity144 : not voting , but plans to in the future @entity144 's wife , @entity147 , told me in an e-mail that her husband had not registered to vote for this election but now plans to do so in order to vote in 2014			1
@entity3 : voting the sous - chef on @entity13 's @entity155 did not plan to vote when i met him in october because he had such trouble at his polling place during the primary election this year			1
here is the text of the @entity24 message that convinced him to vote : " send him a free ticket to @entity167 and ( show ) him how many reasons there are to vote , since all those there died for that right , here and abroad			2
" " i thought that was a really powerful statement , " @entity3 said , " and it made really good sense			0
@entity67 : not voting @entity67 does n't vote because she believes the @entity175 illegitimately overthrew the @entity176 and has no right to rule the islands			2
she said she loved the messages encouraging her to vote -- some asked her to support candidates who value issues that are important to the @entity183 -- but that she 's not ready to vote in this election			1
" to tell you the truth , my mind is made up			0
i 'm going to stay the way i am , " she said			0
" i have my reasons			0
and voting is just not me			0
" her phone was ringing off the hook , she said , because of the project			2
people in @entity71 are talking about voting now , she said , and she expects that will make a difference at the polls			2
as for her : " for this election , " she said , " i 'm not ready			0
@entity200 : voting @entity200 , a high school senior , initially said he did n't feel informed enough to vote			2
but after reading messages from other young people who said they learned about the political process because they decided to vote , he came to see it as important			1
" i thought it was pretty legit , " he said of the project			2
" all my friends have been posting it on my @entity24			0
" he felt some peer pressure to vote , too			2
" i feel like i needed to vote because i 'm on the thing			0
i feel like i 'm obligated to vote			0
i feel good about it			0
i 'm going to be an adult anyway			0
i think it 's a right			0
@entity216 : not voting @entity216 appreciated your efforts -- " that was so cool			0
i thought a lot of those people had some really good ideas " -- but she does n't plan to vote			1
since @entity13 is so far from the mainland @entity175 , national politics simply do n't matter , she said			1
" i just do n't feel like my vote counts for a darn thing			0
i do n't think it will sway things one way or another , " she said			0
if the @entity231 were abolished , she said , then she might reconsider			0
@entity232 : voting @entity232 , a student at the @entity234 , said his parents did n't know he was n't planning to vote until they saw him featured on this website			0
his brother circulated the page of messages from people on the @entity95 , asking @entity232 to vote			1
the family pressure mounted from there			0
" i mean , they 're not like forcing me to vote			0
my parents are n't forcing me , but they said it 's a good thing and so i 'm going to vote			1
" he performed a sort of cost - benefit analysis about voting			0
once he looked into the process and realized he could vote by mail , it seemed so easy that there was no reason not to bother with it			0
" i do n't think my vote counts as much , but i am going to vote			0
it 's an opportunity that is n't really hard to do so i just figure , why not ? " the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity259 .			0
