" that is the most memorable @entity1 ever , to realize the impact of loss and yet cherish the gifts given by that very same devastation , " said @entity16 , who shared her story on @entity18			1
" i missed him that @entity1 and every day since , but count myself as oh so fortunate to have had such an amazing man in my life			1
" it 's easy to write off @entity1 as yet another meaningless @entity28 until you no longer have someone to send a card to			1

after he retired from the @entity64 , he went to college on the @entity66 and became the first person in his family to get a degree			2

@entity75 remembers when the family surprised her husband with the gift of a lifetime for @entity1			1
@entity80 was smitten with an antique classic @entity81 that he 'd spotted at their local music store in @entity83 , @entity84			2
@entity75 made a deal with the proprietor to make small payments on the $ 1,000 guitar with her sons so it would be theirs in time for @entity1 1996			1
when the son surpasses his father for weeks , she stopped in and paid installments for the guitar , along with and her sons , ages 7 , 8 and 9 , who pitched in part of their weekly allowances , @entity93 said in an @entity18			1
@entity101 , the store owner , was in on the plot too , she said			0
when her husband stopped by to see his coveted guitar , @entity101 shook his head and told him it had been sold			1
" that night was the hardest of all , when he came home and glumly remarked that it had sold , " she said			0

" when @entity1 arrived , they were up early as he slept in			1

" @entity131 's children imbue @entity1 with new meaning for him			1

@entity135 was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2001 and told he had six to 12 months to live , @entity131 said in an @entity18			0
he did n't want to try chemotherapy or radiation and decided to see what a raw , vegan diet would do for him			0
he ended up living for five more years , during which his relationship with his family changed dramatically , @entity131 said			2
my @entity1 wish : curious children " we always had a good relationship , but not super close where we shared intimate things or i would ask for his advice			1
that changed fairly quickly after his diagnosis , " he said			0
" it softened him a bit			0
" @entity131 said he also learned from the experience			0
it strengthened his faith and prompted some changes to his diet : less sugar and processed foods , more fruits , vegetables and whole grains , though his family is not vegan			2
from fat dad to ultra-fit father the importance of hard work and family has also taken on a new meaning , he said			2
" my dad left a legacy to me , my three siblings and our families that we should value our work or whatever we are doing			0
do n't just work hard ; do quality work			0
be able to look at what you 've done and be proud of it because you know you gave it your best effort , " he said			0
" he taught us also to always be there for each other			0
at the end of the day , you need to be able to count on family , and we were truly and still are very much a close family today			2
" for better or worse , sometimes it takes a near - death experience to remind us of life 's fragility			1
for @entity197 and her family , this @entity1 will be a time to celebrate how her husband saved her son 's life			1
her 6 - year - old son , @entity202 , was pushing his bike into the garage in april when somehow , the family 's suv lurched forward and pinned him underneath the front passenger tire			1
beneath him was his bike wheel , which was folded over " like a taco , " @entity208 said			1
" i started immediately screaming and praying at the same time , " said the fifth - grade teacher from @entity212 , @entity213 , who shared her story on @entity18			1
luckily , her husband , a police officer , had come home early from work			2
@entity208 was upstairs changing when he heard his wife scream and immediately ran downstairs in his underwear and bulletproof vest			1
he jumped in the car and backed it off his son			2
@entity202 had lost consciousness , and his skin had taken on an ashy , purple tone by the time his father knelt and started performing cpr			0
just when @entity208 thought it was over , her son started coughing up grassy - looking material			1
her son would later tell her that he remembers being asleep when he heard someone telling him to breathe			2
" i woke up , and it was my daddy , so i thought i better listen ! " he told his mother			0
an ambulance arrived and took him 30 minutes down the road to @entity240 , @entity241 , where he was treated for lacerations to his kidney and liver			0
miraculously , he was out of the hospital a week later and playing baseball a few weeks after that			0
bridging the intellectual divide with @entity249 he still has scars on his legs and belly , a small price to pay for a miracle , his mother said			0
now , the bond between father and son is stronger than ever			2
@entity208 credits her husband 's police training with saving her son 's life			1
had he still been a homebuilder , making much more money than he does now , he might not have known what to do			0
he joined the force after losing his job in the recession			0
" a lot of the time , ( police ) get a bad name , but you never hear about the good they do , " she said			2
" their training helps them help people on a daily basis , whether they 're in uniform or out of uniform			0
" @entity16 speaks of her father in heroic terms , too			0
like many veterans of his era , he seemed to harbor guilt for having survived @entity60 and @entity288			0
she once asked him whether he was a hero , and he told her no , because " only the cowards came home , " she said			0
before his death , she made arrangements for his burial in @entity295 , at the veterans cemetery , and made it to his hospital room in time to tell him that he 'd be in good company because " there are no cowards in @entity295 , as all @entity302 knows , " she said			2
this @entity1 , she 'll call her mother and brothers and toast her father 's memory with a @entity308 and @entity309 , his favorite drink			1
maybe she 'll remember when he walked her down the aisle at her wedding even though he could barely walk and pulled back her veil , kissed her cheek and told her to " be good			1
" " many of us ... are out of daddies at our houses			0
that does n't make @entity1 any less special ; in some ways , it means even more			1
i 'm so blessed to have the memories of the father i had , even if we do n't have him here anymore			0
