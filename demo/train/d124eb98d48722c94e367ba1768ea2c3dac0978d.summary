-- now that delegates have converged on @entity2 , @entity3 , for the @entity4 , one has to wonder whether there is enough room in the arena for all the conflicting and contradictory elements of the modern @entity9			1
there is the camp that claims it wants to be more inclusive , broader in its appeal and more welcoming to women , gays and minorities			2
former @entity3 gov. @entity17 recently warned that , because of changing demographics , the @entity9 has to " reach out to a much broader audience than we do today			1
" but then there is the camp that ensured that the @entity9 platform included language rejecting not just same - sex marriage but also the watered - down alternative that many elected officials find more palatable : civil unions			1
the @entity9 platform committee also defeated a proposed amendment that said all @entity31 should be treated " equally under the law " as long as they 're not hurting anyone else			1
@entity35 secretary of state @entity34 , who is known for his immigration hard - line , implied that it was fine to treat gays and lesbians differently because : " our government routinely judges situations where you might regard people completely affecting themselves like , for example , the use of controlled substances , like , for example , polygamy that is voluntarily entered into			0
we condemn those activities even though they are not hurting other people at least directly			0
" opinion : what the @entity9 needs to do in @entity2 there is the group that insists it wants to focus on economic issues as the best way to defeat president @entity57			1
many political observers see @entity60 's choice of spending hawk @entity61 as his running mate as pretty strong evidence that this view is prevailing at the top of the ticket			1
but then there is the group that ca n't seem to resist the catnip of social conservatism and that charges into the abortion debate			2
the platform also includes an across - the - board ban on all abortions , even in the case of rape or incest			0
and in 2012 , as in previous election years , even with all the supposed emphasis on the economy , being pro-choice was considered a liability for those vying for the @entity9 presidential nomination and a disqualifier for anyone chosen to be vice president			1
there is the camp that calls for states such as @entity91 to have the last say in shaping immigration policy by enlisting local police in the enforcement of federal immigration laws , denying driver 's licenses to illegal immigrants or attempting to punish landlords who rent to them			2
but there is also the camp that insists that states should n't have the final word with regard to immigration if it means they can grant drivers ' permits to illegal immigrants or opt out of a program such as @entity111 , which requires local police to submit to federal authorities the fingerprints of anyone they arrest to determine if they 're in the country illegally			0
there is the faction that still thinks you can keep out illegal immigrants from @entity122 and the rest of @entity124 by building walls and fences on the @entity31 - @entity122 border , but also the faction that wants to create new ways to bring in an ample supply of @entity132 immigrants to work legally in agriculture , hospitality , construction and other industries			0
there is the group that supports @entity60 's plan to encourage illegal immigrants to simply " self - deport " by making the country more unwelcoming and drying up employment opportunities , and the group that worries about a labor shortage and economic slowdown if that happens			1
opinion : @entity60 's ' birther ' remark is no joke the party platform expresses support for something that some employers want : a temporary guest worker program that imports foreign labor to offset worker shortages in fields such as agriculture			1
and it also backs something that many employers do n't : a requirement that all businesses participate in the government - administered e-verify system , which is supposed to determine whether an employee is legally eligible to work			0
this is some strange hash			0
what does it mean to be a @entity9 these days if unifying principles are so hard to come by ? a generous explanation could be that this is an example of the @entity9 " big tent " that some conservatives have always dreamed of , where @entity9 with different views can put aside their disagreements and come together in a common purpose			2
a more realistic explanation is that , in 2012 , the @entity9 has become a patchwork of individual interests united only by a shared desire to ensure that @entity57 is limited to a single term			1
we 'll have to see if that is enough to hold the coalition together			0
and if so , what it means for the future of the @entity189			0
what happens in @entity2 will be our first clue			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194			2

@entity194 : the deep divisions in the @entity9 are evident
he says some @entity9 emphasize social issues , such as *opposition* to gay marriage
others want to play down social issues , focus on the party 's economic message , he says
@entity194 : the only thing that unites @entity9 is a strong desire to defeat @entity57 's *re-election* bid
