@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 faces a @entity6 - style economic collapse if it keeps " spending a bunch of money we do n't have , " @entity1 gov. @entity3 said wednesday			1
@entity1 gov. @entity3 says he does not want to spend money that his state does n't have			1
@entity3 , a @entity12 , has been an outspoken critic of the @entity15 administration 's $ 800 billion stimulus plan			2
he said he 'll turn down about a quarter of his state 's $ 2.8 billion share unless @entity18 lets him use that money to pay down debt			1
" what you 're doing is buying into the notion that if we just print some more money that we do n't have and send it to different states , we 'll create jobs , " he said			1
" if that 's the case , why is n't @entity6 a rich place ? " @entity6 has been in the throes of an economic meltdown ever since the southern @entity33 nation embarked on a chaotic land reform program			0
its official inflation rate topped 11 million percent in 2008 , with its treasury printing banknotes in the trillion - dollar range to keep up with the plummeting value of its currency			1
but with @entity1 's unemployment rate now the second - highest in the country , state lawmakers will attempt to override @entity3 and take the $ 700 million if he turns it down , lt. gov. @entity41 said			1
" they will use the total economic stimulus to stimulate the economy , jump - start it , so we can get out of the ditch we are in as a state and as a nation , " @entity41 , a fellow @entity12 , said in a written statement wednesday			0
@entity54 figures released wednesday showed @entity1 's january unemployment rate hit 10.4 percent , second only to @entity56 's 11.6 percent			2
@entity3 is one of several @entity12 governors who have criticized the nearly $ 800 billion stimulus package , which passed with minimal @entity12 support in the @entity60 and none in the @entity62			0
other governors , such as @entity65 @entity12 @entity64 or @entity56 democrat @entity66 , have said they would take any money @entity12 - led states reject			0
but @entity3 told reporters that taking the money now would leave the state in the lurch in two years , " when those funds dry up			0
" " fundamentally , if you boil down what the stimulus means for @entity1 , it means we would go through the process of spending a bunch of money we do n't have , " he said			2
the stimulus measure allows state legislatures to override governors and take the money -- a provision championed by @entity1 congressman @entity87 , the no. 3 @entity66 in the @entity62			1
@entity87 said @entity3 is unlikely to get any waiver from the administration , and he called the governor 's announcement " 100 percent political posturing			2
" " this recovery package is designed to stabilize communities , to save and create jobs , and help our economy get back in a growth mode , " he told reporters			0
" and you do n't do that by paying down debt that 's been incurred over a long period of time			0
" and @entity41 said that if @entity1 turns down the money , " @entity1 taxpayers will be taking on the debt for economic stimulus money sent elsewhere			1
" @entity3 has been called a potential @entity12 presidential contender in 2012 , but he told @entity2 that the next election is " not where i 'm focused			0
" " i do n't rule anything in , i do n't rule anything out , " he said , adding , " if anything came along like that , it would be an incredibly long shot			0

@entity1 gov. @entity3 has *vowed* to refuse some of his state 's share
@entity3 casts stimulus as exercise in printing money that does n't exist to create jobs
the governor *compares* it to @entity6 's 11 million percent inflation rate
state legislatures can override governors and take stimulus money anyway
