-- the federal agency that protects the nation 's borders is doing a shoddy job protecting the nation 's wallet , abusing an overtime fund to the tune of $ 8.7 million annually , according to a government watchdog			1
the @entity11 @entity10 , an independent federal agency that receives whistleblower complaints , said offices within @entity14 and elsewhere within the @entity15 engage in a " gross waste of government funds			1
" overtime money intended for special circumstances was routinely given to employees who frequently spent that time watching sports and entertainment channels , special counsel @entity18 wrote in a letter to the @entity25			1
employees working in @entity14 's " @entity27 " received overtime 89 percent of the time , @entity18 said			1
" this case is not an isolated occurrence			2
rather , it is part of a persistent pattern of @entity34 [ administratively @entity35 ] allegations raised by @entity15 employees , " @entity18 wrote			1
the problem was brought to light , the @entity10 said , by several @entity14 employees who were authorized to receive the overtime pay but were troubled by the ethics of the practice and its impact on the federal budget			1
the @entity15 said in a statement that acting secretary @entity47 had requested a " comprehensive , department - wide review of the use of ( administrative overtime )			2
" " @entity15 takes seriously its responsibility to ensure proper use of taxpayer funds , " spokesman @entity52 said			1
@entity15 made a similar promise after allegations of overtime abuse surfaced in 2008 , the @entity56 said			2
in february of that year , a whistleblower alleged abuses at the @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity64			0
after a department report confirmed that employees abused overtime and that senior managers benefited from improperly approved overtime , the agency promised to implement " an @entity72 - wide @entity34 policy directive " to prevent misuse throughout the agency			2
" that commitment was made more than five years ago , " @entity18 wrote in her letter to the @entity25			0
" the lack of progress in implementing plans first outlined five years ago raises questions about the agency 's willingness or ability to confront this important problem			0
" the use of administrative overtime " functionally [ extended ] their daily shift by two hours each day , but are not the result of any unpredictable or compelling law enforcement need , " @entity18 wrote			0
@entity18 wrote that @entity15 must curb the abuse and , if warranted , revise the pay system to ensure fair pay for employees who are legitimately working overtime			1
the @entity10 said it is investigating whistleblower allegations of overtime abuse at five @entity15 locations : -- @entity14 's @entity99 in @entity100 , @entity101			1
-- @entity104 facility in @entity105			0
-- @entity14 's facility in @entity107 , @entity108			0
-- @entity14 's facility in @entity110 , @entity111			0
@entity113 chairman @entity112 said the revelations the overtime allowance is meant for agents who work unique hours " often in pursuit of drug smugglers " and other people " who pose a threat " to the nation			0
" this money was not meant to be a slush fund for officers or agents at desk jobs who work regular hours and who are clearly taking advantage of the system , " he said			0
" @entity131 will continue to investigate abuses such as this			0
