about 8.4 million people can rightfully call themselves @entity1 , according to 2013 census data			2
there are no official numbers to back this up , but it 'd be a pretty solid bet to say that an awful lot of them have never spent much time exploring the @entity11 beyond @entity12 , the @entity13 , the @entity14 and maaayyybe going out for a plate of manicotti and some tiramisu on @entity18			1
and that 's a friggin ' shame			2
not only is the @entity11 home to a hefty wedge of the @entity23 's residents -- around 1.4 million of them -- it 's also the birthplace and steward of some of @entity29 's greatest achievements in art and culture			1
hip - hop was born here			2
poetry , dance , sculpture and painting thrive			2
@entity38 architecture abounds and nature blooms			2
hop a northbound 2,4,5,6 , b or d train -- or a boat to @entity43 -- and slip into the rhythm of the boogie down @entity11			1
@entity46 the @entity11 gave birth to a beat all its own , and it 's generous enough to share this bounty with the rest of the world			1
the @entity46 preserves the history and celebrates the future of jazz , salsa , r&b , hip - hop and all other forms of music with roots in the borough			1
the center hosts live performances , readings , screenings , art programs and installations , and music history trolley tours of the neighborhood			0
and if you 're in a specifically hip - hop state of mind , hop a bus tour of classic battle sites , historic clubs and famous music video locations			0
hush tours are helmed by emcees , graffiti artists and djs like @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and others			0
the @entity89 there 's a saying that " only the dead know @entity92			0
" that may be true of the @entity11 too			1
in the borough 's @entity89 , the collective knowledge of permanent residents makes up some of the best of @entity29 culture			1
commune with the spirits of @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , madam @entity111 and other borough luminaries in a 400 - acre outdoor museum where lot owners are encouraged to celebrate			2
@entity116 in the midst of @entity1 's concrete jungle lies an oasis of serenity in the form of 28 meticulously tended acres of gardens , greenhouses , walks and trails and a cultural center geared toward getting city residents in touch with the natural world around them			1
organized gatherings are n't allowed on the @entity116 premises , but the public is welcome to pack lunches , stroll through the grounds and attend talks , lectures and concerts			1
while there is generally an entrance fee , @entity138 sponsors free hours on tuesday and saturday mornings year - round			0
@entity141 this truly grand stretch of boulevard is the @entity11 's answer to @entity146 ' @entity145 -- but in true @entity1 style , stretches even longer and wider			1
the mostly @entity38 - lined thoroughfare runs from @entity149 to @entity150 and showcases some of the finest architectural facades and structures in all the five boroughs			0
the historic district designated by the @entity155 is between 153rd and 167th streets , easily accessible from the subway ( try the @entity158 , @entity159 , 4 to 161st @entity160 ) , and should by all rights include a stop in @entity163 , named for the soldier and writer best known for the poem " trees			0
" @entity168 this museum has a mission : making the arts accessible to everyone , regardless of income level			0
on its 40th anniversary in 2011 , the museum instituted a free admission policy , allowing the entire community -- especially schoolchildren , artists and families -- to experience its permanent collection and special exhibitions of prints , painting , installations , photographs , sculpture , films , poetry and movement			0
curators pay special attention to giving visibility to artists of @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity198 - @entity29 descent , and those with direct ties to the @entity11			1
@entity43 while the rest of the borough is the only part of @entity1 contiguous with the mainland , the @entity11 's @entity43 is surrounded by @entity206 and @entity207 and stands as a living monument to @entity1 's nautical history			1
the island is accessible by drawbridge ( city bus @entity212 will take you straight over it ) and boasts some of the best seafood restaurants -- and boating and fishing opportunities -- the city has to offer			0
if it looks somehow familiar , that may be because it 's served as the backdrop for plenty of films including " @entity226 , " " @entity227 , " " @entity228 " and the eponymous " @entity43			0
" @entity229 and @entity89 when people think @entity11 eats , it 's usually @entity18 pasta and @entity12 hot dogs that come to mind			1
those are all well and good , but the borough is filled with ethnic enclaves of people who like to feast as well			2
@entity237 to @entity229 for heady @entity195 and @entity239 flavors and @entity89 for hearty @entity241 fare			1
and for those worried about where to pop in for a pint or a roti , @entity243 tour guides can help visitors balance out their caloric intake with a little legwork in between bites			0
@entity252 street art does n't usually get a co-sign from building owners , but in 2012 , @entity256 started the @entity257 to get landlords to team up with graffiti artists to create one - of - a - kind -- and totally legal -- paintings on their public walls			0
@entity257 has been endorsed by @entity263 on the @entity252 and has a stated mission of " enhancing the visual landscape of urban communities with art. " @entity268 offers a bus - driven exploration through the borough - wide outdoor gallery			2
@entity273 before his mysterious 1849 death in @entity275 , @entity273 spent his twilight years in a cottage at @entity277 and the @entity141			0
he wrote some of his best - known works there , including " @entity281 , " " @entity282 " and " @entity283			0
" @entity273 and his wife @entity285 moved to the @entity11 in the hope that the country air ( why yes -- country air in the @entity11 ) would soothe the ravages wrought upon her by tuberculosis , but she succumbed nonetheless			1
the cottage has been fully restored to its period appearance by the @entity294 and is open to the public on the weekends and groups ( by appointment ) throughout the week .			0

go beyond @entity12 and the *zoo* to explore the best of the @entity11
@entity116 is an oasis of serenity in this densely populated borough
@entity237 to @entity229 for heady @entity195 and @entity239 flavors
