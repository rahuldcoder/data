-- internet shoppers could be one step closer to having to pay sales taxes on online purchases			1
in a vote on monday , the @entity5 passed the @entity7 , which will require all online retailers to collect sales taxes for the states where they ship goods			1
the legislation still needs to pass the @entity15 - controlled @entity14 before it can become a law			2
@entity14 spokesman @entity17 has said that president @entity18 supports the bill			0
why is there no online sales tax now ? until now , online shoppers have enjoyed buying items from e-commerce sites mostly sales - tax free			1
that 's because older laws require stores to collect sales tax only on goods shipped to states where they have a physical presence , such as a distribution center or a physical store			1
the primary reason for not requiring sales taxes for products sold across state lines is that it was just too complicated			2
having to juggle the various sales tax laws and amounts for all 45 states that have sales tax was seen as a burden on businesses			1
states that collect sales tax often have different rates depending on the type of goods being sold			1
alcohol might have a higher sales tax rate while some goods like groceries dental equipment can be tax free			2
within a state , cities and counties can charge additional taxes			0
what 's changed ? the most recent @entity62 ruling that addressed the issue was in 1992 , when internet commerce was non-existent and computer software not as advanced			0
advocates for the online sales tax argue that current technology makes it possible to simplify and automate the task of collecting sales taxes for various states			1
under the @entity7 , state governments that want to collect the tax will have to provide companies with free software for calculating taxes and set up one state entity to receive the payment			0
wait , are n't we required to pay sales tax already ? in most states with sales taxes , people who buy goods online ( or over the phone or through the mail ) from another state are subject to a @entity89			1
they are supposed to keep track of everything they purchase and pay sales taxes when they file their tax return			1
many consumers either ignore or are not aware of these requirements , and states say it is difficult to enforce			0
because people are already technically required to pay for unpaid sales tax , proponents of the bill argue that it is n't a new tax at all but a more efficient way of enforcing existing tax laws			1
who wants this tax ? the bill 's supporters include big box retailers like @entity111 , the @entity112 , e-commerce powerhouse @entity113 , small brick and mortar business , a mix of @entity15 and @entity118 and president @entity18			0
proponents say it will level the playing field for online and physical stores			0
large retailers like @entity111 have physical stores in most states and are already required to collect sales taxes for online sales			1
they argue that online - only retailers have an unfair advantage			0
until recently , @entity113 was firmly against the online sales tax			1
but as the retailer has grown it 's become interested in expanding its physical operations into more states , paving the way for faster and same - day delivery of goods			0
now the company is a big supporter of the law , which will help it stay competitive against other online - only retailers as it moves into more states			2
who 's against it ? online marketplace @entity143 is leading the charge against the tax , which could impact its many sellers who do more than $ 1 million in out - of - state business annually			0
in a letter to @entity143 sellers , ceo @entity149 suggested the law should exempt any business with fewer than 50 employees or that make less than $ 10 million a year on out - of - state sales			0
conservatives and anti-tax activists are also against the law and claim it will hurt online businesses			0
smaller businesses that make more than the $ 1 million threshold claim it could still be costly to integrate a new accounting system , even with the proposed simplifications			0
how much money will this bring in ? there were $ 225.5 billion in online sales in 2012 , according to the @entity168 @entity167			2
states lost out on a combined $ 23 billion in uncollected sales tax revenue , according to estimates from the @entity172			2
what about states with no sales tax ? five states currently have no statewide sales tax : @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182			2
people who live in a state without sales tax wo n't be charged on goods they have shipped to their home state			2
however , businesses based in these states will have to collect sales taxes for items shipped to other places where there are sales taxes			1
how much will i pay ? people in states that do have sales tax will pay the same amount of sales tax as you would buying an item in person at a local store			1
sales tax rates are complicated and vary according to the type of product			2
to find out how much something will cost under this new law , choose a location and tax category on @entity213 's interactive map			0
it will be possible to avoid sales taxes by buying from small out - of - state retailers making less than $ 1 million a year and not reporting use taxes when you file taxes			1
when will it go into effect ? you do n't need to start stockpiling goods from your favorite online stores just yet			0
there are still a few hurdles before states can start collecting sales tax on online purchases			1
the earliest it could go into effect is october 1 , 2013			0
after the vote on monday , the bill will have to pass the @entity14 where it could face more resistance that it did in the @entity5			1
if it does become a law , individual states will still have to meet some requirements before they can compel companies to pay state sales tax			1
they must simplify their tax processes and creating a single entity for collecting state taxes			0
twenty two states have already begun the process as part of the @entity249 , which is a move by states to simplify their tax laws and regulations .			0

the @entity5 on monday *approved* an online sales tax
currently online retailers do not have to collect sales taxes outside of the states where they are based
@entity263 would still need to pass the @entity14 before it could become law
online shoppers would have to pay the same sales tax as when buying the item at a store
