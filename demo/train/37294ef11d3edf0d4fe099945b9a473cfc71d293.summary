@entity0 -- there is little evidence the @entity6 government 's sweeping collection of phone records , as revealed by admitted intelligence leaker @entity8 , has helped prevent terror attacks as national security officials have claimed , a top senator said on wednesday			1
@entity13 chairman @entity12 opened a hearing on the controversial @entity15 ( @entity15 ) program applied under post 9/11 anti-terror legislation and approved by a secret court by questioning if it works or is needed			1
" if this program is not effective , it has to end , " the @entity21 @entity20 said of the phone record collection program under @entity23 of the @entity24			0
he noted that classified details provided by the @entity15 on how the initiative had been used do not " reflect dozens or even several terrorist plots " that it helped prevent " let alone 54 as some have suggested			1
" despite @entity12 's complaint , @entity15 director gen. @entity32 later wednesday repeated the figure of 54 terrorist events thwarted by the overall surveillance effort , of which the @entity23 program is one component			1
" if we tell everyone exactly what we 're doing , then the adversaries will know exactly how to get through our defenses , " he told a conference in warning of the danger caused by @entity8 's leaks			0
published reports have indicated the @entity15 received secret court approval to collect vast amounts of so - called metadata from telecommunications giant @entity52 and leading internet companies , including @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58			2
@entity15 chief : snooping is crucial to fighting terrorism this includes " non-content " material -- phone numbers called , or e-mail addresses -- rather than the actual substance of the information , which would require a separate search warrant			2
@entity71 chairman @entity70 said her panel was looking at potential changes to the surveillance programs , including a reduction in the five - year limit that the @entity15 currently can can hold gathered records			1
@entity70 , a @entity78 @entity20 , said the @entity13 also was considering a requirement for the @entity15 to expedite its review of information it collects under the section 215 program and another one that gathers internet use information from abroad			1
" these are things that can be done to increase transparency , but not to stop the program , " she said			0
" i believe , based on what i have seen and i read intelligence regularly , that we would place this nation in jeopardy if we eliminated these two programs			0
" meanwhile , the @entity95 in @entity96 published a report on an @entity15 program that it says mines @entity99 browsing history and other online data , some of it in real time			2
the program called @entity107 , which does not require any type of formal authorization , was detailed in documents leaked to the newspaper by @entity8 , the @entity95 said wednesday			2
@entity8 's revelations have triggered new debate about national security and privacy interests , and about the secretive legal process that sets in motion surveillance			1
with lawmakers sharpening scrutiny of how the law is applied and the @entity123 narrowly defeating an amendment to cut surveillance funding last week , the @entity119 administration is scrambling to demonstrate more transparency and regain congressional support			0
earlier this month , it declassified and publicized the @entity15 program 's periodic renewal			2
on wednesday , director of national intelligence @entity131 released other previously secret documents , including reports from the 2009 to 2011 period			1
report : @entity137 wanted to fly @entity8 's father to @entity139 the @entity141 reports were aimed at helping @entity142 understand the surveillance as lawmakers debated renewing relevant parts of the @entity24			2
" the @entity15 's bulk collection programs provide important tools in the fight against terrorism , especially in identifying terrorist plots against the homeland , " the 2011 report said			1
" these tools are also unique in that they can produce intelligence not otherwise available to @entity15			2
" @entity8 's father : my son loves his country at wednesday 's hearing , @entity141 and security officials conceded the lack of direct causal links between the section 215 phone record collection and thwarted attacks , but said the program was part of a crucial network for filling information gaps			1
opinion : we need transparency on domestic surveillance they said the network of surveillance programs over the years helped thwart dozens of plots , including those targeting the stock exchange and the subway system in @entity179			1
in another apparent bid to demonstrate transparency , the @entity119 administration now says terror defendants should be informed when the government plans to use as evidence any information from its secret collection of electronic records			0
the change in legal interpretation this week suggests that criminal defendants subject to certain types of surveillance may be able to challenge the constitutionality of the @entity15 programs			1
as recently as this spring , the administration had argued that such disclosure of information from a secret court order was not necessary , even if the information was used to track and capture a suspect			0
the @entity200 in its last term limited lawsuits against the government by plaintiffs who were unable to prove they were specific subjects of surveillance			0
those plaintiffs had complained of a " @entity206 " because the government refused to acknowledge any surveillance for national security reasons			0
it was not clear if other pending terror prosecutions involving metadata evidence would adopt the new legal interpretation			0
@entity214 : @entity15 chief to hackers : if you do n't like what we do , change it but the latest efforts in transparency were clouded by the @entity95 report on @entity107 , which it said magnified statements by @entity8 that he , as a contractor , could easily access an astonishingly broad menu of personal information on just about anyone			1
security officials had called @entity8 's assertion untrue , and @entity123 spokesman @entity230 echoed that denial on wednesday by saying allegations of " widespread , unchecked analyst access to @entity15 collection data are false			1
" separately , the @entity15 said in a statement that its tools include stringent checks to limit what an analyst can do			2
" not every analyst can perform every function and no analyst can operate freely , " the statement said			0
at the @entity13 committee hearing , @entity12 asked @entity15 deputy director @entity244 whether the agency has held anyone responsible for the @entity8 leaks			1
" how soon will we know who screwed up ? " @entity12 asked , contending that inadequate controls allowed the former @entity15 contractor to leak surveillance program documents to media outlets			1
" i think that we 'll know over weeks and months precisely what happened and who should then be hold accountable -- and we will hold them accountable , " @entity244 responded			0
@entity123 rejects effort to curb @entity15 phone surveillance @entity12 was impatient with the answer and raised the issue in connection with former army intelligence analyst @entity262 , who was convicted on tuesday of leaking a trove of iraq war battlefield reports , diplomatic cables and other information			1
" we had a huge security breach , i think we 'll all agree , committed by @entity8			0
and a few years ago @entity262 downloaded hundreds of thousands of classified and sensitive documents -- passed them on to @entity270 , " @entity12 said			0
" now , if two data breaches of this magnitude occurred in the private sector , somebody would have been held accountable by now			0
" @entity8 has fled the country and remains in diplomatic limbo at the @entity139 airport			0
the @entity6 has charged him with espionage			0
opinion : @entity15 secrets kill our trust @entity1 's @entity283 contributed to this report .			0
