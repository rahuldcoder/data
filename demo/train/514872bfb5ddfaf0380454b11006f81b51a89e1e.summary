-- if " can i kick it ? " provokes an almost involuntary " yes , you can ! " and " you 're on point , @entity5 " brings " all the time , tip , " then you 're in the right place			1
if your idea of hip - hop is confined to @entity10 , @entity11 or @entity12 , then you 'll also benefit from spending a little time with @entity6 , @entity5 , @entity14 and @entity15 , aka @entity16			1
in " @entity17 : the @entity25 , " actor @entity18 tries out his directorial chops by attempting to document the rise , fall , rise ( again ) and fall ( again ) of the seminal @entity23 hip - hop group , achieving mixed results			1
although the film is chock - a - block with great music and interesting characters , it lacks a coherent focus and seems to want to be all films to all people			2
a mixture of footage shot for this film and that from other sources , the documentary jumps back and forth between the band 's early days , their first split in 1998 and their reunion ( and subsequent second break - up ) in 2008 on the @entity43 tour			1
it gives a reasonably detailed and personal look into what made the band tick as well as what made them stop			0
unfortunately , it does n't work as a whole			0
great documentaries most often latch on to the universality of their subject and connect on an emotional or intellectual level with their audience			0
they can be about an obscure , unattractive animal ( naked mole rats , anyone ? ) , a troubled child in a small town ( " @entity69 " ) or a wacky modern - day philosopher king / tour guide ( " @entity70 " ) , but they have a purpose , a point of view and a connection with the audience			0
" @entity17 , " while loaded with great material , lacks that connection			0
clearly charismatic and talented men , the four members of @entity16 ( @entity15 left the group for a significant stretch during its heyday but rejoined them for occasional reunion tours ) have a lot to say about how they met , how they worked together and how they broke up , but the film never really pieces this together in any sort of narrative that can be closely followed			2
@entity5 's health problems ( he is a type - 1 diabetic who undergoes a kidney transplant during the film ) are mentioned , but only @entity15 , ironically the least - involved member of the group , shows any real emotions about his friend 's dire health condition			1
in the film 's only other real showing of emotion , we learn that @entity5 's wife is a match , and she donates one of her kidneys			1
for @entity23 or hip - hop fans ( of which this critic is both ) , the film offers frequent bits of interest , humor and musical delight and is certainly a pleasant way to spend 98 minutes			1
@entity5 is especially loquacious , waxing rhapsodic on subjects as diverse as his eating habits ( he lists @entity113 as one of the snack foods he 's had to give up ) and basketball			2
in the latter , he 's seen wearing an @entity119 uniform , and @entity6 questions him about his allegiance to his hometown @entity121 and their new star , @entity122			0
@entity5 replies , rapid - fire , without missing a beat , that he loves the @entity121 , but their front office is a mess and " i like @entity122 , but i 'm gon na need him to play some defense			2
" however , while the members of @entity16 are all talented and charismatic artists with interesting and compelling stories to tell , " @entity17 " does n't tell them fully			0
it 's a complex story involving music , family , history and the greater world of @entity23 hip - hop ( which is in and of itself worth of a film ) , and what it comes down to is that @entity140 had so many directions to choose , so much footage to watch , that the film suffers from the overload			1
perhaps choosing a subject that is a little less close to his heart will afford @entity18 the distance that is sometimes needed to make a compelling documentary .			0

for hip - hop fans , the film offers frequent bits of interest , humor and musical delight
@entity5 is a type - 1 diabetic who undergoes a kidney transplant during the film
@entity18 has moderate *success* documenting the group 's rises and falls
