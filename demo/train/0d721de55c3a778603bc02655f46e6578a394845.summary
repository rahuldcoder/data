@entity0 -- the @entity3 @entity2 has re-ignited the so - called gender war that shone so brightly after the country 's prime minister 's blistering attack on sexism and misogyny in parliament earlier this month			1
@entity12 's tirade , which drew global attention , and at the time of writing had been viewed almost two million times on @entity17 , was directed at the opposition leader , @entity18			1
" the leader of the opposition says that people who hold sexist views and who are misogynists are not appropriate for high office			2
well , i hope the leader of the opposition has got a piece of paper and he is writing out his resignation , " @entity12 blared			2
@entity18 's @entity29 took deep offense			0
had the prime minister conflated or confused " sexism " and " misogyny , " or worse , deliberately distorted the meaning of misogyny to score a resounding political point ? was @entity12 seriously asserting that her opposite number held a pathological hatred of women , as most dictionaries define misogyny ? for the @entity29 , it seemed a bit rich that the prime minister saw misogyny in @entity18 but not in one of her own supporters , the former speaker of the house who resigned in disgrace following sms texts widely viewed as meeting the dictionary definition of misogyny			1
into the fray weighed @entity3 's leading dictionary			1
editor @entity52 surprised the nation wednesday by declaring @entity2 would alter its definition of misogyny , closer to the conflated version used by the prime minister			1
in its next published edition , the dictionary 's editors said the word would be defined as both the " hatred of women " and " entrenched prejudice against women			1
" @entity52 said @entity2 had decided that for the past 20 or 30 years , " misogyny " had taken on wider meaning , particularly in feminist discourse and that with changed usage should come a changed definition			1
" you 're not really saying they [ misogynists ] have a pathological sickness , that they should be on a psychiatrist 's couch discussing their early relations with their mother or anything like that , " she told the @entity69 ( @entity69 )			0
" they merely have what we think of as sexism , an entrenched prejudice against women , " she added			1
and so , @entity85 , who said she sees herself as the " person with the mop and the broom and the bucket who 's cleaning up the language after the party 's over , " decided that after this " fairly big party , " the word misogyny needed mopping			1
@entity18 has refused to buy into the debate , dismissing the issue as the latest outbreak of the " politics of smear			0
" but the decision has divided @entity3			0
as " @entity106 , " a reader of the @entity69 website , put it : " this is just ludicrous ! a prominent figure misuses a word -- and gets embarrassingly caught out for doing so by anyone who understands the @entity111 language or who can read a dictionary -- and so the @entity114 decides to redefine the word to match the prominent person 's intended meaning			0
... is the @entity2 also going to redefine ' misandry ' , or is it only accusatory and inflammatory words used by women against men that need to have their definition broadened to save embarrassment ? " for the record , @entity2 has said that it 's also considering redefining " misandry , " which it says currently covers " entrenched prejudice rather than hatred			1
" even for those who applauded @entity12 's speech , the dictionary 's move seemed odd and unhelpful			1
comedian and columnist @entity135 said the debate over dictionary definitions was " reductive and pointless			0
" she said she thought questioning the prime minister 's use of the word misogyny detracted from what she said was @entity12 's triumph -- calling out sexism -- and diminished the speech to a whine			1
" ... if the only way to have any kind of debate about gender in this country is to play the dictionary card , we ask @entity2 to change the definition of complaining to ' women defending their right to take part in public and private life without being ridiculed , negated or abused on the basis of their gender			2
' " @entity162 found an army of supporters			0
one of them wrote : " it is obvious that many males and alas females ca n't accept the idea that the behavior the prime minister called out is misogynistic			2
much easier for their conscience that the word be attacked as the wrong word than face the truth of the situation			0
" one female who believes the new definition of misogyny is silly is prominent @entity181 columnist @entity180 who wrote : " he ( @entity18 ) is now just to be officially accused of exhibiting entrenched prejudice rather than having a " visceral hatred '' of half the world 's population			1
it must be like the 2012 version of a mortal as opposed to a venal sin			0
guilty as charged , apparently , " she wrote			0
@entity180 continued : " what is even more astonishing though is how so much of the feverish argument has seamlessly managed to equate @entity12 's attack on @entity18 into a general and principled assault on the evils of sexism or misogyny , however defined			2
" the thing about fevers is that they can be catchy			0
following the @entity2 decision , the @entity204 dictionary @entity202 has said it is closely following developments in @entity3			2
@entity202 associate editor @entity207 told the @entity3 newspaper ( itself , experiencing fever at the change of definition ) : " a quick review of our citational evidence shows that ' misogyny ' has been used to refer to a very broad range of behaviors , attitudes , policies , and so on ...			2
no dictionary definition is set in stone			0
we will continue to gather evidence of the word ' misogyny ' in use , and compare our definition against that use			0
" watch out @entity227 , who like @entity18 , is trying to mend his image with female voters , after his statement in the second @entity231 that he 'd been brought " whole binders full of women " by women 's groups after he issued a plea for qualified women to work in his @entity237 government .			0

@entity3 's @entity2 redefines the word ' misogyny '
follows debate over its true meaning after prime minister 's speech to parliament
@entity12 accused the opposition leader of being sexist and a misogynist
@entity2 has amended its definition to *include* " entrenched prejudice against women "
