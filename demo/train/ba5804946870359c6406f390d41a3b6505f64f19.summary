-- @entity1 by @entity2 @entity3 has @entity4 to thank for introducing him to this satirical novel about @entity6 , which @entity2 wrote in secret from 1928 until just before his death in 1940 , and which was finally published 26 years later			1
" i was reading @entity9 ¨ res 's trilogy on @entity12 and this book came up as something i might like , so i bought it , " says @entity3			1
" it 's now my favorite novel -- it 's just the greatest explosion of imagination , craziness , satire , humor , and heart			1
" the fantastical work so captured @entity3 that for his 21st birthday , he traveled to @entity6 to visit the author 's apartment in @entity28			1
" there are passages that have become everyday @entity32 sayings			0
for instance , ' manuscripts do n't burn			0
' if it had ever come out that this book was being written , @entity2 would likely have disappeared permanently			0
that phrase stands for the fact that nothing is more powerful or more indestructible than the written word			0
" @entity0 : see @entity42 's fall reading list @entity43 in @entity44 by @entity45 " this is one of the funniest books i 've ever read , which is the main reason i recommend it to people , " says @entity3 , who was given @entity45 's drug - fueled , madcap rumination on @entity49 culture in the 1960s as a 15th birthday present by a friend on the @entity54 set			1
" but there is a sadness in it as well			0
i think @entity45 loved @entity12 despite himself , and this is a lament for the passing of a time that we 'll never see again			0
he was such an intelligent and socially aware person ; he knew even when he wrote this in 1971 that a decade like the ' 60s could not happen again			0
and it is kind of sad to read it now because i know i will never have the feeling of living in a time that fresh and with so few boundaries			1
" @entity0 : the latest award winners : how many have you read ? @entity75 by @entity76 this hefty masterpiece about the plight of @entity84 miners in the 1860s " made me realize that when books are considered ' classics , ' most of the time they 're actually very readable and exciting , " @entity3 says			1
" it amazes me how deftly @entity76 captures the idiosyncrasy , the mundanity , and the scale of life among all these different classes of people			0
every character feels fully formed and real			0
and once i learned more about @entity76 's involvement in the @entity94 " -- the infamous turn - of - the - century case in which @entity76 , citing anti-semitism , publicly accused the @entity84 army of wrongfully convicting a @entity100 captain of treason -- " and how he advocated for individual freedom , i just thought , i love this man			1
he must have been an incredible person to know			0
" @entity0 : how @entity105 gets inspired labyrinths by @entity107 this collection of short stories by a master of magical realism " blew my mind , " says @entity3			1
" when i read a good book , i sometimes like to think i might be capable of writing something similar , but never , in my wildest dreams , could i write anything that approaches the level of cleverness and intellect and madness of @entity107			1
i do n't think anyone could			0
" his favorite ? the @entity125 writer 's short story " @entity126 " ( " @entity107 proves that if you can write a story in ten pages , it does n't need to be any longer " ) , in which he imagines an infinite library filled with every book written , not yet written , and every combination of words and letters in between			2
" the premise is that contained somewhere in these books is the meaning of life			2
so cults develop that walk through the library searching for it			0
the fact that @entity107 could start with such an idea -- an infinite library , what would that involve ? -- and then take it to a logical conclusion is remarkable			0
" @entity0 : books that made a difference to @entity152 midnight 's children by @entity154 " i read this on vacation in @entity165 when i was 15 , " says @entity3 , who credits the @entity156 band the @entity157 with getting him hooked on @entity154 's allegorical novel about the independence and partition of @entity161 and its aftermath			1
" they have a song called ' @entity168 , ' which is , essentially , a list of famous authors			1
i made it my mission after hearing it to read one book by every author on the list , which starts with @entity176 and ends with @entity154			1
" @entity3 says people scoffed when he picked up the novel , thinking he was too young to grasp it			1
" i still have no idea why			0
it is the most enchanting book			0
and it 's such a brilliant idea : children born at the same hour who metaphorically encompass all the good and evil attributes of a new society			2
@entity154 writes with a true patriotism -- a love for his country that 's not blind			2
" @entity191 by @entity192 @entity192 's last major work of fiction , the epic tale of a luckless fisherman and his exhausting struggle to reel in a giant marlin , " is just a beautiful story , simply told , " @entity3 says			1
" i have friends who never read books , and so when they ask me what they should pick up first , i always give them this one			1
i tell them there are some books that are like drugs , and will give you a quick hit , but if you want something that will stay with you and resonate for a long while afterward , then try this			2
i read it for school , and it speaks to the power of the book that i could analyze the bugger out of it and still not fall out of love with it			2
