-- @entity1 is coming under growing pressure from some of @entity5 's leading football federations to take " urgent action " and restore confidence in the world governing body			1
under - fire @entity1 has faced heavy criticism over its refusal to publish a key report into allegations of corruption surrounding the @entity16 bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments in @entity18 and @entity19			2
@entity21 's 2018 bid was singled out for particular criticism by @entity24 judge @entity23 when he delivered his 42 - page summary of @entity27 's report last week			2
but the @entity29 chairman @entity28 has hit back , confirming he will be writing to every member of the @entity1 executive committee asking for full publication			1
" i am writing to each member of the @entity34 on behalf of the @entity29 to urge you to insist on the publication of mr @entity27 's full report as a matter of some urgency			1
" as you probably know the reputation of @entity1 was already low in @entity21 and much of @entity5 before the events of last week			2
" @entity1 had hoped @entity23 's summary would draw a veil over the bidding process , but that hope was scuppered when @entity47 lawyer @entity27 said the 42 - page report was error ridden			1
" the failure to publish mr @entity27 's report and his statement that the summary report which was published contained " numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations " has resulted in a further decline in public confidence of @entity1 , " added @entity28			1
" we can not go on like this			0
complete transparency is required if the actions of all those who bid , including @entity21 2018 , are to be judged fairly			0
" @entity28 went on to ask members of the @entity1 executive committee to think of the greater good for @entity1 and football			1
" i know some of you believe that @entity1 's reputation in @entity21 is the result of an obsession amongst the @entity72 media with @entity1 and i know mr @entity66 sees their reports as an unfair attack on the organization he leads , " said @entity66			1
" however , in @entity21 we see it differently			0
if you read a whole range of @entity72 newspaper reports about @entity1 , particularly those in the @entity85 , they do provide compelling evidence of wrong doing			2
" they can not be simply dismissed as " racist " or " an attack on @entity1 " as mr @entity66 described them at the @entity91 in @entity92			2
" urgent action is needed if confidence in @entity1 is to be rebuilt in @entity21			1
the @entity29 is of the view that this action should start with the full publication of mr @entity27 's report			1
" @entity28 's move comes after the @entity21 's 2018 bid team was accused of acting improperly during the bidding process by the report			1
the @entity29 was accused accused of attempting to " curry favor " with former @entity1 vice-president @entity103 , who left his role in 2011 following allegations of bribery			1
the report claims that the @entity21 bidding team sponsored a $ 55,000 gala dinner for the @entity110 , allowed the @entity112 under - 20 squad to hold a training camp in the @entity114 in 2009 and attempted to help a " person of interest " to @entity103 find a job in the country			0
a spokesman for the @entity29 refuted the claims in a statement on the organization 's website			1
" we note the @entity124 has today published a 42 - page report in relation to the bidding processes for the @entity128 in 2018 and 2022			0
" we were not given any prior notice of the report before publication			0
we do not accept any criticism regarding the integrity of @entity21 's bid or any of the individuals involved			2
" we conducted a transparent bid and , as the report demonstrates with its reference to the @entity21 bid team 's ' full and valuable cooperation ' , willingly complied with the investigation			0
we maintain that transparency and cooperation around this entire process from all involved is crucial to its credibility			0
" we also note that after a lengthy investigatory process and assessment , the report has concluded that the ' potentially problematic facts and circumstances identified by the report regarding the @entity21 2018 bid were , all in all , not suited to compromise the integrity of the @entity16 2018/22 bidding process as a whole '			0
" @entity157 , who was part of the @entity21 2018 bid , told @entity0 last week that the report was a " politically motivated whitewash "			0
" even before it was published , i had no confidence in the report , " he said			0
" now @entity27 has come out and told us there are inaccuracies why should anyone believe anything ? " mr @entity27 had limited powers and could n't investigate everybody he wanted to			0
" he did n't speak to a number of members form the executive committee			0
