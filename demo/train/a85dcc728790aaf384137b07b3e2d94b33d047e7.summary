as investigators search for clues to what happened to @entity5 , the answer to one question may prove key : why did the transponder in the @entity8 stop transmitting information ? the fact that it happened at all is astonishing to @entity11 , a broadcast aviation analyst and veteran pilot			1
" it is hard to conceive of a situation in which a triple seven would lose all ability to have its transponder on and the crew would not find some way to communicate , " he told @entity15			1
a senior @entity24 air force official said tuesday that the plane traveled hundreds of miles in the opposite direction from its original destination , and had stopped sending identifying transponder codes before it disappeared from radar screens			1
suggestions that the plane veered off course and that its transponder was not working raise questions about a hijacking , but a catastrophic power failure or other problem might also explain the anomalies , analysts said			1
here are some of the options : turned off intentionally @entity42 , a longtime pilot , said tuesday it was not clear whether the transponder was turned off intentionally			1
a power failure would have turned off the main transponder and its backup , and the plane could have flown for more than an hour with such a power failure , the president of @entity46 told @entity15 's @entity52			1
but @entity53 expressed doubt that that could have been the case			1
the electrical system aboard the plane is so robust and the transponder draws so little power that it would be one of the last pieces of equipment to go dark , even after a catastrophic event like an engine explosion or a breach of the cabin and rapid decompression , he said			1
" i 'm in a head - scratching mode , " @entity53 said			1
" the most likely probability is that a human hand turned that off			1
then you get into the logic tree of who and why and there are n't that many channels in that tree			2
" he added , " this is beginning to look very , very much like a hijacking			1
" a former @entity82 safety inspector agreed			1
@entity83 , author of " @entity84 , " cited the redundant electrical , charging , battery and communications systems on @entity88			2
much had to go wrong for the aircraft to lose its transponder and then to veer off course , he said , adding that it stands to reason " that someone forced those pilots to take control of the aircraft and take it off course			2
" turning off a transponder requires a deliberative process , said @entity98 , former managing director of the @entity99			1
" if someone did that in the cockpit , they were doing it to disguise the route of the plane , " he told @entity15			2
" there might still be mechanical explanations on what was going on , but those mechanical explanations are narrowing quickly			1
" questions and answers ' @entity112 ' radar @entity113 suggested that a pressurization problem may have been to blame			2
if the plane lost pressure and the pilots failed to don their masks within a few seconds , " they would become unconscious , " the aviation consultant and former @entity118 @entity117 pilot told @entity15			2
" the aircraft would continue on the last heading			2
" if that happened , the plane may have crashed in the middle of the @entity129 , nowhere near where the search is going on , he noted			2
how does he explain the loss of the transponder signal ? " it is possible that , even with the transponder putting out a signal , the radar controllers did n't notice it , pay attention to it or receive it , " he speculated			2
that would be rare , he acknowledged , but so too is the disappearance of a jetliner			2
and radar is " pretty patchy " around there , he said			2
the transponder broke the mechanics of the device may have been at fault , said @entity150 , president of @entity151 , which sells the devices			2
" they 're not supposed to break , but they do break , " he told @entity15			1
" sometimes the transponder itself could be off frequency , not sending the right pulse			2
" the boxes are located in the cockpit , within reach of the pilot , copilot or both , he said			2
each is equipped with an on , standby or off mode			0
and there is often more than one			0
" @entity117 would have at least two transponders , " he said			1
" what happens is sometimes you 're flying along and , say , your transponder breaks and reports the wrong code or wrong altitude , air traffic control will go , ' you need to turn it off because we 're getting erroneous readings , ' " he said			1
and , if one were to break , the pilot or copilot would have to flip a switch to replace it , something that a pilot stressed during an emergency might not do			1
an antenna malfunction may also have been to blame , but that would be unlikely on a @entity117 , which undergoes routine maintenance checks , @entity150 said			0
see more of our coverage on missing @entity5 flying below the radar flying below the line of sight of the air traffic controller is another way for a transponder to stop identifying a plane			0
" the higher you are , the better sensitivity you 're going to have to air traffic control , " he said			1
that would be improbable during a routine flight from @entity205 to @entity206 , the itinerary that the @entity117 jet was on when it fell off radar early saturday			0
he too cited the possibility that it was turned off intentionally			0
why might that have happened ? to escape detection			0
@entity150 recounted when he and his flying instructor flew into airspace over @entity215 without having communicated with air traffic control			0
" he goes , ' oh , my @entity218 , we 're going to get in trouble , ' flew 500 feet off the ground , turned off the transponder			1
they ca n't find you , basically			0
" thirty miles later , he switched it back on and the two completed their flight without incident			0
@entity15 law enforcement analyst @entity229 said tuesday he was not persuaded by any of the theories : " there 's still as many possibilities out there , maybe more , now that we know about the transponders being off and the length of time that plane flew in the air without them			1
it still leaves mechanical , terrorism ( and ) other issues as much in the air as they were before			1
" history transponders have been around since @entity247 and commonly used in general aviation since the late 1960s , said @entity150			1
it supplemented military radar , which was unreliable -- unable to distinguish a flock of birds from a plane , he said			0
a transponder for use in general aviation would typically cost from $ 2,000 to $ 7,000 ; versus $ 20,000 - $ 30,000 for a commercial airliner			0
there 's nothing fancy about the technology			0
an air traffic controller sends out a radar sweep that contains a microwave pulse requesting information ; the transponder decodes the request and sends back that information -- identity of the aircraft , its location , altitude and speed			0
primer : @entity276 what information does a transponder send , and who does it send it to ? a transponder is a radio transmitter in the cockpit that works with ground radar			0
when the transponder receives a signal from a more sophisticated ground " secondary " radar , it returns a squawk code with the aircraft 's position , its altitude and its call sign			0
it is constantly being radar pinged , helping air traffic controllers on the ground determine the airplane 's speed and direction , too			0
q. what does " squawk " mean ? it 's a four - digit identifying code that the pilot enters into a transponder for each flight			0
it helps air traffic control recognize each plane			0
@entity308 are transponders necessary ? primary radar is more basic , effective only at seeing the radar reflection of objects			1
it paints targets , displaying them with a blip on a screen			0
the bigger the object , the bigger the reflection			0
transponders enhance the reflected signal and provide the additional information for air traffic control			1
q. is there a way to use it to indicate a problem on board the aircraft ? there are codes for different emergencies			1
for a hijacking , it 's 7500			1
for communications failure , 7600			0
@entity276 how do you turn off a transponder ? there is a switch that you would move from " @entity340 " or " @entity341 " ( standby ) or " alt " ( altitude )			0
you could also pull the circuit breaker for the transponder in the cockpit			0
@entity276 why would you turn off a transponder during a normal flight ? there could be several reasons			0
one reason could be when airplanes get close to each other ( perhaps they are approaching an airport )			0
air traffic controllers may then request pilots to turn the transponders off or to standby			1
also , if the transponder is sending faulty information , the pilot might want to turn it off			0
planes are still visible on primary radar until they get below the radar 's coverage ability .			0
