-- life is good for actor @entity2			1
when his new movie , " @entity4 : @entity6 " hits the small screen saturday , he 'll have to watch it from across the pond			1
@entity2 is in @entity9 filming his next project , " @entity11 , " opposite @entity12			1
being introduced to the world audience as a romantic lead in back - to - back projects will undoubtedly bring attention to the 22 - year - old @entity17 with the quick wit and penchant for dropping f - bombs			2
it 's an interesting mix for a guy who is shy and has no desire to be a heartthrob			2
@entity2 recently talked to @entity0 's @entity25 about his career , his aversion to fame and why he 'd like some quality time with @entity30			1
@entity25 : what 's your emotional state like right now ? @entity2 : my emotional state is pure f * * * * * g numbness			1
it 's great , i 'm living my dream ! @entity25 : tell me a little bit about this latest remake of " @entity4			1
" what sort of trouble are you kids getting into in that water ? @entity2 : it 's a modern film , you know			1
it 's not nearly as hectic as the last one			2
there 's a lot more controversy and a lot more misty activity in the last one			2
this one 's about two high school kids who go on a humanitarian trip to @entity57			2
they get caught in a storm and get stranded on an island			2
it 's their journey surviving on the island			2
but as the journey goes on , they fall in love			2
@entity25 : based on what i 've seen , the costuming department had it easy on this one			2
@entity2 : well , kind of , yeah			1
we 're both wearing big jackets and beanies and whatever , and then we get thrown into this humid , tropical climate			2
as one would do if one was in love with a girl and on an island -- i mean , i 'd wear nothing , personally			0
unfortunately , @entity78 ca n't show my big			1
... @entity25 : ok , let 's leave it at that			0
but speaking of lifetime , they are all about television for women			0
are you prepared after this film to be a heartthrob and mobbed by women at every turn ? @entity2 : no way , i 'm going to punch them all out ! no , it 's very flattering and it 's great and it 's part of the industry and it 's part of my job , but i 'm very shy			1
i have n't had the whole " famous " thing happen to me yet , and i hope i never will			0
i like to sneak away in the corners and hide a lot			0
@entity25 : here 's my one dumb question : if you could be stranded on a desert island with anyone dead or alive , who would it be ? @entity2 : i like this question ! i 'm going to have to ponder it for at least 20 seconds			1
you know what ? it would be @entity30 because i believe we could make tennis rackets out of the palm trees and play tennis with the coconuts			0
and he would get so angry , and it would be so entertaining up close			0
i 'd be entertained the whole time			0
who else ? it 'd have to be an attractive girl			0
she would be nice to put in there			0
that would be a nice trio			0
@entity25 : i noticed you did n't mention @entity12			1
did you like that transition ? @entity2 : very nice			1
@entity25 : you 're now shooting the new " @entity128 " movie , " @entity11 " with her			0
@entity2 : people want to know all this stuff about @entity12			1
she 's a massive star in this film and she 's such an amazing actress and a great figure in this industry			1
but my experience with her and all the other stars in the film is quite normal			1
we rock out and we rehearse and we talk about the scene and we talk about the characters			0
everyone kind of voices their opinion and talks to the director and it 's just like any other film			1
all that stuff is left at the front door			0
we 're all kind of working together to create this cool film			1
@entity25 : it might feel normal now , but i can imagine you beat out some pretty famous names to play the prince			0
@entity2 : you know , i actually do n't know who auditioned for it , and i 'd like to keep it that way			1
it 's weird when auditioning for roles , because a lot of my mates go out for the same roles			0
you do n't want to know that you 're beating someone to the role			0
i think that 's the wrong attitude to have in this town			0
no one 's better , just different			0
they were looking for someone who was exactly like me .			0
