if you 're following the news about @entity2 , which now calls itself the @entity3 , you might think you 've mistakenly clicked on a historical story about barbarians from millennia ago			2
in a matter of months , the group seized territory in both @entity10 and @entity11 and declared an @entity13 caliphate , celebrating its own shocking slaughter along the way			1
" i do n't see any attention from the rest of the world , " a member of the @entity18 minority in @entity10 told the @entity19			2
" in one day , they killed more than two thousand @entity18 in @entity24 , and the whole world says , ' save @entity26 , save @entity26			2
' " in @entity11 , the group hoisted some of its victims severed heads on poles			2
one of the latest videos of the savagery shows a @entity34 man forced to his knees , surrounded by masked militants , identified in the video as members of @entity2			1
they force the man at gunpoint to " convert " to @entity13			1
then , the group beheads him			2
@entity2 has targeted members of numerous minority groups in the region , including @entity34 nuns , @entity46 and @entity47 , according to @entity48			1
@entity49 called thursday for an emergency meeting of the @entity51			2
foreign minister @entity52 said his country is " highly concerned about the latest progress of @entity2 in the north of @entity10 and by the taking of @entity57 , the largest @entity34 city of @entity10 , and the horrible acts of violence that are committed			1
" the @entity62 is considering emergency air drops to help thousands of stranded @entity18 , a @entity62 defense official told @entity64			1
the department also is weighing " other military options , " a senior @entity66 official said			1
asked about the possibility of @entity62 airstrikes , @entity70 spokesman @entity69 said thursday he was " not in a position to rule things on the table or off the table			1
" earlier this week , @entity2 fighters tried to seize control of @entity10 's largest hydroelectric dam , but @entity83 forces fended them off , the dam 's director said			1
" if ' is ' manages to consolidate its territory and preserve its legitimacy , an offensive jihad against all other countries will then be considered viable , " @entity84 of @entity85 , a think tank formed to combat extremism , wrote on @entity64			2
" @entity93 will now want to challenge @entity2 's appropriation of its key objectives and tactics			1
the only way for @entity93 to stay relevant now is through a violent and spectacular attack			2
although @entity2 may eventually be a victim of its own success , the real victims will be the thousands of innocent @entity102 and non-muslims caught in the crossfire of this millennarian struggle			2
" @entity107 leads call for action as the tales of horror trickle out from areas isis controls -- including @entity113 , @entity10 's largest city -- a growing chorus of voices is calling on the world to act			1
the most prominent is @entity117			2
" the holy father follows with strong concern the dramatic news from the north of @entity10 , concerning defenseless populations , " the @entity118 said in a statement thursday			2
" particularly struck have been the @entity34 communities , a people fleeing from their own villages due to the violence that in these days is raging and overwhelming the region			1
" " dear brothers and sisters so persecuted , i know how much you are suffering and i know that everything has been taken from you			0
i am with you in faith , and with him that has conquered evil , " the @entity107 said recently during the @entity137 prayer			1
" his holiness also sends an urgent appeal to the international community , in order that they may work towards ending the humanitarian crisis and protecting those who are affected or threatened by violence , and to ensure necessary aid , especially that which is most urgently needed by so many homeless , whose fate is solely dependent on the solidarity of others , " the @entity118 said			1
" an entire religion is being exterminated from the face of the @entity155			0
" @entity156 , a @entity18 , said in an appeal to the @entity10 parliament			1
she called it a " genocide			0
" @entity18 , among @entity10 's smallest minorities , are of @entity83 descent , and their religion is considered a @entity165 sect that draws from @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169			1
analysts : @entity171 must arm @entity83 " the world now faces two urgent challenges : to prevent the genocide of the @entity18 and to stop @entity2 from continuing to conquer swaths of the @entity177 , " global affairs columnist @entity172 wrote on @entity64			1
" bombing @entity2 positions would help save the @entity18 , but supporting the @entity83 is key to success on both counts			0
" the @entity10 @entity83 army , known as the @entity182 , has fought @entity2 but is " outgunned , " partly because the @entity10 army dropped its weapons " and fled when @entity2 rolled in from @entity11 and captured @entity113 , " @entity172 says			0
@entity172 wants the @entity62 to help arm the @entity83 against @entity2			0
the @entity62 has been reluctant to do so , wary that the @entity83 will try to break off from @entity10 and build a separate state at a time @entity186 is trying to bolster a central @entity10 government in @entity188			0
" if the @entity62 decided to help the @entity83 , there would be no guarantee that the @entity83 would n't later use those weapons to further their own interests , " @entity189 writes in the @entity19			0
" but what other choice is there ? " @entity189 notes that @entity10 has begun air strikes aimed at helping the @entity83 -- but , he says , " the @entity198 has proved itself utterly ineffectual in combating @entity2			1
" on wednesday , the @entity10 air force struck a building @entity113 believed to be used by @entity2 , killing 76 people , an @entity10 official told @entity64			1
but local officials said dozens of those killed were actually civilians who had opposed the @entity3			0
meanwhile , @entity10 's @entity206 militia is is training women to join men in protecting @entity188 if the @entity3 works its way to the capital			1
@entity211 , @entity83 intelligence and security chief , called for direct military assistance from the @entity62 in an interview with the @entity216			1
" we 've got to help our allies to defend themselves , " says @entity217 , head of the @entity218 on @entity220 politics , another voice in support of arming @entity83			0
" the other half of that equation is working with the moderate @entity11 opposition -- providing them with robust capabilities against the regime and @entity2			0
" analyst : build a @entity62 base @entity233 , a former @entity234 official who focuses on @entity220 politics and terrorism , disagrees on both fronts			1
at this point , " the definition of ' moderate ' in @entity11 is ' not engaging in cannibalism , ' " he says			0
" if we did not know about two @entity243 brothers in @entity244 before they carried out the @entity246 bombings , how could we know whom to trust within @entity11 ? " it 's too late to arm moderates as a means of curbing the violence in @entity11 , says @entity233 , who is now with the conservative @entity252			2
and among @entity83 in @entity10 , there 's a danger : " @entity83 leadership is just as permeated by , and just as close in terms of a working relationship with , the @entity258 " -- @entity260 's elite force			1
" in the past , the @entity83 have leaked intelligence to the @entity260 -- and they could presumably leak weaponry			0
" the @entity182 is also not as competent as its popular image suggests @entity233 says			0
he wants the @entity62 to accept an offer from the @entity265 , head of the @entity266 , to set up a base in @entity83			0
" it would kill two birds with one stone , " he says			0
the @entity62 could base drones or manned aircraft in the region to be used in the fight against @entity2 , and the @entity62 presence would help cut through some of the @entity260 influence			0
the @entity10 government would n't like it , " but at this point , it 's the lesser concern , " @entity233 says			2
" we could mitigate this with a request to @entity188 to approve			0
@entity188 has more to lose by not blessing this especially if we go ahead anyway			0
" but @entity69 , the @entity70 spokesman , said thursday that president @entity286 has made clear " there are no @entity62 military solutions to the problems in @entity10			1
we ca n't solve these problems for them			0
these problems can only be solved with @entity10 political solutions			0
" he added that @entity286 has " demonstrated his clear willingness to take the kind of military action that 's required to protect core @entity62 interests , " including personnel around the globe			1
but any @entity62 military action in @entity10 would not include boots on the ground , @entity69 said			0
@entity2 's cruelty could be its downfall but the @entity171 may have reason to take no immediate action , says @entity307 , terrorism analyst with @entity308 " unlike other @entity93 branches , @entity2 does n't seem eager to attack the @entity171			2
it has too much to lose , " he writes on @entity64			0
" while the @entity171 has never been comfortable with @entity311 in @entity26 or @entity312 in @entity313 , it has largely left it up to the countries of the wider @entity177 to deal with these militant , @entity317 organizations , " he writes			0
also , " the @entity171 may find solace in the fact that @entity2 has many enemies in the @entity220 and @entity13 worlds , " @entity307 writes			1
and with so many groups suffering from its persecution and terror , such " violent ideology and brutality makes its endurance over the long - term unlikely			0
" the @entity171 could work with populations in the region to stand up against terrorism as it did with the @entity331 who turned against @entity93 in 2006 , says @entity217			0
there 's also the possibility that @entity93 and @entity2 will fight each other so heavily that they inflict casualties and weaken each other			2
but the risks of inaction by the @entity171 in the immediate future may be too great , says @entity217			0
" isis digging in consolidating gains , " he says , " will make it much more difficult to combat in the long run			0
" " several @entity286 administration officials have told us that our national security is at risk from @entity2 , " adds @entity344 , who served as deputy national security adviser under president @entity346			1
@entity344 supports arming @entity83 and says the @entity62 should be willing to use its military power as well			0
" otherwise , " says @entity344 , who is now with the @entity356 , " what is the @entity286 message : there are huge risks , but we 'll just watch for a while ? " what chance do @entity18 have against group too brutal for @entity93 ?			1

the @entity70 does not say whether air strikes are an option
" what 's the @entity286 message ? " a former national security official asks
@entity107 sends " urgent appeal " to end the crisis
video shows militants force a @entity34 to convert to @entity13 , then behead him
