in his @entity1 opinion piece , " @entity9 " , @entity10 of @entity11 raises some interesting points about the ways that designing certain types of @entity7 projects could lead to bad societal results			1
unfortunately , mr. @entity13 ' column appears to be part of a larger narrative that is skewing the perception of the importance of advanced data analytics to economies , societies and families around the world			1
@entity7 is not merely the accumulation of vast amounts of information , but a collection of interconnected and interrelated data points that , when analyzed carefully , helps business leaders make decisions that lead to increased profitability and job creation , assists doctors and scientists in understanding critical factors about health care , helps policymakers better protect the public from potential terror attacks , and much more			1
to be clear , advanced analytics techniques go beyond merely describing the data that is available			2
if you want to make better decisions you decide what important data you need to know , collect it in ways that operations researchers can analyze , and think : what assumptions must i make before i proceed ? mr. @entity10 ' examples summon up the long discredited time - and - motion studies of @entity53 , whose observations of people at work led to horrid visions of people forced to act like machines feeding an assembly line			2
modern analytics are far different			0
for example , every year , the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) holds an international analytics conference that includes a competition for best work in analytics , @entity7 , and the applied mathematical field of operations research			1
if you want to examine an outstanding example of the way that @entity7 saves lives , look at the @entity74 , which won the 2014 competition for their quest to eradicate polio			1
in 2001 , with massive amounts of data about polio cases around the world , the @entity74 ( working with the @entity83 and consultants at @entity85 ) faced an important choice : direct $ 100 million in funding dollars and settle for controlling the outbreak of polio , or attempt to completely stop all new cases of polio ? by developing sophisticated mathematical models that leveraged the best available scientific evidence and field knowledge , @entity74 officials became confident that it would be possible to prevent any further cases of wild polio viruses from emerging			1
by coincidence , the @entity74 accepted its award in 2014 shortly after @entity101 celebrated three years in which its population of 1.27 billion people had not experienced a single instance of polio			0
as we contemplate the never - ending threats of terrorism , policymakers in the @entity107 and around the world wrestle with constant questions about the optimal resources needed to prevent attacks and keep people safe			0
@entity117 professor @entity116 ( and @entity62 president - elect ) explained in a recent blog post on the website of @entity121 how to examine data using the same staffing models used for telephone call centers			2
he then combined this sophisticated math modeling technique of queueing theory with a study he conducted of all jihadi terror plots detected in the @entity107 over a 10 - year period , resulting in a determination that an optimal staff level of only 2,080 counterterrorism agents are needed in the @entity107			0
( the last publicly available @entity135 staffing figure available in 2004 showed that 2,398 agents were dedicated to counterterrorism at that time )			0
professor @entity139 's recently published policy recommendations show that using advanced analytical methods is a compelling and objective way to make major public policy decisions about staffing homeland security and , by extension , the many other departments and programs that can benefit from strongly grounded decision making given limited taxpayer dollars and the goal of effective government			0
these are but two of the countless examples of how advanced analytics and operations research can appropriately leverage @entity7 to achieve tangible results and benefits			1
as with any field of study or any profession , poor methodologies and wrong assumptions can skew outcomes and perceptions			0
that 's why it is important to continue to educate leaders in business , government and even the media about the benefits of utilizing well - designed analytics projects and the importance of promoting well - educated and trained operations research and analytics professionals in business , government and academia .			0
