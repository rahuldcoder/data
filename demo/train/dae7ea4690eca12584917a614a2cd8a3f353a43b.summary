-- @entity2 president @entity1 met with his @entity4 allies in @entity5 , @entity6 on friday to talk about his plans for the war in @entity9 , his " front line in the war on terror			1
" protesters outside the @entity14 in february have a simple idea for the controversial prison			0
but the @entity2 war on terror has some dark secrets and @entity1 has n't really wanted to talk about them			1
in @entity22 , a crusading judge named @entity23 is reviewing the case of several men who say they were tortured at the @entity2 prison in @entity27 , @entity28			2
in @entity30 , senator @entity29 has been asking similar questions that people around the world want answered : did the @entity2 really torture prisoners , did it secretly transfer some to other countries specifically to be tortured and did senior officials authorize it ? @entity29 says : " we ca n't turn the page unless we first read the page			1
" there are ample grounds to believe crimes were committed			0
individual prisoners have described being tortured in @entity2 custody or being dispatched to other nations with the same terrible result			1
an investigation by the @entity50 also reported evidence of it			0
while he was in office , @entity53 said flatly " the @entity2 does not torture			1
" but the @entity53 administration defined ' torture ' so narrowly that its use of the word has been contested as well			0
the effort to find out just what happened has been moving slowly , both inside and outside the @entity2			2
the @entity1 administration has n't encouraged it			2
@entity1 said recently that " generally speaking , i 'm more interested in looking forward than looking backwards			0
" that 's easy to understand			0
millions of @entity2 are grateful to @entity2 's ex-president and his aides , as well as @entity2 soldiers and spies , for keeping the country safe after 9/11			0
any investigations or potential prosecutions could set off a national debate complicating everything else @entity1 wants to accomplish			0
but the @entity2 has signed international treaties on torture and war crimes , suggesting it 's legally obligated to prosecute any cases that come to light			1
countries in @entity79 , @entity80 and the @entity81 have found a way to face their secret crimes			1
the @entity2 has to decide if it wants to take its own turn .			2

leading figures in @entity2 , @entity79 want the @entity2 to answer torture *allegations*
claims come from prisoners and the @entity91
so far , president @entity1 has not encouraged inquiries
other countries faced up to secret crimes , now @entity2 needs to decide what to do
