-- an urgent humanitarian situation has become a major political conundrum			0
the surge of @entity5 children illegally crossing the border into @entity7 has politicians debating possible responses while scattered protests against the influx threaten to become an organized movement in coming days			1
even fellow democrats are criticizing president @entity15 's administration over the issue likely to linger through the november congressional elections			1
here 's a look at wednesday 's developments : rising anger " we are being invaded ! " screams a flyer urging nationwide protests this weekend against the tens of thousands of youngsters coming to @entity25 on their own from @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			1
the july 18 - 19 " @entity40 of protesting against @entity41 , @entity42 and the @entity43 " has a host of right - wing groups participating and promises more than 250 demonstrations at state capitols , @entity35 consulates " and on streets and overpasses coast to coast , including @entity38 and @entity39			1
" not in my backyard : communities protest surge of immigrant kids while the impact remains uncertain , the effort follows an increasing eruption of public opposition to government efforts to place the newly arrived youngsters in holding facilities across the country			0
earlier this month , screaming protesters waving @entity25 flags in @entity59 , @entity60 , turned back buses transporting undocumented youngsters to a detainee facility			1
on tuesday , protesters on both sides of the debate faced off at an @entity68 , @entity69 , boys ranch intended for temporarily housing child immigrants from @entity7 , according to @entity0 affiliates covering the story			0
some communities were more welcoming , such as @entity74 , @entity60 , where staff and community donations of food , clothing and toys awaited buses carrying about 40 of the youngsters to a local church last week , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity82			0
new polls @entity25 consider immigration the most important issue for now , according to a new national survey released wednesday			1
the @entity88 poll conducted july 7 - 10 found 17 % ranking immigration first , a 12 percentage - point increase for the issue since last month			1
other issues cited included dissatisfaction with the government at 16 % , the economy at 15 % and jobs at 14 % , with nothing else reaching double digits			0
as expected , more republicans than @entity100 chose immigration as the top issue			1
" with no solution to the current crisis in sight , and less than four months to go before the midterm elections , it is easy to believe the issue could still be a factor come november , " a @entity88 news release said			2
on tuesday , an @entity113 / @entity112 poll showed a majority of people back @entity15 's $ 3.7 billion plan to address the border surge , but far fewer approve how the president or congressional @entity99 are dealing with what the administration calls an urgent humanitarian situation			1
@entity0 chief political analyst @entity122 said such numbers show people were fed up with political stalemate over immigration			2
" i think they 've had it with both parties in this , " she said			0
" so @entity131 better get something done pretty quickly here			1
" @entity131 mulls over the issue @entity15 met wednesday with @entity135 lawmakers and then @entity136 @entity100 to seek support for his emergency funding request to respond to the border crisis			1
the president seeks to reduce a backlog of cases overwhelming the immigration system by speeding up hearings to determine who stays and who goes			2
his request includes $ 1.8 billion to provide temporary care for children in government custody , and $ 1.6 billion to bolster customs and border efforts while cracking down on smugglers			0
another $ 300 million would help @entity5 governments discourage parents from paying smugglers to get their children to the @entity25			1
so far , @entity99 have balked at @entity15 's request , saying they will come up with a smaller plan			2
unintended consequences : 2008 anti-trafficking law contributes to border crisis one proposal by @entity7 legislators -- @entity166 sen. @entity165 and @entity168 rep. @entity167 -- would change a 2008 law that requires immigration hearings for children from countries other than neighbors @entity35 and @entity174 who arrive at the border on their own			2
it would stop requiring hearings but allow children to request one , which would have to take place within 72 hours			0
the measure also would provide some additional funding , but much less than @entity15 seeks			0
while @entity99 sought to build support in both chambers for the plan , top @entity100 said no. sen. @entity187 of @entity188 called it inhumane , saying 72 hours was insufficient time for people seeking asylum from endemic violence and other social ills back home to make their case to an immigration judge			1
@entity199 head goes to @entity100 homeland security secretary @entity200 told senators wednesday he wants @entity131 to pass a spending bill and make changes to the 2008 law so his department can more effectively process and return immigrants			1
but lawmakers from both parties said they were not ready to sign onto his request			0
in a nearly two - hour closed session for all senators in the @entity211 , @entity200 pressed for a policy change similar to the one proposed by @entity165 and @entity167			2
@entity200 described the briefing as " very constructive and useful , " but lawmakers from both parties said the plan fell short			2
" that wo n't be enough , " said sen. @entity216 , @entity218 - @entity217			2
" we 're going to have to streamline the deportation process			0
" @entity165 said the administration 's plan did n't do as much as his proposal to quickly resolve the crisis			0
unhappy with the proposed changes , @entity227 @entity226 sen. @entity226 argued , " to make a wholesale repeal to the law does n't make sense for the country			0
" sen. @entity233 , the second - ranking @entity168 leader , said he was n't ready to accept any change to the 2008 law , which he said was designed to protect children who have been the victims of human and sexual trafficking and other crimes			0
" some of these kids have horrible experiences they 've been through , " said @entity233 , adding @entity131 needs " to make sure at the end of the day these kids are treated humanely , compassionately , and we do n't return these kids to a deadly circumstance in their home country			1
" the senators were told that the number of unaccompanied minors entering the country has leveled , now making up one in seven of illegal migrants to the country			0
@entity216 said there was an audible gasp in the room when senators were told the cost to taxpayers for caring for each unaccompanied minor now in the @entity25 runs from $ 250 to $ 1,000 per day			1
@entity168 split privately , @entity100 acknowledged a divided @entity100 caucus , with some wanting to maintain the existing legal rights while others were ready to drop the fight to secure more funding before @entity131 goes on its five - week summer recess at the end of july			1
signs of the divide on the political left extended beyond @entity131			2
@entity273 gov. @entity272 , a possible presidential nominee in 2016 , criticized the @entity15 administration for planning to send back most of the @entity5 children from the recent surge			0
" we are @entity25 , and we do not return refugee kids who find themselves on our doorstep back into war - torn or famine - racked places where they will face certain death , " he told @entity0			1
" so i think we have to act like @entity25			2
" at the same time , he acknowledged trying to prevent some of the child immigrants from being sent to a western @entity273 site under consideration for a temporary holding facility			0
" what i said was that would not be the most inviting site in @entity273			0
there are already hundreds of kids already located throughout @entity273 , " @entity272 said of his phone conversation with @entity136 domestic policy adviser @entity292			0
@entity15 , who wants to quickly send back immigrants with no legal basis to remain in the @entity25 , has to corral his @entity168 colleagues in @entity131 , warned @entity298 , a @entity0 senior political analyst			1
" he ought to be focusing like a laser on the question of getting some sort of legislation passed , " @entity298 said			0
