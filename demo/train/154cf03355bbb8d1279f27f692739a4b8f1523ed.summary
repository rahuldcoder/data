@entity1 spy chief @entity0 called on big @entity3 tech companies to do more to help governments combat terrorism tuesday , as he described social media as " a terrorist 's command - and - control network of choice			1
" in an opinion piece written for @entity1 's @entity12 newspaper , @entity0 , the new director of @entity1 government eavesdropping agency @entity14 , said there must be greater cooperation from the private sector to tackle the threat			1
his comments play into the continuing debate over the conflict between people 's right to privacy online and governments ' need to ensure national security , intensified by the revelations last year of former @entity31 contractor @entity29 over mass government surveillance programs			0
in a rare public statement , @entity0 accused @entity3 tech companies of being in denial over terrorists ' use of the @entity37			1
" they are exploiting the power of the web to create a jihadi threat with near - global reach			2
the challenge to governments and their intelligence agencies is huge -- and it can only be met with greater co-operation from technology companies , " he said			1
the extremists use such platforms as @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 to reach their target audience in a language they understand , @entity0 said			1
their methods include making use of popular hashtags for other stories in the news , such as @entity60 or the @entity61 , to disseminate their message , he said			0
they create slick videos and have learned that showing the full extent of their brutality turns people off , he said -- hence their posting of videos of beheadings that stop short of showing the moment of death			0
information requests @entity75 , @entity52 , @entity51 and @entity76 have not yet responded to a @entity78 request for comment on the spy chief 's call for more cooperation			2
a public policy communications officer for @entity50 , @entity84 , said the company was not able to break out how many of the requests for information made to it by governments relate to terrorism , but he said @entity50 is suing the @entity3 government for the ability to do so			0
in the six months that ended on june 30 , @entity50 received 78 account information requests from the @entity1 government , its @entity92 shows			1
some information was produced in 46 % of those cases			0
over the same period , 61 % of all worldwide requests for account information received originated from the @entity3 , with 1,257 requests in total			0
some information was produced in nearly three - quarters of cases			2
' noisy channel ' for radicalization @entity0 , who took the reins as @entity14 director on monday , said that @entity110 militants show an alarming ease with new media that presents a new challenge for authorities			1
" terrorists have long made use of the internet			2
but @entity110 's approach is different in two important areas , " he said			1
" where @entity120 and its affiliates saw the internet as a place to disseminate material anonymously or meet in ' dark spaces , ' @entity110 has embraced the web as a noisy channel in which to promote itself , intimidate people , and radicalise new recruits			1
" if @entity1 's intelligence and security agencies are to combat this effort , private sector firms -- including the largest @entity3 technology companies that dominate the @entity135 -- must do more to facilitate lawful investigations , he said			1
" i understand why they have an uneasy relationship with governments			0
they aspire to be neutral conduits of data and to sit outside or above politics , " he said			0
but , he said , " however much they may dislike it , they have become the command - and - control networks of choice for terrorists and criminals , who find their services as transformational as the rest of us			1
" the new generation of extremists is also helped by the additional encryption measures now widely available to users of the @entity37 and smartphones , @entity0 said			1
" these are supplemented by freely available programs and apps adding extra layers of security , many of them proudly advertising that they are ' @entity29 approved , ' " he wrote			0
" there is no doubt that young foreign fighters have learnt and benefited from the leaks of the past two years			0
" recent efforts by @entity75 and @entity172 to encrypt their latest smartphones in ways that would prevent law enforcement from accessing certain private data have alarmed the @entity177			0
fbi director @entity178 told reporters in recent weeks that he was " very concerned " that the companies were " marketing something expressly to allow people to place themselves above the law			2
" ' lost insight ' a former top @entity3 intelligence official also told @entity78 last month that ripping the cover off secret @entity3 surveillance programs had pushed foreign terrorists underground and out of intelligence services ' reach			1
" we 've lost collection against some individuals , people that we were concerned about we are no longer collecting their communications , " said @entity191 , who until september led the @entity192			0
" we lost insight into what they were doing			0
" @entity29 , whose massive leaks on intelligence - gathering programs resulted in espionage charges from the @entity3 government , has been living in @entity206 for the past year			2
in an interview in may , he said he had no choice other than leaking the highly classified information , since he believed the @entity210 was being violated .			0
