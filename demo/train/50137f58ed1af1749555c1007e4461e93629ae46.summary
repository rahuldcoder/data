editor 's note : @entity3 strategist @entity2 was a campaign consultant for @entity6 's presidential campaign and has worked on more than half a dozen presidential campaigns			1
@entity2 is a partner in @entity8 , a political and public affairs consulting firm that specializes in advertising			1
@entity2 says stimulus bill is a cover for a bold plan for government to rule key parts of private sector			1
( @entity16 ) -- two congressmen walk into a bar to watch president @entity20 's first prime - time press conference			0
the @entity21 says to the @entity3 ...			0
@entity22 : just watch the president tonight and you 'll see how to get this economy back on track			1
@entity28 : monopolies ? @entity22 : monopolies so big they will shame @entity32 and make them put the board game in a bigger box			1
monopolies so huge , they 'll make railroad tycoon @entity37 look like a push - cart operator			2
@entity28 : why monopolies ? @entity22 : in these desperate times , we ca n't afford to let @entity42 choose inefficient cars or wasteful health care			1
we ca n't let innovation run wild on @entity47 or @entity48			1
we have to make sure @entity42 are secure in their health care and jobs , their incomes and energy			1
to serve the greater good , we have to organize @entity42 's economy so it achieves the best possible ends for all @entity42			2
we ca n't leave that to chance			1
who knows what might happen if individual @entity42 make those choices in a free market and organize themselves ? @entity28 : a little less freedom , a lot more organization , all for the collective good ? @entity22 : my friend , we need a directed economy , where we limit people 's choices to those that serve the best social ends			1
our nation 's development is best controlled by monopolies , not some atomistic economy where @entity42 are free to make almost any choice and organize bottom - up , according to their own whims			1
that means , big , honking , all - powerful monopolies			0
@entity28 : but during the campaign , @entity20 talked about change , fueling " bottom - up prosperity			0
" this sounds like the same old , top - down , industrial - age stuff democrats have been pitching for years			0
@entity22 : you betcha ! bottom - up campaign rhetoric just ran into the top - down @entity92 establishment from @entity93			1
we 're going to create monopolies in the biggest sectors of the economy , starting with banking and financial services			2
even after the meltdown , that 's still the largest stock market sector , 16 percent of the @entity104			1
@entity28 : follow the money			0
with massive regulation , caps on pay and restrictions on risk and competition , we can turn the entire financial sector into a cross between a public utility and the @entity116			2
@entity28 : and then ? @entity22 : we 'll create an energy monopoly that would make @entity118 look like a gas station attendant			2
if it has anything to do with energy , we will control it , plan it and direct it			0
you are going to love your windmill			0
@entity28 : i 'm not feeling so good			0
@entity22 : that 's next			0
a health care monopoly alone will organize another 16 percent of the economy			1
choice and diversity are great , but not so much in health care			1
we 'll throw in $ 20 billion at the start for paperless health records			2
@entity135 , my friend , is power			0
you know where we will go : cost controls			0
@entity142 can be your doctor			0
you do n't need a lot of choice			2
or a good - enough choice			0
@entity22 : now that you mention it , we ca n't forget the good old @entity42 auto industry			1
to borrow from @entity155 , consumers can pick any color car they want , as long as it is green			0
@entity28 : who are you going to get to run these monopolies ? you are dealing with increasingly complex economic networks			0
how are you going to coordinate the sophisticated relationships , the subtle interests and ever - changing needs of millions of @entity42 consumers ? @entity42 have traditionally done that themselves , in a natural and organic way , one to another , through the market			2
who is smart enough to replace all that ? @entity22 : @entity170			0
@entity28 : you are making this stuff up			0
the president is n't talking about huge government - run monopolies			1
all he 's talking about is the stimulus bill			1
ireport.com : share your thoughts on the stimulus package @entity22 : of course			2
that 's the beauty of the thing			0
as long as we call it " stimulus , " we can pass almost anything that expands the power of government to command people 's lives			1
why do you think @entity193 's cover says , " we are all socialists now ? " @entity28 : i need a drink			2
do n't they serve @entity198 in this bar ? @entity22 : no. but you can buy one from a lobbyist			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : @entity92 think we ca n't let the free market rule economy
he says @entity92 are trying to *micro-manage* the *crucial* finance sector
@entity2 says they also want to make key *decisions* for health care
he says stimulus bill is being used as cover for *introducing* bigger government
