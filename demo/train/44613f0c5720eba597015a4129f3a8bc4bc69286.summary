-- just like any other night in the @entity1 , the starting lineups of the @entity3 and visiting @entity4 were introduced over the public address system			1
but wednesday was n't just any night at @entity7 's @entity6			1
and the loudest ovations were not for members of either team			1
@entity11 , 12 , who is rapidly losing his eyesight due to retinitis pigmentosa , was in the house to fulfill his final seeing wish : watch his beloved @entity3 play a game			1
" @entity20 ! " flashed on all four sides of the @entity18 to thunderous applause			1
" i 'm quite excited to be here for the game , " @entity21 told @entity0 affiliate @entity22			1
while the reason for his long journey from @entity31 , @entity32 , was distressing , the circumstances that brought two communities on opposite sides of the planet together were extraordinary			1
@entity21 's progressive disorder will eventually deteriorate his vision			1
faced with the grim reality that he will soon lose the ability to see the world around him , his parents wanted to give their youngest of five children an international sightseeing tour			1
" this year we 're going to try and fill his world with as many beautiful images as we can , " his mother , @entity42 , told @entity0			2
@entity21 was instructed to make something of an ocular bucket list -- things and places he 'd like to see for the first , only and likely last time			2
he picked places such as the @entity51 , @entity52 , the @entity53 and , in a sign of the times , @entity57 headquarters in @entity58			2
but the thing he wanted to experience the most was n't a landmark or a national park			2
an avid sports fan , @entity21 wanted to take in a game			1
and not just any game -- the @entity3			1
" for some reason , he really got hooked on @entity69 basketball , " his mom said			2
" he cares about nothing else			2
he is really quite passionate about it			2
" making the list was the easy part			2
getting there , however , would be trickier			2
with @entity21 's eyesight rapidly fading -- by 50 % in the past year alone -- the trip was going to have to be soon			2
like , matter - of - weeks soon			0
@entity77 , the ceo of a @entity7 - based software firm , stepped in with a hefty donation and the promise to raise even more			0
the fact that @entity77 's company is based in @entity7 -- the very place @entity21 was headed -- had nothing to do with why he got involved			0
" that was a random coincidence , " he told @entity0			0
" i did it because the @entity86 are my next - door neighbors			0
" @entity77 makes the 24 - hour - plus trek from his @entity31 home to his office in downtown @entity7 every six weeks			0
he got @entity90 to pick up @entity21 's airfare tab and donated his own points as well			0
@entity77 and his partners at @entity94 agreed to pay for the trip no matter how much was raised while friends and strangers from opposite sides of the planet donated about $ 25,000 in just four weeks			0
" it is so touching , " @entity42 said			0
" people are just so supportive			0
" the fundraising campaign soon picked up steam on social media , reaching strangers far and wide			0
" somebody tweeted me an article about this boy in @entity32 and told me i should read it , " said @entity106 , who lives outside of @entity7			1
@entity111 is the incoming chair of the trustees at the @entity114 , one of the oldest schools for the visually impaired in the country			0
her son , 21 - year - old @entity118 , was blinded by a condition similar to @entity21 's			0
" i completely understood where the @entity86 were coming from in wanting to build a visual memory bank for ( @entity122 ) , " @entity106 said			0
" it 's an incredibly difficult thing to have to go through			0
" but that was n't the only coincidence ; @entity106 's husband just so happens to own the @entity3			1
" of course when i read about how he was a big @entity3 fan , i knew that we had to have him come for a game , " she said			1
the coincidences did n't end there			0
when @entity111 learned that the @entity86 would be coming to @entity7 for their game on march 5 , she realized she would be unable to give @entity21 her seats because she had given them away			1
" march 5th had coincidentally been scheduled as @entity135 at the @entity6 ( home of the @entity3 ) , " she said			1
" we 'd already given away our seats to the school 's students , families and donors			0
" while @entity111 made sure @entity21 and his family had great seats -- practically on the @entity3 bench -- she says the real show was the @entity148 chorus singing the national anthem			1
" i think for a 12 - year - old like @entity21 , for him to be able to watch visually - impaired kids perform the national anthem on a national stage , for him to see what blind people can achieve , that 's going to give him the lasting memory , " she said			1
and his @entity7 trip was filled with other coincidences as well			0
he spent the day tuesday at the @entity160 , whose cutting - edge ocular research may one day turn @entity21 's " farewell to vision " tour into simply one heck of a trip			1
those odds might be long , but smart money would n't bet against @entity21			0
he seems to have serendipity on his side .			0

@entity172 , 12 , may soon lose his vision due to rare *disease*
he attended a @entity3 game wednesday night , thanks to *generous* donations
the @entity32 boy got thunderous applause at the game
