@entity0 -- " if you want to experience the essence of a foreign destination on a short visit , " says @entity2 , " then nothing beats sampling the local food			1
the @entity10 journalist and food - blogger is speaking at the end of a journey that has seen her traverse @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and the @entity18 in under 24 hours			1
this whistle - stop @entity20 tour is part of @entity24 's @entity23 mission to consume 100 unique meals in 100 countries			1
so far she has eaten in a grand total of 62 different nations and visited all corners of the globe , from @entity32 to @entity33 and @entity34 to @entity35			1
" food is an entirely sensory experience			1
you can touch it , you can smell it , you can taste it			1
what better way is there to learn about a place you 've never been before , " she asks			1

and along her culinary way she has worked out how to make the most of interesting locales on a tight schedule , a scenario that will be familiar to many a business traveler			1
" i use social media a lot when i travel			1
i use it to connect with locals and get recommendations			2
i find it more effective than guidebooks because things can often go out of date quickly			2
" " for example i was in recently in @entity74 so i reached out on @entity75 about places to go in @entity77			2
a wine reporter in @entity79 got back and recommended a friends wine bar			2
" being able to go out and enjoy the best activities and places to eat is all the easier with a little forward planning , @entity49 says			1
social media is a fantastic aid for this but a lot of the time nothing beats the pleasant surprises that arise from chatting to the locals and following your gut , she adds			2
" when you are traveling for a limited amount of time , go to a local coffee shop and talk to the bartender , talk to the taxi drivers			2
" " you have to put yourself out there			2
you can learn about their words for different types of food and drink			1
i like to say that i can say ' can i have a beer please ' in every language			2
" " i asked for a beer once in @entity109 and they freaked out because they thought i spoke @entity112			2
it was a great ice breaker and people should n't be afraid to look stupid			0
" see also : flying chefs serve up fine dining in the sky but inherent with such adventurous , free - spirited tactics lurk some obvious dangers			0
namely , remaining safe in unfamiliar environments and ensuring nothing gastronomically upsetting is consumed			0
as any road warrior will testify , such misfortunes are hard to plan for and can end up eating into precious business or recreational time			0
" as a woman traveling alone , i find myself constantly on guard , much more so than if i were a man , or traveling in a group , " @entity49 explains			1
as far as ensuring dietary discipline meanwhile , she employs a thorough checklist which has hitherto kept her on the straight and narrow			0
" i have a three step process , " she advises			0
" i eat a lot of spicy foods			0
this is a preventative thing to kill germs and is something i really believe works			0
" " i drink alcohol			0
i 'll have a beer , wine or even the local moonshine like grappa or ouzo depending on where you are			0
it can be really powerful but it kills the germs			0
" " the other thing i do is eat lots of local yoghurt			0
yoghurt is full of good bacteria			0
so you 're consuming local bacteria and i find that that 's the best			0
" see also : seven ways to go local when traveling but while vigilance and discipline is essential in these matters , @entity49 is clear they should n't dominate perceptions or subtract from the joys of travel			1
going to far flung places and not taking advantage of all the great foods and cultural activities on offer would be too much of a waste to consider , she says			0
" when you get to where you 're going , you just have to be open and remember that 's what most expensive is n't always best			0
" " i 've had some expensive meals that i could n't care less about			1
but there are so many times when i have total food freak - outs , generally yelling to the stranger next to me , ' i 've never had this before , and i love it			1
' " " it 's these little things along with meeting the people along the way that make traveling so great			0
