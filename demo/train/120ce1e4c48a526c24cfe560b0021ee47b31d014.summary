help for the infrequent traveler if you are flying this holiday season and rarely fly , here 's a bit of helpful holiday advice from the @entity78 : what about my shampoo and conditioner ? follow the @entity78 's 3 - 1 - 1 rule			1
if you want to travel with liquids in your carry - on bags , you can most likely bring them in bottles that hold 3.4 ounces or less , placed in one quart - sized , clear , plastic , zipped bag			2
( one bag per passenger , please			2
) frequent business travelers : just because you carried more bottles on your weekly trips does n't mean you will be allowed during the holidays			2
these flights will likely be full , and you do n't want to be the one slowing down your @entity78 security line			2
travelers with medication , disabilities or medical conditions			0
people can travel with their medication , but make sure to tell the @entity78 officers at the start of the screening			2
and there are rules to follow			0

why not wait until you land to wrap them ? do n't carry a knife			0
knives are still prohibited in carry - on luggage , but they can be placed in checked luggage			0
( yes , there was a debate earlier in the year about knives , but the knives did n't win the right to fly in the passenger cabins			0
) do n't carry a gun			0
passengers carrying guns up to a @entity78 security checkpoint can be subject to arrest and prosecution , even if bringing your weapon was an accident			0
check @entity78 and airline regulations before trying to transport firearms and ammunition			0

the @entity157 has eased up rules on the use of portable electronics devices aboard airlines flying within the @entity4 , so you may be able to watch a downloaded movie or read an e-book below 10,000 feet			2
but check your airline 's website first to make sure it 's gotten approval from the @entity157			0
