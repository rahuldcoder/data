@entity0 -- as president @entity5 and his administration make their case for a military strike against @entity9 , officials from the president on down worry the regime 's chemical weapons stockpiles could eventually endanger @entity13 's friends			1
" if fighting spills beyond @entity9 's borders , these weapons could threaten allies like @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , " the president said in his speech to the nation tuesday night			1
the administration and its allies are careful to make sure the case to launch military action against @entity9 is not seen as being solely motivated by the desire to protect @entity13 's closest friend in the region : @entity23			1
is the @entity31 arming @entity9 rebels ? as part of its effort to build support for its position , the administration has reached out to @entity13 - @entity39 leaders and groups , several sources familiar with the effort confirmed to @entity1			1
with the holiest days of the @entity39 calendar being observed -- @entity44 begins at sundown on friday -- the @entity46 has had several conference calls with hundreds of rabbis just as they are readying the content of their sermons			2
@entity5 participated in a previously scheduled call two weeks ago in which @entity9 was a major topic , and deputy national security adviser @entity54 took part in a special call tuesday with 700 rabbis solely on @entity9			2
rabbi @entity58 , executive vice president of the @entity59 , helped organize tuesday 's session with @entity54			0
she told @entity1 she solicited questions from the participating rabbis who mostly wanted to ask about the " complex moral and ethical concerns " of the @entity9 issue , such as the possible unintended consequences			0
" that is what the rabbis were looking for -- more details about how they are addressing " those questions since @entity9 is going to be a major theme of their holiday sermons			0
" this is not an @entity23 issue , " @entity58 said			2
" the jewish community is always concerned about issues in the @entity78 as we ought to be			0
" however , @entity23 and the impact of @entity9 are part of the unspoken equation			2
one argument made by the administration centers on @entity85 -- concerns about its nuclear capabilities and how strongly the @entity13 is willing to push @entity85 are major points of interest for the @entity39 community and @entity23 prime minister @entity92			1
" a failure to stand against the use of chemical weapons would weaken prohibitions against other weapons of mass destruction and embolden @entity101 's ally , @entity85 -- which must decide whether to ignore international law by building a nuclear weapon , or to take a more peaceful path , " the president said tuesday evening			1
@entity105 slaps down @entity5 , challenges @entity13 exceptionalism the @entity85 question also motivated several groups to call for congressional action			1
about 250 - 300 activists from the @entity114 lobbying group @entity111 descended on @entity0 on tuesday , visiting 300 congressional offices , an @entity111 source told @entity1			0
" this critical decision comes at a time when @entity85 is racing toward obtaining nuclear capability			0
failure to approve this resolution would weaken our country 's credibility to prevent the use and proliferation of unconventional weapons and thereby greatly endanger our country 's security and interests and those of our regional allies , " @entity111 said in its statement last week			2
now that the @entity46 has asked for a delay in any congressional vote as it pursues a possible diplomatic resolution , there is not the same urgency to help the administration build support			1
@entity111 has put its lobbying effort on hold for now , an @entity111 source told @entity1			0
another major influential group , the @entity144 , also weighed in			0
" failing to take action would damage the credibility of the @entity13 and negatively impact the effort to prevent @entity85 from achieving a nuclear weapons capability , " read a statement released from the conference last week			2
all eyes turn to @entity13 - @entity153 talks sensitive to any criticism about why they are acting , community leaders insist @entity23 and its fate are not the reason			1
" the decision we reached was not because of outside pressure , " @entity159 , executive vice chairman of the conference , told @entity1 , adding @entity13 security concerns because of the violation of norms could be " dangerous in the future			0
" it " was not because of @entity23 ...			0
" for its part , @entity23 has avoided publicly discussing the possible votes in @entity170 on a resolution to give the president authority to strike so as not to be seen as trying to influence the outcome			0
also , @entity39 activists tell @entity1 that the history of the holocaust , the idea of a country gassing its own citizens , is a powerful motivator to help push the administration 's case			1
while many of the president 's allies in @entity170 have been reluctant to support military action , he did get some support from one of his fiercest critics			0
@entity193 billionaire and major @entity195 donor @entity192 , a major supporter of @entity23 , told @entity196 , " he is our commander in chief , whether we like what he says politically or not			1
" @entity192 , who donated more than $ 100 million to @entity195 causes in last year 's election , added , " i would be willing to help out the administration , because i believe it 's the right thing to do			1
he is our only - we do n't have any other commander in chief			0

@entity23 's fear of chemical weapons *attacks* is *fueling* *increased* *conversations*
jewish - @entity13 groups are *quietly* meeting with @entity46 officials
*conservative* billionaire @entity192 supports the @entity5 administration 's approach
