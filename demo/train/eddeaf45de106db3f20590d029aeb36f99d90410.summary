-- @entity1 began an ambitious project in 2004 : to scan and index the world 's paper books and make them searchable online			1
nine years later , the company has overcome a major roadblock in its mission			0
on thursday , a judge dismissed a class - action lawsuit against the @entity13 project brought by authors who claimed the project violated their copyrights			1
by sheer numbers , the @entity13 project has been a huge success			2
more than 20 million books and magazines have been scanned using optical character - recognition technology , making each word or phrase searchable , so snippets of text are part of @entity1 search results			1
it also has been a lightning rod for controversy			0
@entity1 did not seek approval to scan many books that were still under copyright , nor did it offer to compensate authors or publishers in any way , claiming the scans were fair use			1
the program does n't put entire books online for free			2
if a book is still under copyright , search results will only show the brief section that includes the word or phrase searched for and the page number it appears on , along with details about the book itself			0
@entity1 compares the system to a card catalog			0
books that are out of copyright can be viewed in full and even downloaded , and people can buy books whose authors or publishers are part of @entity1 's @entity58			1
" as we have long said , @entity13 is in compliance with copyright law and acts like a card catalog for the digital age , giving users the ability to find books to buy or borrow , " said a @entity1 spokesperson			1
because the company only shows " snippets " of the books in search results , it claims the project falls under fair use			0
fair use is an exception to copyright law that allows copyrighted work to be sampled or used in certain circumstances , typically by altering or using the original work in a new " transformative " way			0
" the use of book text to facilitate search through the display of snippets is transformative , " judge @entity83 said in his ruling			2
he said the @entity13 program provided benefits to the public			1
" it advances the progress of the arts and sciences , while maintaining respectful consideration for the rights of authors and other creative individuals , and without adversely impacting the rights of copyright holders , " said @entity83			0
opinion : why i took on @entity1 over orgy images the ruling notes that the majority of the books scanned are out of print , and that @entity1 provided digital copies to the libraries that allowed them to scan their collections			1
the books scanned are also primarily nonfiction titles , which have less copyright protection than fiction			0
the @entity1 database is used by researchers , librarians and educators and greatly expands access to books around the world by putting them online			1
by converting print to digital text , the program has also made it easier to convert titles into more accessible formats , like text - to - speech and @entity131			2
" this has been a long road and we are absolutely delighted with today 's judgment , " said the @entity1 spokesperson			0
