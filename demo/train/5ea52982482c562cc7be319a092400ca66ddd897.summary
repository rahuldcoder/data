-- twenty - five years after the hit single " @entity2 , " can the @entity1 pull off songs that make you want to dance like it 's 1984 , but still reflect a social consciousness of 2009 ? @entity8 and @entity9 , shown at the @entity10 in february , are releasing their 10th studio album			1
the answer is the title of their latest album : " yes			0
" the @entity17 duo will release their 10th studio album on april 21 in the @entity19 through @entity20			1
" yes " has been out in the @entity17 through @entity22 / @entity21 since march 23 , and entered the @entity24 @entity17 albums chart at no. 4			0
" we thought that ' yes ' just kind of summed up the theme of the album			0
it 's a positive , upbeat , euphoric pop album , " keyboardist @entity9 said			1
" it 's almost an answer to the question , ' is that the @entity1 ? ' ' yes ! ' " given how many different projects the duo has been involved with , it 's a valid question			1
in addition to the studio albums , they 've written a musical , " @entity43 , " and a soundtrack to @entity41 's 1925 silent film classic , " the @entity42			0
" for " yes , " the @entity1 worked with @entity44 , a production group known for collaborating with @entity46 and other pop stars			1
@entity44 co-wrote three of the tracks on " yes " with @entity9 and vocalist @entity8 , who write most of their own songs			1
watch the official video for " @entity53 , etc. " on @entity52 the @entity1 , who recently won an award for outstanding contribution to music at the @entity59 , " felt very much at home " at the house outside @entity61 , @entity62 , that @entity44 has devoted entirely to music , @entity8 said			1
every bedroom has a studio , and bands hang around downstairs waiting to record amid the sounds of instruments , record mixing and talking			0
" you can hear this cacophony of music all day long , " he said			0
like a vinyl record , " yes " is divided into two distinct halves : the happy pop introduction and the more " weird " experimental conclusion , @entity8 said			1
the album also features guitar performances by @entity79			0
" @entity53 , etc. " , the album 's first track and currently no. 2 on the @entity92 chart , is a social statement about how money , shopping and celebrity do n't necessarily bring happiness , while the third track , " beautiful people , " imagines that it must be great to have wealth and fame , @entity8 said			1
" at the end of the day , it 's an old - fashioned sentiment , but love is more important , really , " @entity9 said of " @entity53 , etc. " " pandemonium , " a love song inspired by the relationship between actress @entity98 and singer @entity99 , was originally written for @entity100 to sing , but she did n't use it , @entity8 said			1
media reports that they 'll never work together again are incorrect , however , he said			0
" i think they exaggerated that , " @entity8 said			1
" yeah , so that 's not true			0
" ( in a @entity106 story , @entity8 and @entity9 said they , like many songwriters , had n't heard back from @entity100 after submitting their material			1
" we wo n't be doing it again , " @entity9 told the @entity106			1
) perhaps the most out - of - character song stylistically is the finale , " @entity113 , " a meditation on politicians leaving office ( " you 'll get over it " is the main message )			0
@entity8 identified it as his favorite because of the poetry and the mystery in the music -- " it continues to fascinate me , " he said			1
" the way it used to be , " a favorite track for both boys , charts a relationship from its romantic beginning to its melancholic end , wondering " what is left of love " and longing to " leave our promises behind / rewind and try again			0
" with all this talk of love , @entity8 is private about his own love life			1
as far as love in the album goes , though , " some of it 's real , and some imagination ; some of it 's memory , " he said			0
the duo did not meet in a pet shop , but in an an electronics shop in @entity61 in 1981			1
@entity8 needed a piece of equipment for his synthesizer and , when he and @entity9 started talking about music , the two hit it off			1
" i 'm always struck since then by the sort of amazing look of our meeting , " @entity8 said			1
" we happened to be in the same place at the same time , and it changed the rest of our lives			0
i always think it was an extraordinary thing			0
" they started making music as a hobby with an acoustic guitar and a synthesizer , and played drums by banging on the table , @entity9 said			2
" it 's all been a gradual process really			0
we never sat down really and said , ' let 's become pop stars , ' " @entity9 said			2
when they first recorded " @entity2 " together , the musical group did not have a name , @entity8 said			2
they took the name @entity1 because they had friends who worked at a pet shop in @entity61 known as the " pet shop boys			1
" they thought the name fit with popular rap groups such as the @entity183			0
" it has actually no meaning whatsoever			0
@entity9 used to be embarrassed by it , " @entity8 said			1
while influenced by hip - hop , electronic disco , and other genres from the beginning , the @entity1 have always emphasized the songs themselves , @entity9 said , and they 're not " purist " about what kinds of instruments get used			1
in the beginning , they sampled everything from animal noises to broken glass for their songs			0
they even recorded the sound of a woman walking down a street in high heels for " @entity2 , " and the ambience of a cathedral for the 1987 single " it 's a @entity206 , " @entity9 said			2
their songwriting has perhaps gotten more sophisticated and experimental over time , @entity8 said			2
" in the ' 80s i never sang any harmonies on records			2
now i do loads of harmonies			0
i 'm turning into @entity212 ! " @entity8 said			2
" yes " continues the @entity1 ' tradition of having one - word titles for albums , such as " please , " " bilingual , " and the more recent " fundamental			2
" the convention just developed and became a style that the duo decided to keep , @entity8 said			2
" it 's like e.e			0
cummings not having any capital letters -- it 's a signature thing , " @entity8 said			2
the duo is determined to branch into new areas			0
@entity9 and @entity8 's next project is a ballet slated for 2011 based on a story by @entity229			1
@entity8 said it is instrumental , and includes a mixture of electronic music and strings			2
" the challenge of telling a story through music and dance is something that we 're interested in , " @entity9 said			0
plans to tour the @entity19 in the fall are under discussion , the duo said .			0

the @entity1 ' new album comes out in the @entity19 on april 21
" @entity250 " has two distinct parts : the upbeat introduction and the more mysterious end
@entity252 @entity8 says he never sang any harmonies in the 1980s
