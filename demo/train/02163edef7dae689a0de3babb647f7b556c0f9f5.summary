-- october 29 , 2009 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 , @entity5 @entity6 @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity14 , @entity15 : today marks a milestone for the stock market , one that most people probably do n't want to celebrate			1
we 'll explain why in a bit			2
sitting in for @entity24 , i 'm @entity25			2
first up : @entity26 @entity27 : first up , officials in @entity5 are speaking out against the most violent attack to strike the country this year			1
it happened yesterday in the city of @entity4 , when a car bomb exploded in a busy marketplace that 's popular with women			1
more than a hundred people were killed by the blast and at least 200 others were injured			2
the bomb sparked fires that quickly spread through nearby fabric stores			2
the attack happened just hours after secretary of state @entity43 arrived in @entity5 to take part in meetings about the nation 's fight against the @entity48			1
she issued a challenge to the people responsible for yesterday 's violence			1
@entity43 , @entity53 secretary of state : if the people behind these attacks were so sure of their beliefs , let them join the political process			1
let them come forth to the people of @entity5 in this democracy and make their case that they do n't want girls to go to school ; that they want women to be kept back ; that they believe that they have all the answers and that the rest of us who are people of faith have none			1
@entity70 @entity27 : back in @entity6 , president @entity71 has signed a law that makes it a federal crime to assault someone because of his or her sexual orientation			1
the new legislation was included in a defense spending bill and it expands on the government 's existing hate crimes law			1
some critics of the expanded law argue that it 's not necessary to specify one particular group			1
they believe the existing hate crimes law protected people based on their sexual orientation			2
there 's also some concern that the law could be used against people who may say something controversial , although government officials say it will only be used in the case of violent acts			1
@entity95 @entity27 : and president @entity71 took part in another ceremony yesterday , this one honoring @entity98 , who you see there on the right			2
he was the first @entity103 elected to the @entity104 by popular vote			2
and yesterday , mr. @entity98 was awarded a @entity95 , @entity107 ' highest civilian honor			2
@entity108 served as a @entity109 senator from @entity110 from 1967 to 1979			0
during yesterday 's ceremony , president @entity71 said @entity108 ran for office in order to bring people together who had never been together before			1
and former senator @entity108 had a similar message yesterday as he urged political leaders to put politics aside and come together			0
@entity120 @entity121 , @entity15 : today 's first @entity122 goes out to mrs. @entity124 's 2nd period journalism class at @entity125 in @entity126 , @entity127			1
@entity128 is the @entity130 god of war			0
who is his @entity133 counterpart ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) @entity139 , b ) @entity140 , c ) @entity143 or @entity144 ) @entity145 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! @entity139 is the god of war in @entity133 mythology			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity151 @entity27 : and now , @entity139 might help people reach @entity128			1
huh ? we 're talking about @entity154 and its @entity155 , which includes the new @entity157 rocket			1
after several days of delays due to bad weather , a test flight of the new @entity139 rocket launched yesterday , climbing 24 miles above the @entity163			1
according to @entity154 , this is the largest rocket in the world			1
the craft is scheduled to replace the space shuttle , and might one day take astronauts to the moon , @entity128 and beyond			1
before yesterday 's launch , @entity170 checked in with a preview of @entity154 's new program			1
( begin video ) @entity175 , @entity0 correspondent : on launch pad a , the space shuttle			1
it is the present and soon to be the past			0
on pad b , the @entity157 rocket ; the future , maybe			1
built to replace the retiring shuttle fleet , @entity139 would be the first vehicle since the @entity143 years to take humans out of low @entity163 orbit , perhaps to @entity128			1
@entity187 , vice president , @entity189 : it behooves us to build an architecture that can serve a multitude of missions for those next 50 - plus years			0
and that 's where this was first envisioned , was to think about space station , lunar , asteroids , beyond			1
@entity201 : the @entity202 has still not decided whether @entity139 , built with a budget as thin as the rocket itself , should be the shuttle 's replacement			1
@entity154 and the rocket 's developers have pressed ahead			1
over the summer , the rocket segments were put together in the vehicle assembly building			1
the upper part of the rocket is made up of dummy segments designed to mimic the real deal			1
the lower stage of four segments of solid rocket will burn for two minutes , producing 3 million pounds of thrust			1
the entire vehicle is filled with a web of 711 sensors			0
@entity224 , @entity157 program manager : the goal of an early flight test is to get the test off early enough that you can actually use that data to influence and make course corrections , if you will , to the design on the full vehicle			1
@entity201 : but course corrections might cause further delays			0
the first flight with humans sitting in a capsule on top of the rocket wo n't take place until 2015 , at the earliest			2
at least five years after the last space shuttle flight			2
@entity242 : booster ignition , liftoff of space shuttle discovery ! ( @entity246 ) shoutout @entity247 @entity248 , @entity15 : time for a @entity249 ! @entity250 's infamous " black tuesday " happened in what year ? you know what to do			1
was it : a ) 1929 , @entity254 ) 1953 , c ) 1987 or @entity144 ) 2008 ? another three seconds on the clock --- go ! october 29 , 1929 is referred to as black tuesday			0
that 's your answer and that 's your @entity249 ! black tuesday @entity27 : do the math , and that means that today is the 80th anniversary of black tuesday			1
it 's called that because on that day in 1929 , the @entity264 , which gives an idea of how the whole stock market is doing , dropped nearly 13 percent			1
it became the most famous stock market crash in @entity53 history			0
and many experts point to it as the start of the @entity273 , a global economic slump that would last almost a decade			1
@entity275 takes a look back at that fateful day			1
( begin video ) @entity278 , @entity279 : this is where everything started			0
and for centuries , this is where everything happened			0
@entity275 , @entity0 correspondent : the crash			0
no , not last year 's stock market plunge , but the @entity289			2
it all went down 80 years ago this week			0
@entity291 : 1929 was the greatest fall in the @entity264 over a two - day period			2
in today 's terms , it would be like a 2,200 - point drop			1
@entity296 : @entity297 and lifelong friend @entity298 give tours every anniversary of the @entity289			0
@entity301 , @entity279 : this whole area was filled with people who had come down to see what was going on			0
@entity305 : the tremendous crowds which you see gathered outside the stock exchange are due to the greatest crash in the history of the @entity312 in market prices			0
@entity296 : quite a shock , especially because the friday before , following a large drop , newspapers proclaimed the stock market crisis was over			0
@entity305 : but in october 1929 , the @entity250 bubble burst			0
@entity296 : the historic collapse was just starting , eventually leading , many believe , to the @entity273			1
@entity305 : and then it actually loses 89 percent of that value in the stock market crash in 1929			0
@entity296 : at the @entity324 on @entity250 , a ticker - tape machine from the crash days			0
the end of a mania for stocks based on easy credit			0
@entity331 , @entity332 : it 's leverage			2
i mean , we learned in the latest financial crisis that firms and individuals can take on too much leverage			0
that 's exactly what they did in the 1920s			2
@entity296 : a familiar replay to someone born during the crash years			0
@entity346 , museum visitor : it did have the smell of the same thing happening again			0
@entity296 : the crash experts say a famous story is true			0
at the market 's peak , tycoon @entity352 , patriarch of the @entity7 clan , hearing stock tips from a shoeshine man and selling stocks short , making a fortune			2
do you give out stock tips to anyone , like the famous shoeshine man of 1929 ? @entity364 , @entity365 : no , i do n't			0
no , i do n't			0
@entity296 : but he did shine the shoes of @entity7 's grandson , @entity367 says he is the last shoeshine man left on @entity250			2
i really had a bad year in the market , so i ca n't pay you right now , but i 'm -- no , i 'm going to pay you			0
@entity275 , @entity0 , @entity372			0
( @entity246 ) promo @entity27 : you 've probably noticed that @entity24 is off this week			0
but before he left , he broke out the video camera and talked to some of his co-workers about why they enjoy working at @entity0			0
you can check out their responses in the newest video on our @entity382 page			0
find it at @entity382 / cnnstudentnews			0
before we go @entity27 : before we go , @entity386 always brings out some interesting activities			0
like @entity389 's annual coffin race ! at least , that 's what these are supposed to be			2
they look more like man - powered go karts			0
either way , the event seems to be a crowd pleaser			0
basically , the boxes are put on wheels , and then contestants tear down a track that 's nearly two football fields long ! of course , the coffin race is part of a seasonal festival ... goodbye @entity27 : ... so it 's just about fun			2
there are no grave consequences			0
we hope to see you again tomorrow as we wrap up the week			0
