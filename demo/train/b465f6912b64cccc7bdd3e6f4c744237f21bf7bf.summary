@entity0 -- @entity2 announced tuesday it is banning all shipments of cattle raised in the @entity5 amid fears that the meat may have been contaminated from radiation at the crippled @entity10 plant			1
chief cabinet secretary @entity11 made the announcement			0
last week , a @entity2 health official downplayed the dangers after cesium contaminated meat from @entity5 cows was delivered to @entity2 markets and probably ingested			1
" if we were to eat the meat everyday , then it would probably be dangerous , " @entity19 , state minister in charge of consumer affairs and food - safety , said at a news conference on july 12			0
" but if it is consumed only in small portions , i do n't think it would have any long - lasting effects on the human body			0
" when the @entity33 investigated the farm that was the source of the meat , it found cesium in cattle feed such as hay , with radiation levels as much as 57 times higher than the ceiling set by the @entity2 government			2
up until now , cattle in @entity5 were only subject to a screening test , to inspect for radioactive particles adhering to the skin , and farmers were ordered to self - report how it the cattle feed was being stocked			0
@entity48 , @entity5 's officer in charge of the livestock division , told @entity1 that the farmer may have given the cows hay that had been exposed to soil containing high levels of radiation			2
the farm is situated about 30 kilometers ( 18.6 miles ) from the damaged @entity5 nuclear plant			1
four months after @entity2 's devastating earthquake and tsunami on march 11 , operators at the @entity10 nuclear power plant are still grappling with the crisis the disaster unleashed but say they are making slow progress			1
