-- dropping to his knees before the 10 cardinals of the @entity5 , dressed in the white shirt of penitence , @entity2 was forced to retract his " heretic " theory that the @entity9 moved around the @entity10 with torture and interrogated for 18 days , the scientist , who was imprisoned in the 17th century , promised to never again teach the theory and spent the rest of his life under house arrest in his small farmhouse outside of @entity18			2

@entity27 astronomer @entity26 , an @entity27 philosopher who argued that the universe was infinite , was burned at the stake			0
now in 2013 , as @entity30 settles into his new role as leader of the @entity33 , the @entity35 's head of science is urging a re-think of the " mischaracterization " of the relationship between the church and science			1
the @entity35 would like the world to see how much this relationship has changed			1
with the new pope being himself a trained scientist -- @entity30 graduated as a chemical technician before moving on to study philosophy , psychology and theology -- the timing could be right for a new era of cooperation between the @entity35 and science , building on the work of the @entity54 -- @entity55 , @entity56 and the @entity57 -- which was created by @entity58 in 2003			1
since his election as pontiff , @entity35 - watchers have been searching for signals about the direction in which @entity30 will take the church			2
even in his inaugural speech , he referenced the importance of environmental stewardship and an appreciation of the natural world : " let us be " protectors " of creation , protectors of @entity76 's plan inscribed in nature , protectors of one another and of the environment			0
" according to @entity82 theologian dr. @entity81 , pope @entity30 ' remarks suggest he may be planning to use his papacy to refocus the world 's attention on tackling global warming and other environmental issues			0
@entity30 to @entity35 : ' act decisively ' on sex abuse cases embracing science monsignor @entity90 , the director of the @entity35 's @entity91 , which was created last year , thinks that the new pope will continue the progress already made in building ties with the scientific community			1

" there was a time when theologians thought they understood everything , but we learned the lesson from history " , he told @entity0			0
acknowledging that the @entity2 era was a dark period for the church , @entity90 says that the modern - day @entity35 is much more careful not to tread on the toes of science			1
" if you look at what is going on today you will see that theologians are very careful about what they are thinking or speaking about related to scientific issues			0

this unusual marriage of church and biotech is a targeted public affairs initiative			0
the @entity35 aims to use the partnership to show people there is an alternative to embryonic stem cell research - which it vehemently opposes - that does n't involve the destruction of human embryos			1
" we want to tell people that they can easily feel like good @entity33 without any embarrassing situations or difficulties embracing science			1
" taboos remain but even some within the @entity35 's own scientific community have concerns about the the church 's firm stance on other matters			1
as well as embryonic stem cell research , the church , for instance , still rejects contraception , which is seen to interfere with @entity76 's will			1
dr. @entity146 , the head of the @entity147 and a @entity149 - winning genetic scientist , says in some areas the @entity35 's approach remains problematic			1
he works as an adviser to the @entity35 on matters of scientific development and regularly provides recommendations on areas of overlap between science and faith			1
speaking to @entity0 , @entity146 said that rather than dealing head on with conflicts between science and the @entity164 , scientists like him often had to avoid them : " i do n't propose certain topics which i consider taboo			0
unless we are asked , we had better not mention them			0
" in particular , @entity146 is uncomfortable with the @entity35 's insistence that condoms are n't the right way to prevent the spread of hiv / aids , which he says is " unrealistic			1
" the church maintains that condoms promote promiscuity			0
both the @entity178 and the @entity180 regard condoms as highly effective at preventing the spread of hiv / aids , which kills over a million people globally every year			0
@entity146 euphemistically says he 's hopeful that the new pope @entity30 will help the church " move things forward " when it comes to tackling @entity181			0
sticking points @entity188 , editor - in - chief of @entity190 magazine , also hopes the @entity33 under @entity30 will make an exception to its stance on condom use to fight the global hiv / aids epidemic			2
he says the speed at which new developments are emerging in the biological sciences is increasingly bringing about conflicts with the @entity35			2
in particular @entity188 sees this in relation to reproductive technologies -- such as in vitro fertilization ( @entity203 ) , and egg and sperm donation -- all of which the church says are improper methods of procreation			0
" the church is taking its viewpoint from 2,000 - year - old teachings and trying to apply them to a modern world , which is delivering all sorts of moral dilemmas , " he said to @entity0			0
@entity188 doubts there will be any significant change in the @entity35 's fundamental attitude to contraception under @entity30 and believes this will remain a sticking point between the biological sciences and the church			1
" @entity33 believe that anything that threatens the sanctity of life - including contraception - is wrong			2
that is a barrier and it will always be a barrier			0
" there have been no signals yet as to whether @entity30 will bring about a softening of the @entity35 's stance on issues such as condom - use as means to prevent suffering and early death			2
@entity146 is optimistic that the @entity35 will eventually catch up with the scientific evidence : " i have hope but - as with @entity2 -- it will take a long time			2
