-- from @entity3 to @entity4 , superstitious lovebirds and numbers geeks are reveling in a once - in - a - lifetime event : the date 12/12/12			1
sure , it might be just another set of numbers for some			2
but unlike the past 11 years , this will be the last such triple date for almost a century -- until january 1 , 2101			1
that means one last chance for couples to get hitched on such an easy - to - remember wedding date ( read : anniversary date )			1
those tying the knot at the @entity18 have 40 different 12/12/12 wedding packages to choose from			1
six of those options include an @entity23 impersonator			2
others include pirate , gangster and gothic themes			0
" besides a traditional wedding , the most popular is @entity23 in a pink @entity31 , where @entity23 drives the couple down the aisle in a @entity34 , " said general manager @entity28 , who doubles as an @entity23 impersonator			1
from midnight to midnight , more than 100 couples will walk or ride down the aisle at @entity18			0
that 's more than 10 times the number of couples who get hitched there on a typical wednesday in december , @entity36 said			2
" the charismatic and fun - loving couple that gets married on a 12 day is lucky and balanced , but seeking constant goals to achieve , " the chapel 's website explains			1
" the ' go - getting ' 1 and the ' sensitive ' 2 make this a very balanced number			0
" 1 is the vibration of ' new beginnings ' and starting things afresh			0
the 2 vibration is about seeking ' balance ' and that 's certainly something that many will struggle with -- balancing the bank balance , balancing the food and beverage intake , balancing the emotions ... balancing in every way			0
" for professional numerologists , 12/12/12 is n't just a cool repetition of digits or a lucky day for lovers			1
it 's a fantastic day to start a new business venture or make a significant purchase , @entity3 numerologist @entity64 said			1
according to numerology , 12 is considered a " three " number because the digits add up to three			0
and three is a very good number because it corresponds with the largest planet , @entity75 , in addition to wealth			0
( in case you 're wondering , @entity64 says the no. 1 " planet " is the sun , and the no. 2 " planet " is the moon			0
) " if you 're in a business of trading money , or the buying and selling of anything , ( wednesday ) is a good day to make investments , " @entity64 said			1
" if you want to buy something -- property , if you want to buy gold -- it 'd be a good day			2
" but wednesday is a terrible day to wear black , she said			1
" @entity94 is a very inauspicious color			0
" halfway across the world in @entity100 , @entity98 will turn 12 on 12/12/12 -- at exactly 12:12 p.m. , @entity97 reported			2
" it 's like one minute out of a whole lifetime , " @entity98 told the news site			0
" you know , it 's all 12s			0
" wednesday also marks a milestone for the @entity107 , where @entity109 @entity108 sent his first official tweet to the world			1
it 's unclear whether the pope chose 12/12/12 for the digits or for some other reason			1
but more than 600,000 followers waited to see what message @entity118 would offer in 140 characters or less			0
despite the weddings , superstitions and inaugural papal tweet , underwhelmed @entity121 users griped about all the brouhaha			1
" ladies and gentlemen , it 's 12.12.12 and ... ... nothing happened , " @entity128 of @entity129 tweeted wednesday			2
and nothing like it will happen again for almost 100 years			0
