-- " @entity2 " fan @entity0 is preparing to die -- and by the pen of @entity4 no less			1
@entity0 , a @entity5 employee , is one of the generous contributors to @entity4 's recently announced charity auction benefiting the @entity8 and the @entity9 of @entity10 in @entity11			1
as announced last week , the author of the " @entity14 " books -- which have been adapted into @entity18 's @entity17 - popular series " @entity2 " -- is offering a selection of prizes for fans who donate money to his chosen causes			2
a donation of $ 25 would be met with a thank you e-card , while a donation of $ 100 gets a campaign t - shirt and a thank - you video			2
and for a contribution of $ 20,000 , @entity4 offered to create a character in honor of the donor and put him or her in an upcoming " @entity14 " installment , with a bonus of the character meeting one of @entity4 's famously ghastly deaths			1
only two people could win that prize , and @entity0 is one of them			0
as part of the deal , he gets to choose his character 's " station " in the world of " thrones , " and the 30 - year - old really wants to be a @entity51 , because " for whatever reason , i thought the @entity53 were cool			1
" " i 'm just lucky enough to be in a position to do this , " @entity0 told @entity54 of his $ 20,000 contribution			1
" obviously , the money is going to charity , so it 's an added bonus			1
i did n't immediately seek to help wolf sanctuaries , but the more i read about the charities , i learned it was a worthwhile cause			0
" according to @entity64 , the two $ 20,000 prizes were gone within hours , much to @entity4 's surprise			1
" the outpouring of love and support has been far greater than i could ever anticipate , " the writer told the magazine , " and has left me astonished and at a loss for words			1
" perhaps @entity4 should n't be so shocked			1
" @entity2 " is now @entity18 's most - watched series of all time , surpassing even " @entity75			0
" for the most part , the reclusive author has been happy with how his epic " @entity14 " has been translated for tv , although he would make a few changes if he could			0
for example , instead of just 10 episodes a season , @entity4 told the @entity84 he wishes @entity18 would grant " @entity2 " 13 , so that " we could include smaller scenes that we had to cut , scenes that make the story deeper and richer			2
" as it is , the highly acclaimed " @entity2 " draws an average of 18.4 million viewers per episode -- and that 's even with gruesome scenes such as a recent death by exploding head			0
" despite my sinister repute , i actually find it hard to kill off characters that i 've been writing about for some time			0
good guys or bad guys , they 're all my children , " @entity4 told @entity64			2
but with these two new characters , " the slaughter should be easy , since the victims will be laying down their lives in a good cause			0
i will do my best to make their ends memorable			0
" @entity0 is n't sure what his character 's name will be in @entity4 's book , or how the character will meet his inevitable grisly fate , but he 's nonetheless satisfied with his choice			1
" i want to be a @entity51 if at all possible , " @entity0 told the magazine			2
" but he figures it out himself			0
i would n't want to impinge upon his creative process			0

a fan gave $ 20,000 to charity to be killed off as character in a @entity4 book
report : @entity4 says he 's been astonished by the support
the fan wants his character to be a @entity51
