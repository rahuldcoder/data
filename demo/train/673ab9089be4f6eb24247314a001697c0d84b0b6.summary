-- my name is @entity3 and i am blessed to be the youth spokesperson for @entity5 , a foundation that is very dear to my heart			1
few people have the opportunity to impact the lives of thousands , even over an entire lifetime			0
@entity5 accomplished more in much less time			2
@entity5 was diagnosed with neuroblastoma , a type of childhood cancer , shortly before her first birthday			1
around 2000 , at age 4 , @entity5 asked her mom if she could start a lemonade stand to raise money for pediatric cancer research			1
she wanted to help the doctors find a way to make other children like her feel better			0
she continued to put up lemonade stands until she lost her battle with cancer four years later in 2004 , at the age of 8			2
by that time @entity5 had raised over a million dollars for pediatric cancer research			1
i was so inspired by @entity5 's story that i always say " you are never too young to make a difference			1
" @entity5 has proven that to be true			2
today , @entity5 's parents , @entity36 and @entity37 , have continued her mission to find a cure for pediatric cancer			1
since 2005 , @entity5 has raised over $ 80 million for cancer research			1
in addition to research , last year alone , @entity5 provided over 100 flights , 440 nights of lodging , and 300 gas cards to help families travel for a child 's treatment			2
these are all results of people like you and me holding lemonade stands			0
every dollar we raise brings us one step closer to finding a cure			0
last week , i had the opportunity to join the annual @entity5 's " original " @entity5 at @entity5 's elementary school in @entity61 to help kick off @entity62			2
it was an amazing day			0
the stand brought over 3,000 people and raised nearly $ 100,000			0
the following day , i had a lemonade stand of my own with my 10 - year - old friend , @entity68 , in my hometown of @entity70 , @entity71			0
although we did n't raise nearly as much money , it was equally as exciting to see my friends and family join together for the same cause , knowing that it it could be any one of the dollars raised by @entity79 of us that will lead to a cure			0
@entity5 's dream is still very much alive			0
i hope that you will join me and the many others who are continuing @entity5 's dream to find a cure for childhood cancer , one cup at a time .			1
