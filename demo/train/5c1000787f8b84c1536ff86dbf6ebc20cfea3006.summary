@entity0 , @entity1 -- security forces in @entity1 appear to be intensifying their hard - line crackdown on demonstrators , with a second violent clash over the weekend leaving scores of youths injured			1
on sunday there were bloody battles on the streets between a youth movement and police			2
it was the second weekend in a row that police have beaten protesters with long truncheons			1
@entity18 20 , @entity1 's @entity20 youth movement , staged a rally in the country 's commercial capital without permission from the government sunday -- sparking waves of police violence and in some cases panicking from individual officers , according to at least one @entity31 video clip that shows an officer kicking and striking an old woman caught in the frenzy at least once with a baton			1
the same clip shows a young man on the ground being beaten and kicked by officers while other colleagues on motorcycles accelerate through crowds striking protesters with long batons			1
@entity44 , one of the organizers of sunday 's protest , said 15,000 people gathered in the @entity49 district of @entity0 to demand more democratic freedoms , jobs and better social conditions			1
he said police sealed off streets around the district to block people , swelling the numbers , then sent several 30 - strong squads of truncheon - wielding officers charging into the crowd			2
" there was a lot of violence , and we are now calling a halt , " @entity44 said			0
" this protest has again sent out our message demanding freedom			2
" yet perhaps it 's a message that has fallen on deaf ears in @entity71 , the country 's administrative capital			0
the government 's chief spokesman said the demonstration was banned and that police acted in response to what he described as provocative behavior by the protesters			1
the protesters " were warned that this protest was illegal but their behavior was provocative , " communications minister @entity82 said			1
he added that there had been counter-protests in @entity0 , @entity71 and @entity88 by citizens who wanted to express their anger at the damage to the @entity1 economy caused by the @entity18 20 protests			0
" we are concerned about the violence used ... we call for restraint in the use of force and respect of fundamental freedoms , " @entity97 spokesperson @entity96 said			1
" ... we call on @entity1 to maintain its track record in allowing citizens to demonstrate peacefully			0
we are following these demonstrations very closely , and encourage all parties to engage in a peaceful dialogue with a view to finding solutions to the issues raised by the demonstrators			2
" in @entity1 , unlike many other @entity114 countries , demonstrations are usually permitted , as long as a formal application is made to the state			0
the youth movement claims it has never applied for permits and it is just recently that the government is using this as a pretext to hit it hard			2
" now we are just a few weeks away from the constitution being announced by the king 's own committee and they do n't want any more protests , " said a protester who wished to be known only as @entity123 and who was injured in the battle sunday			0
@entity123 claims the police injured " around 100 people " who took to the streets sunday as an immediate show of defiance to the previous weekend			0
then , @entity1 police quelled a number of protests across the entire country , stopping supporters of the youth movement demonstrating against corruption and demanding more jobs			1
the may 22 demonstrations ended in a huge number of casualties and arrests			0
