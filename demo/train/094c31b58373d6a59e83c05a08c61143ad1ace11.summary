@entity0 -- @entity3 @entity2 are increasingly worried that an avalanche of outside spending by @entity7 groups will bury them this fall , putting more of their members at risk of losing , and jeopardizing their goal of winning back control of the @entity3 in 2016			1
virtually no @entity15 believes the party has a chance to pick up the 17 seats they need to regain control of the @entity3 after the 2014 midterms			0
but the @entity3 @entity2 ' campaign arm has been focused on a strategy to bolster democrats in competitive districts and try to knock off some @entity7 members in districts won by @entity27 in 2012			1
the thinking is that keeping losses to a minimum this fall better positions @entity2 for the next national election in 2016 , especially if former secretary of state @entity33 is at the top of the ticket and drives up party turnout			2
but @entity2 are facing an unexpected money problem			0
their allies -- outside labor and environmental groups -- are n't spending the kind of cash on candidates that the party expected			1
meanwhile , outside groups associated with @entity7 are flooding airwaves with ads in the final weeks of campaign season			2
just in the last few days several outside groups - @entity49 , the @entity50 , and the @entity51 -- rolled out television ad buys worth $ 3.7 million against four @entity3 @entity2 in @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			1
" we thought our friends would come in a way that they 're not , " a @entity58 strategist focused on @entity3 races told @entity1			2
the @entity63 has consistently outraised its @entity7 counterpart over the course of this election cycle , anticipating it would need resources this fall to counter @entity7 affiliated outside groups			0
but those efforts may not be enough to counter the @entity7 groups			1
@entity3 @entity2 are watching their fundraising advantage erode as @entity7 outside groups begin moving more aggressively into blue territory in the hopes of defeating @entity58 incumbents			1
" there has certainly been a drop off in funding from outside groups which is creating a funding gap , " @entity81 , the communications director for @entity82 , the one super pac dedicated to raising money on behalf of @entity3 @entity58 candidates			0
so far the @entity85 has reserved $ 21.5 million for television time this cycle			0
but without more outside spending help from others , that money needs to be used to defend incumbents instead of going on offense			0
one labor union , the @entity93 , spent close to $ 6.5 million in the 2012 election to help @entity3 @entity58 candidates , but so far , according to an analysis of campaign contributions posted by the @entity97 , the @entity93 is spending roughly ten times less - $ 665,000 - on @entity3 races this year			1
in the last midterm election , 2010 , when control of the @entity3 was up for grabs the group spent over $ 6 million to help @entity3 @entity58 candidates			1
@entity1 reached out to @entity93 but has not received a response			0
@entity3 @entity2 are having trouble in part because many of their traditional friends are laser focused on the @entity109 , where @entity7 seem are poised to take control for the first time in nearly a decade			1
the @entity112 ( @entity112 ) , a key @entity58 ally focused on climate change and health issues , is on track to spent a record $ 25 million this cycle but almost all of that money is earmarked for the @entity109			1
the group is n't making any excuses for keeping its primary focus on @entity109 races			2
" we made a decision a long time ago , " @entity123 , press secretary for @entity112 told @entity1			0
he emphasized that the group is working to protect the @entity109 @entity58 majority , which it believes was key to stopping a series of environmental measures passed by the @entity7 - led @entity3 from making it to the president 's desk			1
@entity112 has sponsored ads supporting @entity134 @entity133 and @entity135 , who are running for open @entity109 seats in @entity137 and @entity138			0
watch : @entity140 ad : @entity141 in @entity144 brothers ' pocket @entity123 notes that @entity112 did contribute to @entity3 @entity58 candidates in a couple of @entity3 races in @entity148 and in @entity56 where climate change has been a key issue , and that they plan to spend $ 100,000 on a voter turnout effort to help @entity58 candidate @entity152 in @entity148 's second congressional district			2
but with a bad political environment getting worse for @entity3 @entity2 in 2014 there is concern that being outspent by even more than they anticipated could put any hopes of retaking the @entity3 in 2016 out of reach			0
" it 's important that we go into 2016 cycle with a manageable gap that we can overcome in a good year for @entity2 , " the @entity3 @entity58 strategist told @entity1			2
just last week when @entity1 asked @entity166 @entity165 about her earlier prediction that @entity2 would pick up enough seats to win back the @entity3 this november , @entity165 replied her party would do " ok " but then she skipped ahead two years , saying , " i know that in two years , there will be a @entity172 and a @entity58 president			1
" while @entity3 @entity7 are feeling good about the midterms , they admit they could be doing better			0
they got a slow start and were never able to catch up with the @entity63 's fundraising edge			0
but they have similar worries that the outside groups who are helping their candidates are n't on track to spend at the same level as @entity85			0
and they acknowledge that while outside groups are investing heavily , the attention on the @entity109 has limited the amount of money they could use to pick up even more @entity58 - held seats .			2

outside @entity58 groups are n't spending the kind of cash the party expected
@entity7 groups rolled out ad buys worth $ 3.7 million in recent days against four @entity2
many @entity58 groups more focused on keeping control of the @entity109
