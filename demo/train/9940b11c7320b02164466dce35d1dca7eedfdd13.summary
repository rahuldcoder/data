@entity0 , @entity1 -- as a hangover " cure , " they do n't come more brutally disturbing than bear bile			1
extracted from the animal with a long needle inserted into the gall bladder on illegal bear farms in @entity1 and @entity11 , the endangered @entity13 black bear -- also known as @entity14 because of the crescent of white fur on their chest - is subjected to a slow death from infection and disease in tiny cages that restrict their movements			1
" in @entity1 , men in particular mix bear bile with rice wine because they believe it makes them stronger and able to drink more , " says @entity25 , @entity1 director of @entity26 , an animal welfare group			1
" it 's been used in traditional medicine for thousands of years and there are claims that it can cure everything from hangovers , liver cirrhosis to cancer , " he says			0
" people mix it with alcohol and rub it on their skin to reduce swelling			0
to that extent , we acknowledge that it does work , but there are alternatives ; cortisone , for example , or even @entity53			0
" last month , the animal welfare group marked a coup in its fight against bear farming			2
for the first time in @entity1 , a bear farmer acted on conscience , voluntarily surrendering his share of a bear farm -- with its 14 bears -- without asking for compensation			1
" if he wanted to sell his share , he could have easily done it underground on the black market , but he 'd seen the work we 've done and approached us , " says @entity25			0
" it 's the first time that 's happened with such a large number of bears			1
" at the group 's @entity76 rescue centre in the @entity0 , 43 miles ( 70km ) north of @entity74 , chief vet @entity73 said the decision by bear farmer @entity79 to relinquish his share voluntarily was an important development			2
" now that we 've had one person doing this we are hoping it will lead the way for others to follow the example , " says officer			0
in the sanctuary 's temporary quarantine cages , where the 14 new arrivals will be slowly rehabilitated over three months before joining the 98 other bears that live permanently at the 30 - acre site in @entity94 , the animals show signs of their recent trauma			2
some pace the cages , another is bald from rubbing its head repetitively against the bars , several have missing limbs -- a sign they were snared in the wild			0
" this stereotypical behavior is a sign they are bored out of their brains , " says officer			0
" there 's been nothing for them on the bear farm to express their natural bear behaviors , so they replace them with these very unnatural behaviors			2
" in many cases , the bears need immediate medical attention , officer explains , including the removal of their gall bladders and other organs damaged by the bile extraction process			1
the bile extraction process , she says , differs from country to country			2
in @entity11 , the bears are housed in coffin - sized " crush cages " to prevent the animal moving , making it easier and safer for an operator to insert a catheter , and in some cases to simply suture the organ to an opening in the abdomen so the bile can be drained continuously into a collecting tray			2
in @entity1 , however , the animal is sedated -- sometimes using illegal street ketamine -- taken into the open and a four - inch needle inserted into its abdomen and the bile drawn out			1
the non-sterile conditions can quickly lead to infection , a situation which not only endangers the bear but also bile users			2
@entity160 samples have shown contamination with everything from cancer cells to pus			0
some users , says @entity26 , have become seriously ill from using it			0
" there have been some recent cases of people being poisoned by bear bile , " says @entity25			1
" a few months ago , we heard of a case of 76 - year - old man who swallowed bear bile to help him get over injuries from a fall			1
" within half an hour his body was heating up , a shower did n't help him cool down and within two days he was in hospital with a severe reaction to the bile			2
his body was covered in red spots and his skin was peeling			0
it was a severe allergic reaction			0
" he said reported cases such as this have helped his group 's campaign to end bear bile farming but there was still a long way to go , especially since extracted bile is expensive and sometimes gains cachet as a status symbol among @entity197 's nouveau riche			1
how much the illegal trade in bear bile is worth is still difficult to estimate			1
" it 's hard to say because it 's illegal , " says @entity25			0
" but two years ago the police raided a farm in @entity204 and they confiscated all the records which provided valuable information on the trade			2
" from the records we could see that the farm had sold 80,000ml of bear bile in six months at between us $ 6 and us $ 30 per milliliter -- that 's at least $ 500,000 from one bear farm alone			1
" while it 's illegal to harvest and sell bear bile in @entity1 , it 's not illegal to keep bears if they have been in captivity before 2005			1
@entity26 says there are 3,567 bears held on farms throughout @entity1 , but a lack of enforcement means the trade continues			1
as many as 7,000 bears are believed to be farmed in neighboring @entity11 , with farms also known to exist in @entity225 , @entity226 and the @entity227			2
the @entity11 government has previously defended the practice , saying that farming protects wild bears which would otherwise be killed and harvested for their whole gall bladders , where the bile is stored			1
the argument is widely disputed by animal welfare groups who say farmed bile puts pressure on captive and wild populations alike			0
animals @entity197 estimates that wild @entity13 bears in @entity1 could now number in the hundreds and there are worrying signs that poachers are moving into the forests of neighboring @entity225 where the bears may be more plentiful			1
@entity251 is known about the animal in the wild and remaining numbers worldwide are estimated at anywhere between 16,000 and 50,000			0
@entity26 says it has reached an agreement with the @entity1 government to eventually keep 200 bears at its center , but the group admits its work is only a band aid when put against scale of the problem of illegal trapping and farming			1
their best hope , says bear manager at the @entity76 rescue center @entity269 , is to educate a new generation about the dangers of bear bile remedies			1
" in @entity1 , especially , these remedies are not thousands of years old at all , they 've been imported from @entity11 much more recently , " he says			1
" in @entity1 , it has much more to do with new wealth and with status			2
" the active ingredient in bear bile -- ursodeoxycholic acid , or @entity282 , which does have anti-inflammatory properties -- can be produced in a laboratory			1
the problem , says @entity269 , is that most bear bile is used in quack cures and folk remedies			1
" it 's the problem with many traditional remedies			0
people are told it cures cancer , then the thinking is if it cures cancer , then it must be good to have a shot of it every now and then , " officer adds			0
" the myths just keep being perpetuated			0
" for the workers at @entity197 , the struggle is not just to bring the animals back to health , but to avoid getting too comfortable around a highly intelligent and sometimes socialized wild animal			0
" we follow very strict protocols as far as safety is concerned , " says officer			0
" even if they 're hand - raised as cubs , at a certain age it 's hands off , " adding that it 's easy to let your guard down around animals that sometimes seem and behave like pets			0
" they 're very quick , " she says , looking at a bear eyeing its new surroundings and keepers			0
" but it is tempting sometimes			0

14 @entity14 have been rescued from a bear bile farm in @entity1
the bears were illegally harvested for their bile which is used in folk remedies
the *painful* process often leads to a slow and *agonizing* death for the bear
the rescue marks the first time a large number of bears was relinquished on conscience
