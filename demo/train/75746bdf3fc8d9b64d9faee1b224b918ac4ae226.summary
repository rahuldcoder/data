-- my participation in the @entity3 came as a total surprise to me			2
i am indeed @entity5 , with an @entity7 dad and a @entity9 mum			0
in the mid- 1960s , having married a @entity10 , i was living in @entity11 with two small children and enjoying a highly successful career in @entity14 , singing in @entity10 and other languages			1
but despite all that , when @entity16 , also a @entity17 , presented me with a song called " @entity19 , " i knew i wanted to record it			1
so we went into the studio in @entity24 and came out with a hit			0
it was rapidly picked up by @entity27 in the @entity28 , and without any promotion from me , took off to the prized no. 1 spot			1
and so i was propelled into this amazing and exciting " love in " with @entity28			1
of course , it changed my life			0
suddenly , i was juggling two careers and a family			1
it was exhilarating , too			0
i loved performing to @entity28 audiences , and i still do			1
they are the most generous in the world			1
i was spending more and more time in the @entity28 , working with some of the best @entity28 musicians and certainly listening to the great @entity28 bands of the day : @entity42 , @entity43 and more			1
it was wonderful to feel i was in some way part all that was happening at that iconic moment			0
the spearhead of the " invasion " was of course the @entity51			0
they opened the floodgates , and the world became aware of @entity5 talent almost overnight			2
@entity28 seemed to embrace us brits with something close to a passion			1
how could we resist ? of course " @entity19 " was only the beginning			1
there was " @entity62 , " " @entity63 , " " @entity64 , " " days " and more			0
@entity16 went on to write a dozen more hits for me			2
these songs have survived the ' 60s , and i still sing them today with much affection			2
those days were pretty hectic			0
i seemed to be constantly bouncing around between the @entity28 and @entity14 and was jet - lagged most of the time ! as for " the scene " in the @entity72 , i did n't get too involved in it			1
of course , there were the inevitable parties and general madness , but i could take it or leave it			0
probably that i was married with a young family kept me on an even keel			2
for me , the buzz was and still is all about the music and being around people who feel the same way			0
the @entity3 came and went , but left behind a body of music that lives on today			0
for those of us who were there , how could we ever forget it ?			0

@entity91 was living in @entity11 with her family and had a successful @entity14 career
when she got the song " @entity19 , " she knew she wanted to record it
that ' 60s song propelled her to fame in the @entity28 , where it became no. 1
other hits followed ; she calls @entity28 audiences the most generous in the world
