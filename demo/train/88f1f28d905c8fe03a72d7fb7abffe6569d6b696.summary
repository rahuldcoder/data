military convictions of two terror suspects will get a full federal appeals court review , testing whether the men could be charged with offenses that were not in place when @entity6 passed a 2006 anti-terror law			1
in an unusual move , the @entity8 announced tuesday all seven of its judges would hear an appeal from two @entity14 prisoners held for years at the @entity16 military prison in @entity17			1
most appeals of that type are heard by three - judge panels , which separately tossed out the convictions of accused @entity23 propagandist @entity22 , and former @entity25 driver @entity24			2
the @entity27 administration then requested the full court to hear the case			1
oral arguments will be held september 30			0
the losing party will almost certainly ask the @entity33 @entity32 to offer the final word			1
both defendants were charged with providing material support to terrorism and conspiracy for @entity23 , around the time of the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , offenses that were not included as crimes before the @entity43 went into effect several years later			1
that law established the tribunal system used to try terror suspects held at @entity16 , outside the civilian federal trial courts			1
the ex post facto provision of the @entity50 says the government may not retroactively criminalize conduct that was either legal or not on the record when committed			0
the previous appeals panels concluded only pre-existing federal offenses and violations of the international law of war could be used to prosecute the men			1
@entity59 and @entity24 are so far the only @entity16 inmates convicted at the military tribunals			1
five other men had separately pleaded guilty to offenses			2
other cases , including alleged 9/11 mastermind @entity65 , and other so - called " high - value detainees " are still awaiting trial			0
@entity68 native @entity22 was convicted in november 2008 of conspiring with @entity23 , soliciting murder , and providing material support for terrorism			0
he was accused of making videos for the terror organization			0
his conviction was overturned in january , and he remains in @entity16 custody			2
@entity24 was also tried in 2008 , the first man convicted under the new tribunal system			0
later that year he was transferred to @entity68 to serve out the remainder of his sentence			0
he had admitted to being the driver of the now - deceased leader of @entity23 , and was the subject of a 2010 documentary , " @entity83 , " chronicling his life and detention			0
he is no stranger to the federal courts			0
in a blow to executive authority , the @entity32 in 2006 ruled the existing military commission system to originally detain and charge @entity24 was not adequate , and the justices said @entity6 needed to come up new constitutionally permissible rules			1
that decision prompted @entity6 to pass the @entity43 and revise the tribunal system			0
the law also sought to limit federal court jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus challenges to detention , but judges have consistently said they do have the power to be involved			2
ever since the 9/11 attacks , federal courts have been asked to determine if detainees had the right to contest their imprisonment and the rules set up to try them			2
the current appeals court case is @entity108 v. @entity33 ( 11 - 1324 ) .			1

full federal appeals court will hear case of two terror suspects charged around the time of 9/11
the men were convicted by a military court and held for years at @entity16 , @entity17
appeal tests whether men could be charged with offenses not on books until later
the losing party will almost certainly ask the @entity33 @entity32 to review the case
