@entity0 , @entity1 -- tensions in @entity1 escalated sharply thursday , with @entity4 embarking on new military drills near the border after @entity1 forces said they killed five pro-russian militants			1
@entity1 's @entity9 said @entity1 forces killed the militants during operations to take down @entity14 activists ' roadblocks around the southeastern city of @entity16			0
the @entity4 response was swift			1
@entity4 president @entity18 said " if the @entity0 regime has started to use the army against the population inside the country , it , beyond any doubt , is a very serious crime			1
" there would be " consequences " for those making the decisions and for relations between his and @entity1 's governments , @entity18 said at a media forum thursday , according to state tv channel @entity4 24			1
shortly afterward , @entity4 defense minister @entity34 said @entity4 would conduct military drills in response , reported @entity4 state news agency @entity37			1
" we are forced to react to such a development in the situation , " @entity34 is quoted as saying			0
" starting today , exercises of battalion tactical groups from the @entity43 and @entity45 military districts will begin near the borders with @entity1			0
" @entity1 issued a 48 - hour deadline for @entity4 to explain its military drills , the @entity47 said thursday			1
the ministry did not say what @entity1 would do if @entity4 does not comply			2
@entity1 acting president @entity52 had strong words for @entity54 , accusing it of " openly threatening " his country with its troop buildup on @entity1 's eastern border			0
@entity0 's security operation is intended to protect peaceful citizens , he said , but in response @entity4 " coordinates and openly supports terrorist killers with weapons in their hands " in eastern @entity1			1
" with no reason to do so , the @entity4 leadership allows itself to boldly interfere in the internal affairs of @entity1 , " @entity52 said			2
" @entity4 supports terrorism in our country at the state level			2
" top @entity74 officials -- including president @entity75 -- on thursday vowed more punitive international actions targeting @entity4 's economy if @entity54 , in their view , continues to escalate rather than de-escalate the situation			1
@entity74 secretary of state @entity80 called @entity4 's actions " a full - throated effort to actively sabotage the democratic process through gross external intimidation			1
" " if @entity4 continues in this direction , " he added , " it will not just be a grave mistake , it will be an expensive mistake			1
" according to senior @entity74 officials , additional @entity74 sanctions against @entity4 could come as early as friday			1
among the targets for the new sanctions are key @entity18 allies , high - profile @entity4 oligarchs and possibly @entity4 institutions and companies , the officials told @entity2			1
the new sanctions " will be an escalation , " said one @entity74 official			1
more violence in eastern @entity1 fresh clashes thursday only underscored the volatility of the situation , especially with a reported 40,000 @entity4 troops positioned near the @entity1 border			2
that includes the killing of the five pro-russian militants and the destruction of three checkpoints around @entity16 , according to the government in @entity0			2
a police officer was also injured , the @entity9 said			0
meanwhile , @entity113 -- a spokeswoman for the self - appointed @entity14 mayor of @entity16 , @entity115 -- said an attack at an impromptu roadway checkpoint outside the city took the life of one @entity14 militiaman and wounded another			0
the @entity14 unit at the checkpoint told @entity2 that armored vehicles came to the roadblock but did n't fire , with locals setting fire to tires to prevent them from passing			0
the unit said a sniper killed one member of the " self - defense " group and injured another on their way home from an overnight stint at the barricade			0
@entity115 , visiting the site , also said a sniper killed one of the @entity14 activists			0
the government accused @entity115 of threatening to kill anyone possessing a leaflet that the @entity9 says asks people " to keep the peace , ... not obey illegal orders " and stay inside			0
@entity2 has n't independently confirmed reports of threats against @entity16 residents			0
@entity16 is n't the only city in the eastern @entity152 region -- where some have tried to declare independence from @entity1 -- on edge			0
@entity1 interior minister @entity156 accused roughly 70 attackers of trying to take weapons from a @entity1 military unit in the town of @entity161			0
security forces fended off the attack			0
there was also unrest in the eastern city of @entity167			0
@entity52 announced pro-russian protesters had been pushed out of its city hall			0
but one of those demonstrators , @entity171 , claimed that an assault on @entity175 by what she said were extreme - right @entity1 failed			0
@entity1 's @entity9 later stated about 30 people armed with baseball bats entered the building early thursday demanding the occupiers			2
as the two groups clashed -- leaving five injured -- police tried to separate them			0
@entity75 : @entity74 ' teed up ' to impose more sanctions this kind of violence is n't what optimists expected over a week ago , after the @entity74 , @entity4 , the @entity195 and @entity1 agreed to a deal that , among other things , called for illegal groups to disarm and vacate occupied buildings in return for amnesty			1
the situation has only deteriorated since then , as has the war of words			0
speaking in @entity201 , @entity74 president @entity75 again ruled out any military solution in @entity1 but warned that the @entity74 is " teed up " to impose further sanctions on @entity4 if it does not abide by the april 17 deal			1
" there was some possibility that @entity4 could take the wiser course after the meetings in @entity209 , " he said			2
" instead , we continue to see militias and armed men taking over buildings , harassing folks who are disagreeing with them , and destabilizing the region , and we have n't seen @entity4 step up and discourage that			2
" @entity80 sounded off against @entity4 later thursday , reeling off what he called positive efforts by @entity1 's government to implement the @entity209 deal while rapping @entity54 for having " refused to take a single concrete step in the right direction			1
" he pointed to " peaceful protesters ... armed with grenade launchers and automatic weapons , " self - defense group members wearing " brand new matching military uniforms and speaking in dialects that every local knows comes from thousands of miles away " and the reported arrests of @entity4 intelligence operatives in @entity1			1
" through its actions and " propaganda , " @entity54 has attempted to undermine " a legitimate political process with the barrel of a gun and the force of a mob that could n't be achieved any other way , " said @entity80			2
" it is clear that only one side , one country , is keeping its word , " he said			0
" ... the world , sadly , has rightly judged that @entity4 has put its faith in distraction , deception and destabilization			1
" but @entity4 sees things differently , saying that according to the international deal , @entity0 must take responsibility for disarming the right - wing ultranationalists that @entity54 blames for violence			1
" we do n't have any doubts that the first step must be done by the @entity0 authorities , " @entity4 foreign minister @entity255 said at a news conference			1
he accused the @entity45 of treating leaders in @entity0 like " angels " while blaming @entity4 for the unrest			1
@entity18 , speaking on @entity4 24 , said the events unfolding in eastern @entity1 demonstrate that @entity54 's decision to support the @entity267 people , who voted to join @entity4 last month in a referendum condemned by the @entity45 , was right			2
" otherwise they would have witnessed the same events as eastern @entity1 and surely even worse , " he said			0
" so , this is another proof that we have acted correctly and on time			0
" @entity255 : @entity74 ' running the show ' in @entity0 ' without any scruples ' how will the @entity1 crisis end ? five possible scenarios @entity279 fighter jets intercept 2 @entity4 bombers in their airspace @entity2 's @entity282 reported from @entity0 ; @entity2 's @entity283 wrote and reported from @entity284 and @entity285 from @entity286			1
@entity2 's @entity287 and @entity288 reported from near @entity16 and @entity289 from @entity0			2
@entity2 's @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 and @entity294 contributed to this report .			0
