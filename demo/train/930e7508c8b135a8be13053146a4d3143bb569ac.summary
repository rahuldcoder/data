@entity0 , @entity1 -- tuesday night , the @entity3 displayed its deep commitment to women 's equality			1
drawing upon her own life story , a story of discrimination shared by too many women across @entity11 , @entity6 delivered a rousing speech as only she can			2
@entity6 , the face of the fight for women 's equality , reminded us all just how far we have come in the last four years			1
she framed fair pay as both an economic and moral issue			1
she reminded us all of president @entity20 's first act in office , the @entity22 , which he signed thinking of his mother , wife and two young daughters			0
@entity6 , a former manager at a tire plant , knows that her family was deprived of thousands of dollars because of discrimination , money that could have been put back into the @entity11 economy			2
as my mother 's son and the brother to two older and wiser sisters , this issue resonates particularly deeply with me			0
equal pay for equal work should not be a controversial issue in the @entity40 , but like the debate over contraception and choice , somehow the @entity41 has reignited a debate that should have ended decades ago			1
just to be clear , my sisters would scoff if my work was ever called equal to theirs			0
in addition , first lady @entity48 reminded @entity11 that her most important title is still " mom in @entity51			0
" she identified herself as yet another mother struggling with the difficulties of parenting who cares more than anything about the country that she will leave to her children			0
@entity48 did not need to shout , " i love you , women " in order to be understood by the women of @entity11 ; her story is their story			1
while women will surely play a crucial role in this election , tuesday night served as a reminder that @entity20 's commitment to women is not political -- it 's personal			2
@entity11 will never succeed if half of its citizens do n't have an ally in the @entity76 .			0
