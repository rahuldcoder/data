@entity0 -- a prominent @entity3 human rights activist has called for an investigation into what he describes as corrupt and cruel officials who he says " violently assaulted " him and his family before he escaped from house arrest and fled to @entity0			1
@entity9 addressed the @entity3 premier , @entity10 , in a video posted on @entity12 on friday , detailing the abuses he said he and his family had suffered at the hands of authorities during more than 18 months of heavily guarded detention in their home			1
" they broke into my house and more than a dozen men assaulted my wife , " he said			2
" they pinned her down and wrapped her in a comforter , beating and kicking her for hours			0
they also similarly violently assaulted me			0
" @entity3 authorities have not commented			0
the activist , who is blind , was driven to @entity0 on sunday after evading his guards in the tiny village of @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity34 , a friend and fellow activist , said friday			1
@entity37 was like a @entity39 thriller his high - profile breakout appears to have angered the local authorities who were holding him captive , with members of his family already reporting that they have suffered reprisals			2
@entity9 , 40 , is a self - taught lawyer who rose to fame in the late 1990s thanks to his legal advocacy for what he called victims of abusive practices , such as alleged forced abortions , by @entity3 's family - planning officials			1
a local court sentenced @entity9 to four years and three months in prison for damaging property , disrupting traffic and " pressurizing the government " in a protest , according to a story from the state - run @entity64 news agency			1
the same 2007 story , which reported that a higher court had denied his appeal , described @entity9 as a " blind mob organizer			1
" his supporters have maintained authorities used trumped - up charges to silence him			0
since his september 2010 release from prison , he had been confined to his home along with his wife , mother and daughter			0
in the video posted friday , he said the treatment of him and his family by the local security forces " was so cruel it has greatly harmed the image of the @entity82			2
" calling on @entity10 to investigate his case , he asked : " is it just local officials flagrantly violating the law or do they have the support of the central government ? i hope you will give the public a clear answer in the near future			1
" the blind activist had prepared for his escape for months , @entity34 said , by lying in bed for prolonged periods so that the guards would n't be suspicious if they did n't see any activity from him for a long time			1
once free , @entity9 contacted @entity34 and a few other activists			2
" we learned that he had escaped and needed our help , " she said , in an interview via @entity104 from her home city of @entity106			0
they met him at a rendezvous point , and then drove him to @entity0 and hid him in a safe house , @entity34 said			2
she said that @entity9 's fellow activists had decided to publicize his flight from captivity after hearing that @entity33 authorities , upon discovering his disappearance , had sent people to assault members of his family			1
@entity119 , the blind activist 's nephew , said in a phone conversation with a @entity3 activist that local officials broke into his family 's home			1
he said he used kitchen knives to defend himself when the officials tried to arrest him			2
" i was afraid they might knock me down unconscious or beat me to death , so i went out to find somewhere safe , " the nephew said in the conversation , a recording of which was posted online			0
he added that he had since called the police and was waiting for them to come and pick him up			0
repeated attempts to reach @entity119 by phone were unsuccessful			0
the blind activist expressed concern in the video about the welfare of his wife , mother and daughter -- who did not escape with him and whose whereabouts were unknown friday			1
" although i 'm free , my worries are only deepening , " he said			0
" my wife , mother and children are still in their evil hands			0
they have been persecuting my family for a long time , and my escape would only prompt them into a mode of revenge			0
" @entity154 @entity156 @entity155 echoed those sentiments , saying in a statement released friday that she is " disturbed to hear reports that other family members ... have now been detailed			1
" noting she has raised concerns about @entity9 's case before , @entity155 urged @entity3 authorities " to investigate the treatment of both him and his family , to ensure their physical integrity and to provide redress for any wrongdoing by local officials			1
" repeated calls seeking comment from the local authorities in @entity33 went unanswered			2
@entity9 is relatively weak physically but his spirits are high , said @entity34			2
there have been concerns about @entity9 's health during his time under house arrest , surrounded by a heavy police presence			1
" he wants to live freely in his own country , " @entity34 said			0
" he said he hopes to hold my hand and take me to his village one day			0
" the authorities ' reaction to @entity9 's escape appeared to have ensnared @entity34 , too , after she spoke to @entity1 and other news media organizations friday to publicize the situation			1
@entity192 , the head of the @entity194 - based nonprofit group @entity193 , said that he was communicating with @entity34 via @entity104 when she said that state security agents had arrived at her home			0
attempts to contact her since then have been unsuccessful			0
she had acknowledged that , by speaking out about @entity9 's escape , she was putting herself at risk			1
" i 'm not concerned about my own safety , " she said during the @entity104 interview			0
" i hope they 'll arrest me , not my friends			0
" @entity9 himself has been a focal point for some time , with journalists and sympathizers being prevented from visiting him			2
they include actor @entity211 , who was roughed up by security guards during such an attempt in december			0
last year , in a video smuggled out of the country by a @entity194 - based human rights group , @entity9 described his dire conditions of being a prisoner in his own home			1
" those people stand at the four corners of my house , spy on my family and monitor what we do , " he said			2
" they installed floodlights and surveillance cameras around my house			0
" @entity9 's incarceration and allegations of abuse by local officials have drawn international criticism from the likes of @entity194 secretary of state @entity235 and @entity236 , the @entity194 ambassador to @entity3			1
@entity237 , a @entity194 - based nongovernmental organization that has been advocating @entity9 's release , urged @entity239 to raise the case when she visits @entity0 next month			1
" we are grateful that @entity9 is no longer under house arrest , but we are concerned about his safety and that of his family , " @entity242 , the organization 's president , said in a statement			1
@entity1 's @entity250 contributed to this report .			0
