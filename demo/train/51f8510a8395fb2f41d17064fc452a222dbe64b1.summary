@entity0 -- delegations from the @entity3 and several @entity5 nations walked out of the @entity6 thursday during @entity9 president @entity8 's speech , in which he repeatedly condemned the @entity3 and said some countries use the @entity11 as an " excuse to pay ransom ... to @entity14			1
" delegates from @entity16 , @entity17 , and the @entity18 were among those who walked out			0
delegations from @entity21 and @entity22 were not present from the beginning			0
in his remarks , @entity8 called the september 11 , 2001 , attacks " mysterious " and said they were a pretext for a @entity3 - led war against @entity28 and @entity29			1
he said the @entity3 killed @entity32 leader @entity31 instead of assigning a fact - finding team to investigate " hidden elements involved in september 11			1
" he also placed blame on the @entity3 for numerous global problems including the financial crisis , criticizing it for dominating the world 's " policy - making establishments , " overspending on the military , and " printing trillions of dollars " that triggered inflation , according to an @entity45 translation of his speech provided by @entity9 's @entity0 mission			1
@entity8 said the @entity3 government views @entity14 as " sacred , " and that " @entity5 countries still use the @entity11 after six decades as the excuse to pay ( a ) fine or ransom to the @entity14			1
" after assailing the @entity3 , @entity8 said " the main question is the quest for the root cause of such attitudes			1
the prime reason should be sought in the beliefs and tendencies of the establishment			0
an assembly of people in contradiction with the inner human instincts and disposition who also have no faith in @entity67 and in the path of the divine prophets , replace their lust for power and materialistic ends with heavenly values			1
to them , only power and wealth prevail , and every attempt must bring into focus these sinister goals			0
" on the eve of the address , the @entity9 president declared his country to be " a new model for life to the world			2
" he also said that the @entity3 might be willing to " hijack " the @entity87 uprisings , according to the @entity9 state - run news agency @entity88 , but did not further explain his assertion			1
@entity8 's appearance at the @entity0 in @entity92 comes a day after two @entity3 hikers , held in an @entity9 prison for more than two years , were released			1
wednesday evening , @entity8 met with a group of @entity3 university students , and then gave an interview to @entity9 satellite television			1
his office provided translated quotes from both			0
the @entity9 leader said " that the world is in need of change , and @entity106 , liberalism , humanism and the @entity109 could not solve man 's problems , " his office said			1
@entity8 added that " relying on its culture and rich civilization , " @entity9 is " the only nation " that " can offer a new model for life to the world			1
" he told the students " that the @entity3 may be willing to hijack the regional uprisings but a stormy movement is under way , " @entity88 reported			1
" elsewhere in his speech , he said that the @entity0 was set up with the objective of preventing bullying in the world , but this did not happen , " @entity88 reported			0
about 100 undergraduate and graduate students , along with some professors , attended the invitation - only dinner and question - and - answer session in @entity92 , moderated by an @entity9 @entity0 official			1
@entity8 did not eat with the guests			2
students who spoke with @entity1 afterward expressed excitement about the event			2
at the end , the guests were given hand - painted plates from @entity9 and books about theology			1
the mood was jovial and positive , people who were there said			0
while some questions were asked about nuclear issues , the economy , and @entity22 , the tone remained positive			0
@entity8 joked and laughed at times			2
participants included students and staff from @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , and other schools			2
strict security measures included the collection of phones and cameras before the event			0
it was described as a very different experience from @entity8 's controversial 2007 appearance at @entity154			1
that year , the school 's president , @entity165 , challenged him on human rights , on his statements questioning whether the @entity11 happened , and on his call for @entity22 to be " wiped off the map " as a jewish state			2
@entity165 told @entity8 he exhibits " all the signs of a petty and cruel dictator			2
" large protests against @entity8 's regime took place surrounding that event			1
the group @entity179 -- whose founders include former cia director @entity182 and the late ambassador @entity183 -- slammed wednesday 's event			2
the participants " should be ashamed of themselves , " said @entity185 , the group 's executive director , describing it as " a propagandistic attempt by the regime to improve its image			0
anyone claiming to support liberty , tolerance , and human rights should strongly oppose a dictator who oppresses women , kills homosexuals , violates his citizens ' basic rights and religious freedoms , and pursues nuclear weapons			0
" @entity8 also gave an interview to @entity206 op - ed columnist @entity205 in which he discussed the dispute over @entity9 's nuclear activities			1
he said that if the @entity3 gives @entity9 20 % enriched uranium , " we will cease the domestic enrichment of uranium of up to 20 % this very week			1
we only want the 20 % enrichment for our domestic consumption			0
if they give it to us according to international law , according to @entity220 laws , without preconditions , we will cease domestic enrichment			0
" the @entity220 -- @entity220 -- is the @entity0 entity that monitors nuclear activity in the world			0
many countries , including the @entity3 , believe @entity9 is trying to create a nuclear weapons program , but @entity227 insists its activities are only to provide energy for the country			1
when asked about the uprising in @entity232 , @entity8 told @entity205 that the @entity232 government , " just like any other country , " should engage in dialogue			1
" with clashes and confrontations problems will not be solved			0
differences will be multiplied and magnified			0
and certainly foreigners must not intervene			0
intervention of foreigners will only make the problem that much bigger , and will never solve it			0
" after the 2009 elections that kept @entity8 in office , @entity9 forces launched a violent crackdown on street protests			1
the 2011 @entity252 human rights report on @entity9 says " scores of protesters and non-protesting bystanders were killed , especially during anti-government rallies			2
government sources reported the death toll at 37 , opposition groups reported approximately 70 individuals died , and human rights organizations suggested as many as 388			0
" @entity8 , in his interview with @entity205 , painted a very different picture			2
" in total there were 33 lives lost , " he said			0
" more than two - thirds of those killed belonged to the security forces and innocent bystanders			2
less than one - third were those who clashed with the security / police forces			0
so they were a very , very small minority			0

new : @entity8 refers to the @entity3 government as having " no faith in @entity67 "
new : @entity8 says the @entity3 killed @entity31 instead of assigning a fact - finding team on the 9 - 11 attacks
@entity8 's *meeting* with university students and faculty wednesday was generally *lighthearted*
his depiction of @entity9 's 2009 crackdown on protests differs from the @entity3 version
