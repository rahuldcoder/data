-- with the two sides unable to come to contract terms , the @entity1 locked out its referees before the preseason began			1
here are some of the issues that are on the table between the @entity1 , its 32 owners and the 121 officials			1
pay the money to pay officials comes from a pot of $ 18 million funded by the league			1
the @entity1 wants an increase in the average salary for officials , who are part - time employees , from $ 149,000 to $ 189,000 by 2018			1
referees ( the head officials ) and officials who qualify for postseason games would make more , the league said			2
the raises each year would fall between 5 % and 11 % , the league said			2
the officials have asked for more , but have not publicly disclosed how much			0
they say the league , which has revenues of more than $ 9 billion per year , can afford it			2
@entity1 : @entity30 should have won retirement plan the league wants to switch from a pension plan to a 401k plan			1
the league said in a july statement : " no game official will lose any vested pension benefit under our proposal and the clubs will fully fund all pension obligations			2
" but the executive director of the referees association said in an open letter to the media last week that plan would transfer long - term investment risk to the officials and would cut the league 's financial obligation by 60 %			1
@entity52 said 18 of the league 's teams have some form of defined - benefit program rather than a 401k system			0
the league said their plan will give the officials a larger retirement benefit			0
the officials have proposed that only new hires be moved to the 401k plan			0
@entity65 : @entity67 firm in negotiations more reserve crews according to @entity71 of @entity65 the league would like to add three crews of seven people in reserve with the option to use these referees to replace underperforming officials			1
that would add 21 officials to the pool and officials fear it would affect their job security			1
referees are only paid for games worked , so anyone who was " benched " would lose pay			0
chorus for @entity1 referees grows full - time officials right now each official works a full - time job and refs in his free time			1
officials also have to watch game tape , file reports to the league office and take a weekly written test on the rules			0
one veteran referee told @entity102 that all that , coupled with keeping in shape , takes 30 hours a week			0
the league wants to hire seven full - time officials and have them handle training and scouting			0
the officials ' association has said it would ok with that , if the referees were paid a fair amount			0
photos : blown calls in sports history			0

there are 121 officials locked out by the @entity1
they *disagree* with league on how much should be added to *compensation* pool each year
the league wants a 401k , officials want to stick with a pension
league wants to add 21 more officials but not everyone would work each week
