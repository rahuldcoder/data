-- have you always been something of a risk - taker , or have you tried to avoid risks like the plague ? do you get uncomfortable with too much optimism or praise , or are you known for your sunny outlook ? the answer to these questions is remarkably simple , but powerful enough to change your life			2
in a nutshell , there are two ways to look at your goals			2
let 's start with a goal many of us share : " doing my job well			2
" for some of us , doing our jobs well is about the potential for advancement , achievement and rewards			0
it 's about what we might gain if we are successful			1
if you are someone who sees your goals this way , you have what 's called a promotion focus			1
for the rest of us , doing our jobs well is about security -- about not losing everything we 've worked so hard for			0
when you are prevention focused , you want to avoid danger , fulfill your responsibilities , and be someone people can count on			1
you want to keep things running smoothly			0

they use different strategies , have different strengths , and are prone to different kinds of mistakes			0
one group will be motivated by applause , the other by criticism			0
one group may give up too soon -- the other may not know when to quit			0
the key to reaching your goals -- at work and everywhere else -- is to identify your focus , and learn to work with it instead of against it			1
there are online assessments you can take to identify your motivational focus , but you can also get a pretty good sense of it by comparing your own behavior to the following descriptions			0
promotion people are creative and innovative , comfortable taking chances , optimistic , speedy workers and good at seizing opportunities			1
the downside is they are also more likely to make mistakes , less likely to have a back - up plan if things go wrong , bad with details , and more likely to take a risk that lands them in hot water			0

the downside is they are also more likely to miss out on great opportunities , get too bogged down with details , and have a tendency to be overly anxious			0
studies show that the way to be most effective in reaching your goals is to use the strategies that match your particular motivation			1
attitude for example when you are promotion - focused , your motivation feels like eagerness			1
so embrace your optimism as confidence heightens your energy and intensity			0
doubting yourself takes the wind right out of your sails			0
when you are prevention - focused , your motivation feels like vigilance -- you are on the lookout for danger			1
@entity111 actually increases in response to negative feedback or self - doubt			0
there 's nothing like the looming possibility of failure to get your prevention juices flowing			2
overconfidence or effusive praise , however , may lead you to let down your guard , and undermine your motivation -- so beware of both			2
decision - making promotion - focused people make the best decisions when they weigh the relative pros of option a and b , when they think about why something is worth doing , and when they trust their instincts			1
the prevention - minded , on the other hand , prefer to weigh the cons of options a and @entity130 , and go with lesser of two evils			2
they make the best decisions when they think about how something could be done , and when they can point to rational reasons , rather than feelings , to justify their choices			0
problem - solving promotion people are also more exploratory and abstract in their thinking			2
so generate lots of options and possibilities when coming up with ways to reach your goals -- be creative , consider alternatives			0
prevention - focused thinking is concrete and specific -- so pick a plan and stick to it			1
prevention people want to drill down to the details , and focus on the nitty - gritty of what needs to be done			2
they are more comfortable with tried - and - true methods rather than " innovative " but untested ones			0
people always want to know if is it better to be promotion or prevention focused			1
the truth is , both kinds of motivation can bring you success , and both have their pitfalls			2
each brings something of value ( e.g. , bold solutions , attention to detail ) to your organization			0
my promotion - focused husband dreams up all of our terrific family vacations , while i take care of the more prevention - focused tasks , like making sure we all have passports			1
so you can be happy and successful at work and in life by focusing on what there is to gain or what there is to lose			1
just remember to play to your strengths and to take with a grain of salt the well - meaning advice and input from others when it does n't feel right for you			0
