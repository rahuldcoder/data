so , now what ? how do those who clogged the streets of @entity5 on wednesday wanting so desperately to oust @entity6 , the now - deposed president of @entity5 , feel about the future now it appears to be wide open ? earlier this week , @entity0 spoke to four protesters about their hopes , demands and expectations , from a veteran demonstrator in @entity14 who has marched in crowds since the beginning of @entity5 's revolution in 2011 to a first - time protester in the port city of @entity20			1
we spoke to them again friday about how they felt when @entity6 was toppled , their thoughts on what should happen next and their concerns for the future of a country they are fighting so hard to change			1
this is what they had to say : @entity33 i was at @entity35 during the announcement of the army 's statement			0
[ the ] square exploded with joy once protesters knew that @entity6 was no longer the president			1
people were singing , chanting , singing and waving @entity5 flags			1
fireworks were all over the square			0
military helicopters flew over the square for hours			0
i was happy that @entity6 was toppled , but i was concerned , too			0
the fact that the army is back on the political scene makes me worry			0
the road map is what we have been calling for since [ former @entity5 president ] @entity55 's ousting			1
i wish @entity6 had called for early presidential elections and saved the whole situation			0
the situation is very complicated and , to be honest , i 'm not sure if the army 's intervention was the right thing to do			0
i would personally prefer that we achieve our goals and demands without any interference from the military			0
there 's a strong debate on whether what happened was a coup or a revolution			0
i think the military sided with the people after [ they ] took to the streets			1
@entity5 prefer to call it a revolution			1
@entity77 opinion : it 's an @entity5 revolution , not a coup those in power [ now ] should stick to the demands of the people			1
they should return @entity5 to civilian rule as soon as possible			2
they should respect human rights and apply the law fairly without any extraordinary measures			0
they should keep the transitional period as short as possible			0
[ the ] people must keep a close watch on those in power and take action if there 's any deviation from their demands and goals			1
@entity101 it was such an interesting day			0
i went to [ @entity35 ] @entity35 around 4 p.m. , as i wanted to see how people would react to the speech			1
people started shaking hands and celebrating after hearing [ the ] news [ of ] @entity6 's ousting			1
i sat down in a corner of the square and observed people celebrating and tried to capture it on camera			2
@entity113 : ' @entity6 's ouster was needed so @entity5 can not fail ' the army acted very quickly to meet the increasing demands of the protesters to protect the country from slipping into violence and civil war between pro- and @entity122 protesters			1
the army ... is very keen to make sure that their interests are protected before the country becomes uncontrollable			2
this army made it clear , by choosing a civilian to lead the interim process ... that the masses of people would not revolt back at the army as before			2
it is sad to see @entity6 destroy the political future of the @entity134 [ @entity136 movement backing @entity6 that rose to power after the fall of @entity55 ] by sticking to power and not allowing a smooth transition			1
the @entity134 has a great grassroots structure that should be utilized to build @entity5			2
those in power now should focus on economic reform to reach the demands of the lower income brackets			2
also , education and gender equality should be a priority to empower youth and women -- two factors any economy depends on to progress			0
@entity154 we have finally relaxed now this bad group [ of rulers ] has finally ended [ their time in power ] -- my wife told me it 's the same feeling you have after cleaning your house			1
all the army 's [ actions ] until now are great , [ they 've not made ] a single mistake			2
they learned a big lesson from january 25 , 2011 , [ when the @entity5 revolution began ]			1
they just protected the people 's demands and put the country on the right track			0
events in @entity5 : what we know so far @entity6 should step back , and face legal matters if there any [ and ] we [ will ] steadily build our country			1
we should write a good constitution that fulfills all @entity5 , [ have ] elections and select a capable government			1
the people can do a lot to support their leaders -- they just need a guide , and the people will do miracles			0
@entity191 i was following the news from home in front of the television and on my laptop on social networks , along with my family			0
when the news was announced -- it was like @entity5 had just won the @entity202 in soccer			2
everyone was happy and my parents cried from joy			0
[ people in ] cars in the street began cheering for the news			1
opinion : get ready for the extremist backlash i 'm one of the people who does not want the army to rule the country , so the interim president is the most suitable solution to avoid having the army ruling			2
nothing should happen to @entity6			0
he should be free to live wherever he wants and however he wants			0
whoever is in power now should prepare fast for presidential elections and complete the transitional period as early as possible			0
the people should observe the progress done [ so far ] -- and protest again if something goes wrong against their will .			1

protesters against former @entity5 president celebrated , now are looking to the future
@entity0 asked protesters who had taken to the streets earlier to follow up on their thoughts
there was concern about violence and *reflection* on what those now in power need to do
" the people ... [ should ] protest again if something goes wrong against their will , " one says
