bold claims for new battery technology have been around since the invention of the lead - acid battery more than 150 years ago			2
but researchers at @entity6 in the @entity7 say their latest discovery involving the new wonder material graphene could be the most revolutionary advance in battery technology yet			1
according to a study published in the journal nature , graphene membranes could be used to sieve hydrogen gas from the atmosphere -- a development that could pave the way for electric generators powered by air			1
" it looks extremely simple and equally promising , " said dr @entity20 , a post-doctoral researcher in the project			0
" because graphene can be produced these days in square metre sheets , we hope that it will find its way to commercial fuel cells sooner rather than later			1
" pencil power at the heart of the technology is the remarkable physical properties of graphene -- a substance with the same atomic structure as the lead found in the humble household pencil			1
isolated in 2004 by a team from @entity6 headed by @entity39 and @entity40 -- both of whom won the @entity42 for their discovery in 2010 -- graphene is already well known as a technological game - changer			1
the first two - dimensional crystal known to science , graphene is the thinnest , lightest and strongest object ever obtained			2
it is harder than diamond and 200 times stronger than steel			1
flexible , transparent and able to conduct electricity even better than copper , the ground - breaking substance is set to revolutionize everything from smartphones and wearable technology to green technology and medicine			2
renowned for its barrier qualities , graphene is just one atom thick - more than a million times thinner than a human hair			1
membrane technology the latest discovery makes graphene attractive for possible uses in proton - conducting membranes which are at the core of modern fuel - cell technology			1
fuel cells work by using oxygen and hydrogen as a fuel , converting the chemical energy produced by its input directly into electricity			1
however , current membranes that separate the protons necessary for this process are relatively inefficient , allowing contamination in the fuel crossover			2
using graphene membranes could boost their efficiency and durability			1
the team found the protons passed through the ultra-thin crystals with relative ease , especially at raised temperatures and with the use of a platinum - based catalyst coated on the membrane film			0
harvesting hydrogen the most surprising aspect of the research , however , found the membranes could be used to extract hydrogen from the atmosphere			1
the scientists said such harvesting could be combined with fuel cells to create a mobile electric generator fueled simply by hydrogen present in air			1
" when you know how it should work , it is a very simple setup			0
you put a hydrogen - containing gas on one side , apply small electric current and collect pure hydrogen on the other side			0
this hydrogen can then be burned in a fuel cell			1
" we worked with small membranes , and the achieved flow of hydrogen is of course tiny so far			0
but this is the initial stage of discovery , and the paper is to make experts aware of the existing prospects			0
to build up and test hydrogen harvesters will require much further effort			0
" currently , hydrogen is obtained nearly entirely from fossil fuels			0
graphene revolution already scientists are finding new ways of processing graphene and new applications for the invisible substance			2
because it is flexible and stretchable , it makes it an ideal candidate for solar generation			0
new research from the @entity140 in @entity141 showed that graphene could be far more efficient in the transformation of light into energy			0
the study found that unlike silicon , which generates only one current - driving electron for each photon it absorbs , graphene can produce multiple electrons			2
although the application of graphene in solar cells is only theoretical , the potential could be staggering			0
solar cells made with graphene could offer 60 % solar cell efficiency -- double the widely - regarded maximum efficiency of silicon cells			1
apart from uses in transportation , where its lightness and strength stands to transform the manufacture of cars and planes to make them more fuel efficient , graphene has been studied as a corrosion - proof coating for packaging and even super-thin condoms			2
in medicine , researchers say it could be used to deliver drugs to specific sites in the body and is being developed as a treatment for people with brain conditions			0
in industry , its use as a membrane is being studied as a means of purifying water and even as a way of extracting salt and other elements from sea water to make it drinkable			0

researchers in the @entity7 say the latest discovery involving wonder material graphene could revolutionize batteries
graphene is 200 times stronger than steel and a million times thinner than a human hair
the material , which has the same atomic structure as the lead in pencils , is *impermeable* to atoms and molecules
scientists found that *positively* *charged* hydrogen atoms could pass through it with implications for fuel cell efficiency
