-- paid family leave , which tops the agenda of monday 's @entity3 , and which was discussed at tuesday 's @entity0 town hall with @entity5 , is a good idea whose time has come -- and gone			1
asked whether paid maternity leave should be mandated by law , @entity8 said " eventually , it should be , but , right now , we 're seeing some -- some very good proposals being implemented in other parts of the country , so that we have answers			1
" efforts to pass paid maternity leave in the @entity19 stretch back to at least 1919			1
in the intervening years , as most other countries have guaranteed income for new mothers taking time off and many have also covered new fathers and those caring for seriously ill family members , we 've learned much about the specific ways paid leave helps babies , parents and entire families			1
so why do n't we have a law requiring paid leave yet ? at virtually every juncture , its benefits have been overshadowed by a single powerful argument : that paid leave is bad for business			1
but is it ? as a journalist and researcher , i set about trying to answer that question over the past year by looking to one of those states that have passed their own paid family leave proposals			1
though there 's no national paid family leave law , three states now provide cash benefits to workers bonding with babies or caring for sick relatives : @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54			1
researchers were already studying employers in @entity52 , where paid family leave has been in place since 2004 , and @entity54 just began its program this year , so i decided to explore businesses ' experiences in @entity53			1
since 2009 , @entity53 has been offering workers caring for seriously ill relatives or new babies up to six weeks of payments that amount to two - thirds of their salary , capped at $ 595 a week			0
the state has granted more than 100,000 family leaves in that time , more than 80 % of which were used to bond with and care for infants , according to the state 's labor department			1
" family leave insurance , " as it 's called , poses no direct costs to businesses , because it 's entirely funded by a small ( up to 60 cents per week ) tax on employees			1
still , there are other ways that the program could be a drag on employers			0
so , with a grant from the @entity85 , i visited as many businesses as i could find where a worker had taken a family leave in the past year and asked if the law had hurt them in any way			1
despite the diversity of the 18 businesses i wound up visiting , which spanned the gamut from shipping to home nursing , pharmaceutical , and accounting , most of the owners or human resources managers i spoke with said the same thing : that paid leave had n't affected how they do business			1
not a single company felt it affected turnover or productivity			0
and while some had feared employees would take advantage of the program -- receiving benefits they were n't due , for example -- no one knew of any instances of abuse actually happening			2
perhaps surprisingly , since some had predicted the law would be so burdensome it would drive businesses from the state , many employers said they actually liked the program			2
when i asked how it had affected their work " all in all , " none responded negatively			0
six saw the law as neutral , while 12 felt it had a positive impact			2
employers seemed most appreciative of the fact that paid family leave decreased their workers ' financial stresses			1
one human resources manager noted that , before the law , employees returning from leaves not infrequently received calls from collection agents in the office			2
since the paid leave law has been in place , she said , the number of those calls has dropped			2
another human resources manager , who worked for a bank , recounted her own contrasting experiences of taking time off to care for her two children -- one born before @entity53 's paid leave program was in place , the other after			2
the first time , money was so tight , " i did n't even drive and put gas in my car , " she said			0
her second leave , during which she received six weeks of pay through the state program , was far less stressful			2
though one might assume that employees would prefer to have income when they 're out dealing with the exigencies of life , the experience of another employer i spoke with confirms the point			2
the company , a health and pharmaceutical firm , also has an office in @entity168 and its employees who work there may choose to file taxes in -- and thus participate in the benefit programs of -- either state			1
the person in charge of family leaves at the firm told me she has fielded several unpleasant calls from those who chose not to file in @entity53			2
as she puts it , " when they find out they ca n't get the benefit in @entity168 , they freak out			0
" though employees have good reason to like paid leave , employers ' financial health since the policy has been in place may be the most important measure of its success -- and i made sure to ask about it			1
most of the companies i interviewed -- 14 of 18 -- felt the program had no effect on their bottom lines			0
two others felt it actually saved them money by sparing them the cost of paid leave they had provided themselves before the state program was in place			0
one vice president at a professional services company explained that , though she 's recently had to hire the occasional temp to cover the work of employees out on family leave , those expenses have been offset by the money saved by not paying workers ' full salaries during those leaves			1
( @entity218 estimates that 12 % of workers in the @entity19 have access to paid family leave through their employers			1
) two employers , however , felt that the relatively new program did wind up costing them			0
though their employees -- indeed , virtually all employees -- occasionally took time off to care for babies and sick relatives before @entity53 's paid family leave program was in place , these companies felt that the availability of wage replacement encouraged more of their employees to take leaves and to stay out longer when they did			1
because some of them hired temps to cover the work of employees who were out , the program led to an increase in those costs			0
interestingly , it was these two employers -- the ones who felt the program hurt their bottom line -- who did the most to obliterate the claim that paid leave is bad for business			0
both were hospitals where many nurses took leaves to care for new babies and ailing relatives			0
though the managers i interviewed felt they may have spent more on temps since the paid leave law has been in place , both felt that the financial burden was worth it			0
" from an organizational standpoint , i 'm not sure it 's made a huge difference , " a human resources manager at one of the hospitals said of the paid family leave program			1
" it has made a difference to the people that use it , though			0
" having overseen many leaves , she is familiar with the situations that lead to needing time off -- not just the arrival of new babies , which are both joyful and stressful , but also the decline of parents , which are primarily taxing			0
she was genuinely pleased to now be able to offer a leave option that does n't add to workers ' financial burdens			0
and her staff seemed to share her enthusiasm			0
" i do n't think it 's until someone really needs it that they realize how valuable it is to them , " she said of paid leave			0
" they are so grateful knowing they can take the time off to be with their loved ones			0
" @entity308 's new @entity307 magazine			0

@entity310 : efforts to ensure family leave in @entity19 go back nearly a century
she says only 12 % of businesses provide family leave , which is standard in other nations
@entity310 says her research found that businesses tend to benefit from family leave programs
@entity310 : employees appreciate the *flexibility* they gain from family leave
