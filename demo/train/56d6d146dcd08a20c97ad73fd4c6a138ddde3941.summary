-- if @entity2 had previewed his inaugural speech before the november election , would he have been able to give it in january ? apparently , our president did not think so			1
from the first days of his re-election campaign until as recently as a month ago , president @entity2 described himself " a pretty practical guy " who is " not driven by some ideological agenda			1
" dispensing with that fiction in his inaugural address , he 's been commended for finally and honestly revealing himself			0
no longer is @entity2 a national @entity15 test in which anyone can see anything			1
he has staked his ground : president @entity2 is an unabashed advocate of the old - fashioned @entity20 left			1
that 's not good news for @entity23 who have trekked with him to the end of an ideological limb			1
@entity2 's inaugural statement displayed " a sweeping liberal vision , " the @entity28 wrote			1
@entity31 headlined it , " @entity34 - throated defense of liberalism since @entity35			2
" historian @entity36 called it " a powerful defense of collective action , of government			0
" @entity42 's " @entity41 , " not known for restraining its lefty enthusiasm , did not disappoint : " liberalism is back ! president @entity2 's inaugural address revealed a liberal vision -- a full - throated defense of progressive policy			1
@entity2 's long - delayed public confession of collectivism was not only a rejection of reaganesque individualism			1
it was a repudiation of @entity49 's @entity23			1
@entity49 's moderation was useful camouflage during the campaign but only to return @entity2 to the @entity59 steps , unburdened by another election , free to reignite " the era of big government			1
" perhaps at this point , we should believe him : @entity2 is @entity65 with a jump shot			1
as @entity68 noted , his liberalism was " on full display			0
" his duplicity was , as well			0
@entity2 's post-partisan pragmatism , he has confirmed with his inaugural address , was only a useful political contrivance			1
blinded by the nobility of his intentions , this president has grown comfortable with deception			2
he does what is best for the @entity20 people , even when it requires that he misleads them			0
@entity2 's approach has become the cynical politics he supposedly came to @entity84 to change			1
@entity85 : @entity2 , think big for @entity86 in his forceful january speech , @entity2 trumpeted his mission			1
it is not to leave office as @entity91 , who renewed a failing economy and restored our nation 's confidence			0
@entity2 's calling is a moral one			1
the worst recession since the great depression will have to wait			0
his mission , inherited from @entity101 and @entity102 , is equality , not revitalization			0
yet even as he prepares for tuesday 's @entity86 address , @entity2 twists and stretches			1
what he wants is what we need , he tells us			0
redistribution 's side effect , he pledges , will be a more prosperous @entity20			0
" our economy succeeds and our economy grows , " he says , " when everybody is getting a fair shot and everybody is getting a fair - shake and everybody is playing by the same rules			2
because i believe that is a growth agenda -- not just an equity agenda , not just a fairness agenda -- that is a growth agenda			0
" as he drives , he pits the destitute passengers in his car against the rich , hispanics against @entity125 , women against men , telling them inequality is their worry			0
they fight and claw , unaware they are speeding towards a precipice , oblivious to the common danger that makes their differences pale			0
as long as this president has a @entity139 @entity138 and a veto pen , there will be no deficit reduction , no serious control of entitlements			1
a government we can not afford is not @entity2 's problem			1
why would @entity2 reduce entitlements that redistribute wealth when they force the social change he sees as his legacy ? redistributing wealth , not creating it , is @entity2 's signal intent			1
@entity139 administrations in our largest cities and states -- from @entity160 to @entity84 , @entity84 , from @entity161 to @entity2 's home state of @entity163 -- have tested this president 's old social justice agenda			1
it has produced a record of relentless economic failure			0
yet for this liberal man , economic malaise may just be the price of social justice			2
and the shock , in my mind , is not his commitment to compulsory redistribution , but that a leader so young has such old ideas			0
he is a man from @entity20 's past			0
@entity2 is old - school			1
he believes in top - down planning , not bottom - up incentives			2
he sees government as an industrial machine , though he lives in the age of the network			0
he trusts political and artificial imperatives from @entity84 , not natural and organic choices by ordinary @entity190			0
his answer to irresponsive , ineffective , unaffordable old government is not reform , but to produce more of it			0
@entity2 's bright young smile cloaks archaic ideas , ill - suited for today 's global economic race			1
we have been on this road before			0
we know where it takes us : 1			0
@entity2 will leave office a hero			1
he will leave his party a wreck			0
@entity2 has calculated he will never get on @entity205 working with @entity206 in @entity207 to fix a broken economy			1
their prescriptions and his are incompatible			0
in the president 's view , growth requires money for expansive new government programs			2
he knows he will never get that money from the @entity216 's who run the @entity217			1
his moral vision , however , is a bargain : it requires no funding			2
from @entity101 , to @entity102 , to @entity2 : in this noble cause , not the struggle for economic renewal , he will shape how he 's remembered			1
his legacy will be the @entity226 , not a better one			0
his party will not share his good fortune			0
in @entity2 's first term , in 2010 , he ignored the nation 's economic crisis , moved left , and gave @entity190 health equality			1
@entity2 is now replicating that pattern			2
when this charismatic leader leaves town , he will have returned the @entity139 to its @entity239 past , leaving it wedded to old , slow , big , dumb , inflexible @entity242 government			0
he will leave behind a party that embodies economic stagnation , shackled to the challenges it ignored , and mistrusted with @entity20 's checkbook			0
@entity23 have crawled out on a fragile , ideological limb with @entity2 , a branch loaded with debt and the burden of a sagging economy			1
it will snap long before they find another @entity49 to move their party back to the center , where they can safely renew themselves and rebuild			2
democrats he will leave behind should strap on their life preservers : your president 's interests and yours have diverged			2
look at the @entity206 @entity264 left behind after serving two terms			0
@entity2 's supporters believe otherwise			2
they trust their new left - tilting majority will be sustained by an " emergent @entity139 coalition , " a confederacy of liberals , unions , government workers , black and @entity190 , supplemented by young , single @entity273			2
they may be right : unless @entity206 wake up and provide a palatable alternative , even a mistrusted , out - of - date , ideologically extreme @entity139 will have no effective opposition			2
only when republicans move beyond " no " and offer an optimistic agenda of bottom - up growth and prosperity for all @entity190 , can they emerge from their visionless wandering			2
are @entity206 tired enough of losing to begin to rejuvenate themselves ? @entity283 will not just give the response to president @entity2 's @entity86 address tuesday night ; he will give the nation its first glimpse of an alternative to the antiquated , top - down @entity139 @entity2 will leave us			1
tuesday night , we 'll see the future			0
let the best party and @entity20 win			0
