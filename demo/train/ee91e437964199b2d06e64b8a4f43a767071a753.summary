" i believe it 's in their best interests to vote no , " @entity0 said saturday , speaking to reporters after a team practice			1
" with the research that i 've done , i 'm going to stick to the facts and i 'm going to do everything in my power to educate our guys			0
our university is going to do that , to give them all the resources that they need to get the facts			0
" two of the team 's most visible players , quarterback @entity26 and running back @entity29 , backed their coach			1
" i think at this university i 'm really fortunate to be in the position i 'm in			0
i do n't think union is the answer for my team , or my university , " @entity26 said			0
" i 've been treated unbelievably , far exceeding my expectations			0
" @entity26 thinks a push to unionize may hurt their no. 1 goal , which is to win a @entity42 championship			2
" i just hope the @entity43 does understand some things do need to change , " @entity29 said			0
" but we do not need a third party to come in between us and the coaches , " he said			0
last month , the @entity49 office in @entity50 ruled that players are employees of the school and have the right to unionize after former quarterback @entity54 testified about the rigorous demands of being a @entity57 football player			1
read the board 's ruling ( @entity60 ) the board 's decision indicates that there was enough evidence presented that the athletes are employees of the university -- getting paid in the form of scholarships , working between 20 and 50 hours per week and generating millions of dollars for their institutions			1
the athletes have said they 're seeking better medical coverage , concussion testing , four - year scholarships and the possibility of being paid			0
@entity1 is appealing the ruling to the national @entity49 office			1
the university is sticking to the century - old collegiate athletics stance : that student - athletes are not university employees but " students , first and foremost			0
" " @entity1 considers its students who participate in @entity57 sports , including those who receive athletic scholarships , to be students , first and foremost , " @entity82 , vice president for university relations , said in a statement last month			1
" we believe that participation in athletic events is part of the overall educational experience for those students , not a separate activity			0
" @entity96 , a labor law professor at @entity97 , said the ruling has " vast implications for the structure of the sport , if upheld			0
" but he noted an appeal would likely take years to resolve			2
the @entity43 said that while it was n't party to the proceeding , it was " disappointed " with the board 's ruling and disagreed " with the notion that student - athletes are employees			2
" @entity43 president @entity109 criticized the idea of unionization in a news conference sunday			2
" to be perfectly frank , the notion of using a union employee model to address the challenges that do exist in intercollegiate athletics is something that strikes most people as a grossly inappropriate solution to the problems , " @entity109 said			0
" it would blow up everything about the collegiate model of athletics			0
" on saturday , @entity0 spoke about his experience at @entity1 , covering 18 years , to make his case			1
" right now , we have great protocols in place , and we have n't been forced to do that by any third party , " @entity0 said			1
" i know our guys trust me			0
" he said he had always been an advocate of change for student - athletes , if it had a positive impact			0
" we have to educate them to help them understand the whole aspect of what this decision is ... that 's what their parents entrusted us to do ... and we 'll continue to work with them to do that , " @entity0 said			1
thursday , while speaking at the @entity147 about his efforts to unionize , @entity54 addressed the dissent on the team			2
" i think it 's tough when you have some criticism that they 've got			2
some people came down , hollered on , and even people within the @entity1 alumni base			1
that 's obviously tough , but i think they are strong and they still believe in the issue , " @entity54 said			2
@entity162 , who as head of the @entity164 is a driving force behind the move to unionize , could n't be reached for comment			2
he has said the @entity50 @entity49 ruling would have national implications , but he would n't talk about whether teams at other schools were planning to hold union votes as well .			1
