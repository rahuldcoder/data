-- a single mother who chose taking care of her infant over deploying to @entity5 has been discharged , the @entity1 said in a statement			1
when her unit deployed to @entity5 in november , @entity7 was missing from the plane			0
her lawyer said she refused to go because there was no one to take care of her then 10 - month - old son , @entity14 , and she feared he would be placed in foster care			2
but the @entity1 contended that the young mother and now former @entity1 specialist had plenty of time to sort out family issues and said she could face court - martial			1
the issue was resolved this week , the @entity1 said in a statement thursday from @entity25 in @entity26 , where @entity7 was training			2
" the soldier will not be tried by court - martial and therefore is not at risk of receiving a federal conviction , " the statement said			1
" she is , however , reduced to the lowest enlisted rank , private , and subject to losing other military benefits from the @entity1 and the @entity35 to which soldiers who serve honorably are entitled			0
" before shipping overseas , every soldier must sign military form d - a 53 - 05 , which states that failure to maintain a family care plan could result in disciplinary action			0
@entity7 's attorney , @entity43 @entity42 , said the soldier informed the @entity1 that her family care plan had fallen through and that there was no one to take care of her son			1
she was granted a 30 - day extension to deal with the issue but still was not ready to deploy after the extension had expired , the @entity1 said			2
" the investigation revealed evidence , from both other soldiers and from @entity57 herself , that she did n't intend to deploy to @entity5 with her unit and deliberately sought ways out of the deployment , " the @entity1 statement said			0
@entity7 could not be immediately reached for comment .			0
