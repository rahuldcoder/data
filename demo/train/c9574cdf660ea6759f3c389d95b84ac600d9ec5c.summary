@entity0 -- monday through saturday @entity2 holds court at the @entity4 on @entity5			1
there , amid the whirring fans and tv soaps , he greets clients , many he 's known for decades			1
cutting hair is a family trade , one he took up after serving in the @entity14			0
it puts food on the table , he says , but more important , it affords @entity2 the opportunity to visit with people			0
in between clients , he sits reading the paper , looking up to share words with passers - by			1
it was one among many businesses run by @entity28 , for african - americans , along @entity5			1
during the period of segregation this street was called the " richest @entity34 street in the world			2
" the street existed because of the bleak realities of segregation , but in those days the corridor had a vibrant feel			2
" this was a street full of people on friday and saturday nights			0
if you were in a car it would take you perhaps 15 or 20 minutes to go a block , " recalls @entity44 , a small - business owner on @entity5			1
when @entity44 first arrived in @entity0 in the 1960s he made a beeline for the street			1
he had his first meal on @entity53 , resided on the street , and when he graduated from college in 1970s , he decided to open his insurance business there			1
but by that time , change had already arrived on @entity53			1
@entity44 recalls telling a friend about his decision to open up shop there			0
" he said why do you want to go to @entity5 ? he said the city has integrated			1
he said we 've all left			0
" before integration , @entity44 says , @entity53 was a city unto itself			1
african - americans would come here for doctor 's appointments , they 'd come for entertainment , they 'd come for banking and to start large construction projects			1
when integration came , @entity28 - @entity76 businesses spread throughout the city and the corridor lost much of its vibrancy			1
this year , for the second time , the @entity81 was listed as endangered by the @entity82 , a private nonprofit organization			1
this designation does not mean automatic funding for improvements , but the group says the attention often galvanizes efforts at preservation			0
@entity5 's designation is somewhat unusual , because sites normally are n't listed more than once			1
since the initial designation , residential options have improved on the corridor , the group said , but " the commercial area concentrated on @entity5 has not fared as well			1
" the concern is that without greater resources devoted to planning and preservation , many buildings could be lost along with the history they hold			2
along the corridor , news of the designation passed with mostly tepid curiosity			0
about a half - dozen local business owners @entity1 spoke to expressed surprise about the news but remained hopeful			1
many spoke about recent positive changes they 've seen , like a streetcar project that 's breaking ground with federal funds , and wondered whether the designation might spur more positive changes			2
councilman @entity117 , who represents this district , has taken the news quite seriously			0
@entity117 , whose parents were civil rights leaders , spent many days on @entity53 as a child			1
" there 's a very rich treasure in terms of @entity127 , " @entity117 said , rattling off a long list of buildings and their historical significance			2
for @entity129 the endangered designation necessitates a big response			2
he calls it a " @entity136 " : a concept to revitalize the community by bringing all the disparate interests on board			0
but @entity117 is not @entity137			0
" it 's not easy to move multiple entities , all who have their own boards and organizational goals that are sometimes in conflict , " he said			2
@entity117 is well aware that for historic preservation to get buy - in from existing landowners , there must be a clear incentive for everyone			1
up and down the street that message is well - received			2
owners of new and old businesses alike stressed the need to respect history but not to let it get in the way of progress			2
@entity158 , who owns @entity159 with his mother , said they 'd moved to the street five years ago because of the history			2
the bakery routinely gets tourists wandering down from the @entity165 , a major point of pride for the business that turns out muffins and sweet potato cheesecake			2
also nearby are the home were @entity172 was born and @entity173 , where he was pastor			0
still , doing business on this street has drawbacks			0
@entity158 shoos away a woman asking for change as he squints out the window looking at the ruins of a building across the street			0
" they 've already torn down some buildings , " he says , " and i understand why they want to save some , but some of them are eyesores			0
" around the corner from @entity158 's bakery , a lush green garden provides a vivid picture of how the legacy of this corridor can live on even with radical change			0
@entity197 and @entity198 run the space here known as @entity201 , and turn out beautiful organic produce			0
the small but productive farm bustles with activity			0
there 's a summer camp here and the garden just got funding from the @entity76 @entity210 to train urban farmers			1
@entity198 pauses from a lesson in harvesting to explain how their work fits in with the area 's history			1
" every human definitely deserves to eat good food , so it is absolutely in that lineage of human rights issues , " he says			0
this view is reinforced by the landscape			0
beyond the rows of peppers and sunflowers , historic buildings peek out , buildings that keep @entity198 focused on his mission of spreading social justice through good food			0
despite the visible challenges on this street -- the empty storefronts and a handful of rundown buildings -- @entity117 says he thinks this is actually a good time for @entity53			1
it 's a view shared by many who work on the street every day			0
right now , federal dollars are flowing in for the streetcar project , and many see the future for this street with the neighboring @entity246 continuing to expand its downtown footprint			0
@entity117 says now is the time to move forward with new projects while keeping alive the memories of this street 's role during segregation , and its famous residents ' roles in ending it			1
@entity257 and @entity258 and @entity1 's @entity259 and @entity260 contributed to this report .			0
