-- it could be the worst mass poisoning in history			1
and the terrible irony is that it may all be due to an idealistic push to clean up drinking water for some of the world 's poorest people			0
a new study published in @entity11 medical journal @entity12 says that up to 77 million people in @entity14 are being exposed to toxic levels of arsenic , potentially taking years or decades off their lives			1
an international team of researchers from @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity14 followed 12,000 people over the past decade , monitoring their arsenic intake and mortality rates from contaminated wells			1
by the end of the study , one in five deaths were determined to be directly related to elevated arsenic levels in their system			0
stretch that over the entire population that takes its water from wells , and the impact is daunting			2
the problem has been known about for years , if not the overall deadly impact			2
as far back as a decade ago , the @entity37 called it " the largest mass poisoning of a population in history ... beyond the accidents at @entity43 , @entity44 , in 1984 , and @entity45 , @entity46 , in 1986			1
" well - meaning development groups had encouraged remote villages across @entity14 to dig wells over the past decades , rather than rely on potentially contaminated surface water and dirty rivers			1
but now potentially a much worse problem has been found far below the surface			2
arsenic is a deadly poison with a history of use in intrigue and assassination			0
some have even theorized that @entity61 succumbed to long term poisoning with the substance by his enemies while in exile on the island of @entity67			0
but the element and its derivatives are also used in many industries , such as metal smelting and as a component in products ranging from insecticide to micro-chips			0
and unfortunately , it is also found in abundance in the soil and rock in @entity14			1
it 's leached up through the water table in tens of millions of water wells across the country			2
the study showed that the top quarter of those exposed had a 70 percent higher mortality rate than would be expected in the population as a whole			0
the authors hope for more study , and a long term plan to deal with the damage already done			0
but a solution for those already poisoned may remain decades away			0
other long term health studies have shown it takes 20 years for the negative morbidity effects of arsenic poisoning to dissipate , even after they stopped using contaminated wells .			1
