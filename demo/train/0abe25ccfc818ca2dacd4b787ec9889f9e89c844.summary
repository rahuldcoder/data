-- there 's good and bad news regarding @entity4 ' new novel , " suspect			1
" first , the bad : there 's no sign of uber - popular , crime - fighting duo , @entity9 and @entity10			1
now the good : there is a dog			1
scuttling his most popular characters is a risky move for the award - winning @entity4			1
after all , 15 of his 18 previous novels featured fan favorites @entity9 and @entity10 , including " taken , " his most recent , which hit no. 1 on the @entity24 best - seller list			1
before fervent fans complain , consider that the star of " suspect " is n't just any animal			0
@entity4 has created a unique , endearing canine crime fighter that steals every scene she 's in			1
@entity34 cop @entity33 barely survives a high - powered shootout with a mysterious criminal gang			1
@entity33 is left broken , both physically and mentally			0
worse , he blames himself for his partner 's death			0
now unfit for duty as a patrol officer , he moves to the @entity43 canine unit , where he is paired with a @entity45 shepherd named @entity46			1
like @entity33 , @entity46 is on the mend			0
she served three tours of duty in @entity50 and @entity51 , using her powerful sense of smell to sniff out explosives , before losing her handler to a bomb blast			0
both man and dog are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder			2
together this pair of wounded warriors must help heal each other , while searching for clues in a last - chance case that could be their salvation or their untimely end			1
like all of @entity4 ' work , " suspect " is an intense , fast - paced and thrilling page turner			1
he 's winning raves from critics and has even made a fan out of the editor at @entity77 magazine , @entity78 , who says , " the power of the human - animal bond , and the amazing ways that dogs comprehend our world , have never been better portrayed			1
" @entity0 recently spoke to the author from his @entity34 home about his latest book as well as old dogs and new tricks			2
the following is an edited transcript : @entity0 : what was the spark behind your new novel ? @entity4 : i had a big @entity98 , @entity99 , who was fabulous			1
we lost him when he was 12 , and i 've never been able to replace him			0
normally , most people lose a pet and get another and keep going on			0
but it just felt wrong to me ; it felt disloyal			0
that was 15 years ago			0
i 've been thinking more and more about him recently			0
that connection caused me to start doing research into the whole human - dog relationship			1
through that i became aware of and interested in military - working dogs			1
i learned about the super-intimate connection between these dogs and their canine handlers			2
in many cases , when they 're deployed , the handler and dog literally spend 24 hours a day together			2
they eat together and sleep together because of the nature of their job			0
it 's a bond unlike any other human - canine bond			2
i encountered stories where a handler would be injured or killed , and the dog would be so protective and defensive of the handler , even though the person might be dead or seriously wounded , that the dog would n't even let our guys who were trying to help approach , because the dog and handler are a pack			1
i started reading every book that was available on how dogs think , how they perceive the world , the nature of the relationship between man and dog			1
it was a world that simply swallowed me because i found it so fascinating and interesting			1
@entity0 : you also spent time with police dogs ? @entity4 : from military - working dogs , i got involved and educated in police canine units , which are different but in many ways the same thing because the human handler and the dog are partners			1
i went out with the @entity43 canine units			0
the dogs are amazing and to talk with these guys , to see them work with their dogs really informed the book			2
it was a whole new world for me			2
i think most @entity169 families probably have a dog , but i do n't think people really realize or understand just how wonderful and special dogs are			1
the more i learned about the co-dependency between man and dog and how deep that relationship can be , not in an anthropomorphized way but in a genuine and real way			2
i found it so beautiful , so moving and special that i just had to write about it			2
scenes were just popping out of my head			0
with this particular book it was probably the most emotional that i 've written out of my 19 novels			0
it was a book that i absolutely attacked because i felt so passionate about the subject matter			0
@entity0 : part of " suspect " is told through @entity46 's eyes			0
was it difficult to write from a dog 's point of view ? @entity4 : actually , no. i guess i should say yes , but surprisingly it was n't			1
i had read so many different books and articles on how dogs perceive the world -- their sense of smell , how dogs think , why dogs do what they do -- that when i finally was writing from @entity46 's point of view it came very naturally			1
it was easy for me to imagine how in fact a dog does perceive what 's going on around her			2
i found it a very , very natural thing to write			2
i fell in love with @entity46			0
i tried to make her as real as possible			0
@entity46 is n't a cartoon dog			2
she does n't think the way we think			0
i wanted her to represent for real how dogs perceive us and the world around them			1
@entity0 : in " suspect , " @entity33 and @entity46 both suffer from @entity220 , but i did n't know that affected dogs ? @entity4 : when i was doing the research , i learned about military - working dogs suffering from canine ptsd			1
until that point , i was n't aware that military dogs or police canines or any animal can suffer from @entity220 , just like any person			1
quite a few of the dogs that come back from @entity51 or @entity50 or police dogs that are involved in violent confrontations where there 's gunfire can in fact exhibit the symptoms and suffer from ptsd			1
at @entity237 , they make an effort to retrain military dogs that suffer from ptsd			1
it 's a lengthy , long process			0
the treatment is much the same as it would be for people , but it 's a difficult road back			0
it seemed to me that a dog like @entity46 would certainly suffer from ptsd and ditto her handler @entity33			1
these two characters , they needed each other			2
she can help him heal ; he can help her heal			2
i really wanted to explore what they 're going through together			0
@entity0 : so after this are you ready for another dog ? @entity4 : in a wonderful way i think the immersion that i went through with this book has been very healing			1
it 's much easier for me now to imagine sharing my life with another dog			0
maybe another @entity99 , maybe a @entity45 shepherd , but i can see that happening again now			0
all i have to do is convince my wife			0
@entity0 : what 's next ? will @entity9 and @entity10 return in your next book ? @entity4 : i think the next project is going to be an @entity9 and @entity10 book			1
i will probably bring back @entity269 , too			0
i ca n't say these things definitively because i have this horrible habit of falling in love with my characters , and even though " suspect " was written as a standalone book , i keep wondering if i can come up with a story where @entity33 and @entity46 somehow have to get involved with @entity9 and @entity10			0
if i can bring their two worlds together , that might be fun for me to write and fun for my fans to read			0
i just have to come up with the right story			0
read an excerpt from " suspect			0

in @entity4 ' new novel , a pair of wounded warriors heal each other
both main characters -- a *longtime* police officer and a war dog -- have ptsd
@entity4 says he found the world of military - and police - working dogs eye - opening
