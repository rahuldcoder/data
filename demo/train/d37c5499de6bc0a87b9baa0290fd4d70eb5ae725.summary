-- @entity1 had screwed up			0
in the early ' 60s , when he was a struggling actor , he 'd had a big , emotional scene in the tv drama " @entity4			0
" by his own account , he fell short			0
he wanted to apologize to the casting director who 'd helped him get the role , @entity8			1
he imagined talking to her			0
he was embarrassed by the performance			0
" i was so bad , i got almost physically sick watching it , " he recalls in a new documentary , " @entity13			1
" several years later , he desperately wanted the lead role in a new @entity17 film , " @entity18			1
" but the casting director for " @entity18 " was @entity8			1
@entity1 flew to @entity20 to meet with her			1
he showed up at her door and abjectly apologized			0
but @entity8 , always openhearted , was having none of it			2
" @entity1 , that 's the past , " he remembered her saying			2
" how would you like to meet @entity17 ? " @entity1 was nominated for an @entity29 for the film , which was named 1969 's best picture , and he was on his way			2
that 's just one of many stories about the gracious and shrewd @entity8 , a casting pioneer , shared in " @entity13			1
" the documentary about casting directors , which celebrates the contributions of this most neglected of @entity41 occupations , is scheduled to air on @entity42 monday night			1
@entity8 , whose five - decade career started in tv 's early days , gets particular attention			1
she is credited with revolutionizing the movie business by hiring many of the talents she saw in the @entity20 acting world -- people such as @entity1 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			1
her rise fortuitously coincided with the decline of the studio system , which swept away the contract players who were slotted into movies like so many items from a @entity65 menu			0
she was also a mentor to a number of future casting directors , including @entity68 ( who has done more than three dozen films with @entity70 , as well as " @entity74 , " " working girl " and " network " ) and @entity71 ( " @entity77 , " " @entity78 " and several @entity73 pictures )			1
" ( doing the movie ) opened a window for me into this world of casting that i 'd never really been conscious of before , " says " @entity13 " director @entity79 in a phone interview			1
" i did n't really understand the contributions of the casting director and how important they are creatively			1
" ' everybody thinks they know how to cast ' he is n't the only one			0
though casting can make or break a movie , the job is often overlooked -- certainly by moviegoers , who may not be aware of the long process it takes to find the right actors for the right roles , and even by the movie business itself			1
indeed , the casting director 's film credit is " casting by " because the @entity101 long prevented anyone else from being called a " director " on a movie			1
( the rule has been relaxed for cinematographers , often called " directors of photography , " and art directors			2
) " it 's not something that most people understand , " says @entity113 , a veteran casting director whose credits include " @entity115 , " " @entity116 " and " @entity117			1
" ( one of her former assistants , @entity118 , was a producer on " @entity13			2
" ) " there 's a tendency in casting , because people know who actors are , that almost everybody thinks they know how to cast			1
" casting , she says , means going through countless reels , submissions and auditions in search of filling movie roles ; getting to know actors ' representatives and schedules ; establishing a rapport with the director ; and , these days more than ever , being able to negotiate a @entity41 system in which many people have a stake in a movie 's financial , as well as artistic , success			1
" there 's a lot of micromanagement and a lot of committee involvement , " says @entity145			2
" it 's harder than ever to get actors cast			2
" it 's a conundrum : producers may want an established name , while casting directors may see an unknown with real potential -- an unknown who wo n't get a chance until he becomes , well , an established name			1
and yet , she says , the job has real rewards -- particularly when those unknowns break through			0
it was a thrill @entity8 knew over and over , with her string of @entity20 - trained performers			1
( her secret ? " gut reaction , " she says in the film			2
) @entity145 , too , has given some actors their breakout roles , including @entity174 ( " @entity117 " ) and @entity175 ( " @entity176 " )			2
when " @entity176 " came along , @entity177 -- now known as " @entity179 's " capt. @entity178 -- was ready to go back to @entity20 after hacking around @entity41 for the occasional tv guest spot , says @entity145			1
" i was very taken with him , and i brought him in for ( director ) @entity183 and he was terrific , " she recalls			0
" but the thing with @entity175 was he 'd never done a movie and nobody knew him			0
i think people were a little nervous			0
but i really believed in him , and i made a really good case for him , and he got the part			0
" ' inside , @entity191 is short and @entity192 ' casting is often inspired , a wonderful bit of serendipity			0
" there 's something magic in finding the right person for a part , " says @entity145			0
there are any number of examples			0
@entity57 was supposed to play @entity203 in " @entity204 , " but thought he was more appropriate for @entity205 -- and @entity8 backed him up			2
" @entity13 's " @entity79 says @entity206 was actually considered for the lead in 1978 's " @entity208 , " but @entity209 -- another casting pioneer -- believed the role would be better served with an unknown , and went to bat for @entity213			1
and , in a classic bit of casting , @entity54 got the role of @entity191 in " @entity191			2
" in @entity219 's novel , @entity217 is an athletic , upper - class wasp -- someone who looks like @entity57 , who was actually considered for the role -- but @entity209 and director @entity223 were looking for someone who could project the character 's insecurity			1
in a " @entity13 " clip , @entity54 remembers his uncertainty			2
" i said to @entity229 , i did not think i was right for the role			0
( @entity217 is ) kind of @entity232 , tall , slender , good - looking , " @entity54 recalled			0
" and he said , ' you 're @entity192			0
' i said , ' that 's right -- short and @entity192			0
' he said , ' well , inside , @entity191 is short and @entity192			0
' " despite their key role in shaping movies , casting directors still do n't get all the credit they deserve			1
that was literal in the beginning : @entity209 was the first casting director to get " single - card credit " ( in which the person is the only credit listed on the screen ) , for 1968 's " the @entity246			1
" even today , there 's still some resistance			0
despite attempts to get the position recognized for @entity29 consideration , the motion picture academy has yet to do so			0
( moreover , when colleagues pushed @entity8 for honorary @entity29 recognition , that attempt , too , failed			2
) nevertheless , the actors have remembered			0
one of the pleasures of " @entity13 " is watching performers who have long since gone on to fame and fortune become their younger selves -- telling stories about being hard - up for rent , scrapping for food , wondering about their next job , and then being blessed by a casting director 's wand			1
@entity145 , who 's been in casting for more than 30 years , says the idea of making and breaking careers does n't enter her mind , however			2
she simply believes in what she does			0
" i love talent , " she says			0
" the business has changed so much , but at the very core of it , my love of talent and helping them get the opportunity to work has not changed			0
" @entity8 , who died in 2011 , felt the same way -- and the feeling was reciprocal : " @entity13 " ends with a chorus of tributes from colleagues			1
she may not have been well - known , but @entity1 pays her a great compliment -- one due to so many casting directors			1
" she could see what people could n't see , " he says .			0

" @entity13 " celebrates casting directors , especially pioneer @entity8
@entity8 *reshaped* business by casting @entity20 actors
casting director 's role often overlooked , but it 's key in shaping film
