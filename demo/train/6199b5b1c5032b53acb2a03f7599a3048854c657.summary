guns do n't make a nation safer			2
that 's the conclusion of a study that found a strong correlation between gun ownership rates and the risk of death by firearms in more than a dozen developed countries			1
the @entity10 and @entity11 were on opposite extremes of the scale of gun ownership , with 88.8 guns per 100 @entity10 and 0.6 guns per 100 @entity11			1
they were also on opposite extremes for firearm - related deaths -- 10.2 deaths per 100,000 people in the @entity10 versus 0.06 per 100,000 in @entity11			1
@entity23 's death rate was also low , at 0.25 per 100,000			0
" this argues against the notion of more guns translating into less crime , " said dr. @entity24 , a cardiologist and director of the cardiovascular outcomes group at @entity27 , the lead author of the study			2
the study was based on data from the @entity36			0
the sole outlier was @entity38 , which had 12.7 guns per 100 residents but nearly the same firearm fatality rate -- 9.41 per 100,000 residents -- as seen in the @entity10			1
the other countries were @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity38 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			1
the study , published in the current issue of @entity69 , also correlated the incidence of mental illness with crime rates in each of the countries and found a weaker , but still significant , association			2
( crime rate data were obtained from the @entity76			0
) " the gun ownership rate was a strong and independent predictor of firearm - related death , whereas the predictive power of mental illness burden was of borderline significance , " the investigators concluded			1
" regardless of exact cause and effect , the current study debunks the widely quoted hypothesis that guns make a nation safer			2
" @entity24 noted that his study looked only at correlations			0
but a sharp reduction in gun deaths in @entity44 after its gun ownership laws were tightened proved a cause - and - effect relationship there , he said			1
" i think it 's reasonable to expand it to the @entity10 , " he added			2
still , @entity24 said he would not go so far as to recommend changes , based on his work , in gun ownership laws			1
" we prefer not to go too political into this , but the evidence shows guns do n't make the nation safer , and mental illness is also a contributing factor , " he said in a telephone interview			0
" so something needs to be done			0
it is up to legislators and people who make policies to decide what that should be			0
" shootings in @entity118 , @entity119 ; @entity120 , @entity121 ; @entity122 , @entity123 ; and at @entity124 spurred them to look for a relationship between mental illness and access to guns			0
the @entity130 did not immediately respond to a request for reaction .			0

the @entity10 and @entity11 are on opposite extremes of gun ownership rates
they *'re* also on opposite extremes for firearm - related deaths
@entity38 was the sole outlier in the 27 - nation study
