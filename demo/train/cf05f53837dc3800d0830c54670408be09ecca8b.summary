-- " it 's tough to make predictions , especially about the future " is an aphorism attributed to the great baseball player @entity1			2
but one topic where pundits , politicians and prognosticators of every persuasion do n't have any problem about making pessimistic predictions is terrorism			2
the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , was an @entity18 - level example of this			0
in the lead - up to the @entity22 , the airwaves were filled with glum predictions that @entity15 would be the @entity24 on steroids			1
rep. @entity26 , @entity27 , chairman of the @entity29 @entity28 , told @entity30 , " there 's a high degree of probability that something will detonate , something will go off			1
... but i do think it 's probably , most likely going to happen outside the ' ring of steel ' at the @entity39			0
" similarly , @entity40 , co-chair of the @entity41 , issued a press release headlined , " @entity43 can not become a @entity44			1
" the @entity46 @entity45 warned , " we can not sweep these threats under the rug , like we did with @entity44 or the warnings from @entity16 on the @entity51 brother behind the @entity52			0
each time we fail to recognize these threats , we not only risk the lives of innocent @entity29 , but appear weaker and vulnerable in the eyes of the enemy			1
" @entity57 , who directed security for the @entity59 in @entity60 , in an interview with @entity62 predicted of @entity15 , " it 's not a matter of whether there will be some incident , it 's just a matter of how bad it 's going to be			0
" no wonder that two days before the @entity43 , more than half of @entity29 believed a terrorist attack on the @entity22 was likely , according to a @entity5 / @entity73 poll			1
now cue up the swarms of " black widows " descending on @entity15 to kill themselves along with many @entity18 spectators			0
and then the @entity22 were held and ... nothing happened it turned out that the most terrifying image from @entity15 was the look of disgust on the face of @entity29 figure skater @entity84 when she learned of her lower - than - expected score			1
@entity15 is only the most recent example of the hyperventilating hyperbole of the doomsday terrorism prognosticators			0
because so many folks were caught flat - footed by 9/11 , some seem to overcompensate by keeping up a steady drumbeat of dire terror warnings			0
in november , @entity95 chairman @entity94 , @entity96 , told @entity5 that @entity98 " poses a bigger threat to attack inside the @entity29 right now than it did before 9/11			1
" @entity94 ' statement defies common sense			0
before 9/11 , @entity98 had an entire county , @entity102 , as a safe haven ; its training camps there churned out thousands of militants every year ; it had access to funding substantial enough so that it could spend several hundred thousand dollars on the 9/11 plot			1
it was a formidable enemy			0
now @entity98 's safe haven is long gone ; the group has n't mounted any successful attack in the @entity29 since 9/11 or , for that matter , anywhere in the @entity115 since the @entity117 transportation system bombings in 2005			1
on 9/11 , the @entity29 had never used armed drones in combat			1
since then , the @entity120 has launched 370 drone strikes at suspected militant targets in @entity123			0
during president @entity126 's tenure alone , those drone strikes have killed more than 30 of @entity98 's leaders in @entity123			1
not only that : the @entity29 is a much harder target than it was on 9/11			1
then there were 16 people on the @entity29 " no fly " list			1
today there are more than 20,000			0
in 2001 , there were 32 @entity140 " fusion centers , " where multiple law enforcement agencies worked together to chase down leads and build terrorism cases			0
the @entity29 intelligence budget also grew dramatically after 9/11			2
in 2010 , the @entity29 spent more than $ 80 billion on intelligence collection and other covert activities , much of it directed at terrorist groups -- more than three times what the country spent in 1998			1
at the time of the 9/11 attacks , the @entity29 @entity150 , the @entity151 and the @entity152 all did n't exist			2
all these new post- 9/11 institutions make it much harder for terrorists to operate in the @entity29			2
the gloom and doom about terrorism becomes much worse when the specter of terrorists deploying chemical , biological , radiological or nuclear weapons is added to the mix. @entity164 , the respected political scientist and founding dean of @entity168 's @entity167 , published a book in 2004 titled " @entity170 , which garnered considerable attention with its prediction that " on the current path , a nuclear terrorist attack on @entity29 in the decade ahead is more likely than not			1
" of course , now we are a decade later , and nothing of the sort has happened			0
indeed , a striking finding of a database of every jihadist terrorism case in the @entity29 since 9/11 maintained by the @entity178 is that not one of the more than 200 individuals who were indicted or convicted of a jihadist terrorism crime acquired , manufactured or deployed chemical , biological or radiological weapons , let alone a nuclear device			2
it 's relatively easy to say the sky is always falling			2
indeed , given the human capacity for evil , bad things are , indeed , going to happen			0
but when the sky does n't fall , which is much of the time when it comes to terrorism , the doomsday prognosticators are rarely held to account			0
in any event , they are too busy warning of the next catastrophe .			0

before @entity43 , predictions of terrorist action were *rampant*
@entity207 says the @entity22 were *unaffected* and predictions turned out to be *wrong*
he says such forecasts fit into a long history of " sky is falling " warnings
@entity216 : statements that @entity98 represents big threat to @entity29 now are off base
