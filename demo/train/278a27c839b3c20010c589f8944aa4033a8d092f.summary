-- in 1974 the @entity2 island of @entity3 was divided in two			1
a coup backed by the @entity6 government was met with a @entity8 military invasion , partitioning the country between the @entity8 - @entity3 north and @entity6 - @entity3 south			1
one of the most enduring symbols of the divide remains the resort of @entity15 , an abandoned district of the ancient city of @entity17 that has come to act as a no - man 's - land between north and south			1
controlled by the @entity8 military , the area 's glistening beaches and apartment blocks remain off - limits to non-military personnel			0
at its peak , @entity15 had 25,000 residents and 12,000 hotel rooms , attracting guests from across @entity30 and the @entity31			1
today , all lie empty and in a state of disrepair			1
" it was one of the centers of tourism of the @entity2 , " laments @entity34 , the @entity35 mayor of @entity17			0
" it used to be very palatial but now it 's for neither @entity6 nor @entity8 @entity3			1
" a group of @entity17 residents and @entity15 citizens in exile hope to change that			1
@entity47 based film - maker , @entity46 , whose @entity6 - @entity3 mother was forced to leave @entity15 , has founded the @entity17 eco-city project -- a grass roots movement led by citizens from both communities			1
their goal is to rebuild the city and transform the resort - town into a cultural , economic and environmental hub that can generate its own energy from renewable sources and grow its own food			2
although the idea is still in the embryonic stages , @entity46 has been encouraged by the early response from both @entity6 and @entity8 @entity3			1
the city 's @entity71 mayor - in - exile , @entity66 , and @entity8 @entity3 mayor , @entity34 -- who recognize each other 's positions -- have pledged to work together towards a future @entity17 metropolis and agreed to form a joint committee to that effect in december last year			1
@entity66 told @entity0 that the project was " one of many good ideas of mutual economic development			2
" yet he warned that " under the circumstances the rebuilding of @entity17 can proceed on more simple lines and must try to avoid anything that at the beginning at least appears utopian			0
" @entity86 ventures that the regeneration plans could help get the local economy moving again after the difficulties of recent years			0
" because of the economic crisis people were found in a very desperate , difficult situation and now i think more than ever they are willing to compromise and let go of the past in order to build the future together , " @entity46 said			0
" the eco-city would actually be a really good economic boost for the island because it will bring in a new kind of tourism , high value tourism ( and ) eco-tourism which did n't exist 40 years ago , " she added			1
so far , a number of willing technical experts have been recruited to the @entity15 revival cause			1
professor @entity106 is a recognized specialist in sustainable architecture			0
he and graduate students from the @entity109 have completed design " phase one " for the eco-city			0
" i am very optimistic , " @entity106 said			0
" something has to be done			0
in this world you ca n't have so called ghost cities sitting there for 40 years just completely vacant			0
" " in this case we have a golden opportunity			0
in fact i consider it to be the perfect prototype for what the world might follow in the future , " @entity106 added			0
energy expert @entity125 , echoed this enthusiasm			0
" @entity17 will be the first thing that happens on the ground if there is a comprehensive settlement ( between @entity71 and @entity8 - @entity3 communities ) , " @entity125 said			2
" the principles of peace , sustainability and permaculture , these are the main principles of the eco-city project , " he added			1
for now , @entity15 remains sectioned - off from the outside world by armed guards and miles of wire fences			2
but @entity125 is confident a solution to the decade 's long stand - off can be found -- an opinion shared by @entity3 president , @entity145 , who said @entity3 ' new deep - sea energy resources could help unite the island when talking to @entity0 last month			2
" if and when that happens we need to be able to take advantage of redeveloping @entity15 as a sustainable destination for tourism , " @entity125 said			2
@entity17 and former residents of @entity15 stand ready to act			2

@entity15 has been virtually *uninhabited* since @entity3 was partitioned in 1974
the town had 12,000 hotel rooms at its peak , all of which sit empty today
a new eco-city project aims to bring @entity15 back to life
