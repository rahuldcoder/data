was a step in the wrong direction			0
the department 's ham - handed effort to improve the political " optics " of active federal involvement may , ironically , create the reasonable doubt that will ultimately clear the shooter , officer @entity19			0
the @entity1 is likely to be impeding justice by proceeding prematurely with a federal investigation while local law enforcement authorities struggle with the facts of the complex and controversial case			1
the @entity1 investigations ( there now appear to be two that have been officially announced ) are highly prejudicial to the local prosecutor 's presentation of the case to the grand jury			1
the non-sequestered grand jurors who return home every night after scrutinizing evidence in the case are almost certain to hear of the existence of the new federal investigation			1
after all , the investigation was personally announced by the attorney general himself after the president publicly commented on the case			2
the grand jurors might reasonably wonder why the federal government would open a civil rights investigation at the very same time they are hearing evidence about @entity9 's most famous homicide			1
some might reasonably wonder : is it possible that police officer @entity19 was motivated by race hatred when he shot and killed @entity5 ? why would the feds be investigating if that were not the case ? although grand jurors are instructed to avoid press coverage of the matters they are investigating , such an instruction is obviously difficult to enforce with the tsunami of demonstrations , press coverage and presidential pronouncements rolling through @entity61			1
the @entity1 should not add to the potential of improperly influencing a sitting grand jury by stirring up additional pretrial publicity as @entity7 did last week			1
notwithstanding the street conviction of officer @entity19 by the " @entity67 , do n't shoot " demonstrators and their allies in the press who appear to march in politically correct lockstep , a sworn grand jury is still evaluating evidence in the case			1
the federal government should not be playing to the press and the crowd while this sensitive homicide investigation proceeds			2
there is plenty of time to commence a federal civil rights investigation and lawsuit when the facts of this case have been sorted out by the citizens who have pledged to evaluate the case in a fair and impartial manner			1
by all accounts , the grand jury presentation is occurring as grand jury presentations normally do in matters of this kind			1
i see no evidence that there has been any delay or improprieties in the current local grand jury proceedings that would justify immediate federal intervention			1
the folly of @entity7 dispatching @entity104 agents to re-interview witnesses , many already interviewed by local law enforcement authorities , is apparent to any experienced criminal lawyer			0
multiple witness statements ( and in this case tv appearances ) create a wealth of material for criminal defense attorneys to add to their cross-examination arsenal			0
eyewitness testimony is often problematic in the best of cases			0
when even truthful witnesses make multiple statements about observations of a fast - moving event , there are often inconsistencies			0
experienced prosecutors attempt to keep a tight rein on the statements of their key witnesses to avoid inconsistencies being used by defense attorneys to create reasonable doubt			0
the @entity1 has blundered even further by conducting its own independent autopsy			0
in a case where forensic evidence relating to powder burns , angle of entry of the fatal bullets and other matters is of critical importance , the @entity1 helps to build reasonable doubt by ensuring three separate autopsy reports will be available for defense attorneys to scrutinize for contradictions and the creation of reasonable doubt			2
conflicting accounts of expert medical witnesses can be devastating to a prosecutor 's case			0
it is also highly unusual that the @entity1 would seek to devote its enormous resources to the investigation of a tiny 50 - person police force in charge of a city with a population of less than 21,000			2
there have been small - town investigations in the past , but they often occur in highly unusual situations , such as the lawsuit brought against @entity162 , @entity163 , a municipality alleged to be virtually owned and operated by @entity165 , the leader of the polygamist cult @entity166 who is serving a life sentence for sexually abusing children in his congregation			0
such investigations are virtually never done while an active , sensitive homicide case is under local grand jury investigation			1
i would imagine there are far greater problems in places like @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 and probably 100 other large @entity189 cities that should be commanding the attention of the @entity1 rather than @entity9			2
and if the pattern and practices of small - town @entity9 require the scrutiny of the @entity1 , surely this can be done after the local authorities finish handling the most important matter facing the town , the @entity5 shooting			1
if the evidence supports an indictment , the officer deserves to be indicted and brought to justice			0
on the other hand , if @entity19 was under apparent attack and fired the fatal shots under the authority granted to police officers by @entity10 law , he deserves to be cleared			0
either way , the decision should be made on the basis of the evidence rather than political meddling by the @entity1			2
while it is encouraging to see the administration finally has a " strategy " in place regarding the nation 's most highly publicized legal case , it might be better if it was one aimed at accomplishing justice rather than undermining it .			0

@entity225 : @entity1 made a mistake with its new investigation of @entity9 police
@entity225 : he says the probe is politically *inspired* and risks prejudicing the @entity5 case
prosecutors and grand jury seeking to decide if criminal charges are warranted , he says
@entity225 : now is not the time to announce that @entity9 police are under federal investigation
