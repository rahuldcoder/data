-- if you 're still querying any economic freeze between @entity5 and the @entity6 , digest this line from @entity8 the day @entity2 's sanctions took effect : the @entity17 " have gone against their own interests to do the bidding of their senior colleagues from across the ocean , " the @entity5 financial giant said			1
that 's a publicly - traded , @entity19 - style bank bluntly calling @entity2 governments lapdogs of the @entity21 it 's not a statement likely to win @entity19 business in the future			0
to be clear , these sanctions could never have been agreed by the divided , 28 - nation bloc if 298 people had not been blown out of the sky over @entity29			2
this is an unparalleled precedent set by the @entity17 , a group that hardly ever agrees on anything of substance			1
it has now taken steps that will harm its own economy in order to stand up to @entity5			1
the sanctions are tough , but have holes			2
@entity41 , for example , can still deliver a pre-paid @entity43 - class warship to @entity5			1
and the @entity2 branches of @entity5 's big banks can still operate as normal			1
but @entity2 companies are suffering			0
@entity47 is closing stores in @entity5 in anticipation of deteriorating sales			1
@entity51 and @entity52 have already noted a slowdown that pre-dates the sanctions			0
@entity56 and engineering giant @entity55 has said it sees a " serious risk " to @entity2 growth as a result of the sanctions			0
these companies are not complaining and are not taking sides			0
they are doing due diligence and telling their shareholders the rules have changed and they expect an adverse impact			0
in @entity69 , there is debate as to whether the city will suffer			0
luxury homes , car sales , art and wine investment , private school enrollment and football teams have all benefited from @entity5 investments			1
i believe the city could see upside			0
the @entity82 has reported the numbers of @entity5 putting their children into posh private schools is soaring			1
the @entity82 has reported oligarchs are contemplating suing the @entity17 or the individual governments to remove them from sanctions lists , and the best place for that is @entity69 's @entity92			1
such cases will generate significant fees for @entity69 's lawyers and public relations firms			0
however , @entity5 firms contemplating listing on the @entity99 may pause , out of caution investors could shy away			2
i do wonder if changing sentiment will generate the most long - term pain between @entity2 and @entity5			2
more sectors could be hit as financiers fear future sanctions and retaliation from @entity108 , deals could dry up and finance could flee			0
that , in turn , could put a chill on @entity2 firms doing deals in @entity5 even if they are is not impacted by sanctions			1
an economic cold wind , if not war , is certainly blowing through the financial capitals of @entity2			0
