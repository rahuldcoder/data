-- it has been said that health policy is too important to be left solely to doctors , because the determinants of health lie mainly outside the medical care system			1
for complementary reasons i would say that economic policy is too important to be left solely to economists			2
the effects of economic policy are much more than economic , health principally among them			2
in fact , so close is the link between social and economic policy and health , that health can serve as an evaluator of policy , a kind of social accountant			1
arguably , we value health more than we value growth in the gross domestic product			2
health as a social accountant is highly relevant to debates about macroeconomic policy in the wake of the global financial crisis			1
my caricature of what passes for debate on macro-economic policy is that austerians believe that national debt has to be reduced in order to get economic growth			1
@entity39 believe that you have to get economic growth in order to reduce debt			0
therefore , a booming economy , not an ailing one , is the time for government to spend less			0
as a non-economist , my solution to the debate is to look not at which policy leads more quickly to economic growth , but at the effect of policy on the lives people are able to lead , and thus on their health			2
whatever good economic effects the authors of policies of austerity imagine them to have , their effects on the lives of young people in @entity63 have been disastrous			1
there is little doubt that policies of austerity have contributed to youth unemployment in large numbers			1
recent figures show unemployment rates of 15 to 24 - year - olds are 36 % in @entity72 , more than 41 % in @entity73 , almost 60 % in @entity74 and almost 58 % @entity75			0
by contrast , the figure is just over 11 % in the @entity78 and under 8 % in @entity79			0
perhaps some of these young people in @entity63 are in " informal " employment , and should n't be counted as unemployed			2
even so , there is still a major issue of youth unemployment			1
it is little use politicians lecturing school leavers to stop being layabouts and get a job , if the jobs are not there			0
arguably , policies of austerity make job opportunities more scarce			0
youth unemployment matters for at least three reasons			1
first , unemployment is bad for mental and physical health			1
looking across @entity63 , in general the higher the unemployment rate of a country the higher the suicide rate , and the homicide rate			1
far from unemployment being a lifestyle choice , people dislike it so much they are more likely to kill themselves , and each other			0
the short term effects of unemployment are on mental health			1
in the longer term , physical health is damaged			1
in the 1980s economic downturn in @entity116 , there was clear evidence that unemployment was associated with an increase in mortality of about 20 % , compared with people in the same occupational class			0
second , young people who leave education for the scrap heap are in danger of never getting gainful employment with any security			0
the implication is a life of social marginality , including social isolation , poverty and homelessness -- all of which are bad for health			1
throw into the mix the fact that the unemployed have worse diets , are more likely to smoke , and may suffer from the effects of alcohol and drugs , and you have a potent recipe for ill - health			0
third , ill - effects on health are correlated with other unfortunate social consequences			2
the riots that scarred @entity151 in the summer of 2011 began in @entity152			0
i had been citing @entity152 as having the worst male life expectancy in @entity151 , 18 years shorter than that in affluent @entity156 and @entity157			0
what a coincidence that the riots should have started in @entity152 , and not in @entity156 and @entity157			0
of 1,000 young rioters going through magistrate courts , 91.4 % were not in education , employment or training			0
why would a young person with a job , or in education , or training , want to riot and loot , when they have a stake in the future ? i do not believe in counsels of despair			0
the problem of youth unemployment and health is soluble			1
one strategy is to deal with youth unemployment by making it a prime consideration for macro-economic policy			1
other things equal , as economists love to say , do not pursue policies that throw young people on the scrapheap			0
a complementary strategy is to pursue active labor market policies that have the twin strategy of reasonable unemployment benefits and mechanisms to help young people into training or employment			0
evidence from across @entity63 suggests that the greater the investment in active labor market policies the less effect unemployment has on suicide rates			2
an economic policy to prevent mental illness ? as a public health doctor i would recommend it			2

@entity221 says austerity has increased youth unemployment in @entity63
@entity221 argues that unemployment is bad for mental and physical health
he says resulting social marginality , poverty and homelessness harm health
unemployment should be a *key* consideration in macro-economic policy , @entity221 says
