-- @entity2 's first patient was a 38 - year - old woman who had been diagnosed with @entity4 breast cancer			1
the patient had waited nearly six months after feeling a lump in her breast to visit the doctor			1
she had no health insurance			2
it was @entity2 's job , as @entity13 's patient navigator , to guide the single mother through treatment and , hopefully , into recovery			1
patient navigation is a relatively new field in the health care industry			1
a navigator 's primary role is to remove the obstacles patients face in accessing or receiving treatment			2
more hospitals are creating these positions to help patients traverse an often - confusing medical system			1
despite her inexperience , @entity2 could relate to the fear she saw in the patient 's eyes			2
" i know what the shock of a diagnosis is like			2
i know what the waiting and the unknowns are like , " she says			0
" i have n't experienced it personally , but i think sometimes it 's worse when it 's your child going through it			0
" @entity2 's daughter , @entity44 , was almost 8 months old when doctors first spotted a problem			0
one of @entity44 's eyes was n't tracking properly , and soon after it started to bulge			0
doctors at @entity50 diagnosed an optic glioma , or a tumor growing around the nerve that connects the eye to the brain			0
by the time she was 18 months old , @entity44 had lost sight in both eyes			0
@entity44 went through four years of chemotherapy , several major surgeries and six weeks of radiation all before the age of 7			0
new to @entity63 , @entity64 , and a single mother , @entity2 struggled to keep @entity44 's frequent doctor appointments in @entity67 , about two hours from home , as well as work a full - time job as a radiologist for @entity71 and juggle never - ending insurance forms			0
" it 's a lot , " @entity2 says			0
" and when you are going through that diagnosis , and then you have all of that on top of it , it can be very overwhelming			0
" 4 ways to control your health care costs four years ago , @entity2 got a notice from the @entity86 foundation about a grant for breast cancer patient navigation			1
what on earth is patient navigation ? she wondered			1
after a bit of research , @entity2 realized what had been missing from her experience with @entity44			0
" i did n't have somebody who was my go - to person , " she says			0
@entity2 applied for the grant , and @entity71 was awarded enough money to start a program			2
in her role as a patient navigator , @entity2 does community outreach to raise awareness about the importance of breast cancer screening			1
she is one of the first staff members to meet with a patient after a diagnosis , providing them with information that they can read later when the shock has worn off			2
she works with specialists to arrange appointments and helps connect women with financial aid , transportation or child care if they need it			0
" when you get that initial diagnosis , you just have a lot of questions , " she says			0
" and it 's hard to pick up the phone and speak to your physician or nurse every time you have a question			0
that 's what i 'm here for			0
" patient navigation programs are the result of the medical community 's new emphasis on patient - centered care , says @entity136 , associate director of community programs at @entity139 's @entity138			1
" patient navigation , in part , is a function of how fragmented our ( health care ) system is , " @entity140 says			1
" it makes it difficult to have a seamless experience			0
" are we prepared for 18 million cancer survivors ? advocates say patient - centered care can improve outcomes and reduce costs , so much so that hospital reimbursement from insurance companies is now partially tied to patients ' opinions on how well a facility treated them			1
in 2011 , the @entity160 on @entity138 established new accreditation standards for cancer facilities , requiring them to incorporate " a patient navigation process to address health care disparities and barriers to care			1
" the standards move us closer to a future dr. @entity168 first envisioned in the 1980s			1
@entity168 then was a breast cancer surgeon in @entity170 , @entity171 , trying to figure out why patients in his hospital had a five - year survival rate of 39 % when it should have been closer to 85 %			1
@entity168 realized many patients were being diagnosed with late - stage breast cancers ; they were arriving at the clinic with large masses that had obviously been ignored			1
@entity168 identified five main barriers his patients faced in receiving care : financial , communication , medical system , psychological and personal			1
obstacles ranged from not having health insurance to not understanding the language			0
some patients feared doctors or mistrusted medical advice			2
others simply missed chemotherapy because they could n't find child care			0
" people got lost in the complex system , " @entity168 says			1
in 1990 , he pioneered the first - ever patient navigation program , training people from the community to listen and answer questions after a diagnosis			1
he also began an educational program to advocate for screenings			2
over time he increased patients ' five - year survival rate in the same population to 70 %			2
these barriers are never going to go away completely , @entity168 says , but patient navigation can help address them			1
" can you eliminate poverty ? probably not ... but you can change the things that poverty means , " he says			0
" if poor people are less educated , you can educate poor people			0
if poor people do n't have access to screening , diagnosis or treatment , you can create programs to concentrate on those one by one			0
" for now , patient navigation is primarily being used in the cancer community , but it 's spreading to other chronic diseases			1
even patient navigation , @entity168 says , falls prey to our fragmented system -- one filled with specialists that each operate in a separate universe			1
5 million more people living with diabetes @entity168 compares the care continuum , from the first examination to survivorship , to a mile relay			1
" it takes teams of people passing batons one to the other until the last runner crosses the finish line			0
" since starting the patient navigator program at @entity71 , @entity2 has helped hundreds of women cross that finish line			1
she often receives letters of thanks from patients who say she helped them feel empowered to make informed decisions in a time of chaos			2
" i think when you go through things as a patient , you know , as a parent -- to be able to be treated with compassion and not just ( as ) another diagnosis is a gift , " @entity2 says			2
" and that 's what i hope i provide			0
" let 's talk about sex ... and cancer			2

more hospitals are hiring patient navigators to help patients through a confusing system
most navigators are working in cancer centers , but the idea is spreading to other areas
dr. @entity168 pioneered the first patient navigation program in 1990
