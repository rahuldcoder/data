@entity0 -- @entity2 successfully fended off a legal move by @entity4 to block the sale of its tablet computers in the @entity8 but only after suffering the indignity of a judge ruling that its @entity9 were " not cool " enough to be mistaken for @entity12			1
@entity4 had claimed three models of the @entity14 too closely resembled the design of the @entity12			1
but judge @entity16 ruled that there were noticeable differences between the tablets in terms of their thickness and the designs on the back			0
" they do not have the same understated and extreme simplicity which is possessed by the @entity4 design , " the judge said of the @entity2 gadgets			1
" they are not as cool			0
" the ruling is the latest skirmish in a global patent battle that @entity4 has been waging since 2010 against companies like @entity2 and @entity34 which produce tablet computers and mobile phones using @entity39 's @entity38 operating system			2
such devices are the biggest commercial threat to @entity4 , and rivals have accused the @entity44 company of using its patents aggressively to disrupt their sales			1
last month @entity4 persuaded a @entity48 court to put a temporary block on sales of @entity52 phones and tablets in the @entity44 , pending a full court trial over patent claims at the end of july			2
last week an appeals court lifted the ban on smartphone sales while upholding the block on sales of the tablet			0
@entity4 shipped 11.8m @entity12 during the first three months of the year , giving it a worldwide market share of 68 per cent , according to @entity64 , the technology research company			1
@entity2 devices have started to gain traction , however , taking the @entity68 company to second place in global market share in the first quarter			0
despite the legal wrangling , @entity2 reported record operating profits last week , largely on the back of sales of its @entity52 smartphones			0
the company has said it expects to have sold more than 10m units of its latest smartphone , the @entity79 , by july			0
@entity4 has been given 21 days to appeal against the @entity8 ruling			1
it said : " it 's no coincidence that @entity2 's latest products look a lot like the @entity84 and @entity12 , from the shape of the hardware to the user interface and even the packaging			2
this kind of blatant copying is wrong and , as we 've said many times before , we need to protect @entity4 's intellectual property when companies steal our ideas			0
" @entity2 welcomed the ruling and said : " should @entity4 continue to make excessive legal claims in other countries based on such generic designs , innovation in the industry could be harmed and consumer choice unduly limited			2

@entity8 judge rules @entity9 " not cool " enough to be mistaken for @entity12
@entity4 claimed three models were too similar to its @entity12 design
