@entity0 -- @entity3 security officials on tuesday started the process of evacuating some 150 @entity6 residents from their homes at the @entity9 settlement of @entity10 the @entity3 government vowed to evacuate the @entity13 neighborhood by july 1 after the @entity3 @entity14 ruled last year that the settlers ' houses were built on privately owned @entity18 land			1
fifteen of the neighborhood 's 30 families were moved to a nearby temporary neighborhood			2
the evacuation process is due to be completed by the end of this week , the @entity3 @entity22 said			1
the decision to go ahead with the move was initially met with fierce resistance from the settler movement			2
earlier this month a @entity9 mosque was vandalized and partially set on fire			0
graffiti sprayed outside the walls of the mosque read " @entity33 " and " @entity34			0
" " price tag " is a term frequently used by radical @entity3 settlers to denote reprisal attacks against @entity18 in response to moves by the @entity3 government to evacuate illegal @entity9 outposts , or as retribution for attacks by @entity18			1
three weeks ago , residents of the settlement set off on a two - day march from the controversial neighborhood to the @entity3 @entity49 parliamentary building in @entity0 and called for a bill which would bypass the court 's decision and legalize their homes			1
in an effort to satisfy the settlement residents , @entity3 prime minister @entity55 announced a plan to build 300 new housing units in a separate area of @entity10 following negotiations with the @entity3 government , the residents eventually agreed to leave their homes without resistance			1
an additional 550 units are to be built in other settlements in the @entity9			2
@entity65 , the @entity18 owner of the land , told @entity1 he was extremely moved by the decision of the @entity3 court : " i felt very excited , just like finding a few million dollars on the street			1
the land for me was almost lost			2
my lawyers were very faithful and encouraged us to keep going			0
it took five years to get our land back			2
" @entity65 said he did feel sympathy for the settlers as well			0
" as a human being i feel sorry for them , but they have done something wrong			0
you talk about democracy , right ? the right of ownership is a principle in democracy , the right of speech is a principle in democracy , and this is my land			0
" @entity92 , a spokesman for the @entity3 @entity93 , told @entity1 the deal with the settlers was reached through great effort and numerous coordinations with the leaders of the local community			1
" we believe that preparation is paying off			0
it is a delicate , sensitive and complicated relocation process			0
however the courts have spoken and the @entity93 is committed to upholding the rule of law			0
" the highly contentious issue of @entity3 construction in the @entity9 and @entity0 -- land the @entity18 seek for a future state -- is one of the main sticking points preventing the resumption of negotiations between @entity3 and @entity18 .			1
