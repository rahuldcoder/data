-- on my way to interview dr. @entity3 , @entity4 , the celebrated psychoanalyst and @entity6 professor who teaches and writes about love , i took a little detour into my past			1
around the corner from @entity3 's home was the quaint old brownstone where , long ago , a handsome stranger arrived on my doorstep			1
he was n't looking for love ; he was looking for an apartment			1
my latest bad - news boyfriend had just suggested i get silicone implants ; suddenly , i was ready to supplant him			2
the apartment hunter and i talked , we had coffee , and a year later , we got married			2
where did i go right ? @entity3 can answer that			1
she is a dark - haired woman with warm eyes and an air of absolute confidence			0
if love is a battlefield , she 's a five - star general			1
her mission , these days , is to help people understand how love can turn their lives around -- though not necessarily in the ways they expect			1
" i think romantic love is one of the great change agents , " she says as we sit in her book - lined living room overlooking @entity38			1
" we come to know ourselves in a different way when we fall in love , and whatever happens to that relationship , we are changed			1
we know something we did n't know before			0
we discover capacities that we did n't think we had			0
you did it , " she tells me			0
" you had a relationship that did n't work , and you changed			0
you said , ' enough ! ' " @entity0 : romance rehab " @entity55 , " i answer , " but look at all the years i wasted			0
" people should not judge failed love affairs as failed experiences but as part of the growth process			1
something does not have to end well for it to have been one of the most valuable experiences of a lifetime			0
" try telling @entity66 that			0
most people i know still cling to the idea that love has to have a happy ending			1
when a relationship breaks up , they feel cheated of their future			0
and if they 've never fallen in love , they become desperately afraid they never will			1
" people can love more than once , " person assures me			1
" and love happens to people of all ages , because one 's internal life changes , as well as one 's opportunities			1
i do n't see love as something that if you do n't get it by the time you 're 30 , cross it off the list			1
" when you 're a therapist , she says , people come to you in anguish about a love affair that 's gone sour , a marriage that 's gone wrong			1
and some people worry that they 'll never be able to let go enough to love anybody : " the reason is usually buried in their childhood , in some fear of being found wanting , or in parental disapproval			1
not that the parent does n't love the child , but that the parent does n't see the potential beauty or the soul in a child , ca n't really endorse her in some way			1
" people may also find it hard to love if they 've been abused by their parents or were so overmonitored that they feel any relationship means being imprisoned			1
or someone may have had parents who were miserably mismatched and says , ' i will never let myself be in the situation that my mother was in			0
to get married is to give away my autonomy , and i 'm not going to do it			0
' so our capacity to love often depends on having a good enough childhood -- not a great one , just good enough			1
" @entity0 : the biggest love myths can we ever undo the effects of a really disastrous childhood ? ( i 've been married for 27 years now , and i 'm still working on that one			1
) " yes , through experience , sometimes through therapy , " person says			1
" some people go away from home for college or a job and find out that not everybody is like the family they grew up in			0
what 's great is that we can relearn , recondition , and see other possibilities			1
" okay , but how do you preserve your hard - won sense of self and still experience the enraptured merging that most of us see as the essence of romance ? " in fact , " says person , " all love has this internal dynamic between togetherness and oneness , and independence and separateness			1
i think that for a love affair to flourish , there have to be independent interests that can be shared , as well as interests that are the same			2
" one person described it well in talking about his parents			2
he said they were looking out in the same direction instead of always staring into each other 's eyes			2
intense physical passion waxes and wanes			0
once you 've had it , it can always come back			0
but what sustains you in between is having something that interests you both enough that you can share it , talk about it , do it together			0
" a confession : my husband and i have had some of our biggest arguments about which video to watch			0
mention the @entity179 if you want to see my hackles rise			0
@entity0 : finding and keeping the love of your life " well , you have to pick your fights , " person says , confessing that she herself is perfectly capable of fighting to the death over the color to paint a bedroom			1
" look , in any good relationship there have to be bursts of anger and disagreement			0
and in those moments , if somebody asked , ' are you in love ? ' you 'd say , ' are you kidding me ? ' but those become part and parcel of the journey			2
we have the capacity to repair relationships -- it 's like having a scratch that heals			2
in other words , our psychological makeup has built - in healing mechanisms the same way our body does			0
you have to have enough conviction in the strength of the bond that you can risk some disagreement			0
you have to be able to take a hit			0
" a tall order if you 're already one of the walking wounded			0
having grown up with parents whose fights were soul shattering , i thought relationship was a code word for pain			0
giving up that preconception felt like a giant leap into the dark			0
it took years of dead - end love affairs ( and a healthy dose of therapy ) to push me over the edge			2
i not only had to find someone who could love me , i finally realized , i had to take the risk of loving him back			2
that 's the kind of risk @entity3 fully approves of			1
" people are so different in their ability to let go			0
they need to know in the back of their minds that if it does n't work , it 's not the end of the world			2
if i sorrow for anyone , it 's for someone who has never rolled the dice , rather than for someone who has rolled the dice and lost a hand or two			2
