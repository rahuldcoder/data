-- as @entity2 expanded his new @entity3 and conquered much of @entity4 , he doled out the spoils of war to his friends and family , whether they wanted it or not			1
@entity2 's older brother @entity9 , described by historians as " idealist , mild mannered , and lacking in vigor , " had wanted to be a writer , but was instead pressured into following his father into a law career			1
his brother had other plans for him , and installed him first on the throne of @entity20 and later , @entity21			1
@entity9 took both positions reluctantly , and did n't fill either very well			1
almost as soon as he was crowned in @entity21 , a popular revolt against @entity25 rule began			2
@entity9 suffered a string of defeats as he and @entity25 forces engaged what was left of the @entity21 regular army , and he asked his brother if he could abdicate and return to @entity20			1
@entity2 would n't have it , and left @entity9 to keep a tenuous grasp on his army ( the generals under his command insisted on checking with @entity2 before carrying out any of @entity9 's orders ) and kingdom			1
unable to beat back the rebels and their @entity40 allies , @entity9 abdicated his throne in 1813 , having ruled for just over five years			1
born to run after @entity2 's defeat and forced exile , the @entity43 name was n't winning @entity9 any friends in @entity4 , so he fled to the @entity47 under an assumed and with the crown jewels of @entity21 stashed in his suitcase			1
he initially settled in @entity50 , then moved to @entity51 , where his house at 260 @entity54 9th became the center of activity for @entity47 's @entity25 expatriate community			2
he eventually moved to a large estate in @entity59 , @entity60 , twenty - five miles northeast of @entity51 along the @entity61			2
there , @entity9 , former king of @entity20 and @entity21 , brother of @entity2 , emperor of @entity25 , took the title of @entity66 ( though his @entity47 neighbors and friends still called him mr. @entity2 and referred to his home as " @entity70 " ) and went into quiet , suburban exile			1
@entity72 : @entity74 's big block of cheese mansion on the hill @entity2 may have been dethroned , but he was still royalty			1
he built up the estate to reflect his social standing			0
he constructed a vast mansion for himself , with a large wine cellar , floor - to - ceiling mirrors , elaborate crystal chandeliers , marble fireplaces and grand staircases			2
his library held the largest collection of books in the country at the time ( eight thousand volumes versus the sixty - five hundred volumes of the @entity93 )			0
the land surrounding the mansion was elaborately landscaped and featured ten miles of carriage paths , rare trees and plants , gazebos , gardens , fountains and an artificial lake stocked with imported @entity104 swans			2
@entity2 's home became a social hub for both his @entity60 neighbors , who liked to spend quiet afternoons browsing his library , and @entity47 and @entity104 elites			1
among the distinguished guests who came through @entity63 were @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , the @entity114 , and @entity115 , a @entity25 banker from @entity51 who was then the richest man in the @entity47 since @entity2 's wife did not accompany him to @entity47 ( he did not see her for 25 years after he left ) , another frequent guest at the house was his mistress , @entity117			1
@entity2 had met @entity117 , the 18 - year - old , @entity25 - speaking daughter of distinguished @entity121 merchants , while he was shopping for suspenders at her mother 's shop in @entity51			1
during their time together , @entity2 and @entity117 would have two daughters , @entity127 and @entity128			2
@entity72 : how @entity129 ended up with @entity131 's hair fire in january 1820 , @entity2 's mansion caught fire and burned to the ground			1
his neighbors rushed to the house and managed to save most of the silver and his priceless art collection			0
contemporary newspaper reports called the blaze accidental , but according to the gossip around town , a local woman , an immigrant from @entity146 , set the fire as revenge for @entity2 's invasion of her homeland			1
@entity2 was touched by his neighbors ' assistance , and expressed those feelings in a letter he wrote to one of the town 's magistrates : " all the furniture , statues , pictures , money , plate gold , jewels , linen , books , and in short , everything that was not consumed , has been most scrupulously delivered into the hands of the people of my house			1
" in the night of the fire , and during the next day , there were brought to me , by laboring men , drawers , in which i have found the proper quantity of pieces of money , and medals of gold , and valuable jewels , which might have been taken with impunity			0
" this event has proved to me how much the inhabitants of @entity59 appreciate the interest i have always felt for them ; and shows that men in general are good , when they have not been perverted in their youth by a bad education			0
... @entity47 are , without contradiction , the most happy people i have known ; still more happy if they understand well their own happiness			0
i pray you not to doubt of my sincere regard			0
" -- @entity9 , count de @entity194 [ as reprinted in @entity195 and the @entity196 , by @entity197 ( 1879 ) ] @entity2 rebuilt his mansion and remained in @entity60			1
he took ill and returned to @entity4 in 1839			0
when he died in 1844 , @entity63 passed to his grandson , who sold it and most of its contents at auction three years later			0
some of the furnishings and paintings are now in the collections of the @entity207 and the @entity208			0
@entity72 : the girl who grew @entity131 's beard a night with the ' @entity211 ' during his years at @entity63 , @entity2 believed he had a run - in with one of the @entity60 's most infamous residents -- the @entity211			1
according to the folklore of @entity60 's @entity218 region , the @entity215 was born around 1735			1
mother @entity211 was in labor with her thirteenth child when the burden of the dozen she already had finally made her snap			2
" @entity226 , " she cried as she pushed the baby out			0
the healthy baby boy in the midwife 's arms suddenly changed before the women 's eyes , growing wings , hooves , fur and a tail			2
the beastly baby screeched and flew out the window , making its home in the @entity218 and haunting and harassing the people who lived there			2
as @entity2 recounted the story , he was hunting alone in the woods near his estate when he saw some peculiar tracks on the ground			1
they looked like they belonged to a horse or a donkey , but one that was walking only on its hind legs			0
he followed the tracks until they ended abruptly , as if the animal had jumped into the air and flown off			0
he stopped and stared at them			0
a strange hissing noise came from behind him			0
he whirled around and came face to face with an animal he had never seen before			0
it had a long neck , wings , legs like a crane with horse 's hooves at the end , stumpy arms with paws and a face like a horse or a camel			2
he froze , and for a minute neither he nor the creature moved or even breathed			0
then , the @entity215 hissed again and flew away			0
@entity2 later told his friends what happened , and they filled him in on the local legend			2
until he returned to @entity4 , @entity2 is said to have kept a sharp eye out for the @entity215 whenever he was in the woods , hoping to kill it and take the body as a trophy			2
last to die the @entity43 had another @entity47 connection			0
@entity2 's younger brother , @entity283 , visited the @entity47 in 1803 and fell in love with @entity285 , the daughter of a wealthy @entity287 merchant			1
they married that same year , but @entity2 did not approve and ordered his brother back to @entity25			1
@entity283 went home , annulled his marriage , remarried , and became @entity283			0
but not before consummating his marriage to @entity285			0
she was already pregnant when @entity283 left the @entity47 and gave birth to another @entity295			0
the stateside branch of the family tree produced some notable members -- including @entity299 , secretary of the navy under @entity129 -- but petered out a few decades ago			0
@entity300 , great - grandnephew of @entity2 , was walking his dog in @entity302 in 1943 , when he tripped over the leash , cracked his skull open on the ground and died			1
