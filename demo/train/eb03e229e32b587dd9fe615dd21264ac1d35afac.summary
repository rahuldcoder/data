-- i was born 70 years ago this spring in the @entity2 in @entity3			1
in the years i 've lived , more than 500,000 @entity4 have died and almost 1 million have been wounded in at least 15 @entity4 military conflicts			1
some wars were long and cost a great deal in lives and treasure , such as @entity10 and the @entity11 ; others were short and cheap , such as the invasion of @entity14 in 1983			0
@entity4 are being killed and wounded today in @entity15 in a war that has lasted 12 years , the longest in @entity4 history			1
and now some in @entity18 and elsewhere are calling for @entity4 military action in @entity20 and @entity21			1
one thing you can count on : every @entity4 military intervention takes surprising turns and is beset by unexpected problems			1
@entity27 looks a lot easier in the planning stages than it does once the bullets and bombs are flying			0
when i was born in 1943 , the @entity4 had 12 million men and women under arms and -- with its allies -- was beginning to swing the fortunes of war in @entity39 and the @entity40 against the @entity41			2
@entity10 was a " good war , " a necessary horror that prevented the even worse horror of fascism taking over the world			0
the @entity4 has more than 60,000 service personnel fighting the last vestiges of the war in @entity15			1
this is a war that began with a necessary mission -- to remove the @entity52 regime that gave refuge and support to the terrorist organization responsible for the deaths of thousands of @entity4			2
over time , however , the mission was transformed into a much broader and far more difficult imperative -- to bring effective governance and security to @entity15			0
that is a mission of choice , not necessity			0
the @entity4 has been at war in the greater @entity65 more or less continuously since the early 1980s			0
in 1982 , the @entity4 put a small force in @entity67 to facilitate the withdrawal of @entity70 forces from @entity71 during the @entity73 occupation			1
over time the mission grew , and the @entity4 became involved in the @entity67 civil war			1
the @entity4 @entity76 was bombed , along with the @entity77 , with the loss of 241 @entity4 lives			0
the situation continued to escalate until president @entity81 had the wisdom to withdraw @entity4 forces from a conflict getting rapidly out of hand			0
all too soon , the @entity4 was back at war in the @entity65			0
it skirmished with @entity21 forces through much of the 1980s			0
in the 1990s , the @entity4 and its allies liberated @entity89 and established no - fly zones over , and conducted strikes against , @entity92			1
in the current century , the @entity4 fought in @entity15 and invaded @entity92 and put down an insurgency there			1
reasonable people can disagree about the wisdom of @entity4 actions in each of these situations , but they were all wars of choice , not of necessity			2
too often , decisions to intervene militarily were founded on incomplete or erroneous information , the 2003 @entity4 invasion of @entity92 being a case in point			1
each of the @entity4 military interventions in the @entity65 has evolved in unexpected ways			2
only rarely have @entity4 political leaders had the discipline to stick to the original mission			0
today @entity20 looks very similar to @entity67 in the early 1980s in its complexity of ethnic , religious , political and clan conflicts			1
yet some in @entity18 want the @entity4 to arm the rebels or enforce no - fly zones			0
sen. @entity117 , @entity119 - @entity118 , has even argued for @entity4 " boots on the ground " to protect @entity20 's chemical weapons from terrorists			1
the @entity4 may go into @entity20 with limited aims , but the risk of unforeseen consequences would be grave			1
others argue @entity4 should go to war with @entity21 to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons , but no one can predict with certainty how effective that would be or how it might evolve			1
most experts believe decisive action would require a concerted air campaign lasting weeks			0
leaders of @entity21 's @entity137 have said they would adopt guerrilla tactics if @entity21 was attacked			0
if @entity21 's commandoes attacked @entity4 forces or installations in the region , or those of @entity4 allies , how many incidents would it take before the @entity4 decided to replace the regime in @entity148 -- the only sure way to end the conflict ? as i look back at @entity4 military involvements in my lifetime , i see many wars in which @entity4 accomplished great things -- defending vital @entity4 interests or sacrificing in defense of international law			1
there may be such necessary cases in the future , such as honoring the @entity4 commitment to defend @entity163			2
but i also see wars in which the @entity4 blundered into complicated situations with disastrous results for the country and for others			2
@entity4 's leaders should learn from the country 's previous military involvements			2
they should not casually initiate conflict with only limited understanding of complex situations			0
it 's past time for greater caution in commitments of @entity4 military forces , particularly in the @entity65			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			0

since @entity181 was born 70 years ago , @entity4 has engaged in at least 15 wars
to name a few : @entity67 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity163 , @entity15 and @entity92 , he says
@entity181 : missions take surprising turns ; @entity4 gets more involved and ca *n't* get out
he warns we must not call for military action in @entity20 or @entity21 without very serious thought
