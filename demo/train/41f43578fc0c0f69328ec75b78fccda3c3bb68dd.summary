@entity0 -- the @entity2 ruled for a @entity4 woman accused of violating laws tied to a chemical - weapons treaty when she attacked the other woman in a love triangle			1
the justices by a unanimous vote on monday concluded the government overstepped its authority when prosecuting @entity13 , as part of the country 's obligations enforcing a chemical weapons agreement			1
at issue was whether @entity19 may criminalize conduct -- under its treaty ratification power -- that is otherwise the domain of the states			2
@entity25 was given a long prison sentence in the federal system after being convicted of using potentially lethal chemicals against a romantic rival			1
she would have likely gotten a much shorter sentence under state law			1
the decision sends the case back to lower courts , which could vacate the conviction			1
the case of toxic love has soap - opera elements , but @entity25 's lawyers argued she was being treated like a foreign terrorist instead of someone caught up in an act of personal revenge against a friend			1
" the global need to prevent chemical warfare does not require the federal government to reach into the kitchen cupboard , " chief justice @entity45 wrote in his narrowly framed opinion , " or to treat a local assault with a chemical irritant as the deployment of a chemical weapon			1
" beyond this fact - specific dispute , the case touched on larger concerns about the strength and purpose of the @entity61 's 10th amendment , designed to preserve state power			1
it is also a question roiling the current political debate , especially among tea party conservatives in this post- 9/11 , security - conscious environment			2
the court majority largely avoided those questions in its ruling			0
@entity45 said the facts of the case limited their scope			1
" this exceptional convergence of factors gives us serious reason to doubt the government 's expansive reading of the [ law ] , and calls for us to interpret the statute more narrowly			0
" @entity25 , a native of @entity82 , lived outside @entity83 and worked as a microbiologist			0
as a federal appeals court succinctly summarized the relevant facts in the case : " @entity25 was excited when her closest friend , @entity88 , announced she was pregnant			1
@entity25 's excitement turned to rage when she learned that her husband , @entity91 , was the child 's father			1
" the woman , known to her family as @entity96 , struck back by stealing dangerous a chemical -- arsenic - based 10 - chloro - @entity98 - phenoxarsine -- from her company			1
she also obtained potassium dichromate over the @entity101			0
both substances in heavy doses can cause toxic , even lethal harm with very little physical contact			0
the 42 - year - old then tried to poison @entity108 some two dozen times over several months , secretly sprinkling small amounts of the chemicals on an apartment doorknob , car door handles , and a mailbox			0
while suffering no more than a chemical burn on her thumb , @entity108 grew suspicious -- one of the chemicals was a bright orange powder			2
after getting little help from local police , in 2007 she called postal inspectors , who set up surveillance cameras			0
@entity25 was videotaped stealing mail and placing chemicals inside the mailbox and a car muffler , court records show			0
@entity25 admitted her guilt early on and claimed she never meant to kill @entity108 , but only wanted to cause her " an uncomfortable rash			0
" the defendant also said her friend 's betrayal caused an " emotional breakdown " that made her respond in such a shocking fashion			0
instead of being charged with simple assault , which may have gotten her six months to a year or two in state prison , @entity25 was indicted in federal court on two counts of mail fraud and -- the bombshell -- two counts of violating a federal law and international treaty on the possession and use of " chemical weapons			1
" when a judge denied her motions to transfer the case to state court , @entity25 pleaded guilty and immediately appealed			1
she received a sentence of six years behind bars and nearly $ 12,000 in fines and restitution			0
she was released in august 2012			0
there are about 1,000 treaties signed by the @entity157 currently on the books			0
many academics and lawmakers had hoped the majority right - leaning bench will use this opportunity to delve further into the scope of the 10th amendment , which states , " the powers not delegated to the @entity157 by the @entity61 , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people			2
" in the broader political context , a bipartisan sphere of @entity157 worry the federal government and @entity19 have been overly aggressive in staking claims to disputes they believe are best left to states , especially in the criminal arena			2
and it is not just felonies			0
areas like gun ownership , zoning laws , environmental regulations , taxation , health care , and education standards all could be re-examined in the wake of this high court decision			0
while agreeing the prosecution of @entity25 was improper , three other members of the court -- justices @entity193 , @entity195 , and @entity196 -- would have gone farther and said the court should decide whether the law was a proper exercise of federal power			2
" we have here a supposedly ' narrow ' opinion which , in order to be ' narrow , ' sets forth interpretive principles never before imagined that will bedevil our jurisprudence ( and proliferate litigation ) for years to come			0
the immediate product of these interpretive novelties is a statute that should be the envy of every lawmaker bent on trapping the unwary with vague and uncertain criminal prohibitions , " said @entity193			0
he added that the majority " enables the fundamental constitutional principle of limited federal powers to be set aside by the president and @entity218 's exercise of the treaty power			1
we should not have shirked our duty and distorted the law to preserve that assertion ; we should have welcomed and eagerly grasped the opportunity -- nay , the obligation -- to consider and repudiate it			0
" some of @entity25 's supporters argue that some federal prosecutions are novel and the penalties are often more harsh , creating conflict and confusion with local efforts to ensure public safety			1
they see @entity25 as an unexpected hero in the fight to return " the power back to the people			2
" " the proposition that the @entity243 is a trump card that defeats all of the remaining structural limitations on the federal government is not a proposition that is logically defensible , " sen. @entity239 , @entity240 , said when the case was argued in december			1
@entity25 had won an earlier @entity2 appeal , with a unanimous ruling she had " standing , " or legal authority , to pursue her claims in the courts			0
that allowed her to continue trying to have her federal conviction tossed out , which was the current issue before the justices			1
her lawyers say she had been trying in recent years to repair her shaken marriage , and has come to terms with her husband 's betrayal			2
the case is @entity25 v. @entity157 ( 12 - 158 ) .			2

@entity13 challenged her conviction on a federal chemical weapon charge
she used poisons to try to get back at a woman who had an *affair* with her husband
the case touches on the conflict between federal and state powers
