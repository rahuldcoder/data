-- @entity1 does n't get as many angry reactions to her work as she used to			0
for over ten years she has been one of the @entity4 only science writers in a national newspaper , and during that time received her fair share of disparaging comments from readers in the devoutly @entity12 country			1
yet as the curator of @entity14 , the @entity4 first modern , purpose - built science museum , her work now is a lot more palpable and potentially contentious than her newspaper column			1
" so far i 've had a few individuals with their own personal opinions on why we 're not showing @entity21 at the same time we 're showing the atom or beginning of the universe , " she said			0
" we explain that would be illogical in a science museum and they kind of concede and understand			1
or at least i think they do			0
" after five years of planning , the 8,000 square meter purpose - built museum opened last month in an upscale , redeveloped area of @entity32 that would not look out of place in @entity34 or @entity35			2
divided into five interlinked galleries , from " @entity38 " all the way to " @entity40 " and everything in between ( described by @entity42 as " nature in scale " ) , the aim is to make science more accessible and inspiring to a new generation			2
around 60 % of children in the @entity4 enroll in high school , but just 1 % of those in their final year receive qualifications in math and physics , according to a 2008 report from the @entity54			1
" it 's not secret , the @entity4 public largely perceive science as very cold and should be left in labs , but science is too important to leave to scientists alone , " said @entity42			1
" in terms of concepts i made sure they are very fundamental			2
if we show nano - tech right away without telling the public that everything is made up of atoms they wo n't really get it			2
" @entity42 's concepts were turned into 250 exhibits made by local artists in consultation with scientists			1
the fusion of art and science came with its own unique dynamic			0
" i always told the artists making the exhibits ' you have to be correct first before you can be beautiful			1
' " one artist wanted to move @entity84 to the other side of the @entity86 because he thought it looked lonely , while the hominids were made through email correspondence with a paleoanthropologist in @entity90 ; the world 's three recognized makers of cavemen were too expensive to bring in			0
the result is a lively , interactive museum with touches of @entity42 's humor			1
regularly displayed around the museum 's open - plan two - floor interior are signs reminding visitors to read the signs : " @entity103 is what makes humans unique			0
please help us prove this every day			0
" @entity109 - sounding museum guides have been rebranded as " @entity110 " ( " the coolest geeks in town , " says @entity42 ) whose job is to explain exhibits like the hominids and answer questions from the public			2
" what surprised me was the surprise of the public that evolution makes sense , " said @entity42			0
" when our mind movers tell visitors about evolution they do understand and will say , ' that 's it ? ' it is a big challenge , but it 's not that our people are so unaccepting			0
" send in your images and video from the @entity4 raising money for a shiny new science museum in a country where over 30 % of the population lives below the poverty line was another challenge			1
with no government funding , the not - for - profit operation enlisted the support of foundations and backing from businesses to raise the 1 billion pesos ( $ 23.5 million ) for the cost of the project			0
" we were so new to fund - raising and that we did n't really realize we were asking for such huge amounts , " said @entity145 , the @entity14 's director			2
together @entity145 and @entity42 make up the odd couple of popular science -- " i make the money , she spends it , " quips the laconic @entity145 -- and while @entity42 has devoted her life to science , @entity145 is as well - versed in the gospels as he is corporate life			0
he holds a masters degree in theology and was the @entity161 president of @entity163 food corporation @entity162 for @entity161 until 2000			0
compared to @entity42 , he takes a more charitable view of the teaching of science in the @entity4 but realizes more needs to be done to inspire the next @entity167			1
" ( @entity4 students ) do n't score that well in sciences , we are one of the lowest internationally , and while we do n't think the science museum will help solve that problem we think it 's a step in the right direction			1
" we do want to make an impact and show that science is n't something that should threaten you but should excite you and hopefully inspire @entity4 to take up science , engineering , technology and be an inventor in the future			1

the @entity14 is the first modern science museum in the @entity4
houses 250 interactive exhibits made by local artists and scientists
challenge to popularize science and scientific ideas in devoutly @entity12 country
only 1 % of high school students in the @entity4 *graduate* with math and physics
