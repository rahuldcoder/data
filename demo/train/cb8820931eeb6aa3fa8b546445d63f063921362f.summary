@entity0 -- fifteen years after @entity5 , @entity6 died in a @entity8 car crash while being chased by the paparazzi , a @entity3 edition of the magazine closer has angered the @entity11 royal family by publishing topless pictures of her son 's wife @entity13			1
the pictures were taken while @entity5 's oldest son @entity16 and the @entity17 were staying at a private chateau in @entity19 , @entity3 , according to @entity20			1
a palace spokesman said their privacy had been invaded in a " grotesque and totally unjustifiable manner " adding : " the incident is reminiscent of the worst excesses of the press and paparazzi during the life of @entity5 , and all the more upsetting to @entity30 and @entity17 for being so			1
" @entity3 is famous for its strict attitude to privacy -- the nation only found out about former president @entity35 's second family just before he died -- so why have the images appeared in @entity3 ? @entity1 examines some of the key questions about privacy			1
does n't @entity3 have some of the strictest privacy laws in the world ? " indeed it does , " says @entity41 , senior lecturer at @entity0 's @entity42			1
she explains that there is comprehensive protection for privacy , potential civil and criminal liability , and human rights protection under the @entity49			1
" photographs of private events and individuals can not legally be published without their consent , " she said			0
" the @entity54 states that ' everyone has the right to privacy ' and the courts have generally been strict in enforcing that right			1
the photographs should only have been published if they are in the public interest , or with consent			0
there is criminal liability for taking and transmitting photographs of private events without consent			0
" so how come the photos have been published there ? @entity67 says some organizations are willing to face the potential penalties , presumably hoping that fines will be lower than the massive increases in sales			1
" it is true that average fines have dropped in @entity3 in recent decades but image rights have been strengthening and there is a significant risk of this case reversing that trend , " she said			1
can @entity3 handle the truth on sex lives of rich and powerful ? how does @entity3 law differ from that in the @entity11 ? again , @entity85 explains that @entity3 law is stricter since privacy has constitutional protection			1
" the media have generally been more reluctant to publish private information ( including photographs ) than in the @entity11			2
" however , once photographs have been published then the harm has been done and it is much more difficult to obtain an injunction , so when media are willing to break the law and face the consequences it simply does not matter how strong the legal protection is for citizens ' rights			1
" does @entity102 law play a part ? yes			2
the @entity49 is incorporated into @entity3 law , just as it is in @entity11 law			1
article 8 says that everyone has the right to respect for private and family life , but article 10 protects the right of freedom of expression , although it also adds that the exercise of this freedom carries " duties and responsibilities			2
" in making a judgment about privacy infringements the @entity118 has to balance the two , with neither right taking automatic @entity123 interpretations of the convention 's provisions evolve through case law in each member state			1
earlier this year , key rulings in the @entity118 were welcomed by press freedom campaigners in the @entity11 as tipping the balance towards the right to free speech			0
can the royal family start proceedings under the @entity49 and if so how would they go about it ? yes it can , but as privacy expert @entity136 at @entity0 law firm @entity138 explains , it would first have to issue proceedings in the @entity3 courts , where the breach of privacy has taken place			1
" the national courts have a duty to enforce @entity146 , so if proceedings there did not provide an adequate remedy , and having exhausted the @entity3 appeal process , the @entity147 would then be able to appeal to the @entity118 who would rule on whether @entity3 had failed in its article 8 obligation , " she said			1
" this was the approach taken by former @entity156 racing chief @entity155 when he felt that the @entity11 courts had failed to protect his @entity146 8 rights by not imposing a duty to notify the subjects of tabloid stories before publication			2
" ( @entity155 won a privacy case against the now - defunct @entity164 after it published a story falsely alleging that he took part in a @entity168 - themed orgy			1
) @entity155 : can the press be free but responsible ? has anything changed since the death of @entity5 in 1997 ? @entity172 , the former chairman of the @entity11 @entity173 , told @entity1 he thought much had changed in the @entity11			0
" i do n't think the paparazzi are coming back with a vengeance , " he said			0
" in the @entity11 there are pretty strict rules about what is private ... but it does n't stop the paparazzi from selling to other markets			0
it 's difficult to police but that is n't an argument for not having some rules			2
" only last month , prince @entity16 's brother @entity185 was snapped naked at a party and the pictures were published in the @entity189 magazine @entity188			0
only one @entity11 tabloid , @entity192 newspaper , chose to publish the images			0
@entity172 rejected a comparison saying : " that 's a different case with different arguments			2
" what 's the likelihood of the photos being published by newspapers elsewhere in the @entity11 or around the world ? @entity136 said prevention would be very difficult			1
" in the @entity11 they would be able to get an injunction against publication , but realistically they wo n't be able to stop publication elsewhere , particularly in the @entity189 where the @entity208 is sacrosanct , " she said			2
" the photographs are also likely to become available online , which presents an enforcement nightmare			0
" she adds : " the photographs are so obviously private and indefensible ; it seems unimaginable that the major publishers in the @entity11 will decide to publish			2
the @entity11 press have typically shown a respect for the royal couple 's privacy , agreeing not to publish photographs taken on their honeymoon			2
unfortunately that wo n't stop the photos becoming available online			0
" this is a blatant breach which wo n't change the law , but it does highlight the inconsistencies in the approaches to privacy taken in different countries			1
what makes this so staggering is that publication has taken place in @entity3 , a country renowned for its strict privacy laws			1
" it is a view echoed by @entity235 , professor of journalism at @entity42 , @entity0 , and a former tabloid editor			0
he told the @entity239 he doubted any @entity11 newspaper or @entity11 - based magazine would dare to publish the images			0
" they quite clearly will be in breach of the editors ' code of practice which says you are not to photograph individuals in private places without their consent , and you would need to have a public interest reason for overcoming that and i ca n't see that there would be one			0
" he also said the @entity11 press risked a backlash from the public if they published them			0
" i have a feeling that there might be a bad reader reaction to obviously intrusive pictures			0
i may be misreading the public view here , but i think she 's quite a popular figure and the idea they might intrude in this fashion might lead to a boycott by readers , " he said			0
how has the royal family responded ? there is no doubting the anger within the @entity11 royal family			0
a statement from @entity147 said the couple have been " hugely saddened " by publication of the pictures			2
it added : " their @entity279 had every expectation of privacy in the remote house			0
it is unthinkable that anyone should take such photographs , let alone publish them			0
" officials acting on behalf of @entity287 are consulting with lawyers to consider what options may be available to @entity30 and @entity17			0
" how has the magazine closer reacted ? a statement on behalf of @entity20 @entity11 says the @entity11 publication is published by @entity294 but the @entity3 edition is published under a license by a different @entity298 business called @entity299			1
it adds : " closer magazine @entity11 was not offered any pictures of this nature and certainly has no intention of publishing the photographs of the @entity17 which have been published in @entity3 this morning			1
" @entity20 @entity11 takes its obligations under the @entity173 [ @entity173 ] @entity54 extremely seriously and would never publish topless images of a member of the royal family on its cover or otherwise			0

legal expert @entity41 : @entity3 law is stricter since privacy has constitutional protection
but she adds that average fines for infringement have dropped in @entity3 in recent decades
media lawyer @entity136 says preventing publication across the world would be very difficult
she said the case highlights the inconsistencies in the approaches to privacy taken in different countries
