-- @entity1 is back and ready to hit the stage			1
the crooner is gearing up for his " all @entity8 " @entity5 tour , which kicks off wednesday in @entity6 , @entity7			1
@entity0 caught up with @entity1 at @entity9 in @entity10 during the singer 's final rehearsals for the 19 - date tour			1
it 's there the music legend advised fans not to be fooled by the tour 's name			1
" if they 're waiting for all night long , let me tell you , i gave that up a long time ago , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
" i always used to say to them , all night long went all night long when ' @entity8 ' was out			1
now it 's down to a fierce 30 minutes , but if you want anything after that , i can pretty much guarantee an hour - 45 to two hours solid			2
" @entity1 promises the tour will be a mix of classic hits and fan favorites , ranging from his @entity31 days to his 2012 release , " @entity33			1
" to keep fans on their toes , the hit maker has a list of 14 songs to choose from each night			2
@entity1 compares planning out his shows to coaching a professional sports game			1
" it 's like going to a football game and you know the plays , " he said			2
" so when i call out a different play , they 'll go to it			2
" @entity1 's last album found him recreating his biggest hits as collaborations with some of country music 's top names			1
who does he want to jump on stage with him during this tour ? the list is extensive			1
come on @entity57 , where are you ? @entity60			2
i could do @entity61 any day of the week			2
i 'm sure these guys were in the @entity31 at some time			2
i just have to go back to see if their pictures were there , because they 're so familiar			0
the beautiful part about it is that the one thing they say to me when they meet me is , ' i know every song			0
' " with @entity57 confirmed to perform at the 2014 @entity75 halftime show , @entity1 has no doubts the 27 - year - old will do a great job			1
" my boy is going to kill it			0
are you kidding ? " @entity1 said			1
" listen , @entity57 is the real deal			0
and what i love about him the most is that he 's a songwriter			0
he 'll take care of business			0
" as a music industry veteran , @entity1 has some sage advice for those up - and - comers who resort to shock tactics when hitting the stage			1
" i 've always said this -- this is my little anecdote -- but once you start taking off your clothes , that means you 've got to have a hit record , " he said			0
" you 've got to back it up with something			0
my philosophy is -- i 'm the other way around			0
give me the hit record first and you do n't have to take off your clothes			0
taking off the clothes means , ' i need that hit record			0
' " the " @entity109 " singer admits he 's still surprised to see younger fans in the crowds at his concerts			0
" there are days i have to stop , blink , and turn around just for a moment to say , ' ok , that 's right , it has been that long , ' " @entity1 said			1
" there was the 21 - year - old in the front row when the @entity31 started and there 's the 21 - year - old in the front row now			0
" " the greatest thrill of this to me is what started out to be just , ' can we meet some girls on campus at the university ? ' ended up being a career , and the songs still work			0
the music 's been around long enough where the next generation is taking possession of it			0
