editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity18 , @entity19 ( @entity5 ) -- the town of @entity21 is 12,000 feet above sea level , nestled cozily in the vertiginous @entity19 andes			1
hill dwellers and mountain folk alike have had a reputation for hardiness and endurance ever since ancient @entity30 geographer @entity29 described the @entity32 people as a " tough bunch of customers			1
" being raised on the side of a cliff anywhere tends to favor the strong , sure - footed and stocky , and the environment of the @entity23 is a particularly punishing place to grow up			2
the slopes are craggy , storm - blasted and steep , and food is pretty much limited to potatoes and whatever animals you can chase up a 50 - grade incline without falling down the adjacent precipice			2
on top of that , altitude sickness generally kicks in around 8,000 feetâ € ” setting up house anywhere higher is pretty much relegating yourself to a semi-permanent hangover			0
maybe you see where i 'm going with this , but people in these hills sometimes get a little bit testy			2
just being a farmer here is like living your entire life getting ready to fight			0
regions across the @entity19 and @entity64 andes have traditional fighting festivals and ceremonies as an outlet for this type of mountain - born aggression			1
rules about who fights whom and what weapons you can use ( if any ) vary from place to place , but the general gist remains the same , as does the expected goal of social catharsis and the collective venting of pent - up steam			2
in @entity21 , the festival is known as @entity83 , everybody fights everybody , and it happens bright and early @entity86 morning			1
after a few days of preliminary drinking and dancing in costumes that combine the best aspects of traditional @entity23 horse - riding gear with the most nightmarish aspects of traditional acid trips , the residents of @entity21 wake up and head to the local bullfighting ring to beat each other silly			1
men , women , children , the elderly , the infirm and ( especially ) the inebriated -- they all pair off , wrap their bare hands with scarves , and give each other a friendly hug before walloping each other full - force in the face			2
while there are local referees with @entity112 - style whips to keep the fights from getting too one - sided and an entire crowd to rush in if anybody hits someone on the ground , the level of violence is still miles beyond what goes on in the average boxing or @entity121 ring			0
and often with good cause			0
the same rugged mountains that imbue the @entity124 with their sturdy physiques and penchant for hitting each other also separate the town from the rest of the country			0
the geographical department of @entity132 , for which @entity18 serves as the capital , is historically one of the poorest in @entity19 and cut off not only geographically from the power centers and financial interests of the @entity137 , but most resources and government services thereof			1
the @entity132 police force boasts a whopping three officers , and the nearest courthouse to @entity18 is a nauseating , 12 - hour car ride on the windiest , most rock - strewn @entity145 road this side of @entity149 's " @entity148			0
" the @entity19 legal system basically does n't extend into the hills of this region , so instead of packing into a van every time they 've got a beef with their neighbor , the residents of @entity132 save up their grievances all year then take justice into their own fists at @entity83			1
property disputes , stolen girlfriends , stolen boyfriends , stolen sheep , spilled beer -- all issues big and small fall within the bounds of @entity83 's physical jurisprudence			1
while not everyone fights over a serious legal matter -- the better part of combatants just do so for sport or because they 're drunk -- those who do so are bound by the results of the match and are generally satisfied by them win or lose ( although there have been occasional , impromptu " appeals " )			0
see the rest of @entity83 at @entity5 i went to last year 's @entity83 in @entity21 and the nearby village of @entity183 , where i met a legal student from @entity185 who 'd made the same tortuous trek as i had to watch the fighting			1
" the average villager in this region has basically no access to lawyers or courts , and even if they travel to a place where they do , odds are the ultimate judgment will not be in their favor			0
using violence as a means of solving disputes may seem barbaric to people in the cities , but as you can see , the fighting here is all carefully controlled and the people involved get an immediate and cathartic result , " he told me as we watched two teenage girls pounding each other 's visibly contused eye sockets with their bleeding fists			1
" i 've also found that what we 're witnessing right now holds closer to the true spirit of @entity216 common law than the @entity112 - influenced court system that the @entity218 brought over			0
" not exactly sure how accurate that is , but still , hell of a nice way to spend your @entity86 .			0

@entity83 is an event that gives people the chance to solve differences through fighting
@entity5 traveled to @entity21 , @entity19 , to examine @entity83 first - hand
regions across the @entity19 and @entity64 andes have traditional fighting festivals
