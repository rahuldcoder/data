-- although much attention is currently focused on the cases before the @entity7 @entity6 in which same - sex marriage advocates seek to change the definition of marriage , another longtime priority of their movement has been to add " sexual orientation " and " gender identity " as protected categories in federal civil rights laws , through the so - called " @entity11 " ( @entity11 )			1
here , " gender identity " refers not to one 's biological sex , but to whether one feels male or female			0
one concern about @entity11 is its impact on religious liberty			1
@entity11 would effectively forbid employers to consider sexual conduct in evaluating the character of their employees or applicants			1
although @entity11 contains a limited " religious exemption , " there remain serious questions as to whether any exemption would be adequate to meet the concerns of people with religious and moral scruples against homosexual conduct			1
however , focusing only on the religious exemption plays into the false assumption that religious or moral objections to homosexuality are the only reason why anyone objects to this law			1
what 's most significant about it may not be its impact on homosexual workers or religious employers , or the controversial insistence by @entity50 activists that it cover transgender people as well			2
what really matters is the ratcheting up of federal government interference in the free market			1
opinion : no one should be fired for being gay the basic claim of most of the advocates of @entity11 is that discrimination is wrong if based on factors " not relevant to job performance			1
" but again , the question is who decides what is " relevant to job performance " -- the individual employer , or the government ? the strong presumption should be in favor of the employer			0
of course , federal law already interferes with private employment decisions with regard to a few specific characteristics			0
the @entity76 bars discrimination based on " race , color , national origin , sex , and religion			2
" the first four of these are included largely because they are inborn , involuntary and immutable			0
while sexual attractions may be involuntary , neither sexual conduct nor transgender behavior meets any of these criteria			0
@entity11 would provide fertile new ground for employers to be hit by costly lawsuits as well , with disgruntled employees suing for " discrimination " over a characteristic ( in the case of sexual orientation ) which is not even visible and of which the employer may have been unaware			1
in the case of public employers , such laws at the local and state level have led to large settlements being paid at taxpayers ' expense			2
opinion : @entity7 is at a crossroads on gay rights even secular employers have reason to worry about a possible increase in sexualization of the workplace			2
there is an inherent contradiction in the arguments of the advocates of @entity11 , who contend that what they do in private has nothing to do with their work , but then also argue for the right to be " out of the closet " while at work			2
the gender identity provisions , meanwhile , undermine the right of employers to impose reasonable dress and grooming standards , by forbidding employers to use the most fundamental standard of all -- that people be dressed and groomed in a way that is culturally appropriate for their biological sex			0
@entity11 prepares the way for a form of reverse discrimination -- against anyone who expresses disapproval of homosexual behavior			1
the more open homosexuals become , the more people with traditional values will be forced to conceal their views			0
this can happen even if the employee 's views are expressed outside of work ( as happened to @entity151 's @entity150 , who was fired ) , and when no reference is made to sexual orientation ( as happened to the @entity154 of @entity156 's @entity155 , which was forbidden to speak about " family values " )			0
opinion : gay people live in 50 @entity160 often , social conservatives are accused of trying to " legislate morality			0
" yet @entity11 itself is fraught with moral significance			1
it would be an official government declaration that homosexual behavior is the equivalent of heterosexual behavior in every way , and that those who believe otherwise are " bigots			0
" a majority of @entity7 reject this view			0
( a poll taken by @entity176 in september 2012 showed that 52 % of @entity7 believe that " sex between two adults of the same gender " is " morally wrong , " and only 42 % say it is " morally acceptable			0
" ) @entity11 should be opposed by anyone who believes in freedom of speech , freedom of association , and a free market economy			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity187 .			2

@entity187 : @entity11 is fraught with moral and legal problems
@entity191 : @entity11 could provide fertile ground for employers to be hit by costly lawsuits
he says it would allow reverse discrimination against those who disapprove homosexuality
@entity191 : @entity11 should be opposed by anyone who want a free market economy
