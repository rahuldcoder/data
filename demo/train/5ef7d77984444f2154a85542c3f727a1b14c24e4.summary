the @entity1 's history of punishing players in domestic violence cases is as complicated as the legal cases themselves			1
sometimes players were suspended for a game or two			1
sometimes , charges were reduced , which also reduced the severity of the @entity1 punishment			1
sometimes , charges were dropped and players ' names were cleared			1
domestic violence now seems to be the football league 's no. 1 off - field issue			1
last month , the @entity1 announced a new policy against it			1
then , this week , running back @entity19 was released by the @entity20 and suspended indefinitely by the @entity1 on the same day a video showed him knocking out his future wife with a punch earlier this year			1
but the league has n't always been so assertive about the matter , one expert said			1
domestic violence accounts for 85 of the 713 arrests of @entity1 players since 2000 in a database compiled by @entity30			1
at a domestic violence summit in @entity34 about 15 years ago , " the @entity1 actually sent a representative who argued , ' are you kidding me ? they 're giving up two out of 16 paychecks for this issue			1
is n't that a significant enough penalty ? ' and back then , they would take that ( to the public )			1
today , it 's a different story , " said @entity42 , co-author of the 1998 book , " @entity44 : the criminals who play in the @entity1			1
" here 's how the @entity1 is handling or has handled punishment in some other cases : @entity50 ( @entity51 49ers ) three days after commissioner @entity52 created a new @entity1 policy against domestic violence on august 28 , @entity51 49ers defensive end @entity50 was arrested on an accusation of felony domestic violence			1
the new policy imposes a six - game unpaid ban for first - time offenders and up to a lifetime ban for second - time offenders			1
no charges have been filed in the incident involving @entity50 , and the case was still being investigated tuesday , said spokesman @entity67 of the @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70			1
@entity50 was arrested by @entity72 police at 2:45 a.m. at his house , where a party was being held for his approaching 30th birthday			2
@entity50 allegedly became involved in an altercation with his fiancee , who was 10 weeks ' pregnant , a police source told the @entity80 newspaper			2
several 49ers players attended the party , @entity82 affiliate @entity81 said			1
the fiancee showed police minor bruises on her neck and arms , the newspaper said			2
after @entity50 posted bail , he stated he could n't say much about the case			0
" the truth will come out , " he told @entity81			0
" everybody knows what kind of person i am ... a good - hearted person			1
" on tuesday , @entity51 49ers ceo @entity99 said the team was awaiting the outcome of the criminal case against @entity50 before determining whether to punish him			0
" i think it 's very important that we do let due process take its course , " @entity99 told @entity103			2
" i think it 's very important that we do n't judge somebody before , whether charges are filed or whether anything else happens			1
we want to make sure that everybody is afforded the right that i think @entity114 are afforded			0
" @entity115 ( @entity116 ) defensive end @entity115 was convicted in a bench trial this summer of assaulting his former girlfriend and threatening to kill her , both misdemeanors			0
@entity115 is appealing , and the @entity116 team said last month it would n't discipline him until his appeals are completed , @entity120 reported			0
the former girlfriend accused @entity115 of throwing her on a pile of guns and said he " bragged that all of those assault rifles were loaded , " her motion for a protection order said earlier this year , according to the @entity132 newspaper , which posted a copy of her request online			0
the woman said @entity115 picked her up , threw her into the bathroom , dragged her into the bedroom , choked her , picked her up again and " threw me onto a couch covered in assault rifles and / or shotguns , " her protection order request said , according to the @entity132			0
@entity115 threatened to shoot her if she went to the media or reported the assault , the court papers said , according to the @entity132			0
however , the @entity1 website cites an @entity147 account about 911 tapes revealing a different version of events			1
" @entity115 can be heard on a call saying : ' my assistant is trying to restrain her , and she 's trying to break free and hit me with her heel			2
i 'm literally running around the table right now			0
' @entity115 also alleges that the accuser could be on drugs , " @entity1 reported			1
some sports analysts are urging @entity52 to punish @entity115 : " with @entity115 , as with @entity19 , @entity52 needs to make a statement that the league has a zero - tolerance policy when it comes to how men in his league treat women , " @entity120 commentator @entity159 wrote			1
when asked about the criminal case against him in july , @entity115 said he disliked how it is a distraction			0
" i hate that i have distracted my team , " @entity115 said , according to @entity120			0
" other than that i ca n't answer that question			0
