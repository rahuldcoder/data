-- both @entity1 and @entity2 were rattled at the @entity3 on saturday but ultimately won their semifinals to set up a blockbuster			1
@entity1 saved four match points to inflict a devastating 4 - 6 7 - 5 7 - 6 ( 6 ) defeat on @entity9 teammate @entity8 at the @entity10 in @entity11 in easily the best match of a tournament that has featured an overflow of lopsided results			1
" i 'm very lucky , " @entity1 told the crowd			2
" @entity8 played better from the baseline			0
" @entity8 , now 0 - 11 on hard courts against @entity1 , will have to put the disappointment behind him as he 'll be on the same side as his more famous @entity21 in next week 's @entity9 final at @entity23			1
whereas @entity2 was n't happy with the crowd saturday in his 6 - 1 3 - 6 6 - 0 win over @entity26 , @entity1 was annoyed with @entity23 chair umpire @entity27			1
having the momentum after breaking @entity8 at love to end the second set , @entity1 thought he won the first point of the third set on his serve			1
but he apparently did n't hear @entity27 overrule a @entity8 ball originally called wide			0
when @entity8 earned the next two points , the score went to 0 - 40 when @entity1 thought it was 15 - 30			1
he aired his views to @entity27 but the score stood and @entity8 then broke			0
even more drama unfolded later			0
@entity1 saved three match points at 4 - 5 in the third on @entity8 's serve and another on his own serve at 5 - 6 in the tiebreaker before converting on his first chance			1
it was the third time he saved match points this year , the other occasions coming against @entity43 at the @entity44 and @entity45 in @entity46			2
a day after clinching the year - end no. 1 spot for the third time , meanwhile , @entity2 moved closer to another significant milestone at the @entity3			1
if he defeats @entity1 on sunday , the @entity51 would become the first man since @entity53 in 1987 to claim three consecutive titles at the elite year - end championships			2
@entity1 leads their rivalry 19 - 17 and triumphed in @entity46 but @entity2 has won 31 straight indoor matches			1
the 33 - year - old @entity1 also played for nearly three hours saturday and has significantly less time to recover			2
@entity2 would not have been the crowd favorite anyway , but his negative reaction when fans cheered a double fault in the second set against @entity26 might lose him more supporters			1
he replied by applauding sarcastically			0
" the crowd has a right to do what they want , to cheer for whoever they want , " @entity2 told reporters			0
" ( there were ) some individuals that were going over the line throughout the whole match , some provocations that i usually do n't react on , but i did			0
" it was my fault			0
" @entity26 had upended the world no. 1 at the @entity44 in the last four on a sweltering september day , but @entity2 gained his revenge with an easy win indoors at the @entity86 this month			1
the way saturday 's affair started -- that , too , was an indoor duel -- it looked like a repeat of the @entity93 tussle			0
the exciting @entity95 baseliner was hindered by a right wrist injury			0
@entity2 cruised in the first , needing a mere 22 minutes and dropping 11 points			1
when he broke in the first game of the second , this edition of the @entity3 was on course for an 11th straight - set result in 13 matches			2
@entity2 , however , double faulted for 1 - 1 and that was when the momentum shifted			1
@entity26 broke for 5 - 3 to the crowd 's approval with a winning forehand after @entity2 misplayed a smash and had his older rival in trouble to begin the third			1
" i allowed myself to be in that situation to lose the set , maybe even lose the match , " said @entity2			2
" generally it was my fault and i should know better			0
" facing the second of two break points in the first game , @entity2 almost double faulted when he struck a heavy second serve			2
later in the point , @entity26 misfired on a backhand down the line			0
it was the turning point of the set			0
djokovic immediately broke for 2 - 0 and coasted , with @entity26 double faulting on match point			1
" first couple points in the third set , i thought i had it , " said @entity26 , the first @entity129 man to reach a grand slam final			1
" i think i start thinking too much ( that ) he 's ( the ) no. 1 player , @entity2			2
i think i risked too much			0
" i think i did too many unforced errors first couple games			0
then he started playing better			0

@entity2 defeats @entity26 to reach the final at the @entity3
@entity2 drops his first set of the week but prevails 6 - 1 3 - 6 6 - 0 in about 90 minutes
he will face @entity1 in the final after @entity1 topped fellow @entity21 @entity8
@entity1 saves four match points as he improves to 11 - 0 versus @entity8 on hard courts
