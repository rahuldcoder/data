@entity0 , @entity1 -- if government prosecutors are right , a former top researcher at @entity4 is guilty of brazen scientific fraud - actions which a criminal complaint says have cost taxpayers nearly $ 15 million			1
federal prosecutors accuse @entity11 - born researcher dr. @entity10 of deliberately falsifying key blood research into a possible vaccine for @entity14			1
an indictment brought against @entity10 says he falsely showed that rabbits infected with the virus had shown remarkable improvement			0
that improvement was so advanced that the government 's @entity19 awarded @entity4 and @entity10 nearly $ 15 million in federal research grants			1
prosecutors say the false results actually cleared a first level of back - up testing but fell apart after @entity10 's boss at @entity4 began to get suspicious			2
according to the criminal complaint , the false results were secretly given to the @entity19 as well as a senior scientist at @entity4 after the first publication of the scientific paper			1
it was then , according to the complaint , that they discovered the rabbit blood was spiked with human antibodies , making it appear the rabbits were developing an immunity to the virus			0
a spokesman for @entity4 , @entity41 , told @entity2 that the school 's reaction was " disbelief , surprise , shock , disappointment			2
" in a letter attached to the complaint , and before he entered a plea of not guilty , @entity10 said he was " foolish , coward and not frank			0
" he added , " my misconduct is not done in order to hurt someone			0
" the @entity56 attorney for the southern district of @entity1 , @entity58 , told @entity2 that " just because somebody has a phd , just because someone 's involved in the scientific community , does n't mean they 're going to necessarily be treated differently than anyone else who 's committed a criminal offense			0
" as for the roughly $ 15 million in federal research grants handed out to @entity10 and @entity4 , most of it is gone , spent on salaries and lab gear , the spokesman said			1
the school did repay about $ 500,000			2
according to @entity73 , a group that tracks research fraud , scientists who fake research rarely go to prison and hardly ever are forced to pay taxpayers back for misused grants			2
in all , says a prominent scientist , the @entity19 has given about $ 58 million in funds to science that turned out to be phony over the past 22 years			1
dr. @entity83 , a scientist at the @entity84 , added up the numbers but cautioned the real number may be even higher			0
as for @entity10 , there was no answer at a @entity90 apartment building where he was believed to be staying until the trial			0
@entity2 did reach him on his cell phone , and when asked what happened , time and again he said only two words : " i 'm sorry			0
" if he 's found guilty on all the four federal charges against him , prosecutors say he faces up to 20 years in prison and a $ 1 million fine .			1
