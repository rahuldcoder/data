-- college basketball has a new record holder for most points in a game			1
last week , @entity5 , a 5 - foot , 10 - inch guard at @entity7 's @entity6 , scored 138 points to lead @entity6 to a 179 - 104 blowout win over @entity10 , a nearby @entity7 college			1
in setting his scoring record , @entity5 made 52 of 108 shots from the field , including 27 of 71 three - point attempts and shot 7 for 10 from the foul line			1
@entity5 's coach and teammates were happy to see him go all out			0
in the 36 minutes he played , @entity5 did not have a single assist			0
virtually every time he got the ball , he shot it			0
@entity5 is not the first basketball player to go on such an outsized scoring spree			1
on february 2 , 1954 , @entity23 , playing for tiny @entity24 in @entity25 , scored 113 points against @entity27 of @entity28			2
@entity23 made 38 of 70 shots and hit on 37 free throws in a game that ended with a 134 - 91 @entity24 victory			2
eleven days after @entity23 set his record , @entity34 of @entity35 in @entity36 poured in 100 points in a 149 - 95 victory over @entity39			1
no @entity41 player has ever done as well against a four - year college			1
@entity34 , who finished his senior year with a 41.7 scoring average , had a spectacular shooting night , hitting 41 of 66 field goal attempts and 18 of 22 free throws			0
in the @entity48 , the scoring record belongs to the @entity50 ' @entity49			1
fifty years ago , @entity51 put up 100 points in a march 2 , 1962 , game against the @entity53 , who were missing their starting center			1
@entity51 , who at 7 - foot - 1 towered over his opponents , was never much of an outside shooter , but his " @entity60 " was all he needed			0
he was unstoppable anywhere near the basket			0
@entity5 's scoring feat is , nonetheless , different from that of the others			0
they were playing in games in which their opponent was outclassed but still in their league			0
that was not the case in the @entity6 game			1
@entity6 is , to be sure , a small college , but @entity6 is far from any small college			1
like a series of elite @entity77 schools -- @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 -- @entity6 has an enormous endowment , a superb faculty and a national reputation			1
@entity10 's situation is very different			0
in contrast to @entity6 , which lists its undergraduate enrollment at 1,693 , @entity10 has just 302 undergraduates , and when it comes to endowment and facilities , the gap between the two colleges is even greater			1
@entity6 has an endowment of more than $ 1.5 billion and charges $ 41,004 in tuition and fees			2
all that @entity10 charges $ 14,478 in tuition and fees , and its endowment is listed in the @entity100 report as @entity101 ( not available )			0
@entity5 's scoring binge came against a college that does n't come close to having his college 's resources			1
what the basketball players at @entity10 must be feeling about losing by 75 points does n't seem to have entered anyone 's head at @entity6 or in the media , which could n't get enough of @entity5 in the days following his scoring feat. reporters barely mentioned the 70 points that @entity10 sophomore @entity114 totaled in a losing cause			1
i grew up in the @entity77 playing basketball at a prep school that often competed against tiny rural high schools to get ready for our games in an interstate league			0
when it came to running up the score , there was a code our coaches enforced			0
with a big lead , we slowed the game down			0
we stopped taking long shots that would get our supporters cheering , and with the game in hand , we brought in the second team , and after them , anyone still on the bench			2
when we left the gym , we wanted the other team to feel good about having played us			0
we did n't want their players hanging their heads in embarrassment , especially if we had a game scheduled with them for the following year			2
we knew these unspoken rules by 16			0
how could college players not know as much as we did as teenagers ? maybe it 's the times			2
but i wish that the @entity6 players had had my old coach , who doubled as my math teacher			1
coach would have made their ears burn for showing up an opponent as they did			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity161 .			2

a @entity6 player broke the record for most points in a game , with 138
@entity161 : the *achievement* came against a college team with far fewer resources
other players have had outsized scoring *performances* , he says , but those were different
@entity176 : players should have known better than to embarrass their opponents in this way
