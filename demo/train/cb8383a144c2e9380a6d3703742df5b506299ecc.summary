, the @entity6 leadership in the @entity7 allowed the clock to run out on protections that bill would have provided to millions of women across our country			1
it was an inexcusable failure by @entity7 @entity6 leaders and one that will have real - life implications for women who now find themselves with nowhere to turn for help			1
it was also another reminder , coming on the same day that @entity7 @entity6 leaders refused to pass aid to states ravaged by @entity25 , that these leaders continue to answer to the most radical elements of their party regardless of who or what is at stake			1
since it was passed into law in 1994 , the @entity4 has provided life - saving assistance to millions of women and families across the nation			1
for battered women , the law has provided critical law enforcement protections and often a way out from a life of abuse			2
one reason the law has worked so well in protecting a broad group of women is that since its initial passage , every time @entity46 has reauthorized the bill , we have done so in a bipartisan way that extends the legislation 's many protections to new groups of women			2
news : backers hope to revive @entity4 that was once again the case when the @entity1 took up the bill in 2012			2
we listened to advocates , law enforcement officers , clergy members and -- most importantly -- from the survivors themselves to find out what needed to be done to improve @entity4			0
and in april the @entity1 passed a @entity4 reauthorization by a vote of 68 to 31 , a rare bipartisan feat that included the support of 15 republicans			1
included in that bill were new protections granted to women who had been left out of previous versions of the bill			0
specifically , the bill included increased protections for women on college campuses across the nation following the brutal 2010 murder of @entity80 at the @entity81			0
it included new law enforcement measures to safeguard women on tribal reservations , one in three of whom will be raped in their lifetimes			0
it included nondiscrimination language for those in the @entity92 community who had been unfairly left out of previous bills			0
and it provided protections to immigrant women , regardless of their status , who are often scared into silence at the hands of their abusers			1
opinion : do n't gut @entity4 but for the leadership in the @entity7 , passing a bill with life - saving protections to these new communities of women was simply not politically acceptable			1
so just weeks after the @entity1 passed our bill , in a purely ideological move , @entity7 @entity6 passed a bill that specifically stripped the new protections for immigrants , the lgbt community and tribal women , and even removed protections that exist under current law			1
for me and for many of my women colleagues , as well as for mothers , sisters and daughters everywhere , the @entity7 @entity6 's decision to pointedly discriminate against these groups of women was stunning			1
surely , we should all be able to agree that where a person lives , their immigration status or who they love should not determine whether or not perpetrators of domestic violence toward them are brought to justice			0
surely no police officer should ever have to ask the sexual orientation or immigration status of a woman who lies bruised and battered at the scene of a crime			0
yet , the @entity7 bill drew those lines			1
debate over act centers on the vulnerable so , over the course of the past nine months , i have joined with domestic violence advocates , fellow legislators and countless victims to call on @entity7 leaders to end the discrimination against these populations of women			2
on the @entity1 floor we have told the painful stories these women have shared of being scared for their own lives			0
in television appearances , these brave women have plead for the protections so many other women across the country enjoy			0
and most recently , every @entity170 woman in the @entity1 wrote to the @entity167 to appeal for their help in passing our bill			0
opinion : sadly , some do n't see it as rape thankfully , in response to these many calls , one by one we heard from moderate @entity6 voices in the @entity7 who believed they should take up and pass the @entity1 bill			1
these members of @entity46 made clear that if @entity7 leadership would only bring up the bill for a vote it would pass the @entity7 and be sent to the president to become law			1
yet , throughout the final weeks , days and hours of the last @entity46 , house speaker @entity190 and @entity7 majority leader @entity191 refused to budge			0
ignoring voices in their own party and the clear message sent by @entity197 women in the last election , they instead decided to side with the far right wing of their party by allowing the bill to expire			2
this political gamesmanship has taken a very real toll			0
every moment the @entity7 continues to delay is another moment vulnerable women are left without protections they deserve			2
in the next @entity46 one of our absolute first priorities must be passing an inclusive and bipartisan bill to extend protections to the millions of new women included in the @entity1 bill			0
as a nation we can not accept further discrimination or delay from @entity7 @entity6 leaders			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity220 .			0

@entity220 : @entity7 @entity6 *stalled* *renewal* of @entity4

she says in partisan move , @entity7 then passed a bill stripping out new protections
