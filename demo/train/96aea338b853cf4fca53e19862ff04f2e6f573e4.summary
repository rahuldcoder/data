-- between 1.5 trillion and 2 trillion tons of ice in @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 have melted at an accelerating rate since 2003 , according to @entity7 scientists , in the latest signs of what they say is global warming			1
this image shows the changing rate of mass in mountain glaciers on the @entity16			0
using new satellite technology that measures changes in mass in mountain glaciers and ice sheets , @entity7 geophysicist @entity17 concluded that the losses amounted to enough water to fill the @entity25 21 times			1
" the ice tells us in a very real way how the climate is changing , " said @entity17 , who will present his findings this week at the @entity29 conference in @entity30 , @entity31			0
@entity7 's @entity37 , or @entity37 , mission uses two orbiting satellites to measure the " mass balance " of a glacier , or the net annual difference between ice accumulation and ice loss			2
" a few degrees of change [ in temperature ] can increase the amount of mass loss , and that contributes to sea level rise and changes in ocean current , " @entity17 said			2
the data reflects findings from @entity7 colleague @entity55 , who uses different satellite technology to observe changing ice volume in @entity2 , the @entity58 and @entity3			1
in the past five years , @entity2 has lost between 150 gigatons and 160 gigatons each year , ( one gigaton equals one billion tons ) or enough to raise global sea levels about .5 mm per year , said @entity55 , who will also present his findings at the conference this week			1
@entity37 measured that mountain glaciers in the @entity16 lost about 84 gigatons each year , about five times the average annual flow of the @entity65 through the @entity66 , according to @entity7			1
" every few extra inches of sea level have very significant economic impacts , because they change the sea level , increase flooding and storm damage , " said , @entity55 , @entity73			0
" it 's a warning sign			0
" melting ice , especially in @entity2 and the @entity58 , is also thought to contribute to global warming , @entity55 said			1
when the vast ice sheets and glaciers melt , they lose their reflective power , and instead , oceans and land absorb the heat , causing the @entity58 waters and the atmosphere to warm faster			0
" we 're seeing the impacts of global warming in many areas of our own lives , like agriculture , " @entity55 said			0
as an example , he cited the pine beetle infestation of this summer in the forests of @entity65 and western @entity95			0
" they were believed to be spreading because the winter was not cold enough to kill them , and that 's destroying forests , " he said			0
in the 1990s , @entity2 took in as much snow and water as it let out , @entity55 said			2
but now , about 15 years later , sea levels are rising about 50 percent faster , making the global climate situation even more unpredictable			1
" the best estimates are that sea levels will rise about 18 to 36 inches by the end of the century , but because of what 's going on and how fast things are changing , there 's a lot of uncertainty , " he said .			2

about 2 trillion tons of ice have melted in @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 since 2003
lost amount of water could fill up @entity25 21 times , @entity7 scientist says
most came from @entity2 , where losses raised global sea levels .5 mm annually
scientist says sea levels rising 50 percent faster than 15 years *ago*
