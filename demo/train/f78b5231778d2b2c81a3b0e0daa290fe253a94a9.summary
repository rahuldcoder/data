when federal safety investigators meet on tuesday to determine the cause of the @entity4 crash , they will have studied not only last summer 's deadly accident but also a little - known incident years earlier			1
in august of 2010 , @entity7 , one of the @entity9 's top test pilots , was descending into @entity11 's @entity10 when he leveled off to avoid another plane			2
to his surprise , his speed fell 10 or 15 knots below his target speed , even though he believed the jet 's automated speed control , or auto - throttle , was engaged			1
@entity7 pushed the throttle manually to increase the plane 's speed and landed safely			2
@entity7 , investigators believe , experienced the same type of " mode confusion " that caught @entity26 's pilots off guard -- at a much lower altitude -- shortly before they plowed into the sea wall at @entity30			1
in both cases , the pilots believed they had selected modes of autopilot and auto - throttle that would " wake up " the auto - throttle if necessary , much as a car 's cruise control kicks in when the car heads uphill			1
complex system there lies the big question before the @entity43 when it meets tuesday : is @entity44 to blame for creating a system so complicated that it befuddled even a top @entity9 test pilot ? are the pilots to blame for not understanding the intricacies of the system and for failing to monitor the plane 's speed ? or is @entity51 - based @entity26 to blame for not adequately training its pilots ? at a december hearing on the crash , experts told the safety board that while automation has vastly improved aviation safety , it has a flip side			1
the same technology that makes it possible for pilots to fly coast to coast without touching a yoke are complicated and hard to master			2
thus , flying is getting easier and harder at the same time			0
" automation can be extremely supportive of human operators if it is designed properly , " expert @entity67 of the @entity68 testified			2
" but we also have seen in a number of incidents ( where ) automation can actually get in the way			2
" " we have heard things like ' clumsy ' automation , where automation ... helps the most when the pilot actually might need the help the least			0
but when they need the help the most -- in very time - critical conditions -- it might be very difficult for them to actually operate the automation , " she said			1
different opinions not surprisingly , @entity26 , the pilots union , and @entity44 , which manufactured the 777 involved in the crash , have starkly different opinions of what role the pilots played in the crash , and the role of automation			1
" the airplane and all airplane systems were functioning as expected prior to impact and did not contribute to the accident , " @entity44 said in a march submission to the safety board			0
the accident was caused by the pilots ' failure to monitor and control the plane 's airspeed and direction , and could have been avoided if they had initiated a timely go - around			1
@entity26 , meanwhile , blamed @entity44 and the pilots			1
the pilots , just three months before the accident , had received " specific instruction " about the possibility the airspeed protection would be disabled in a certain mode , @entity26 said			1
the airline assigned blame to the pilots for not ensuring " a minimum safe airspeed , " and @entity44 for creating an autopilot system that led to an " unexpected disabling " of speed protections			1
the warning system , the airline says , also did not give the pilots enough time to recover			0
the @entity122 blamed crew training , saying pilots were not trained that a combination of autopilot and auto - throttle modes would not prevent the plane from going too slowly			1
" in this case , a key piece of information was not provided as part of the normal training program at @entity26 , " the union said			2
@entity44 said it was without fault			0
" all airplane systems were functioning as expected prior to impact and did not contribute to the accident , " it told the safety board			0
asked why the " hold " mode did not protect against dangerous drop - offs in speed , @entity44 told the board , " to do this would violate ( @entity44 's ) design philosophy : the pilot is the final authority for the operation of the airplane			0
" " if the auto - throttle automatically ( switched mode to prevent an aerodynamic stall ) , it would be overriding the crew 's selection , " @entity44 said			1
fly the plane manually if pilots are confused by the technology , there is a simple solution : fly the plane manually , @entity44 said			2
" this accident would have been avoided had the flight crew followed procedures and initiated a timely go - around , " @entity44 told the safety board			0
what no one contests is that by the time the plane 's captain recognized the plane was traveling too slowly , it was too late			0
at 11 seconds before impact , the plane 's low airspeed alert was triggered			0
eight seconds before impact , one of the pilots pushed the throttles forward			0
but it takes engines seven to eight seconds to spool up from idle to full power			0
the plane slammed into the seawall , ripping off the landing gear , the tail and both engines			0
it spun 330 degrees in a shower of sparks and debris			0
of the 307 people on board , three died			0
@entity26 fined $ 500,000 for failing to help families @entity26 crash victims sue @entity44			1

@entity43 votes tuesday on cause of 2013 @entity26 crash in @entity30
focus is on pilots ' actions , automation
pilots confused by auto - throttle modes
will blame fall on pilots or designers ?
