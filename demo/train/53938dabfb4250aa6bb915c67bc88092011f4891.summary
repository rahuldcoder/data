the headlines scream : " political tsunami , " " earthquake " and " big bang			0
" @entity5 elections may have taken place in 28 different countries , but the results in just one of them proved the big story of the night			1
who and what are we talking about ? @entity17 's @entity16 extreme - right party came top in @entity19 's @entity5 elections , with 25.41 % of the vote			1
this is a historic achievement for the 46 - year - old daughter of @entity23 , the party 's founder			1
and if the newspaper headlines are to be believed , the consequences of that particular vote are going to be felt for a very long time , both nationally and internationally			0
listening to @entity19 radio and television through the night , there was no doubt that @entity19 's whole political class and commentators had never thought such thing possible , at least not on that scale			1
some even succumbed to slight hysteria , live on @entity19 airwaves , including @entity38 , @entity19 's former minister for european affairs , who advocated , quite simply , a return to the @entity40 made only of its founding member states -- @entity19 , @entity42 , @entity43 , the @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 -- plus @entity47			1
from a union of 28 countries back to a " hardcore " of seven			0
a few days before the vote , in an open letter published both in @entity42 and @entity19 , in @entity52 and @entity53 , former president @entity51 proposed that @entity5 should be divided up into three zones , with an end to the @entity58 , which allows freedom of movement without passports between member states			2
it felt like panic ; it was panic			0
@entity66 's triumph reveals the collapse of national trust in the traditional right and left parties which have governed @entity19 for three generations since the beginning of the @entity72 in 1958			1
@entity51 's @entity74 party only managed to take 20.77 % of the vote , while president @entity77 's @entity76 only attracted 13.97 %			2
centrists at 9.81 % and greens with 8.89 % seem almost irrelevant			0
while president @entity77 has convened a crisis cabinet meeting at the @entity83 in order to prepare the next @entity86 meeting in @entity87 , a lot of people are left asking why a quarter of the @entity19 electorate cast their ballot in favor of the extreme right			2
exit polls carried out by @entity94 suggest that @entity96 sentiment is actually not the main reason			0
domestic concerns always loom large in @entity5 elections			2
only 22 % of @entity66 voters say that they want out of the @entity40 , according to the polls			0
the two main reasons cited are : " we need change " ( 43 % ) and " this is a protest against traditional parties of government " ( 37 %			0
) so , if this is not about @entity5 , after all , should president @entity77 dissolve the @entity107 , as @entity17 demanded ? should he resign ? two very unlikely scenarios but then , another question follows : what about the next presidential elections ? a poll conducted immediately after the results on sunday evening revealed that a majority of the @entity19 people wanted neither @entity77 nor @entity51 to run for presidency			1
a little like in @entity43 where @entity43 gave a vote of confidence to @entity119 ( a man who has never been in government , is still untainted , and therefore represents " change " ) @entity19 is in search of fresh and untarnished politicians whose names have never appeared in scandals of any sort			0
it is no surprise to see that @entity129 , the recently - appointed @entity19 prime minister , feeling still rather new in the job , is one the most popular politicians in @entity19			2
@entity17 , although belonging to a family dynasty and to @entity19 's political establishment , also benefits from popularity only enjoyed by politicians who have n't been tarnished by government			1
in other words , @entity19 voters want politics to be reinvented by a new generation			0
this , of course , may prove totally illusory , or the lightning bolt the @entity19 political class needs			1
