-- bright eyes , sparkling white teeth , big hair and barely covered breasts , these are the women whose gyrating hips bring a hint of glamor to @entity11 fields from @entity12 to @entity13			1
the antithesis of the man - mountains they cheer on from the side lines , cheerleaders are the apple pie served up alongside the rib - eye steak of the @entity11			1
" it 's entertainment , it 's @entity23 , its spectacle , " @entity20 , a past president of the @entity21 , told @entity0			0
the stop - start nature of @entity26 -- there are many breaks in play with games lasting up to three hours -- provides the opportunity for these pompom - wielding women to help keep fans ' eyes fixed on the field			0
" i think it 's everyone 's dream , if you 're a dancer , to pursue that passion at a professional level , " @entity36 , a 26 - year - old member of the @entity39 cheerleading squad , or @entity40 , told @entity0 ahead of a game against the @entity42 at @entity43 in october			1
" this is the time of my life that it worked out , it happened to be a dream that came true so it was a great next step in my dance career			0
" blog : @entity54 -- racist or sporting exception ? @entity36 and fellow @entity40 member @entity56 are paid by the @entity39 , but not enough to make a living , meaning cheerleading is combined with a career , full - time studies or balanced with family responsibilities			1
" we like to say it 's a part - time job , full - time commitment , " said @entity56 , who works as a nurse in schools , teaching kids about healthy living			1
cheerleading first came to the @entity11 in 1954 , when they were premiered by the @entity68 as part of the team 's marching band			1
the spectacle snowballed and now most self - respecting @entity11 franchises would n't be seen dead without cheerleaders -- 26 of the 32 current @entity11 franchises have squads			1
@entity56 and @entity36 have been dancing all their lives , taking the well - trodden path into the @entity11 through high - school and college dancing or by competing with a studio			1
" i had always danced growing up , so i thought maybe i would try out for the @entity39 to expand on my dance career , " said @entity56			1
" so i gave it a shot , i tried out and made it my first year which was very exciting			0
" the skimpy attire a cheerleader is required to wear is water off a duck 's back for two women with dancing backgrounds who work hard to sculpt and tone their bodies			0
" in the culture of the dance world , that 's just kind of the uniform , " said @entity36			2
" we need to be able to move and our bodies , our lines , need to be defined ... ( the uniform ) can be very sporty and be very flattering			0
" " of course , my grandma just loves our costume , " adds @entity56			2
" she thinks it 's the cutest darn thing ever and loves the sparkles on it			0
everyone has a different point of view			0
" blog : why the clocks never go back in @entity115 sport many cheerleaders also pride themselves on the work they do with their local communities , while some , like the @entity119 demand the women have public speaking skills as well as dance technique			2
but a harsher view of the cheerleading industry is that women dancing on the fringes of competitive sport is an echo from an age of sexism and misogyny			2
" when the whole essence of your job is basically hanging out in a tiny bikini and a bandeau top , it kind of undercuts the rest of your argument that you are a well - rounded person , " said @entity20 , who is also professor of media & sports at the @entity134			0
a video released by the @entity145 cheerleading squad showing women in bikinis dancing to @entity149 's blurred lines with the team 's mascot " td " arguably supports @entity20 's view			2
" it 's almost like in @entity157 , having the dancing girls doing the cancan while the guillotine is going down , " added @entity20 , who views cheerleading as accessorizing women			2
@entity36 and @entity56 remain undeterred and as cheerleading enters its seventh decade in the @entity11 , it shows no signs of kicking off its cowboy boots and calling it a day			1
" cheerleading has a long tradition in the majority of @entity115 sports at both professional and amateur levels , " @entity11 head of communications @entity168 told @entity0			1
" cheerleaders are part of american football culture from youth leagues to the @entity11 and are part of the game day experience for our fans			1
" the question of whether that culture is one that degrades women is one which hangs over cheerleaders like @entity36 and @entity56			1
blog : the naked truth -- how close is too close ? many negative stereotypes surround the cheerleaders , but @entity36 enjoys challenging people 's preconceptions			2
" i think that 's a big challenge of ours to overcome , " she said			0
" we take a lot of pride in our uniforms and we like to use them to represent the team			0
it 's part of our team spirit and part of the experience			2
" i feel that if we offer a classy and poised portrayal , then hopefully that is the way that it is received			0
like anything , it 's in the eye of the beholder			0
" while the integrity of individuals like @entity36 and @entity56 is unquestionable , @entity20 still feels cheerleading encourages people to judge women purely on their appearance			1
" they might be intelligent , grounded amazing women but we 're solely left to judge them by the outside packaging , which is getting skimpier and skimpier as cheerleading evolves in the @entity115			0
" if cheerleaders are necessary , why are there no cheerleaders for any women 's sports ? "			0
