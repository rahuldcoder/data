-- last august , then - @entity2 presidential nominee @entity1 introduced to the nation his surprise pick for vice president , @entity6 gov. @entity5			1
@entity6 gov. @entity5 has a strong base of supporters , as well as a steady supply of vocal critics			1
at the time , little was known about the fresh - faced , first - term governor , but within days , @entity5 's face was on newspapers , magazines and tabloids			1
since then , @entity5 has become a polarizing figure in the @entity2			1
her passionate supporters are countered with equally fervent critics			0
and even though it 's been nearly a year since she ventured onto the national stage and more than eight months since the @entity2 ticket lost the election , as @entity5 prepares to leave office , the public 's interest in her has yet to wane			1
@entity5 explains why she 's stepping down " she 's kind of a shooting star that caught fire and kept burning , " said @entity26 , an assistant editor for @entity27 and author of " trailblazer : an intimate biography of @entity5			1
" " when she walks into a room , she definitely commands attention and she gets more than most			0
she 's definitely a star , " said @entity26 , who was the only national journalist to have spent much time with @entity5 in the weeks before she was announced as @entity1 's running mate			1
@entity5 , a mother of five , " caught the imagination " of the public because there is no one else like her , @entity26 said			2
" particularly for conservative @entity45 , there has n't been a rallying figure of this type , " he noted			2
in the days leading up to @entity5 's debut speech at the @entity49 last september , @entity5 revealed that her 17 - year - old daughter @entity51 was pregnant			1
the announcement followed @entity54 rumors that @entity5 's 4 - month - old baby was actually @entity51 's			1
the instant fascination with @entity5 and her family was just a glimpse of what was to come			2
the public wanted to know everything it could about the @entity6 governor , whose resume also included beauty queen , high school basketball star , tv sportcaster and mayor of the small @entity6 town of @entity69			2
amid all the rumors and negative press , @entity5 showed herself to be a fierce attack dog and came out throwing punches in her speech at the @entity49			2
the self - described " hockey mom " tore into then - candidate @entity75 as two - faced , inexperienced and intoxicated by the sound of his own voice			0
even her critics recognized the spirit she brought to the @entity2			2
@entity5 continued to throw flames on the campaign trail , energizing her supporters and outraging her adversaries			2
" she yelled fire in a crowded theater			0
she really did , in some of her speeches -- ' palling around ' with terrorists and some of the other slurs she was hurling in the way of @entity75 and the @entity96 , " said @entity88 , a former @entity5 staffer and @entity6 journalist			1
" that turned off an equally big chunk of the @entity45 public that found it distasteful , destructive , divisive , mean and ignorant			0
whereas others said , ' @entity100 to go girl			0
you stick it to them , " he said			0
but @entity5 has n't always been such a divisive figure			1
before entering the national scene , @entity5 , who knocked out incumbent @entity2 @entity107 in the gubernatorial primary , was touted as one of the most popular governors in the country , with approval ratings nearing 90 percent			1
she was seen as a champion of ethics , determined to root out corruption and challenge the status quo			0
for those in @entity6 , @entity5 's reaganesque appeal was nothing new			1
she secured her role as a local hero back in 1982 when she led @entity123 's basketball team to a state championship			2
and in a small community like @entity69 , that was a big deal			0
alaskans liked her " combativeness and feistiness , " @entity26 said , and resurrected her nickname of " @entity129 " during her successful 1996 campaign to be @entity69 's mayor			2
but when @entity5 's " @entity129 " side hit the national stage , it was met with mixed reactions			1
@entity138 , the president of @entity139 , says @entity5 's potential is the driving force behind the public 's love - hate relationship with her			1
" that 's what people are drawn to , and that 's what actually threatens others			1
she definitely has the power to shake up a lot of old - school institutions			0
" said @entity153 , who has advised politicians			0
furthermore , @entity138 said , " i just do n't think people were ready for somebody so attractive and so fashionable and so hip to actually be campaigning			2
she falls out of the norm , " @entity138 added			0
but despite grumblings from some that they 're sick of hearing about her , stories about her continue to get a lot of attention			0
@entity26 said @entity27 magazine follows two politicians : " one is @entity75 , and one is @entity5 -- and then there 's everybody else			1
" from being dogged by ethics complaints , to her public fight with @entity174 ( the father of her grandson and ex-fiance of her daughter ) , to her recent announcement that she 's resigning this week as governor , @entity5 has maintained a steady presence in the public eye since stepping off the campaign trail			1
@entity183 , a columnist with the @entity184 , says @entity5 stirs excitement -- and hostility -- because " people want to see her even if they do n't like her			1
" he likens the public 's interest with her to " drinking on the sly			2
" people say , " i do n't want to do this , i know i should n't , but i do it anyway , " he said			0
some people love @entity5 , @entity88 said , because they can relate to her			1
" i think much of @entity45 said , ' oh gee look at her , she 's just like us			0
kind of dumb on some things , kind of smart on others			0
and not at all embarrassed to show all of her imperfections			0
' " but others saw her imperfections as inadequacies			0
some people love the simplistic approach to problems			0
others shake their heads and say , ' my @entity211 , you do n't get it			0
opponents have been quick to question @entity5 's intellectual chops , pointing to her spotty college career			1
@entity5 attended five colleges , graduating from the @entity217 with a communications degree in 1987			2
a series of botched national interviews did n't do much to disprove their point			0
but even @entity5 's critics admire her ability to connect with the people , @entity26 said			1
" i do n't think i 've ever really met anyone like that , except maybe @entity229 , that will have that interpersonal eye contact with you and will remember your name and your kids ' names , and make small talk with you and be really sincere about it , " he said			0
@entity26 predicted that while @entity5 might take a short break to recoup once she hands off power on sunday , " she 'll be back in the public eye			1
" " i do see her turning this to her advantage , " he said , noting that she 's made a similar move before			0
in 2004 , @entity5 stepped down as chair of the @entity246 after less than a year on the job , amid controversy over ethics allegations against another committee member			2
she turned that move around and used it as a launchpad to run for governor , because she went after the corruption going on in @entity6 at the time			2
" for me , i think she 's just catching her breath			0
she 's just too young to retire , " he added			0
" she did say 10 years ago she wanted to be president some day			0
she has n't backed off from that			0
" in @entity183 's opinion , @entity5 's career as an elected official is over , but he does n't expect @entity5 to be leaving the headlines anytime soon			1
" she 's gone from being our governor or a public figure in @entity6 to being a national celebrity , " he said			1
" it 's clear that her days of governor -- there are just a few of them left , but she 's really only at the beginning of her career as a celebrity			1
