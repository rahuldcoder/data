@entity1 , @entity0 -- seven emergency medics in @entity0 have been suspended from work for playing an internet game that involves being photographed lying down in unusual places			1
the lying down should be as public as possible and as many people as possible should be involved			0
bosses at a hospital in @entity10 , western @entity0 , were angered after photographs of the doctors and nurses lying face down on resuscitation trolleys , ward floors and an air ambulance helipad were posted on social networking site @entity19			1
the photographs have been removed from the site and the members of the hospital 's accident and emergency staff now face a disciplinary hearing			1
partipants in the " lying down game " must lie face down with the palms of their hands against their sides and the tips of their toes touching the ground			2
should the medics have been suspended ? send us your views there are two aims to the challenge : that the lying down should be as public as possible and that as many people as possible should be involved			2
but dr. @entity44 , medical director of @entity45 , was unamused by the alleged incident , which he said took place during a night shift last month			0
" this did not involve patients and we are satisfied that at no time was patient care compromised , " dr. @entity44 said in a statement			0
" @entity55 sets high standards for staff behaviour at all times and therefore takes any such breaches extremely seriously			0
it is important to reassure patients and our workforce that this was an isolated incident and staff cover was maintained at all times			0
" the allegations have been thoroughly investigated and seven members of staff remain suspended pending formal disciplinary hearings			1
