the @entity1 @entity0 announced recently that it is investigating 55 universities and colleges for their failure to properly handle sexual assault cases on campus			1
the list includes a number of prestigious institutions , including @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , the @entity15 , and my alma mater , @entity18 , where a 2008 university survey found that one in six women students had experienced nonconsensual sexual contact while enrolled			1
as a young alumnus , i feel a grim satisfaction at seeing my alma mater on the list			1
by the time i graduated , in 2009 , two of my close friends and one of my former roommates had been sexually assaulted during our four years on campus , and i had watched another friend go through the labyrinthine and largely ineffective student disciplinary process in an attempt to see her rapist held accountable			0
like so many other survivors of campus assault , she was discouraged from reporting to the police , and her case was instead handled internally , away from real law enforcement			2
this is , of course , part of the problem : if there 's no real punishment for sexual violence , assailants know they can get away with it , and survivors wo n't report it			1
and if survivors do n't report , universities can plead ignorance			1
when it came to sexual violence , it seemed that @entity18 's priorities were misplaced -- it was more interested in preserving the university 's reputation than ensuring the safety of the students			1
this is not to say that , within these institutions , there are not well - meaning individuals who work hard to keep students safe			0
but a few individuals can only do so much when they 're up against an institution whose primary goal seems to be to protect the university 's good name , even if that means providing cover for students who do terrible things			0
so far , @entity18 has not commented on the @entity0 's investigation			1
with so much at stake -- money , prestige and reputation -- on the line , it should not surprise us if @entity18 , like the 54 other institutions on the @entity0 's list ( and the numerous other at - fault schools , like @entity86 , that have , for now , avoided censure ) do their best to explain away accusations that for years , they 've allowed their students to get away with sexual assault or rape			1
one survey of two universities estimated that female students had a one in five chance of being sexually assaulted during their undergraduate years			2
by failing to protect their students and not properly disciplining assailants , universities are in violation of @entity99 of the 1972 @entity100			2
@entity99 , so often associated with athletic funding , also requires universities receiving federal funding to provide equal access to education for all students , regardless of gender			2
university administrators are falling short if they allow a culture of sexual violence to flourish			0
thanks to the tireless efforts of young activists -- like the students and recent graduates who founded the @entity116 campaign -- this issue is finally getting more attention			0
a new @entity120 task force has released policy recommendations for campuses ( and two star - studded psas ) and the @entity0 has stepped in			0
the @entity126 administration 's strong support for survivors of campus assault -- not just the usual platitudes and policy band - aids -- is a crucial step in the right direction			0
but other stakeholders -- namely alumni and parents -- need to join this fight as well			0
in june , alumni of all ages will be heading back to their alma maters for college reunions -- an exercise of school pride and , in many cases , hefty alumni donations			1
at @entity18 , the event is a three - day booze - soaked party of self - congratulation , and a chance to celebrate " the best damn place of all			1
" if alumni , in good conscience , want to wear school gear or stick school bumper stickers on their cars , they must take on the issue of campus sexual assault			1
to do that , they will need to speak the language that these institutions understand : money , and press			0
if alumni with the power to pull large donations refused to give money to their universities until sexual assault is taken seriously , we 'd see an immediate change on campuses			1
similarly , if parents were vocal about their concerns at sending their kids to a place where they might very well be assaulted or raped , or spend four years being covertly ( and overtly ) told that committing rape is acceptable , universities would scramble to improve and , more to the point , enforce , their policies			0
ultimately , efforts to prevent sexual violence on college campuses have to be motivated by something beyond a desire to protect a university 's bottom line , or to avoid negative press coverage			0
universities have to be motivated by the sincere belief that all students have a right to an education not marred by fear of violence or memory of violence , and by a deep and genuine investment in the safety of all students			0
as it stands , the words we hear from some of our nation 's top universities do n't match their actions			2
they have spent years letting down students , parents , and alumni , by making it easy for their students to commit assault or rape			2
it 's time to hold them accountable .			0

government will investigate 55 universities and colleges on sexual assault cases
@entity223 : as alumnus of @entity18 , which is among the list , i feel grim satisfaction
she says universities seem to care more about reputation than protection
@entity223 : alumni should hold donations if colleges do n't sexual assault more seriously
