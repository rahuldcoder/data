-- @entity3 @entity2 justices peppered attorneys with questions tuesday over whether an @entity7 inmate should be allowed to grow a beard as part of his religious faith			1
@entity11 , also known as @entity12 , is a muslim who filed a handwritten petition with the high court			1
he cited rights under the federal @entity18 , or @entity18			0
he wants to grow the beard as part of his religious faith and his attorneys claim he had offered to keep it to a " half - inch " as part of what @entity11 called a " compromise			1
" in their response , @entity7 corrections officials cited security concerns in their refusal to accommodate			1
justices to debate prisoner 's religious right to grow a beard according to the state of @entity7 , current policy allows only a " neatly trimmed mustache " and inmate beards could pose a security risk to guards and the public : prisoners who escape could shave their facial hair , altering their appearance			1
and weapons and other contraband could be hidden in heavy beards or inside their cheeks , covered by facial hair			0
justice @entity48 was skeptical : " as far as searching a beard is concerned : why ca n't the prison just give the inmate a comb and say comb your beard ? and if there 's anything in there -- if there 's a sim card in there or a revolver or anything else you think can be hidden in a half - inch beard , a tiny revolver -- it 'll fall out			2
" chief justice @entity67 addressed the issue of how to define " neatly trimmed			0
" " one of the difficult issues in a case like this is where to draw the line , " @entity67 said , addressing @entity11 's lawyer			1
" and you just say : ' well , we want to draw the line at a half - inch because that lets us win			0
' and the next day someone 's going to be here with 1 inch			0
administrative directive 98 - @entity81 of the @entity82 permits beards only for those " with a diagnosed dermatological problem			0
" but in his self - initiated plea to the justices , @entity11 complained that he and fellow @entity88 were forced " to either obey their religious beliefs and face disciplinary action on the one hand , or violate those beliefs in order to acquiesce " to the facial hair policy			1
@entity97 's original handwritten petition to the @entity2 ( @entity98 ) he cited the @entity99 -- literary traditions and sayings of the @entity102 -- which says , " @entity104 said , ' cut the mustaches short and leave the beard ( as it is )			2
' " @entity11 said he offered to keep his beard to a half - inch as a " compromise , " but that was rejected			1
forty states and the federal correctional system allow beards of varying lengths , say his attorneys			0
@entity11 is housed at the @entity115 , a 468 - bed , ultra-maximum security section of the correctional facility in @entity118 , @entity7 , near @entity119			1
officials point to inmate 129 - 616 's self - admission as a " @entity124 - trained @entity123 fundamentalist " with a violent criminal past			2
he had been indicted by a federal grand jury for threatening to harm then - president @entity128 's two daughters			0
a few years later , he was convicted in state court and sentenced to life in prison for breaking into the home of his ex-girlfriend and severely wounding her , slitting her throat and stabbing her in the chest			0
law enforcement officials say he threatened to wage " jihad " against anyone who helped convict him , both at trial and later behind bars			2
but @entity11 's lawyers say his criminal history is not at issue , but rather the state 's continued restrictive policies			1
" what they really seek is absolute deference to anything they say just because they say it , " attorney @entity147 told the justices at the start of the one - hour argument			2
" there may be deference to prison officials , but there must be concrete limits to that deference			2
" justice @entity164 questioned @entity11 's claim of a compromise in growing a trimmed beard			1
" let 's assume in the religion that requires polygamy -- could i say to the prison : ' i wo n't have three wives , just let me have two wives			0
' i mean , you 're still violating his religion , it seems to me , if he allows his beard to be clipped to one - half inch , is n't he ? " when @entity147 said the inmate should not be punished for being " reasonable " in his request , @entity164 shot back , " religious beliefs are n't reasonable			1
" state leaders had a simple message for the courts : allow us room to decide which restrictions work best within each institution 's unique circumstances			0
@entity191 , representing the state attorney general 's office , said " common sense " was applied in a reasonable way when the no - beards policy was enacted			0
but that brought tough questions from the bench			2
" you have no comparable rule about hair on one 's head , where it seems more could be hidden than in the beard , " said justice @entity206 , " where you hide something in a beard and it might drop out			2
" and justice @entity215 : " there 's no example , not a single example in any state , that allows beard policies where somebody did hide something in his beard , " a point the state conceded			2
@entity7 also argued growing facial hair could make it hard to identify inmates -- either behind bars or if they escape			1
alito again : " why is that so ? are you saying that somebody with or without a half - inch beard -- that 's a bigger difference than somebody who has longish hair , versus the same person with a shaved head ? " the @entity234 administration is backing @entity11			1
some legal analysts say the justices have traditionally been deferential to the security judgments of prison officers			0
the beard case is one of three high - profile disputes over religion that will be heard by the justices in coming weeks			1
one involves the ability of @entity3 born in the holy city of @entity245 to list " @entity249 " or " @entity250 " as their country of birth on @entity3 passports			0
another is a workplace discrimination claim filed by a female @entity123 woman from @entity254 who wears a hijab			0
she sued the clothing chain after a job was offered then rescinded -- she claims because of her headscarf			0
and the court will hear arguments over whether local governments can impose stricter regulations on temporary church signs than on other noncommercial displays , such as lost - dog posters and political campaign banners , typically displayed along streets in the weeks before an election			0
@entity11 is being defended in court by the @entity271 , the same nonprofit group that backed two @entity273 families in a separate high court challenge earlier this year			1
at issue there was whether a federal law permitted closely held family - owned corporations the discretion to deny contraception coverage in employer - funded insurance plans			0
the conservative court dealt a setback to the @entity284 and @entity286 supporters in the so - called @entity288 dispute , saying those with " sincerely held " religious beliefs had a limited right to operate in harmony with biblical principles while competing in a secular marketplace			0
the @entity271 noted that groups like the @entity295 and the @entity296 , along with catholic bishops , are now backing @entity11			1
the current @entity7 dispute is @entity11 v. @entity299 ( 13 - 6827 ) .			1
