" in a rare and unflinching interview with @entity0 , the man critics have dubbed " @entity73 " sounds off on religion , poverty , politics , health and family			1
" the thing i hope i have in common with the people out there is honesty , " he says			1
" i am not going to lie to the public or to anybody else			1
i got a pact with myself on that			1
" @entity0 : can we talk about your album " working in @entity15 " ? @entity1 : i 'm excited about it			1
there is a lot of interest			1
and i 'm out here trying to promote it			1
@entity0 : you do n't give many interviews			1
@entity1 : well , they 're worth more when you do ' em. @entity0 : the album is kind of a family affair			1
@entity99 ( his wife of 18 years ) is involved , and both of the younger children			1
@entity102 ( 19 ) is playing guitar throughout the album			1
the family aspect adds some appeal to it			2
@entity0 : @entity23 can sure play the guitar for someone so young			2
@entity1 : his mother knew more about it earlier than i did			1
she kept telling me that he could play if i would listen			2
one day he showed up and he knew how to play			2
i never watched him learn			2
he plays like an adult			2
@entity0 : is he very much like you ? @entity1 : he is much wiser than his father			1
@entity0 : you were raising some hell when you were his age			2
he hopefully wo n't have to do that			2
he has left that up to his father , i think			2
he has really got some words of wisdom every time you listen to him			2
he 's a fantastic boy			2
@entity0 : there 's a song on this album that keeps sticking with me called " what i hate			2
" @entity1 : there 's a lot of things i hate			1
it gave me a chance to vent what irritates me and also to turn around and say what i love			2
it is an interesting song			2
i like it best of all on the album			2
@entity0 : tell us the first couple of lines			2
@entity1 : ( sings ) " what i hate is a statesman speaking out of both sides of his mouth			1
" that 's the first line			2
@entity0 : do you think there 's a lot of that going on ? @entity1 : well , going into this election year , i would bet on it			1
( @entity161 ) @entity0 : have you been keeping track of what 's been going on in the presidential race ? @entity1 : i think an ex-convict has got a real good chance			1
i probably oughta run ! at least all of my past is aboveboard , and they wo n't have to spend a lot of money to run a make on me ! i think @entity173 will probably win the next race			2
@entity0 : ( president @entity175 ) @entity173 has certainly had his share of challenges in his administration			2
how do you think he 's done so far ? @entity1 : i do n't think it makes much difference who the president is			1
i think there was a big ball rolling before he came into the picture			2
he kind of did what i do			2
i did n't do anything			0
he has n't done anything that i can see that 's made any real difference			0
i think he is a fine gentleman , and they treated us real well when we were up there at the @entity195 ( @entity1 was a @entity195 honoree in 2010 ) , and i am not going to badmouth him			1
i think he has the next four years wrapped up			0
he has done some good			0
that is a real big plus			0
now on the home front , it is kind of fiddling while @entity201 burns			0
we are in trouble economically			0
i do n't think we can blame it all on one black man			0
i think we spent 50 years getting ourselves in trouble , and it may take a long time to get ourselves out of it			0
it is going to take more years than i got left			0
@entity0 : why do you think things have gotten so contentious ? @entity1 : when we left the gold standard , when we left the silver standard , when we started issuing notes and papers and trying to give everybody everything			1
@entity220 has had a helping hand in every part of the world			0
i think they are bringing those troops home because they ca n't afford it			0
they 've had no army to support			0
who are all the @entity231 going to borrow this money from ? they 're going to @entity227			0
@entity0 : you 've lived through some tough times			0
your family made a home out of a boxcar , and your dad passed away when you were 9			0
@entity1 : my father was a creative human being			1
he did n't have much formal education , but he was able to do things with his hands			0
he built everything inside of that boxcar and made a home out of it			0
built a cement step out front and a walkway out to the driveway			0
it looked just like a regular home			0
@entity0 : did you think you were a poor child growing up ? @entity1 : no. i was very well taken care of			1
we were poor , and when i could realize , i could see how poor we were			0
we lived paycheck to paycheck , and dad worked for the @entity262			0
i think he made in excess of 45 cents an hour			0
and he got 10 hours a day			0
i remember him coming home one day and saying they were going to cut the hours down to nine hours a day , and they were going to pay us the same money			0
that was the beginning of the big union influence in @entity220			0
@entity0 : when you hit success , what did that mean to you ? @entity1 : i am smart enough to know that i have been gifted and have had a better than average shot at everything			1
i have been blessed many times			0
i walk a blessed man 's path			0
i believe in the heavenly father , and if he is not there , then there is somebody disguising himself and answering my prayers			0
i am a deeply religious man , and i believe that if you give it half a shot , that he will help you			1
and he certainly has me			0
@entity0 : what are you praying for these days ? @entity1 : peace , harmony , health and the family			1
i pray for the children , and i pray over the food we eat			0
you know , our food 's been contaminated			0
it 's hard to find good water			0
and we say a prayer every now and then when we 're fixing to make a record			0
you probably would n't call us religious people if you saw us with a camera			0
you might not see what we 're doing			0
sometimes there is a prayer being mumbled under our breath			0
that is the way it is if someone had a reality show on us			0
@entity0 : is it a good time in your life ? @entity1 : i am real fortunate			1
i am going to be 75 , and i am able to walk around			1
i ai n't got no artificial hips			0
i got a bunch of false teeth in my mouth			0
but considering all where i have been with everything , and what i have been through , i am in real good condition			0
@entity0 : what are you going to do for your 75th birthday ? @entity1 : take a big breath ! ( @entity161 ) what 's it going to be like for the next three - quarters of a century ? it 'd be our luck they may extend the lifespan for another 150 years , you know .			1
