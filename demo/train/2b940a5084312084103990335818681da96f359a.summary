base to win the nomination and then reposition toward the center to lure the more moderate independent swing voters who are necessary to win the general election			0
@entity5 may be many things -- energetic , charismatic and geeky -- but no one familiar with his @entity16 conservative budgets would describe his selection as remotely moving to the center			2
just the opposite -- @entity4 has doubled down on his move to the right during the primary battle			2
what gives ? did the looming prospect of defeat push @entity4 into a desperate gamble ? give @entity4 some credit			2
he 's made a shrewd move			2
the @entity5 choice adopts a strategy premised on supermobilizing the base and luring a smidgeon of others			1
put on your thinking caps and grab an abacus , here are the numbers that could put @entity4 in the @entity39			0
conservatives outnumber liberals 2 to 1 ( 40 % to 21 % )			1
rage against @entity43 has the @entity44 ready to walk over red hot coals to cast a ballot			1
a mainstay of @entity49 's measure for determining who is likely to vote -- whether survey respondents are thinking a lot about the election -- shows not only that @entity44 are more attentive than @entity53 by 13 points but also more fired up than in recent presidential elections			1
to make sure they harvest the @entity5 enthusiasts , the @entity4 campaign appears to be assembling an impressive operation to turn out the vote and to aggressively compete with the @entity43 team for the early vote			1
what makes the @entity4 mobilization particularly threatening to @entity43 is that it targets his biggest challenge -- polls consistently show him ahead but there are ominous signs that a decisive group of those supporters wo n't actually cast a ballot			1
even with @entity43 's pro-immigration shift and the growing number of @entity75 in competitive states , their actual turnout may flag from their record numbers in 2008			1
less than half of @entity81 eligible to vote are registering and only 64 % of @entity81 say they will definitely vote as compared to their 77 % response in 2008 and the national average of 78 % today			0
the percentage of voters 18 to 29 who say they will definitely vote in november ( 58 % ) is currently running 20 points or more behind the national average today ( 78 % ) or the youth turnout in 2008 ( 78 % ) or 2004 ( 81 % )			0
blue collar voters -- never drawn to @entity43 ( think @entity91 in 2008 @entity53 primaries ) -- may desert him in numbers that approach the " @entity95 " defections in 1980			0
this possible weakness in the @entity53 coalition coincides with a bit more slippage among @entity43 's 2008 supporters ( 9 % ) than among @entity102 voters who wo n't vote @entity44 in november ( 5 % )			1
bottom line : by picking the bona fide conservative @entity5 , the @entity44 base is likely to deliver a rapturous response , which may allow @entity4 to succeed in exploiting @entity43 's greatest weakness at this point			1
before you conclude this is far - fetched , think back to @entity111 's strategy in 2004 to move right with strident social conservatism on abortion and same - sex marriage , steep tax cuts and hawkish policies in @entity117 and @entity118			0
embracing the base and scorning the rush to the middle cost @entity122 the independent vote			0
but @entity122 also supercharged conservatives and @entity44 , who turned out in droves			2
refuting the conventional wisdom that @entity53 do best in high - turnout elections , it was @entity122 who most benefited from the 16 % jump in the total vote			0
but -- there 's always a but			0
even as @entity5 fires up conservatives , he may also mobilize votes for @entity43 -- including senior citizens who reside in key swing states like @entity138			1
alarmed by his draconian proposals to remake @entity141 , they may boost their support of @entity43			0
another potential risk : a good number of voters may be primed to punish the incumbent for poor economic times			0
pluralities of @entity150 and @entity138 independents report that @entity43 's re-election would hurt their personal financial situation			2
but the coming hullabaloo over @entity5 's budget proposals may distract the economically pained from punishing @entity43			1
all in all , @entity4 has a tough battle ahead -- even stringent counts of @entity158 votes based on polls show @entity43 within striking distance of winning			1
but using @entity5 to ignite the @entity44 base is probably @entity4 's most plausible path to prevailing			1
and , it may produce a campaign focused a bit more on policy than on birth certificates , service records and the other side issues of recent elections			0
strap in , folks , 2012 may be much more interesting and close than we 'd imagined			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .			0

@entity178 : @entity4 was shrewd in picking @entity5 as his running mate
@entity176 : @entity5 can supercharge conservatives , who outnumber liberals 2 to 1
he says there are signs that @entity43 supporters wo n't actually cast a ballot
@entity176 : using @entity5 to ignite the @entity44 base is probably @entity4 's best chance of prevailing
