finding " the one " is a centuries - old quest ; but neither @entity3 nor @entity4 had to log in to an app to make a love connection , and @entity7 found @entity8 without ever having to swipe left			2
and though @entity9 certainly had their share of obstacles , losing a @entity14 connection was never one of them			2
dating in the digital era can be a rocky road , but in the forthcoming airing of " @entity21 , " @entity19 looks to redefine the road trip			1
in advance of the episode , here are a few street signs every traveler ought to take note of : before setting out on the heartbeat highway , one must lock in on the ideal travel companion			2
as @entity19 learns in a visit with dr. @entity32 -- a world renowned love expert -- determining who you 'll ultimately end up with comes down to identifying four main lanes , each of which is linked to a specific hormone : 1 ) " @entity40 , " a thrill seeker , linked to dopamine 2 ) " @entity43 , " a traditional calm thinker , linked to serotonin 3 ) " @entity46 , " a competitive and analytical thinker , linked to testosterone 4 ) " the negotiator , " the compassionate idealist , linked to estrogen " we are all made up of a unique combination of all four different styles of thinking -- but in different proportions			1
and this affects who is drawn to whom , " shares @entity19			1
" dr. @entity32 believes certain hormone dominant personalities compliment others			2
" the @entity63 is full of countless dating apps , but not all cars are comfortable to every driver			1
( if you 're looking for long - term love , steer clear of " @entity69			2
" ) before choosing which app to hitch your wagon to , navigate your way to @entity0 's handy " what dating app is right for you ? " flow chart , a go - to guideline that puts you in the drivers seat to love			1
far too often a given driver is guilty of not paying nearly enough attention to his or her journey , instead burying a pair of eyeballs in an @entity83 while a potential partner ends up in the rearview mirror like a missed exit			2
instead of texting , try talking , and actually engaging			2
you know , like @entity7 and @entity8 did			0
" i teach people how to meet people			0
what i 'm working to do is to get people you know off their phones and engaging with people , " says @entity92 , a self - described " social development coach			0
" while chucking the smartphone out the passenger side window is probably unrealistic , @entity92 says going lo - tech can heighten ones chances of truly connecting : " the ability to just be there present with another person is the thing that people are losing			0
" on a course as complicated as dating , there 's no reason to ride solo -- especially with so many experienced travelers available for assistance			1
as a part of thursday 's episode , @entity19 checks in with a professional " wingman , " several professional matchmaking services and multiple profile coaches , all of which boast an ability to keep daters on track			1
" we do the work for you			0
we meet everyone , " explains @entity125 , founder of matchmaking service " @entity127			0
" " when we find a great match , then we set you up on a date			0
" of course few singles are as outgoing and charismatic as @entity19 , so an online dating coach may be a better way of staying the course			1
in " money can buy you love -- or at least make you dateable , " @entity0 breaks down a collection of sites offering everything from assistance with profile writing to live dating advice			1
on a roadtrip of any length , falling asleep at the wheel is a cardinal sin ; cruising for companionship is no different			0
as the " @entity21 " explores individual landmarks this week , one constant theme remains : stay awake , and keep on coming			1
in visiting with " @entity149 , " one of the world 's premier dating sites , @entity19 learns of creating ones own path to a successful relationship : " @entity149 's philosophy is that you do n't need to wait for destiny to take its course when you could use a mathematical model instead to find your one true love			1
" in the same way a safe driver crunches the numbers on an odometer or fuel gauge , an @entity149 member deals with data in the form of a relatively simple algorithm : " we let people weigh an importance			0
so like if you really , really care about scary movies or whatever you could max it out or if you just do n't care then you could give it a zero basically , " details @entity173 , one of the site 's founders			0
" so the match percentage is actually really simple			0
there 's not like calculus or anything			0
" and whether it 's virtually online , through " @entity149 , " or literally on line , like in a local watering hole , the secret to success is keeping one 's foot on the proverbial pedal			0
behind the " @entity149 " curtain , it 's revealed that increased activity on the site -- posting photos , regularly checking in -- rewards users			0
meanwhile , at @entity19 's urging , the habitually single @entity196 steps outside of his comfort zone and buys someone a drink at a bar			1
" well that was nice ... there is an interest that is for sure , " he reports , furthering the notion that while being overly aggressive will cause you to crash and burn , a squeaky wheel will almost certainly get oiled first			0
" i had a real connection			0
" alas , the road to true love has forever been a complicated one , often full of twists and turns			1
but with @entity19 at the wheel , the latest episode of " @entity21 " ( airing thursday at 9 p.m. ) sets out to handle dating detours and lead even the most sour of relationship lemons out of their respective rut			1
more on dating in the digital age			1
