-- the election is over , and it has already become easy to forget the election administration lunacy that plagued many communities this year : long waits for voting , changing legal rules even while the election was under way , misprinted ballots , incorrect instructions given to voters , and various machine breakdowns			1
when close elections lead to recounts and jurisdictions undergo the legal equivalent of a proctology exam , the remarkable variety of maladies that plague the @entity16 electoral system are exposed			1
but when a candidate 's margin of victory exceeds the margin of litigation , we tend , as a nation , to rapidly develop electoral amnesia			2
we should n't need a @entity31 - style heart attack , though , to shock us out of complacency about an election system that fails in its most basic functions			1
the long lines of frustrated voters that have characterized the last three presidential elections reflect deep problems with our democracy and how we administer it			1
president @entity41 acknowledged as much in his acceptance speech when he thanked everyone who went to the polls			1
" whether you voted for the first time , or waited in line for a very long time -- by the way , we have to fix that ... , " he said			2
the country needs an election system governed by uniform rules administered with competence and political neutrality			1
until we get one , we will continue to trade one series of election problems for another as we stumble toward the next 2000 - style disaster			1
opinion : big money lost , but do n't be relieved the first problem is that we let openly partisan state and local officials run elections			2
political players , in other words , make the rules and referee the game			2
a state 's chief election official might even be the campaign chair for a candidate in an election she administers			2
every other democracy in the world has found some way to avoid this			0
partisan election administration may be the most deeply entrenched problem -- and the hardest to change			0
anyone who is now a statewide supervisor of elections was either elected or appointed by someone who was elected			0
the second , also uniquely @entity16 , problem is the extreme decentralization of our elections			0
we have no national election authority : states and counties are in charge of designing ballots , registering voters , adopting balloting technologies , allocating resources such as poll workers and voting machines and conducting the initial canvass of votes			1
to some extent , this decentralization can counter partisan manipulation at the state level by busting the monopoly one party might have over election administration			0
but it also leads to geographic variation in the quality of democracy that confronts voters on @entity110			0
election administration competes with many other things for attention and money , like schools , police and emergency assistance			0
and even when resources are not a problem , the sheer randomness of decisions made state by state and county by county lead to marked disparities in the election experience for voters			0
@entity128 : @entity129 routed by reality third , even with the best rules and technology , poorly trained volunteer poll workers are often not up to the task			1
they do yeoman 's work for our democracy and their service is largely thankless			0
but every election year , within hours of polls opening , internet message boards fill up with tales of workers wrongfully enforcing ( or failing to enforce ) the law , floundering with technology , or fitfully attempting to navigate the most basic aspects of verifying voter identity and handing out ballots			2
these combined dangers are further magnified by the fact that we have more democracy than anywhere else in the world			0
we vote for more offices and on more issues than citizens of any other country			0
it should come as no surprise , then , that a 10 - page ballot in @entity164 , for example , contributes to massive lines when it is added to the witches ' brew of manipulation , variation , and incompetence that define our elections			0
perhaps the line in the president 's speech was not a throwaway and reflects a real recognition that something must be done , despite dodging a bullet this election			1
the problems this year may not have determined the outcome of the presidential election , but you can be sure they are affecting the close elections for congressional seats and state and local offices			1
even apart from electoral outcomes , though , our system should be seen as an embarrassment each time we try to project our democratic values abroad			0
we should fix the system now before we have to perform the next autopsy on a national election gone horribly wrong			1
