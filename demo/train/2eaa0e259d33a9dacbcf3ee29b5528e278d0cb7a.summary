-- @entity1 wo n't be ready for consumers until fall , but that 's not stopping hardware makers from fighting to be first in line to build hardware for @entity9 's new operating system			2
@entity11 is planning to be the " first to market " with a @entity1 tablet , @entity10 reports			1
citing a " source , " the report says @entity11 is planning to be ready to ship the device in october and that it will have an @entity17 chip , so it clearly wo n't be a @entity19 - on - @entity20 device			1
other than that , there are n't any details on exactly what the machine will be , although given those basic criteria ( tablet , @entity17 , @entity19 8 ) , there 's at least one suspect : the @entity30			0
@entity11 showed off the yoga at @entity32 earlier this year , and it got a lot of attention due to its unusual form factor : a laptop with a keyboard that folds over completely to transform it into a tablet			0
@entity0 : how windows 8 tablets could challenge the ipod @entity43 had also said publicly that @entity44 would offer a tablet when @entity19 8 launches , and @entity47 recently confirmed months of speculation that it was working on a tablet as well			2
there have also been reports that @entity52 and @entity53 are working on @entity1 tablets as well			1
a key differentiator among @entity1 tablets will be whether they 're based on a traditional pc chip or one that uses the @entity20 architecture			1
while the new version of @entity19 has been engineered to be near - identical on both , @entity20 - based @entity19 devices are going to be " end - to - end " devices ( meaning @entity19 would come fully integrated ) and have a few special features , like an ultra-low - power mode			0
however , most legacy apps wo n't work on them			0
are you interested in @entity1 tablets ? what would you like to see in them ? let us know in the comments			2
