-- one by one , disasters have battered the @entity2 in recent years : @entity3 and @entity4 , horrific tornado outbreaks , the @entity6 and now a flood of biblical proportions on the @entity9			1
it 's as if @entity12 punishments have befallen the bayous , deltas and savannahs of a region that 's already scourged with staggering poverty			1
" we 're waiting for the locusts , " commented @entity18 , interim executive director of the @entity19			0
" at a certain point , you have to go : ' what else ? ' " within her group alone , the economic punch of this month 's expanding flood has put 10,000 hourly employees temporarily out of work at 16 shuttered casinos along the river , @entity18 said			1
@entity33 : damage map " all kidding aside , " she said , " it 's been pretty tough in this area over the past few years , but we just get up and keep going			2
" up and down the magnificent @entity9 , tales of hardship -- and at least one case of good fortune -- are emerging as the river is rising			1
flooding and other disasters are nothing new to the crawfishermen , casino workers , hotel housekeepers , barge skippers , watermen and other working - class individuals who make their living from the @entity9 and the @entity53			1
but so many problems coming so closely together are taking a toll			0
" what can we do to catch a break ? " asked @entity56 , director of the @entity57 and the @entity58 , based in @entity59 , @entity9			1
floodwaters on rise in @entity9 , @entity65 the 600 - acre facility , the nation 's 11th - busiest inland port moving as many as 14 million tons of bulk material a year , is closed because of flooding , bringing business to a halt , he said			1
" @entity59 's and @entity57 's economy has long been tied to the river , for 150 years or more , " @entity56 said			2
" because of fuel prices ... we had seen an increase in barge activity , but the problem now is the barges have nowhere to dock because the docks are underwater			0
" it 's not just riverbank commerce that has been paralyzed , @entity56 said			2
@entity85 flooding of roads has also forced many businesses to shut down , including 1,200 jobs at a paper mill and a manufacturer of shallow - water oil rigs , @entity56 said			2
" you know , the one thing about @entity9 and @entity93 , we are truly a resilient people , " @entity56 said			1
" after the event is over , we will rely once again on the river for our recovery			0
" what does cresting mean ? if there 's a welcome surprise in the slow - moving disaster that 's the great @entity9 flood of 2011 , it 's that the crawfish are now running heavy , said craw fisherman @entity106 , 41 , of @entity107 , @entity65			1
crawdads are so big in this part of the country that @entity65 accounts for 98 % of the country 's production , according to the @entity113			1
@entity106 has been exposed to crawfishing all his life , starting with his father			0
his dad was born on a house boat on a bay of the @entity119 , home to the nation 's largest river swamp and part of the @entity9 watershed			1
the basin is among the most culturally rich and ecologically varied regions in the country , and it 's home to the @entity129 culture			1
with a thick accent steeped in the region , @entity106 considers himself a @entity129 and speaks a little @entity132 though he ca n't keep up with the old timers , he said			1
@entity106 has been fishing for crawdads for 21 years , a skill he learned from his fisherman father , he said			2
for now , the flood has pushed so much water -- and oxygen -- down the river that crawfish are growing fast and eating well , @entity106 said			0
that translates to a good catch in his traps			0
but the rising waters have forced @entity146 to string the crawfish traps to higher tree branches , he said			0
so he has to motor his 19 - foot skiff closer to the tall branches and stand atop the catwalk on his boat to tether the traps to the tall trees among the flooded banks , he said			0
it 's worth the extra work , he said			2
he 's now harvesting 50 to 60 sacks a day of crawfish , or 700 to 1,000 pounds , he said			2
" the crawfish is going to run heavy , but it 's a hectic situation , " said @entity106 , who 's also vice president of the @entity160 , which has 400 to 500 members			2
" we have to cut a lot of the branches and the trees			0
you have to add strings to the cages , and with every day the water rises , you have to raise the strings higher in the tree			0
" if this pace continues , he can meet the typical annual income of $ 30,000 to $ 50,000 , minus up to 35 % in expenses such as bait , gas and motor parts , he said			0
" you see , we 're like farmers , " @entity106 said			0
" you got to make hay while the sun is shining			0
" the flood does pose one big threat to him and other craw fishermen			2
if the water breaches the levees and floods roads , markets will close and trucks wo n't be able to transport the bounty to consumers , he said			0
" we 're keeping our fingers crossed that it 's going to stay within the levees , " @entity106 said			0
" and that 's going to be a real big if			1
" how the @entity9 levees could fail the other peril facing the fishermen is old timber			1
past hurricanes such as @entity205 in 2008 felled many trees along the river , and the timber has since been lodged along the banks , said @entity209 , director of the @entity113			0
the flooding @entity9 will likely dislodge a lot of that wood , and " it 's going to act as 10,000 - pound battering rams floating down the river , " @entity209 said			1
@entity106 , a tough @entity129 who skins farm alligators in the off - season , said he 's prepared for all seasons , come what may			1
" the craw fishermen , we 're hard working people , " @entity106 said			0
" we 're a resilient people			1
we 're not lazy people , you know what i 'm saying			0

the @entity2 has been *pummeled* by big disasters caused by nature and man
this month 's flooding on the @entity9 has rendered many residents *jobless*
but , as one @entity129 fisherman says , @entity232 are " a resilient people "
