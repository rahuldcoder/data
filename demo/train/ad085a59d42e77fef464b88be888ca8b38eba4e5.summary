-- one dead politician in a tiny @entity3 country and now , six years on , the quest for justice in his assassination divides a people and could add to regional instability			0
a @entity10 - backed special tribunal issued indictments thursday for four members of the @entity16 militant @entity14 movement in the assassination of former @entity19 prime minister @entity18 , said a high - placed source in the @entity19 army			1
@entity18 's family and friends expressed relief , greeting each other with " mabrouk , " the @entity28 word for congratulations			1
for the first time in the recent and turbulent history of the region , an internal body was demanding accountability for a political assassination			0
there have been many in @entity19 's past , and so many killers have escaped unpunished			2
but not everyone was welcoming of the tribunal and the fallout of these indictments and ensuing trial , likely to be held in absentia , is sure to ripple through the region for months to come			1
in a stable and transparent nation , indictments in the assassination of a national leader would be embraced			0
but @entity19 has endured sectarian war for decades and analysts feared that it could see more @entity54 - @entity16 bloodshed in the future			2
@entity14 and @entity56 -- which along with @entity57 is @entity14 's biggest supporter -- have repeatedly denied any role in the @entity18 assassination			1
many @entity19 , however , believe @entity61 also played a role and a @entity10 source said thursday the tribunal could also indict @entity56 citizens			2
president @entity66 , already under global scrutiny for his regime 's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators , could come under intensified pressure , said @entity72 , an adjunct fellow at the @entity73 who has been working on a project on @entity14 in @entity19			1
" this could present a whole other level of instability and international problems for the @entity56 regime , " he said			0
" this might give the @entity81 and @entity82 leverage for even tighter sanctions			0
@entity86 journalist @entity85 said the indictments come at a difficult time for @entity56 and @entity14			2
they make a bad situation even worse , he said			0
" i think the @entity56 regime is facing an existential crisis , one i believe it will lose , " said @entity85 , author of " @entity91 : an eyewitness account of @entity19 's @entity95			2
" " so the indictments will only add to an already disastrous situation for the regime , " he said			0
" however , the @entity99 government in @entity86 will have a tough domestic and international fight as it struggles to deal with the ( tribunal 's ) indictments , and @entity14 is facing enough worries with the situation in @entity56			1
" @entity18 , a wealthy entrepreneur turned politician , was killed in a february 2005 @entity86 bombing			2
his supporters say @entity18 stood up for @entity19 sovereignty and against @entity56 influence and for that , he paid the ultimate price			1
his death prompted mass protests known as the @entity115 that led to the withdrawal of @entity56 troops , in @entity19 for almost three decades			2
but @entity19 remained divided over the tribunal 's investigation			1
the @entity121 camp welcomed the probe ; @entity14 's @entity16 supporters denounced it			1
in anticipation of the indictments , @entity14 raged against the tribunal by saying the @entity81 sought to discredit @entity14 and that @entity127 was to blame for the assassination			1
@entity127 has denied that claim			0
@entity14 leader @entity130 also made it clear that the group would not tolerate accusations against its own			0
" we absolutely reject accusing any @entity14 member of the killing of @entity18 , " @entity130 said last year			1
" we will not accept any indictment to anyone in @entity14			0
" that 's a threat no one in @entity19 should take lightly , said @entity140 , managing director of the @entity141 and a former senior director for @entity144 affairs at the @entity145			2
he said @entity14 is the only militia in @entity19 that has not disarmed and it has not hesitated to intimidate people through violence			1
the indictments mean that the militant group will have to implement whatever strategy it has devised to avoid accountability for a horrific crime , @entity140 said			0
" this puts @entity14 's partners in government in a real bind , " @entity140 said			2
in a bind because in january , the rift over the tribunal prompted @entity14 to collapse the government of @entity161 , the slain leader 's son			1
@entity14 and its @entity99 allies now form a majority in @entity19 's @entity165			1
the @entity14 domination was seen as a huge comeback for @entity56 , which , said @entity140 , has never really accepted @entity19 as a sovereign state and has asserted its influence in @entity19 for years			1
the new prime minister , @entity170 , announced a new cabinet only this month and said thursday that the " delicate situation " @entity19 is experiencing " requires us to be wise " and avert civil strife			0
but @entity19 authorities , outmuscled by @entity14 's fighters , do not have the capability to arrest or deliver suspects for trial , said @entity85 , the @entity86 author			1
they must choose between whether to cooperate in the international justice process or stick by @entity14 , designated as a terrorist group by the @entity183			0
because @entity14 nor @entity56 -- if @entity56 are indicted -- will participate in the judicial process , it will be important for world powers to remain committed to the case , @entity140 said			0
" holding @entity14 and @entity56 accountable for this is not going to be easy ... so this will take a lot of will power by the international community			0
" otherwise , the ghost of a dead man could continue to haunt the @entity3 nation			0
@entity0 's @entity194 and @entity195 contributed to this report .			0
