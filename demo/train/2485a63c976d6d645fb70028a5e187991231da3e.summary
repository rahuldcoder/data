in what may be the epic battle of the summer , the @entity0 and republicans are assembling their armies and sharpening their bayonets for a political fight over the selling of @entity8			1
on one side is the @entity11 administration , which is preparing to carry out the president 's landmark health care reform law			1
it sees success directly linked to his legacy			0
on the other side are @entity19 , conservative groups , @entity21 governors and tea party affiliates			1
they are reading the latest polls and are determined to make the repeal or severe crippling of the @entity8 their top priority before the 2014 midterms			1
" it 's a very important battle and both sides are trying to come out on top , " said @entity28 , a @entity29 historian and @entity31 contributor			2
" the first stage was about whether this passes or not			0
... now the battle is over implementing it and there are all sorts of ways @entity21 are trying to cause problems			1
" @entity28 said @entity21 have been aggressively promoting the program 's problems in the past few weeks			1
" and the administration feels the pressure , " he said			2
the next phase of the fight for the @entity0 , according to administration officials , is a series of initiatives aimed at using social media , websites , on - the - ground efforts and targeting @entity55 speakers and young people in particular to convince as many uninsured as possible to buy insurance when it becomes available on october 1			1
" we 've got to make sure everybody has good health in this country , " president @entity11 told @entity60 's commencement ceremonies recently			2
" it 's not just good for you , it 's good for this country			0
so you 're going to have to spread the word to your fellow young people			0
" meanwhile , @entity21 are continuing to whittle away at the law 's impact and are hoping that @entity8 's failure could become a rallying cry			1
" it 's going to be an issue in the 2014 midterm elections , " said @entity74 , president and ceo of @entity76 , a conservative - leaning think tank and author of " @entity78 about @entity8			1
" " when 2014 comes and the percentage of @entity84 that have employer - based insurance find out they could lose their insurance and be dumped into an exchange there will be an uproar , " @entity74 said			1
here 's a glimpse into each side 's playbook and the tactics they hope will win : what the administration wants to dothis summer , the administration will launch several initiatives in its goal to sign up as many as seven million @entity84 over the next year			1
they will hit the @entity100			0
they plan to roll out @entity102 as the go - to site for those signing up for insurance under the law , leading up to open enrollment starting on october 1			1
they will take it to tv			0
the @entity111 will soon unleash a campaign to saturate the airwaves with ads pushing people to begin shopping for health care plans			1
they are making it easier to sign up			0
to make it easier for consumers to apply for coverage from private insurers under the @entity8 rules , the administration is touting a simplified online form that takes 21 pages and boils it down to three			1
they will target minorities and young people			0
these groups are some of those most affected by a lack of insurance			0
this strategy will leverage @entity55 language ads , public education and outreach campaigns targeting recent college graduates , young and diverse faces on its website and a heavy emphasis on digital media			0
they are claiming it will be cheaper			0
the @entity0 is pushing a recent surprise in @entity147 , where the cost of buying health insurance through the state 's exchanges -- as required by the @entity8 -- are coming in as much as half the price of what was initially expected			1
for instance , the state will charge an average of $ 304 a month for the cheapest silver - level plan in state - based exchanges next year			0
president touts @entity8 benefits for moms who will pay more under @entity8 ? young men what republicans want to dothe @entity21 will continue to beat the drum on just how bad @entity8 is for the country			1
they continue to keep it in the headlines			0
@entity0 @entity21 have voted 37 times to repeal the law and some critics have suggested it 's a waste of time			1
" well , while our goal is to repeal all of @entity8 , i would remind you that the president has signed into law seven different bills that repealed or defunded parts of that law			2
is it enough ? no. a full repeal is needed to keep this law from doing more damage to our economy and raising health care costs , " house speaker @entity184 , @entity185 , said at a recent press conference			2
they are linking @entity8 to the @entity195 scandal			2
leading republicans , such as senate minority leader @entity197 , @entity198 , have also suggested suspending implementation of @entity8 until an investigation in completed into the @entity195 's targeting of conservative groups			2
they are challenging it in the states			0
several states with @entity21 governors and legislatures have threatened not to establish the required insurance exchanges -- and giving up millions in federal subsidies in the process -- in an effort to derail @entity8			1
opinion : myths about @entity8 still , things are starting to get ugly			2
repeated requests by @entity217 for more money from @entity219 to implement the law have been denied			0
ranking @entity21 are now calling the agency 's inspector general to investigate whether health @entity223 violated appropriations and ethics rules when she reportedly tried to raise funds for @entity228 , an organization that is working to help put the @entity8 in place			1
those actions are now also under investigation by two congressional committees			0
the agency maintains she made " no fundraising requests to entities regulated by @entity217			0
" public has questions caught in the middle is the @entity84 public			2
a @entity242 poll in april showed 49 % of those surveyed did n't know how @entity8 would affect them and roughly 40 percent were unaware that the law was being carried out			2
" in our research looking at barriers faced by families accessing available public insurance for their kids we found that families were often very confused about the requirements and the processes for enrollment , " said @entity246 , a family physician , and professor at @entity249 of such programs as @entity251 and the @entity252			0
" we also found confusion among families who believed their child to be covered when the child was actually uninsured , and vice versa			0
" a majority of @entity84 said they opposed the nation 's new health care measure , three years after it became law , according to a @entity31 / @entity272 poll released monday			1
but looking deeper , the poll also indicated that more than a quarter of those who oppose the law said they did n't support it because it did n't go far enough .			0

the summer of 2013 will see both sides *square* off in efforts to sell or roll back @entity8
the administration is hoping to start signing up people for health plans october 1
@entity21 are working hard to cripple existing measures and halt new ones
many @entity84 are still confused , according to recent polling
