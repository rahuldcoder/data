-- he sports a " @entity3 " tattoo and has expressed a fascination with @entity5			0
meet @entity6 -- the new @entity7 manager who is proving a polarizing figure after his appointment by the struggling @entity11 club			1
as his right - wing sympathies come under intense scrutiny , @entity6 says he only wants to talk about football -- though his controversial views threaten to overshadow his job of trying to keep @entity7 in the top flight			1
" my life speaks for me so there is no need to speak any more about this situation because it is ridiculous and pathetic , " @entity6 , who quit as manager of @entity19 in @entity21 's third tier in february , told reporters			1
" i ca n't every two weeks , every two months , every 10 months answer the same questions that are not really in my area			0
" but he might have to -- and in fact did a day later to try to stop more questions about his past			0
in 2005 while playing for @entity32 , the club he supported as a boy , @entity6 told @entity35 news agency @entity34 , " i 'm a fascist , not a racist , " after making a straight - arm salute to @entity32 fans in a game against city rival @entity39			1
" @entity3 , " the @entity44 version of the nickname given to @entity5 , is branded on @entity6 's right arm and the @entity35 dictator is cited in his autobiography			1
@entity47 criticism @entity6 's appointment has already prompted @entity50 mp @entity49 to quit his post as @entity7 's vice-chairman and he is n't the only one dissatisfied with the @entity35 's hiring			1
a @entity47 page , entitled " @entity55 " has been set up and as of wednesday morning @entity50 time , had more than 4,000 " likes			0
" a miners ' association in the industrial north east of @entity21 region said it has written to @entity7 " demanding " the return of a banner at the club 's @entity64 " in protest of the decision to appoint the self - confessed fascist , @entity6			1
" @entity7 's stadium was formerly the site of a coal mine			1
" the appointment of @entity6 is a disgrace and a betrayal of all who fought and died in the fight against fascism , " @entity71 , general secretary of the @entity72 , said on its website			2
the criticism did n't stop there			0
in a comment posted on website @entity84 , an independent @entity7 supporters ' magazine , one reader wrote : " if he supports fascism then he should be sacked immediately			2
" such was the interest surrounding @entity6 's arrival at @entity7 , the site was overflowing with responses to the @entity35 's appointment			1
is @entity6 racist ? given @entity35 's former fascist leader @entity5 enacted anti-semitic laws and oversaw the deporting of thousands of @entity35 @entity97 to concentration and death camps , academic @entity94 disagreed with the feeling of other @entity7 fans that @entity6 's political stance should n't have mattered when the club sought a new manager			1
however as for @entity6 's claim that he was a fascist " but not a racist , " @entity94 acknowledged the 44 - year - old may not be wrong			1
@entity6 -- still adored at @entity108 , where he played for four years -- has attempted to quash suggestions he was a racist by claiming that two of his best friends during his playing career in @entity21 were black			2
" those who have called themselves fascists have had many different views , and they have often evolved over time , " said @entity94 , @entity114 at @entity115 in @entity116 and the author of " fascism : a very short introduction "			0
" fascists did not agree what fascism was , and academics ca n't agree , either			0
so in principle , @entity6 could be right , and certainly @entity35 fascism was less racist than @entity130			2
however the story in practice could be different			0
" these days , most people think that fascism does equal racism , rightly or wrongly , so one could argue that @entity6 is irresponsible , " @entity94 added			2
another academic , @entity136 , agreed that differences existed in the definition of fascism , particularly in the @entity50 and @entity35			0
he pointed out that a fascist group in @entity35 had participated in charity work for minorities			0
in @entity35 , @entity144 said , @entity6 's comment of " i am a fascist " would mean " many things			1
" " i believe in @entity6 not being a racist , " added @entity144 , who spent time " embedded " with @entity32 and @entity39 ultras for the book " @entity148 : the @entity150 , " co-authored by @entity151			2
" i also believe that a celebrity like him which has numerous fans in @entity35 and the @entity50 should commit publicly to fight racism in football , " said @entity144 , a lecturer at @entity152 in @entity153			0
fans back @entity35 after @entity6 quit @entity19 in february , the club 's former chief executive provided a graphic description of his management style			2
" @entity6 would chuck a hand grenade and i would do the repair work at the end , like the @entity169 , " said @entity165			0
@entity170 , a season - ticket holder for nearly 20 years and secretary of a @entity7 supporters ' association in @entity175 , said @entity6 should not have been hired due to his lack of managerial experience			1
though @entity19 was promoted from the fourth division as champion under @entity6 in 2012 , he lasted less than two seasons and resigned amid uncertainty involving the club 's ownership			2
he claimed , too , that a player had been sold behind his back			0
" it 's down to his footballing experience rather than anything to do with politics , " said @entity186			0
" i think he 's lacking in experience at the top level			0
" @entity193 , the 28 - year - old editor of the @entity7 website @entity195 , said : " he 's trying to be made out as an uber - fascist when he 's not			2
" in response to the question , " would you be happy if we appointed @entity6 ? " 61 % of respondents on the @entity195 website said yes			0
if @entity7 wins or draw at @entity202 in @entity6 's first game in charge sunday , much of the brouhaha surrounding him will dissipate , according to @entity206			1
@entity207 , from @entity7 's @entity210 supporters ' association , also said that the media was " trying to make something out of nothing			1
" and @entity214 , editor of website @entity216 and a radio broadcaster in @entity153 , wondered why @entity6 's past was n't as intensely examined when he was in charge of @entity19			1
@entity6 's forward play for @entity108 , including a stunning volley he struck against @entity222 in 2000 that is widely regarded as one of the greatest goals in @entity11 history , has n't been forgotten by @entity108 's supporters			1
" if you want to be consistent , have a front page when he 's played in this country and when he 's come to @entity19 , not just when he 's appointed manager of a @entity11 club , " said @entity214			0
when it comes to @entity6 , it seems , people will always agree to disagree .			0
