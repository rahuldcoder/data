-- in your lifetime , you will send thousands , maybe millions of online messages			2
but what if you could only send one more ? in @entity8 , where superstitions surrounding death are rife , new websites let internet users leave digital imprints even after they pass away			1
one service is called " @entity15 " and the idea is simple : you sign up and upload whatever you want -- be it secret photos , random thoughts , sensitive files , or final goodbyes			2
when you die , the website sends your data to people you 've chosen			2
@entity25 , the creator of the @entity15 , said he thought of the idea in 2010 , when he was on an extremely turbulent plane ride			2
" i had recently divorced -- and i realized i had a lot to say to my ex-wife , my son , and my parents , " he told @entity8 's @entity32			1
last week , during @entity8 's annual @entity35 to honor deceased ancestors , his website became a trending topic on @entity39 social media amid widespread reflection over the missing @entity42 airliner			1
" the @entity42 incident made us remember life is precious , " wrote one microblog user			2
" if one day , your life is coming to an abrupt end , will you have any regrets ? we should create online wills ; it 's emotional sustenance			2
" other microbloggers said the recent @entity57 railroad station terrorist attack and @entity59 market knife attack also made them consider signing up for the @entity15			2
@entity25 said his website now has 360,000 registered users			1
many have jobs that are dangerous or require constant traveling , and a great number are in their thirties or forties			0
according to @entity32 , over 28,000 online wills have been created in @entity69 province , where 14 @entity71 passengers are from			0
in another twist , employees at the @entity74 website said 31 people on the missing jet 's passenger list matched the names of its subscribers			1
but a spokesperson for the website told @entity0 no links have been confirmed , as many @entity39 people have the same names			0
virtual graves yet @entity15 is not the only @entity39 website that attempts to deal with death			1
one website called @entity93 , which says it has over three million users , lets users create online memorials by uploading images of their deceased ancestors , after which they can pay traditional tribute by lighting virtual incense or laying virtual flowers			1
another @entity39 memorial site calls itself a " virtual home " for dead spirits , and lets users pay blessings to anyone from princess @entity106 to @entity107			1
but the most melancholy may be the " @entity114 " project , by @entity39 social media user @entity112			0
since 2011 , @entity112 has run a popular microblog account where he reposts final messages from ordinary people who have passed away			1
so far , he has already compiled stories of over 1,500 deaths			0
after each story , thousands of users , many of them strangers , leave tributes and well wishes in the comments			1
a 30 - year - old reporter , dying of cancer , wrote in her last tweet , " the operation ended ... i could n't even have porridge or water for six days ... this is one of the greatest tortures i have experienced			0
" another user posted a suicide note			0
" i 'm depressed , so i 'm just going to die			0
do n't care too much			0
" over 294,000 people replied , many of them simply saying " rest in peace			0
" digital afterlives for today 's internet users , death raises a set of interesting new questions : what happens to our data when we 're gone ? will anyone save our imprint , or will our virtual lives fade into digital dust ? @entity112 said his goal is to honor the memory of the dead , no matter their stories			1
" when people die , digital information is their legacy , " said @entity112 in a @entity158 talk			1
" i 'm just doing the work of a monk performing a funeral rite			0
" in the end , services like @entity74 and " @entity114 " seem to say that even in death , we do n't have to be alone			1
on @entity112 's microblog , one final post , from a 17 - year - old @entity39 teen who ultimately died of cancer , was addressed to his younger sister			0
" please remember -- no matter how long you go without hearing from me , i will always give you faith , hope , and love			0
" @entity0 's @entity179 in @entity180 , and @entity181 interns @entity182 , @entity183 , and @entity184 contributed reporting .			0

in @entity8 , new websites let internet users leave digital imprints after death
" @entity74 " has 360,000 users , with many in their 30s and *40s*
other popular websites act as *public* memorials for the deceased
