-- @entity1 is looking to repeat the feat of golfing legend @entity3 as he defends his @entity5 title at @entity8 's @entity7 course this week			1
@entity9 won his first major title at @entity11 and will be looking for a rare double success in @entity13			1
@entity3 won both the 1950 and 1951 @entity14 with his initial victory at @entity11			0
only @entity16 , 25 years ago , has completed two wins in two years in the tournament since @entity3 's double triumph			1
@entity9 admits that the @entity11 precedent has been on his mind as he contemplates his title defense which begins thursday			1
" i 've allowed myself that thought for sure , " @entity9 told gathered reporters			1
" i feel like the @entity5 test suits me			1
" for me being defending champion , i do n't even like that word , defending , because it puts you already behind the eight ball			0
you do n't want to be out there being defensive at all			0
" @entity9 heads a strong @entity34 contingent , which also includes @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , all seeking an elusive first major			1
a keen football fan , he nonetheless rated their collective chances of success at @entity8 above that of @entity34 at the @entity46 in @entity47			1
" i would say there 's probably more chance of one of us winning the major than @entity34 winning the @entity46 potentially , " @entity9 said			2
" so sad to say , but			0
" " blind faith that @entity34 will get far in the tournament prevails , so we 'll see , " @entity9 added			2
@entity56 , runner - up to @entity9 last year , cruelly occupying that position for the sixth time at the @entity5 believes he is capable of another strong challenge despite indifferent form this year			1
" i feel as good about my game today as i have all year , " @entity56 said			2
" it 's not saying a lot , because i have n't played well all year , but last week was a good week for me			0
i started to slowly put it together			0
" his 11th placed finish at the @entity69 was his best of the season , but he went into last year 's @entity71 at @entity72 on a similar run and triumphed in style			0
masters winner @entity75 is also strongly tipped to challenge for his second major of the season , but believes @entity8 's domed greens will test his patience			2
" i would n't say unfair			0
i would just say they 're very difficult , " he said			0
" when i say unfriendly it 's because they 're trying to beat you , " he added			0
former world number one @entity84 is sitting out his second straight major as he rehabilitates after back surgery , with @entity89 @entity88 going into the week as the top - ranked player .			2
