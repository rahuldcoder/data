-- @entity2 's lead nuclear negotiator announced a tentative agreement was reached friday over the implementation of plan that requires @entity6 to limit its nuclear program , even as @entity9 officials described the talks as ongoing			1
the conflicting reports came as @entity2 wrapped up two days of talks in @entity13 with the @entity14 , the @entity9 , @entity15 and @entity16 over how put in place a deal that calls for @entity6 to limit its nuclear activities in exchange or a softening of sanctions that have crippled its economy			1
negotiators from both sides appeared to make progress , with @entity2 's lead negotiator -- @entity29 -- telling state - run @entity30 that the two sides reached a tentative deal			1
neither @entity29 nor the top negotiator for the six world powers detailed the agreement			0
if all sides accept the plan , an official announcement will be made within two weeks , @entity29 said , according to the official @entity40 news agency			1
but @entity9 officials say while progress has been made , the agreement still needs to be finalized			2
" the accurate description would be that they are ongoing			0
the negotiations are ongoing , " @entity44 spokeswoman @entity43 said during a briefing in @entity46			0
the nuclear deal struck in november has been widely hailed as a successful interim measure to stave off an unwanted conflict over @entity6 's nuclear program			0
but after initially celebrating a diplomatic success , @entity2 has reportedly lashed out at the @entity9 for making public a modified version of the agreement that they say does not reflect @entity6 's interpretation			1
late last month , @entity2 lawmakers drafted a bill that would force the government to enrich uranium up to 60 % if new sanctions are imposed , state media reported			1
the move came only days after bipartisan legislation was introduced in the @entity65 that would authorize new economic sanctions on @entity2 if it breaches an interim agreement to limit its nuclear program or fails to strike a final accord terminating those ambitions			1
on friday , the @entity65 moved toward a veto - proof majority supporting legislation authorizing new economic sanctions on @entity2			1
the bipartisan proposal introduced by @entity77 chairman sen. @entity76 , @entity78 , and sen. @entity79 , @entity80 , now has 59 senators who have formally committed to support it , a senior @entity65 aide told @entity0			0
the aide said that the current informal count is even higher -- at 77 yes votes -- and that more are expected to come on board once the undecided are forced to vote			0
a two - thirds majority in both the @entity65 and @entity87 is necessary to override a presidential veto			2
president @entity89 has threatened to veto any legislation that would authorize new economic sanctions on @entity2 , saying such a bill at this time would undermine delicate efforts to forge a lasting deal with @entity6			2
the bill could come to the @entity65 floor for consideration during the week of @entity89 's @entity98 on january 28 or the following week , said the aide , who spoke on condition of anonymity , citing the sensitivity of the issue			0
the proposal would give @entity89 more than a year to engage in further diplomacy before any new sanctions would kick in against @entity2 's oil exports and other key areas of its economy , but sanctions would hit sooner if @entity2 cheats on the interim deal or fails to reach a final accord			1
the @entity9 and other @entity115 powers believe @entity2 is attempting to build a bomb through uranium enrichment			2
but @entity6 says its nuclear intentions are peaceful			0
