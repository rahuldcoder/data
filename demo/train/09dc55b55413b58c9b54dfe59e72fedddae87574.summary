-- it 's a bright may morning and the purple - shirted army of tricycle drivers is on the streets of @entity5 once again			1
eyes trained ahead , they zip past traffic on their specially - modified vehicles , dipping in and out of the @entity11 megacity 's slums			1
this is the mobile division of @entity13 , an innovative enterprise using an incentive - based program to help solve @entity5 's acute waste management problem			1
every week , the company 's cyclists peddle from door to door in low - income neighborhoods to pick up recyclable trash from registered households			1
items like plastic bottles , aluminum cans and plastic sachets are all weighed and logged on site , and from there are taken to a specific sorting area where they 're bagged in order to be sold to recycling factories			0
in return , participating households receive points via sms			2
these can eventually be exchanged for rewards , mainly donated items ranging from bowls and blenders to food products and mobile phone air time			0
" every three months they have opportunity to redeem the points for something , " says @entity45 chief executive @entity44			0
" so we give them really small gifts that just motivate them and encourage them to recycle			2
" @entity5 , a sprawling megacity of more than 18 million people , generates a massive 10,000 metric tons of waste daily , according to the city 's waste management authority			1
only 40 % of it is believed to be formally collected , leaving large quantities of rubbish blocking gutters and piling up on streets and outside houses -- a major health and environmental hazard			0
" low income communities are the ones that are more affected , " says @entity44			0
" ( @entity69 ) end up living in their waste , so we basically saw that there was a really big need to provide collection services for people that are living in the low - income areas			1
" born and bred in @entity5 , @entity44 went to the @entity78 at the age of 17			2
there , she trained and worked as a computer scientist , before enrolling to @entity82 for a masters in business administration			0
it was during that time , while working on a study project focused on the problems faced by people in low - income areas , when she came up with the idea to launch a company offering waste collection and recycling services in her hometown			1
" i really love @entity5 and i wanted to do something that would give back to it , " says @entity44			2
" for me , the environment is really where it all starts , " she adds			0
" when you have a clean environment then you have health , when you have health then you can start thinking about money , jobs and things like that			0
" set up just a year and a half ago , @entity107 has grown today to have some 5,000 households subscribed to its service			2
the startup has so far collected nearly 300 tons of waste , using a fleet of 16 low - cost cargo bicycles that are creatively designed to transport large cloth sacks of trash			1
in regards to recycling as a business , however , there are still many challenges faced by @entity107 , which is yet to make a profit			0
" we hope that as we grow and add value to the material we sell , then we hope to see profits come in , " says @entity44 , who employs 31 people			0
despite the problems , the entrepreneur has big plans for the future			0
she says she 's determined to keep on working to expand the service across @entity5 and beyond and ultimately help to change people 's attitudes toward waste			1
" i want to show the whole world that this is something that can succeed , " says @entity44			0
" that we can create a low - cost way of solving the @entity11 problems , the @entity5 problems , here , with @entity5 solutions , " she adds			1
" to show that we can have ingenuity and innovation here and almost create a movement around waste and make people realize the importance of recycling and the environment -- i 'm already seeing that but i want to see it on a really big scale all across @entity11			1
