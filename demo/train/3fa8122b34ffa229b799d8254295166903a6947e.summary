-- what does it mean when a white sorority wins a competition that @entity6 fraternities and sororities not only created but also consider an essential part of their cultural expression ? it means an uncomfortable discussion about race , history , culture and inclusivity that is not black and white			1
on february 20 , the @entity17 chapter of @entity18 , a predominantly white sorority , won the inaugural @entity19 off stepping competition , beating two predominantly black sororities			1
stepping , which began in the 1960s , is a intricate rhythmic dance that features synchronized foot stomps , handclaps , choreographed movements and chants			0
the competition was fierce , and all of the competitors fought hard for the $ 100,000 first - place scholarship			0
but the results immediately sparked a firestorm within the @entity6 fraternal community , with many calling foul			1
how could a white sorority beat black sororities at our own art form ? why were they even competing in the first place ? some alleged that judges cheated , while others posited that the novelty of white women performing swayed the judges			1
to understand why this is a big deal , you have to understand that @entity6 fraternities and sororities are as close to the @entity53 stereotype attached to white fraternities as @entity55 is to hip - hop			1
black fraternities and sororities , known as the @entity59 , form the fiber of @entity6 leadership in this country and continue to produce the leaders of tomorrow			1
the nine predominantly @entity6 - @entity6 fraternities and sororities -- @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 -- were founded between 1906 and 1963 to support african - american college students in their quest not only to succeed on campus but to develop into college - educated leaders			1
the roster of @entity59 members is a @entity82 in @entity6 : the rev. @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and over a million others count themselves as members			2
the civil rights movement is populated with @entity59 members who developed leadership skills on college campuses			0
and the connection does n't end after graduation			0
@entity6 fraternal members spend thousand of hours doing service in alumni chapters , raising money for scholarships and mentoring at - risk people			1
pride in one 's organization is paramount to @entity59 members , and one way to express that is through stepping			0
@entity59 fraternities and sororities take great pride in being original and innovative in their dances : highly coordinated , with elaborate costumes , and sometimes performed before thousands			2
it 's a point of pride to perform , but to win for the glory of your fraternity or sorority is the ultimate			0
so when @entity18 members won the @entity120 , it was not just that they 'd beaten @entity6 sororities , it was seen as the first assault on yet another @entity6 cultural tradition that , if not guarded , would be appropriated from blacks like jazz and hip - hop			1
for many @entity6 , the notion of african - americans having a separate culture , uninfluenced by other @entity6 , makes them uncomfortable			1
is n't the point of civil rights to erase the color lines that separate and divide us ? and if we acknowledge that blacks have cultural traditions that have been nurtured within their own community , does that make blacks separate from whites ? this is where the nuances of race and culture come into play			2
blacks are keenly aware of their otherness in this country			0
we 're proud to be @entity6 yet also proud that we 've built strong traditions that have sustained us through turbulent times			2
so we zealously protect those traditions from interlopers who may want to exploit or denigrate what we cherish			0
but this is the very reason why any @entity6 who dismissed the @entity18 win , or even the sorority 's right to participate in the competition on the basis of being white , was 100 percent wrong			2
we as african - americans ca n't protect cultural expression by creating fences that exclude			2
but we can demand that anyone who seeks inclusion , and wants to participate in our culture , does so with the same respect and honor that we as @entity6 demand of ourselves			2
by all accounts , the women of @entity18 did just that			0
and even later , when @entity19 announced that @entity70 , the @entity6 - @entity6 sorority that had come in second , would also be awarded a first - place prize because of scoring irregularities , no one could dispute that in a subjective contest , @entity18 met the criteria for winning , regardless of skin color			1
and that 's something we as @entity59 members should remember as we continue to strive to eliminate racism and bias			0
we ca n't fall victim to the same rationale that still is used to deny us first - class citizenship			1
as the leaders of college campuses and in the community , we must always fight for equality and demand that we 're judged based on our skill			0
and if we do n't do that , we lose much more than a stepping contest			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194			0

@entity194 : @entity197 sorority won " step " contest , dance form of black frats and sororities
@entity194 : black fraternities , sororities are all about creating leaders ; step is proud tradition
many in @entity6 fraternal community cried foul , he writes
@entity194 warns against using same rationale that denies blacks first - class citizenship
