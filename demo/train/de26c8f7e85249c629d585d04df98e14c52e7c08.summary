-- the vetting process and the subsequent hiring of @entity4 ceo @entity3 seemed like standard procedure			1
but in recent days he has come under fire for the controversy surrounding his academic credentials			1
a graduate of @entity11 , @entity3 earned a bachelor 's degree in accounting			1
but his official biography at @entity4 and @entity15 , where he worked previously , says that he also has a degree in computer science			2
@entity3 probably could have gone further and claimed he had a master 's degree in engineering and no one would have questioned it			1
holding these credentials seems very plausible for someone with @entity3 's job history			1
and since he was a well known and successful executive , a background check was probably put on the back burner			0
why ? " @entity30 " is a possible culprit			1
the term groupthink was coined by @entity32 in 1972 to describe ill - fated decisions like in the cases of the @entity35 or the destruction of the @entity37			0
in these instances , small , cohesive committees engaged in flawed decision - making while being under the gun to produce a result quickly			0
group members feel the need to conform and be in a consensus , despite what their gut instincts tell them			0
while we do n't know all the factors that went into the vetting process of @entity3 , the executive search committee that was responsible for his review may have engaged in groupthink			1
fortunately , in @entity4 's case , the only bad outcome is that jobs were lost under @entity3 's leadership			1
@entity3 certainly is n't the only high profile executive to have been caught in this type of scandal			2
plenty have come before him and plenty will come after him			0
in @entity3 's case , it turned out that he did n't even submit a resume , and that he reached out directly to @entity4 about the job			1
how his record got embellished is not exactly clear at this point			0
whether he was in any way involved with enhancing his biography or somehow the resume mistakenly incorporated incorrect information , the firestorm over @entity3 serves as food for thought about the bigger issue of embellishing one 's resume			1
resume fraud is not uncommon			1
it is committed to gain a competitive edge in landing a job , but the rationale that people use to justify the fraud is less clear			2
some people actually perceive their lies to be 80 % truths and therefore see no problem in fudging their resume			0
other job seekers may feel the exaggerated information is permissible as a way to compensate for the many hard knocks they have endured in life			0
the more times that false information goes undetected , the more desensitized people become to their own deception , and will likely continue with this pattern of behavior			0
research has suggested that the best predictor of one 's future behavior is one 's past behavior			0
the more pieces of the puzzle that a job search committee can put together about a candidate 's past , the more accurate it will be in assessing that individual			1
nowadays , with a competitive job market and fewer jobs , recruiters should take extra precautions against resume fraud			1
in addition to background checks and verification of credentials , the interview process is an opportune time to ferret out any falsified information			2
structured job interviews with standardized questions are ideal for determining how qualified a candidate is for a job			2
but employers should be just as concerned about the candidate 's characteristics , especially their level of integrity			2
the unstructured employment interview -- informal questioning or conversation -- is better at revealing a candidate 's personality traits			2
candidates are usually caught off guard with small talk over dinner and drinks and inadvertently end up spilling the beans			0
any red flags in a candidate 's past will have a high probability of being raised if they exist			0
vetting a candidate thoroughly can sometimes be costly and time consuming , but it is worthwhile for the long - term health of the organization			1
i 'm sure this has been an expensive learning experience for @entity4			0
hopefully , others will take note			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160 .			0
