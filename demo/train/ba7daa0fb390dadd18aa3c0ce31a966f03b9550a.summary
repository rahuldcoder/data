-- a day after a @entity3 jet with 124 passengers landed at the wrong airport , many are asking : how in the world could that happen ? " it 's not common , but it 's not unheard of , " said pilot @entity7 , a 20 - year veteran of commercial aviation who has frequently flown @entity10 , the same kind of aircraft that touched down sunday at a small airport in @entity14 , @entity15 , about seven miles from where it was supposed to land at @entity17			1
the plane stopped about 500 feet from the end of a runway at @entity23 , but no one was injured , said @entity25 , the @entity27 @entity26 fire chief and emergency management director			1
" there are a lot of questions , and i suspect this is a matter of procedures not being followed , something along the long chain of everything you must do and constantly do as a pilot for safety , " @entity7 said			0
but that 's little consolation for passengers shaken by the experience			2
" really happy ( the ) pilot applied brakes the way he did , " said passenger @entity43			0
" who knows what would have happened ? " the airport 's runway is 3,738 feet long , about half the length of the @entity17 runway , which is 7,140 feet			1
that forced pilots to act fast and brake hard when the aircraft touched down			2
if they had not , the plane could have overshot the end of the runway , tumbled down an embankment and onto @entity62			1
air traffic controllers had cleared the jet to land at @entity17 and only learned of the mishap when the pilots radioed that they had landed at the wrong airport , a source familiar with the investigation told @entity0			1
@entity69 is not equipped with radar , and @entity71 has no control tower			1
@entity3 said the flight 's captain had worked for the airline for 14 years and the first officer had been with the company for 12			1
both were on paid leave pending an investigation , it said			1
the jet took off monday from @entity71 after " a thorough inspection " and was scheduled to resume regular service in the evening			2
the airline did not disclose its destination , but the aviation website @entity86 said it was bound for @entity88 , @entity89			0
" we have since reached out to each customer directly to apologize , refund their tickets and provide future travel credit as a gesture of goodwill for the inconvenience , " the airline said in a written statement			0
apology following landing announcement @entity101 told @entity0 the flight had been late in departing @entity104 's @entity103 on sunday afternoon , but nothing seemed amiss			2
as the plane touched down on the runway , however , @entity43 said he heard and felt the brakes hit hard and smelled rubber burning			1
it was " one of the hardest landings i ever experienced , " he told @entity0			0
@entity113 , who lives near the airport , said he was sitting in his living room when he heard the landing			2
" i thought it was a military plane because it 's so loud , " he said			1
" this airport takes small planes ... nothing to the level or volume of that plane			1
" " welcome to @entity17 , " the pilot announced , @entity43 recalled			0
a few minutes later , the pilot came back on			0
" i 'm sorry , ladies and gentlemen , we have landed at the wrong airport , " he said , according to @entity43			1
he then repeatedly apologized to passengers who were stuck on the tarmac for two hours while steps could be brought over from @entity17 to help them deplane			0
the pilots declined to talk about what happened as they left the plane , @entity25 said			1
while waiting , @entity43 and the other passengers ate peanuts provided by flight attendants			0
@entity3 offered them a $ 200 travel voucher , he said			1
paper and computer @entity3 spokesman @entity143 said sunday night he did n't yet have enough information to say why the plane landed at the wrong location			1
@entity0 first learned of the landing error via tweets from the region			2
there are many questions that the @entity152 and @entity153 will explore			0
both agencies have launched investigations			0
@entity7 gave insight into what investigators will be looking for in their probes			0
when the plane was still on the ground at @entity103 , the pilots would have looked at a paper flight plan on which the distance between their departing location and arriving location would have been written			1
that distance should have also been plugged into the cockpit computer			0
" you match one thing to the other , " he said			0
" let 's say there was 503 miles on the paper			1
the computer in the console should have matched that distance			0
" that 's important if the pilots end up doing what is called an instrument landing -- essentially where they rely on their instruments to assure everything is as it should be			1
if the equipment was correct on the ground at @entity103 , the instrument reading during an instrument landing would have indicated to the pilots they were descending to the wrong location			2
relying on instruments is sometimes the only alternative pilots have when the weather is poor or there are other factors making visual landing difficult			2
when the plane landed , it was 58 degrees fahrenheit in the area , with visibility for 10 miles and clear skies			1
it was a bit breezy with a south wind of about 20 mph			0
a checklist to mind regardless of particular variables , pilots should constantly be working on a checklist of safety measures			2
" you back the approach ( to a runway ) up ( consulting ) all the instrumentation and validation that you have available to you , " @entity7 said			2
that includes scanning the horizon , looking up and down , talking to air traffic controllers , reading instruments and communicating frequently with a copilot			2
some smaller airports do n't have towers			0
the airport where the @entity3 plane landed did not , but it 's unclear whether air traffic controllers were in touch with the pilots			1
when an airplane descends , the pilot will tell the controllers , " i have the runway in sight			2
" " once a pilot says that then the responsibility for getting that aircraft to that runway is n't a joint responsibility , " @entity7 said			2
" it 's the responsibility of the pilot			0
" pilot @entity240 has been flying into both @entity15 airports for a decade			0
he said a navigational tool called a localizer could have told the pilots that they were off			0
the airports have different runway numbers that would have popped up -- they are 20 degrees of difference between them			0
if pilots were only doing a visual landing , they might not have noticed the difference in numbers in a navigation tool			0
but even with all the instruments available to modern pilots , @entity259 , former inspector general of the @entity62 @entity260 told @entity0 that planes landing at the wrong airport are n't unusual			1
" a visual landing on side - by - side airports , not far apart ... that 's how it happens , " she said monday on @entity0			0
" it happens many times			0
" similar incidents sunday night 's incident brought to mind another landing at a wrong airport two months earlier			1
in november , a mammoth cargo plane landed at the wrong airport in @entity274 , @entity275 -- one that typically does not accommodate such beasts and with a runway half a mile shorter than such an aircraft usually uses			1
the @entity280 was bound for @entity281 from @entity283 's @entity282			0
but instead of landing at the military airport on @entity274 's southeast side , it landed at the much smaller , general aviation col. @entity288 on the northeast side			1
in august 2012 , a regional commuter plane landed at the wrong @entity294 airport			1
@entity295 , operated by @entity296 , was supposed to fly from @entity297 to @entity298 but landed instead at @entity299 about 10 miles away			1
@entity0 's @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 and @entity307 contributed to this report .			0

controllers learned plane had landed at the wrong airport when pilots radioed them , source says
@entity3 says it does n't yet know why the jet landed seven miles from its *intended* airport
the pilots have been removed from flying duty pending an investigation , @entity3 says
@entity14 airport 's runway is much shorter than @entity69 , where the jet was supposed to land
