@entity0 is struggling to push our longboat against the current of @entity6 's @entity5 , so we jump into the water to help him			1
" stay in the boat , " he pleads , but we ignore him			2
it 's dry season and every ounce of weight is a factor as the longboat 's hull scrapes the bottom of the shallow waterway			1
this is the only time we ignore @entity0			2
like other tattoo - covered @entity21 tribesman , he 's a master boatman and this is his territory			1
the @entity21 , once fearsome headhunters , are also expert trackers who have turned their talents to trailing one of the world 's most fascinating endangered creatures : orangutans			1
the ape pursuit takes us to @entity33 , a remote area of @entity34 that nudges the border of @entity36 , the @entity38 portion of @entity6			2
@entity6 and neighboring @entity40 island are the only places the shaggy - haired red ape survives			2
the chances of seeing them in the wild are increasingly slim			1
" there 's no guarantee , " warns @entity46 in its publicity blurb for the @entity48 , the safari that has brought us deep into the @entity53 island 's dense , steamy jungle			1
" ape numbers are about 20,000 and constantly declining due to forestry , palm oil crops and poaching			2
" far more certain is searing heat , humidity of 80 - 100 % , slippery conditions and the possibility of leeches			2
" this walk demands a great deal of physical and mental exertion , " says @entity65 , @entity46 's co-founder			1
" the region is totally isolated from the outside world			2
" pampering base fortunately there 's a soft option -- surprisingly , it involves a longhouse			1
longhouses are the large jungle huts that generations of @entity21 and other @entity79 tribes have called home			1
usually built on stilts , they 're dark , communal living spaces often shared by several families			2
the @entity84 in the @entity34 region of @entity87 's portion of @entity6 island takes its inspiration from traditional local homes , and translates this into luxury accommodation			1
seen from its jetty on the @entity5 , a massive man - made reservoir in the @entity33 region , the @entity94 - managed resort appears like any other longhouse in the area			1
built from large chunks of @entity102 ( ironwood ) , it sits amid swirls of mist on the edges of the reservoir			1
a huddle of pastel pink and blue painted longboats are tethered to its moorings			0
this will be our pre-and - post - punishment pampering base			0
here we can cool off in a swimming pool -- safely out of leech reach -- and escape the melting humidity in air conditioned suites			0
the next morning , we head upriver			0
deep in the tropical forests , we get a taste of life among the local @entity21 communities that have lived here , reputedly , since the 17th century			0
along the @entity125 and its tributaries , colorful longhouse settlements unfurl like streamers on the riverbanks			0
rice paddies cloak surrounding hillsides in velvet green crops			0
" as shifting cultivators , they always built their homes near navigable rivers , " says our guide , @entity134			0
" they were designed to last as long as their exploitation of rice farming in the area , before they moved on to new pastures			0
" tattooed bodies some traditional @entity21 dwellings are big enough to house 20 families he adds			1
they 're about 200 feet long			0
most are old ramshackle structures			0
while some @entity21 now live in new cement longhouses that have a generator - powered tv set or fridge , most stick to old customs			1
the @entity21 's name was once synonymous with headhunting -- tribes often saved the severed heads of their human victims as trophies			1
the tattoos swathing their bodies bragged of their triumphs			0
@entity167 was largely extinguished by the @entity169 colonial regime in @entity34 in the early 20th century			0
it made a brief comeback during @entity172 when the heads of 1,500 occupying @entity175 forces were paranged with glee			0
( @entity177 are machetes , swords and other blades used across the @entity181			0
) heads were mounted like trophies in @entity21 homes			0
the @entity21 have since lent their hunting skills to less grisly pursuits			0
in 2002 , @entity21 trackers helped map out the @entity48 for @entity46			1
the trek got the backing of the @entity169 's @entity191 for its noteworthy conservation efforts			1
today , a safari with the @entity21 offers one of the best chances of encountering the apes in their natural environment			0
@entity198 glimpses after traveling up the @entity200 to @entity46 's @entity202 lodge , we head out in search of orangutan			1
the @entity205 traces old @entity21 hunting tracks -- used for hunting heads as well as animals			0
on the four - hour walk to @entity210 , we stop midway for lunch by the river			0
our guides , @entity214 and @entity215 , dip nimbly into the surrounding forest where , in contrast to their bloodthirsty ancestors , they use their parangs for chopping foraged bamboo shoots and edible ferns			0
@entity215 stuffs bamboo logs with the jungle greens , chicken and rice and smokes them on a riverside fire			1
later , after an exhausting day of trekking through the jungle , we return to our base camp at the @entity94 longhouse			1
at the wood paneled @entity234 restaurant , we 're not so far from authentic @entity21 life			0
lapping up the lake nightlights , we eat local fish and sago puddings , more bamboo chicken and stir - fried jungle ferns			1
our encounters with the ape have been fleeting : glimpses of the world 's largest arboreal animal crashing through the trees in the distance			2
however , there were also opportunities for closeups at the nearby @entity251 , where apes that have been injured or illegally kept as pets are looked after before being returned to the wild			2
we can hardly be disappointed			0
we 've sensed the presence of this amazing creature in one of its only surviving habitats			2

once fearsome headhunters , the iban people are expert trackers who 've turned their talents to following orangutan
@entity94 's @entity84 is modeled after traditional longhouses , but is far more luxurious
the resort , on the shores of a jungle reservoir , is ideal for treks to find wild orangutan
