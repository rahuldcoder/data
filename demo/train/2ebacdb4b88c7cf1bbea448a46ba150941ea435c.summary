if you listen to rock or pop , you 've heard @entity5 's work			0
and if you were one of the 6.5 million people who listened to @entity7 's " @entity9 " on @entity10 during a three - month span in 2012 , you helped him , and his two co-writers , split a grand total of $ 110			1
" we could each buy a pizza , " said @entity5 , an inductee in the @entity13 who has worked with artists ranging from @entity16 and @entity17 to @entity18 and @entity19			0
" music streaming apps and sites were supposed to make music cheap -- or free -- for consumers while assuring that the artists who created the songs would be fairly compensated			1
but musicians and songwriters say they 're barely seeing any money from streaming			1
" it 's upside down , " @entity5 said			0
" it needs to get back in balance			0
it 's just simply not fair			2
" last week , singer @entity37 pulled all of her music from @entity40 , saying that the ability to stream her new album , " 1989 , " threatened to hurt sales			1
@entity40 has roughly 50 million users , who either pay $ 9.99 a month for the service or listen to a free version with advertisements			1
" i 'm glad the @entity37 thing has caused people to consider it more , because i do think it 's an imperfect business model , " said @entity48 , the @entity50 's @entity49 , whose albums are available on the streaming sites			1
the @entity57 of the world can actually make out well on streaming sites -- @entity40 said she had been on pace to make $ 6 million from the app this year			1
but @entity48 said he earns so little in online streaming royalties that he barely pays attention to them			2
" it does n't add to my income in any way that is n't negligible , " he said			1
in a blog post tuesday , @entity40 ceo @entity69 responded to @entity37 's decision and other artists ' complaints			1
" we started @entity40 because we love music and piracy was killing it , " @entity69 wrote			2
" so all the talk swirling around lately about how @entity40 is making money on the backs of artists upsets me big time			2
" @entity69 noted that @entity40 has paid more than $ 2 billion to record labels , music publishers and groups that distribute royalties to songwriters and recording artists -- $ 1 billion of which came in the past year			1
but @entity5 said that money gets divided up unfairly			0
too little of it trickles down to the people who wrote and recorded the music , he said			0
streaming sites treat each stream like a purchase , similar to downloading a song from @entity96			0
that kind of contract pays a bigger percentage to record labels than licensing agreements , which pay out at about 50 - 50 between artists and record companies			2
" at some point , they sold the acts some idea like , ' we 're promoting your music so you can go out and tour and make money with merchandise and ticket sales and stuff , ' " child said			0
" but a lot of those artists co-wrote with people like me			0
i do n't get a piece of the touring			0
i do n't get a piece of the merchandise			0
" in his blog post , @entity69 said he 's open to exploring ways to compensate writers and performers more fairly			1
earlier this year , @entity10 came under fire for its payment model after singer @entity132 had complained about it , saying she 'd gotten $ 114 for more than 4 million plays on the site			0
( @entity10 disputed that number			0
) on wednesday , @entity10 compared its service not to record sales , but to a traditional radio station			0
" as the highest paying form of radio , @entity10 is proud to play the music of thousands of artists for our more than 75 million users , " @entity139 , @entity10 's director of public affairs , said in an email			1
he noted that , as traditional revenue streams dry up , streaming sites like @entity10 are growing			2
" if half of radio listening shifts from terrestrial to @entity10 and other internet radio platforms , it will mean billions in additional royalty dollars for performers and songwriters , " @entity139 said			2
@entity10 's published rate for at least one form of royalties is .0013 cents per stream , divided among a song 's various interest holders			2
child said he 's working with other songwriters such as @entity167 -- who penned @entity169 's " @entity168 " -- on a system they call " fair trade music			1
" it would establish guidelines for fair treatment of artists			0
@entity48 said he believes that streaming sites should allow a set number of plays of any given song before the site asks users to purchase the music			1
" it would be nice to have peace of mind and be able to know i 'll be able to make music for the rest of my life without having to cut anybody 's grass but my own , " @entity48 said			1
" and i think that 's a worry for people who are at my level and the levels below me			0

songwriters and musicians say music streaming is n't paying the bills
@entity48 : @entity40 and @entity10 do n't " add to my income in any way "
@entity40 ceo says he 's open to looking for better ways to pay artists
songwriters are working on what they call " fair trade music " plan
