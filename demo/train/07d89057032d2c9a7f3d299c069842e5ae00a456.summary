-- so we thought @entity3 kids did great in school			2
a new study suggests that women and minorities are less likely to receive early support from potential academic mentors			2
researchers from @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 ran an interesting field experiment : pretending to be students , they e-mailed more than 6500 professors at top @entity18 universities admiring each professor 's work and asking to meet			1
the e-mails were all identical except for the senders ' names			0
names that one can associate with a gender or race -- like @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , and @entity33 -- were used			0
the researchers found that faculty were most likely to respond to e-mails from white males			0
but more surprising was the high level of racial bias against @entity40 and @entity41 -- professors were likeliest to ignore e-mails from these students			1
one of the researchers noted , " we see tremendous bias against @entity3 students and that 's not something we expected			2
... a lot of people think of @entity40 as a model minority group			1
we expect them to be treated quite well in academia			0
" the study highlights the pernicious nature of the " model minority " stereotype of @entity40 , and the fact that @entity40 are still viewed as the most foreign " other " in our @entity18 culture -- perhaps the biggest outsiders in the politics of " not like us			1
" a common refrain i hear from well - meaning friends and colleagues is : " what 's so bad about the @entity3 stereotype ? seems to me @entity40 have done all right			1
as a woman of color , i 'm keenly aware that on the spectrum of bias , there are plenty of worse things to be called than good at school			1
it does n't sound so terrible to be thought of as hardworking or quiet when there are so many more obviously sinister racial myths out there to bust			0
but the flip side of the model minority myth is an assumption that @entity40 do just fine and do n't need any mentoring or help in the academic or professional world			1
whether due to bias or mere lack of interest , the professors in the study treated @entity3 and @entity41 students differently despite their reputation for academic achievement			1
and this lack of mentorship while in school may lead to an achievement gap in the workplace			1
there 's still a huge disparity between the percentage of @entity40 graduating at the top of their class from the best schools in the country and the percentage of @entity40 who go on to achieve top leadership positions in their chosen fields			1
disturbingly , i have heard thoughtful colleagues wonder aloud whether the underrepresentation of @entity40 in senior leadership roles is due to systemic , external factors that should be addressed with reform in the workplace , or whether it 's @entity40 who are responsible for taking themselves out of the c - suite pipeline because " they 're just happy being the worker bees			1
" is there any truth to the perceptions that @entity40 are passive , lack leadership skills and assertiveness , are unwilling to take initiative or risk , and even unable to have fun or a decent sense of humor ? some people definitely think so			2
i 'm not the only @entity18 of @entity3 descent who has been told , in the form of a compliment , that i 'm surprisingly outgoing , funny , or sociable -- for an @entity3			0
i still get friendly compliments on my " very good @entity136			0
" and at one of my very first legal job interviews , one judge put it succinctly : " i 've always thought your people were very bright			0
" it 's the very benignity of these model minority stereotypes that render them so persistent and difficult to eradicate			1
so , what can we do about it ? we can start by improving mentor and sponsor programs			1
mentors and mentees are too often arbitrarily paired in the corporate world			0
employers should consider the real affinities that may actually exist within their workforce and offer employees the tools , training and access to identify , cultivate and maintain their own meaningful mentor and sponsor relationships			2
at one law job early in my career , i was assigned to a " mentor " who himself had only been at the firm a few weeks			0
why ? he was from @entity171			0
i 'm from @entity172 and grew up in @entity173 and i 'm not even @entity174			0
meanwhile , i went to a college that graduates about 400 students a year , and a white male senior partner whose office was down the hall had gone to this same small college , yet no one at the firm had stopped to think that perhaps i might have something in common with him			0
sure , it 's also incumbent on people to take initiative and simply walk down the hall and introduce themselves to potential mentors			0
but it would be incredibly helpful and transformative for the gatekeepers -- in academia , the corporate world , public service , media , entertainment and the arts , whatever path talented young people might choose -- to recognize the subtle , unconscious biases that sometimes prevent @entity40 from achieving their true potential			2
maybe then @entity40 in @entity18 can be recognized for bringing more to the table than just being good at school			1
@entity203 with author @entity204 about ' @entity205 '			2

a @entity11 study shows high level of racial bias against @entity40 and @entity41
@entity204 : the " model minority " stereotype of @entity40 is pernicious
she says even though @entity40 do well in school , in the workplace they fall behind
@entity204 : one way to help @entity40 is to improve mentor and sponsor programs
