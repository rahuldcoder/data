@entity0 , @entity1 -- something is stirring within the @entity5 body politic , a moderating trend that , if nourished and engaged , could transform @entity8 politics and the @entity11 - @entity10 peace process			1
there are unmistakable signs that the religiously based radical movement has subtly changed its uncompromising posture on @entity10			2
for example , in the last few months top @entity5 officials have publicly stressed that they want to be part of the solution of the @entity8 - @entity10 conflict , not part of the problem			1
what is happening inside @entity5 ' mosques and social base shows a concerted effort on the part of its leadership to re-educate its rank and file about co-existence with the jewish state and in so doing mentally prepare them for a permanent settlement in the future			2
in @entity39 mosques , @entity37 clerics have begun to cite the example of @entity41 , a famed @entity42 military commander and statesman , who , after liberating @entity44 from the @entity45 , allowed them to retain a coastal state of their own			0
the moral lesson of the story is that if the famed leader could tolerate the warring , bloodthirsty @entity45 , then today 's @entity8 should be willing to live peacefully with a jewish state in their midst			0
this story is important because it provides @entity5 with religious legitimacy and allows it to justify and explain its change of direction to followers			2
as an @entity62 - based movement , @entity5 ' very raison d'etre rests on religious legitimization , and its leaders understand that they neglect that at their peril			2
@entity5 ' recent narrative marks a pronounced departure from the past in which @entity5 moderates called for a minor or long - term truce			0
now @entity5 leaders appear to be going further by laying the ground for a shift in their position by educating their social base about the requirements of permanent peace -- recognition of the jewish state			2
although the evolution of @entity5 ' stance on the peace process has been slow , gradual and qualified , in the last three years many of its leaders repeatedly have said they wanted a two - state solution			1
pressed by an @entity91 journalist on policy changes that @entity5 might make to any new order , @entity85 , the top @entity5 leader and head of its political bureau based in @entity89 and considered a hard - liner , asserted that the organization has already shifted on several key points : " @entity5 already changed -- we accepted the national accords for a @entity8 state based on 1967 borders , and we took part in the 2006 @entity8 elections			0
" over the years , i have interviewed more than a dozen @entity5 leaders inside and outside the @entity8 territories			0
although , on the whole , @entity5 ' public rhetoric calls for the liberation of all historic @entity109 , not only the territories occupied in 1967 , a healthier debate occurs within			0
my recent conversations with @entity5 ' rank and file suggest that the militant organization has evolved considerably since the group unexpectedly won power in @entity39 in free elections in 2006			0
before then , @entity5 was known for its suicide bombers , not its bureaucrats			0
but that had to change			0
" it is much more difficult to run a government than to oppose and resist @entity10 occupation , " a senior @entity5 leader told me while on official business in @entity123 in 2007			1
" if we do not provide the goods to our people , they 'll disown us			0
" ironically , in spite of the @entity135 's refusal to regard this government as legitimate , the democratic demands for governance from within @entity39 are themselves driving change within @entity5			1
what is striking about @entity5 ' recent shift of opinion toward the peace process is that it has come at a trying time for the @entity142 organization which , in the last two years , has faced critical challenges from @entity145 - like jihadist groups , a low - intensity civil war with rival @entity147 , the ruling party of the @entity148 , and a deteriorating humanitarian situation in @entity39			1
last summer a militant group called @entity151 , or the @entity152 of @entity153 , one of a handful of radical @entity145 - inspired factions , declared the establishment of an @entity62 caliphate in @entity39 , a flagrant rejection of @entity5 ' authority			1
@entity5 security forces struck instantly and mercilessly at the @entity152 , killing more than 20 members , including the group 's leader , @entity163			0
in one stroke , the @entity5 leadership sent a message to its foes and friends that it will not tolerate the existence of global jihadist groups such as @entity145 : @entity5 will not allow @entity145 - inspired factions to turn @entity39 into a theater to wage transnational jihad			1
however , the challenge to @entity5 ' authority persists			0
@entity10 's punishing siege of @entity39 , in place since 2007 , along with the suffering and despair it has caused to its 1.4 million inhabitants , has driven hundreds of young @entity8 into the arms of small @entity183 extremist factions that accuse @entity5 of forfeiting the armed struggle and failing to implement quranic or @entity186 law			1
operationally and ideologically , there are huge differences between @entity5 and @entity145 and its various inspired factions , and a lot of bad blood			1
@entity5 is a broad - based religious / nationalist resistance whose focus and violence is limited to @entity109 / @entity10 , while @entity145 is a small , transnational terrorist group that has carried out attacks worldwide			1
thus @entity5 , unlike @entity145 and other fringe factions , is not merely an armed militia but a viable social movement with a large popular base that has been estimated at more than half a million supporters and sympathizers			1
@entity5 also has shown itself to be sensitive and responsive to @entity8 public opinion			0
a further example of its political and social priorities is @entity5 ' decision to engage seriously with an @entity123 - brokered deal that sketches out a path to peace with rival @entity147			1
despite its reactionary rhetoric , @entity5 is a rational actor , a conclusion reached by former @entity214 chief @entity213 , who also was @entity215 's national security adviser and who is certainly not an @entity10 peacenik			1
the @entity5 leadership has undergone a transformation " right under our very noses " by recognizing that " its ideological goal is not attainable and will not be in the foreseeable future , " @entity213 wrote in @entity224 a few months ago			0
his verdict is that @entity5 is now ready and willing to accept the establishment of a @entity8 state within the temporary borders of 1967			0
yet if @entity5 is so eager to accept a two - state solution , why does n't it simply announce that it recognizes @entity10 's existence and promise to negotiate a peace deal that allows the two countries to coexist ? in interviews with @entity5 officials , they stress that their organization has made significant concessions to the so - called quartet 's three conditions , though the quartet ( the @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 and @entity244 ) has not lifted the punishing sanctions against @entity5 nor has it effectively pressed @entity10			1
@entity5 ' diplomatic starting point will be to demand that @entity10 recognizes the nationalist rights of the @entity8 and withdraws from the occupied territories , but it will not be its final position			2
there could be no viable , lasting peace agreement between @entity10 and the @entity8 if @entity5 is not consulted about peacemaking and if the @entity8 remain divided with two warring authorities in the @entity254 and in @entity39			1
@entity5 has the means and public support to undermine any agreement that does not address the legitimate rights and claims of the @entity8 people			2
its rival , @entity147 and the @entity148 , lacks a popular mandate and the legitimacy needed to implement a resolution of the conflict			0
president @entity266 has been politically weakened by a series of blunders of his own making and by pressure by the @entity243 , compromising his moral authority in the eyes of a sizable @entity8 constituency			0
if , instead of ignoring @entity5 or , worse yet , seeking its overthrow , the @entity243 and @entity274 engaged the @entity277 based organization , diplomatically and politically , and encouraged it to continue moderating its views , the @entity135 could test the extent of @entity5 ' evolution and find out if the organization is willing to accept a settlement based on the two - state solution			1
so far , the strategy of isolating and militarily confronting @entity5 pursued by @entity10 and the @entity286 administration has not appeared to weaken the organization dramatically			2
if anything , what success this strategy has had in undermining @entity5 has been counterproductive , since it has radicalized hundreds of young @entity8 who have joined extremist @entity145 - inspired factions and reinforced the culture of martyrdom and nihilism			1
to break this impasse , and prevent further gains by more extremist factions , the @entity243 and @entity274 should support a unified @entity8 government that could negotiate peace with @entity10			2
the ongoing @entity123 - brokered truce deal between @entity5 and @entity147 is an opportunity that may be built on to repair and strengthen intra-palestinian governing institutions that have been frayed as a result of intense rivalry in the last two years			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity309 .			0
