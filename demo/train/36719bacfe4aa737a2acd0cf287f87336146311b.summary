-- ready to jive , cool cats ? let 's slide ! " @entity6 " ran as part of @entity5 's saturday morning cartoon lineup beginning in september 1971			1
a heavily fictionalized representation of the @entity6 's rise to fame and subsequent success , it was co-produced by @entity12 ( of @entity14 special fame ) and @entity15			1
a relic replete with bell bottoms , tie dyed shirts and reel - to - reel tape players , the series has been released on dvd / blu - ray by @entity23			2
every episode featured two musical numbers by the cartoon counterparts of @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31			1
the songs -- @entity6 staples like " @entity5 , " " @entity34 , " and " @entity35 " -- were woven in to the plotlines of the show , which experienced a renaissance in 1984 with @entity31 's rising solo career			1
although the show did n't feature the speaking voices of the @entity6 because of scheduling conflicts , it was them singing			2
" @entity6 " animation director @entity44 had co-directed the @entity46 ' " @entity47 " film and developed the reputation as an expert in music videos			1
@entity44 said his most important contribution to " @entity6 " was his insistence that the series not include violence			1
he was also adamant that the show -- one of the first cartoon representations of a black family --- be fair and not resort to cheap gags and stereotyping			2
" when i came in , " explained @entity44 , " the series had been started			1
i was not happy with the approach they were doing because ... ( this ) was going to be the first series directed at young people that was about a black group , and i felt that it was really important that it be shown in a creative way , that they solved their problems with music and with intelligence and not with violence -- which had started out as the approach in the first episode			2
" @entity44 , now 85 , attended art school at @entity80			2
after graduation , he traveled to @entity82 for what was supposed to be a six - month vacation			2
he wound up living and working there for 40 years , spending a decade in @entity86 , where he worked on " @entity47 " and " @entity6 , " among other projects			1
he then ran a studio out of @entity89 for 30 years			0
" there was a lot of influence from the stuff that we did in ' @entity47 ' in terms of interpreting songs in a creative , graphic way , " said @entity44			1
" it was a @entity99 production done in @entity86 , and i brought in as much of a @entity82 flavor as i could			1
" @entity44 commissioned studios throughout @entity82 to work on the two songs featured in each episode			1
" i got the best artists i could get and gave them complete freedom , " explained @entity44			2
" i said , for example , ' this is a circus theme , so the graphics have to reflect that theme			0
' other than that , they were completely free to do it however they wanted			0
we came up with some fun stuff , which was really one of the best parts and that was probably one of the things that made the ' @entity6 ' series so popular in terms of the reception that it received			1
" most episodes featured the @entity6 driving around in their charmingly dilapidated jalopy -- with pet mice @entity127 and @entity129 and pink snake @entity130 -- trying to please their manager , a cartoon version of @entity15 founder @entity134			1
@entity134 was never really the @entity6 's manager , per se , but in the cartoon universe it worked , with him coming up with ideas for publicity			1
in one episode , the @entity31 brothers take a plane -- with their jalopy tied to the aircraft -- to a concert similar to @entity144 and are pitted against evil lumberjacks planning to tear down the outdoor show 's forest venue			0
in another , @entity30 and @entity31 are accidentally drafted into the military and get their afros shaved off			0
in yet another episode , @entity31 is adopted by a female gorilla			0
another strange theme was that a disproportionate number of episodes featured young @entity31 falling unconscious : on a flight to @entity158 , the five brothers crash onto an desert island			2
@entity31 gets hit in the head with a coconut and encounters a band of pirates			0
in the episode titled " @entity166 , " the future @entity164 hits his head in a bicycling accident and dreams that he is a hiding in a cottage where his brothers have become dwarf - sized , like in the story of @entity174			0
@entity31 bites a poison apple and immediately collapses			0
in " @entity31 , " @entity31 becomes unconscious on a roller coaster ride and dreams he is in the wonderland theme park			0
in " @entity31 and the @entity179 , " @entity31 falls asleep and dreams that he has sold the jalopy in exchange for magic beans that grow a beanstalk outside his family 's home ( a la the story of @entity179 )			0
the hectic turnaround schedule was a concern for @entity44			2
" @entity192 was the vice president in charge of children 's programming at @entity5 at that time , and he was a friend of mine , and i got a message to him because i was really concerned , and i said ' what happens if i do n't deliver ? ' @entity44 said			1
" a few weeks later , one of his assistants came over -- we were working on some other things as well -- and we went out to lunch , and he said to me , ' by the way , i 've got a message for you from @entity192 : you do not not deliver			0
' " @entity44 , who is now retired and living in @entity208 , says there have been vast changes in the animation field since the days of hand - drawn cartoons			1
" it is losing something , because there 's something about hand - drawn animation , " he said			0
" i do n't know whether this is because i 'm nostalgic for it or what , but as somebody said , ' the difference between hand - drawn animation and computer animation is , computer animation does n't have a soul			0
' " of course , he does n't think all is lost			0
" there 's one thing that has n't changed , and that is communication , story , idea			0
when you 're making a film , the basics still come down to : did you have a good script ? is it well - presented ? once it 's prepared , the technique of animation does n't really make a difference anymore			0

animation director @entity44 co-directed the @entity46 ' " @entity47 "
