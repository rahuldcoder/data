-- the wait for @entity3 fans is finally over ! the @entity5 musical comedy returns tuesday night with a brand - new episode titled @entity7 , where @entity9 auditions and snags the role of @entity12 's understudy in @entity13 , causing a feud resulting in @entity12 moving out			1
back in @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 battle to be the class valedictorian			2
last month , @entity5 confirmed the show would be moving permanently to @entity20 for the remainder of the current season and for season 6 , which will be the series ' last			1
@entity0 talked to the cast on the @entity3 set while celebrating their special two - part 100th episode airing march 18 and march 25 , when several past members of the @entity29 come back to @entity30 for a week to celebrate what the now - disbanded ( ! ) glee club did for them			1
read on to find out exactly when we will be saying goodbye to @entity15 , plus some teases about upcoming performances			2
can you say foam party ? bye - bye , @entity15 ! so when will the show say goodbye to @entity40 for good ? the 100th episode is divided into two parts , and @entity43 told @entity0 that by the end of that second episode , it 'll be the @entity46 from then on			2
some are calling episode 101 the @entity15 season finale , as it will also feature the graduation of the current seniors before some of them make the move east			2
new to @entity20 @entity12 , @entity9 , and @entity54 will be joined in the city that never sleeps by @entity17 ( going to film school ) , @entity57 ( to model ) , and @entity59 ( to get married ? )			1
@entity43 also told us that @entity62 's @entity61 will be popping up in a couple of episodes too			2
but what about @entity66 and @entity67 ? @entity66 said she has n't been written into any of the @entity20 scripts yet but is not officially done with the show by any means			1
@entity5 confirms ' @entity3 ' moving setting exclusively to @entity20 " i guess we have to get back into our characters " @entity74 wanted to make it clear that just because the show 's setting is moving to @entity20 , that does n't necessarily mean the entire cast is			1
joking that many people have asked if the show 's move meant he had to move permanently too , @entity74 said , " i do n't know if you understand how tv works			1
we do n't actually shoot in @entity15 , @entity40			2
" of course a lot of the show will be filmed in @entity20 , but the majority of production is likely to remain in @entity89 , for now			1
but the vibe of the group seems different			2
@entity43 noted that at one point while filming , the cast was talking to each other and so in the moment catching up , that they did n't realize that they had actually begun to tape the scene and had called action			0
@entity43 is n't sure if any of what they were actually talking about got into the episode but was quick to note at the time , " i guess we have to get back into our characters			0
" no more school stories the show is going to take on more adult - oriented stories in @entity20 , dealing with real post-high school life issues			1
" we are gon na take some time just in @entity20			1
see where that takes us , " executive producer @entity110 said			0
" we 're really excited about adult stories out of high school when nobody gives a hoot about you			0
how does that feel to suddenly be nobody from being the biggest hero ? " @entity120 forever after ? " when you move in with somebody in any relationship , it 's going to be a challenge			0
i think they are going to face some challenges together and see if they can get through them or not , " @entity74 teased about the post-proposal life of @entity59 and @entity54 in @entity20 together			1
" there are some cool , very adult themes that are exciting to explore			0
fans that have gotten older while watching the show can relate			2
" @entity0 's ' @entity3 ' coverage the foam party you wish you were invited to though details are still wrapped up , @entity110 teased that guest stars @entity141 and @entity142 , both reprising their roles from earlier seasons of the show , appear in some amazing musical numbers together , including one centered around mr. @entity148 ( @entity149 ) and lots of foam			1
luckily , everyone got to join in on the fun too			0
" let 's just say , we party			0
it 's a party like all the time on @entity3			1
you might want to quote me exactly how i said that , " @entity74 playfully said			0
@entity74 joined the show after both blond bombshells had already made their guest appearances , so he did n't get to work with them			2
but now ? " i was closer than i ever thought i would get to @entity142 in my lifetime , so i 'll take it ! " plus , here is the list of fan - favorite songs that will be in the 100th episode : 1			1
