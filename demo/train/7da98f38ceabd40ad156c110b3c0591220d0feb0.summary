" the move to @entity2 is close			0
i 've always said i want to go back there and @entity2 have said they 've wanted me from the time i left there			0
" they are still saying the same now			0
it is 95 percent done and dusted , so i do n't see why it is not going to happen now			2
" @entity1 has been told by @entity12 coach @entity38 that he must be playing in a competitive @entity40 league is he is going to have a chance of playing at his fourth @entity14 finals			1

i 'll carry on working hard , playing as hard as i can , and just to give myself a chance			0
" if i 'm in the squad , then great , and if not , then we 've got a strong squad of players that can go to @entity56 and make it interesting			0

@entity12 had already qualified for @entity56 before the final two qualifiers , and @entity1 was an unused substitute in saturday 's 1 - 0 defeat in the @entity64			1
he was brought on against @entity15 with @entity12 1 - 0 ahead and immediately brought cohesion to an experimental lineup as his first touch -- an unexpected short corner -- gave @entity70 room to fire in the second goal			1
@entity1 also hit the post late in the match as he was denied his first goal at @entity12 's national stadium , after striker @entity76 had wrapped up the win with his second of the match and 18th in 35 matches			2
@entity1 's move to @entity2 in january was unpopular with the @entity6 's fans and his teammates , but he seems to have won them over in recent weeks after helping the club reach the @entity8 playoffs for the first time since 2005			1
on sunday , @entity88 travel to @entity89 to take on the @entity90 , who are tied with the @entity6 on 44 points at the top of the @entity94 along with @entity95 , with two matches of the regular season still to play .			0
