-- the @entity1 issued arrest warrants monday for @entity4 leader @entity3 and two of his relatives			1
@entity1 judge @entity7 read aloud the decision to issue warrants for @entity3 , his son @entity10 , and his brother - in - law @entity11			1
@entity10 is a close adviser to his father			0
his arrest warrant came two days after his 39th birthday			0
@entity15 serves as @entity3 's head of intelligence			1
the warrants are " for crimes against humanity , " including murder and persecution , " allegedly committed across @entity4 " from february 15 through " at least " february 28 , " through the state apparatus and security forces , " the court said in a news release			2
in @entity28 , where fighting has raged , a crowd cheered monday following the news from the court			0
the announcement at the @entity32 came as fighting inside @entity4 inched closer to the capital			2
a rebel fighter , @entity35 , told @entity0 that rebel forces were 80 kilometers ( 50 miles ) from @entity37 on monday			0
@entity4 is not a signatory to the @entity39 that established the international court 's authority , and the court does not have the power to enter @entity4 and arrest the leaders			1
many of those cheering in @entity28 saw the news as a sign that the world recognizes the conduct that rebels say @entity3 's regime has been engaged in			1
the three - judge @entity54 at the @entity32 found " reasonable grounds to believe that the three suspects committed the alleged crimes and that their arrests appear necessary in order to ensure their appearances before the court , " the announcement said			2
the court also believes the warrants are needed to ensure that the three men " do not continue to obstruct and endanger the court 's investigations ; and to prevent them from using their powers to continue the commission of crimes within the jurisdiction of the court			2
" the @entity71 referred the matter to the @entity1 through a resolution february 26 , following widespread complaints about @entity3 's efforts to crush a rebellion			2
the resolution said that , while " states not party to the @entity39 have no obligations under the statute , the @entity71 urged all states and concerned regional and other international organisations to cooperate fully with the court and the prosecutor			0
" @entity3 's backers rejected the court 's authority			1
" this court is nothing but a cover to the military operations of @entity92 , " said @entity4 justice minister @entity88			1
" it is merely a political tool for exerting pressure and political blackmail against sovereign countries			0
" @entity4 deputy foreign minister @entity99 offered a similar view : " both the international criminal court and the chief prosecutor have neither the legal competence nor the moral compass in any way to pass judgment on anyone , let alone the @entity4 people , " he said			2
@entity110 spokesman @entity109 said the warrant for @entity3 is another indication that the @entity4 leader " has lost his validity			1
" " it 's another step in the process of holding him accountable , " @entity109 told reporters			0
the @entity120 issued a statement monday about the arrest warrants , noting that " hundreds of people are confirmed to have been killed since opposition forces rose up against the regime of mr. @entity3 in february as part of a wider pro-democracy movement across @entity128 and the @entity129			0
" the @entity130 said it " fully supports " the court and underscores that the court 's @entity4 investigation " is an independent judicial process which must be fully respected			1
" not everyone was cheering the news			0
@entity137 , an analyst with the conservative @entity138 , said the court 's move could damage efforts to get @entity3 to end his 42 - year reign , because he would not seek refuge in a country that is a party or signatory to the @entity39			1
" the @entity1 's arrest warrant symbolizes the dirty underside of international law , " @entity137 said			0
" while the @entity1 makes itself feel good and diplomats can chatter about their commitment to international law , the fact of the matter is their action takes off the table any possibility that @entity3 could flee to a retirement haven outside @entity4			1
in effect , the @entity1 arrest warrant tells @entity3 to fight to the death			2
" most @entity163 countries are parties or signatories to the @entity167 statute			0
the @entity1 website lists a total of 47 non-signatories in the world , 13 of them in @entity128 and the @entity129			0
@entity173 , an analyst at the @entity174 who was born in @entity4 , said the @entity1 decision " complicates " the matter			1
" since last week , things were heating up toward an exit strategy for @entity3 and his sons , either inside or outside @entity4 in another @entity163 country , " @entity173 said			1
some rebel leaders in the @entity182 said they would consider allowing @entity3 to stay inside @entity4 , and both sides were starting to indicate a compromise was possible , @entity173 said			1
but now , the regime " may circle the wagons a little more , " and @entity3 will think , " ' i 'm a hunted criminal and should pursue civil war to the end , ' " @entity173 said			2
while the @entity1 decision is justified , @entity173 said , cynics in the region will ask why @entity3 was selected and not others			0
" why not ( former @entity194 president @entity193 ) @entity193 ? why not ( former @entity196 president @entity195 ) @entity173 ? " @entity193 and @entity173 both gave up power following protests in their countries			0
" the court is selecting some dictators to indict , and being silent about others			0
that may be the biggest issue for the court , " @entity173 said			0
when asked about those suggestions , @entity206 spokeswoman @entity205 said the @entity210 " believes that the decision to refer the case to the @entity1 was the right decision ; that the @entity1 has spoken now about the need for justice and accountability			1
with regard to whether this hurts or helps , it does n't change the fact that @entity3 's got to take the message that it 's time to go			1
" the issue of @entity4 casualties led the @entity71 to adopt a resolution in march authorizing force by whatever means necessary , with the exception of a ground invasion , to protect civilians			0
@entity92 began bombing military targets a short time later			1
the @entity1 action comes a day after the @entity226 announced @entity3 will not be part of its next attempt to map out a peace deal in @entity4			1
it was unclear who would represent the @entity4 government in negotiations , or when negotiations might occur			0
journalists were not allowed to ask questions following sunday 's meeting of the @entity226 's special committee on @entity4 in @entity239 , @entity240			2
@entity0 's @entity241 , @entity242 and @entity243 contributed to this report .			0

@entity251 : " this court is nothing but a cover to the military operations of @entity92 , " says @entity4 official
@entity110 spokesman calls it another sign @entity3 " has lost his validity "
@entity206 spokeswoman says @entity3 must realize " it 's time to go "
@entity4 - born @entity210 analyst says @entity3 will now think he should fight until the end
