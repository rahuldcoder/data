@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has been the face of @entity6 's news broadcast for 24 years			1
the program 's estimated audience of more than 2 million viewers exceeds most @entity11 news broadcasts			2
@entity3 is also a best - selling author of 10 books			1
his latest is " a country for all : an @entity14			2
" @entity2 spoke to him in @entity0 where he was covering @entity1 's controversial immigration law , @entity18 : @entity2 : you came to the @entity20 as an immigrant yourself			1
what is your story ? @entity3 : well i was working as a journalist in @entity26 , and one day when i was very young out of college they censored one of the stories that i was doing on the president of the country			1
and back then i was very idealistic -- and i still am -- and i decided to quit			2
i quit my job in @entity26			1
i sold my car for $ 2,000 , got a student visa and came to the @entity20			1
and it was supposed to be for only one year , that was january 2 , 1983 , and that year has become 27 years			2
so this country gave me the opportunities that my country of origin , @entity26 , could n't give me			1
@entity2 : how were you able to stay in this country on a student visa ? @entity3 : the student visa became a work permit			1
with the work permit i started working as a reporter in @entity49 and then after being a few years in @entity49 i became at 28 the anchorman for @entity6 news			1
@entity2 : you have written 10 books in your time here , often focusing on @entity55			2
but why immigration ? why now ? @entity3 : it 's a book on the urgent need to have immigration reform			1
as we can see what happened in @entity1 [ the overturning of parts of @entity18 ] it 's a step in the right direction for @entity55 and immigrants , but it 's simply not enough			2
things are exactly the same as two weeks ago or two months ago or two years ago or even 20 years ago because we still have 11 million people in the @entity20 without any rights whatsoever			1
it 's really incredible that the most powerful country in the world is treating 11 million people as second - class citizens or second - class human beings			2
@entity2 : you 're getting a lot of criticism with this book not for criticizing the conservatives who are targeting immigrants , rather for accusing president @entity83 of breaking a campaign promise			1
@entity3 : @entity87 , when @entity83 was running for president he told @entity6 in an interview that he was going to have an immigration bill during his first year in office			1
it was an important promise because back then @entity83 was trying to the get the @entity93 nomination against @entity94			1
@entity94 had promised that she was going to do it during the first 100 days			0
anyway , @entity55 believed @entity83 ; 67 percent of @entity55 voted for @entity83 and at the end president @entity83 did n't keep his promise			1
so , @entity83 broke his promise , @entity93 do n't have the political will to push for immigration reform right now and @entity102 are missing in action during immigration			1
nobody is really doing anything for immigrants right now			0
@entity2 : as an anchor for one of the largest @entity112 - speaking news networks in the world , have you been able to get the @entity93 leadership or the president to tell you what is behind the delay ? @entity3 : i think it 's politics , simply politics			1
@entity93 are very scared of losing the elections in november			0
the democrats are afraid of losing control of the @entity124 , if not the @entity125			0
so they are not willing to push their luck right now on immigration and since immigrants , especially undocumented immigrants , ca n't vote there is really nothing to gain			2
but it was a campaign promise			0
democrats were , most of them , for immigration reform and right now when they see the political wings are going the other way they are doing nothing			2
because of the lack of action and leadership in @entity145 , that 's why things like this are happening in @entity1			0
other states realize that nothing is happening in @entity145 and they 're taking immigration into their own hands			2
it 's wrong , but that 's what they 're doing			0
@entity2 : let 's talk about the @entity102 at the national level			0
there 's a movement within @entity160 , many of whom are @entity163 , who are trying to promote a " not @entity1 but not @entity166 " position			0
is the @entity102 listening to them ? @entity3 : i do n't think honestly that the @entity102 is listening to them			1
the @entity102 has to make peace with @entity55 , otherwise they 're going to keep on losing election after election after election			0
@entity55 will become the majority in this country in less than 100 years			0
we wo n't be here to see it , but without the @entity181 vote , no one can make it to the @entity183			0
if @entity102 do n't make peace with @entity55 , @entity184 is going to become a blue state and republicans are going to keep on losing elections			0
they do n't get the fact that immigration is the most important symbolic issue for @entity55			2
other issues are more important jobs , education , health care , but immigration is the most important issue			2
if @entity102 do n't get it , they are going to keep on losing the @entity181 vote			0
@entity2 : millions of @entity112 - speaking people living in @entity20 watch @entity6			1
during the @entity18 story when you were in @entity0 at the @entity202 , you were surrounded by hundreds of people watching your live shots			0
what do your viewers want in the way of immigration reform ? @entity3 : it 's very simple			1
they want to be legal in this country			0
they know that they are not criminals			0
they know that they are not terrorists , yet they 're being blamed for the crime in this country			0
those who are criticizing them , they 're completely wrong			0
crime is down in all the @entity20			1
most immigrants are not terrorists or criminals			0
they do n't abuse the system and they are very frustrated because no one is paying attention to them			0
so what they see in @entity6 -- the @entity112 language media -- is the kind of leadership that they do n't see in politicians			1
i mean look , @entity55 are 15 percent of the population and we only have one @entity20 senator , so there is a lack of leadership in the @entity181 community			1
the only way for them to communicate is through @entity112 language media			1
that 's why you see hundreds of people whenever we go , you know ? @entity2 : as a journalist you know that we must remain objective			0
seeing all these admirers , i can not help but wonder how you can remain objective on this story			0
@entity3 : i think it is a fair question and i think its something that i that i have to answer very honestly			1
as a journalist , i am not allowed and i will never give my opinion on the air when i 'm doing the newscast			0
i have to give both points of view and that 's exactly what i do all the time			0
but as an immigrant with a voice , because i have the privilege of having a voice , there are times when i have the need to talk for those who do n't have a voice			0
as long as you 're very clear on your roles , as long as you tell people exactly what you 're doing , i think i am being fair and honest			0
@entity2 : will your next book be based on this immigration coverage ? @entity3 : i do n't know , i do n't know			1
but right now i know that immigration reform has to be won in @entity287			2
i mean the book in @entity112 has sold very well , but it really does n't matter because i 'm speaking to the converted			1
immigration reform has to be won in @entity287 and that 's the only way			2
even with an accent , you know ?			0
