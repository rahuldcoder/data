@entity0 -- the @entity5 hopes air traffic controllers may soon benefit from long - standing research into worker fatigue by implementing strategies that include intentional sleeping on the job , the use of caffeine and other methods shown by science to deal with the overnight shift			1
" a controlled nap can boost performance significantly , " said @entity5 board member @entity14 at a briefing with reporters monday at agency headquarters			1
citing a 1995 study from @entity21 that has been backed by other research , he said , " a 26 - minute nap improved performance 34 % and alertness 54 %			0
" the study prompted an advisory that has been adopted by some international air carriers to keep pilots more alert in the cockpit			2
the measures were not moved forward by the @entity32			0
congressional lawmakers may soon consider legislation reauthorizing the @entity32 that includes provisions addressing the problem of fatigue			2
the @entity5 's recommendations monday followed a listening tour of air traffic controllers around the country			1
the board 's advice is issued to federal and other agencies			0
inside an air traffic controller 's life referring to a variety of transportation workers who unintentionally fall asleep on the job , the @entity5 official said , " we have many circumstances of documented , uncontrolled spontaneous sleep episodes , " including incidents among air traffic control , long - haul trucking and railroads			1
according to the research , " a short nap can boost performance , a long nap can make you groggy , " @entity14 explained , saying the tactic of catching a few winks is but one element in a comprehensive plan			0
although @entity67 transportation secretary @entity66 directed the @entity32 to increase overnight staffing in air traffic control towers in response to unplanned sleeping on the job , @entity14 says that alone wo n't solve the problem of fatigued controllers			1
what 's going on with air traffic controllers ? " if you do n't have a fatigue management plan , and you just throw more people at it , then you 've got more tired people on , " he said			1
" however many people you throw at the problem , you 're still gon na have the fatigue risk			2
" the @entity87 also hopes the @entity32 will implement scientifically validated improvements to fight fatigue in the control tower			0
in a written statement , @entity92 president @entity91 said , " there is nothing groundbreaking about these recommendations			0
they are common - sense solutions to a problem @entity87 and fatigue experts have consistently raised for years while past administrations turned a blind eye			2
" @entity14 says the @entity5 identified the problem of fatigue among air traffic controllers 30 years ago , but only within the past 15 years or so has the research revealed what fights the problem			1
he used the example of sleepy drivers who turn up the radio and roll down a window to try to stay awake on the road			1
" they only work for 10 minutes or so , " he said , saying the research suggests greater benefits from pulling over for a short nap			0
" @entity117 , caffeine , light physical activity , light levels , engagement -- social engagement -- can work , " @entity14 said			0
and addressing the economic issues of improved staffing and the cost of scheduling people more in line with their sleep clocks , @entity14 said , " most people focus on the cost of the fatigue risk when an accident happens			2
" what people do n't quantify is what they 're losing in productivity and performance before that , " he added .			0

" controlled napping " may help those on the overnight shift stay awake
@entity5 for 30 years has cited problem of fatigue among air traffic controllers
adding staff may add more sleepy people without wide reform , board says
