@entity0 -- for the first time since september 11 , 2001 , @entity2 is having a vigorous national debate about how to succeed in @entity5			1
this debate is entirely worth having			0
whenever @entity2 sends its citizens into harm 's way , it must do so with eyes wide open			1
though no veteran would ever think of himself as " pro-war , " i believe that the fight in @entity5 is critical to our national security			2
our goals there are achievable and success is worth the continued sacrifice			0
we must succeed in @entity5 for many reasons , but one stands above all : the world walked away from @entity5 once , and it descended into a cauldron of violence , hatred and human rights atrocities that served as the base for the worst terrorist attack in history against our homeland			1
we can not let that happen again , and we can not let the @entity35 and its @entity37 allies conquer @entity5 once more			1
failure of this kind would also destabilize the entire strategically vital region , including nuclear - armed @entity42			0
we know what it takes to succeed in @entity5 : a resolute commitment to the principles of counterinsurgency , which turned @entity48 around during the surge			1
i am confident that properly resourced counterinsurgency policy , adapted to the unique culture and geography of @entity5 , can lead to success there			1
our entire military chain of command supports this approach , as do our @entity59 allies , which they made clear at their recent defense ministerial meeting in @entity61			0
i supported president @entity62 when he called for a counterinsurgency plan in march , and i did so again when he deployed gen. @entity64 to lead the command in @entity66			1
i agree with our commander 's assessment of the security situation as " deteriorating " and that our civilian and military leaders urgently need more resources , including more combat troops , to turn the tide toward success			2
i sympathize with our president , because sending men and women into harm 's way is the most difficult decision that a commander - in - chief must make			0
however , @entity2 are already serving in harm 's way in @entity5 , and the sooner we can provide the reinforcements and resources they need , the safer and more successful they will be			1
so i am urging president @entity62 to move as quickly as possible to fully support gen. @entity64 's request for more troops			1
it is true that the @entity5 government is not as strong or credible as we would like , but that should not deter us from committing more civilian and military resources now			2
local governments in counterinsurgency environments are usually weak and fledgling			0
there is an insurgency in the first place because it seeks to exploit the local population 's dissatisfaction with its government			0
as long as @entity5 is insecure , it is unreasonable to assume that governance will improve			2
that is why protecting the population must be job one right now , and in the immediate term , much of that work must be done by @entity2 and @entity59 troops			1
as security improves , however , we will be able to train capable , battle - tested @entity5 security forces that can defend their country			2
we can break the insurgency 's momentum , enabling @entity5 to reconcile with former fighters who are willing to lay down their arms			2
and we can create an environment of safety in which it is more realistic to expect @entity5 leaders to meet the high standards of their fellow citizens and their international partners -- namely , the provision of justice and opportunity , the protection of human rights and a crackdown on corruption			0
ultimately , @entity5 will judge the legitimacy of their government not only by the result of one round of voting , but by its performance in delivering basic services			0
success in @entity5 will emerge , as it did in @entity48 , when local leaders and citizens are more and more able to take responsibility for governing and securing their own sovereign country without substantial international assistance			0
this wo n't be perfect or easy , but it will allow @entity2 's fighting men and women to leave @entity5 with honor , and it will enable @entity5 to build a better , more peaceful future			1
that is our goal , and we must stay in the fight until it is won			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity158 .			0
