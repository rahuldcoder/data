it is @entity1 , and let us celebrate single - mother households -- not as half empty , but as half full of strong women			1
it is a good time to encourage children raised by women to see themselves as resilient , not doomed			0
and it is time , today and every day , for our culture to stop assigning blame and start offering help			1
the 19.7 million children in this country with delinquent or absent fathers are not all headed for lives of crime , drugs , poverty and prison			0
to begin : single moms have given us olympian @entity22 , comedian @entity23 , presidents @entity24 and @entity25			1
i can name many more , from my own life , and i 'll bet you can from yours			0

the proud son of a single mom			1
popular culture routinely offers up hackneyed depictions of struggling single moms and screwed - up kids			1
and there is no end of studies , many aimed at getting delinquent dads to step up , that show kids of single moms facing an uphill battle when it comes to such things as performance in school , college attendance and earning potential			1
i am the single mother of three sons -- grown to manhood and doing just fine			1
and i am here to tell you that the reality for kids from single - mom households can be as good as it is for kids in two - parent homes -- better , in some cases			1
particularly with input from different arenas , single mothers can envision the futures of their children in a very positive light			1
in the recent book , " @entity73 : what @entity77 to know , " authors @entity75 and @entity79 assert that positive role models and an environment of support are key to a child 's success			1
and several recent studies point to a range of factors -- from a mother 's religiosity , external emotional support and a grandparent living in the home -- that can concretely contribute to single mothers ' raising productive , happy children			1
a study of 1,134 single mothers , published in the april issue of @entity99 , found that those who attend religious services are more likely to experience positive developmental outcomes for their children			1
in a separate report in february , published in @entity104 , data show that regardless of economic status , ethnicity or education , the single mothers who were regularly offered emotional support had " children and adolescents who were also more likely to display social competence and school engagement , " compared with single mothers without social support			1
a 2002 study published in @entity116 showed that teenagers living with their single mothers in multigenerational homes " have outcomes that are at least as good and often better than the outcomes of teenagers in married families			2
" i have been divorced since 1996 , when my sons were 7 , 5 and 2			0
i have found that my faith practices , help from my siblings , and reliable and persistent help from my mother kept my sons on the straight and narrow			0
of course there are single mothers who fail their children			2
of course there are good fathers who make sure their children have a chance to succeed			0
and children with two loving parents in the home can still encounter big troubles			0
beyond that , there are realities that are hard to dispute			0
a new study , " @entity143 : an economic view of @entity148 , " describes the apocalypse caused by single parenting framed in economic terms			2
this white paper , by @entity151 - based economic modeling specialists , describes the education gap , earnings gap and ultimately value lost from direct and indirect labor income to the nation 's economy of $ 60 billion per year			2
according to the study , children growing up in one - parent homes are 16 % more likely to drop out of high school			0
only 14.3 % of students from one - parent households will attend some college , compared with 17.6 % in two - parent households			0
but that is the bad news			0
i say let 's focus on the other sides of those figures , the kids who succeed and the single moms who get them there			1
to be sure , single mothers are swimming against the tide in a culture that in its predominant narrative declares our children are liabilities in society , not blessings			1
for years , screens large and small have been flickering with images of single mothers as seriously flawed and in need of rescue			2
in " @entity189 , " @entity188 's character , @entity187 , needs @entity190 to financially and emotionally rescue her to help her raise her son			2
in " @entity194 , " the single mother character is trying to date herself out of her parenthood predicament			2
@entity198 's recent " @entity197 " follows three single mothers who have to band together in order to survive			1
but beginning next week , " @entity204 " will for the first time feature a single mother as the sun in the solar system of suitors			2
that 's a kind of progress , i suppose			0
let 's see more of that			0
and let 's see more success stories			0
here are a few : my oldest son graduated from the @entity213 in 2011 and is now in @entity214 earning a master 's in translation in @entity217			0
my middle son is completing his junior year at the @entity219 and will graduate next may			0
my youngest son is headed to the @entity221 in august			0
