@entity13 19 details the posts and institutions that were created by the power - sharing deal , including the position of prime minister intended for @entity11 , leader of the @entity20			1
the publication of the draft is the first step in creating a law in @entity1			2
for the law to pass , it must be appear before parliament in 30 days , according to the country 's constitution			2
if it is approved , it will be sent to @entity3 for his signature			1
the deal arose after @entity11 withdrew from a june 27 runoff days before the vote , saying @entity3 's supporters had waged a campaign of violence and intimidation against opposition supporters			1
the two leaders signed the initial agreement , brokered by former @entity43 president @entity42 , in july but have failed to agree on how to form a cabinet			1
the @entity20 , the main opposition party , noted that @entity3 's latest move does not legalize the amendment			1
" gazetting the bill -- which was done by [ @entity3 's party ] @entity49 -- does not automatically translate into passing it into law , " @entity20 spokesman @entity47 said			1
" that can only take place if outstanding issues have been addressed			2
otherwise we will not support the bill			0
" the two parties agreed last month to the draft amendment during talks in @entity43 , but @entity47 warned then that problems remained			2

i need to hasten to mention that we still have some outstanding issues , such as the cabinet , appointment of diplomats , " he said in late november			0
@entity49 lost its majority in the parliament in the march elections			0
as no party has the two - thirds majority to pass the law , its passage relies on @entity20 support			1
if parliament does not approve the amendment , @entity3 may call for new elections , @entity1 justice minister @entity76 told state - run daily newspaper @entity80			1
" i envisage that it will require two weeks for it to be debated and passed through both houses			0
if no support is forthcoming , it means that @entity84 will be dead matter , " @entity76 is quoted as saying @entity80			0
" in the event that the collaboration that we envisage is not forthcoming , then that will necessitate fresh harmonized elections at some point in time , " he said , according to @entity80			0
@entity11 won the most votes in the march election , but not enough to avoid a runoff , according to the government 's official count			1
@entity43 president @entity97 , chairman of the @entity98 , welcomed the draft			2
" the gazetting of @entity102 of the @entity1 @entity103 is indeed a major step towards the formation of an inclusive government in @entity1 , " he said in a written statement			0
" we urge the @entity1 political parties to establish an inclusive government			0
" meanwhile , the country is battling a cholera outbreak that has killed nearly 800 people since august , according to the @entity113			0
more than 16,000 people have been infected , @entity113 said			0
this week , @entity3 declared that " there is no cholera in the country			1
" his spokesman later said @entity3 was sarcastically ridiculing what he believes are @entity121 designs to invade the country			1
another @entity1 official , information minister @entity123 , said friday that the disease was a " calculated , racist attack on @entity1 by the unrepentant former colonial power , which has enlisted support from its @entity129 and @entity121 allies so that they can invade the country			2
" @entity131 ruled the country as a colony until 1965			0
@entity123 's claims triggered quick and pointed reaction from @entity131 and the @entity129			0
