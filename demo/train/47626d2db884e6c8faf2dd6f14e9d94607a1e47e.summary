@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 announced thursday a " contingency plan " to confront the problems affecting @entity1 's economy , which has been rocked by the international financial crisis			1
farmers in @entity1 went on strike in october to demand the government lower export taxes			1
@entity12 said her goal was to increase domestic consumption -- in the face of a drop in demand for exports -- in order to sustain @entity1 's economic growth and avoid a rise in unemployment			1
" the restrictions come from outside the country , not from inside , and we are backing this contingency plan precisely because of those restrictions , because of those policies that are devastating the world as we know it , " she said			0
she said the government would set aside about $ 4 billion as an incentive to be used for consumption -- loans to buy household appliances and credits to maintain activity in the auto industry -- though she did not say where those funds would come from			1
in addition , the central bank will offer financing at 11 percent to companies that promise not to lay off employees , the government announced			2
one economist welcomed the moves			0
" the measures tend , on the one hand , to reactivate the levels of consumption that have been beaten back , especially in the last month , particularly in durable goods , the auto industry and household appliances , " economist @entity48 said			2
" @entity56 is a program that tends , in its line of financing , to inject liquidity into the business sector , especially the industrial and farm sectors that are paying interest rates above 35 percent			0
" the government also announced a 5 percent decrease in withholding tax for the export of wheat and corn -- taxes that had stirred fierce debate in the country -- - and the launch of two plans , @entity75 and @entity76 , which will result in another 1 percentage point drop in the withholding tax when production increases			1
representatives of the business sector applauded the announcements , saying they underscore the importance of restoring credit in the country and making efforts to keep people employed			0
but the reaction of the rural sector was mixed , with the @entity90 calling the measures good but insufficient and the @entity92 saying they wo n't solve farmers ' problems			0
@entity95 , an economics professor at the @entity96 at @entity97 , predicted the economic crisis would cause much of @entity99 to grapple with difficulties in the coming months			1
" the effect is going to be big , " he said			0
" 2009 is going to be very difficult for @entity99 , in part , because obviously there is a very important fall in the price of @entity99 commodity exports and , in part , because the drop in industrial activity will affect the manufacturing sectors of @entity111 and @entity112 , which are connected to the economic activity in the @entity114			1
" more importantly , he said , was the freezing of the international financial system and a general lack of access to financing			0
" this translates into difficulties in maintaining lines of credit for export and difficulties for countries with external debt to find refinancing			2
" he called on the @entity114 government , " which has access to financing that nobody else has , " to use it to redirect resources so that @entity99 countries can find financing			2
@entity95 , who is @entity137 , said the situation in his home country was particularly fragile , " because the president has been spending thinking that the price of petroleum would be somewhere else			0
