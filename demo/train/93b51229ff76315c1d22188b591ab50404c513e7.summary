" " the challenges we face as a nation are now more numerous and difficult than when i first arrived in @entity0 , but i have no doubt that we can meet them			0
for throughout my years in @entity1 , i have heard hope as often as i have heard heartache			2
where i have seen struggle , i have seen great strength			0
and in a state as broad and diverse in background and belief as any in our nation , i have found a spirit of unity and purpose that can steer us through the most troubled waters , " he wrote			0
@entity3 then quoted @entity117 -- " another son of @entity1 " who left for @entity119			1
" to this place , and the kindness of these people , i owe everything , " he quoted @entity117 as writing about @entity1			2
" today , i feel the same , and like @entity117 , i ask for your support , your prayers , and for us to ' confidently hope that all will yet be well , ' " @entity3 wrote			2
his letter concluded : " with your help , along with the service and sacrifice of @entity27 across the nation who are hungry for change and ready to bring it about , i have faith that all will in fact be well			0
and it is with that faith , and the high hopes i have for the enduring power of the @entity27 idea , that i offer the people of my beloved home a very affectionate thanks			0
