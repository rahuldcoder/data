-- the @entity1 and the @entity2 are being criticized for not keeping better track of @entity4 in the months before the @entity6 bombings			1
how could they have ignored such a dangerous person ? how do we reform the intelligence community to ensure this kind of failure does n't happen again ? it 's an old song by now , one we heard after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 and after the @entity15 's failed attack in 2009			1
the problem is that connecting the dots is a bad metaphor , and focusing on it makes us more likely to implement useless reforms			1
connecting the dots in a coloring book is easy and fun			1
they 're right there on the page , and they 're all numbered			0
all you have to do is move your pencil from one dot to the next , and when you 're done , you 've drawn a sailboat			0
it 's so simple that 5 - year - olds can do it			2
but in real life , the dots can only be numbered after the fact			1
with the benefit of hindsight , it 's easy to draw lines from a @entity45 request for information to a foreign visit to some other piece of information that might have been collected			1
opinion : agencies often miss warning signs of attacks in hindsight , we know who the bad guys are			1
before the fact , there are an enormous number of potential bad guys			1
how many ? we do n't know			2
but we know that the no - fly list had 21,000 people on it last year			0
the @entity65 , also known as the watch list , has 700,000 names on it			0
we have no idea how many potential " dots " the @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity70 and other agencies collect , but it 's easily in the millions			1
it 's easy to work backwards through the data and see all the obvious warning signs			1
but before a terrorist attack , when there are millions of dots -- some important but the vast majority unimportant -- uncovering plots is a lot harder			1
rather than thinking of intelligence as a simple connect - the - dots picture , think of it as a million unnumbered pictures superimposed on top of each other			2
or a random - dot stereogram			0
is it a sailboat , a puppy , two guys with pressure - cooker bombs or just an unintelligible mess of dots ? you try to figure it out			1
it 's not a matter of not enough data , either			2
piling more data onto the mix makes it harder , not easier			0
the best way to think of it is a needle - in - a - haystack problem ; the last thing you want to do is increase the amount of hay you have to search through			0
the television show " @entity108 " is fiction , not fact			0
there 's a name for this sort of logical fallacy : hindsight bias			1
first explained by psychologists @entity117 and @entity119 , it 's surprisingly common			2
since what actually happened is so obvious once it happens , we overestimate how obvious it was before it happened			0
we actually misremember what we once thought , believing that we knew all along that what happened would happen			0
it 's a surprisingly strong tendency , one that has been observed in countless laboratory experiments and real - world examples of behavior			2
and it 's what all the @entity132 dot - connectors are doing			0
before we start blaming agencies for failing to stop the @entity136 bombers , and before we push " intelligence reforms " that will shred civil liberties without making us any safer , we need to stop seeing the past as a bunch of obvious dots that need connecting			2
@entity117 , a @entity143 prize winner , wisely noted : " actions that seemed prudent in foresight can look irresponsibly negligent in hindsight			0
" @entity117 calls it " the illusion of understanding , " explaining that the past is only so understandable because we have cast it as simple inevitable stories and leave out the rest			0
@entity154 , an expert on risk engineering , calls this tendency the " narrative fallacy			0
" we humans are natural storytellers , and the world of stories is much more tidy , predictable and coherent than the real world			0
millions of people behave strangely enough to warrant the @entity1 's notice , and almost all of them are harmless			1
it is simply not possible to find every plot beforehand , especially when the perpetrators act alone and on impulse			0
we have to accept that there always will be a risk of terrorism , and that when the occasional plot succeeds , it 's not necessarily because our law enforcement systems have failed			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			2

@entity1 , @entity2 criticized for not keeping better track of @entity4 before attack
@entity177 : connecting the dots seems easy in hindsight , but in real life , it 's not
he says there are an enormous number of potential bad guys
@entity177 : if a terrorist plot succeeds , it does n't mean law enforcement systems failed
