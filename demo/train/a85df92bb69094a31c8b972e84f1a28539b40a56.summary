as sen. @entity0 soldiered through her re-election race this year with sinking poll numbers and the heavy drag of president @entity4 , the refrain from her strategists and supporters was always the same : do n't count her out			1
she will pull it off in the end			0
but in the hours before a runoff election on saturday , when the three - term @entity14 @entity13 faces @entity16 congressman @entity15 , it is hard to find anyone predicting the kind of eleventh hour victory that @entity0 pulled off in 1996 and 2002 -- turning her into a political legend			1
" sen. @entity0 has been a fabulous closer , " said @entity22 , a political science professor at the @entity23			1
" two of her three races , she was not supposed to win			0
" @entity0 is facing voters more than a month after the midterm elections that virtually wiped out @entity28 in the @entity29			1
she failed to clear a 50 % threshold in november needed to avoid a runoff so @entity0 is heading into what could be the final race of her career battling nearly every trend that toppled @entity28 this election cycle			1
her base has shrunk dramatically in a state where @entity16 are ascendant and she is one of the last white democrats in the @entity29 holding statewide office			2
@entity14 voters remain apprehensive about the uneven economic recovery , and suspicious of the president 's health care law			2
adding to her struggle , @entity0 is a symbol of incumbency at a time when frustration with the deadlock in @entity51 is at an all time high			2
her best argument -- clout -- evaporated nov. 4th when the @entity16 took firm control of the @entity56 , diminishing the import of her race			1
her embarrassing loss on the @entity61 pipeline vote that she recently forced in the @entity56 only underscored @entity0 's diminished power in @entity51			1
in the runoff phase , @entity0 has consistently trailed @entity15 , a physician			1
while there are many reasons to distrust midterm polling , the early vote numbers for saturday 's runoff also seemed to spell doom for the @entity28 senator			1
" the percentage of whites is up			0
the percentage of men is up			0
the percentage of @entity16 is up			2
the percentage of @entity28 is down			0
none of these things are good for sen. @entity0 , " said @entity22 , listing the trends in early ballots cast			1
" if she 's holding a magic card , then everyone in the world wants to know why she has n't played it yet			0
" like all the other vulnerable @entity28 facing re-election in red states this year , @entity0 faced long odds with a midterm electorate that is historically more white , wealthy and conservative than in presidential years			2
when she was forced into the runoff by @entity14 's " jungle primary " -- she did n't even come close to the 50 % threshold needed for an outright win -- she faced the more daunting prospect of turning out distracted voters on a saturday in december , at a time when she and her allies are being heavily outspent by @entity16 allied groups			1
" there 's no perfect playbook for this kind of election , " said @entity100 , who managed the successful off - year election of @entity102 as governor of @entity104 last year			2
at this juncture , " it 's a turnout game , and it 's pretty straightforward			0
" @entity0 's formula for victory saturday is to pump up turnout among @entity115 voters across the state while drawing support , as she has in elections past , from independents and moderate @entity16 in the counties that ring @entity121			1
that two - pronged strategy is n't so easy this year in a state that @entity4 lost by 17 points			2
she ran ads rebuking the president on @entity127 and energy issues , while trying to avoid alienating black voters			0
she selectively ran some of those ads outside the @entity121 media market			0
she tapped her father , @entity133 , for a series of father - daughter ads reminding black voters of the family legacy			2
as the mayor of @entity121 in the 1970s , @entity133 won the respect of many black voters by desegregating the workforce and opening high - ranking city jobs and contracts to blacks			2
but the collapse of the coalition that always carried @entity0 across the finish line was stunning on nov. 4			2
turnout was strong among black voters , who comprise about 30 % of the electorate			0
but @entity0 's support among white voters slid to 18 % from 33 % in 2008			1
she lost ground among self - described independents and moderates , and even among women — one of her chief targets in her recent events			0
the erosion of her support was particularly striking given the weaknesses of her opponent			0
" @entity15 is a really stiff , wooden , uncommunicative candidate who is a bad speaker , " said @entity164 , a political science professor at the @entity165			0
" he 's your geeky family doctor			0
" @entity28 strategists privately mused that they wished @entity15 's wife -- a far more charismatic figure -- had run instead			0
but @entity15 relentlessly pounded the @entity170 narrative and the line that @entity0 had voted with the president 97 % percent of the time			2
so far , it has worked			0
" this election has not been about @entity15 , " @entity164 said			0
" this election has been about the negative press that the president has gotten and the ability of @entity15 to tie @entity4 and ( @entity179 ) @entity180 to @entity0			1
in this final act saturday , the @entity14 race will test the limits of the vaunted @entity0 turnout operation , particularly in @entity121 , which has been the family stronghold for generations			1
after @entity187 , @entity0 operatives were vigilant about maintaining their voter data — scrubbing their voter files to make sure addresses and phone numbers were up to date after each purge of voters who had moved out of state by the secretary of state 's office			1
@entity0 's campaign also partnered with the @entity28 to register scores of new voters across the state this year , focusing particularly on ushering new black voters into the party			1
in saturday 's election , it is hard to underestimate the importance of @entity0 's turnout operation in @entity121 , which encompasses the @entity121			1
" they 've always considered @entity121 to be their firewall , " said @entity207 , director of the @entity208 at the @entity209			0
" they need that get out the vote machine operating in the city to help overcome the deficit she will face throughout the rest of the state			0
" she won her first race in 1996 by less than 6,000 votes -- but with a huge margin in @entity121			0
in 2002 , like this year , the @entity28 pulled its ads and much of its financial support -- writing off the runoff race as a lost cause -- but she eked out a win in part by boosting black voters ' share of the electorate above the level of the first round of voting -- an unusual feat for a runoff			1
in @entity0 's best race in 2008 -- a year when she rode on @entity4 's coattails -- she won by more than 121,000 votes			1
but if you took out @entity121 , her margin was only about 21,500 votes			0
underscoring the importance of @entity121 , @entity0 brought in @entity243 -- the campaign manager for her brother , @entity244 -- to head the campaign in a recent shakeup			2
earlier this year , he helped @entity247 win a majority of the black and the white vote in @entity121 to become the first white mayor of the predominantly black city since his father left the office in 1978			0
but the number of voters turning out to cast ballots in @entity121 dropped in the latest round of early voting			0
@entity0 's campaign insists that the numbers were skewed by the @entity263 holiday , and they are counting on high turnout on @entity265			1
to many others , however , it just seemed like the latest sign of foreboding for a race that is unlikely to go well for @entity0 on saturday .			1

sen. @entity0 is in a tight runoff race on saturday
@entity115 - @entity115 voters will be key to her success
@entity0 's @entity16 opponent ties her to @entity4
