-- with july fourth upon us , many are pausing to ask why @entity3 is special -- and how we see that reflected in our politics			1
the @entity7 screenwriter @entity6 kicked off the debate early with his first episode of @entity11 's " @entity10			0
" in a scene that has generated a lot of buzz , a young woman rises from a college audience to ask the protagonist ( played by @entity18 ) what makes @entity3 the greatest nation on @entity21			2
he shrugs her off : " the @entity23			0
" pressed by the moderator to give a real answer , he dodges again			0
eventually the protagonist breaks -- and delivers a jeremiad , declaring that @entity3 is no longer the greatest country in the world , that it is losing its soul , but that it used to be great and , yes , can still right itself			2
some critics tore into @entity6 , arguing that the show crossed the line into petulance and preachiness ( one of us , @entity37 , is in this camp )			0
others found the scene inspiring and wondered why today 's presidential candidates do n't speak to the country like that ( @entity44 is in this camp )			0
so , the question lingers this july fourth : what makes @entity3 special ? strikingly , @entity50 and @entity51 have different takes on @entity3 exceptionalism -- and indeed , on what values are most important			1
each is on record calling @entity3 the greatest nation on @entity21 , but they seem to believe so for different reasons , in different ways			2
news : we 're no. 1 ! we 're no. 1 ! we 're ... uh ... not ? @entity51 takes an old - fashioned , @entity64 view : like the young woman in " @entity10 , " he makes no secret that he thinks @entity3 is the greatest nation in history			1
for him , @entity3 are a chosen people who continue to live out the view of the @entity70 @entity69 that we should be as a city upon a hill , an experiment in democracy and liberty that inspires the world			1
almost every recent president has evoked that image , no one more so than @entity80			0
president @entity50 , back in 2009 , found himself in hot water for giving voice to a different version of @entity3 exceptionalism : " i believe in @entity3 exceptionalism , just as i suspect that the @entity86 believe in @entity88 exceptionalism and the @entity89 believe in @entity89 exceptionalism			1
" ( @entity50 went on to say : " i am enormously proud of my country and its role and history in the world ... [ a ] nd i think that we have a core set of values that are enshrined in our @entity99 , in our body of law , in our democratic practices , in our belief in free speech and equality that , though imperfect , are exceptional			1
" ) belief : the power of @entity3 exceptionalism @entity51 ( along with other @entity109 hopefuls ) has seized on comments like that to make pride in @entity3 a centerpiece of his campaign ( slogan : " @entity116 " )			1
firing up @entity118 voters in advance of the state 's @entity109 primary in march , he told them : " our president does n't have the same feelings about @entity3 exceptionalism that we do			1
" many of @entity51 's stump and victory speeches have attacked @entity50 as an apologist and offered paeans to the nation ( including , in @entity131 , memorably bursting into song with " @entity133			1
" ) @entity50 's account , by contrast , is grounded in the approach taken toward @entity3 exceptionalism on many campuses today			1
@entity139 , a world - class sociologist and no liberal ( he was closely associated with the @entity141 ) , advanced the argument most cogently some years ago			0
@entity3 , he insisted , is not exceptional because it is better than everyone else ; it is exceptional because it is different , an outlier embracing a unique set of values			1
as the @entity88 philosopher @entity150 once wrote : " @entity3 is the only nation in the world that is founded on a creed			2
" what comprises that creed is open to some debate , but @entity139 hypothesized that @entity3 espouse five core values , stemming from key historical experiences , that distinguish us from other @entity161 nations : liberty , egalitarianism , individualism , populism and laissez - faire			1
@entity139 illustrated his point by recalling how the governments of @entity170 and the @entity3 at virtually the same time announced that their nations would convert to the metric system			2
the @entity170 , who tend to respect authority , soon complied			0
but the @entity3 ? individualist to their core , always less respecting of authority , thumbed their noses			2
as @entity181 might have said , we won this country inch by inch -- we were n't about to give it away kilometer by kilometer			0
photos : faces of citizenship whatever they think about exceptionalism , academics and politicians today tend to accept these five as core @entity3 values			1
yet as @entity139 and others have argued , these values can be in serious tension with each other			0
those who believe foremost in egalitarianism , for example , run in very different directions from stout defenders of laissez - faire			0
in politics , nowhere does this tension between core values play out more starkly than in debates over liberty versus equality			2
@entity109 have traditionally argued that a free society allows everyone to do better , while @entity212 have objected that without basic fairness , society as a whole is held back			0
in that spirit , @entity51 ardently defends liberty and just as ardently , @entity50 defends social equity			1
on taxes , for example , @entity51 believes that affluent @entity3 have been taxed enough -- to do more would limit their freedom ; @entity50 believes that they should pay more so that the playing field is more level			1
similarly , @entity109 attack @entity224 as an infringement upon liberty , while @entity212 see it as necessary to extend a basic protection to all @entity3			2
on this @entity229 , then , we have an @entity3 where many , including our leading politicians , disagree on what makes the country special -- and on what values should take precedence			1
there is nothing inherently wrong with such disagreements : indeed , a competition of ideas is healthy for the republic			0
but , as has become painfully obvious , the differences in perspective have become so sharp and deep that we are tearing ourselves apart			0
that 's why this @entity229 should not only be an occasion for wondering what makes @entity3 special , but also for pondering how we can build bridges across the divide			1
in the divide over liberty versus equality , there does seem one basic value that both sides hold in common : a belief in equality of opportunity -- that everyone in @entity3 should have a chance to succeed on his or her merits			2
@entity51 talks of " rebuilding the foundation of an opportunity society , " and it was @entity50 who first rocketed to national fame in 2004 by proclaiming that in no other country on @entity21 would his story have been possible : " we hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal			1
" that belief in the importance of equality of opportunity is widely held across the country , even as our politics appear ever more divided			0
for our money , the winner of the 2012 election wo n't be the one who makes a stronger argument for egalitarianism over liberty or liberty over egalitarianism , but the candidate who joins the two , persuading voters he is best equipped to lift floors as well as ceilings , ensuring every @entity3 has an honest shot in life			1
as for the debate over exceptionalism , the candidates ought to study that scene from " @entity10			0
" while they will want to steer clear of petulance and sanctimony , surely there is much good to come from being straight with people ( if perhaps a bit more optimistic )			0
we have been special in history and we have also been different , but we have , in many respects , lost our way , and it is long past time to reclaim our souls			0
" @entity3 , " @entity308 once wrote , " is a poem in our eyes			2
" we are still writing its words			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers .			0

@entity314 , @entity315 : how is @entity3 's specialness reflected in politics ?
they say @entity51 's take on @entity3 's exceptionalism : @entity3 are a chosen people
@entity50 's take : @entity3 is special because it 's different , an outlier with unique set of values
writers : the candidate who will win in 2012 will show he can join liberty , egalitarianism
