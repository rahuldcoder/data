@entity0 was born without a trachea but now has one made from plastic fibers and a stew of her own stem cells			1
the 2 - year - old @entity7 @entity6 has spent every day of her life in intensive care , kept alive by a tube that substituted for the windpipe that was supposed to connect her mouth to her lungs			1
but nearly a month after her transplant , the toddler is mostly breathing on her own and is responding to doctors and nurses			1
the surgery , pioneered by dr. @entity20 , director of the @entity21 at the @entity22 in @entity23 , was only the sixth performed in the world , and @entity0 was the youngest patient and first to receive the transplant in the @entity27			1
the procedure was approved by the @entity29 as an experimental operation for patients with very little hope of survival ; being born without a trachea is fatal in 99 % of cases			2
@entity36 : stem cell therapies may cure chronic conditions @entity20 performed the nine - hour operation on april 9 at the @entity40 of @entity41 after carefully creating the windpipe using stem cells from @entity0 's bone marrow that were saturated over a matrix of plastic fibers shaped into a tube			1
exactly what happens to the windpipe after it is transplanted is n't clear , but researchers believe that placing stem cells , which are capable of developing into different types of body cells , can pick up signals from their environment and integrate with existing tissues			1
@entity20 told the @entity57 that the body 's regenerative capabilities may help such bioengineered organs to integrate with existing tissues			0
children may make the ideal patients for these procedures since they have natural and active abilities to heal and grow			0
" @entity0 's transplant has completely changed my thinking about regenerative medicine , " he told the @entity57 , adding that he wants to conduct a clinical trial in the @entity27			1
for children born with a windpipe defect or without one , and for others with defective or diseased organs , manipulating stem cells to generate healthy tissues or organs could be their only chance at survival			2
@entity36 : cancer patient receives a man - made windpipe @entity20 performed all five of the previous transplants of the bioengineered windpipes ; four of the patients have done well , while one , @entity87 , who received his trachea in @entity23 , died			2
last year , in describing @entity87 ' operation , @entity90 's @entity89 wrote : " @entity20 has been perfecting the process of using stem cells to seed bioengineered scaffolds for organs like the trachea since 2008 ; in his first such procedure , he used a donor trachea to replace that of a @entity100 woman , stripping the organ of its cells and coating it with the woman 's own stem cells			0
but using a completely synthetic , bioengineered matrix such as the one transplanted in @entity107 , he says , makes the transplant safer for the patient , potentially sparing him the complications that can arise if he ca n't accept the new organ			2
" researchers have used similar stem - cell - seeding techniques to create other organs			0
dr. @entity115 at @entity116 generated bladders and a urethra using scaffolds and patients ' stem cells			0
" because of the small number of patients he has treated , his critics say it 's hard to determine how valid @entity20 's bioengineering technique is in treating patients like @entity0			1
but he plans to conduct a clinical trial to properly assess the risks and benefits of the procedure , and document how bodies react to the transplanted devices			0
hopefully those trials will show that it 's possible to regenerate not just organs but hope as well			0

@entity0 spent the first two years of her life in the intensive care unit
a month after her windpipe transplant , the toddler is mostly breathing on her own
@entity146 was the youngest and first to receive this transplant in the @entity27
