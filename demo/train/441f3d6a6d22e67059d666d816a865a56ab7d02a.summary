@entity0 -- did n't we tell you that the lines between smartphones and tablets are blurred ? case in point : the @entity9 , a 7 - inch tablet that 's also a phone			1
beware : the @entity9 is a completely different device than the @entity13			0
there 's no smartphone - becomes - tablet witchery here ; the @entity9 is a 7 - inch tablet , powered by @entity18 4.1 and sporting a 3g chip			1
you can use it to make calls , although we do n't think a 7 - inch device is ideal for the task			2
the @entity9 looks pretty much exactly like @entity26 's @entity25 , which is hardly surprising since @entity9 makes that device as well			1
however , the @entity9 is very different from most other @entity18 tablets in a one important way : it 's powered by the new @entity30 ( for comparison , the @entity25 is powered by @entity33 's @entity32 )			2
more from @entity34 : future of mobile is virtual reality , says @entity18 @entity30 vice president @entity38 claims the processor " delivers the power , performance and flexibility required to accommodate a range of devices and market needs			0
" however , the actual @entity32 model in the @entity9 is a single - core atom clocked to @entity48 , which does n't inspire confidence			0
with our short time with the @entity9 , we 've tested @entity38 's claim , and we can say that the @entity9 feels snappy , on par with other tablets of its size of the @entity56 and @entity18 variety			0
other specs include a 1280x800 7 - inch @entity60 screen , 8/16gb of storage ( expandable via @entity63 memory cards ) , and a 3 - megapixel camera that can record 720p video			0
all of that is crammed into a case that weighs 340g and is 10.4mm thick			0
the device will be available from march 2013 , with prices starting at â ‚ ¬ 219 ( $ 286 ) for the @entity71 version			1
how do you like the @entity9 ? would you buy an @entity30 - powered @entity18 tablet ? share your thoughts in the comments			1

presenting : the @entity9 , a 7 - inch tablet that 's also a phone

the device is *released* march 2013 , with prices starting at $ 286
