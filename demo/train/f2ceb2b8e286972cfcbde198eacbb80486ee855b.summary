-- a quip often attributed to @entity2 defines insanity as conducting the same actions repeatedly but expecting different results each time			0
by that characterization , insanity has been running rampant in @entity8 , where diplomats from @entity10 and the @entity11 , the five permanent members of the @entity13 and @entity14 , have extended the deadline for talks aimed at resolving concerns over @entity10 's nuclear program			1
the problem is not the attempt to resolve the crisis through diplomacy , but rather that the current diplomacy neither takes into account past @entity10 behavior nor the lessons from similar diplomacy two decades ago to resolve @entity29 's clandestine nuclear work			1
first , it 's important to remember the root of distrust regarding @entity10 's nuclear program			1
@entity10 has , for several decades , declared nuclear enrichment and experimentation to be its unalienable right			1
it signed the @entity37 , membership of which includes technology sharing and enrichment			0
every signatory , however , must negotiate a @entity43 with the @entity44 , the @entity46 's nuclear watchdog , an agreement the @entity44 concluded in 2005 that @entity10 violated			2
efforts to resolve suspicion about @entity10 's nuclear ambitions are based on two pillars : logic and behavior			1
@entity10 authorities repeatedly say they want an indigenous nuclear program to power their country and they seek energy security			2
the problem is that @entity10 only appears to have enough uranium reserves to provide fuel for eight reactors -- the number @entity10 authorities seek -- for 15 years			2
conversely , for a fraction of the cost of its nuclear program , @entity10 authorities could refurbish and expand its oil and gas refinery and pipeline network and power itself for more than a century			2
then , of course , there 's @entity10 's past behavior			1
accusations against @entity10 rest not on secret intelligence such as that used in the lead - up to the @entity77 , but rather on a litany of lies exposed by successive @entity44 inspection reports			2
countries seeking only a civilian program do not construct enrichment sites in secret , acknowledging them only after their discovery			0
nor do countries pursuing civilian energy experiment with nuclear bomb triggers			0
@entity10 president @entity90 's past contributes to the questions over his motives			1
in april 2009 , for example , @entity90 reportedly bragged that when he earlier headed nuclear negotiations , he used the talks to distract the @entity96 while @entity10 upgraded its centrifuge capacity			1
and for all the discussion of supreme leader @entity101 's supposed fatwa against developing nuclear weapons , no such fatwa exists on his webpage			0
nor does it appear that @entity10 officials quote it consistently , suggesting they may have simply made it up to confuse			2
a key problem with the current diplomacy is that it fails to consider what it would take to force a real @entity10 compromise			1
@entity10 authorities up to and including @entity101 have sworn no compromise on @entity10 's right to enrich			2
rather than challenge that demand , the @entity115 administration has acquiesced to it , in the process voiding multiple unanimous or near unanimous @entity13 resolutions prohibiting @entity10 enrichment			2
while @entity10 officials insist an enrichment freeze is a nonstarter , it is important to recognize that @entity10 authorities have in the past reversed themselves on issues about which they have been equally rigid			1
for example , revolutionary leader @entity127 compromised on @entity130 hostages not because of the persistence of diplomacy , but rather because @entity134 's invasion of @entity10 made @entity136 's isolation too great to bear			1
in contrast , the @entity115 tactic of presaging negotiations by agreeing to unfreeze $ 7 billion in frozen assets and by allowing @entity10 to court new investment fails to increase @entity10 's isolation to its breaking point			2
negotiation absent leverage always fails			0
and even if an agreement is reached , there is no indication that it takes into account the vital lessons of @entity29 : it has been just over 20 years since the @entity130 and @entity29 signed the @entity152 , a hard - fought agreement meant to return @entity29 to the good graces of the @entity155			1
at the time , diplomats understood that the agreement was flawed , but they calculated a bad agreement trumped no agreement			0
in a subsequent book about their experience negotiating with the @entity165 , @entity160 and his colleagues explained , " if @entity29 could walk away from the treaty 's obligations with impunity at the very moment its nuclear program appeared poised for weapons production , it would have dealt a devastating blow from which the treaty might never recover			0
" then , as now , preserving the treaty trumped all else , even if it meant creating the fiction of effectiveness			0
and , just as the @entity115 administration appears frustrated with @entity184 prime minister @entity183 for raising public objections to the deal , 20 years ago , the @entity181 team did likewise after @entity179 president @entity178 raised doubts about the wisdom of the accord and the direction of negotiations in a @entity193 interview			0
of course , in hindsight , @entity179 was right			0
@entity29 viewed the agreement as a means to a cash infusion , not as an obligation to forfeit nuclear ambitions			0
but , as evidence surfaced that @entity29 was cheating , diplomats sought to exculpate @entity202 so as to preserve the appearance that diplomacy had worked			1
indeed , the desire to keep diplomacy alive became so deep that when the @entity130 @entity208 concluded in 1999 that it could not certify that @entity29 was using food aid as stipulated in its agreements , the @entity207 objected on the grounds that to acknowledge cheating would undercut diplomacy			1
ditto when the @entity208 reported that @entity29 had diverted heavy fuel oil			0
history shows that once a process begins , the @entity207 will not allow it to end			0
keeping the talks alive soon trumps all other considerations , including their initial purpose : preventing nuclear proliferation			0
alas , fiction can trump reality for only so long : @entity29 nuclear tests belie the progress it made against the backdrop of diplomacy			1
so , back to @entity10 : assessing the @entity229 's previous nuclear negotiations , @entity10 negotiator @entity230 once reportedly bragged that @entity10 negotiators had " managed to make far greater progress than @entity29			1
" regardless of what happens now an extension has been announced , one thing is certain : as disputes arise , diplomats will shift the goalposts to keep all sides at the table			0
and once again , diplomatic insanity will triumph as @entity136 grinds closer to its end goal .			0

@entity244 : current @entity10 diplomacy does *n't* *reflect* its past behavior
negotiators should draw lessons from @entity29 talks , @entity244 says
essential negotiators make use of leverage over @entity10 , he says
