-- @entity1 and @entity2 recently announced their $ 11 billion merger			1
is this the kiss of death to the legacy airline industry , which after the merger will only have three major carriers : @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity1 ? will the merger reduce consumer choices and increase prices ? is this another proof that airline deregulation is a big mistake and a sellout to corporate interests ? rest assured -- there 's no reason to panic			1
according to the @entity23 , the average round - trip ticket ( net of fees paid at the airport , including baggage fees and on - board fees such as meals , both of which are important sources of new revenues ) increased by 28 % since 1995			0
in contrast , average retail prices in the same time frame increased by 47 % , which means that the average air fare fell in real terms by about 15 %			0
at the same time , crude oil prices ( a key factor in airline costs ) increased by a factor of 5 , from around $ 17 per barrel to more than $ 90 per barrel			1
during this period , we saw many legacy airlines disappear , mostly through mergers			1
@entity47 -- the fourth major legacy -- was acquired by @entity1 in 2001			1
@entity49 was absorbed by then bankrupt @entity2 in 2005			2
@entity50 merged with @entity9 last year			0
@entity51 , a major new entrant at the national scale since deregulation , took over @entity55 in 2008 and @entity56 in 2010 , which previously absorbed @entity57 , another new airline since deregulation			2
@entity10 purchased @entity59 in 2008			0
although the @entity1 airline industry is more concentrated than the rest of the world , in reality , its competitive nature changed dramatically			1
the entrance of new players at the national stage such as @entity51 , @entity68 , and @entity69 , among many others , as well as the development of strong hub - and - spoke networks among the major airlines , put strong competitive pressure on the majors			0
on the one hand , the new entrants are all nimble			0
@entity51 has been the only consistently profitable airline for 20 years			0
when compared to the majors , they all have lower labor costs , and more modern and standardized equipment -- leading to low operational and fuel costs			0
they tend also to be highly selective in the markets they serve			0
on the other hand , the majors ' strengthening of the hub - and - spoke networks ( by which travelers go from a to b via a hub in airport c ) imply that entry into new markets -- what in the industry is called " city - pairs " -- is relatively simple			0
all a major needs to do is to start service between one hub and a given city to have service to hundreds of new city - pairs , all prior existing cities being suddenly connected to a new destination			0
so if an airline attempts to gouge its customers on a particular destination , other airlines with reasonably located hubs will have a strong incentive to add such destination to their networks , frustrating the gouging airline 's ability to raise prices			2
it is in this framework that the @entity1 - @entity2 merger needs to be looked at			1
although there will be some competitive overlap , particularly at national airports where both @entity1 and @entity2 have a substantial presence ( @entity2 providing the @entity126 service as well as regular service ) , such overlap will be investigated by the antitrust authorities			1
actually , the two networks are quite complementary and will provide consumers with more choices and improved quality of service			1
in particular , @entity134 residents where @entity2 has its major eastern hubs will benefit from increased domestic and international connections			2
although the combined airline may decide to streamline some of its hubs , other hubs , such as @entity142 ( which is a strong @entity51 hub ) , will provide the combined airline with a strong competitive position to recapture some of the market the majors lost to @entity51 over the years ( @entity2 competes today with @entity51 in about 80 % of its routes )			1
overall , this merger , the last of the large airlines ' merger wave , has the potential of being not only good for shareholders and airline employees , but to domestic travelers alike			1
it 's not a bad deal			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity162 .			2

@entity1 and @entity2 recently announced their $ 11 billion merger
@entity166 : is this the kiss of death to the legacy airline industry ?
he says consumers will likely get more choices and improved quality of service
@entity162 : this merger , the last of the large airlines ' merger wave , is good overall
