-- @entity1 would be remembered as the greatest female cyclist of her generation even if she had never been an @entity4 champion			1
@entity5 - @entity1 : fourth time lucky in @entity6 in 1996			2
for much of her career , the @entity4 gold was the one honor to elude the @entity12 rider			1
misfortune , it seemed , was to be her fate every four years , regardless of how many world championships she won in between			0
in 1984 the first women 's @entity4 road race coincided with @entity1 's rise to dominance in the sport			1
well - placed going into the final lap , she appeared set to challenge in the sprint , only to be knocked off in a collision			0
by 1988 , @entity1 was a three - time road race world champion , as well as a double winner of the women 's @entity28 , and the clear favorite for gold in @entity32			1
but a broken hip a month before the @entity34 derailed her preparations			0
although she recovered enough to ride the road race , she could manage just 21st place			2
tactical error more disappointment followed in @entity40 in 1992 as @entity1 paid the price for a tactical error			0
with three kilometers to go , she raced away from the peloton and crossed the line in celebration			0
but she had failed to realize that @entity46 , an unheralded @entity47 , had slipped away from the lead group apparently unnoticed with a lap to go , and finished 20 seconds further in front			0
four years later , in @entity6 , @entity5 - @entity1 , finally cracked her @entity4 jinx			1
at 37 , @entity1 was no longer the dominant presence she had once been , but she still possessed the ability to raise her performance for the biggest races , as she had proven by winning her fourth road race world title in 1995			1
her preparations were typically unorthodox -- while her rivals were acclimatizing to the @entity6 heat , @entity1 trained alone in the mountains of @entity61 , arriving just two days before the race			0
the race itself was run in a sudden downpour , which sent many riders crashing and skidding and had the rest struggling to stay on their bikes			0
unruffled , @entity1 broke clear with two other riders and then launched her gold - winning solo attack 11 kilometers from the finish			2
@entity1 was back for her fifth and final olympics in @entity73 in 2000 at the age of 41 , this time claiming bronze in the time trial -- and event in which she had also won silver in 1996			1

@entity84 's @entity4 record : 1 gold medal , 2 silver medals , 1 bronze medal
cyclist was born *october* *31* , 1958 , in @entity90 , @entity12
by 1988 @entity1 was a three - time road race world champion
