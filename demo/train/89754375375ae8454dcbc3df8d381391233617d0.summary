-- the funeral of the @entity3 leader @entity2 unfolded across the snow - laden streets of @entity6 on wednesday , a three - hour event that displayed the secretive regime 's ability to choreograph elaborate state ceremonies			1
a @entity3 state television broadcast of the services showed a tearful @entity13 , the son and chosen successor of @entity2 , trudging through the snow alongside the procession as it began at the @entity17 , where @entity2 's body had been lying in state since his death earlier this month			1
one black car carried on its roof a coffin draped in the flag of the nation 's @entity25			1
another transported a giant portrait of a smiling @entity2			0
senior officials accompanied the younger @entity2 , including @entity30 , his uncle and a vice chairman of the @entity33			0
soldiers stood with their heads bowed , their caps in hand			0
their green uniforms contrasted starkly with the bright white snow as mournful music played			0
the long funeral cortege then sped up , weaving through the streets of the city past throngs of emotional mourners			2
in footage that the state television repeated several times , the mourners wailed and beat their chests , their hair damp from the falling snow			2
" that is our general , " said one soldier interviewed by the station			1
" in this snow , we have to send him off and it 's heart ripping			1
" the snow also gave the country 's state - run media fresh material with which to eulogize the dead leader			1
" the feathery snowfall reminds the @entity3 people of the snowy day when the leader was born in the secret camp of @entity69			0
@entity75 and of the great revolutionary career that he followed through snowdrifts , " the @entity70 said in a report wednesday , referring to a mythical tale of @entity2 's birth on a sacred mountain			2
the @entity3 media had attributed a number of supernatural feats and events to @entity2 over his lifetime			0
" all streets in @entity6 and all towns and villages throughout the country are now inundated with people sweeping away snow before bidding their last farewell to the leader , " the @entity70 report said			0
" they , who spent a sleepless night , missing him , have turned out in all roads covered by him in his lifetime			0
" the funeral procession , consisting of dozens of cars , went as far as @entity98 , named after the founder of @entity3 and father of @entity2 , before returning to the palace			1
at that point , soldiers fired a 21 - shot salute as @entity13 and other officials stood with their heads bowed			1
the reclusive nation had revealed no details ahead of time about the funeral of the elder @entity2 , who was revered as a godlike " dear leader " by his people			2
he died december 17 -- reportedly of a heart attack -- after 17 years of repressive rule			2
analysts were parsing the funeral footage for clues on the transition under way within the regime			2
the route the procession took appeared to follow that taken for @entity126 's funeral in 1994 , reported @entity127 , the official @entity128 news agency			1
but @entity2 received three fewer shots in the salute than his father did			0
the funeral wednesday gave a prominent role to a third generation of the family : @entity13 , the man designated the " great successor " by the nation 's @entity25			1
" this is a very scripted funeral			2
they 've expected this for the last several years , " said @entity138 , dean of the @entity139 at @entity140 in @entity141			0
" as you can see by the clockwork procession , the funeral basically signals a new era in @entity3 " under @entity13 , @entity138 said			1
questions have been raised about @entity13 's ability to take the reins of the communist nation , given his young age -- he is thought to be in his late 20s -- and relative inexperience			1
state news media have described the younger @entity2 as " @entity156 " and " @entity157 of the 21st century , " suggesting he is succeeding in rallying support within the regime 's hierarchy			1
" as far as we can see from the tv cameras and from all of their state media projections , everything basically is going according to plan , " @entity138 said			1
" @entity167 will be able to remain in power over the longer term -- that 's the $ 64 million question			2
" analysts were also watching the ceremonies to gauge where leading figures stand in the new hierarchy			0
@entity30 , who was shown walking behind @entity13 on wednesday , is expected to serve as a regent for the younger @entity2 as he builds leadership experience , said @entity178 , a @entity3 analyst at the @entity179 in @entity180			1
@entity181 , who holds a number of key military and political posts , also took a prominent position in the procession			0
the ceremony is to be followed by a memorial on thursday			0
the state - run @entity70 said when the national memorial service is held , gun volleys will be fired in the capital as well as in provincial seats			0
" all the people will observe three minutes ' silence and all locomotives and ships ( those on voyage included ) will blow whistles and those units with sirens will sound them all at once , " @entity70 said			0
