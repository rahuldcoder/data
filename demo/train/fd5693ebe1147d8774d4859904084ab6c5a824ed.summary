in a human rights report , these can seem like distant concepts or dry statistics , but when told by the people who experience them first hand , they take on new meaning			1
that is why @entity12 officials invited two young @entity14 defectors to address a crowd at the @entity16 on wednesday -- to share their personal experiences of abuse at the hands one of the world 's most notorious regimes			1
@entity24 's family was part of @entity14 's ruling elite			1
her early life was comfortable , and her family even enjoyed access to smuggled @entity31 films and @entity33 television shows			0
from these , @entity24 said , she learned how different life could be in other places , and she started to feel more repressed by the government 's rules			0
" i remember wanting to be like @entity39 after watching the @entity40 , " @entity24 said			0
" but in @entity14 , the regime restricts even what i can wear , so instead i made paper dolls and i made the clothes that i wanted to wear for them			1
" when she was nine years old , @entity24 remembers that one of friend 's mothers was arrested for sharing dvds and was publicly executed			0
the experience , she said , shocked her			0
many people in her world participated in the underground economy , including her father , a government official			0
in 2004 , he was arrested for illegal trading , and was severely beaten			0
@entity24 and her mother were ostracized , and fled to @entity61 where they underwent further hardships as one of countless @entity14 immigrants , and she saw her mother raped			1
after a harrowing journey on foot to @entity70 , they finally made it to @entity33 , where @entity72 is now a university student			0
@entity74 also grew up new the @entity61 - @entity14 border			1
after famine hit the region , @entity74 's family struggled to find enough food to eat			0
" hunger is humiliation , " @entity74 told the audience at the @entity16			2
" he watched his father die of starvation , after which his mother and sister left for @entity61 to find work			0
" at the time i was so young and naive it never occurred to me that it might -- they might never be able to make it back , " said @entity74			0
he never saw his sister again			0
his mother sold his sister to a man in @entity61 , thinking her fate there would be less cruel than a life back in @entity14			1
" this is my first time saying that in public , " @entity74 said wednesday after relaying the story , " mostly because i was afraid that people would judge my mom for what she did			0
" " but i realized this is an important part of my story , that i hope illustrates how difficult and desperate the life is , " @entity74 continued , " and how many @entity14 mothers were forced to make this kind of heartbreaking decision			2
" the event at the @entity16 is just the latest in a string of events aimed at drawing attention towards @entity14 's dismal human rights record , as the international community works towards shaming , and potentially prosecuting officials there			1
last month , a @entity125 committee approved a draft resolution recommending the @entity127 take action against @entity14 over a slew of human rights abuses			1
that resolution , which is non-binding but symbolically important , is expected to come up for a vote in the @entity133 this month			0
earlier this year , the @entity125 @entity134 on @entity135 published a detailed 400 - page report documenting abuses , which it submitted to the @entity127 for review along with recommendation that @entity14 officials face prosecution			1
that report accused the government of murder , kidnapping , torture , slavery , sexual violence , mass starvation and other abuses			2
it includes personal testimonies from people who experienced life inside @entity14 's infamous prison camps , including that of a woman who claims a fellow female inmate was forced to drown her own baby in a bucket			2
testimonies also reveal how prisoners suffered from chronic hunger , and would sometimes resort to eating rodents and lizards to survive			0
following the release of the report , @entity165 , the committee 's chairman , told reporters : " the suffering and tears of the people of @entity14 demand action			1
" the @entity14 government is sensitive to accusations against them , and is quick deny these reports as they emerge			2
representatives have claimed the @entity12 and its allies are fabricating abuse claims to justify meddling in @entity14 's internal affairs			1
in september , @entity14 's @entity182 came out with its own rights report , which proclaims that @entity14 has " the world 's most advantageous human rights system , " and makes no mention of the country 's infamous forced labor camps			1
the @entity14 government has also called out the @entity12 government for what they see as hypocrisy when it comes to human rights abuses -- particularly in light of a new report released by the @entity196 on tuesday , which details how the @entity197 tortured terror detainees			1
@entity14 's state - run news agency @entity199 said the use of such enhanced interrogation techniques is " inhuman " and called on the @entity125 to investigate those offenses			1
and according to @entity72 , the @entity14 government views it as essential to control the narrative when it comes to information in the public sphere if it hopes to maintain the image of @entity209 as an all - powerful leader			2
this was demonstrated recently when @entity14 demanded @entity212 stop the release of the upcoming movie " @entity215 , " a comedy starring @entity217 and @entity218 , whose characters are tasked by the @entity197 to assassinate @entity209			1
the @entity14 government came under suspicion after @entity212 's systems were infiltrated by anonymous hackers			2
" i did n't even see the movie yet , " @entity24 said wednesday when she was asked about the film 's potential impact			0
" but it will be a really big sensation in @entity14 if they see that movie			2

international pressure is *mounting* on @entity14 when it comes to human rights abuses
