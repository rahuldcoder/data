@entity0 -- amid the celebrations that greeted the declaration of a winner in @entity8 's first freely elected presidential vote , a @entity3 student journalist was being sexually assaulted by a mob in @entity10			1
@entity11 recounted the experience on her blog and in an interview with @entity1			1
@entity11 , who has since left @entity8 , wrote that the moving demonstrations of freedom turned to horror " in a split second " when dozens of frenzied men dragged her away from two male companions and began to grope her " with increasing force and aggression			1
" " men started ripping off all my clothes , " she told @entity1			1
" first of all , it was my skirt , and that just went straight away , and i did n't even feel my underwear being removed			0
then my shoes went and clothes on my upper half were just being ripped off me , and that was quite painful			2
" during the assault , " i was just in this weird , detached state of mind , and i just kept saying , ' please @entity34 , please make it stop			0
please , @entity34 , make it stop			0
' " her experience echoes the assaults faced by two prominent female reporters , @entity43 correspondent @entity42 and @entity8 - @entity45 columnist @entity44 , who has said her attackers were officers at a police station			1
one of @entity11 's friends , @entity49 , told @entity1 the mob dragged @entity11 naked across the ground before another group of men stepped in to protect her			1
" there were several moments at which i thought she was going to die , " @entity49 said			1
" and i think that really the fact that we are still alive , and especially @entity11 's still alive , was because there were so many people who were willing to help us and were willing to risk their own lives and put them in direct danger to get her out of that situation			1
" @entity11 was on her first international assignment , shooting a documentary on women 's rights in @entity8 as her final college project			1
a doctor who treated @entity11 and a @entity3 @entity72 official who met her at the hospital corroborrated her account for @entity1			1
" if there had n't been a small group of men around me , i would have been raped and killed , " she said			2
" that 's just without question , because that 's what the men were trying to do			2
it was very clear what they were trying to do to me			0
they were n't just trying to play around with me , they were gunning for me for whatever reason			0
" on her blog , she wrote that an ambulance pulled up at one point , but it was forced to leave when it " was invaded by tens of men			2
" even after being escorted to a medical tent by volunteers who formed a cordon around her , her attackers surrounded the tent			0
women who assisted her told her the attack " was motivated by rumors spread by troublemaking thugs that i was a foreign spy , following a national advertising campaign warning of the dangers of foreigners			0
" " @entity108 women , @entity106 women were all around me , just crying , saying ' this is not @entity8 ! this is not @entity8 ! this is not @entity112 ! these are thugs ! ' " she told @entity1			1
she said she responded , " i know , i love @entity8 , i know this is not @entity112 , it 's ok			1
" and they were stunned , ' cause they thought i was going to be so full of hate and so full of fear			0
but from the very beginning , i do n't blame @entity8 for this			2
this is not the workings of the @entity8 people			2
" to escape , she said , " i was told i had to put my trust in this @entity8 man			1
i was disguised in a burqa and let out of this tent with this man , barefoot and i had to pretend to be his wife and walk through the streets and he kept just saying to me , ' do n't cry			0
if you cry , people will know			0
' " on her blog , she complained about her treatment at the hospital , noting that the doctor 's first question was whether she was married , " which is of course the most important question to be asking a victim of mass sexual abuse			0
" " he and a female nurse ( who only reluctantly kept me covered up ) looked briefly at the damage and just wandered off , saying that because i did n't have internal bleeding , they could n't do anything , " she wrote			0
" a useful trip , that was			0
" but the doctor , @entity153 , said @entity11 's account may be " a misunderstanding , because she was here first time to enter the @entity8 hospital			1
" @entity11 said her case will get attention " because i 'm @entity3 and i 'm young and i 'm a girl , " but she said other @entity8 women " will often suffer these attacks and worse attacks and there 'll be no justice done			1
" " there 's been an outpouring of support , and i 'm so grateful for that , " she said			0
but she said she wished that support could be shared with " all women , of all nationalities , wherever they are			0
" " i 'll be so happy if this could make any difference to other women who are in this situation , not just in @entity8 , not just in the @entity178 , but everywhere , " she said			2
@entity1 's @entity179 in @entity180 contributed to this report .			0
