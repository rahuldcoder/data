@entity35 took the column over full time in august 2002 , when the family announced that @entity3 had @entity8 's			1

eat less ; chew more			2
talk less ; say more			2
hate less ; love more			0
" what was your favorite @entity6 advice ? before the digital era of journalism introduced such notions as " crowd sourcing " of the public and computerized metrics on readership , @entity13 assembled her q&a columns from queries mailed in from readers			1
she was able to quantify her following by the number of newspapers who bought her columns -- and by how many readers spent money on a stamp to mail her a letter			0

@entity6 : @entity13 remembers her mentor editor @entity132 " wanted only to get this self - styled journalist out of his office , so he asked her to write sample replies to some previously published columns			1
