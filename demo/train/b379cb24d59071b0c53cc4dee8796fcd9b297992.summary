defense attorneys for @entity1 are expected to present their final arguments in @entity3 thursday continuing an effort to to counter prosecutors ' portrayal of her as a cunning " femme fatale			1
" @entity10 's attorneys statements thursday follow arguments presented earlier this week by the lawyer of her co-defendant			1
lawyer @entity15 said on tuesday that @entity10 is not the character the media has painted her as and urged a jury to acquit @entity10 and his client , @entity19 , of murdering @entity20			1
@entity15 compared @entity10 to the voluptuous cartoon character @entity23 , who protests , " i 'm not bad , i 'm just drawn that way , " in the movie " @entity26 ? " @entity15 , who represents @entity19 -- @entity10 's former boyfriend -- said the whole trial was based on dna evidence " on which mistakes were made , " and urged the jury to " abandon imagined fantasies " and acquit the pair			1
@entity10 and @entity19 are fighting their conviction for killing @entity36 -- @entity10 's roommate -- in @entity38 , @entity3 , in 2007			1
@entity10 and @entity19 were convicted in 2009			1
@entity10 was sentenced to 26 years in prison , while @entity19 got 25			1
as she began her closing arguments tuesday , @entity15 said there was no physical trace of @entity10 or @entity19 in the room where @entity36 was found murdered			1
" the room speaks only of @entity46 , the other man convicted separately of killing @entity36 , @entity15 told the jury			0
@entity10 and @entity19 's defense teams have suggested @entity46 , who is already serving a 16 - year sentence for the murder , could have been the sole killer			1
evidence that @entity46 was in the room shows that " no one could enter that room and not leave any trace , " said @entity15 , who represents @entity19			2
she urged the jury to think about her client as they made their decision			0
" the lives of this kid and his parents have been destroyed			0
you must today evaluate if - if - if these kids committed the crime , " @entity15 told jurors			0
@entity15 , one the highest - profile lawyers in @entity3 , attacked media coverage of the trial as sensational , saying it could have affected what witnesses told the court			2
she rejected the notion that @entity10 and @entity19 were into violent sex , saying they rubbed noses in " eskimo kisses			1
" the lawyer also attacked the circumstances under which @entity10 was interrogated by police the night of the murder , saying she was interrogated by " hostile " officers , which made it impossible to trust what she said that night			1
" if one is not calm , anything can happen , " @entity15 argued			0
and she hammered home attacks on dna evidence that have been a key part of the appeal			0
she said police could have contaminated the crime scene or the evidence , playing video from the police investigation itself to make her point			0
@entity10 and @entity19 are appealing the convictions together , having been convicted in a joint trial			1
both defendants were in court tuesday , with @entity10 in a long - sleeved pink sweater and @entity19 in a long - sleeved prune - colored shirt			1
their parents were in court as well			0
on monday , the lawyer for @entity36 's family showed photos of the @entity109 murder victim 's bloodied body , pointing out multiple stab wounds			1
he urged the @entity3 jury not to overturn @entity10 and @entity19 's convictions			1
" i show you these pictures to show you the pain of @entity20 , " @entity113 said			0
" she did n't have defensive wounds			0
it means that she was tied up , that she had more than one aggressor , " the lawyer said			0
" given the type , number and locations of the wounds , there had to be multiple attackers , " he insisted , rejecting the defense theory that @entity46 acted alone			0
he attacked as " useless " a review of dna evidence that may cast doubt on the original convictions			0
@entity10 avoided looking at the photographs of @entity36 's body as they were shown			1
lawyers for the civil suits related to the case presented their closing arguments monday			2
at the hearing , another lawyer called @entity10 two - faced and " diabolical			2
" " within her lives a double soul : one which is angelic , good , compassionate ... tender and ingenuous , " @entity143 said			0
but she had another side , he said : " a @entity147 - like , demonic , satanic , diabolical one which sometimes leads her to borderline and dissolute behavior , " saying that was the @entity10 who had killed her roommate			2
@entity143 sought to portray @entity10 as sexually promiscuous and a difficult roommate as he fights for damages for his client , @entity20			2
@entity10 accused @entity156 of the murder in 2007			2
he was arrested but released after his alibi checked out			0
he later sued @entity10 for libel , winning 40,000 euros ( $ 54,000 ) in damages			2
a verdict in the appeal could come as soon as october 1 .			0

the case is *adjourned* to thursday , when @entity10 's lawyers will give their final arguments
