-- mammoth cruise ships can be difficult to get around , even in the best of circumstances			2
in the worst -- which is how one might describe the situation aboard the listing @entity6 -- they are near impossible			1
yet even before the sun rose monday , about 120 rescue personnel were out in or around the liner that hit rocks near @entity12 and rolled spectacularly on its side			1
they were in a race against time , and in a battle with numerous challenges , to try to save survivors or at least recover the bodies of the passengers and crew members who are still missing			2
overheard on @entity0 : worst - case scenario the search was temporarily suspended by noon monday , after authorities said the vessel had begun to sway , making it dangerous for the crews			1
but it resumed a short time later , despite a forecast calling for increasingly strong winds that @entity30 spokesman @entity30 said had rescuers worried			2
they are " working in very , very bad conditions , " said @entity32 of @entity34 's national fire service			2
" it 's cold , of course			2
it 's dark during the day and the night			2
... it 's really , really dangerous			0
" authorities have said that at least six people died after the @entity6 hit rocks friday night off the tiny island of @entity45 , where nighttime temperatures have recently dipped below freezing			1
a total of 29 people -- four crew members and 25 passengers -- are still unaccounted for from the listing cruise ship , @entity34 coast guard chief @entity53 said monday , according to @entity34 's @entity55 news agency			1
that figure includes two of the 120 @entity57 who were aboard the ship , the @entity57 @entity56 in @entity34 said			1
now turned on its side , the ship is roughly half - submerged			1
rescuers hope is that any survivor has found refuge above water , or perhaps in an air pocket , and can be brought out alive			0
" there could still be people locked into compartments ... where they ca n't physically move because of the twisting of the metal , " said @entity67 , president of the diving safety company @entity68			1
in its current state , the @entity6 resembles a dark , convoluted cave -- with its countless nooks and crannies and few ways to easily escape			1
six underwater cave rescue divers are working among the rescue personnel			1
the divers are likely equipped with twice as much oxygen as regular scuba divers , have a guideline nearby in case they need help finding a way back to safety , and have knives and whatever lights they can carry or wear , said @entity92 , a co-founder of the @entity93			0
still , whatever equipment and precautions they take , " what they are doing is extremely difficult , " he said			0
" if you do not have the right frame of mind to deal with being in the dark and in tight closed spaces , then you 're ( in trouble ) , " said @entity92 , who has dived in many caves and ships , though neither he nor his group are involved in the @entity34 operation			1
unlike open water divers , these divers do n't have the luxury of coming up for air anytime they want , and they ca n't count on the help of sunlight			0
@entity92 said he expects that , besides being pitch - black , the water in the ship teems with debris			1
" they could swim right by a dead body and not even see it , " @entity92 said			0
rescuers are navigating a seeming labyrinth			0
the @entity6 is practically a skyscraper in two directions : 17 decks high and 951 feet long			1
emergency personnel are aiming to look into 1,500 cabins and all around the ship 's many other public spaces , including eight bars , five restaurants , four swimming pools , a casino and more			1
@entity67 , a veteran of many such rescue dives , estimated it could take a couple of weeks for the whole ship to be checked			1
" it 's enormous , " said @entity139 , another member of the @entity34 national fire corps			0
" they have to stay safe , and it takes them a long time to go down a corridor			1
" late sunday , the cruise line said the ship 's captain may have made " significant " errors leading to the wreck and subsequent rescue effort			1
" the route of the vessel appears to have been too close to the shore , and the captain 's judgment in handling the emergency appears to have not followed standard @entity6 procedures , " @entity152 said in a statement			1
authorities told @entity55 that the captain , @entity163 , has been detained for alleged manslaughter , causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship while passengers were still on board			1
speaking on @entity34 television , @entity169 insisted the rocks were not marked on his map			0
" on the nautical chart , it was marked just as water , " @entity169 said , adding that the ship was about 300 meters ( 1,000 feet ) from shore			1
but the @entity34 coast guard insisted that the waters where the ship ran aground were well - mapped			1
local fishermen say the island coast of @entity45 is known for its rocky sea floor			0
" every danger in this area is on the nautical chart , " @entity183 capt. @entity182 said			0
" this is a place where a lot of people come for diving and sailing			1
... all the dangers are known			0
" survivors recounted a frantic rush by passengers to get on lifeboats , while the crew appeared helpless and unable to cope			0
" it was the @entity202 brothers , watching these guys trying to figure out how to work the boat , " said passenger @entity197 , recounting how he made his own rope ladder to save himself and his wife			0
" i felt like the disaster itself was manageable , but i felt like the crew was going to kill us			0
" compounding the evacuation problems was that only one side of the boat 's lifeboats was available , as the ship was listing			2
passenger @entity213 , from @entity214 , @entity215 , said some lifeboats on the higher side got stuck , leaving people suspended in mid-air amid the sounds of children crying and screaming			2
" it was so crowded , and there was no room for us , " said @entity222 , who was sailing with his siblings			0
" it was just bad , like mad scrambles to get into the lifeboats			0
" many questions remain : why was the ship -- with about 3,000 passengers and 1,000 crew members -- so close in to shore in an area where the seabed is pockmarked with rocks ? what happened in the minutes after the ship ran aground ? why was no " mayday " distress signal sent ? " looking at the pictures of the damage , it almost looks as if they saw it at the last minute , and they tried to swing the ship to the right to miss , " said @entity244 , professor of naval architecture at the @entity245			2
whatever happened to cause the crash , what 's happening now to deal with its aftermath -- and , ideally , get to those still on board -- is now the focus			0
those rescue crews have to deal with not just myriad logistical difficulties , but also physical and mental challenges			2
emergency personnel in the open - air part of the ship need ropes to get around , because the floor has become the wall in most cases			2
whether they are rappelling or swimming , doors may have to be opened upward , not the standard way , given the position of the ship			2
" the doors are very heavy , and the windows are very thick , so it 's quite difficult to break them , " said @entity32 of the national fire service			0
making one 's way around without light and where everything is turned on its side can test even the toughest person 's mental makeup			0
@entity92 , of the @entity93 , notes that many cave diver deaths " are attributed to panic			0
" even those not underwater face situations in which even a small slip - up can be life threatening , he said			0
despite such challenges , @entity32 vowed that rescue personnel were prepared and intent on continuing their mission as long as necessary			1
" they keep on working until we are sure that no person is missing , " he said			0
" the conditions are very tough , but we can manage it			0
