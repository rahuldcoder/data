-- the @entity2 government has angered koala conservationists by again delaying a decision on whether to add the national icon to the country 's endangered species list			1
last year , a @entity13 inquiry into the status , health and sustainability of @entity11 's koala population heard that there could be as few as 43,000 koalas left in the country			1
millions have been killed since the arrival of @entity21 settlers in the 18th century			0
numbers were slashed again during open hunting seasons in the early 20th century and in recent decades tens of thousands have died as a result of habitat destruction , disease -- including @entity28 and retrovirus -- and dog attacks			1
on average , four koalas are admitted every week to @entity32 , the country 's largest wildlife hospital , after being hit by cars			2
the animals are also vulnerable to bushfires and drought			0
however , environment minister @entity39 says he needs 10 more weeks to consider new information from the @entity41 ( @entity41 ) on where the marsupial is under the greatest threat			1
it 's the second time he 's delayed the decision , which was initially due in october			2
" i ca n't provide a blanket threatened species listing across @entity11 when there are many places where koala numbers remain high , " he said in a statement			1
while the @entity13 report found there had been a " marked decline " in @entity11 's national koala population -- with the largest losses reported in the states of @entity59 and @entity60 -- it said that in some areas of @entity63 and @entity11 koala colonies were " flourishing			1
" some say the disparity between survival rates in different parts of the country is complicating what should be a simple decision to grant koalas greater protection			2
" in the @entity13 documents there was n't one submission that said the koala as safe			0
not one , " said @entity77 , chief executive of the @entity78 , a non-profit organization dedicated to saving the species			0
currently , koalas are listed as " vulnerable " under state legislation in @entity59 and @entity60 , and as " rare " in @entity11			1
however , they are currently not granted any extra protection under federal law			0
campaigners say a national listing is necessary because state governments have clearly failed to stop population declines			1
a national listing would offer greater protection to the koala under @entity11 's @entity93 and @entity94 ( @entity95 ) @entity92			1
currently , more than 1,700 species and ecological communities face the threat of extinction , according to government figures			0
@entity77 said the federal environment minister 's decision to delay his verdict was a deliberate tactic to avoid it becoming an issue before the upcoming @entity59 state election on march 24			2
most koalas in the state are found in the south - east near the capital @entity110 , a growing city which is suffering a shortage of affordable housing			2
" we are absolutely convinced it has nothing to do with koala biology			0
it has to do with politics and i 'm ashamed of our minister , " @entity77 said			0
" there 's nothing that they could gather in 10 more weeks that has n't been gathered by a 200 - strong page @entity13 report that says the koala is in trouble			0
" " the data that we have presented -- and 100 other submissions -- has taken us 25 years to gather and 26,000 man hours			0
so unless minister @entity39 has a group of volunteers scouring the bush looking for koalas , this 10 - week delay is nonsense , " she said			1
@entity39 's office denied the delay was politically motivated and said that the minister was seeking more precise information on habitat boundaries			1
the minister says he does n't expect the decision to be delayed beyond april 30			0
the question of whether koalas should be considered endangered has been considered three times in the last 15 years by the @entity41 ( @entity41 )			1
each time , the committee found there was not enough data on koala populations to conclude that populations had fallen far enough to reach the threshold needed to declare them endangered under federal law			2
internationally , the koala is listed as of " least concern " on the @entity158 's @entity157			0
however , the @entity159 considers the marsupial a threatened species .			0

campaigners are *urging* koalas to be considered endangered
as few as 43,000 of the national icons are left in @entity11
habitat loss , disease , car *accidents* and dogs are killing them
minister says he needs more time to consider new information
