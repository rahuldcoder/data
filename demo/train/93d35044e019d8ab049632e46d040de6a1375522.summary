-- parents ' prescription - drug use has dangerous implications for kids			2
a recent study published in the journal @entity7 shows that the rise in prescription - medication use among @entity11 adults has led to more poisonings among children -- despite efforts to prevent that outcome			1
the phenomenon is so concerning that researchers are advising pediatricians to talk with parents about how to safely store prescription drugs away from kids of all ages			2
the investigators write that despite public - health interventions like educational campaigns and the introduction of child - resistant medicine bottles , between 2001 and 2008 , pediatric emergency - department visits due to medication exposures increased 30 % , while the rate of hospitalizations increased 36 %			1
simultaneously , the number of @entity11 adults using prescription medications has also gone up			1
researchers decided to explore whether there is a connection between the two			0
their findings do n't look good for child safety			0
research shows that more children are being exposed to medications not intended for them , and that most of these poisonings come from consuming prescription drugs vs. over-the - counter ones			1
most of these drug exposures happen in a child 's home , from medications belonging to an adult relative			2
@entity0 : study : internet access may increase prescription - drug misuse the researchers looked at two databases and compared monthly pediatric poisonings with the number of adult drug prescriptions from 2000 to 2009			1
during those years , there was a rise in adult prescriptions for diabetes drugs , statins and other lipid - lowering medications as well as beta - blockers and opioids			0
they noted a significant association between the rise in adult prescriptions for those drugs -- including hypoglycemics , antihyperlipidemics , b - blockers , and opioids -- and poisonings among children for those specific medications			0
the strongest link between drugs and emergency - department visits for pediatric poisonings was connected to lipid medications and beta - blockers			1
serious injuries and hospitalizations occurred most often for opioids and diabetes medications			0
children under age 5 had the highest risk of poisonings , followed by 13 - to 19 - year - olds			0
for young kids , medication poisonings are more commonly caused by unintentional consumption , but for teens , it 's more likely from recreational use			1
it 's not enough to keep prescription meds out of the reach of young kids ; households with teens should be equally mindful of where those drugs are stored to avoid harm and overdose from risky behavior			1
@entity0 : more kids accidentally ingesting marijuana following new drug policies the authors suggest that although public - health initiatives , like the 2008 @entity114 and @entity115 , may be effective , kids are still being exposed at greater levels			0
" pediatricians should consult parents of patients on storing medications , focusing on how exposures vary based on the child 's age and intention			0
physicians prescribing drugs to adults should also be aware of the potential risk of exposures to children and provide guidance accordingly , " the authors write			0
unfortunately , adult prescription - drug use is unlikely to fall anytime soon , especially given the high obesity rates in the @entity11 many of the drugs specifically implicated in the study , like antihyperlipidemics , oral hypoglycemics and b - blockers , are taken to treat obesity - related conditions			1
the researchers conclude that based on their findings , there 's a growing need for improved interventions for prescription - drug ingestion , including more age - specific prevention strategies			2

more @entity11 adults are using prescription medication
that 's led to more emergency room visits for medication exposure
teens ' poisonings may result from recreational use instead of accidents
