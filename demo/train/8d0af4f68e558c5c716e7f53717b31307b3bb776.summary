-- outrage over the reported discovery of the bodies of almost 800 children at a former home for unmarried mothers run by nuns in @entity8 prompted calls wednesday for a full investigation			1
the children whose remains have apparently been found in @entity13 , in @entity14 , are believed to have died between 1925 and 1961 , according to local media reports			1
the grim discovery was highlighted in a front - page report in the @entity18 , which cited the efforts of local historian @entity20 to research the burial sites of 796 children listed as having died at the home , which was run by the @entity23			1
according to the newspaper , @entity20 believes their remains are all buried in the unmarked mass grave next to the place where the home once stood			2
local children stumbled upon the grave in the 1970s , local media reported , but the site was never examined afterward			1
the revelation has sparked calls for an investigation and renewed questions about the treatment of unmarried mothers and their children by the @entity40 and institutions associated with it			1
sgt. @entity45 , in the press office of @entity44 , @entity8 's national police , told @entity0 there was nothing to suggest any impropriety and that police are not investigating the matter			2
@entity45 also disputed media reports that remains were found in a septic tank			2
the skeletal remains were found in a graveyard in the grounds of the home , he said			2
minister for children and youth affairs @entity58 said in a statement wednesday that " active consideration " is being given to how to address the details that have emerged about the burial of children who died in homes for unmarried mothers			2
" many of the revelations are deeply disturbing and a shocking reminder of a darker past in @entity8 when our children were not cherished as they should have been , " he said			2
government departments are working together to establish the best course of action , said @entity58			0
' @entity76 ' opposition parties @entity77 and @entity79 urged a comprehensive government inquiry into the matter			0
" the news that the remains of some 800 babies were found on convent grounds in @entity13 has shocked citizens , " said party leader @entity82 in an online statement wednesday			1
" this case warrants an immediate full public inquiry into the neglect and maltreatment which caused the deaths of these children			0
" unfortunately , this case is really just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the treatment of women and children in mother and baby homes			0
" @entity103 , a @entity79 lawmaker in @entity104 , insisted that @entity8 's prime minister -- or @entity106 -- @entity107 , must take a lead in investigating the reports			0
" these shocking revelations about the appalling treatment of hundreds of babies and their mothers must be dealt with by the highest levels in @entity115 , " he said			0
" we need to hear from the @entity106 today about the government 's plans to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of these children , the dumping of their remains , the treatment of their mothers and the @entity127 's role in the activities at this home			1
" archbishop : huge emotional wrench a petition set up tuesday on the activist website @entity134 calls for a judicial investigation into the circumstances of the children 's deaths			1
more than 8,000 people had signed it as of thursday morning			0
the petition , which is addressed to the @entity8 minister for justice and equality , says , " we are concerned that evidence suggests that the mortality rate for these children was significantly higher than the national rate of infant mortality at the time			0
" and we are shocked at reliable , contemporaneous accounts that the children were malnourished and seemingly uncared - for , when the @entity8 was paying the @entity151 to look after them			0
" archbishop @entity152 , who heads the @entity13 archdiocese , welcomed the government 's move to examine what happened at the home -- and said it was hard to fathom the suffering of the mothers involved			1
" i was greatly shocked , as we all were , to learn of the extent of the numbers of children buried in the graveyard in @entity13 , " he said in a statement			1
" i can only begin to imagine the huge emotional wrench which the mothers suffered in giving up their babies for adoption or by witnessing their death			0
" despite the length of time elapsed , " this is a matter of great public concern which ought to be acted upon urgently , " @entity152 said			0
" it will be a priority for me , in cooperation with the families of the deceased , to seek to obtain a dignified re-interment of the remains of the children in consecrated ground in @entity13			1
" he said the @entity40 would work with the @entity151 and the local community to put up a memorial plaque to the infants who died			1
@entity152 said that the diocese has no documents related to the home , since it was not involved in running it , while the @entity23 handed over their archives to local authorities in 1961			2
he added , " there exists a clear moral imperative on the @entity151 in this case to act upon their responsibilities in the interests of the common good			0
" @entity199 treatment the @entity13 case is the latest high - profile episode in which the state and @entity40 have been called to account over care of the most vulnerable in @entity8 society			1
a government report last year into the so - called @entity206 , run by various @entity40 orders , acknowledged that @entity8 's government sent thousands of women and girls to " harsh and physically demanding " workhouses , where they worked and lived without pay , sometimes for years			1
the laundries operated from 1922 to 1996			0
while some were sent there by courts , others were unmarried mothers , victims of sexual abuse , orphans considered a burden to relatives or the state , or were mentally or physically disabled			0
and earlier this year , @entity228 -- whose decades - long search for the son she was forced to give up for adoption in the 1950s was the subject of an @entity233 - nominated film -- launched the @entity234 in hopes of compelling the governments of @entity8 and the @entity237 to open access to adoption records .			0
