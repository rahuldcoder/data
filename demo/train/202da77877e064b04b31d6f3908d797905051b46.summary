when a man tells me to " trust him , " my typical reaction is to run			1
when he tells me this while trying to get me to jump off a @entity5 mountain with only a paragliding sail to stop me from plummeting to earth , i should run even faster -- even if he does look like @entity8			1
instead , i ignore my irrational fear of heights and rational fear of men using bad cliches , take a running leap then gasp as the sheer terror subsides and i find myself soaring into the @entity16			1
below me the @entity5 countryside unfolds like a map , with stunning views of the peaks of @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , and the waters of @entity26 and @entity27 lakes			2
it turns out the worst part of my first - ever paragliding flight -- made in tandem with an instructor resembling the star of " @entity34 " -- was the apprehension beforehand			1
it took me a while to build up the courage to even sign up for the flight , after but several hours of watching other people effortlessly winging their way over the glaciers from @entity43 to @entity44 , i decided to do it			2
still nervous , i opted for the tamer version of the rides on offer			2
versions aimed at thrill seekers involve extreme aerobatics or high altitude @entity53 - style takeoffs at @entity55 , the 2,970 meter ( 9,700 feet ) peak where " @entity57 " was filmed			1
stuffed penguin there 's even a ride that allows fliers to make a grand entrance at a mountaintop restaurant , but with my aeronautic jitters , i could see this ending in disaster			2
once aloft and floating serenely , i apparently can do no wrong , according to my instructor			2
all i need to do is sit tight , he says , which is just as well considering i feel like a stuffed penguin thanks to the layers of padding i 'm wearing			2
i get a chance to catch my breath and take in the staggeringly huge panoramic vista , which is great as long as i do n't look down too often			2
during the flight , my instructor takes pictures with a wide angle camera attached to an extendable pole , all of which turn out the same thanks to the tortured smile plastered on my face			2
he explains that the trick to staying for long periods is to find rising air currents known as thermals and circle around in them to gain height			1
early mornings , he says , are best as the weather is more predictable			2
after that little tutorial , he offers to show off some nifty tricks			0
we 're in midair , dangling from a scrap of crescent - shaped nylon fabric			1
what could possibly go wrong ? we do a quick , sharp dip to the left , followed by another to the right			0
hit the ground running before my dislodged heart can creep back to its original lodgings , we do a 360 - degree turn			1
the pirouette is fantastic except that even when we stop spinning , my world does n't			0
this is n't an experience for the faint of heart or full of stomach , but we survive to glide peacefully over alpine pastures , tiny chocolate box houses , lakes and grazing sheep			0
to land , we have to stand up in the harness and be prepared to hit the ground running , a fact that gets me panicking all over again			0
" you can do it , " deadpans @entity8			0
the worst that can happen , he says , is i 'll graze a knee or break a leg			0
we manage , though i spoil the effect somewhat by crumpling into a heap and doing an excellent imitation of a beached whale			0
this is n't enough to dampen my spirits though , especially since i 'm now the proud owner of a certificate proving my pluck			0
the spectacular flight over @entity5 will always be a good reminder that one can overcome fear with willpower			0
within reason , of course , i 'm not about to jump off anything attached to a flimsy parachute just yet			0
not even for anyone who looks like @entity8			0
how to get in the air there are several paragliding options involving scenic train rides , gondola rides and thematic flights			1
