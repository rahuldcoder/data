@entity0 -- the @entity2 rescinded its invitation to evangelist @entity4 for the upcoming @entity5 at the @entity6 over controversial remarks he made about @entity8			1
" @entity8 can not be practiced in this country , " he told @entity1 's @entity9 last december			1
" you ca n't beat your wife			2
you can not murder your children if you think they 've committed adultery or something like that , which they do practice in these other countries			0
" @entity4 later tried to temper his remarks by saying that he had @entity21 friends			1
however , the son of famed evangelist @entity23 has a history of comments that bothered the @entity6			1
shortly after the terrorist attacks of september 2001 , for instance , @entity4 called @entity8 a " very evil and wicked religion			1
" @entity4 , who said a prayer at the inauguration of president @entity31 , said he regretted the @entity2 's decision but stood by his comments			1
" i do n't like the way they treat women , the way they treat minorities			0
i just find it horrific			0
but i love the people of @entity8 , " he said , adding some of his work has been in @entity21 nations			2
for instance , @entity43 , the international charity that he heads , works with @entity46 refugees in @entity47			0
" it 's a part of the world i love very much , " @entity4 said			2
" and i understand it			0
but i certainly disagree with their teaching			0
" " i want to express my strong support for the @entity55 military and all our troops , " he said			0
" i 'm very proud of them and it 's just unfortunate that i wo n't be able to participate on may 6th			0
" the @entity2 , which oversees the @entity5 ceremonies at the @entity6 , feared that if @entity4 spoke at the @entity6 , @entity62 militants would publicize his comments , potentially fueling tensions in @entity21 nations like @entity46 and @entity66 , where @entity55 troops are deployed			1
concerns about @entity4 were flagged by the watchdog group @entity69 , which also raised objections that the @entity6 prayer ceremony had become a fundamentalist @entity73 event			1

but @entity4 's supporters disagreed with the @entity2 's decision			1
