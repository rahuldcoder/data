-- could the shop - over be the new buzzword for addicts to serious retail therapy ? this delicious term has been coined by a tour operator that is packaging two - destination holidays with great shopping cities at their core			1
many itineraries put hundreds of miles between the closest shopping mecca and the beach , but @entity15 & @entity16 's @entity14 - @entity13 combination is one of many possible pairings in which a world - class shopping capital and a legendary vacation playground are linked by just a few hours ' drive			1
@entity14 and @entity21 , @entity22 @entity23 suggests a shop - over in @entity14 before chilling out on the romantic and glorious @entity21			2
and the @entity14 is not all about @entity25 , @entity26 and other @entity22 designer stores lining the @entity28 ; @entity23 puts up its guests in @entity30 , a hip neighborhood with some great little boutiques , happening bars and cool restaurants			0
in @entity13 , it 's back to tradition at the @entity37 , converted from a 17th - century monastery			1
like all the most desirable hotels along this coast , it offers fabulous mountainside views over the sea			2
from $ 2,635 , excluding international airfare , for the four - star @entity14 and @entity13 combo : @entity46 @entity47 and @entity48 , @entity49 no one disputes that the @entity51 is the shopping capital of the world , but it 's less well - known that certain hotels have close links with the personal shoppers in @entity58 's most desirable stores			1
the @entity60 concierge can arrange for personal shoppers from @entity62 or @entity63 's to come to the hotel , or you can have your in - store purchases delivered to the hotel at any hour , leaving you unburdened as you head downtown to shop the boutiques of @entity70 and other areas			2
not to mention that the @entity73 apartments have the heady 1930s ambiance of a @entity76 and @entity77 movie			0
from @entity78 , peaceful @entity48 is only a four - hour drive			1
the @entity80 in @entity81 is a serene place to stay in a beautiful village -- and there is more retail therapy not far away at the tony outlet town of @entity87 , @entity48			0
@entity88 and @entity89 , @entity90 you can fly direct to @entity89 's beaches on the west coast of @entity90 , perhaps the most laid - back and eclectic coastal paradise in the world			1
but it 's more fun to take a couple of days to explore the country 's most cosmopolitan and vibrant city , @entity88 -- not least because it 's home to so much great homegrown design the best way to explore the boutiques is to hire a car and driver for half a day and hand over a list of hot addresses			1
these should include @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 , but at a top hotel like the @entity116 , the concierge will know the names of even newer , hotter places shoppers may want to add			0
the hotel has one of the world 's best urban outdoor pools , perfect for post-shop chilling in a hectic town			0
@entity124 and @entity125 , @entity126 @entity124 is such a brilliant shopping city , you 'll be footsore by the time you 've combed the @entity129 and other shopping streets of the trendy @entity131 , not to mention the @entity132 on the @entity133 and the designer haunts of the @entity135			1
a hotel designed specifically for ladies who shop is the @entity138 , with fashion murals in the corridors and in - room macaroons on request			2
kitted out in style , head for the @entity146 station and follow the chic @entity147 taking the train to the twin resorts of @entity150 and @entity151 on the @entity125 coast			2
they 're as different as chalk and cheese ; @entity150 , with its upscale boutiques and boardwalk emblazoned with the names of @entity161 stars , looks like a location for a @entity164 resort catalog			0
@entity151 is laid - back , charming and family - friendly ; do n't miss the fabulous brasserie @entity167 for a dinner that could turn into a wild night			1
you can walk from one town to the other			0
@entity172 and @entity173 , @entity174 @entity172 has some of the most exciting shopping in @entity176 : head for the boutiques of @entity179 , a redeveloped neighborhood of beautiful old buildings retaining a 1920s ambiance , to find some of the most inventive fashion and accessories in @entity174			2
many international designer brands are housed in @entity185 on @entity186 , but it 's more fun to hunt down local designers like @entity190 , whose shoes are @entity174 's @entity192 , on @entity193			0
fashionistas can now stay within a few steps of the boutiques in the @entity197 in @entity179			0
less than two hours ' drive away , the old @entity174 lives on in @entity173 water village , dubbed the @entity172 for its canals			2
the highlight is a picturesque double bridge , with @entity174 gondoliers standing by to ply the waterways			0
the tiny town also has gardens to rival the more famous ones of nearby @entity207 -- but the bigger city has the better hotels			1
a non-cookie - cutter choice with one of the most famous @entity207 gardens on its doorstep , as well as greenery of its own , is the @entity216			2
@entity217 and @entity218 , @entity219 the souks of @entity217 are a shopper 's paradise for everything from embroidered kaftans to punched - metal lanterns to the pointy - toed slippers known as babouches			1
you do n't need a guide , but you do need a serene place to escape to after a frenetic round of shopping			0
choose one of the riads -- lovely old houses built around courtyards -- within the medina , or old city , just a five - minute stroll from the souks			1
@entity241 offers good insider info and has a great hammam for soothing sore feet with steam and massage			0
on the next leg , drive to @entity218 , a dazzling little blue and white town on @entity219 's west coast with a medina of its own that 's light , bright and laid - back , a complete contrast to crowded @entity217			1
@entity218 's original guesthouse , the @entity254 , offers traditional decor , bags of atmosphere , a popular restaurant and the odd celebrity sighting			1
@entity260 and @entity261 , @entity262 from high design to vintage fashion , resin jewelry to aboriginal art , @entity260 is @entity262 's shopping mecca , thanks to a diverse and creative population			1
it 's more about the neighborhoods than downtown ; check out tony @entity273 ( @entity274 ) , edgy @entity276 ( @entity275 and @entity277 ) and eclectic @entity278 ( @entity279 and the fabulous @entity280 )			0
you can stay among some of the best boutiques at the @entity284 on @entity274			0
within a 90 - minute drive is @entity261 , whose mineral springs make it @entity260 's spa bolthole of choice			1
the village of @entity261 itself is charming , and if you ca n't linger overnight , there are day spas , including the historic @entity293 in nearby @entity294			0
but it would be a shame to miss a stay at charming properties like the @entity299 , which boasts an award - winning restaurant as well as a state - of - the - art spa			0
what are your favorite shopping destinations ? what do you recommend purchasing there ?			0

work at shopping in a big city , then *unwind* with a quiet retreat nearby
check out homegrown design in @entity88 before a few days on the coast in @entity89
*navigate* the souks of @entity217 , then drive to laid - back @entity218
