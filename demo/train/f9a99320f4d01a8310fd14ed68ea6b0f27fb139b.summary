-- hostilities were resumed in the oldest international rivalry in football wednesday and although billed as a friendly @entity4 and @entity5 served up a fiercely competitive encounter at @entity7 settled by a dream winner from debutant @entity9			1
the 31 - year - old @entity11 striker was summoned off the bench by @entity4 manager @entity13 just after the hour mark and within moments had put them 3 - 2 ahead with a thumping header from a corner			1
@entity9 replaced @entity20 's @entity19 , who has been the subject of continued speculation about his future with @entity24 keen for his signature			2
@entity19 looked short of match practice and had few opportunities to add to his international tally of 36 goals but a near capacity crowd had plenty of action and atmosphere to soak up			0
the two sides first played in 1872 with @entity5 always keen to beat the " @entity36 " and in particular at @entity37			1
annual matches between the two ended in 1989 but to mark the 150th anniversary of the @entity41 , the fixture was revived as a one - off , the first clash between the teams for 14 years			2
the thousands of fanatical @entity46 fans , who drowned out the home support at times , were celebrating first when @entity49 put them ahead with a dipping shot which deceived @entity4 goalkeeper @entity51			2
@entity52 soon equalized after racing on to @entity53 's through ball , but @entity5 went ahead just after halftime when veteran striker @entity56 found space to turn and shoot home			0
again the lead was short lived and @entity20 's @entity60 headed @entity4 level again			0
the script was written for @entity9 , who had spent much of his early career in the lower leagues , to come on and score a fairytale winner , rising to connect with a pinpoint delivery from @entity67			1
@entity9 might have added to his tally as a later effort thumped the post , but it sent the @entity4 fans home happy ahead of crucial @entity74 qualification matches next month			1
" i 've been dreaming of that all my life			0
it means so much , " @entity9 told @entity77			0

@entity82 put them ahead for the final time until @entity85 salvaged a draw for @entity80 with a 75th minute equalizer			0
@entity88 did not miss @entity89 as they edged @entity91 2 - 1 in @entity92			1
@entity93 and @entity94 put them in control with second half goals			0
@entity98 pulled one back late on for the home side			0

a @entity109 hat - trick helped the @entity110 to a 4 - 3 win in @entity112 , while @entity113 emulated him as @entity114 thumped @entity115 4 - 2			1
in competitive action , @entity117 's hopes of @entity74 qualification were dented by a 1 - 0 loss to minnows @entity121 in @entity122			0
@entity123 scored the only goal to sink the @entity126 's men , who remain two points behind @entity128 but with a game in hand			0
