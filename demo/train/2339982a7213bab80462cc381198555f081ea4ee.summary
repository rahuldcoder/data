editor 's note : @entity2 , whose new book is " @entity4 , " was one of the two @entity6 astronauts who were the first people to set foot on the moon			1
@entity2 walks on the moon in a photo taken by @entity11 , his colleague on the 1969 mission			1
( @entity13 ) -- four decades have passed since the summer of 1969 , when @entity11 , @entity15 and i flew @entity6 's first lunar landing mission			1
the passage of time has not faded either the memory of that summer or the importance of what we achieved , for our mission was about more than just exploring the moon			1
on july 20 , 1969 , @entity11 and i were peering out the window of our lunar lander , the @entity29 , as it descended toward the lunar surface			0
the ship 's computer was steering us toward a field of boulders the size of cars			0
that same computer -- with less power than today 's pocket calculators -- was signaling that it was overworked and dangerously overloaded			0
our single tank of fuel was nearly empty as we approached the surface , invisible to us , cloaked in a cloud of swirling dust			0
@entity11 took manual control and flew us toward a smoother terrain			0
then , as the shadow of our landing gear appeared etched onto the surface in the gloom , a light on our console flashed that contact had been made			0
" @entity55 , @entity56 , " @entity11 radioed to the listening world back home			1
" @entity29 has landed ! " for more than two hours , we explored the moon 's dusty surface			1
we could easily tell that the planet we had landed on was very different from our home			0
the horizon visibly curved away in the distance , a sign of the moon 's much smaller landscape			1
when my boot struck moon dust , the soils flew away in a straight line , a sign of the lighter gravity load , one - sixth that of @entity73			1
when i looked around the stark landscape , it was a magnificent desolation			0
an uninviting world greeted us in eerie silence , hostile to our presence and to all visitors from @entity73			1
the following day , we rocketed up off the surface , rejoined @entity15 orbiting alone in our command ship , the @entity82 , and headed home to a hero 's welcome			0
that welcome took us all around the world in parades , banquets and greetings from millions			1
i was astonished that so many had followed every facet of our flight from start to finish , almost as if they were part of the adventure			1
that spirit , of a world come together in celebration of a peaceful scientific achievement , was perhaps our greatest legacy			2
more than just exploring a hostile new world , @entity103 was about bold vision and great risk , about the obstacles a great nation could overcome with dedication , courage and teamwork			2
it was about choosing a goal that exceeded our grasp -- and then reaching across history to make it happen			0
for me , the most difficult part of the mission was n't what happened during the flight but what happened after we came home			2
without a new mission to train for , i felt lost and without a purpose			2
my personal life was marked by deep depression and bouts of drinking			0
nothing i did seemed to have meaning or motivation for me			0
i left the @entity132 , the space program , and was adrift			2
but then , as i began to recover my bearings , something wonderful happened			0
i met a woman , @entity137 , who helped me to climb out of my depression and see a role for me in space -- but this time while on @entity73			2
i came to dedicate my life to opening space to the average person and crafting designs for new spaceships that could take us far from home			1
but since @entity149 ended , such travels were only in our collective memory			0
for these past decades , our country has achieved great things in space			2
it has built a reusable spacecraft and flown it more than 100 times			0
it has orbited great observatories that have unlocked the secrets of the universe			0
most impressively , it has helped construct an orbiting laboratory that offers the prospect of long - term research into the effects of space flight , research that can not just improve the health and safety of our astronauts but also of people on @entity73			2
but what @entity6 has n't done is inspire the world -- and itself -- with a bold vision for our future in space			1
we have remained , since our @entity149 days , locked in @entity73 orbit			0
but five years ago , @entity181 was tasked with returning to the moon by 2020 , rerunning the moon race that we won 40 years ago			2
not surprisingly , this new race has failed to ignite the imagination of young @entity6 -- or their leaders			0
what we truly need is not more @entity189 - style competition but a destination in space that offers great rewards for the risks to achieve it			2
i believe that destination must be homesteading @entity196 , the first human colony on another world			1
by refocusing our space program on @entity196 for @entity6 's future , we can restore the sense of wonder and adventure in space exploration that we knew in the summer of 1969			1
we won the moon race ; now it 's time for us to live and work on @entity196 , first on its moons and then on its surface			1
exploring and colonizing @entity196 can bring us new scientific understanding of climate change , of how planet - wide processes can make a warm and wet world into a barren landscape			1
by exploring and understanding @entity196 , we may gain key insights into the past and future of our own world			1
just as @entity196 -- a desert planet -- gives us insights into global climate change on @entity73 , the promise awaits for bringing back to life portions of the @entity224 through the application of @entity226 to its similar chemistry , possibly reawakening its life - bearing potential			1
four decades ago , i was privileged to have been part of a great mission of exploration and discovery			0
but @entity6 's future in space has only just started			0
it is time for us to continue the journey			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : our mission to the moon was shared by the world as an adventure
he says he became depressed after the mission was over
@entity2 says he took on a new mission : to open space to the average person
he says a mission to colonize @entity196 would restore adventure of space travel
