@entity0 , @entity1 -- once a star soccer player , @entity3 loves being out on the field , in the open air			1
but the soccer legend fell on hard times , and became a miner			1
" being on the football field is what i have spent my life doing , " he says			2
" i never wanted to be a miner			2
then i was in a mine for 69 days with little chance of surviving			1
" he was one of 33 miners trapped when his mine collapsed in august			1
@entity3 feared the mine would be his tomb			1
" we did n't have days in the mine , " he says through a translator			1
" it was just one long night			2
a night of complete darkness			2
" alone , in the dark and starving			2
" imagine it , a spoon and a half of tuna every 24 hours , then every 48 hours , at the end it was every 72 hours			2
there was no water left , only the water that was in the machines and we could n't drink it , " he recalls			2
they were running out of everything			0
the men blindly scrounged for cigarette butts from the mine floor			1
the only thing they had in abundance was fear			0
then , 17 days after the collapse , a drill bore through , bringing both excitement and hope			0
all of us agreed to be calm , but it was n't possible			0
that was when we returned from the dead , " he says			0
he had only one wish			0
" all we hoped for was to see our families again			0
i dreamed of them every day			0
i saw all their faces			0
that was what gave me the will to survive , " he says			0
and the family shared his will , toughing it out for weeks in the tent camp near the mine , and raising his spirits over a video conference system			1
lobos feared he would never return to his soccer field , right up until the moment the first rescuer arrived in the mine			1
but it turned out that the miner and the rescuer had already met			1
rescuer @entity81 also played professional football in @entity1 -- against @entity74 , the man he was about to save			1
" he told me ' i played against you , ' " when he arrived			1
" i chatted with him about it , about playing with him and i said , ' make my rescue quick			0
i want to be with my family			0
' " his ascent was quick -- so quick that at one point he panicked , thinking he was falling back into the mine			1
@entity81 's rescue of @entity74 is not the end of their intertwined destinies			0
the men will meet once more on the football field in a face off between the miners and the rescuers			0
president @entity103 set up the match and joked that the winners get to stay a night in @entity106 , the presidential palace , while the losers have to go back to the mine			2
@entity74 expects to be on the winning side			0
his glory days may be behind him , @entity3 says , but never bet against a @entity1 miner .			1

@entity3 once played pro soccer , but fell on hard times
he ended up in the @entity1 mine that collapsed
when his rescuer arrived , it turned out they had met before
