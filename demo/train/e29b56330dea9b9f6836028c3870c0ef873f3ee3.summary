-- @entity2 spend so much time defending president @entity4 , it is easy to forget that even the most beloved presidents make mistakes and missteps			1
his new budget , which proposes a method of calculating inflation that will reduce increases in @entity14 payments , is a doozy			1
@entity17 and @entity18 , co-chairs of the @entity20 , have been raising the alarm for months			0
@entity23 and @entity24 circulated a letter firmly pledging to vote against any social safety net cuts			0
as of this moment , 33 representatives have signed			0
now , @entity4 is also getting pushback from outside @entity29			1
opposition runs the political gamut from the @entity32 to nonpartisan @entity33 to anti-tax activist @entity34			2
a coalition of grass - roots organizations has organized to stop the cuts			0
it includes the @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , my organization @entity44 and more			0
many of these groups supported the president in 2012			2
on tuesday , they presented the signatures of more than 2 million @entity51 opposed to cutting @entity14 , @entity52 or @entity54 benefits			1
some may call this a knee - jerk response from liberals who would oppose any adjustments to @entity60 programs			0
progressives must be willing to reform programs such as @entity14 , precisely because they are so important			1
the question is how ? there are better solutions that the president could champion			2
for example , we could shore up @entity14 for decades by raising the cap on taxable income -- so that it is not just poor and middle - class folks whose entire paychecks are taxed			1
but @entity4 's plan leaves that cap in place -- protecting the wealthiest @entity51			1
instead of asking more from the rich to shore up @entity14 , his proposed budget would take more from the middle class and poor			1
do n't let all the @entity82 jargon fool you			2
some in @entity82 would have us believe that @entity4 's " @entity85 " proposal is a mere tweak that more accurately reflects costs			1
by changing the fine print on cost - of - living adjustments , @entity4 's plan would ensure that benefits rise more slowly than inflation			1
that would have devastating impacts on ordinary people immediately upon passage , hurt more tomorrow and get worse each year			2
under his plan , as food and medicine gets more expensive , your @entity14 check would grow only a tiny bit			1
this approach may help the government 's balance sheet , but it would hurt your pocketbook and your family			2
it is not cost savings ; it is cost - shifting			0
to people who paid into the program for their entire lives , it is a cut -- plain and simple			0
prices are rising even faster than inflation on things such as health care , which the elderly consume at a greater rate			0
the most accurate adjustment for inflation would actually give senior citizens more -- not less , which is what they would get under @entity4 's proposal			1
our leaders should be trying to make life easier for middle - class families , not harder			0
second , we are told that we can not balance the budget without cutting the social safety net			0
but we did n't get into a budgetary hole because we spent too much money helping grandma			0
we have a budget imbalance because of the @entity137 wars and @entity137 tax cuts , combined with the economic downturn			0
yet the @entity4 budget eliminates the recent automatic cuts to the @entity143 budget , even as it cuts @entity14 and increases @entity52 premiums for middle - class seniors			1
it does n't make any sense			2
the administration says these cuts would come about only in the context of a so - called " balanced " compromise			0
but the numbers tell a different story			0
economist @entity154 notes that these cuts would hit the average retiree three times as hard as the recent tax increases hit the top 1 %			0
budgets are a vision for the country expressed in dollars			0
@entity4 's budget is far better than the @entity164 alternative			1
but it is time to start expecting more from the man elected twice to speak for the middle class			0
bad ideas from a great president are still bad ideas			1
everyone who pulled the lever for @entity4 in november should call the @entity172 today , and say simply : mr. president , this is not change we can believe in			1
note : an earlier version of this article incorrectly said that president @entity4 was the first @entity2 president to propose changes to reduce future @entity14 benefits			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			2

@entity184 : @entity4 's budget proposed changes that will hurt @entity14 *recipients*
he says opposition to new formula for calculating inflation increases is strong
@entity184 : do n't reduce benefits , raise cap on @entity14 taxes so wealthy pay more
even a great president can make mistakes , and @entity4 made one here , he says
