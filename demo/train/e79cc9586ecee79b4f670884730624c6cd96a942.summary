-- the fledgling @entity1 suffered a blow when two of the world 's most recognized female athletes snubbed the event			1
@entity7 , the agent of both @entity8 and @entity9 , told @entity0 on thursday that neither would be appearing in the team tournament that is set to make its debut in @entity13 this november			1
@entity8 transcends tennis and has long been a magnet for sponsors -- the @entity17 is perennially listed as the world 's richest female athlete by @entity20 -- while @entity21 's @entity9 is one of the marquee names in @entity13 , having captured a second grand slam title at the @entity24 in january			1
@entity9 was " confirmed " as one of the entrants by the @entity1 in a press release last may			1
" @entity8 and @entity9 will not be participating , " @entity7 said in an email			1
@entity29 , a grand slam doubles winner and the main man behind the project modeled after cricket 's highly successful @entity33 , will now be hoping he can secure the likes of @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38			1
@entity39 , the 17 - time grand slam champion and still the biggest name in the sport , told @entity43 this week he generally backed the idea			2
the player list is expected to be revealed friday			1
" firstly , i want to see whether it takes off or not , " @entity39 told @entity43			0
" i know a lot of people have invested in it or are part of it			0
anywhere where tennis grows is a good thing , so i hope it takes off and becomes very successful			2
" in @entity13 , there is enormous potential ( for tennis to grow ) , in places like @entity21 and @entity59 due to the amount of people that live there and the excitement they have for tennis			1
" the tournament sees five teams -- based in @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and another city yet to be officially revealed -- play each other over a roughly three - week period			0
matches are contested over five sets but will employ no - ad scoring			0
one set is played in each of men 's singles , women 's singles , men 's doubles , mixed doubles and legends doubles			1
optimism was initially high , with @entity84 a founding partner of the league and @entity37 -- now coached by @entity84 -- calling it a " revolutionary idea			0
" however , there have been delays in the player auction and the league was originally supposed to have six teams , not five			0
" i think it will be great for tennis if it can be pulled off , " said @entity7			0
" i just do n't see how it could ever work , but i hope i am wrong , " he added without elaborating			0
a tennis insider who spoke on the condition of anonymity told @entity0 he did n't know if the tv revenue was in place to fund salaries and other costs			2
however , @entity104 , ceo of mp and @entity106 , the firm distributing television rights , said there has been " considerable interest both in @entity13 and outside			2
" " we 've been waiting to see the selection of the franchise squads before finalizing any broadcast deals , " he told @entity0			0
" @entity29 's personal credibility and his contacts within the world of tennis have made people sit up and take notice , and we believe that the ' made for tv ' format is a good model on which to grow audiences for tennis worldwide			2
" @entity29 did n't return an email seeking comment thursday			0
apart from who will show up , another question is : how can players complain about a long tennis year but then commit a chunk of the off - season to a tournament ? pros from the @entity136 and @entity137 also face the prospect of making the long trip to @entity13 -- after completing the @entity13 chunk of the schedule weeks or a month before .			1

@entity8 and @entity9 wo n't be *competing* in the new @entity1 , their agent says
@entity8 is *arguably* the biggest name in women 's tennis and @entity9 is *hugely* *popular* in @entity13
the @entity1 is hoping to be as successful as cricket 's established @entity33
the official player list is expected to be revealed on friday
