@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity4 auction house plans to sell off newly discovered sketches done by @entity6 when he was a struggling student trying desperately to get into art school			1
the 12 charcoal and crayon sketches cover " typical student subjects " and do n't display a great deal of promise , @entity8 said			0
they include two drawings of an elderly woman thought to be @entity6 's mother , as well as studies of objects , landscapes , models , and even a @entity22 senator			1
all are signed and some even have @entity6 's @entity26 address , @entity23 's said			1
the sale also includes the original portfolio in which @entity6 kept the sketches , which is signed and has his address , @entity23 's said			1
" they look quite typical of an aspiring student hoping to get into art school -- tentative and not very certain about his perspective when he 's using pencil and pen , making basic errors by getting the top and the bottom of a candlestick wrong in relation to each other , and so on , " said @entity31 , emeritus dean of arts at @entity33 in @entity1			1
letter by @entity6 to @entity4 sells at auction the sketches lack technical skill but are " not so bad that one ca n't imagine him learning			2
" but there 's not latent genius here , and not much beyond a moderate school grade , " @entity31 said			0
" probably if the artist was at school today you would n't encourage him to keep the subject up			0
" the sketches have been owned by a professional artist who had them for years in his own collection and for his own interest , said @entity63 , the historical documents expert at @entity23 's			0
the artist brought the works to @entity23 's attention			0
@entity23 's plans to auction the sketches april 15 in @entity70 , @entity1 , about 125 miles northwest of @entity0			2
they 're expected to bring between £ 4,000 and £ 6,000 ( about $ 6,100 and $ 9,100 ) each , the auction house said			1
the drawings all date from around 1908 and 1909 , when @entity6 was a " penniless dropout " trying to get accepted into the prestigious @entity75 to train as a professional artist , @entity23 's said			1
the school rejected him twice , so @entity6 hung around the city , trying to make a living producing watercolors to sell to tourists , @entity23 's said			2
the rejection by the academy may have had huge implications for @entity6 later in life , @entity63 said			0
" many believe that it was this rejection that turned his mind and unleashed the monster within him , which was to bring forth so much evil on the world , " he said			0
" ... in a sense , therefore , the academic decision of the art establishment in @entity26 can go down as one of the most monumental decisions in all of history			2
" nevertheless , @entity63 said , " on the evidence of these sketches , you can see why the @entity75 turned him away			0
