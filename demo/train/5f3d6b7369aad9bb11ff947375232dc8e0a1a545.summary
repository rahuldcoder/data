@entity0 -- @entity2 has apologized , which is the right thing to do when you do something wrong			1
yet i ca n't accept his apology , since i still have n't figured out what the champion golfer did that was so wrong			2
let me tee up this story			2
my fellow @entity0 - area resident has been thinking a lot about taxes			2
and he 's done some of his thinking out loud			2
two weeks ago , during a conference call with reporters , the golfer made a passing reference to being concerned about " what 's gone on the last few months politically			2
" last week , another reporter asked @entity2 to elaborate and he said : " there are going to be some drastic changes for me because i happen to be in that zone that has been targeted both federally and by the state , and it does n't work for me right now			1
so i 'm going to have to make some changes			2
" it seems that the @entity30 native is thinking about leaving the @entity31 and heading somewhere more welcoming to high - income earners			2
that 's it : @entity2 hinted that he might move his family to another state			1
and he got hammered for it			2
what does he think this is -- a free country ? the golfer claims that he pays about 60 % of his income in combined local , state , and federal taxes			0
that figure seems impossibly high at first			0
but -- as an article in @entity47 pointed out -- with a new federal tax rate of 39.6 % on income over $ 450,000 , and a top state tax rate in @entity30 of 12.3 % on income above $ 1 million , and a 1 % state surcharge for mental health on income above $ 1 million , and a 3.8 % state surcharge for @entity56 on earnings above $ 250,000 , @entity2 's tax bill adds up in a hurry			1
the article estimates that @entity2 's tax rate is closer to 53 %			1
but the golfer was talking about taxes in the broadest possible sense			0
you should also factor in the @entity72 taxes shouldered by the self - employed , the property taxes he pays to @entity64 for his home in the ritzy enclave of @entity67 , where homes can cost $ 15 million , and any municipal taxes he pays to @entity73			0
in 2012 , @entity2 earned about $ 60 million , most of it from product endorsements			1
let 's say that he earns the same amount in 2013 , and assume that he pays at least 50 % of his income in taxes			0
that would mean @entity2 's tax bill for next year would ring up at about $ 30 million			1
that would leave him about $ 30 million after taxes			0
whatever the exact amount of taxes that @entity2 is paying , it 's hard to feel sorry for someone with those sorts of earnings when the rest of us would love to have those problems			1
the backlash was significant enough for @entity2 -- no doubt at the urging of his fleet of lawyers , accountants , managers , agents and public relations specialists -- to call for a mulligan			1
he issued a mea culpa just one day later			0
" finances and taxes are a personal matter , and i should not have made my opinions on them public , " @entity2 said in a statement			1
" i apologize to those i have upset or insulted , and assure you i intend not to let it happen again			1
" i hate that he apologized			1
i suppose that part of it has to do with my job description			0
as an opinion writer , i upset people all the time			1
i 've been known to offend more people before breakfast than some people do all day			1
but since when did @entity124 have the right to life , liberty , the pursuit of happiness -- and the right to never be offended by something that someone else says ? which brings us to what this story is really about			0
it 's not about taxes that are so high that bank robbers should ask the tax collector for lessons , or politicians who try to pay for runaway spending meant to ingratiate them with constituents by " soaking the rich , " or how the wealthy have no right to complain about paying taxes			1
all this is a sideshow			0
the story of how " @entity2 " wound up in a rhetorical sand trap is all about freedom of expression			1
it 's about freedom of speech			0
it 's about freedom -- period			0
how ironic that this story broke the same week that president @entity160 , in his second inaugural address , talked about how " while freedom is a gift from @entity164 , it must be secured by his people here on @entity167 " and how , as @entity124 , " our interests and our conscience compel us to act on behalf of those who long for freedom " and how we should " answer the call of history and carry into an uncertain future that precious light of freedom			2
" where did @entity2 's freedom go ? the story of the golfer and his taxes is , first and foremost , about being free to have your say even when it -- oh dear ! -- offends someone			1
or , in this case , when it 's politically inconvenient for the tax - and - spend crowd to hear			1
to their ears , this kind of talk is subversive			0
if the " super wealthy " complain about paying taxes , before you know it , the " wealthy " will decide their taxes are too high as well			0
then it 'll spread to the merely " well - to - do			0
" that 's why these outbursts have to be nipped in the bud			0
in the end , this story is less about what @entity2 pays in taxes than the price the entire country is paying for our oversensitivity whenever someone says something controversial			1
it 's about where we have arrived in this country -- where we 've convinced ourselves that we 're entitled to go through life never having to confront an opinion on any subject that is different from the ones we hold			2
a couple of years ago , i heard from a reader who said : " you know , i used to agree with much of what you wrote , and i looked forward to reading your column			0
but lately , we just disagree too much , so i 'm going to stop reading			0
" that 's one way to go			0
we can all follow suit and surround ourselves only with opinions we agree with			0
but let 's not kid ourselves			0
wherever that road leads , it is n't to a better and more enlightened society			0
@entity2 does n't owe us an apology			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity242 .			1

@entity2 apologized for comments *criticizing* tax rates he has to pay
@entity242 : @entity2 is entitled to his views , why apologize ?
he says people need to be more willing to hear *alternate* points of view
