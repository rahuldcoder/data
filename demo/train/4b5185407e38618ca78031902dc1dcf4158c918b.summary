-- ordinarily , being ranked as the worst modern president of the @entity2 would be considered unfortunate			1
for you mr. president , that 's the good news			1
as painful as it is to note , your presidency has not yet hit bottom			1
you 've got a long way to go in your descent			1
everywhere you walk , mr. president , the world unravels			1
@entity2 are whispering that each political missile you fire seems to hit not its target but our own house			1
you have undone the core idea you 've advanced , that a larger public sector can save us			1
you are becoming the one - man @entity19 of an experiment in weakness and incompetent government			1
your @entity24 is a dysfunctional mess			1
some veterans who have lived through war have not survived contact with your @entity29			1
your immigration agents are changing diapers and crying for fresh underwear for detained immigrants awaiting deportation			2
your @entity35 has been accused of targeting political opponents , and your best defense is their ineptitude : they lose their e-mails and files			2
your own signature initiative , the @entity42 , has turned on you			2
you 've repeatedly delayed and altered the law , gluing and taping together , on the fly , the health care of an anxious nation			2
@entity47 : what 's behind @entity50 's nutty lawsuit threat your @entity51 is telling you to read the manual that came with your office : you are not allowed to run a nixonian presidency			1
in three years , you 've suffered numerous humiliating and unanimous reversals of your executive authority			2
you are protected by the thinly manned barricades of an attorney general who refuses to investigate misconduct in your executive offices			2
four out of five @entity2 believe the government you would like to expand is corrupt , a view that is a 7 - point increase from the last year of the @entity67 administration			2
you are fortunate you can not be impeached because of the cost to our exhausted , divided country			2
if you were a car manufactured by @entity71 , not the president who bailed it out , you would be recalled for your defects			1
in foreign affairs , you have undone one of the great accomplishments of the 20th century : you have resuscitated the @entity77			2
a two - bit @entity79 thug named @entity80 has been kicking sand in the face of your country			2
in the absence of @entity2 leadership , the @entity84 has devolved into chaos , and you are reduced to unpalatable choices : either you negotiate with our @entity91 enemies or abandon our allies , if we still have any , to jihadist wildfires that threaten @entity96 's borders and set desert sands aflame			1
@entity50 : why we must sue the president young people who voted for you to earn a better life than their parents are now living with their parents			1
our nation has the lost the hope you promised us			2
we fear our freedom is in decline : a 48 % plurality feel our best days are in the past			0
even the one thing you have been good at , mr. president -- politics -- has abandoned you			1
you have now been reduced to pathetically small political " listening tours			0
" even on such an inconsequential stage , you are tone - deaf , incapable of striking the right chords : you tell your audiences you are there to tell them that you are listening			0
you have always been more popular than your policies			0
despite your stumbling , we have loved your bright smile and intellectual aura			0
but now , we are beginning to notice ; you laugh too hard at your own jokes			0
behind the smile , we see an ego inflated beyond merit			0
your intellectual detachment , we now find , was merely cluelessness			0
the distance between what you 've promised and done has grown too large for us to blame anyone else			0
@entity133 : @entity50 , do your job instead is this as bad as it can get ? actually , no , mr. president			1
the road ahead is worse for you			0
even your supporters will soon say publicly what we are all thinking privately			0
in days to come , it will become increasingly cool to snicker and then laugh at your presidency			0
disagreement is not the cruelest cut in politics ; it is ridicule			0
politicians who have survived everything else are done in ultimately by laughter			0
the gristliest moment for an incumbent is not when voters express their anger			0
there is respect , even in those dark days			0
what an incumbent never wants to hear from a voter is pity			0
your worst day will be when a voter says , " poor president @entity161			1
he 's done the best he can			1
" when that day comes , mr. president , your favorable rating will crash another 10 points into the basement			1
@entity167 candidates will not only ignore you , as they now do , they will turn on you			0
that will start a war within your party as candidates like @entity173 and @entity174 rush to defend you			0
if they depose the @entity177 , mere anarchy will be loosed upon the @entity167 world			1
at this moment , our emperor is naked , but no one has yet said it publicly			0
when it is too sad to cry about our presidents , @entity2 laughs			0
that 's what will really hurt			1
join us on @entity189 / @entity188 .			0
