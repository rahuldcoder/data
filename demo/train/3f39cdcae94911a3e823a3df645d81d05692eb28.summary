-- the strong performance of @entity3 parties in the @entity5 elections this week raised eyebrows in some @entity8 capitals			1
on the one hand , analysts say , the @entity9 is inclined to support popular @entity13 movements that have toppled dictators and brought nascent democracy to the region			2
on the other hand , they worry about the ascension of radical @entity3 movements in a region of critical interest to the @entity22 and its allies			1
secretary of state @entity24 reflected that tension this week when she urged @entity3 parties in @entity5 to " embrace democratic norms and rules " by creating a government that respects the full range of human rights			1
" transitions require fair and inclusive elections , but they also demand that those who are elected embrace democratic norms and rules , " @entity32 said tuesday in a speech to the @entity34 , meeting in @entity35			1
the @entity40 , an @entity3 party widely seen as being relatively moderate , won more than 40 % of the vote , according to initial election results			1
the more hardline @entity40 took as much as 25 %			0
run - off votes were held at the start of this week and more ballots are to come , as @entity5 's complicated election process continues			1
" we ... expect all democratic actors and elected officials to uphold universal human rights , including women 's rights , to allow free religious practice , to promote tolerance and good relations among communities of different faiths , and to support peaceful relations with their neighbors , " @entity32 said			1
analysts say the strong showing of @entity3 parties in the first parliamentary elections since the ouster of former president @entity64 , a long - time @entity22 ally , could inflame regional tensions and complicate key relationships			1
" i do n't think any @entity8 government is happy about the result of the elections , " said @entity67 , a @entity68 analyst at the @entity69			1
while the @entity40 has pledged to respect minority rights and work with liberal parties , much of the concern has focused on the success of @entity40 , a @entity77 party that supports broader application of strict @entity80 law in @entity5			1
how the @entity22 deals with the often unpredictable results of democracy will be key			2
" the old formula is not going to work and if we want to be in a position to influence , it will depend on our credibility and the strength of our support for the processes of change , " said @entity83 , senior adviser for @entity84 for the @entity85 , an independent conflict management think tank created and funded by the @entity88			0
in may , president @entity98 suggested a new formula , saying that the @entity13 movements were an opportunity " to show that @entity22 values the dignity of the street vendor in @entity104 more than the raw power of the dictator			2
" he followed up last month , when protests flared again in @entity109 's @entity108 over concerns that the @entity5 military was trying to cling to power			1
at the time , he called for the move to a civilian government " that responds to the legitimate aspirations of the @entity5 people , as soon as possible			2
" but the ability of the @entity22 to influence that change came into focus again tuesday , when the ruling @entity120 granted most presidential powers to prime minister @entity122			2
he took office wednesday and swore in his cabinet , which will serve until presidential elections are held next june			0
despite @entity98 's statements of support for a civilian government , @entity127 -- a member of the @entity128 -- reiterated previous statements contending that @entity122 is a figurehead for the @entity120 installed to " serve the need of the @entity22 in the region over its people 's demands			1
" " he was chosen by the @entity120 with no political base from @entity108 , " @entity127 said			0
" when we demanded a national salvation government , we wanted a representative from the revolutionaries , not a puppet that serves the goals of the military who do not have the right to choose him anyway			0
" criticisms such as @entity156 's show how little influence the @entity22 has over what 's happening in @entity5 , and how little it has to gain even if it supports democratic movements there , @entity67 said			1
" the most they can do is put some pressure on the liberal parties to make sure they really keep on talking to the @entity40 , " she said			0
should the @entity22 pull back from its support for democratization in the region , it will lose all credibility among the @entity5 people , @entity67 said			1
but even if the @entity22 and other countries do continue to support democratic movements in the @entity68 , public opinion in the region has barely shifted , @entity83 said			1
" the @entity13 dividend has proven elusive for the @entity98 administration , " he said			0
the best course , analysts say , is for the @entity22 to continue to support democratic movements while setting out expectations , much like @entity32 did tuesday in @entity35			1
if they do , the problem may sort itself out , @entity0 's @entity176 said in an opinion piece on @entity0			0
" for decades , political @entity80 was the language through which people resisted dictatorial regimes			2
that gave these parties a special status , a kind of halo effect , which has helped them once the dictators fell , " he said			0
but the only way these parties can retain their popularity once in power is to govern effectively , he said			0
" and to be competent at governing and to stay in power , these groups have to moderate themselves , " he wrote			0
" the history of countries from @entity199 to @entity200 suggests that over time , the more radical political elements lose their popular appeal because their mystical attraction was tied up in their opposition to the dictatorships			0
once the dictatorships go , their appeal dwindles			0
" but it wo n't be a quick process , @entity83 said			2
the region is in for years of tumult during which the new @entity13 democracies sort out the differences between conservative and liberal visions of @entity80 democracies			2
and in many respects , the @entity9 will be left on the sidelines , watching and waiting , he said			0
" across a broad spectrum of issues , we face a long period of uncertainty , " he said			0
" we 're kind of stuck in a way			0

@entity5 's complicated electoral process continues , with more votes to come
@entity5 @entity80 should embrace " democratic norms , " secretary @entity32 says
@entity8 *leaders* are n't happy about @entity3 success , analyst says
but the @entity22 and other countries should stand behind democratization , analysts say
