since @entity27 , his wife , summer , and their two young children , @entity25 , and @entity26 , vanished more than three years ago , the @entity20 has been leading the search			1
" due to the fact that the family is believed to be out of the country , and because minor children are involved , the primary investigative responsibility for the case is being transferred to the @entity19 , " lt. @entity29 of the @entity31 's department said in a prepared statement tuesday			1
three years later , no sign of missing family " the @entity19 is the most appropriate law enforcement agency to continue the investigation since they have significant experience and investigative assets in foreign countries			1

@entity27 's mother welcomed the @entity19 's involvement			1
" i 'm very happy for this , " @entity75 said to @entity0 tuesday evening			0
" i 'm happy to get more of the international part of that			0
now , it can reach across to all other countries			0

previously she had expressed doubt that the people in the video were her son and his family , noting that his asthma medicine was left in the car and there were no car seats for the children			1

these are answers that i need			0
and these children , i just wonder what they look like			0
once they find them are they going to remember us ? " " i hope they solve it , so everybody can get some closure , " said @entity27 's brother , @entity109			2
