@entity0 is a talented @entity1 artist who appears to work effortlessly in mediums such as painting and sculpture			1
but for years , he has had an even more ambitious project in mind , one that seems like a fantasy from a @entity10 novel			0
" the idea would be to follow in the footsteps of the first explorers to @entity1 and photograph the northern and southern coasts to create one panoramic image , " he said			1
" it would be one horizon , so you ca n't tell if it 's an island or a continent			2
it 's a search to capture @entity1 's geography in 2012			2
" @entity0 never attempted his journey though , and not just because of the immense logistical challenges and government restrictions			0
his biggest obstacle was there was zero funding available for the trip			0
while artists abound in @entity1 , they , like everyone else , face constant shortages in materials and a @entity36 economic embargo that complicates the sale of their work			1
but now , two years after scrapping his plans to travel and photograph the island , @entity0 has the $ 1,300 he needs for his journey			0
the funds came from an unexpected source , a website called @entity45			1
named for a tree native to @entity1 , @entity46 is the first crowd - funding website aimed at helping artists finance projects in @entity1			1
" everyone 's talking about @entity46 , " @entity0 said			2
" that 's the fun part , how it 's getting buzz among young artists who have ideas for projects but do n't have the funds to do them			1
" on @entity45 , artists approved by the website 's creators upload a sample of their work -- a challenge itself given the island 's scarce and mostly dial - up internet			1
@entity45 then publishes their work along with their biography , a description of their next project and a request for contributions			2
the artists typically wait about 30 days as donations trickle in			0
as with many crowd - funding sites , only projects that are fully financed receive @entity45 's backing			1
the website keeps 5 % of the funds to cover operating costs			0
so far , @entity46 has financed five projects and has another 10 in various stages of fundraising			2
the projects range from a documentary on an iconic @entity1 song to a stop - motion short film of a man being chased by scissors and a straight razor			2
site creators say the artists they feature express themselves freely and represent the incredible variety of @entity1 's independent art scene			1
" the way people use @entity45 so far has exceeded my expectations , " said @entity96 , one of the site 's co-creators along with fellow @entity1 @entity99			1
" i see people who understand how to use it perfectly and how to compete for funding , present a project to attract backers and very quickly learn			0
" @entity96 and @entity99 live in @entity108 but are drawn to the notion that the @entity110 can improve the lives of @entity1 back home			2
an earlier site they collaborated on , @entity115 , is the closest thing @entity1 has to @entity117			0
even though the site is blocked by the government , @entity1 still find ways to access @entity121 so they can sell cars , houses and just about everything else			0
@entity96 said he is concerned that @entity46 might also run afoul with authorities			0
" in @entity1 , everything in a way is mediated by the government , the cultural establishment , " he said			0
" we are more than happy to talk with the government if they show an interest in who we are , how the site works			0
" @entity46 , he said , is a rare example of what many @entity1 on both sides of the @entity138 straits say they seek to accomplish : reconciliation			1
" what i am hoping is to foster creativity in @entity1 to create a bridge between @entity1 like me in the diaspora and @entity1 on the island , " @entity96 said			1
" it costs us nothing to shell out $ 20 - $ 30 , and it goes a long way in @entity1			0
" from his small art studio in the apartment he shares with his relatives , @entity0 is already at work trying to stretch the funds he received from @entity46			1
he is excited " to see the whole country , travel all of @entity1 -- not just know it from outside , but meet the fishermen , the farmers who live there , the out - of - the - way places ... all the places in @entity1 that you do n't even imagine			2
" @entity0 is hoping to begin traveling the island this summer , when the ocean is calmer			0
until then , he researches the software and cameras he could use to create a sprawling panorama of the island			0
and when he finally completes the odyssey , @entity0 will upload his finished work to @entity46 , in the hopes of attracting more financing for @entity1 's independent artists .			1

because of the @entity36 embargo , many young artists in @entity1 are n't able to finance their work
but a website called @entity45 is making it easy for people to donate to @entity1 art projects
@entity46 's co-creator hopes it will " create a bridge " between @entity1 *inside* , outside @entity1
