-- at a press conference in @entity3 earlier this month , i listened as a hospital administrator made the now infamous revelation that a feverish man was allowed to go home from the emergency room even though he 'd recently been in @entity9			1
that man , of course , turned out to be @entity12 , who died the next week of @entity13			1
reporters looked at each other and gasped in surprise			2

i thought , " it 's happened again			0

*communication* errors in hospitals can be *deadly*
