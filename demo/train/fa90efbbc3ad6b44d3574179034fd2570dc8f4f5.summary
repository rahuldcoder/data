@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 may not look any different from its predecessor , but it is @entity8 's only model with a sort of robot living inside			1
@entity8 's new phone , which was announced on tuesday to be sold in stores on october 14 , will have a new function called @entity14			1
the program lets people bark commands or ask questions to the phone , and it will provide an answer or ask follow - up questions in order to perform a given task			2
at the news conference , @entity24 , @entity8 's marketing executive , called @entity14 " the coolest feature of the new @entity3 , " and the company is expected to advertise @entity14 heavily in its sales pitches			1
@entity8 dedicated a significant chunk of the presentation to showing the extent of @entity14 's ability to interpret requests and respond			1
" do i need a raincoat today ? " incites a robo - female voice to reply : " it sure looks like rain today , " as @entity35 , @entity8 's mobile software executive , demonstrated			1
ask @entity14 to remind you to buy flowers for your wife at a certain time , and @entity14 may ask you to identify her in the phone 's address book			2
@entity14 then remembers who she is for future requests , @entity35 said			2
the software integrates with @entity48 and @entity49 for relevant queries			0
it can also schedule appointments in the phone 's calendar and transcribe e-mails or text messages			0
with @entity60 's @entity59 phones , users can dictate messages , too , which are then transcribed by @entity60 's servers			0
other cell phones support voice commands , which is handy when operating a phone while driving , but few people take advantage of the option			0
even the preceding iphones had a basic version of this called @entity71 , which can be activated in the same way as @entity14 , by holding down the phone 's home button			1
but @entity8 's ambitions for @entity14 are much greater			1
@entity76 has said that @entity14 's focus is on artificial intelligence			2
" we like what they do a lot , " the @entity8 co-founder and former ceo said at the @entity82 conference last year			2
@entity35 echoed that onstage tuesday , saying : " i 've been in the @entity88 field a long time , and this still blows me away			0
" the big unveiling of the @entity3 on tuesday was the first time most people learned about @entity14 , but the voice - assistant software is rooted in many years of extensive technical research			1
the project was born at @entity96 , a nonprofit research organization			0
it was a part of an ambitious project called @entity99 , for @entity99			0
the program was funded by the @entity101 ( @entity102 ) , the government division responsible for @entity103 ( gps ) and developments that led to the creation of the @entity106			2
work on @entity14 began in the summer of 2007 , and @entity96 executives decided to spin out the project as a standalone business in 2008			0
@entity8 acquired the company in april 2010			1
" the team was so happy when @entity8 did the acquisition , " @entity111 , a @entity14 co-founder who remained at @entity96 , said in an interview on monday			1
" they have a vision			0
" before joining @entity8 , @entity14 provided a free app for @entity119 mobile devices			1
@entity8 removed it from the @entity121 on tuesday , which means only @entity3 owners will be able to access the service starting next week			1
the version integrated into the @entity3 is vastly superior to the now - defunct app based on onstage demos			1
@entity8 spokespeople did not respond to @entity2 's requests to try the product at the event on tuesday			2
@entity14 's engineers were excited for the opportunity to bake their software deeply into the new @entity3 and build features that a third - party developer would not be able to do because of @entity8 - imposed restrictions , @entity111 said			1
" we are going to be very proud , " he said			0
" the world of virtual personal assistants is going to be everywhere			0
" @entity14 's specialty is in its ability to interpret so - called natural - language requests			1
it was originally developed to handle typed queries , @entity111 said			0
for the voice transcription , @entity14 uses technology from @entity148 , @entity149 , an exec for @entity148 's mobile division , said in an interview on tuesday			1
@entity8 also licenses @entity148 's voice transcription for features on the @entity155 like @entity14 , @entity148 was spun out from @entity96			1
" we 're thrilled with today 's announcement , " @entity149 said			0
" what you 're seeing today is the beginning of the next generation [ of mobile assistants ]			0
that 's really the deep integration and the totality of the experience			0
" for technologists , like @entity8 co-founder @entity169 , the ability to speak into a digital companion that can understand and respond is a sci - fi dream realized			2
" i do n't like to learn programs ' methods of doing everything , " @entity169 said in a recent interview with @entity2			0
" i just want to speak it and have it happen			0
" @entity8 is betting that @entity14 's implementation of that will be a major selling point for the new phone			1
despite no apparent technical limitations , the software will only be offered on the @entity3 at first			0
" @entity14 is compelling , " @entity185 ceo @entity184 said in an interview after the announcement			0
he indicated that he expected the feature would be a significant enough reason to spur current @entity3 users to purchase the @entity3 .			2

@entity8 's @entity3 will have a new voice - assistant feature called @entity14
@entity14 is based on a government - funded research program
@entity8 acquired @entity14 in april 2010
