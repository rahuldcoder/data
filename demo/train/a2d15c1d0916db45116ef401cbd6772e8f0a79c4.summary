@entity0 , @entity1 -- a human rights group on saturday urged @entity1 authorities not to put acid in the eyes of a man found guilty of blinding a woman who scorned him			1
@entity10 is scheduled to be blinded by having five drops of acid in each eye saturday , according to @entity13			1
it was unclear what time -- or whether -- the punishment will take place saturday			2
the semiofficial @entity18 , or @entity18 , reported saturday that the acid punishment had been postponed and another date had n't been established			1
@entity10 was convicted in 2008 of throwing a bucket of acid on @entity23			1
the attack blinded @entity23 , who sought to have authorities render the ancient punishment of " @entity27 " in accordance with @entity30 law			1
the rights group is urging @entity1 to forgo the acid punishment			1
" it is unbelievable that the @entity1 authorities would consider implementing such a punishment , " said @entity33 , an @entity13 deputy director			2
" regardless of how horrific the crime suffered by @entity23 , being blinded with acid is a cruel and inhuman punishment amounting to torture , and the @entity1 authorities have a responsibility under international law to ensure it does not go ahead			1
" @entity23 said it has been very difficult for her since the attack			2
she says she first met @entity10 in 2002 when they attended the same school			1
she was a 24 - year - old electronics student			0
she never noticed him until he sat next to her in class and brushed up against her			0
@entity23 says she knew it was n't an accident			0
" i moved away from him , " she said , " but he brushed up against me again			0
" @entity23 said that over the next two years , @entity10 harassed her and made threats , even asking her to marry him			1
" he told me he would kill me			0
he said , ' you have to say yes			0
' " on a november afternoon in 2004 , his threats turned to violence when he followed her from the medical engineering company where she worked			0
as she walked to the bus stop , she sensed someone behind her			0
she turned around and was startled to see @entity10 , who threw something over her			1
what felt like fire on her face was acid searing through her skin			2
" i was just yelling , ' i 'm burning ! i 'm burning ! for @entity72 's sake , somebody help me , ' " she said			0
the acid seeped into her eyes , and streamed down her face into her mouth			1
when she covered her face with her hands , streaks of acid ran down her fingers and onto her forearms			2
in 2009 , @entity23 told @entity2 that she had undergone more than a dozen surgeries on her badly scarred face , but still imagined that in the future she would have a wedding day			0
" i always see myself as someone who can see and sometimes see myself in a beautiful wedding gown , and why not ? " she said			0
