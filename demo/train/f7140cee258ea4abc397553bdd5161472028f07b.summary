-- @entity1 , who won big at the @entity2 , once told @entity3 off when he said that she was talented and pretty but a little too fat			1
maybe his words got to her			0
the @entity6 pop star made news this week when she admitted to wearing four pairs of @entity9 under a dress that wowed the audiences at the @entity2			1
apparently , this was an improvement over her original dress that featured a built - in corset and in which she passed out when she tried it on			2
@entity9 is a line of undergarments that offers solutions for women of all sizes and shapes			1
you can target bulging stomachs , jiggling upper arms , aging breasts and any other body part that may need some enhancement			0
no longer an item of fantasy play or a secret amongst plus - sized women , @entity9 products have become prized accessories flaunted by the @entity35 , @entity36 and suburban moms			1
@entity9 's selling point is that it helps smart , successful women of all ages to build their confidence by , well , looking good			1
but playing with fire might be a more adequate metaphor when we consider that less than half a century ago , women denounced @entity9 - like garments as symbols of oppressive beauty standards			1
when women got rid of girdles and garter belts en masse in the 1960s , they did n't only reject restricting undergarments			2
( and restrict they did ; it 's hard to ride a bike , perform surgery or even breathe , as @entity1 learned , when your midsection is squeezed tight )			1
they also rejected a society in which women were underemployed , underpaid and underappreciated			2
throwing away girdles and curlers seemed like the dawn of a new era			0
women got jobs , demanded equal pay and learned to be as tough as their male peers			2
fifty years later , the girdle - like @entity9 is back thanks to @entity74 , a brilliant woman who built a multimillion empire			1
@entity74 used $ 5,000 to start a brand that defines its category , shapewear			2
she owns 100 % of a company that turns a handsome profit			0
she is the youngest female self - made billionaire in the world			2
she would be a darling of the women 's movement if her innovation was n't antithetical to everything else it stood for			2
the twist is that @entity9 prides itself on empowering women			1
the tagline for its @entity93 panties that promise to whittle your waist , firm your figure and amp up your look is " powerful women wear powerful panties			2
" the company 's catalog proclaims : " tame your tummy and create an hourglass silhouette with @entity104 , our new comfortable yet powerful high - waisted hosiery shaper ...			0
now , you 've got the power ! " translation : powerful women tame unsightly bulges			0
say bye - bye to bad body image talk it was n't supposed to be this way			0
the protesters who descended upon @entity115 in 1968 to picket the @entity117 pageant were n't clamoring for more comfortable girdles			0
they wanted to change the rules of the game , telling women that their power lay in their heads , not in their bras and panties			0
what the 1968 protesters fought for still matters today			0
despite huge progress , our society is not a post-feminist era			0
women earn less than 80 cents to a man 's dollar , hold about 17 % of the seats in @entity136 and represent 3.6 % of @entity137			0
of course , women are n't marched to their lingerie drawers at gunpoint			0
they choose to spend $ 250 million a year on @entity9 products alone			1
some would argue they make a wise choice			0
while beauty standards have changed , women are still rewarded for boosting their appearance			1
better - looking women are more likely to be hired and promoted than those who are less attractive			1
but when women think that they can have both their @entity9 and their paychecks , they miss the big picture			1
the culture that gave us @entity9 holds us to impossible standards of beauty that even the sveltest women can not meet ( just think of all the @entity157 stars who are always trying to slim down )			1
and it provides us with an impoverished sense of empowerment			1
sadly , even women running for the highest office are not immune			0
like the beautiful actresses who go the extra mile to put on their best appearance on the red carpet , politicians are as attuned to perceptions			0
@entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 all upped their wardrobe ante when they stepped into the national spotlight			0
ending up on @entity175 's worst - dressed list could be as embarrassing for a politician as for a starlet			0
of course , we ca n't blame @entity9 or @entity74 for any of this			1
all of us are to blame			0
with our dollars , we support the very object that constrains us			1
when we wear shapewear , we buy into messages that equate women 's power and abilities to the size and shape of their silhouettes			1
little wonder that a woman of @entity1 's caliber felt the pressure , too			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			2

@entity6 pop star @entity1 wore four pairs of @entity9 at the @entity2
@entity195 : girdle - like garments were symbols of oppressive beauty standards
she says embracing shapewear gives women an impoverished sense of empowerment
@entity195 : we can blame ourselves for supporting the very object that constrains us
