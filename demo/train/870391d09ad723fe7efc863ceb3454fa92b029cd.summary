@entity0 , @entity1 -- a federal hearing began monday to determine whether @entity0 should be charged with a willful violation in the 2010 death of killer whale trainer @entity6			1
as witnesses took the stand inside the @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity1 , members of @entity8 , or @entity8 , demonstrated outside			0
monday was the first day of the hearing , which will resume at 9 a.m. tuesday and is expected to continue all week			0
in february 2010 , as park guests watched in horror , @entity6 , 40 , was pulled into a @entity17 pool and drowned by a 12,000 - pound killer whale named @entity19			1
@entity6 had been sitting on the @entity21 's pool edge during a private show			1
after a lengthy investigation , the @entity23 -- the federal agency that works to prevent workplace injuries -- cited @entity17 of @entity1 in august 2010 for willfully endangering employees by not taking proper safety precautions			1
" @entity17 recognized the inherent risk of allowing trainers to interact with potentially dangerous animals , " @entity28 , @entity23 's @entity29 regional administrator , said in a statement			1
" nonetheless , it required its employees to work within the pool wall , on ledges and on shelves where they were subject to dangerous behavior by the animals , " she said			0
the citation said the park allowed its employees to work with @entity19 , a whale with " known aggressive tendencies " who was involved in the 1991 death of a trainer at a @entity49 , @entity50 , marine park			2
the theme park did not provide barriers , decking , oxygen supply systems or other types of protection for the trainers , @entity23 said			0
@entity17 spokeswoman @entity58 disagreed , saying , " these allegations are completely baseless , unsupported by any evidence or precedent , and reflect a fundamental lack of understanding of the safety requirements associated with marine mammal care			1
" @entity17 contested @entity23 's findings and is presenting evidence to the @entity68 , a separate government agency , at this week 's hearing in @entity12 , northeast of @entity0			1
@entity23 review committee administrative judge @entity70 is presiding over the hearing , in which both sides are presenting evidence and witness testimony			2
in his opening remarks on monday , @entity23 attorney @entity76 said @entity17 allowed their trainers to take a calculated risk by working with killer whales that have the potential to cause harm or death to those who get close			1
trainers are required to sign a document that acknowledges that they have read the standard operating procedure manual and acknowledge the calculated risk			0
@entity76 called the document a release waiver and argued that the park 's training for the handlers was not enough			0
@entity17 's attorney said the handlers ' training is only one component , noting that the animals are trained , too			0
" it goes hand in hand , " said @entity98			0
it 's unclear if @entity23 's attorneys will present surveillance video showing @entity6 's death			1
her relatives have fought to keep it sealed			0
@entity108 district judge @entity107 on thursday denied the @entity6 family 's request to keep the tape from being released or used at the hearing			2
" we can not comment on what may or may not be presented ( during the hearing ) , as that depends not only on our own attorneys but also on any rulings issued by the judge in the case , " @entity23 spokesman @entity113 said			0
since the accident , @entity17 has restricted all trainers from entering the water with killer whales until further notice , though @entity19 has returned in a theme park show called " @entity128			2

after death of killer whale trainer , @entity23 said @entity17 did *n't* take proper precautions
