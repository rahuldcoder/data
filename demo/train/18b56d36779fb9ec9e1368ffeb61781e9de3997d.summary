@entity0 -- @entity3 presidential candidate @entity2 is trying to shift into high gear , but elections experts say his campaign seems to be stuck in second			1
with just weeks before the nominating conventions and his national debut before a broader electorate , @entity2 's struggles to make the case that he is best equipped to pull the nation out of the economic doldrums could derail his quest for the presidency			1
@entity2 's biggest challenge ? turning the conversation back to the weak economy and poor job growth and away from president @entity23 's re-election campaign 's attacks on his tenure at private equity firm @entity25 and refusal to release more tax records			1
@entity2 has stalled at this			2
given the ailing economy , @entity2 should be faring much better , political experts say			2
" one way to measure this is -- given the conditions of the country and the economy -- one would think the challenger would be ahead and he 's not , " said @entity1 senior political analyst @entity31			2
his tax plan , the release of which was intended to offer a punctuation mark on how he 'd handle the economy , was criticized by the @entity44			0
the plan would provide large tax cuts to the very wealthy while increasing the tax burden on the lower and middle classes			0
it would make it tough to recoup lost government revenue , according to the @entity53 study			0
and those campaign attack ads from @entity23 's campaign and those supporting it are n't helping			1
according to a @entity1 / @entity60 poll of likely voters released thursday , @entity2 's unfavorable rating jumped to 48 % from 42 % a month ago , a drop which followed a period in which the @entity23 campaign hammered the @entity3 presidential hopeful with a deluge of advertising and news stories about his time at @entity25 and calls for @entity2 to release more of his tax records , which he has refused to do			1
@entity23 now leads @entity2 by seven percentage points in the poll with 52 % of registered voters questioned in the survey saying that they 'd vote to re-elect the president and 45 % backing @entity2			1
worse , political experts say , is the somber news for @entity2 that only 45 % of those polled by @entity1 said that the economy would get better if @entity2 were elected -- two percentage points below @entity23 's number			1
a recent @entity83 poll has @entity23 garnering 49 % of the vote and @entity2 40 % if the election were held today			2
@entity23 's lead in that poll comes from an 11 % lead among independent voters			1
in a @entity97 / @entity96 / @entity95 swing state poll released recently , more than 50 % of voters in the battleground states of @entity92 and @entity93 said they do not feel @entity2 " cares about the needs and problems of people " like themselves			2
more than 50 % of voters polled in those two states said @entity23 cares about their needs and problems			2
" i think the @entity23 campaign is outmaneuvering the @entity2 campaign			1
they 've kept him on the defensive on his taxes and on @entity25 , which is a key foundation for his campaign , " @entity31 said			0
" this rat - a - tat of advertising , this avalanche of advertising has taken a toll			0
" and in some cases , @entity2 has also been his own worst enemy , said @entity119 , political science professor at @entity120			0
" @entity2 has n't helped himself by not putting these issues to bed with the tax situation and has allowed these issues to linger , " @entity119 said			0
" this could have been a two - day story			0
that 's time we 're spending not talking about what @entity2 wants to talk about , which is the economy			2
he 's put himself in a tough box here			0
" @entity2 will have to pull out all the stops if he wants to change the narrative the @entity23 campaign has crafted , political experts say			1
" he has to capture the agenda back and remind people , ' i 'm the businessman who made a lot of money , and i can help you make lots of money , ' " @entity119 said			0
" if he does n't do that soon these ideas people have about him will harden			0
" every step @entity2 makes â € ” including his running mate â € ” has to be getting back to where @entity23 is weak , and that 's the economy			1
" but there are pitfalls in @entity2 's choice			1
" ( former @entity159 gov. @entity158 ) @entity158 is a classic example , " said @entity156 , author of " the persecution of @entity158 : how the @entity161 tried to bring down a @entity162			0
" " you see a motivating force for conservatives			0
the downside is , is the candidate ready to have the spotlight shined on them ? are they ready for the tough questions such as @entity158 with @entity172 ? are there holes in the biography that can be filled in by myth ? " @entity2 's best bet to help him shore up his conservative bona fides and flagging support is to choose someone who appeals to middle - class white voters without college degrees who understands them , @entity156 said			1
the types of voters who have been hard hit by the economic downturn live in swing states and are the target of the @entity23 campaign 's ads on what it casts as the human costs of @entity2 's financial success			1
it 's a big task			0
the @entity23 campaign has tried to define @entity2 before he 's had a chance to do it for himself			1
as a result , @entity2 's convention speech will be more important than ever , @entity31 said			1
" it 's going to be his first chance to introduce himself to the country in terms of values and lay out his plan for the future ... he 's got to do that to close up this gap , " @entity31 said			0
" it 's now clear that @entity2 ca n't win this election by default			2
it 's not an apple that 's going to fall into his lap because the economy is weak			0
he 's got to take it away from ( @entity23 )			2
" @entity1 's @entity219 , @entity221 's @entity220 and the @entity222 contributed to this report			0

@entity3 presidential hopeful @entity2 's campaign has struggled to gain *traction*
president @entity23 's campaign attack ads have taken a toll
polls show @entity2 lags on what experts say should be his strongest area : the economy
@entity2 will have to choose a strong running mate , give great convention speech
