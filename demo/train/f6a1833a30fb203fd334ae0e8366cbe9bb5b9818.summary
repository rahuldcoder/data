-- for the @entity3 administration , yesterday 's gaffe may be tomorrow 's masterstroke			2
the idea that secretary of state @entity6 said would never work now appears to be the best chance of averting a @entity9 military strike on @entity10 , and the @entity3 administration moved on tuesday to stake its claim on the proposal			1
it started early on monday , when @entity6 broached the idea of @entity10 handing its arsenal of chemical weapons to international control			1
but @entity6 immediately dismissed the idea , saying @entity10 leader @entity20 " is n't about to do it , and it ca n't be done , obviously			1
" shortly after , @entity22 foreign minister @entity21 announced that @entity23 would be willing to support it , and his @entity10 counterpart quickly welcomed the concept			1
with the administration fighting an uphill battle to win support from @entity31 for military action , a @entity9 official told @entity0 on condition of anonymity that @entity6 's remarks were a " major goof			1
" @entity6 spokeswoman @entity37 sought to roll back the comments , saying he was simply responding to a " hypothetical			2
" but by monday evening , president @entity3 called it a welcome development " if true , " warning that it could n't be used as an opportunity for @entity10 to stall for time			1
@entity3 told @entity0 that the threat of @entity9 force " has prompted some interesting conversations , " including one he had with @entity22 president @entity45 at the @entity47 economic summit @entity45 hosted in @entity48			2
" when i was at the @entity47 , we had some time to discuss this , and i believe that mr. @entity45 does not see the use of chemical weapons as a good thing inside of @entity10 or anyplace else , " @entity3 said			1
and by tuesday morning , @entity6 told the @entity56 that the @entity22 plan " is not something that , you know , suddenly emerged , though it did publicly			2
" " president @entity45 raised the issue with president @entity3 at @entity48			0
president @entity3 directed us to try to continue to talk and see if it is possible , " he said			0
the plan appears to have taken on " a life of its own " in the past day and could help @entity68 and @entity23 reach " a mutually face - saving solution , " said @entity70 , director of the @entity22 and @entity71 and the @entity68 - based @entity72			2
" this is really a rabbit out of a hat , " @entity70 said			0
for @entity3 , with @entity9 largely opposed to yet another military action in the @entity81 , " this is the way to at least buy some time and get diplomacy back in the game and in the front seat			2
" and @entity22 -- @entity10 's leading ally -- does n't want " to be viewed as the defenders of the user of chemical weapons , and @entity45 would rather aspire to winning the @entity86 , " @entity70 said			1
a senior @entity3 administration official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said monday 's developments were n't pre-planned , but were an example of diplomacy in real time			1
@entity21 and @entity6 had discussed the idea over the weekend ; the two spoke again after @entity6 's comments on monday in a previously scheduled call , when @entity21 told @entity6 he would make a public proposal based on the @entity9 's remarks			1
but @entity70 said tuesday 's explanation is " almost not at all " believable			0
" i would hope that our two governments had talked about the possibility of cooperation and dealing with the @entity10 chemical weapons arsenal			1
i do n't doubt that that 's come up in conversations , " he said			0
" but to suggest that president @entity3 and @entity45 were talking seriously about this ? they only talked for 20 minutes or so at the @entity47 , and there has to be time for interpretation			0
" @entity70 cautioned that reaching agreement on a @entity116 resolution to close the deal will be difficult , and implementing an agreement " is going to be much more difficult			0
" but he added , " we 'll see how it goes			0
" perhaps more will be known after thursday			0
that 's when @entity6 travels to @entity122 to meet with @entity21 to begin discussions on a possible deal , according to senior @entity126 officials			1
@entity6 will be accompanied by a team of experts at the talks , which are expected to take place in several sessions over two days			0
the officials cautioned that the negotiations may not be concluded in @entity122 and any agreement would be presented to the @entity116 for consideration as a resolution			0
@entity0 's @entity136 and @entity137 contributed to this report .			0

how did @entity6 's so - called " major goof " turn into a possible solution to @entity10 *crisis* ?
@entity10 accepts proposal to hand chemical weapons over to international control
this is diplomacy in real time , says administration official
next step for @entity6 will be trip to @entity122 to meet with @entity22 counterpart
