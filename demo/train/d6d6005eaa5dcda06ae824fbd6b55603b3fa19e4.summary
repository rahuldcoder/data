-- @entity1 does n't like the question -- instead , he points to a picture			1
it is of a hospital in @entity6 -- " i want to give a chance to each child , " he says			2
when @entity1 , a four time @entity9 , signed for @entity11 side @entity10 in august 2011 , he became the highest paid player in the world			1
here was a man who had already won the @entity15 on three occasions , starred for @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 and led @entity6 to @entity21 glory -- twice			2
it was a move which raised plenty of eyebrows considering @entity10 's standing on the @entity27 stage and gave credence to the argument that @entity1 was more interested in @entity11 rubles than ramming home goals in one of the continent 's top divisions			1
such accusations rile the 32 - year - old , who is adamant that he made the move to an unheralded team in @entity40 for the challenge rather than the financial rewards provided by the club 's oil tycoon chairman @entity43			1
money " it 's not a question of money because when you look at my career , i 've won everything except for the @entity53 , " @entity1 told @entity46			1
" it 's also a problem of motivation too			0
i had the opportunity this window to go play again at @entity19 and other teams in @entity60			0
" at @entity19 , i was the best paid player in the world			1
but it 's not a question of money because when i go out onto the pitch , i only have one thing in mind -- winning			2
" and i do n't think about having money in my bank account or not , i only think about winning , having fun and entertaining the fans -- these are the only things i have in my head			2
" of course , it 's normal for people to say , ' yeah , this player changed teams because of the money			2
' " that could be the case sometimes , but after a certain level of success ? no. " that money has given him a life he may never have dreamed of while growing up as a young boy in @entity6 -- but it has also helped hundreds of disadvantaged children in his home country			0
charity the " @entity91 @entity1 , " which was established in 2006 , helps provide basic healthcare and works on improving social inclusion			2
so while @entity1 is aware of the exorbitant wages he has received , he is equally aware of just how vital that money has been in helping those chasing the dream of becoming @entity98 's next superstar football player			1
" we 've done quite a few things with ambulances , operation centers ... we 've built hospitals in the interior of the country. , " he points out			0
" i have a lot of boys who play in @entity18 's youth academy -- i have another named @entity109 who plays also for @entity110 -- all of these come from my foundation			0
" i have a lad who 's a good forward , he 's doing quite well , named @entity114			0
i have a kid named @entity116 who 's a center back			0
" all of them come from my foundation and it 's the joy that i try to share -- the opportunity -- that i want to give to each child			0
" they themselves have to fight for their place , but the first opportunity is what i try to give them			0
" @entity1 , now at @entity129 following his move to @entity131 last month , has reportedly taken a huge pay cut from the estimated $ 26.8 million a year he was earning at @entity10			1
instead , he has signed a one - year deal at @entity134 thought to be worth around $ 11 million with @entity10 keen to offload the forward and ease pressure on its wage bill			1
the move to the west @entity131 club came as something of a surprise , not least because of the striker 's former disdain for a club which he said , " i 'd rather sell groundnuts in my village than to play for a pathetic team like @entity129			1
" that comment came following @entity129 's @entity15 victory over @entity18 in 2005 where @entity1 was left seething at the tactics of a certain @entity150 - now in his second spell as manager of the @entity131 club			1
after the tie , which @entity129 won , @entity1 told a @entity155 media outlet : " @entity129 going through is a disaster for football			1
" if this team wins the @entity15 , it would make you want to retire			2
" @entity150 little did @entity1 know then that five years later he would be exchanging love letters and text messages with @entity150 as @entity19 embarked on an astonishing run of success which culminated with victory in the 2010 @entity15 final			1
in july 2009 , the @entity6 striker was sent packing by @entity18 as the @entity169 club secured the services of the enigmatic @entity171			0
@entity1 , was seen as surplus to requirements and moved to @entity174 to team up with @entity150 -- a partnership which flourished even after the two parted ways			1
while he is reticent when it comes to talking about former @entity18 boss @entity181 , " i do n't talk about him , " he says , @entity1 is unyielding in his praise for @entity150			1
" there is only one @entity150 , ' @entity1 once said about the @entity185 coach			1
" i have played under a lot of great coaches but there is no other character in the game like @entity150			2
" the two men helped @entity19 win the treble during their time together at the @entity194 and @entity1 even revealed that he attempted to persuade @entity150 to move to @entity10 with him			1
" since we met at @entity19 , he has always been in my life , " he said			0
" we talk almost all the time -- he sent me a good luck message before a match and i 'd send him something , he can ask me something or i can do the same			0
" and i 'm going to tell you a secret			0
you know that i spoke with the boss about coming with me to @entity10 ? because i thought he was the right man for the job and situation			2
yes , i said this to him			0
" champions @entity150 , now back at @entity129 following his departure from @entity17 , will hope the two can combine again with the club aiming to challenge for both the @entity217 and @entity15 titles			1
@entity1 sees similarities between this @entity129 side and the @entity19 team which conquered @entity27 in 2010 -- and believes another @entity15 title could be on the horizon			1
" when i got to @entity19 , they did n't expect anything from us , " he said			0
" people would say , ' they 're old , they 're this , they 're that ' and we ended up winning everything			0
" in football , it 's not a question of saying , ' do we have a squad ? ' " the first thing for victory is believing			0
believing that you can achieve			0
when you believe that you can achieve something , i 'm sure that you 're 60 % on the path to victory			0
" @entity129 has won before and it can win again			2
we 're going to work hard to be able to do it			0

@entity1 *insists* he did not move to @entity10 for the money
the 32 - year - old was the highest paid player in the world during his time in @entity11 football
@entity1 signed for @entity129 in august after *reuniting* with manager @entity150
believes new club has every chance of winning the @entity15
