-- if you want to understand the way prescription drugs are marketed today , have a look at the 1928 book , " propaganda , " by @entity7 , the father of public relations in @entity9			2
for @entity7 , the public relations business was less about selling things than about creating the conditions for things to sell themselves			1
when @entity7 was working as a salesman for @entity17 pianos , for example , he did not simply place advertisements for pianos in newspapers			0
that would have been too obvious			0
instead , @entity7 persuaded reporters to write about a new trend : sophisticated people were putting aside a special room in the home for playing music			0
once a person had a music room , @entity7 believed , he would naturally think of buying a piano			0
as @entity7 wrote , " it will come to him as his own idea			0
" just as @entity7 sold pianos by selling the music room , pharmaceutical marketers now sell drugs by selling the diseases that they treat			1
the buzzword is " disease branding			1
" to brand a disease is to shape its public perception in order to make it more palatable to potential patients			1
panic disorder , reflux disease , erectile dysfunction , restless legs syndrome , bipolar disorder , overactive bladder , @entity52 , premenstrual dysphoric disorder , even clinical depression : all these conditions were once regarded as rare until a marketing campaign transformed the brand			1
once a branded disease has achieved a degree of cultural legitimacy , there is no need to convince anyone that a drug to treat it is necessary			1
it will come to him as his own idea			0
disease branding works especially well for two kinds of conditions			1
the first is the shameful condition that can be destigmatized			0
for instance , when @entity74 launched @entity75 in the late 1990s , the condition the drug treated was known to doctors as " urge incontinence			2
" patients called it " accidentally peeing in my pants " and were embarrassed to bring it up with their physicians			0
@entity74 fixed the problem by rebranding the condition as " overactive bladder			0
" whereas " incontinence " suggested weakness and was associated mainly with elderly women , the phrase " overactive bladder " evoked a supercharged organ frantically working overtime			0
to qualify for a diagnosis of " overactive bladder , " patients did not actually have to lose bladder control			0
" they simply needed to go to the bathroom a lot			2
the vice president of @entity74 , @entity103 , explained the branding strategy in a 2002 presentation called " positioning @entity75 : creating a @entity106			1
" by creating the disease of " overactive bladder , " @entity103 claimed , @entity74 created a market of 21 million potential patients			1
another good candidate for branding is a condition that can be plausibly portrayed as under - diagnosed			2
branding such a condition assures potential patients that they are part of a large and credible community of sufferers			2
for example , in 1999 , the @entity119 approved the antidepressant @entity121 for the treatment of " social anxiety disorder , " a condition previously known as " shyness			1
" see more @entity0 opinion articles in order to convince shy people they had social anxiety disorder , @entity127 , the maker of @entity121 , hired a pr firm called @entity133 and @entity134			1
@entity133 and @entity134 put together a public awareness campaign called " imagine being allergic to people , " which was allegedly sponsored by a group called the " @entity138			0
" @entity127 also recruited celebrities like @entity140 , the @entity141 running back , and paid them to give interviews to the press about their own social anxiety disorder			1
finally , they hired academic psychiatrists working on social anxiety disorder and sent them out on the lecture circuit in the top 25 media markets			1
in the two years before @entity121 was approved for social anxiety , there were only about 50 references to social anxiety disorder in the press			1
but in 1999 , during the @entity158 campaign , there were over a billion references			0
within two years @entity121 had become the seventh most profitable drug in @entity9 , and @entity133 and @entity134 had picked up an award for the best pr campaign of 1999			1
today , social anxiety disorder , far from being rare , is often described as the third most common mental illness in the world			1
it is hard to brand a disease without the help of physicians , of course			2
so drug companies typically recruit academic " thought leaders " to write and speak about any new conditions they are trying to introduce			2
it also helps if the physicians believe the branded condition is dangerous			0
when @entity179 introduced @entity180 ( and later @entity181 ) for heartburn , for example , it famously repositioned heartburn as " gastroesophageal reflux disease , " or @entity185			2
but it also commissioned research to demonstrate the devastating consequences of failing to treat it			0
if all drugs were harmless , disease branding would be relatively harmless , too			1
but no drug is completely benign			0
for example , @entity75 can make elderly people delirious and may cause memory problems			0
@entity121 is associated with sexual dysfunction and dependence			2
it also carries a black - box warning for suicide in children and adolescents			0
side effects like these are a part of every drug			1
but they are never part of the brand			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211 .			2

@entity211 : drug makers have mastered the art of branding medical conditions to sell cures
by creating a brand , firms can make *consumers* feel taking a drug is needed
the disease branding tends to overlook the potential side effects of the drug , he says
@entity211 : @entity121 was marketed to treat " social anxiety disorder , " once known as " shyness "
