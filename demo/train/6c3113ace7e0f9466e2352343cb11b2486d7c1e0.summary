-- when you think back to your favorite tv memories , often music is intertwined			1
whether it 's the theme song from " @entity6 , " " @entity7 , " " @entity8 " or " @entity9 , " it 's often the thing people remember more than anything else about a show			1
but were they ever on the same level with , say , the themes from " @entity17 " or " @entity18 ? " over the past decade , we 've seen the rise of television as prestige entertainment			1
and we 've had memorable theme music to go along with it , from " @entity25 " to " @entity26 " to " @entity27			1
" two of the most noteworthy themes from the recent era , " @entity36 " and " @entity37 , " come from the mind of young @entity33 - winning composer @entity32 , who has been in demand ever since " battlestar			1
" for example , he won that @entity39 for the @entity40 " @entity47 , " and most recently , he 's composed the theme for the high - profile network series " @entity46 " and the upcoming @entity40 series " @entity45			1
" @entity32 recently spoke to @entity0 about what goes into tv music in the 21st century , and whether it now stands shoulder to shoulder with movie scoring			1
@entity0 : how did you first find yourself in this line of work ? @entity32 : i 've never wanted to do anything else for as long as i can remember			1
when i was a kid , i loved film and television and loved music			1
i was always keenly aware of music in film and television , more so than anyone else i knew			1
when i 'd go see a movie , my friends would talk about the cool spaceships ( and later , the hot chicks )			1
but for me , i would talk about how @entity68 used the @entity70 horns instead of the @entity72 horns to signify a different character , or what @entity74 or @entity75 was doing			1
these were my heroes growing up , so it never occurred to me to do anything else with my life			1
i 'm very lucky that i got into it , because there 's literally nothing else i would be interested in doing in my life			2
my first project was " @entity36 , " which put me on the map in a big way in science fiction			2
even the horror and suspense genres , action shows -- i do a lot of work in that environment			2
when ( creator ) @entity95 called me about doing " @entity47 , " it was the first time i was asked to do a historical period piece , so i leapt at the opportunity			2
one of the things that makes it different -- when you 're doing regular tv , or science fiction especially , you ca n't really argue with how music sounds			1
you can do whatever you want			2
it does n't mean it 's always tasteful , but there 's no right or wrong			2
i really wanted to embrace the restrictions of that time period -- @entity112 instrumentation , @entity112 melodies -- i really wanted to evoke that period			2
the problem was @entity95 wanted to do the opposite of that			2
it was a very modern adventure show			2
what ended up happening is actually a hybrid of both ideas			2
we ended up with this unique hybrid			2
when you hear it , ends up sounding like the show -- it does n't sound like anything else			2
@entity0 : at what point in the process of making a tv episode is the music composed ? @entity32 : i definitely know what 's coming			1
i 'm aware of where the stories are going			2
but ultimately that 's to get some preliminary ideas in the back of my mind			2
i look at the finished video to figure out what it needs -- are there shortcomings ? are there storylines not quite being communicated ? and that 's when i sit with the showrunners and get from them what they want the audience to feel and what stories they want to track			2
then i go back to my studio to add all that narrative connective tissue in a language that still stays true to the sound of the show			2
@entity0 : " @entity37 " has a memorably haunting theme			1
how did you approach making music for the apocalypse ? @entity32 : it 's funny , i had dealt with the @entity165 in " @entity36 , " " @entity166 , " " terminator : the @entity168			1
" even with " @entity170 , " i had done it			0
after a while , i had a feeling , wow , i 'm the @entity173 ! with " @entity37 , " i wanted to focus on the opposite of that			0
i wanted to let the apocalyptic events unfold naturally			0
i try to focus on the actors ' performance and try to support them			0
they 're the ones who react -- they are us			0
when @entity188 crawls out of the hospital for the first time among all the bodies , the music -- given what he 's seen and probably smelled at that time -- is pretty reserved			1
and that i think also heightens the tension			0
horror is a particularly tricky genre for television			1
it 's hard enough to scare an audience and keep them on the edge of their seat for two hours			0
you really have to pull out a lot of tricks to do that			0
we 're on hour 50 of " @entity37 " and these producers are keeping people on their toes , and keeping things fresh and keeping it scary			0
so a subtle approach helps that , because when you have a really long duration story , you want to conserve your energy as much as possible			0
@entity0 : what is your favorite type of scene to score ? your most challenging scene ? @entity32 : it 's very hard to say			1
action scenes are fun until you do a million of them			0
emotional scenes are great until you get too many in a row			0
my favorite type of scene is one that has layers to it , narratively			0
i like scenes that when i look at them , it 's not obvious what the music should be doing			1
should it be scary ? should it be funny ? what is the character thinking ? if the slightest shift in the music will make you feel sympathy to one person over another , that 's really fun and that puts the composer in a powerful position			1
there was a cue in " @entity37 " -- in the third season , the fourth episode , a major character died			0
i 'm a bit of a method actor when i write , i ca n't write music for a scene without completely taking myself to this emotion and trying to channel my feelings into music			1
when people watched it , they were gutted and heartbroken when they saw this scene			0
i had to watch it probably 70 times			0
i would be weeping sometimes , my stomach hurt			0
i was truly miserable doing that scene			0
but the key turned out pretty good and moved people			0
those sort of scenes are not fun to do			0
the process is not my idea of a good time , but the rewards are much higher			0
@entity0 : what are your favorite tv themes of all time ? @entity32 : the first tv theme that really popped up for me was " @entity280			1
" @entity74 's interesting , harmonic take , using the tritone , which sounded a little weird			0
i remember picking that up on the piano and wondering why that note was weird			0
what stoked me as a kid was " mission : impossible			0
" it is in 5/4			0
it is one of the handful of famous television theme songs that are not in 4/4 or 3/4			1
no one realized what they were hearing			0
it 's very sophisticated scoring			0
@entity0 : where do you think tv music is today ? @entity32 : ( tv has ) been a proving ground for actors , writers and directors			1
it 's changing -- it 's less the training ground to hone your skills and go onto movies			0
now , you get good at your skill and you get onto really incredible television shows			1
the scores on tv are so satisfying			1
for me -- to take it back to " @entity317 " -- it feels like a bit of a renaissance in the industry			1
@entity0 : i saw that they recently created an instrument based on @entity317 's design -- a hybrid of a piano and cello			0
@entity32 : i heard about the designs on the codex for this and planned to build this and do something with it for a future episode , having no idea this guy had built it			1
of course i was thrilled when this went up on the social media radar			0
it just puts @entity317 as a pop culture figure in the mainstream -- though he never really left			0
the mechanics are different , like a rotating keyboard and the hurdy - gurdy engine			1
@entity95 and i are talking about it and we 've got some ideas cooking .			0

music and theme songs continue to be among the most memorable parts of tv
with the arrival of prestige tv series , music on television is also gaining in esteem
