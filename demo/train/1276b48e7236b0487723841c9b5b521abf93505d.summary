@entity0 -- the prosecutor sounded like the narrator of a hard - boiled police drama as he carefully laid out pieces of the puzzle that led detectives to arrest one of their own in a 23 - year - old cold case			1
" a bite , a bullet , a gun barrel and a broken heart , that 's the evidence that will prove to you that defendant @entity23 murdered @entity23 , " deputy district attorney @entity11 told jurors as an unusual criminal trial began this week in @entity14			1
the trial promises to tell the story of a decorated female officer who rose through the ranks of the @entity28 while allegedly hiding a dark secret : she was getting away with murder			1
@entity32 , now 51 and retired from the force , is accused of killing her college crush 's new bride in 1986 , staging the crime scene to make it look like a burglary			1
yes , she was a police officer , but she did not kill in the line of duty , or to protect the public , @entity11 alleged			1
" this killing was personal			1
" @entity43 was a tall , athletic 29 - year - old hospital nursing supervisor with a pretty smile			1
she met a brutal end , beaten , bitten and shot to death in her townhouse in the suburban @entity48 on february 24 , 1986			1
she 'd also been tied up and hit over the head with a vase			1
to police , it looked like a burglary gone bad			1
stereo components were stacked by the door and @entity43 's new @entity56 , an engagement gift , was missing			2
the case intrigues because it blends soap opera suds with " csi " - style forensics -- including broken fingernails and a bite mark			1
it also promises to hold up a mirror to one of the nation 's most storied law enforcement agencies			1
" metaphorically speaking , this case is about the new @entity28 investigating the old @entity28 , " said @entity69 , who has covered the department for the @entity71 since the 1990s			1
" this trial really traces the evolution of the @entity28 and its approach to investigations , coupled with the revolutionary advances in technology			1
" he added , " there 's the old adage that the @entity28 would never go after one of its own , but this case flies in the face of that			1
" according to prosecutor @entity11 , the crime was all about a guy			2
witnesses who knew them in college at @entity91 will testify that @entity32 was smitten with @entity92 , but he just was n't that into her			2
to underscore his portrayal of @entity32 as a woman obsessed , @entity11 displayed an old photograph found during a 2009 police search of the journals she 'd stashed in a footlocker at home			1
taken at their college dorm 30 years earlier , it shows @entity92 sleeping with his back to the camera			1
he was wearing only white cotton briefs			2
@entity92 did care for @entity32 , @entity11 continued , but in his view they were just good friends -- with occasional " benefits			2
" defense attorney @entity112 told jurors there was much more to the relationship			2
the couple dated after college , went on trips and slept together " many , many times			2
" @entity32 thought it was serious and also got to know and love @entity92 's mother and brother			2
she thought they had a future , the lawyer said			2
when she learned @entity92 was marrying someone else , @entity32 decided to lay her cards on the table			2
she told him how she felt			2
they slept together one last time , and then he told her he was going ahead with his marriage to @entity43 , @entity112 said			2
" she was tearful , " he added			2
" she was n't hysterical			2
" a key part of the case involves a confrontation between @entity32 and @entity43 at the hospital where @entity43 worked , but @entity112 insisted his client was no stalker			1
by some accounts , @entity32 allegedly told her rival : " if i ca n't have him , nobody can			1
" while @entity112 acknowledged there was a meeting between the two women , he described it as more of a heads - up			1
the message from @entity32 , according to her attorney : " hey , if he 's dating you , you 'd better tell him to stop bothering me			2
tell him to knock it off			2
" at the time of the slaying , @entity32 was in her second year with the @entity28			2
the killing occurred on a monday			1
@entity32 had taken the day off ; @entity43 had called in sick that morning			0
authorities estimate she died before lunchtime			0
@entity92 found the body when he came home from work after 6 that night			0
wearing a red robe , pink t - shirt and black panties , @entity43 was sprawled on her back on the living room floor			1
by all accounts , the grim find left @entity92 dazed and despondent			0
@entity32 was a newbie patrol officer when @entity92 broke up with her for good			0
she was hurt by his rejection , sure , but she moved on and prospered , @entity112 said			0
she made detective and met her husband , a fellow @entity0 police detective , in 1993 , and they have a daughter			1
she was headed for the department 's internal affairs and its prestigious art theft detail			0
according to prosecutors , the key to unlocking @entity32 ' dark secret lay for years on the back shelf of an evidence freezer in the coroner 's office			1
a sealed evidence envelope contained a vial			0
inside that vial was a cotton swab			0
on that swab , prosecutors say , was dna taken from saliva from the bite wound on @entity43 's left forearm			0
testing in 2005 revealed the assailant was a woman			0
but still some detectives clung to the burglary theory and focused their inquiries on known female prowlers			0
from the beginning , the victim 's family had pointed to an ex-girlfriend of @entity92 's who was a cop , and as the dna testing advanced , undercover police followed @entity32 to a @entity207 store and retrieved a discarded soda from a trash can			1
saliva traces from the straw matched the bite mark dna , and she officially became a suspect			0
@entity32 was confronted , and another sample was taken from her shortly before her arrest			0
tests revealed the dna found in the bite mark on @entity43 's left forearm belonged to @entity32			0
how sure were they ? @entity11 said the chances of the killer being anyone else is " one in 1.7 sextillion			0
" that 's a 17 followed by 20 zeroes			0
@entity112 says the crime scene evidence from 1986 was mishandled and tainted years ago and ca n't be trusted			1
the envelope has been torn			0
photos show the top of the vial poking through			0
and while the top of the envelope may have been sealed with red crime lab tape , the bottom was wide open			0
@entity235 quoted the crime lab 's supervisor , who observed : " we 've got a problem			0
" hairs , fibers and fingerprints found at the crime scene ca n't be tied to @entity32 at all and have n't been matched to anyone else , @entity112 told the jury			0
the jurors listened intently monday but did n't take many notes			0
as prosecutors set the scene with their first witnesses , the images projected on a large screen were jarring : a beaming bride in white appeared one minute , followed by an image of a bloodied corpse in a red robe , arms and legs stiffened with rigor mortis			0
both photos were of @entity43 , and they were taken less than four months apart			0
her father , @entity261 , occasionally choked back sobs , and one of the victim 's sisters teared up at the sight of the bloodied face with one eye blackened and swollen shut			0
@entity23 " wore the white dress that the defendant felt was hers , " @entity11 said			1
" four months after that marriage , @entity23 was dead , her beauty disfigured , obliterated , blotted from existence			1
" @entity32 , dressed in black for court , appeared pale and waxy as she jotted notes and whispered with her attorneys			0
during breaks , she waved at her husband , mother and brother , who were seated behind her			0
@entity11 reminded jurors what life was like in 1986			0
@entity288 had the top - rated television show			1
people played @entity291 and @entity292 and hardly anybody had a home computer			0
and few , except for scientists , had heard of dna			0
the genetic testing that is now the " gold standard of evidence , " was yet to come , @entity11 reminded the jury			0
" a tiny @entity23 was hiding in the bite on @entity23 's arm , " he said			1
the @entity304 trial in 1994 and 1995 helped cement dna as a household word			1
ten years later , the @entity28 launched its cold case squad , reopening hundreds of files to see , as @entity11 said , " if there were more killers hiding on evidence shelves in coroners ' freezers			1
" it will be up to eight women and four men to decide if @entity32 is one of them .			0
