-- a chemical found in many sodas may be dangerous to your health , @entity1 says			0
and no , it 's not sugar ( this time )			0
the golden - brown color of many soft drinks comes with a dose of the chemical 4 - methylimidazole , or @entity12			1
on @entity15 product labels it appears simply as " caramel coloring			0
" those who say the chemical may possibly cause cancer include the @entity21 's @entity20 and the state of @entity23 , which now limits manufacturers to 29 micrograms of exposure for the average consumer per day			1
foods exceeding that limit have to carry a warning label that reads : " warning : this product contains a chemical known to the @entity23 to cause cancer			2
" but when @entity1 purchased sodas in @entity23 and had them analyzed by a lab , it found that one 12 - ounce serving of @entity38 or @entity39 exceeded the levels permitted without a warning label			1
ten other brands tested by the group did meet the @entity23 standard , which is estimated to limit the risk of cancer from @entity12 to one case in every 100,000 lifetimes of daily exposure			0
" we are concerned about both the levels of @entity12 we found in many of the soft drinks tested and the variations observed among brands , especially given the widespread consumption of these types of beverages , " said dr. @entity50 , a @entity1 toxicologist , in a statement			2
" there is no reason why consumers need to be exposed to this avoidable and unnecessary risk that can stem from coloring food and beverages brown			0
" the @entity67 does not set federal limits on @entity12 in food , and the data gathered by @entity1 show that in some cases consumers outside @entity23 are drinking a slightly different ingredient			1
for example , @entity38 purchased by the group in december in @entity75 contains four times as much 4 - mei as the same product bought that same month in @entity23			2
what is clean eating ? currently the @entity67 has no reason to believe that 4 - @entity82 poses a health risk to consumers at the levels found in foods with caramel coloring , agency spokeswoman @entity80 told @entity0 in an e-mail			1
the government agency is testing a variety of food and beverages with the chemical and reviewing safety data to determine if any regulatory action needs to be taken , she said			1
consumers interested in more information on 4 - @entity82 can check out the @entity67 's faq page			1
in a statement to @entity1 , @entity99 said data indicate that the average person consumes less than one - third a can of diet soda per day ; therefore , its product meets the @entity23 standard , even if a complete serving exceeds that limit			2
in addition to new federal standards , @entity1 is calling on the @entity67 to " require labeling of specific caramel colors in the ingredient lists of food where it is added , so consumers can make informed choices			0
" " first and foremost , consumers can rest assured that our industry 's beverages are safe , " the @entity117 said in a statement			0
" contrary to the conclusions of @entity1 , @entity67 has noted there is no reason at all for any health concerns , a position supported by regulatory agencies around the world			0
" however , the companies that make caramel coloring for our members ' soft drinks are now producing it to contain less 4 - @entity12 , and nationwide use of this new caramel coloring is underway			1
" @entity15 mom wants @entity140 @entity139			0
