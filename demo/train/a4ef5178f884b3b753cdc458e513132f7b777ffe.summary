-- over the past five years evictions have become a symbol of @entity4 's economic crisis , but the latest homeowner to face the prospect of homelessness -- an 85 - year - old woman -- has found an unlikely guardian angel			1
one of the poorest football teams in @entity4 's top division , @entity12 club @entity11 , has promised to help @entity13 find a new apartment after she was evicted by her landlord			1
from the @entity17 district of the @entity4 capital , @entity13 had lived in the apartment for half a century but could n't pay the rent after her son had used her home as collateral on a loan he was then unable to repay			1
according to statistics published by the @entity26 , 1,218 evictions took place between january and june 2014 -- an increase of 17 % from the same period in the previous year			1
back in 2012 it 's estimated that there were up to 200 evictions a day as @entity4 suffered the consequences of a housing bubble that burst after the housing market crashed in 2007 - 2008 , while unemployment also soared			1
@entity13 's story grabbed the attention of the club with fans holding aloft a banner which read " @entity11 against evictions " in a recent league match			1
" i know that there are lots of cases like hers , " @entity11 coach @entity44 told reporters			1
" the worst thing that can happen to a family is when they evict you from your home , " added @entity44			0
" this is a lady who lived in her home for 50 years and due to her doing an honorable act -- being the guarantor of her son , which everyone in the world would undoubtedly do			1
" @entity44 has been in touch with @entity13 , who according to @entity4 media , was unaware of the $ 50,000 loan her son had taken out			2
he promised it was n't just him that would try and help @entity13 , but that the " the coaching staff , the players , the club " would also become involved			1
@entity44 added : " within our ability , we will help this lady and give her a hand so that she finds a place to live with dignity and so she does n't feel alone			2
" i 'm very proud we can lend her a hand			0
i 'd like to help more people , but that 's impossible			0
" what is within our power , we will do			0
also , we will start an initiative so that anyone who wants to help will have the ability to lend a hand			0
we are very sensitive to this and what happened to her could happen to anyone			0
" @entity11 has an annual budget of around $ 8.6 million -- a total which is incomparable to that of its big city neighbor @entity12 which has a cool $ 720 million at its disposal			2
speaking to @entity4 newspaper @entity97 , @entity13 praised the club for the " beautiful gesture			1
" she added : " a thousand times thank you , @entity102 bless them , " she said			0
" it 's a beautiful gesture that they did n't need to do and @entity11 ! " if i see [ @entity44 ] i 'll give him 40 kisses			2
but the only time i 've seen him was during the neighborhood fairs			0
" we always supported @entity11 in this family			2
i remember when we used to go to the swimming pools , which were right next to the stadium			0
but now we have different motivations to support them			0
" i 'm certain my husband is showing his gratitude in heaven			0
