@entity1 , @entity0 -- always short of time ? not enough moments in the day ? tonight you 'll get an extra second to enjoy 2008			0
use it wisely ; perhaps an extra long smooch is called for			0
an extra second will be added to 2008 to align clocks with variations in the @entity12 's time			1
immediately before midnight a leap second -- the first for three years -- will be added to atomic clocks around the world by official timekeepers			1
@entity18 , a senior research scientist at @entity20 's @entity19 , said the @entity12 's erratic rotation meant an extra second needed to be added			1
" the difference between atomic time and @entity12 time has now built up to the point where it needs to be corrected , so this @entity29 we will experience a rare 61 second minute at the very end of 2008 and revelers ... will have an extra second to celebrate			1
" traditionally time has been based on the passage of the @entity35 across the sky -- a modern version of this is still used by astronomers to track distant stars and spacecraft			0
however , since 1967 , an atomic timescale -- the extremely accurate @entity42 ( @entity42 ) -- has been the world 's official clock and is used for broadcasting time signals across the world			1
the accuracy of @entity42 is essential for the smooth running of the @entity49			0
by comparison , the @entity12 is far less reliable			2
it does not rotate at a constant speed -- it can even wobble -- and disruptions to its core , extreme weather , volcanic eruptions and earthquakes can influence the length of a day			0
therefore , leap seconds are occasionally added to align atomic time with astronomical time and ensure that the @entity35 remains overhead at noon			2
@entity18 told @entity20 media anyone sober enough and who had a digital clock that picked up leap second information from a reliable source , would see the final seconds of 2008 as 57 , 58 , 59 , 60 , 00 -- with 60 being the extra second .			0

a leap second will be added to atomic clocks on @entity29
additional second is needed because the @entity12 " wobbles "
@entity12 's official timekeepers will add the second to atomic clocks
