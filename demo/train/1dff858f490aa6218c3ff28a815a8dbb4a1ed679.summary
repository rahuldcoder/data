@entity0 -- @entity2 is reaching into @entity4 's playbook for avoiding jail : go to rehab before your court date			2

" @entity2 has elected to enter a rehab facility , " said a statement tuesday night from his representative			0
" his goal is to gain focus and insight into his past and recent behavior , enabling him to continue the pursuit of his life and his career from a healthier vantage point			0
" there has been no indication that @entity2 , 24 , has a substance abuse problem			0
the behavior that has landed him in legal trouble over the past several years has been anger management			1
@entity2 's brutal attack on former girlfriend @entity34 on the eve of the @entity36 in february 2009 resulted in a felony domestic violence conviction that carried a lengthy probation period			1
a judge found him in violation of that probation in august because of discrepancies in proving he fulfilled the court - ordered 1,400 hours of community labor			1
he imposed another 1,000 hours of work			0
the @entity47 district attorney appears in no mood to cut @entity2 any breaks , which suggests that prosecutors will ask for jail time for him because of the arrest early sunday in the shadow of the @entity54			0
while the simple assault charge in @entity57 is a misdemeanor , it could trigger a probation revocation			1
