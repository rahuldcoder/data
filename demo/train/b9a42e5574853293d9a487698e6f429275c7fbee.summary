-- these young rappers today -- they use slang that no one in politics quite understands			2
politics today -- jumping on every opportunity to slam an opponent			0
so in @entity7 on thursday , when a video profile of @entity10 gubernatorial candidate @entity9 was released by a blogger , neither the blogger nor the @entity14 's campaign say they realized a song featured in the video included sexually graphic lyrics about a top @entity19 in the state			1
here 's what happened : blogger @entity22 , who is co-founder of the production company @entity24 , produced a day - in - the life video of @entity9 , who is locked in a three - way race for governor			1
under images of @entity9 doing his work for the day are lyrics from the song " @entity36 " by @entity7 - based rapper @entity32 -- yes , @entity7 has rappers -- that includes a sexually explicit lyric about @entity35 sen. @entity35			1
( @entity37 is not a candidate in the gubernatorial race			2
) the @entity40 saw the video and understood the meaning of the lyric , " i 've got @entity35 givin ' everybody brain			1
" brain is apparently a term for specific sexual acts			0
the @entity40 called on the @entity9 campaign to " denounce , cease promoting , and take down " the video			1
all of which the @entity9 campaign did immediately once it learned the meaning of the lyric , spokesperson @entity48 said			1
the @entity40 saved the video , however , and shared it with interested media			1
" the @entity9 campaign did not produce this video or have any control or advance knowledge of its contents			1
we do not condone the offensive song lyrics included in it , " @entity48 said			0
he said the video was " absolutely independently done			0
we received no payments from the campaign			0
" he also said he thought the term was meant to be " an endorsement " of @entity37 , who he described as a highly regarded @entity19 in the state			1
he saidhe learned of the meaning of the word when he woke up friday morning with a press release from the @entity40 in his in - box			2
@entity37 , meanwhile will not weigh in			0
she has " no comment , " spokesman @entity70 said			0
@entity32 , however , has relished the attention , tweeting , " @entity74 to @ mainegop for all the free press ! ! ! ; ) " as for the future of the video , @entity22 says he 's going to take out that lyric and republish the video			0
as for a political liability for @entity9 ? probably not			2
but it 's a headache for the campaign			0
by the way , @entity9 , who is currently a congressman , did not vote for arming @entity86 rebels to fight @entity87			2
he said the @entity89 " can not afford to engage in another open - ended military conflict			0

@entity40 jumps on video about @entity10 candidate @entity9
it contained sexually explicit lyrics about @entity19 sen. @entity35
a blogger produced the video , says he did *n't* know what the slang meant
