in his @entity2 address , president @entity0 proposed making community college tuition free for two years to boost college graduation rates and lift more people into the middle class			1
unfortunately , his plan does n't make the grade			0
the proposal would not only pile up more debt by further subsidizing runaway college costs , it would also perilously undercut the emergence of more innovative educational programs designed to help students succeed in the workforce			1
offering only a lukewarm pathway to the job market , community colleges are incapable of fulfilling the president 's lofty ambitions			2
although there are some high - performing community colleges and stellar stories of success for certain students , the overall picture of success at two - year community colleges is dismal			2
according to the @entity32 at @entity33 , @entity34 , only 22 % of students graduate within three years , and 28 % graduate within four			2
more telling , 80 % of students say they want a bachelor 's degree or higher , and yet only 20 % of these students transfer to a four - year institution within five years			2
even for those who earn a community college degree , it often is n't as useful as other options			1
thanks to credential inflation , pursuing a professional certification — which more clearly indicates a person 's skills than a degree — often pays off better than an associate 's degree , according to @entity53 data			0
the conversation around making community college free also masks a larger problem , which is that community colleges are already heavily subsidized and far less affordable than commonly believed			1
at $ 3,300 , community college tuition is well under the $ 5,730 currently available in @entity61 aid to low - income students			1
but the expenditure per student at a community college — the true cost of the education — is far higher , about four times more at $ 13,000 per student			1
that means that more than 60 % of the cost of community college is n't paid for through tuition , but through various forms of government aid at the federal , state and local levels			1
as a result , even if the president 's plan passed , it would n't help the large number of already - overcrowded community colleges that have waiting lists numbering in the thousands			2
tuition is only a small part of the funding needed to educate additional students			0
what 's more , because of the limited productivity gains possible in the community college model , those costs will continue to rise , which means that tuition will , too			1
the proposal 's $ 60 billion price over 10 years is likely to grow with only a questionable return on the investment			0
opinion : two years of free community college makes sense the larger question the proposal misses is not how to allow students to afford college , but how to make college affordable			1
there 's a huge distinction			0
the focus should be to make postsecondary education less costly and of better quality , such that the question of how to afford it becomes manageable			0
the president 's proposal merely charges education , in the form of debt for future generations of taxpayers , rather than changes it			0
instead we need to encourage students to seek innovative offerings that are lower cost and improve the quality and accessibility of higher education			0
@entity130 offers a new online , competency - based program that charges undergraduate tuition of $ 350 per month , or $ 1,316 per term			0
tuition includes access to as many courses as one can complete and all the ebooks and course materials needed , and @entity138 receives no government funding			0
another online , competency - based program , @entity142 's @entity141 , charges annual tuition of $ 2,500			0
rather than supporting innovative options like @entity138 and @entity142 , the president 's plan would nudge students toward a community college sector that is incapable of repositioning its model around student success and fuel rising college costs			1
5 ways community colleges are fixing higher education if enacted , the president 's proposal would be unlikely to achieve its ultimate aims and would exacerbate a larger problem lurking behind college financing			2
although the plan amounts to little more than political posturing given the current congressional makeup , it will negatively influence the political conversation around higher education in the years ahead			0
by supporting free community college , president @entity0 is merely kicking the can down the road for future generations to confront			1
we need a better strategy for skills training overall before we go further down the track of subsidizing students to attend community college only to emerge with little to show for it .			1

in his sotu , president @entity0 proposed making community college tuition free for two years
@entity183 : we need a better strategy for skills training before going down the track of subsidizing students
