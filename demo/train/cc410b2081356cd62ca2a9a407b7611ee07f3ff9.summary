-- @entity1 and his female counterparts @entity2 and @entity4 have transformed @entity5 into one of the leading tennis nations in the world with their well - chronicled achievements in the past few seasons			1
@entity1 reached a career high ranking of number two in the world earlier this year , @entity4 went one better and briefly topped the women 's rankings in 2008 while @entity2 claimed grand slam glory at the @entity18 in the same year			1
it is a remarkable record for a country of approximately 10 million people and with no great tradition in tennis , rather a passion for team sports such as football ( @entity5 qualified for the 2010 @entity28 finals ) and basketball			2
@entity1 aside , @entity5 has also produced @entity30 and @entity31 , who are both ranked in the top 50 on the @entity33 tour , giving them a formidable @entity36 team			1
with @entity1 leading the way and winning the conclusive rubber against @entity39 , @entity5 beat the might of the @entity41 in the @entity43 first round earlier this month to reach the quarterfinals of the competition for the first time			1

in times past the two countries formed part of the old @entity54 , who reached the last four of the competition in 1988 , the following year , and 1991			0
the @entity5 women 's team reached the @entity43 playoffs of the @entity43 in 2007 , but with @entity4 and @entity2 in the ranks have the potential to challenge for top honors in years to come			1
@entity1 puts an unusual slant on the reasons for the success of the current crop of @entity5 players , tracing it back to the crisis of 1999 when @entity70 planes bombed @entity71 before the regime of president @entity73 was removed			1
@entity1 celebrated his 12th birthday during the bombings and like other youngsters was not allowed to go to school because of the dangerous situation			2
it left him and other leading players with no alternative but to practice tennis for four or five hours on end day after day			0
" but still you know it ( the war ) gave me a lot of hours on the tennis court and i was very happy about it , " he told @entity0			0
" but in those conditions , in those times , you have players like @entity4 , @entity2 , @entity30 , myself , all these guys went through that			1
" i think it is a question that has been raised and asked to all of us , for last two , three years , how come you are coming from such a small country with so many problems and you still managed to become top players you know , " he added			0
@entity1 says that the bonds that were forged in those trying times has given all those involved a double sense of purpose			0
" as a small country we got united in those critical times and we supported each other and right now that the country is prospering and it has turned its intentions towards the @entity112 and i am happy with the situation as it is now , " he added			0
prior to the current clutch of star players , the most famous home - grown talent produced by @entity5 was former world number one @entity118 , who fostered her talent in the old @entity54			2
@entity118 was born in @entity121 and at the age of 11 won her category at the renowned @entity125 tournament in @entity126 where she was spotted by noted coach @entity127			0
