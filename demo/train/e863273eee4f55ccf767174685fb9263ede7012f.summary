@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 just published an article entitled , " @entity5 ? " it appears in the june issue , the month in which fathers are celebrated -- not dismissed -- and concludes that fathers are not essential			1
the primary problem with the article is that it fails to ask its title question to the right group of people			2
what makes a man a father is the fact that he has children			0
had the writer of the piece , @entity22 , asked her question of children , she would have gotten a much different answer			0
instead , @entity27 reaches her conclusion that fathers are not necessary by pointing to some researchers who think there are limitations in the available social science research on families			1
specifically , @entity27 references research that questions the data on the importance of father involvement because it compares mother - father families to single mother families			1
even though research shows that mother - father families produce better outcomes for children , @entity27 writes that it 's unclear whether its the father himself who makes a unique difference , and not just the additional financial and emotional resources a second parent can bring			1
in this case , it is some writers , not kids , who say the darndest things			2
the problem with @entity27 's observation is that in the real world , the actual option most people get is between a single mother family and a mother - father family			1
the research is not limited by offering those two scenarios as the basis for its findings -- it is addressing the reality on the ground			2
despite advances in science , the overwhelming majority of children still come into the world as a result of a man and a woman having sex with each other			0
so , the question is not , " are fathers necessary ? " it is " are fathers going to be involved and what does that involvement look like ? " the answer to the second question is what makes social scientists so concerned about the benefits of father involvement and the costs of father absence			0
the reality we are facing as a nation is that one out of every three children lives in a father - absent home and four in 10 are born to unmarried mothers			0
so , let 's " ask " the children if they think fathers are necessary			0
my organization just gave its @entity106 to master sgt. @entity107 of the @entity108			0
at the ceremony , as he accepted his award on stage , i noticed his 10 - year - old son , @entity112 , was so overcome with emotion that tears streamed down his face			0
it was @entity112 who motivated his mom to nominate his dad for the award			1
when asked how he feels when his dad is deployed overseas , @entity112 said he is overwhelmed from the pressure of thinking he needs to step into his father 's shoes while he is away			0
his inability to do so causes him a lot of pain			0
if we ask @entity112 if fathers are necessary , would he say no ? sgt. @entity107 and millions of fathers in this country mean the world to their children			1
i believe that each child has a hole in his soul in the shape of his dad , and when fathers are unable or unwilling to fill that hole , it leaves a wound that is not easily healed			1
i know -- i grew up without my dad			0
that is why the article in the @entity3 is so troubling			1
good fathers are not just necessary , they are essential and irreplaceable to the children who desperately love and need them			2
you see , in the real world , we do not have the luxury of finessing research data to reach irrelevant conclusions about families			1
here in the real world , we have fathers asking , " what is expected of me ? " if our society is not prepared to say , without question or hesitation , that we expect them to provide for , love , and guide their children , then we have indeed lost our way			1
and there is no question about that			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			2

@entity164 says @entity3 *magazine* article questions whether fathers are essential
he says article reaches *faulty* conclusion that new research shows dads not crucial
real - world data *analysis* shows kids in mom - dad families do better
@entity164 : do *n't* believe it ? ask kids . each child has a hole in his soul in the shape of his dad
