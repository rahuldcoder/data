-- at least 29 students died in a february 25 attack on a college in @entity4 , northeastern @entity5 , during which several buildings were torched			2
the attackers escaped the scene , but @entity5 's military suspects that the militant group @entity10 , which has wreaked havoc in the region for several years , are the perpetrators			1
the @entity15 government is struggling to control the bloodshed between the mainly @entity18 north and @entity20 south that has claimed more than 3,000 lives since @entity10 came to prominence in 2009 , according to @entity23			1
who are @entity10 ? @entity10 means " @entity26 education is a sin			0
" the group 's ambitions range from the stricter enforcement of @entity32 law -- which is derived from the @entity33 as the " world of @entity35 " -- across the predominantly @entity18 north of @entity5 , to the total destruction of the @entity15 state and its government			1
what 's causing the unrest ? armed militant groups in @entity5 's northeastern region are nothing new , but @entity10 has taken the violence to unprecedented levels since 2009 , murdering and kidnapping @entity46 and bombing schools and churches			1
in late 2013 , @entity23 said @entity10 had abducted scores of women and girls and used children as young as 13 in their campaign of violence			0
the country 's immense oil wealth is concentrated in the south , while the predominantly @entity18 north remains extremely poor			1
there were riots and accusations of vote - rigging when former military ruler gen. @entity63 , much of the north 's favored candidate for president , lost to @entity67 , who hails from the south , in the 2011 national election			2
what 's the @entity15 government doing about it ? in mid-may the @entity15 government declared a state of emergency in three northeastern states -- @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 state -- and created the @entity79 wing of the military to try to stamp out the insurgency			2
a media blackout has also ensued , which ensures that communications in and out of the remote area are nearly impossible and that the @entity15 military can operate out of the media spotlight			0
the military has been accused of committing atrocities against civilians by @entity23 and @entity90			2
after raising concerns with @entity5 's foreign minister last may , @entity92 secretary of state @entity91 said : " the government has acknowledged that there have been some problems ... they 're working to try to control it			1
" in november 2013 , @entity5 's national assembly extended the state of emergency for a further six months at the president 's request			1
is the violence a purely sectarian dispute ? while it 's easy to frame the violence as @entity108 versus @entity18 , it 's much more than sectarian			0
@entity10 will attack other @entity18 when they feel they 're not adhering to strict @entity32 law			1
meanwhile , the @entity79 's actions in the region are n't winning them any fans -- and there are also vigilante thugs who stop and search cars entering northeastern cities like @entity118			0
why has @entity10 attacked mosques in the past ? @entity10 does n't view all @entity18 as supporters and allies -- and there have been suggestions that the group is attacking certain mosques because members of that mosque have assisted the @entity79 in tracking members of the militant group			2
does @entity10 enjoy support from the people ? although the northern populace mostly abhors the violence , there is considerable local sympathy and support for @entity32 law , seen by many as the only way to put an end to what is widely regarded as a corrupt and inept government			1
@entity5 has some of the worst human development indicators in the world -- and as the military struggles to stop the spread of attacks from @entity10 's base in the northeast , the militant group is winning perhaps its most important battle : making @entity15 question the competency of their government			1
could the violence spread to other countries ? it already has			0
@entity10 is active in neighboring @entity157 , where a @entity159 family was kidnapped in february 2013 , as well as a @entity159 priest in november that year			0
and in a video released in august 2013 , the group 's leader , @entity161 , said : " our strength and firepower is bigger than that of @entity5			0
@entity5 is no longer a big deal to us , as far as we are concerned			0
we will now comfortably confront the @entity92			0
" the @entity92 says the group has links to the @entity171 affiliate in @entity172 , and extremist groups in @entity174			1
in march 2011 , gen. @entity175 , then the commander of @entity176 , warned @entity177 that @entity10 elements " aspire to a broader regional level of attacks , " including against @entity92 and @entity179 interests			2
why is n't the international community stepping in ? in november 2013 , the @entity184 designated @entity10 and its offshoot @entity185 as " terrorist organizations , " legally enabling @entity188 to take various steps against the groups , their members and their supporters			0
a year earlier it had designated the leader of @entity10 as a terrorist and put a $ 7 million bounty on his head , in addition to providing technical and financial support to the @entity15 teams fighting on the ground			0
but there 's a growing international reluctance to put boots on the ground unless there 's a direct national security threat to the @entity172 , like in the case of the @entity159 intervention in @entity174 last year			0
why is @entity5 so important to the region and rest of the world ? what 's the role of oil ? @entity5 , with nearly 175 million people , is considered the political and economic powerhouse of @entity172			1
@entity220 in oil , the country is a key @entity92 partner and has a massive banking sector			1
@entity222 is the biggest trade partner for @entity172 , and @entity5 is the hub of global business in the region			2
@entity227 contributed to this report .			0

@entity5 is battling an @entity231 insurgency that has claimed 3,000 lives since 2009
@entity10 is fighting for stricter @entity32 law in @entity5 's predominately @entity18 north
rights groups have blamed both @entity10 and the military for atrocities against civilians
