@entity0 , @entity1 -- the prosecution and defense have made their cases , and now judge @entity6 must decide : did @entity7 intentionally kill his girlfriend @entity8 ? was it murder ? she will begin reading her decision thursday			1
the judge has to answer several questions to reach her verdict on the murder charge , one of four charges @entity7 faces			1
first -- and most important -- did @entity7 know @entity8 was behind the door in his bathroom when he fired four shots through it on @entity22 last year , killing her ? if the answer is yes , beyond a reasonable doubt , @entity7 knew he was shooting at his girlfriend , then the judge will find him guilty of murder			1
later , she 'll have to decide whether it was premeditated			0
if she thinks it was , he could be sentenced to life in prison			0
in @entity1 that means he 'll have to serve at least 25 years			1
if she thinks the murder was n't premeditated , @entity7 could get a minimum of 15 years behind bars			1
but if @entity6 is not convinced that @entity7 knew @entity8 was behind the door -- if there is any reasonable doubt of that -- he will not be convicted of murder			1
@entity7 argues he made a mistake -- that he thought was trying to defend himself from an intruder			2
if @entity6 accepts that as plausible , she will then have to decide if his mistake and his actions were reasonable			2
if she says they were not , she 'll find him guilty of a crime called culpable homicide			0
there is no minimum sentence for culpable homicide in @entity1 law -- @entity6 will decide the punishment herself , taking @entity1 precedent into account			1
and there 's one final possibility			0
if the judge does not think the prosecution has proved its case -- if she believes there is a reasonable chance @entity7 made a reasonable mistake and responded reasonably -- she will find him not guilty , and @entity7 could be a free man			1
@entity6 will make her decision with the assistance of two experts known as assessors			2
@entity1 does not have jury trials			0
@entity70 charges @entity7 faces three other weapons charges in addition to the murder accusation			2
two charges are related to allegations that he recklessly fired a gun in public -- once in a restaurant in 2012 , and once out of the sunroof of a car in 2013			0
the maximum penalty for each charge is five years behind bars			0
if he is convicted of either , he could face a lesser sentence , such as a fine or the loss of his gun license			0
the final charge is that @entity7 was found to have ammunition without a proper license when police searched his home after he killed @entity8			1
@entity7 says he was storing the ammunition in his safe for his father			0
the charge is potentially a very serious one			0
if he is found guilty , he could face up to 15 years in prison , though @entity6 could opt for a lesser punishment such as a fine or the loss of his gun license			2
@entity7 trial closing arguments end who was @entity8 ? who is ' @entity7 ' @entity7 ? @entity2 's @entity103 contributed to this report .			1

judge @entity6 must answer several questions to determine her ruling
if @entity7 knew he was shooting at @entity8 , he committed murder
