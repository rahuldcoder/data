in our @entity3 series , @entity1 correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events			1
@entity1 's @entity9 accompanied a @entity11 unit in @entity12 , @entity13 , and experienced the variety and the danger of law enforcement life firsthand			1
@entity1 's @entity9 pulls his weight on ride - along with 64 lbs. of marijuana seized by law enforcement			1
@entity12 , @entity13 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity12 , @entity13 , is a small city			1
just more than 20,000 people live here , according to the 2005 census			0
but spend a couple of days here with law enforcement , and your head will spin			1
almost half of all illegal drugs seized from @entity31 last year were seized in the eastern @entity13 region , and @entity12 is the largest border city in this @entity34 border patrol sector			1
in the past six months , the @entity11 has seized about 500,000 pounds of illegal drugs here , which is 15 percent higher than the previous six months			1
each day , hundreds of people are arrested , mostly for immigration violations but many for drug and weapons crimes			0
the temporary jail cells in the @entity11 station in @entity12 are often overflowing			1
the @entity11 boss in this sector says his agents were assaulted 260 times within the past year			1
one night this week , we saw the danger and variety of lawbreaking activity experienced here quite vividly			0
at the immigration checkpoint set up a half - hour north of @entity12 on @entity51 , a semi truck is pulled over when the drug - sniffing dog detects something			1
the back of the truck is opened , and inside are thousands of tomatoes , but the dog is still not happy			1
the truck is taken back to the @entity11 station , and agents climb over the tomatoes			1
and that 's where they find the stash			2
@entity65 and bales of dope			0
nine hundred eight pounds , to be exact			2
at a street value of $ 800 a pound , the authorities estimate they kept $ 720,000 worth of marijuana off the streets			2
i interview the man arrested for driving the shipment			0
the operating theory : that he is doing dirty work for one of the @entity31 cartels			1
but the @entity31 man tells me he is not scared , because " i was just carrying tomatoes			1
" he claims that he knew nothing about the nearly half - ton of pot. the man will be telling that to the judge and could face significant time in an @entity34 prison			2
illegal drugs consume the day of all law enforcement people here			1
we drive with the @entity11 in the late hours of the night and hear a call over the radio that two men have been spotted jumping the border wall with backpacks			1
the chase is on , and another dog is brought to the area			0
the men disappear , but the dog picks up a scent in the heavy , hilly brush			0
@entity104 the drug - sniffing dog is taught to sit when she finds something			0
she suddenly sits and then jumps on what looks like bushes			0
it turns out the bushes are actually attached to sacks of marijuana			2
two 25 - pound sacks full of pot. they were abandoned by the men when they ran away after being spotted			0
street value , at least $ 40,000			0
@entity116 , the agent who works with @entity104 , told me that over the past two years , @entity104 has found nearly 7,000 pounds of pot. but @entity116 also is pretty heroic			1
just a couple of weeks ago , he was shot in the leg when a man he was chasing committed suicide			0
the bullet passed through the man 's face and into @entity116 's knee			2
law enforcement life here is not for the squeamish			1
before we leave this area , we go to a rural area west of @entity12 where we hear illegal immigrants and drug couriers often try to get into the @entity34			2
when we get there , we see why			0
the tall border fence abruptly ends as it gets close to a small mountain , but there is plenty of space for people to squeeze into the @entity34			0
we wander about 10 feet into @entity31 to look at some of the clothes , water bottles and cigarette boxes that people have left behind			1
as we get ready to leave , we see a @entity11 vehicle zooming towards us			2
they do n't know we 're with @entity1 ; they think we may be criminals			2
one of the four agents points his rifle at us and demands that we keep our hands in plain sight			0
they search our car , and we tell them who we are and what we 're doing			0
they say they spotted us because of their long - range video cameras			0
they tell us to give them a heads up next time we go exploring , and all is well			0
the agents did their job well			0
but there are only so many of them and an immense amount of border			0
after spending time with these agents , it 's easy to see how sometimes what they do feels like a thankless task .			2
