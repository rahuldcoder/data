the @entity2 peacekeepers failed to protect the men -- most of whom were killed after they were taken away by @entity15 forces -- and the state should compensate the families of the men for their loss , the @entity10 in the @entity11 said			1
the civil case against the @entity2 state was brought by the mothers of @entity23 in connection with the massacre of nearly 8,000 @entity27 men and boys in @entity8 , one of the worst atrocities of the @entity32 conflict			1
the @entity33 had sought refuge in the compound of the @entity2 peacekeeping force , known as @entity37 , when the @entity15 forces overran the town			2
but the peacekeepers , who were under the command of a @entity41 deployed after the collapse of the former @entity43 , allowed them to be taken away by the @entity15			0
@entity2 liable for deaths of 3 @entity27 men in @entity7 " given the information @entity37 had about the fate of the male refugees at the time and because of the special position of the compound -- a fenced - in area where they had full control -- they should not have participated in the deportation of the more than 300 men , " a court news release on the ruling said			1
" the court considers that at the end of the afternoon of 13 july 1995 , @entity37 should have taken into account the possibility that these men would be the victim of genocide and that it can be said with sufficient certainty that , had @entity37 allowed them to stay at the compound , these men would have remained alive			0

the @entity92 had designated @entity8 a " safe area " for @entity33 , known as @entity7 , as the @entity15 forces carried out a campaign of ethnic cleansing			2
the massacre there , which the @entity92 peacekeepers failed to prevent , was the worst in @entity100 since the end of @entity102 last september , the @entity103 ruled in a separate case that the @entity2 state was liable for the deaths of three @entity33 who were sent away from the @entity37 compound outside @entity8 and subsequently killed by the @entity15 army and allied paramilitary groups			1
meanwhile , the trial of former @entity15 leader @entity111 and former @entity15 army chief @entity112 continues at the @entity113 in the @entity11			0
