-- do you prefer to get a text message or a phone call if someone wants to reach you on your cell phone ? according to a new study from the @entity9 , 31 % of @entity7 adults prefer text messages to phone calls			1
an additional 14 % said the contact method they prefer depends on the situation			2
to put this in perspective , most @entity7 ( but just barely : 53 % ) still generally prefer to get voice calls rather than text messages			1
also , @entity9 notes that 4 % of cell owners do not make or receive any voice calls on an average day			1
and 27 % of cell owners do not use text messaging , even occasionally			1
not surprisingly , younger adults are especially likely to use texting			2
according to @entity9 , " cell owners between the ages of 18 and 24 exchange an average of 109.5 messages on a normal day -- more than 3,200 texts per month			1
and the typical or median cell owner in this age group sends or receives 50 messages per day ( or 1500 messages per month )			2
" also , the rate of texting for 18 - to 24 - year - olds is " more than double the comparable figure for 25 - 34 year olds , and 23 times the figure for text messaging users who are 65 or older			1
" whether individuals prefer to get text messages rather than voice calls appears to have a large correlation with how heavily they use text messaging			1
for instance , 55 % of people who send or receive more than 51 texts per day report preferring them to phone calls			1
however , since younger adults are most likely to be heavy texters , this preference does indirectly correlate with age			0
why some prefer texting why do some people prefer texting to voice calls ? @entity9 did not speculate on this , but @entity58 suggests some relative advantages of texting			1
first , privacy : it 's far less likely that an @entity64 conversation can be overheard			0
( conversely , this can also be a matter of courtesy ; do n't you wish more people in public settings would use text messaging rather than voice calls , if they must communicate with someone right that minute ? ) also , text messaging provides greater accessibility , not just for people with hearing impairments but also to compensate for ambient noise , weak or spotty cell network connections , or the poor quality of microphones and speakers that plague many cell phones			1
but perhaps the main reasons why many people prefer getting text messages over voice calls are related to time			1
typically , text messaging encourages briefer , more efficient exchanges of information			0
even " social grooming " chitchat often gets abbreviated so it 's quicker to type and read -- although in the context of texting culture , this is n't necessarily viewed as colder or less socially or emotionally significant			0
similarly , there 's less psychological or social pressure to respond immediately to texts			0
so you can take a moment to finish a task at hand ( such as parking your car ) or to consider what you want to say before responding to a text message			0
text messaging also can reduce the discomfort or impatience some people experience with pauses in real - time voice conversations -- or the chance that they may instantly blurt a response that they 'd later regret			2
a text - messaging decline ? if today 's young adults ' taste for text messaging persists as they age , this could spell big changes for how wireless carriers do business in the future			2
@entity9 notes that voice calls and texting -- the two main services conducted over cell phone carriers ' basic networks , rather than their data networks , for which they typically charge extra -- appear to have plateaued in the @entity7 " both text messaging and phone calling on cell phones have leveled off for the adult population as a whole , " said the report			1
" text messaging users send or receive an average of 41.5 messages on a typical day , with the median user sending or receiving 10 texts daily -- both figures are largely unchanged from what we reported in 2010			1
similarly , cell owners make or receive an average of 12 calls on their cells per day , which is unchanged from 2010			1
" a plateau -- or even an eventual decline -- in the popularity of both voice calls and text messages could profoundly change how carriers charge for voice calls and text messaging in coming years			1
in the long term , this might even lead some wireless carriers to abandon the direct telephony business or to treat it as a specialized service			0
right now , voice calling and text messaging packages are primary revenue sources for wireless carriers			2
these services are provided to virtually every cell phone , including the 65 % of @entity7 mobile phones that are not smartphones and so do n't necessarily include data plans at this time			1
internet calling but there are many options for placing voice calls over the @entity171 ( @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 and more ) using voice over internet protocol ( @entity178 ) technology			1
these services generally are not tied to a particular device , so you can access your @entity178 account from your computer , tablet or phone -- or even a shared device			0
@entity178 calling systems tend to be more complex for consumers to set up , learn and use than simply dialing a phone number to make a regular phone call			0
they also can be quirkier or less reliable than standard phone calls			0
but in coming years , these services probably will become more user - friendly for typical non-tech - savvy @entity7 consumers			2
meanwhile , more @entity7 consumers are buying smartphones that can run apps for @entity178 calling services			2
by late 2012 or early 2013 , over half of the cell phones in use in the @entity7 will probably be smartphones			2
also , many of the remaining feature phones on the @entity7 market are becoming considerably " smarter , " with greater capabilities to handle more advanced internet - based services -- perhaps even @entity178 calling			2
@entity64 text messaging also has ample competition from the various popular internet - based instant messaging services such as @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 and more			0
@entity216 is another @entity64 alternative popular users of @entity216 phones			0
but the catch with alternative instant messaging services is that each one is a closed system			0
for instance , you ca n't directly send an instant message to @entity216 from @entity215			0
while instant messaging remains such a fragmented communication landscape , @entity64 ( which bridges all phone types and carrier networks ) retains a significant advantage			0
you can use that one mobile tool to communicate with whoever you want , as long as you have their cell phone number , and they do n't need to be logged in to a site or service at that time to receive your message			0
confusion for users still , @entity9 's research hints that the standard @entity7 wireless telephony market might be starting a long - term decline			1
it 's conceivable that @entity7 wireless carriers may eventually shift to mainly selling data , rather than telephony			0
this could mean that someday , standard cell phone calls and text messages might be sold as special add - on services , perhaps handled by separate divisions or companies for extra fees			1
what might that mean for mobile phone users ? probably a lot more confusion and frustration while the shift sorts out			0
it would take a few years at least before a communication system based mostly on the @entity171 and wireless data becomes as coherent and simple as the national telephone system most @entity7 grew up with			0
consumers may eventually see cost savings or service improvements associated with more freedom to choose how they make voice calls or send text messages , but this probably would n't be an easy change for most people to make			1
the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity278 .			0

new @entity9 study says 31 % of @entity7 adults prefer text messages
study : 4 % of cell owners do not make or receive any voice calls on an average day
rate of texting for 18 - to 24 - year - olds is more than double figure for 25 - to 34 - year - olds
