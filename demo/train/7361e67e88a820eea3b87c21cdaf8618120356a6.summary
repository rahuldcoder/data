with just two weeks before the health care exchanges open and the @entity3 really kicks in , the only thing that 's clear about the law is that @entity4 are totally confused about what it does			1
two polls released this week paint a dismal picture for those of us who consider it our job to explain what health care reform means to the public			1
the first , from the @entity16 and @entity17 , showed that almost 70 % of people do n't understand what @entity3 is or that they understand only a part of it			1
while 31 % thought it was a good idea , 44 % thought it was a bad one			0
the remaining 25 % were n't sure			0
when the poll specifically looked at the uninsured -- which @entity3 is specifically designed to help -- more than three - quarters of them said they did n't understand how the law would affect them			1
another poll , from the @entity31 and @entity32 , found that 53 % of @entity4 disapprove of @entity3 , compared with 42 % who approve			1
in this poll , though , only a third said they had little or no understanding of how the law would affect them			0
almost half of people thought that health exchanges would not be available in their state			1
while @entity3 is complicated , our understanding of it does n't have to be so			1
this is what @entity3 will do : most @entity4 already get health insurance from their jobs , @entity52 , @entity53 or the @entity54			1
the vast majority of those people will continue to do so			2
but starting in 2014 , people without health insurance will get insured in one of two ways			1
if they are very poor -- making less than 133 % of the poverty line -- then they will get @entity52 through the expansion of the program			0
that is , if their state has opted to participate in the program			0
if their state has not , then they may continue to be uninsured			0
the rest of the people without health insurance will go to the exchanges to get it			1
there , they can choose from plans with different levels of co-payments and deductibles , according to how much they want to spend			0
if they make less than 400 % of the poverty line , they will get a tax credit or subsidy to help with the cost			0
no one can be denied health insurance anymore , and no one can be charged more for being sick			1
all the plans are from private insurance , and they 're going to compete for your business			2
complete coverage : health care in @entity4 there are other bells and whistles , but that 's @entity3 in a nutshell			1
if you ask me , i think @entity3 will do more good than harm			1
many uninsured @entity4 are unable to get insurance in the market as it exists today , especially if they have chronic conditions			1
those who can afford to often pay a fortune for it			0
@entity3 is a solution to these problems			2
while a relatively small number of people will see their rates go up , they 're mostly young , healthy people making more than 400 % of the poverty line			2
the vast majority -- more than 90 % of people getting their insurance in the exchanges -- will get subsidies to make their insurance more affordable			1
plus , now everyone , even if they 're young and healthy at the moment , will be protected if they or a member of their family gets sick or when they grow old			2
there are places you can go right now to get more information			0
for instance , you can visit www.healthcare.gov			0
at that website , by answering a few questions , you can see what options will be available to you starting october 1			2
after that date , you will be taken to your state 's exchange , where you will be able to get actual information about plans and sign up for them			2
coverage will start january 1			0
originally , @entity3 was expected to come with more than half a billion dollars to be spent on outreach and education efforts about the exchanges			1
this money was supposed to be used to help people understand how @entity3 was supposed to work for everyone			1
but the @entity151 - led @entity150 cut the whole implementation budget			0
when @entity155 secretary @entity154 was further forced to move what little money remained in the pr budget into the @entity157 ( which was also cut ) , sen. @entity158 , one of the main architects of @entity3 , got upset			2
he remarked that the law was complicated and that we would get a " train wreck			0
" many leapt on this comment and proclaimed that even @entity158 thought the law was a mess			0
but that 's not what he said			2
he meant that if people did n't understand how it worked , then it would be a mess			2
at the moment , his prediction could still come true			0
the latest polls show that , as he feared , too few people understand how @entity3 functions			1
but there 's still time			0
it will take a lot of outreach and a lot of elbow grease , but supporters of the law believe they are up to the task			0
october 1 is approaching fast .			0

polls indicate that many @entity4 are very confused about what @entity3 is
