@entity0 -- congressional republicans tore into the @entity4 administration over the economic stimulus plan wednesday , arguing that the @entity6 is mishandling the distribution of the money while overstating the ability of the package to create jobs			1
president @entity4 says his administration would not want to change its approach to the stimulus plan			1
they criticized the @entity6 for referring to the number of " jobs created or saved " by the $ 787 billion package -- a metric , they claimed , that is impossible to verify			1
the @entity22 defended the plan , arguing that every federal dollar spent has , by definition , helped to ease the pain of the worst economic crisis since the @entity28			1
the @entity30 and @entity31 leaders traded their arguments during a contentious hearing before the @entity34			1
" in selling the stimulus package , the administration promised the @entity40 people that [ the ] legislation would create or save 3.5 million jobs and prevent the @entity40 unemployment rate from rising above 8 percent , " said rep. @entity35 , @entity36			2
" i believe that the discredited keynesian theory behind the effort is misguided , and i am convinced that it wo n't work , " said @entity35 , referring to the theories of economist @entity45			0
" unfortunately , recent economic data has validated my opposition			2
" the economy has shed 3.4 million jobs over the past six months , according to the @entity53			2
the unemployment rate rose for the ninth straight month in june , climbing to 9.5 percent and hitting a 26 - year high			0
" from the moment he was elected , the president has put the economy front and center , " countered @entity56 , deputy director of the @entity22			1
" we are slowing the economic freefall [ and ] the recovery act is an important part of that effort			2
... it 's a work in progress , but it 's steady progress			2
" @entity56 said the reported loss of 467,000 jobs in june was disappointing , but it nevertheless represented an improvement from the 691,000 jobs lost on average in the first three months of the year			0
republicans also criticized the use of stimulus funds to extend unemployment insurance			2
that kind of spending , while beneficial in some ways , does not " dollar for dollar , create or save a job , " rep. @entity79 , @entity80 , said			0
" i do n't see how you can say that , " @entity56 replied			0
" we believe that any dollar spent in the federal system will create or save a job , because what 's going on is we are putting dollars into people 's pockets to spur demand			1
" congressional democrats offered mixed reviews , arguing that the package was necessary , but improvements could be made in its implementation			0
" frankly , there is good news and bad news , " said the committee 's chairman , rep. @entity102 , @entity105 - @entity104			0
" the good news is that money is flowing from the federal government to the states at a faster rate than the @entity114 predicted at the beginning of this year			0
" the bad news , he said , is a @entity119 finding of " significant shortcomings in the targeting and tracking of recovery act spending			0
" stimulus money should be primarily directed toward economically distressed areas , @entity102 said , but states vary substantially as to what constitutes such an area			0
although many leading republicans say the stimulus plan has been a waste of money , some economists -- like @entity131 winner and @entity133 columnist @entity132 -- have argued the original measure was too small			0
vice president @entity139 said sunday that the administration " misread how bad the economy was , " but he told @entity141 's " @entity140 " that the pace of the stimulus program would be increasing			1
speaking on @entity147 's " @entity146 , " @entity4 on tuesday said " rather than say ' misread , ' we had incomplete information			1
" he also told @entity141 's " @entity150 " that " there 's nothing that we would have done differently			0
" we needed a stimulus and we needed a substantial stimulus , " he said			0
@entity31 leaders in @entity156 are now kicking around the idea of another stimulus			1
@entity6 majority leader @entity159 said tuesday he would consider supporting a second economic stimulus bill , but added that people need to give the package that passed in february more time to work			1
the president said he 's not taking the idea off the table , and one of his top economic advisers has already called for one			1
republicans , however , have accused the @entity6 of not getting its story straight			1
" they said the stimulus was necessary to jumpstart the economy			2
yet now , with about a half million jobs lost every single month , they 've started to admit that they simply ' misread ' the economy			2
these were costly mistakes , and we ca n't take them back , " senate minority leader @entity175 said tuesday			0
despite a tough year for @entity30 , @entity30 strategists say the economy is part of the party 's road to recovery			1
" nothing has really galvanized the @entity30 more than the stimulus vote , " @entity30 strategist @entity184 said			1
" one thing that we 've seen is that the president 's popularity , while he 's still popular throughout the nation , really is taking hits in key states			0
" @entity1 's @entity194 and @entity195 contributed to this report .			0
