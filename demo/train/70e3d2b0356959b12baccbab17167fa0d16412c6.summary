-- the nation 's colleges have a serious rape problem			1
five percent of college women experience rape or attempted rape every year on campus			1
most universities are doing little to nothing about this			2
from 1998 to 2000 , i was an assistant dean of students at the @entity13			1
of the six universities where i have worked , the @entity13 stands out among them for not only the frequency of rape allegations but also for the unresponsiveness of administrators			1
this issue , which affects so many students , is finally coming into light , led by the excellent reporting of @entity23 in @entity24 , detailing an alleged , horrific gang rape in a @entity27 fraternity			1
only now is the university really doing anything about it , some two years later			0
its most recent action is to suspend all fraternities through jan. 9 , some 45 days or so			0
to an outsider this might seem like an admirable first step			0
in reality , it is a farce			0
suspending fraternities ' functions at this point essentially means that they are not able to have official parties during the week between @entity42 and final exams			0
fraternities are self - supporting houses off campus anyway , so who is to say they wo n't just have a social gathering in their houses and not call it a party ? the trouble runs deeper , though			0
recent interviews with university administrators show that they are highly reluctant to expel a student who commits rape ( watch this eye - opening video )			1
when i worked there , i was once asked to meet with a student who had been found responsible for sexual assault			2
he was instructed to read a book about sexual assault and then discuss it with me			0
that hardly seems like an adequate punishment			0
i also sat through sexual assault board hearings where clear cut cases of rape occurred and supported survivors when they found out that the perpetrator was found " not responsible			1
" in most cases i was aware of , male students were not found responsible			2
occasionally suspensions would occur ; those were , of course , temporary			0
during my tenure there , rape survivors would commonly tell me that they had wanted to file charges against their attacker but were told by administrators that their cases were more fit for mediation			1
it is unconscionable to mediate a felony			0
and in fact , the @entity87 for the @entity89 @entity88 ordered universities in 2011 to stop mediating rape cases			1
but the @entity87 does n't seem to have deterred @entity27 much			0
in a morally abhorrent move -- one i hope will be found illegal by the civil rights office during its investigation of the university 's handling of sexual assaults -- @entity27 actually offered complainants a process for an " informal resolution " that sounds just like a mediation process			2
it also theoretically allows the school to avoid publicly acknowledging a rape happened and ignores the threat to the safety of the community			2
men who are responsible for rape need expulsion , not just a chance to give an insincere apology to avoid serious consequences			1
let 's remember that while recent news makes the @entity13 seems more egregious than most institutions , a lot of students there are making a big difference -- men in the one in four chapter and women in the @entity127 organization			1
they are pushing hard to make a difference they are working hard to educate their fellow students about the reality of rape and how to prevent it , and we all need to support them			1
we also need to remember that ultimately , we do n't do a lot of good focusing on just one university			0
it is time to use research - based programs like @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 and bringing in the @entity143 to eradicate this problem			2
furthermore , we need universities to have adjudication processes that are accessible to and trusted by students			0
let 's all work together to create a culture that reliably prevents rape and punishes rapists .			2
