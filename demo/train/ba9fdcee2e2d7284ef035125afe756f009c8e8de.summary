-- more than 3,500 people have been infected by the ebola virus in @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 since the first documented cases in december , according to new figures released wednesday by the @entity9			1
more than 1,900 people have died			1
there is also a smaller , unrelated outbreak in @entity13 and at least one confirmed case in @entity15 , according to @entity9 director general dr. @entity16			1
she characterized the outbreak as a " global threat " and encouraged the international community to do more to combat it			1
@entity21 complimented the @entity22 for its " very strong support " through the @entity24			2
@entity24 director dr. @entity25 said the official numbers are lower than the actual number of cases , because families afraid of the stigma associated with @entity31 do not report sick loved ones			2
others are caring for patients in isolation			2
@entity25 characterized the outbreak as " spiraling out of control " tuesday in a conversation on @entity0 's " @entity39			2
" " what we 're seeing is a ... hugely fast increase in cases that 's harder and harder to manage , " he said			2
" the more we can get in there and tamp that down , the fewer cases we 'll have in the weeks and months to come			2
" dr. @entity47 , the senior @entity48 system coordinator for @entity31 , said that in observing the disease on the ground , he noticed that a number of the infections have spread between family members who are caring for the sick			2
they must care for those infected with @entity31 because there are not enough hospital beds , nor are there enough ambulances to transport people safely			1
if the patients do get to a health care facility , there is not a good system of infection control , nor is there enough protective equipment to go around			0
@entity47 said there is a desperate need for personnel to help on the ground as well as for nurses , doctors and ambulance drivers in @entity75			0
the area also needs money to fight the outbreak -- at least $ 600 million , by some estimates			0
the fact that airlines have stopped flying to the countries affected has kept people isolated and has inadvertently made the outbreak worse , making it harder for staff and supplies to make it there			1
new cases in @entity6 @entity6 's minister of health said there are three new confirmed cases of @entity31 in @entity94 , the country 's oil hub			0
the ministry believes other cases will be confirmed there shortly			0
@entity31 initially arrived in @entity6 through an infected air traveler			1
the passenger landed in @entity102 on july 20 and died five days later			1
one person who was put into quarantine after he came into contact with the passenger fled the city and sought treatment in @entity94			0
a doctor who treated him developed symptoms and died a little more than a week later			1
not knowing he was sick , the doctor treated other patients			0
he also came into contact with members of the community after family and friends visited to celebrate the birth of a baby and after members of his church visited him at the hospital			1
@entity6 health leaders are monitoring the health of more than 200 people who may have had contact with the doctor			1
about 60 more are considered to have had high - risk or very high - risk exposure			0
the other confirmed @entity6 cases now include the doctor 's spouse , who is also a doctor , and a patient at the hospital where the doctor was treated			1
staff members are being tested for @entity31			0
with the help of the @entity24 and the @entity9 , an isolation facility has been set up to handle additional @entity31 cases			1
civic unrest and security issues , coupled with the public 's fear of @entity31 , are among the concerns			0
the military has been called in to escort people to the clinic			2
more need for help dr. @entity151 , the international president of @entity152 , spoke at a special @entity48 briefing on wednesday , criticizing the international community 's " lethally inadequate " response to the global threat			1
the group , also known as @entity152 , has been on the ground fighting the outbreak since march			1
@entity151 made what her organization described as an " unprecedented call " for @entity48 members with the technology to intervene in a biological threat to do so immediately			0
" six months into the worst @entity31 epidemic in history , the world is losing the battle to contain it , " she said			0
" leaders are failing to come to grips with this transnational threat			0
the @entity9 announcement on august 8 that the epidemic constituted a ' public health emergency of international concern ' has not led to decisive action , and states have essentially joined a global coalition of inaction , " she said			1
" the clock is ticking , and @entity31 is winning , " @entity151 warned			0
" the time for meetings and planning is over			0
it is now time to act			0
every day of inaction means more deaths and the slow collapse of societies			0
" @entity190 patient gets better medical personnel have been particularly vulnerable in this @entity31 outbreak			1
@entity193 , a @entity190 volunteer nurse who cared for @entity31 patients in @entity5 , was the first @entity195 known to be infected			1
doctors flew him back to be treated in an isolation unit at the @entity198 in @entity199			0
he stayed there for 10 days of treatment that included the experimental drug @entity203 , which was also used to treat two @entity22 medical personnel last month who have since been released from the hospital			2
@entity193 's doctors released him from care on tuesday .			0

more than 3,500 people are infected , and more than 1,900 have died , @entity9 says
international response to " global crisis " inadequate , @entity152 says
