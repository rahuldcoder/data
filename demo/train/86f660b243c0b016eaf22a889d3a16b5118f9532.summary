@entity0 -- a divided federal appeals court on friday struck down @entity4 's controversial ban on consideration of race and gender in college admissions			1
the 2 - 1 panel at the 6th @entity10 concluded the voter - approved ban on " preferential treatment " at state colleges and universities was unconstitutional , and " alters @entity4 's political structure by impermissibly burdening racial minorities			1
" the issue is likely to renew the national , political and legal debate over affirmative action , which the @entity20 could be poised to resolve in the coming months			1
the affirmative action ban was passed five years ago in a referendum and was added to the state 's constitution , barring publicly funded centers of higher education from granting " preferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race , sex , color , ethnicity , or national origin			1
" that prompted a series of lawsuits and appeals from various groups			0
" the university is reviewing the possible implications of the court 's decision , and recognizes that there may be further legal steps as well , " @entity40 , a spokeswoman for the @entity41 , said friday			1
she would not speculate how or when the school would need to alter its policies in response to the court 's ruling			1
a state appeal to the @entity20 is almost certain , setting up a potentially heated election - year debate in 2012 over whether race and gender preferences are still a socially necessary step			1
the issue comes after the justices in 2003 ruled that while @entity4 universities could use race as a factor in choosing which students to admit , they could not make race the determining factor in deciding whether applicants are accepted			0
the appeals court has now said the @entity4 law violated the @entity71 's equal protection laws			2
" because less onerous avenues to effect political change remain open to those advocating consideration of non-racial factors in admissions decisions , @entity4 can not force those advocating for consideration of racial factors to go down a more arduous road than others without violating the @entity88 , " said judges @entity72 and @entity73 , both named to the bench by former president @entity76			0
in dissent , judge @entity89 said voters had a right to pass this kind of referendum , even though school officials ultimately make the individual admissions decisions			0
" having no direct or indirect influence on the bodies vested with authority to set admissions standards -- the faculty committees -- the people of @entity4 made a political change at the only level of government actually available to them as voters , " said @entity89			0
" the @entity4 electorate , therefore , as opposed to choosing a more complex structure for lawmaking , employed the one method available to exert electoral pressure on the mechanisms of government			0
" the current controversy was sparked by the earlier @entity20 decisions			0
in two cases from the @entity41 , the divided high court said the university 's law school could give preferential treatment to minorities -- as one factor in the admissions process -- but could not set quotas or use a point system			1
writing for the majority in the law school case , justice @entity125 said the @entity71 " does not prohibit the law school 's narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body			2
" the moderate - conservative @entity125 has since left the bench , replaced by the more right - leaning justice @entity136 , who could prove the decisive vote if the current case reaches the @entity20			1
the referendum effort was led by @entity140 , who was at the center of the high court case eight years ago			2
as a white student , she was put on the waiting list for undergraduate admission to the state 's largest university			0
she eventually attended another school , and became the lead plaintiff in a subsequent reverse discrimination lawsuit			0
she ultimately prevailed at the @entity20 -- long after she had graduated -- and then began a public campaign to end racial preferences in admissions			0
efforts over decades to create a diverse classroom have been controversial			0
the famous @entity159 high court ruling in 1954 ended segregation of public schools , but sparked nationwide protests and disobedience by states who initially refused to integrate			2
in 1978 in the so - called @entity168 case , the justices said universities have a compelling state interest in promoting diversity that allows for the use of affirmative action			1
that issue involved a reverse discrimination claim by a white man denied admission to law school			0
and the high court in 2007 struck down public school choice plans in @entity181 and @entity182 , concluding race could not be a factor in the assignment of children			2
those school districts had sought to use raced - based criteria to achieve diversity			2
the issue in recent years is whether and when affirmative action programs -- while constitutionally permissible now -- would eventually have to be phased out as the goal of obtaining diversity is met			1
@entity125 in her 2003 decision predicted , " the court expects that 25 years from now , the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today			2
" the justices could be asked to decide whether @entity4 's current policy meets that legal and social test			0
the current case is @entity203 to defend @entity204 , integration , and @entity206 of the @entity41 ( 08 - 1387 ) .			1

the court concludes in a 2 - 1 ruling that the voter - approved ban is unconstitutional
the case is likely to renew a national debate over affirmative action
the @entity41 is reviewing the implications of the ruling , a spokeswoman says
