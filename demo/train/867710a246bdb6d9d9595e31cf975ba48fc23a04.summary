president @entity1 's endgame in @entity2 is now clear -- and the @entity3 has only a few days to act			1
on thursday , the @entity2 parliament voted 78 - 0 to hold a referendum on march 16			1
the main question will ask whether voters want the region to secede from @entity9 and become part of @entity11			2
previously , a referendum had been scheduled for march 30 on the less politically charged question of whether @entity2 should have greater autonomy within @entity9			2
if , as expected , a majority endorses secession , the story will change overnight from one about @entity11 's unprovoked military invasion to one about a minority 's right to self - determination			1
that is the @entity23 's plan			0
@entity28 leaders , already having trouble agreeing on a response to naked aggression , will find it much harder to oppose the popular will of the @entity2 people			2
at that point , risky actions to force @entity2 back into @entity9 will become difficult for @entity3 politicians to explain to their own domestic voters			2
the legal status of the planned referendum is more than murky			0
@entity9 acting president @entity38 has called it a " farce " and a " crime against the nation			0
" but , for democratic politicians -- and the societies they represent -- going against a majority vote is never easy			0
if @entity11 can change the subject in this way , @entity2 secession will become an established fact			1
@entity1 , who assured journalists on tuesday that @entity11 did not mean to annex @entity2 , will then be able to claim that he was " forced to yield to the will of the people			1
" with just a few days to turn the situation around , temporizing needs to stop			2
allowing @entity11 " more time " at this point , as some @entity28 leaders have proposed , is exactly what the @entity3 should not do			2
that @entity11 's @entity2 clients have moved the referendum date forward suggests nervousness in @entity62 -- and a recognition that time is of the essence			1
in the remaining time before march 16 , the @entity3 must convince both the @entity23 - connected @entity11 elite and the population of @entity2 that the region 's secession to @entity11 would be a mistake			1
direct threats are counterproductive , but clearly and calmly articulating the consequences of such a move can produce results			0
first , all the @entity75 states plus the @entity76 should make absolutely clear that they will not recognize the results of a referendum held while armed bands of " self - defense forces " roam @entity2			1
any decision to secede that results from such a referendum will be considered illegitimate			0
to increase @entity62 's isolation , it is worth exploring whether a large majority would support a resolution in the @entity88 -- of course , @entity11 would veto in the @entity90 -- reasserting the inviolability of borders in this case			1
second , the @entity75 and @entity76 should announce that economic relations would be frozen between the @entity3 and a @entity2 in legal limbo following secession			1
in part , this freeze would be enforced by the markets themselves			0
@entity2 's tourism industry would have to forget about attracting @entity3 visitors to the region 's beaches			1
international investors would demand huge risk premiums			0
but @entity3 restrictions on investment and trade with @entity2 could amplify the effect			2
the region 's agricultural produce could be banned from @entity28 and @entity9 markets			0
@entity114 must be helped to understand the choice they face : between becoming another @entity116 -- a failed statelet on intravenous drip from @entity62 -- or a flourishing region within the new , broader @entity28			0
the @entity75 should quickly earmark some portion of the 11 billion euros already promised to @entity9 for projects to develop @entity2 's economy if it remains @entity9			1
third , the @entity76 should work out a set of restrictions to place on @entity11 banks and corporations that do business in a @entity2 that has illegally seceded			1
as economist @entity130 has pointed out , existing rules against money laundering could be enforced more rigorously against various @entity11 entities			2
all of this needs to be done rapidly			0
while @entity133 has reacted quickly as the crisis unfolded , the @entity75 has suffered from its chronic lack of central decision - making authority			2
the next few days constitute a test			0
if @entity140 can not forge a strong , common position in time , then management of future crises will simply revert to the foreign ministries of @entity143 , @entity144 , and @entity145 , with the @entity75 's foreign policy role narrowed to coordinating long - term policies			1
while spelling out the costs that threaten the @entity2 population and the @entity11 political elite , @entity3 leaders must continue to devise " off - ramps " to outcomes that @entity1 could conceivably accept , but that , nevertheless , will not be seen as rewarding aggression			1
the @entity3 can call for a significant increase in @entity2 's political autonomy within @entity9 , negotiated with @entity157			1
@entity76 and @entity28 leaders should also speak out far more audibly in favor of minority language and cultural rights			0
they should have responded with outrage when the @entity163 , @entity9 's parliament , canceled the status of @entity11 as an official language and should now praise the promised veto of this law			1
it may still be possible to prevent the illegal annexation of @entity2			0
@entity1 is sensitive to the danger of splits within his political elite			0
the @entity3 must show him that he has underestimated the extent of political isolation and economic disruption that annexation would cause			0
it must work on winning the hearts and minds of the @entity2 population			0
the clock is ticking .			0

@entity183 : only a few days are left to stop the @entity2 *breakaway*
he says if @entity2 votes to *rejoin* @entity11 , that will greatly *strengthen* @entity1 's position
@entity76 and @entity75 need to apply economic pressure , make the case for a " no " vote , he says
@entity183 : @entity2 must see the choice is between *prosperity* and *stagnation*
