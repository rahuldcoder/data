-- it 's an unreal scene , like one from a horror film			2
here 's how @entity5 editor @entity4 described @entity7 's botched execution on tuesday of convicted killer @entity8 : 6:28 p.m. fifty milligrams of midazolam have been injected into each of @entity8 's arms to start the process , an attempt to sedate him before the second and third drugs are administered to stop the breathing and the heart			1
@entity8 has spent the past several minutes blinking and occasionally pursing his lips			0
... 6:37 p.m. the inmate 's body starts writhing and bucking and it looks like he 's trying to get up			0
both arms are strapped down and several straps secure his body to the gurney			0
he utters another unintelligible statement			0
defense attorney @entity27 is quietly crying in the observation area			0
6:38 p.m. @entity8 is grimacing , grunting and lifting his head and shoulders entirely up from the gurney			0
he begins rolling his head from side to side			0
he again mumbles something we ca n't understand , except for the word " man			2
" he lifts his head and shoulders off the gurney several times , as if he 's trying to sit up			0
he appears to be in pain			0
state officials reportedly were unsure how much of the second and third drugs that were supposed to kill @entity8 were actually injected into his body			2
while the third was being administered , @entity8 's vein " exploded , " @entity48 director @entity47 told reporters			0
he called the execution off			2
then the inmate , @entity47 told the media , died of an apparent heart attack at 7:06 p.m. perhaps some supporters of the death penalty find comfort in the fact that death by lethal injection is supposed to be painless -- more sterile than a firing squad , more clinical than the electric chair			1
for those people , perhaps , @entity7 's botched execution will be a wake - up call -- a realization that all executions , regardless of method , are cruel and not especially unusual in parts of the @entity71			1
but in @entity7 -- where both the firing squad and the chair are still statutory alternatives to the needle , if other methods were to be deemed unconstitutional by the courts -- method and morality do n't seem to matter much			1
this is the state -- the state where i grew up , by the way , and where i once worked as a newspaper reporter -- that has the highest per capita rate of executions in the country			1
nationally , support for the death penalty has declined from a high of 80 % in the 1990s to only 60 % now , according to @entity91			1
states such as @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 recently have abolished this abhorrent practice			0
it 's unclear if public opinion in @entity7 mirrors the national trend , statistically , but anecdotal evidence suggests the state supports , if not celebrates , state - sponsored death			1
" give them a bonus ! " one commenter wrote on @entity105 's website , apparently referring to the executioner or state officials			2
" i hope that man was in more pain than anyone ever imagined possible , " a woman from @entity7 wrote on @entity115 , echoing a sentiment i saw repeated			1
not everyone reacted this way , to be sure			0
but an outsider could be forgiven for seeing politicians in the state who support these unethical policies as death - hungry and vengeful			1
history would support that view as well			0
it was @entity7 , after all , in 1977 , that was the first state to authorize death by lethal injection			1
that decision was made , in part , because @entity7 was " facing the expensive prospect of fixing the state 's broken electric chair , " and lethal injections were cheaper , according to @entity134			1
it was @entity7 , in 1988 , that lost an argument before the @entity71 @entity140 that it should be able to execute a man who was convicted of murder at age 15			1
and it was @entity7 , just this year , that executed a 38 - year - old man , @entity145 , whose last words , just a moment before his death , were , " i feel my whole body burning			1
" yet , the state proceeded with @entity8 's execution this week			1
and it did so , according to @entity153 , using " dosages never before tried in @entity71 executions			2
" @entity7 gov. @entity156 was forced to show some sense when she ordered a stay of a second execution -- of convicted child rapist and murderer @entity161 -- that was scheduled to occur after @entity8 's on tuesday			1
that a state was going to execute two men in one night drew international curiosity and condemnation			2
it rattled some feathers in @entity7 , as there were protesters at the @entity171			2
but the governor and many residents were unmoved			0
no one would dispute that @entity8 's crime was unthinkably heinous : he was convicted of shooting 19 - year - old @entity176 before watching his accomplice bury her alive			0
but that does n't excuse the state from ordering his death , especially in this way			1
both @entity8 and @entity161 's sentences had been contested in court , with attorneys for the inmates arguing that the state can not withhold the exact source of the drugs it planned to use for the executions			2
a political circus ensued , and the court , in the view of @entity194 , a fellow at the @entity195 , " caved in to the political pressure			0
" @entity197 @entity196 wrote , in agreement with the court , that @entity8 and @entity161 had no right to know the source of the chemicals			0
" ... ( @entity206 ) f they were being hanged , they would have no right to know whether it be cotton or nylon rope ; or if they were being executed by firing squad , they would have no right to know whether it be by @entity214 or @entity215 ammunition , " he wrote , according to news reports			0
states have been scrambling to come up with drugs they can use to kill people since some drug makers stopped selling them for such purposes			0
@entity156 has called for an investigation into the botched execution			1
as part of that , she should make the source of @entity7 's drugs known			2
but @entity7 seems to be a place hell - bent on secrecy			2
near the end of the @entity5 editor 's journal of events , @entity4 writes that " blinds are lowered " and reporters were not allowed to see what happened in the final moments of @entity8 's life			0
" reporters exchange shocked glances , " she wrote at 6:39 p.m. " nothing like this has happened at an execution any of us has witnessed since 1990 , when the state resumed executions using lethal injection			1
" reporters were escorted to a white van outside the state penitentiary in @entity251 , @entity7 , which is commonly known as " @entity252 " they were told to leave their state - issued pens , @entity4 wrote			1
one could find hope in that moment -- could think that the state realizes that if witnesses saw what happened after the curtain fell , they would be shocked into action			0
that seems like a plausible explanation , but i still have my doubts			0
the death penalty is on its way out in @entity71			1
but it 's got a cold grip on @entity7 .			1
