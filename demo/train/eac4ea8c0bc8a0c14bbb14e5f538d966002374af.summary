almost two years ago , @entity0 launched its @entity1 with the goal of reducing sodium content by 10 % to 15 %			1
the city 's @entity4 worked with 206 restaurants , first evaluating their menus for sodium content and then helping them choose ingredients and develop recipes with less sodium			1
one way found to reduce sodium was for restaurants to cut the use of commercially prepared sauces and instead make their own			1
after nine months , the initiative analyzed two popular dishes from 20 participating restaurants to see what changed			0
the result ? a 20 % reduction in sodium , more than the project 's goal			0
it 's one thing to choose how much salt to add to your food when you eat			0
it 's another to live with decisions made by those who prepare your food before it makes it to the table			2
it 's not a question of just putting down the salt shaker			0
the vast majority of sodium consumed in the @entity42 comes from processed and restaurant foods			1
@entity42 eat out , on average , almost five times a week , and restaurant foods make up a surprisingly high percentage of sodium in the @entity42 diet			1
on average , food from fast - food restaurants contains about 1,850 milligrams of sodium per 1,000 calories and food from sit - down restaurants has nearly 2,100 milligrams per 1,000 calories			1
many restaurant meals have twice that many calories or more			0
toddler meals swimming in salt @entity42 dietary guidelines recommend limiting sodium to less than 2,300 milligrams a day -- and about six in 10 adults should further limit sodium to 1,500 milligrams a day			2
excess sodium can lead to high blood pressure , a major contributor to heart disease and stroke			0
an article published thursday by scientists at the @entity70 , " from menu to mouth : opportunities for @entity76 in @entity77 , " offers strategies that reduce sodium in restaurant food			1
restaurants can provide nutrition information at the point of purchase to give consumers the option to make healthier choices			0
they can also create group purchasing organizations to save on bulk purchases of lower - sodium ingredients			2
health departments can make dietitians available to assist restaurants with nutrition support			0
it all boils down to : reduce , replace , reformulate			0
when restaurants rethink how they prepare food and the ingredients they use , the healthy choice becomes the easy one for the customer			1
the story in @entity0 shows it can be done			2
the @entity70 collaborates with the food industry to reduce sodium in the food supply and provides technical assistance for this important work			1
we monitor programs to see what 's working in sodium reduction as well as broader blood pressure control initiatives through @entity111 , the national public - private effort to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes over the next five years			2
and we share that information through papers such as the one published thursday			0
reducing sodium in restaurant and prepared foods is n't about reducing choice -- just the opposite			1
by reducing sodium in the foods you buy , companies put control into your hands			2
after all , it 's easy to add salt if you want to , but not to take it out if it 's there .			0
