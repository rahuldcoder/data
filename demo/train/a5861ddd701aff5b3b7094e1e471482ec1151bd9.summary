@entity1 it 'll be difficult for @entity1 to celebrate with music and showmanship after last week 's twin terrorist attacks on the weekly newspaper @entity6 and a kosher supermarket			1
the violent events left at least 17 dead			0
for the brand new @entity11 -- scheduled to open this week -- the show must go on , even when the city surrounding still reels from the violence			1
amid unprecedented displays of unity and defiance in the wake of the attacks , the @entity11 aims to celebrate those who lost their lives , dedicating its debut concerts to the victims			1
rising in the northeast of @entity1 like a shimmering metallic starship , the new venue 's opening is intended as a historic moment for the city and performance groups who will call it home			1
controversy has beset the building , designed by architect @entity34			2
it 's gone over budget , was still having its stainless steel and aluminum outer shell installed a week before the opening and has been criticized for its location			1
it is in the @entity44 quarter in the 19th arrondissement , a stone 's throw from the @entity48 -- @entity1 ' ring road			1
against a backdrop of turbulent times , the people behind the venue will be hoping for positive reviews to cement its reputation			2
architectural misfits eight years in the making , the starkly modern building is unlike most other structures in @entity1 , but it manages to fit into the already eclectic architecture in the surrounding @entity61			1
other buildings here , including a science museum and the @entity65 concert hall , feature similarly un-parisian architecture -- a group of misfits that have found refuge together			2
speaking before last week 's events , @entity70 's director @entity69 spoke of his excitement about the new philharmonic			2
" it 's not every day that someone will build you a brand new concert hall of these dimensions , " he said			1
a grammy - award winning conductor , @entity69 will be directing the @entity70 's first shows , which start wednesday			2
they feature @entity84 artists and composers , including a world - premiere composition by @entity87			0
" like all new things there is a bit of anxiety and apprehension and a bit of unknown actually , " he said , admitting that his orchestra had n't yet practiced on the stage , which was still under construction the week before the gala events			0
the orchestra currently plays at the smaller @entity100 , in the chic eighth arrondissement , but @entity69 is thrilled about the move			0
" it 's sort of unbelievable that this actually going to happen , " he said			0
although nearly three times the initial budget , the 386 million euro project has drawn criticism over funding disputes			0
some also worry that the neighborhood will alienate older patrons in the west of @entity1 , though others say it 'll attract a younger , less affluent audience , including those from nearby suburbs			1
@entity84 minister of culture and communication @entity116 has defended the @entity11 , saying the hall will be the envy of orchestra directors worldwide			1
" no @entity125 capital will have a hall like this with such acoustic quality or capacity , " she told @entity123 radio in december			2
the main concert hall has 2,400 seats , making it one of the largest of its kind in @entity125			1
retractable portions of seating will allow up to 3,650 people on special occasions			0
it features modern , sleek , almost organic interiors that are a far cry from the gilded walls and red fabrics that line more traditional orchestra venues like the @entity144			0
with seats surrounding the stage , the design offers a closer experience with the music			0
sound experts from @entity151 and @entity152 have ensured @entity154 acoustics in the main auditorium , the most important thing for the orchestra			0
" but it 's not an exact science so we are keeping our fingers crossed that the acoustic gods smile on us , " @entity69 says			0
gentrifying district in addition to the @entity11 's bar , cafe , five public rehearsal rooms and an 1,800 - square - meter educational center , its @entity164 features a new temporary exhibition space to complement a permanent collection			1
the first show will feature works centered on @entity175 , featuring costumes , photos and other mementos from the performer 's personal life			0
there 'll also be a strong family and educational component , with weekend family events and workshops allowing more interaction than that found currently in @entity1 's big name halls			1
free recitals and concerts will run alongside paid events			0
the @entity11 's location , in the @entity61 , is also home to the @entity194 , as well as the @entity164 , a site well known by music enthusiasts			1
since 1995 the center has hosted exhibits and concerts for @entity200			0
the addition of the new building , however , will bring additional cultural offerings to a slowly gentrifying district , including @entity205 just across the beltway , where companies like @entity208 have recently opened ateliers			0
by orienting itself toward these up and coming suburbs , the @entity11 potentially opens itself to new audiences			2
but whether or not younger , suburbanite crowds will fill the venue remains to be seen			0
prices for ticketed shows start at 10 euros on the @entity11 's website and books are open for the 2015 season			1
more details on the season can be found here at the @entity11 's season calendar			1
@entity1 ; 221 avenue @entity223 , 75019 @entity224 , @entity84 ; +33 1 44 84 44 84 ; @entity225 @entity226 is a freelance journalist based in @entity1 .			2

@entity11 's debut concerts are dedicated to the victims of the recent attacks in @entity1
new venue has *courted* controversy through its budget , *delays* and suburban location
with 2,400 seats , it 'll be one of the largest concert halls of its kind in @entity125
