-- considered one of modern @entity5 's founding fathers , @entity2 's first president @entity1 has spent much of his life fighting some of @entity5 's toughest battles			1
from his struggles against the racism and oppression of colonial rule in the 1950s to the fight against @entity14 today , it 's been an eventful life for @entity2 's former leader			1
@entity1 's rise to prominence started in the early 1950s , a time of growing political unrest in the region			1
@entity23 movements across @entity5 were gaining momentum and activists , becoming ever more defiant , were demanding the end of colonialism and the right to self government			2
in @entity30 -- soon to become @entity2 -- @entity1 was in the midst of the struggles , fighting against a repressive and racist regime , he explained to @entity0			1
" we were going to defy unjust laws , conditions of slavery more or less ... there was segregation of the worst form			0
" he continued : " schools for whites , schools for blacks , hospitals for whites , few hospitals for blacks			0
and so it went on			0
everywhere there was racial discrimination			0
" but his fight for independence was not without consequence and in 1959 @entity1 was arrested and jailed for ten months			1
for @entity1 , prison was an inevitable part of the fight for freedom			1
" i think i succeeded in the end but it meant going into prison defying unjust laws , being arrested by the police , beaten up , thrown into prison , " he said			0
" you come out and you still continue and we did this and in the end thank @entity72 we succeeded			0
" after his release in january 1960 @entity1 became leader of the newly formed @entity75 ( @entity75 ) and in 1964 after elections and much political wrangling , @entity2 was finally granted independence from the @entity79 with @entity1 as its president			1
it was a presidency which was to last 27 years , but under one party rule			1
a decision highly criticized , with many accusing @entity1 of presiding over a dictatorship			2
but @entity1 has remained defiant about his decision to form a one - party state , telling @entity0 : " my colleagues and i decided we 're going to go into one party			1
the reason for that , there was no way , no way at all in which we could have fought and defeated colonialism all around us , with so many parties in @entity2 at that time			2
he continued : " no , i have never been a dictator			0
it was a bargain with the people			0
but even then i knew it was not the best thing to do			0
but in that situation it was the only way out			0
" in 1990 @entity1 finally legalized opposition parties setting the stage for free , multi-party elections , which took place in 1991			2
the elections saw the end of @entity1 's leadership with @entity112 from the @entity113 coming to power			1
now , after 20 years away from the political spotlight , @entity1 is still campaigning			1
his major battle today is the fight against hiv / aids , a disease running rampant throughout his country , affecting one in eight @entity2			1
it 's a cause close to the former leader 's heart and one which has affected him personally			2
" my own child , one of them , died of @entity14			2
a brilliant boy , " @entity1 told @entity0			2
" he died of @entity14 but that 's not the reason why i am fighting @entity14			1
i fight @entity14 because it 's a killer disease , destroys the human race in all fields			1
" it 's this constant will to fight that leaves @entity1 positive about the future of his country and @entity5			1
this despite the many challenges ahead			0
" i 'm very hopeful that things will come right , " he said to @entity0			0
" because you see there was a time when a leader went wrong and they became an oppressor ... but today things have begun to change			0
" the struggle , the condemnation is quite often within the continent of @entity5			0
it 's a good beginning towards a realization of what , democracy is right in this world , east , west , north , south			2
so i 'm confident that we have begun to grow			0
