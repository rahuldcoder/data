-- last time around , humanity 's savior came in the form of a human messiah			0
this time , if technology analysts , bankers and venture capitalists are to be believed , it will take the form of a handheld computer otherwise known as a smartphone			0
that 's right , the new @entity12 announced wednesday is already being credited with saving the @entity15 economy			1
according to @entity18 , sales of the new device should boost our nation 's gdp by as much as 0.5 % in the fourth quarter of this year alone			2
that 's not a misprint , but half a percent of the nation 's economic activity , or $ 3.2 billion			0
it 's hard to know whether such proclamations - even if true - say as much about the power of smartphones as they do about the weakness of the rest of the economy			1
in either case , however , i ca n't help but fear yet another hyper - inflated bubble in the making			1
maybe smartphones make us ' @entity39 ' ? first off , most of the projected $ 3.2 billion wo n't be from consumers to @entity43 , but from wireless carriers subsidizing their subscriber 's purchases in return for contract extensions			1
that 's not really " growth " the way we used to define it in economics class			2
but that does n't stop us from mistaking wireless as a pure growth industry , and far too many from placing their bets accordingly			2
working as i do in @entity61 's @entity60 , it 's hard not to bump into an @entity12 app builder or investor everywhere i go			1
labs , incubators and angel investing groups are quite focused - some might argue obsessed - with launching the next monster @entity12 hit , and then selling before it crashes			1
top - ranked @entity12 app draw something , for example , peaked at around 50 million downloads this spring			1
this was just in time for its developer to be bought by @entity77 for $ 200 million , and then start its descent into obscurity the very next day			0
even the students at the graduate digital programs where i teach have shifted from building for computer or the web to developing for the @entity12			1
like garage bands of yesterday , they toil away in the hope of getting the next big hit			2
yes , we 've been here before			0
first time , for me anyway , was the cd - rom craze			2
@entity94 interactivity , new authoring tools and seemingly infinite storage space led many media publishers to believe that cd - roms would be to the digital era what books were to that of text			2
they obsolesced themselves as a viable format ( mostly by being slow and boring ) even before networking speeds made disks irrelevant			0
the dotcom boom appeared just as infinite to those in the know			0
while @entity114 has been left standing , @entity112 and @entity113 crashed as quickly as they rose			0
the vast majority of online retailers surprised the @entity119 analysts betting on them			0
social media was supposed to solve that problem for the tech industry and @entity123 alike , but climaxed in the ipo of @entity125 , a disappointment so far - reaching it has dragged dozens of social media companies along with it , and sent investors and entrepreneurs looking for greener pastures			1
the choreography of an @entity43 event like wireless handheld devices and the apps running on them			0
everywhere i turn , every conference i attend , every magazine story i read seems to be based on one aspect of these technologies or another			0
everyone is hard at work on an @entity12 app that lists , maps , or socializes some data set in some new visual way			1
pictures over text , text over maps , restaurants close to subways , or apps showing subways with @entity155 to download more apps			0
do n't get me wrong : wireless is big , and these devices are here to stay , at least until we get comfortable with apps being embedded in objects and technology being implanted in our bodies			2
and while the opportunity for corporations to make billions on these apps may be overstated , we may still see a new peer - to - peer marketplace emerge between independent developers and the users of their bounty of applications			1
but the extent to which entrepreneurs , developers , and even columns like this one depend on @entity43 and the rest of the wireless computing industry for new grist far exceeds their true impact or potential			0
so go , get an @entity12			1
but find something or someone else to save you			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			1

@entity186 : release of new @entity12 is being *touted* as a big boost to the economy
he says such *pronouncements* make him think more of a hyper - inflated bubble in the making
he says much of growth comes from carriers subsidizing subscribers ' purchases
@entity186 : developers , investors obsessed with @entity12 . like other tech booms , it too will pass
