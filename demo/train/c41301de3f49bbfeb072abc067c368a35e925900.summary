she also washed her hands excessively , avoided sick people and barely ate because she feared food poisoning			2
@entity12 has also felt that she needed to wash her hands more than most people , to the point that her classmates picked on her			2
she would see words spelled out in her head -- " like reading a book " -- telling her to do things , like hitting a girl in second grade who taunted her for obsessing over hand washing			2
@entity1 , 17 , and mystery , 10 , have different symptoms , but they both have had feelings of needing to act in certain ways that are out of the ordinary , as well as intense fears			2

and they may not necessarily realize they 're not acting normally			0
" for the most part , adults realize that these symptoms do n't make any sense			0
they get that this does n't make a lot of sense , " @entity62 said			0
" kids do n't necessarily have that perspective			1
" a standard behavioral treatment for @entity32 is called exposure therapy , a kind of cognitive behavioral therapy aimed at decreasing anxiety associated with particular phenomena			1
for children , this often involves naming ocd as the " bully or " monster " and chasing it away , @entity62 said			1
this helps kids deal with their scary , unwanted thoughts			1

@entity1 's mother , @entity123 , had never heard of @entity32 before @entity1 came to her and told her about these feelings			1

a turning point for @entity1 was the @entity31 conference in 2006 in @entity140			0
@entity1 really did n't want to go , but her mother coaxed her into attending			0
it was there that she met other young people with @entity32 whose symptoms had gotten better -- something @entity1 did n't know was possible			1
" before i went to the conference , i did n't think it was possible to go from doing eight to 10 hours of rituals a day , to being symptom - free and living a normal life , " she said			0
she liked the conference so much that she went back the following year , when it was in @entity152 , and met two girls who continue to be her best friends to this day			0
" we understand each other , and we know we do n't have to hide anything from each other			0
we do n't judge each other for what 's going on in our lives			0
we 're always there for each other , " she said			0
@entity1 is a varsity swimmer and swims year - round , and when her @entity32 got tough , she felt relief from stress in general by diving into her passion for the sport			1
these days , @entity1 is a senior in high school and managing her @entity32 better than earlier in her childhood , although there are still ups and downs			1
sometimes , she 'll have months or years without symptoms , but this fall as she stressed about applying to college , she caught herself tapping her hand in specific numbers and having other unwanted thoughts			0
she still takes medication and goes to therapy every two to three months			1
mystery 's @entity32 journey began earlier , around age 5			1
she started having more outbursts , and the excessive hand washing and checking of locks on doors began			0
the writing in her head bothered her to the point that she could n't sleep			0
at night she feared that some kind of " mean animal " or monster was outside her window and had vivid nightmares , from which she awoke crying			0
other kids would pick on her when she would suggest that they also wash their hands before meals in the school lunchroom			1
based on informal surveys , many @entity32 kids tend to report feeling bullied and say @entity32 interferes with schoolwork , @entity62			1
therapy and medication have also helped @entity35 , who also has @entity207 's syndrome , meaning she also has trouble with social interactions and repetitive behaviors			2
she has gone through several combinations of treatments before finding a mix that felt right : an antipsychotic , the antidepressant duloxetine , the antipsychotic ziprasidone and the @entity218 drug guanfacine			0
i do n't have to wash my hands as much , because i 'm not really worried , " she said			0
with her therapist , she has also talked about making friends and gets bullied less , although " kids will be kids , " she says			2
