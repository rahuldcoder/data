-- as the first female judge to be appointed to @entity4 's high court , @entity1 is a trailblazer in her home country , paving the way for other women fighting for equality and justice			1
her 11 - year tenure at the high court was marked by the landmark 2006 case where @entity4 's @entity14 took the government to court over the right to live and hunt in the central @entity19 game reserve			1
in what is the southern @entity23 country 's longest and most expensive trial to date , @entity20 ruled that the @entity14 should be allowed to return to their ancestral lands			1
the case attracted widespread international attention and came to define @entity20 's career at the high court that ended in 2009			1
today , 53 - year - old @entity20 is a partner in her own law firm , a successful author and a prominent activist championing women 's rights			1
it 's all a far cry from growing up in a dusty rural village on the outskirts of @entity36 , @entity4 's capital			1
" i was born into a @entity4 where there was no tar road , no telephone			2
i think i saw my first refrigerator when i was a teenager , " remembers @entity20 , 53			2
" i grew up in a @entity4 where you had to hold water on your head and hold firewood as well			2
" despite the tough conditions and the initial objections of her family , @entity20 decided to pursue a career in law following advice from one of her teachers			1
after high school , she went to @entity58 to continue her studies before spending two years at @entity60 , @entity61 , where she found herself one of very few women in the law faculty			2
while making her first professional steps , @entity20 says she quickly came across an innate gender inequality built into law			1
" when you start to practice you realize how just the language of the law is so male , the culture of the law is so male , " she says			0
" you 're beginning to think , ' i do n't think it should be like this , i have a right to be here , i 've earned the right to be here and therefore this whole environment should be about me as well			0

but her reputation shot up in the early 1990s when she was the plaintiff in a groundbreaking case that dealt with citizenship rights through the mothers of newborns			0
" i was married to a non-citizen , and therefore my children were born to a @entity4 and an @entity93 , " she explains			2
" i was shocked to realize that in terms of the law my children were not @entity4 citizens because i was not male			1
" @entity20 thought the law was unfair and embarked on a mission to make it unconstitutional			1
the long - running legal battle attracted huge media coverage in @entity4			0
" suddenly i was being unpatriotic by bringing this case , i was being un-cultural , i was influenced by my foreign training , i was not behaving like a normal nice wife , " she says describing some of the comments directed toward her during the trial			0
" there were times where i was really energized , feeling i 'm going to win this battle ; there were times where i really felt so despondent ; there were times when i felt so angry , and i think i cried many more times during that period than any other time in my life			0
" but after five long years , @entity20 won the case , managing not only to change the law on citizenship and give men and women equal rights , but also influencing other laws			1
" after that the government actually commissioned a study to say what other laws discriminate against women and over a period of time those began to be changed , " she says			0
" i think now in terms of the legislative framework , the legal framework , we have a fairly decent equality provisions across the board			0
" @entity20 also co-founded the @entity138 to raise awareness about @entity140 in @entity141 , an initiative aiming to empower women in the region			2
" we did studies on child support and how culture influences the law on child support ; we looked at access to property by women ; we looked at widowhood and widowhood ceremonies , the extent to which they strengthen and you know undermine women , " she says			0
" it was really a chance to actually talk within southern @entity23			0
" but when she 's not fighting legal battles or promoting human rights , @entity20 is busy spending her time penning novels , exploring issues such as gender conflicts , the contradictions between traditional and western values and the aids pandemic			1
and now , after spending last decades studying the law and fighting for a more equal legal system , @entity20 says her next target is to join the political arena -- a move that will enable her to put forward her own ideas			1

" i would love a plan to join politics and to run for a political office as a member of parliament and therefore join the legislature			0
" determined and ambitious , @entity20 admits that running for public office wo n't be the end of her impressive life journey			0
" nothing ends until you 're dead , " she says			0
" so no , it will not end there			0
