@entity0 -- @entity4 , a @entity3 nurse 's aide who had contracted @entity6 after caring for a patient with the deadly disease , is now free of the virus , @entity3 's @entity2 said sunday			1
" today i 'm very happy , because it can be said that @entity4 has overcome this illness , " @entity11 's husband , @entity10 , said in a video statement released by a family spokeswoman			1
two earlier tests showed that @entity6 levels in the health worker were almost nil , and a third test came back negative			1
" the last two measurements were in ' background ' levels , and there is no significant statistical difference with negative results , " @entity20 , an expert on viruses , said in a phone interview , in @entity23 , with @entity1			0
" if for three times , throughout one week , you are background , background , background , in practical terms it means you do n't have the virus			2
" officials have previously said that the amount of the ebola virus in @entity11 's blood had decreased dramatically from the time she was rushed to the hospital two weeks ago , but @entity20 explained just how close to negative she has already come , even before the latest test sample on sunday			1
why some survive @entity6 , some do n't @entity11 has recovered enough to produce antibodies , he said			2
" it means she 's making her own protection , so any virus fooling around probably will be destroyed or neutralized , " said @entity20 , who 's been attending the near - daily meetings of the government 's special committee on @entity6 , a panel of medical and scientific experts convened to deal with the crisis			1
even though @entity11 received the negative result for the ebola virus on this third key test in a week , she will surely remain in hospital for days , possibly a few weeks , in order to recover , @entity20 said			1
she has received two main treatments in her battle against @entity6 , for which there is still no vaccine			2
the first was an iv drip with the antibodies of an @entity6 survivor -- a @entity71 nun who survived the disease in @entity73			0
and @entity11 also received an experimental anti-viral drug , favipiravir , @entity20 said			0
@entity3 imported another experimental drug , @entity76 , but could only get an older version -- not the newest version , whose stocks have run low globally -- and @entity11 's doctors decided not to use it on her , @entity20 said			1
to fight her lung problems while also battling @entity6 , the doctors administered anti-inflammatory drugs to ease her respiratory problems , even while unsure how that treatment might affect the @entity89 measures , @entity20 said			0
