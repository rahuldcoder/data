-- when i think of @entity2 approaching 80 , i think about the women of my generation , growing up at the end of the @entity6			1
we internalized a lot of stereotypes of what it meant to be a woman in those days			1
until @entity2 changed the rules			1
my earliest memories of gender inequity involve " @entity16			2
" i was 7 years old when i asked my mother , " why does @entity18 act like @entity20 's boss ? " my mother laughed and said it was " just a joke			2
" i did n't get it			2
the unspoken rules were evident in grade school , when teachers signaled their high expectations for boys but not girls			2
and when i looked at the larger world , i found that men were the leaders of countries , companies , churches , schools -- although the teachers were mostly women			2
i felt different , really different , but mostly i kept quiet about it until i was 17			0
in the summer of 1972 i bought the first issue of @entity39 magazine , a vivid image of @entity41 bursting from its cover			1
@entity2 , a founding editor , examined the myth that " women voters ca n't be trusted			1
" @entity45 wrote about the insidious ways that women compete with other women			0
a piece titled " @entity50 " helped women demystify the workings of their car , complete with a detailed diagram of an auto engine			2
an etiquette column headlined " @entity60 " counseled , " anyone can hold doors for anyone else			0
it is only decent to see that it does n't slam behind you			2
" i used my babysitting money to subscribe			0
@entity2 's words rang in my head when i challenged the status quo for girls in high school			1
a faculty advisor for the @entity71 announced that the boys could run for president and treasurer and the girls for vice-president and secretary			0
like @entity2 , i came from a working - class family where you did n't question authority			1
my heart pounded as i argued for gender equality			2
i found my voice through @entity2 's			1
opinion : feminism is no longer a dirty word by the time i was in college , i was taking courses on sex roles and dressing like @entity91 : i streaked my straight blonde hair and topped off my outfit with aviator glasses			2
after college , life got more real			0
and so did the pressures to conform			0
" gender roles are policed , " @entity2 taught us			1
i went on to study psychology and learned the academic term for this policing : " coercion to the bio-social mean			0
" stray from the behavioral norms of your social group , and people -- men and women alike -- will conspire to push you back to the middle			0
in the workplace , such policing is clear when it involves discrimination			0
other times it is subtle , but it can be just as effective			0
be good , but not too good ; be strong , but not too strong ; be competent , but not too competent			0
cross those subtle lines and you 'll be branded with the " b " word : " bossy			0
" a recent article in the @entity122 put it this way : " women must live up to collective expectations of what makes a leader , while at the same time remaining true to gender expectations			1
" a year ago i led an executive education workshop for school principals aspiring to become superintendents			0
i asked how many of them had been accused of being bossy			0
nearly every woman raised her hand			2
i talked about society 's gendered perceptions of leadership			2
some participants welled with tears as they began to understand that sexism often masquerades as a hurtful personality attack			0
5 reasons why we love @entity2 in a 1995 speech to graduating seniors at her alma mater , @entity146 , @entity2 analyzed this phenomenon with her typical anthropological incisiveness : " some of us women have been successfully socialized to feel that women ca n't be leaders , and vice versa			1
" when we have children , people double down on the pressure for women to conform			0
often this comes in the form of never - ending questions about balancing work and family			0
would n't you rather be at home with your baby ? do n't you worry about the effects of child care ? why are you working so hard ? once again , @entity2 had the answer			1
in 1984 , she observed , " i have yet to hear a man ask for advice on how to combine marriage and a career			0
" women pressure other women about work and family , a phenomenon that has continued well past the " mommy wars " of the 1980s			0
i am still troubled by @entity181 's 2012 @entity180 essay , " why women still ca n't have it all			1
" in the most widely cited @entity180 piece of all time , @entity181 wrote about the challenges of balancing a demanding career and raising children			0
if @entity2 had been her editor , we might have seen a different headline : " @entity192 n't have it all ... and how to raise everyone 's consciousness about it			1
" one of my favorite expressions of @entity2 's is , " the truth will set you free , but first it will piss you off			1
" the truth is that we need to continue the work of identifying how gender biases operate in our everyday lives			1
we are not living in a post-gendered world or a post-feminist world			1
leaders of countries , companies , churches and schools are still mostly men			0
" a feminist is anyone who recognizes the equality and full humanity of women and men , " @entity2 taught us			1
the work of feminism goes on because @entity2 's voice continues to resonate across the world			1
the woman whose words changed the trajectory of my life at 17 continues to speak to me and millions more			1
" whatever the question , " @entity2 said recently , " women are part of the answer			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity228 .			1

@entity228 : @entity2 changed rules on what it mean to be a woman
in *70* 's @entity2 *co-founded* @entity39 magazine to upend sexist status quo . @entity228 was hooked
@entity2 helped her find voice to seek posts reserved for males , resist ' policed ' gender roles
@entity228 : @entity2 's work still resonant , necessary ; we do n't live in post-gendered world
