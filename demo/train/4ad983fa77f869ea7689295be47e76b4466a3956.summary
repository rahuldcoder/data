-- it took @entity2 only one try to become one of " @entity6 's " best hosts			1
on the january 18 episode , the rapper dusted off his acting skills -- honed on " @entity10 : the @entity15 " -- and seamlessly brought " snl " back from its hiatus with its newest cast member , @entity13			1
@entity13 was recently hired after the @entity17 sketch comedy show was criticized for its noticeable lack of @entity21 - @entity20 women , and made her debut on january 18			1
behind the scenes , " @entity6 " has also added two new african - american women writers , @entity25 and @entity26			0
on saturday , viewers were trying to figure out how " @entity6 " would address its highly publicized hire -- would the show again poke fun at itself by making her take on everyone from the first lady to @entity35 © to @entity36 in one sketch , as @entity38 did when she hosted last fall , or would it slowly introduce her with just one or two scenes ? in the end , " snl " went with a third option : it used @entity13 liberally throughout the show as a supporting player , but her debut was virtually overshadowed by the night 's host , @entity2			1
in addition to performing , the 27 - year - old artist participated in nearly every sketch and nailed them , from his opening monologue that recalled his bar mitzvah ... ... to his impersonation of comedian @entity53 , and his spoof of colleagues @entity56 and @entity57 in " before they were @entity59			2
" in fact , the one person who won the episode more than @entity2 was @entity63 and her impersonation of @entity65 in the cold open : we were n't the only ones who thought so			0
" ( @entity74 ) ive credit to host and musical guest @entity2 for shifting through characters as if he 'd always belonged on the late - night sketch show , " the @entity70 said in a review			0
" @entity2 showed he had a deft comedic hand on saturday			0
" the @entity79 's @entity78 was also pleasantly surprised , saying in a review that @entity2 reminded him of @entity81 from last season : " an energetic host that 's been given so - so material that he 's able to elevate -- to a point			2
" and the fact that " snl " fully integrated @entity13 into the episode ( versus trying to break her out as a more prominent star ) also meant there was more time for @entity2 , @entity91 noted , " and @entity2 was really , really great , " particularly in the " before they were @entity59 " sketch .			0
