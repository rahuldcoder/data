@entity0 , @entity1 -- after dumping intense rain and bringing strong winds to @entity1 and @entity6 on saturday , @entity3 picked up steam -- and promised to pick up strength -- as it spun toward @entity9			1
the storm left at least two people dead in the impoverished @entity13 nation of @entity1 , pounding camps where hundreds of thousands of people live in tents			1
as the @entity1 government and outside agencies continued to assess the damage , the focus surrounding @entity3 increasingly turned toward @entity9 , much like the storm itself			1
@entity3 was roughly 65 miles northeast of @entity24 , @entity6 , and 340 miles east - southeast of @entity25 by late saturday , moving at about 17 mph , the @entity23 said			1
the storm system is expected to gain strength and become a hurricane by early monday as it moves past the @entity29 and into the @entity30			2
after barreling north -- affecting @entity9 's western coast along the way -- the storm is expected to pack 100 mph sustained winds by the time it makes landfall sometime late tuesday afternoon or early evening on the @entity38 , likely near @entity39 , according to forecasters			1
that progression prompted @entity43 officials in @entity44 to effectively push back monday 's scheduled start of the @entity46 one day , hoping the move will make it safer and easier for delegates to attend			1
tropical storm conditions could first be felt there by late sunday , and by late monday afternoon and early evening , @entity3 's eye should be west of the coastal city			1
@entity9 's governor , @entity54 , insisted saturday that his state will be ready for whatever happens			1
" this is a state that has dealt with hurricanes forever , " he told reporters saturday in @entity58			2
" we are a state that we know we have to get prepared for hurricanes			0
" as preparations continue , authorities in @entity1 spent saturday assessing @entity3 's aftermath			1
the country is still recovering from a devastating earthquake that struck more than two years ago , and its challenges are compounded by the fact it is led by a relatively new government with limited resources			2
all that said , the top @entity75 humanitarian official in the nation praised the initial response efforts			1
" so far , i think we 're faring reasonably well in our response , " @entity78 told @entity2 on saturday afternoon , referring to the efforts led by the @entity1 government and assisted by @entity75 agencies and non-governmental organizations			1
@entity1 radio reported that the worst damage was in the country 's southeast			1
heavy rain and strong winds persisting into the morning hours caused visible damage to trees and houses in the city of @entity96 , on @entity1 's southern coast , and knocked out power			1
as many as 1,500 of the city 's residents took refuge in a school serving as a shelter			2
@entity96 mayor @entity104 confirmed at least one death on the outskirts of his city , voicing fears that more deaths will be reported			0
a 10 - year - old girl also died when a wall fell on her house in @entity115 , near @entity0 , the country 's civil protection agency said			2
at the @entity117 camp , where 8,000 @entity1 live in makeshift shelters , fallen trees and flooding damaged hundreds of tents			2
almost no one had evacuated the camp before the storm , and authorities were searching the camp tent by tent looking for victims			2
at another camp , @entity129 , half the tents were blown away , according to an official statement on the radio			0
@entity1 's national electricity supplier at one point said that 30 out of the country 's 32 electricity grids were down			1
@entity138 was operating on generator power after losing electricity , just before midnight , said @entity141 of the @entity142 , which provides services at the hospital			0
the nation 's main airport closed for a time , but had reopened by late saturday afternoon , according to @entity147 , operations manager in @entity1 for the @entity149 humanitarian organization @entity148			1
in @entity0 , people were evacuated to areas behind the presidential palace and also to a stadium			0
the storm dumped up to a foot of rain around @entity157 -- the island shared by @entity1 and the @entity159 -- with up to 20 inches in some locales			1
@entity78 pointed out the prospect of another humanitarian disaster would have been much worse right after the 2010 earthquake , when about 1.5 million people were living in about 1,500 makeshift camps			0
today , he said that figure is closer to 400,000			0
but @entity1 may not be out of the woods yet , with the possibility of even more heavy rain causing a host of problems along the coast and in populated areas downhill from mountains			2
" we could possibly get another 10 inches and , should that happen , we 'd be very concerned about flooding in the low - lying areas and those places adjacent to the sea , " @entity78 said			0
water levels along the @entity182 in @entity0 are already " at their breaking point , " and more rain could cause them to overflow their banks and flood surrounding areas , @entity147 said			0
in @entity96 , residents fear that large amounts of rainfall may cause mudslides , runoff and severe flooding as it did several years ago			0
" i 'm very worried about the water coming off the mountains and that the city fills up like a sink , " said @entity104 , the city 's mayor			0
@entity3 threatens destruction , cholera after hitting @entity1 , @entity3 skirted eastern and central @entity6			1
@entity6 officials reported some storm surge and flooding from rain in the far eastern part of the country , and about 200 people were said to be in shelters in the town of @entity213			2
but thus far no major damage or injuries were reported			0
strong wind gusts were also felt in @entity217			0
after passing @entity6 and getting back out over open water , @entity3 is forecast to gain strength over the next 48 hours , the hurricane center reported			2
the @entity29 , @entity221 and the state 's west coast , from @entity224 south to @entity225 , are under a hurricane warning			0
and a hurricane watch , first issued early saturday , continued overnight for @entity9 's east coast from @entity229 south to @entity225			2
a watch means hurricane conditions are possible , and a warning means that hurricane conditions are expected			0
a tropical storm warning , meanwhile , was in effect overnight saturday for @entity6 's eastern provinces , most of the @entity240 , @entity234 and @entity235 , the east coast of @entity9 from @entity237 south to @entity225 and the west coast of @entity9 from @entity239 south to @entity224 -- an area that includes @entity44			1
" it has been a fortunate seven years since @entity249 hit @entity9 , " @entity23 director @entity244 said , referring to the last hurricane to make landfall in the state			0
" the luck is going to run out at some point			0
" @entity54 declared a state of emergency for his state , which he said is " standard protocol " to ensure a well - coordinated response with local , state and federal agencies			0
big storms like these are nothing to @entity262 , the governor pointed out , and people are already working to get ahead of this one			0
in @entity25 , the southernmost point in the @entity267 and likely the first part of the @entity9 to be hit by @entity3 , mayor @entity265 told @entity2 on saturday that " we 're ready ( and ) we 're confident that it 's not going to be really bad			1
" many storefront windows were boarded up , while hotels were largely vacant even though no orders or recommendations for evacuations had been issued			0
some in @entity25 , though , suggested they were ready and eager to ride out the storm			1
" we came down here to have a good time , we 're not going to let a hurricane get in the way , " @entity282 , a tourist from @entity283 who is visiting the @entity29			0
" i am a big believer in lifetime experiences , ( and ) i 've heard about hurricane parties , so we 're going to have some fun with it			0
" opinion : @entity290 : what about @entity1 ? @entity2 's @entity292 , @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 , @entity296 , @entity297 and @entity298 and journalist @entity299 contributed to this report .			1
