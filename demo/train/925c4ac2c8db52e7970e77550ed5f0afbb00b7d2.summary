the congressional spending bill agreed to on tuesday night blocks @entity2 lawmakers from using federal or local funds to implement november 's popularly passed referendum to legalize marijuana in the district			1
the legislation , according to a release from @entity13 rep. @entity13 , chairman of the @entity14 , " prohibits both federal and local funds from being used to implement a referendum legalizing recreational marijuana use in the district			2
" the language in the bill -- found on page 660 of the 1,603 page document -- is word - for - word what @entity20 rep. @entity20 of @entity21 proposed earlier in the year			2
" none of the funds contained in this act may be used to enact or carry out any law , rule or regulation to legalize or otherwise reduce penalties associated with the possession , use , or distribution of any schedule i substance under the @entity37 or any tetrhydrocannabinols derivative for recreational purposes , " reads the bill			0
@entity2 marijuana activists ' worst fears were realized on tuesday night with the agreed upon language			1
earlier in the day , activists worried that @entity44 would thwart november 's popular vote to legalize pot in the district			1
" @entity52 language sucks , " @entity48 , chair of the @entity49 , said after the language was released			1
" only the @entity53 can step up and do something or presidential veto			0
otherwise our election has just been overturned and we will take it to the streets			0
" in response to the @entity44 ' decision , pro-marijuana groups are prepared to protest wednesday night			2
although the proposal needs to pass the @entity52 and @entity53 and get signed into law by the president , it appears unlikely the @entity66 will risk shutting down the government to remove the marijuana language			1
senate majority leader @entity69 , who believes that @entity2 should be able to do what it wants , admitted to reporters earlier today that " if they put it in there , it 's going to be hard to take it out			2
" and in announcing the deal , rep. @entity79 , @entity81 - @entity80 , said that although she " strongly oppose [ s ] several policy riders included in this final agreement ... i am pleased @entity66 were able to eliminate many of the most damaging provisions			0
" by moving to stop legalization efforts in @entity2 , @entity44 will have trumped the over 70 percent of district residents who voted to legalize marijuana in november			1
@entity44 , under @entity2 's @entity90 charter , is able to veto every law approved by either @entity2 voters or government			1
in the past , this power has been used to block everything from abortion spending to needle exchange			0
during the 2011 budget negotiations , president @entity98 reportedly used the district 's law of paying for low - income women 's abortions as a bargaining chip with @entity52 speaker @entity105			1
" @entity105 , i will give you @entity2 abortion			0
i am not happy about it , " @entity98 said , according to the @entity109			0
" this was always a possibility but i think it is very , very disturbing that @entity66 have given this away , " said @entity110 , policy manager for the @entity111 , a group that lobbied for the @entity2 law			2
" this is really one of the final acts of @entity66 leadership before @entity121 control both sides and for them to give this away , it just seems to very tone deaf			0
" the @entity49 , the group who introduced and passed the legalization ballot initiative , also blamed congressional @entity66 for blocking the legislation			2
" this is a big issue and if you are going to overturn an election , you are going to demoralize young @entity66 across the country , " said @entity48 said			0
@entity2 mayor - elect @entity132 has not yet commented on the possibility of @entity44 addressing the district 's marijuana law			1
but her spokesman , @entity136 , before the language came out on tuesday that @entity132 " would hope that @entity44 would respect the will of the voters and reject any challenge to their rights			1
" with @entity44 blocking marijuana funding , expect many @entity2 residents to cry foul about what they calling living under the thump of @entity44			1
" this is nothing new , " said @entity146 , a longtime figure in @entity2 politics			0
" we are a colony			0
we are @entity152 's colony and anytime they want to screw around with us , they can do such things			0
" what 's more , while @entity44 is making decisions for the district , proponents of district autonomy were quick to point out that district residents still have no voting member of the @entity52 or @entity53 .			1
