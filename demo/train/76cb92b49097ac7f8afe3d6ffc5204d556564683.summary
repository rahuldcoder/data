-- solar energy in a suitcase is an invention saving lives around the world in places that lack reliable electricity			1
dr. @entity8 discovered several years ago that many women and babies were dying during childbirth simply because there was n't adequate light to treat them			1
so she and her husband came up with a portable solar energy kit to provide light and power when necessary			2
since 2009 , their nonprofit , @entity18 , has given out nearly 250 free kits to medical facilities in @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			1
" a lot of the clinics do n't have any electricity , " @entity8 said			2
" midwives use kerosene lanterns ; they may use candles ; they use their cell phones to deliver babies			2
" the " solar suitcase " was designed to help during childbirth , but one recently came in handy when there was a cholera outbreak in the @entity37			1
on his first day with the kit , a doctor from the @entity37 delivered a woman with twins			1
the very next day , there was an outbreak of cholera , a deadly bacterial disease			1
" every man , woman and child who came to his clinic over the next 30 days were treated day and night , " @entity8 said			0
" and he put 15 mats on the ground outside because so many people needed to be cared for and could n't fit in the clinic			0
" at night , @entity8 said , the doctor would take the solar suitcase outside and use it to tend to his patients and treat them with intravenous medications			0
" for the first time in the history of ( the doctor 's ) island , no one died of cholera , " @entity8 said			0
" he told us that in the past , 50 % of patients would die , and 80 % of those deaths would happen at night			0
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2013 @entity71 @entity8 says she cried when she heard the story , and she hopes her nonprofit can continue to help more people in need			1
" one of the things i do whenever i bring a solar suitcase to a clinic in another country is , i really let the health - care workers know that there are people on the other side of the world who care about them , " she said			1
" i say : ' when you use this suitcase and it 's late at night , do n't think that nobody 's caring about what you 're doing			0
you have sisters and brothers on the other side of the world that cared enough to actually contribute to this and to bring you light			0
i do n't want you to feel alone			0
