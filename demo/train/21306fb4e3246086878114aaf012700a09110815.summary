-- @entity1 may have missed out on the @entity3 world title yet again , but the @entity5 motorcycle star is determined to finish the 2012 season on a high note at one of his favorite tracks on sunday			1
the @entity11 rider smashed @entity13 's lap record at the @entity15 circuit in @entity16 on saturday to claim pole position for the final race			1
he clocked one minute 30.844 seconds near the end of the session to head off compatriot @entity21 , who clinched his second world title for @entity23 at the penultimate race in @entity25 last month			1
last year 's world champion @entity26 , who won at @entity27 , will complete the front row in his final race for @entity11 before retiring			1
" it was almost a perfect lap and i gave 100 % because i knew i would n't be able to improve any more as the tires were very good for the first lap and then the drop in grip was quite severe , " said @entity1 , who will finish second in the championship for the third time since stepping up to the elite class in 2006			2
the 27 - year - old has won five times at the circuit in @entity3 's three divisions			1
" i 'm very happy with the pole position and the new record because @entity13 's old record was done with qualifying tires			1
we had only one dry session to test the new asphalt , " he said			0
" we still have to decide on the tires for tomorrow because we have used only the soft compound , but it depends on the weather -- if it rains we will need to take what we learned yesterday			0
i really would like to win here and finish the season with a good race			0
" @entity26 , whose title defense was derailed by injury , has two wins and two second placings in @entity16 since his @entity3 debut in 2006 but the @entity25 is not comfortable with the track 's new surface			1
" qualifying did n't really go to plan , it was a pretty frustrating session			0
due to the miserable weather this weekend , we had a lot of work to do in a very short space of time , we did make some good progress but unfortunately we could n't find enough before the end of the session , " the 27 - year - old said after setting a time of 1:31.428			0
" there is a new surface here and we expected everything to be really good and smooth but in fact we 've found there are a lot of bumps on the circuit			0
hopefully the weather is dry tomorrow and we can take that extra step in warm - up			0
" @entity21 , who will be rejoined by @entity13 at @entity23 next year , has won six out of 17 races and finished runner - up 10 times -- with just one retirement			2
" it seems like it 's going to be very close tomorrow			0
@entity1 is very strong here , not only in the dry but also in the wet and it seems it could be wet for the race , " he said after clocking 1:31.195			2
" i tried my best for pole position with the last rear tire but i did n't expect the lap time from @entity1			2
" seven - time world champion @entity13 has not won at @entity16 since 2004 , and his hopes of a repeat seem slim after a poor final qualifying run for @entity106			1
the @entity107 , who has stood on the podium just twice in two years away from @entity23 , finished saturday 's session back in 11th -- more than two seconds slower than @entity1			0
he set the previous lap record of 1:31:002 in 2006 .			2
