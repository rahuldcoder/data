" we are mobilizing for a fight , " said @entity113 president @entity112			0
a federal task force led by vice president @entity117 -- which met with the @entity113 , gun control advocates and numerous other groups -- is set to deliver recommendations to president @entity121 on tuesday			1

" whether there will be action taken is another question			0
if experience is any guide , there will be far more bills introduced than enacted			0
