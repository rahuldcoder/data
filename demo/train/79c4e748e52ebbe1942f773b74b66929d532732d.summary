-- " release the models ! " the stage manager 's voice fills the backstage area , busy with hairstylists and makeup artists wielding the tools of their trade over a row of girls in front of brightly lit mirrors			1
" it 's time for a quick run - through			1
" it takes an extra moment for @entity17 to break free from her chair , where she is surrounded by three stylists trying to tame her long blonde hair into a " punky ballerina " bun			1
the head stylist is teasing sections of her natural hair while another tends to neon pink extensions woven into her ponytail			1
a third handles clips and brushes			1
it has n't been a good hair day for the 20 - year - old @entity34 model			1
it 's the second time today that her head has been pulled in a million directions , loaded down with gooey products and hairspray			1
but she refrains from pouting because it 's part of the job			1
anyway , modeling is n't her life -- not yet , at least			1
it 's just something she decided to try by taking a year off from university in @entity34 , where she 's studying computer science			1
she started exactly one year ago , making the rounds in @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 before arriving in @entity58 three weeks ago for @entity59			1
a " @entity63 's " influence on display at @entity62 " when you 're tall and thin , everyone says you should be a model , so i thought : try it for a year , " @entity17 said in accented @entity64 , which she learned in school and from television			1
" it 's been good			1
i decided to model because it was completely different			1
how would i know if i did n't try ? " she hit the ground running in @entity58 , averaging 15 castings a day and scoring not only a few shows during @entity62 but jobs for catalogs and ads campaigns while in town			1
she plans on returning to her parents ' home outside the @entity34 capital of @entity83 to resume school in october			2
@entity17 may not be the typical small - town girl trying to make it in the big city , but her story underscores the bigger picture in the post-supermodel era , when girls are cycled in and out with each season and only a rare few stick around to become bold - face names			1
but her agency has high hopes for her			2
lots of girls are tall , thin and beautiful , but @entity17 has an " x presence , " said @entity99 of @entity100 , which represents @entity17 in the @entity101			1
" our clients look for that classically beautiful girl that has a different edge to her , something that no one can define , " @entity99 said			2
" we loved the spirit in @entity110 's photographs , the connection she had with the camera			2
in her eyes , you just saw there was a sparkle there			2
when you look at her , you have a sense that this girl can be successful			2
" but @entity17 is simply living in the moment			1
and right now , it 's time for a quick practice walk on the runway			2
the stage manager yells again for the girls , and @entity17 joins the line of models near the backstage runway entrance			1
with their hair and makeup in various states of readiness , they look like a disheveled flock of flamingos stepping to the beat of singer / designer @entity139 , who is nowhere in sight even though the show bears the @entity144 rocker 's name and her brand 's imprint , @entity147			2
the collection , a swirling motif of skulls , rainbows , pleather and studs , is n't exactly @entity17 's speed , but she 's still excited to take part in this kind of production			1
it 's completely different from @entity161 's garden party - themed presentation sunday , in which @entity17 's prop was a badminton racket , or the @entity165 presentation earlier that day , which was staged in a 1,000 - square - foot studio in an office building			1
for that job , she wakes at 7 a.m. monday , showers and puts on just a bit of mascara and concealer			2
she takes a cab to the @entity174 , arriving at the 11th floor whitewashed studio about two hours before showtime			1
it 's not a runway show but a " presentation , " in which the models will be dressed and positioned on the showroom like living mannequins			2
for now , the corner studio with lots of natural light pouring through the windows is a backstage area for hair and makeup			2
eventually , it will transition into a showroom with music from a live violinist , creating an atmosphere reminiscent of an art gallery			2
@entity17 takes a seat , and a makeup artist gets to work on her face while a nail technician applies heated " nail shields " that behave like stickers			1
as she moves on to hair , the benches and makeup tables are removed , and risers are brought in to begin setting up the showroom			2
twenty minutes later , her hair is done , and the tables are pushed back to a wall			2
a curtain goes up , creating an impromptu changing area for the designer to dress the girls			2
she emerges in a set of light blue shorts , blazer and shell			2
" it 's not really my style , very businesswoman , " she says			2
" maybe in 10 years			0
" once the models are clothed , a set designer arranges them on the floor while stylists dart around with spray cans and makeup brushes , putting on the final touches			0
then , it 's time for the girls to stand in place for an hour as fashion editors and store buyers survey the collection			0
when a camera focuses on @entity17 , she narrows her eyes ever so slightly			1
about a half - hour in , she leaves the floor for the curtained changing area and returns in a tan calf - length skirt and lace cut - out halter top			0
she stands some more , occasionally shifting her weight to keep the circulation flowing			0
as the clock hits noon , some of the girls relax their rigid poses and wait for the cue to leave			0
@entity17 thought she would have a stretch of time for lunch -- modeling makes her hungry , she says -- but as she 's leaving the studio , her agency sends an e-mail letting her know that she has a fitting for @entity258 , so she heads downtown			1
on the ride over , she talks about this being her first time in the @entity101			0
she has noticed that fast food is really cheap , healthy food is expensive and everything seems to be labeled " organic			1
" she wishes she had more time to eat in restaurants and try new things but since she arrived in @entity58 , she 's only had two days off to explore			0
in the studio on @entity269 , she tries on two looks for the designer 's " @entity276 " presentation , which is part @entity273 , part activist , designer @entity267 says			0
@entity17 's childlike features and height make her ideal for the show 's cartoon - y look , @entity267 says			1
as she tries on two of the designer 's neoprene looks , a bright yellow dress and a blue coat , @entity267 squeals in delight			0
" when i was a little girl my favorite doll was named @entity110 and i carried her around with me everywhere , " the designer explains as @entity17 struts down the narrow path in between racks of clothing and accessories littering the floor			1
" @entity110 has come to life ! " @entity267 and her team agree that the yellow dress is too short for the 5 ' 11 model and settle on the blue coat			0
@entity17 bids them farewell and runs downstairs to head over to the @entity303 for @entity139 's show			1
the contrast from the morning 's gig could n't be more severe			0
the intimate austerity of the open studio has been replaced with a massive showroom of folding chairs surrounded by booths for @entity312 and @entity314 energy bars , with a bright white runway in the middle			0
getting her hair to cooperate and putting on her face leaves about 10 minutes to breathe before the show			0
on the way to the bathroom , she picks up a salted caramel chocolate from the @entity325			0
@entity139 eventually shows up about 30 minutes before showtime to thank the girls and pose for pictures			0
as they line up , she walks around adjusting their bows and belts and other small details			0
the show is over in 10 minutes , and @entity17 is already 30 minutes late for her next job in @entity336			1
she fills a plastic cup with vegetables before hustling outside to grab a cab to the @entity340 for a presentation by menswear designer and self - described " urban emperor " @entity344			0
again , the setting could n't be more different			0
she walks up a flight of stairs to the hotel bar , which has been transformed into backstage hair and makeup area			0
the constant loop of " @entity352 " and " girlfriend " has been replaced by @entity354 and @entity355 playing softly in the background			0
a woman is ironing pants where the waiter station would normally be ; models rest their hands on the marble - topped bar to get their nails done			0
she takes a seat on a plush stool of dark wood while two stylists set to work blowing out her hair to remove product			0
she picks at a plate of cheese in her lap while they pull her hair into a tight ponytail at the crown of her head and fashion it into a bun			0
the tip of her hair is pulled into an avant garde cowlick			0
a makeup artist hands her a cloth to remove her makeup while she waits for a seat at the bar			0
eventually , her face is transformed into a pale , white - lined canvas best summed up as extraterrestrial			0
there 's no private changing area here , so she quickly strips and changes into a black top and pants with its calves cut out			0
she 's paraded out with the rest of the models to a corridor and placed on a riser against a column			0
she stands there for an hour while an art house film plays and attendees in leather black shorts and vests take her picture			0
eventually , she moves to the stage in front of the film screen with other models who are growing impatient			0
finally , one of the models starts clapping , and the audience follows			0
the models seize the opportunity to step down and leave the corridor			0
it 's 11 p.m. now , and @entity17 is tired			1
modeling is exciting but exhausting , she says			1
will she return to modeling after she finishes school ? " it 's possible , " she says			1
" but maybe not for @entity62			0

@entity17 took a year off from *pursing* her computer science degree to try modeling
a typical day for a @entity425 lasts 12 hours , with no breaks for food
agencies grapple with trying to create a big name in post-supermodel era
