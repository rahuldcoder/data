@entity1 , @entity0 -- meet @entity3			0
the @entity4 is just 13 weeks old and was dumped by its owners			2
in the adjoining kennel eight boxer cross puppies have been similarly abandoned			0
@entity3 the border collie : one of the animals awaiting new owners at a dog re-homing center			1
@entity12 is also waiting for a new home as the owner of the bullmastiff cross moved into a flat which does not allow pets			2
these are just a few of the animals currently being cared for at a re-homing center in @entity1 run by the @entity21 , the largest dog charity in the @entity23			1
" our center is now full			0
we have more dogs coming into the center than going out			2
at this time last year , we had half as many dogs , " says manager @entity27			2
other dog shelters and re-homing centers across the country are also at bursting point as a result of an increase in requests for re-homing and a decrease in people wanting to take on the responsibility of looking after a dog			1
with insurance , food , grooming and toys , a dog 's life can come with a price tag of Â£ 15,000 ( $ 22,500 ) , according to the @entity21			0
and with millions of households tightening their belts as the credit crunch bites , some are opting give up their pets			0
the increase in requests for re-homing is attributed to the financial crisis			1
owners either have to move to dog - unfriendly accommodation or can no longer afford to care for the animal after losing their job			1
" moving as a result of the credit crunch is the number one factor for giving up a dog , " explains @entity27			0
" people also ring up to say they ca n't afford to look after their dog anymore , because they 've been made redundant			1
" on top of overcrowding , animal rescue charities face another problem ; they rely on charity donations and are likely to suffer in those terms			1
" the expected increase in unemployment and decrease of disposable income is going to affect the donations , " says @entity27			0
another concern for dog charities is that animals are given as @entity83 presents			1
unfortunately some of these dogs turn up at the re-homing center in the @entity86 as unwanted gifts			2
but dark times may be a good time to start looking after a dog , says @entity27 : " with the love and the care , the relationship that a dog can bring to you at a depressing time like this , is incredible			0
i have six dogs and certainly when coming home at night they put a smile on my face			0

dog re-homing centers in @entity23 at bursting point as owners dump their pets
*economic* crisis means many owners ca n't afford expense of caring for dogs
many dogs given as @entity83 presents end up with animal charities
charity donations to animal *welfare* groups also likely to suffer because of crisis
