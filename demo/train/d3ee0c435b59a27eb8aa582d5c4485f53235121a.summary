-- " to this day " had a very small beginning			2
the poem itself was written in 2009 after rereading a series of notebooks i had written in as a child			1
i 'm fortunate enough to have a grandmother who never throws anything away , and one day , she returned a series of journals i had kept			2
i did n't pay any attention to them at first			1
i wondered what possible value could come from revisiting what i had already managed to survive			2
one day , out of boredom , i picked up a journal and began reading it			1
i was amazed to discover that in midst of all the darkness surrounding my childhood , there was a still a young boy with a sense of humor			1
after quickly consuming all of the other texts , i realized that i had been completely neglecting a large chapter of my life simply because i wanted to be done with the pain that i had associated with it			2
watch @entity33 's @entity32 i wrote a series of pieces , all exploring my early life , and was not surprised to find that so many people were relating to the material			1
there was a tremendous sense of agony as i prepared to perform the poems for the first time			1
i remember wondering why i was willfully about to put myself through these experiences again			2
it has been such a rewarding journey to rediscover a part of myself that i thought i had long discarded			0
my band , @entity33 and the @entity48 , ended up rerecording " to this day " for our 2011 album @entity51			1
the poem quickly became a requested piece from our catalog at live performances , and each time there seemed to be a special silence from the audience			1
fans have often remarked that we were telling their story back to them with that piece			0
i get a lot of mail regarding poems that i 've written , but the letters i get in response to this piece are easily the most heartrending			0
there are people in the world whose endurance staggers me			0
there are stories that test our hearts			0
they stretch us out into empathy , and all we can do is feel for these strangers who in an instant feel like family			0
in 2012 , i lent my voice to a project developed by @entity81 studio for the @entity82 and their educate the @entity85 campaign			0
the team at @entity81 were great work partners , and they offered to lend me their services for a project down the road			0
it did n't take long to pick a project : " to this day " was a piece i was wanting to do something special with for a long time			1
@entity81 put together an animated video call out to other animators and the response we got was overwhelming			0
the team did an incredible job of threading the animations together to create the finished video			0
language fails me in my gratitude for everyone who helped bring this project to life			0
from " to this day " : ... if you ca n't see anything beautiful about yourself get a better mirror look a little closer stare a little longer because there 's something inside you that made you keep trying despite everyone who told you to quit you built a cast around your broken heart and signed it yourself you signed it " they were wrong " because maybe you did n't belong to a group or a click maybe they decided to pick you last for basketball or everything maybe you used to bring bruises and broken teeth to show and tell but never told because how can you hold your ground if everyone around you wants to bury you beneath it you have to believe that they were wrong they have to be wrong why else would we still be here ? we grew up learning to cheer on the underdog because we see ourselves in them we stem from a root planted in the belief that we are not what we were called we are not abandoned cars stalled out and sitting empty on a highway and if in some way we are do n't worry we only got out to walk and get gas we are graduating members from the class of f --- off we made it not the faded echoes of voices crying out names will never hurt me of course they did but our lives will only ever always continue to be a balancing act that has less to do with pain and more to do with beauty ... the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity33 .			1
