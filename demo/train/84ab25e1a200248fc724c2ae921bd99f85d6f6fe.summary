@entity0 , @entity1 -- a few years ago , during one of his lowest points , @entity3 decided to play a game of @entity8 roulette			1
he pointed the metal barrel of a gun at his head , he said , as one ominous click followed another			2
eventually -- inevitably -- the gun discharged			0
what followed was both improbable and lucky : the bullet sailed over @entity3 ' head and lodged into the wall behind him			1
i think about it all the time , " said @entity3 , 36 , wringing his hands as he recalled one of his two suicide attempts			1
" the way it happened , it clearly was n't my time ... it was n't my time to go			0
" @entity3 , a former running back and kick return specialist in the @entity28 , might look at that episode as something to forget -- except that the same dark thoughts , at times , still overwhelm him			1
in the 11 years since he retired from the @entity28 , @entity3 has dealt with serious cognitive issues : a memory that is feeble at best , crushing depression and rage he can neither understand nor predict			1
report : @entity39 's body exhumed for brain study @entity3 believes that innumerable head impacts during his six - year professional career -- and during the decades leading up to the pros -- explain his struggles			1
he said that he has tried , in vain , to get help from the league and the @entity48 , a union representing players			0
" i 've reached out and i 'm not getting too many calls back , " said @entity3			1
the game that changed everything @entity3 said @entity54 for him , cognitively , began in november 2001 , when he was tackled during a game between his team , the @entity56 , and the @entity57			1
at the tail end of that tackle , @entity3 ' neck bent so dramatically that the side of his head appeared , for a split second , to lie flat against his chest			1
at the same time , his head was being burrowed into the ground			2
after that hit , @entity3 was unconscious for several seconds			1
when he woke , his memory of who he was or what he had just been doing had vanished , he said			0
it is unlikely that his brain could have healed from such a traumatic injury , yet he played the following week			0
" players on the other team ... they were not even understanding why i was playing in that game ( the next week ) , " said @entity3			2
" when you have players from the rival team acting like they 're concerned , it must be something			0
" first @entity84 player diagnosed with @entity85 with recent @entity28 rules changes , that scenario is unheard of today			1
under the current protocol , if a concussion is even suspected , players are sidelined			0
but that was not the case in 2001			0
and , at the time , @entity3 said he felt he needed to play to keep his spot on the team -- and his income flowing			2
" it just seems like there 's an agenda and our well - being is n't a part of that , " said @entity3			1
" ( the @entity28 is ) changing all these rules and stuff to make it seem like they care but it 's not about changing the rules			1
" it 's about when something happens to your players and at the end of their career you need to take care of those who need to be taken care of			2
" @entity118 cognitive slope after that horrifying hit , @entity3 played for four more seasons			1
during that time , memory problems , along with persistent migraines , would nag him			0
by the time he retired , @entity3 said a more persistent pall hung over him			2
" everything was getting worse , " said @entity3			2
" my sleep was getting worse , my moods were getting worse			0
i 'd never been that guy to just be angry			0
i never showed that type of behavior , and it just got worse			0
" @entity129 , @entity3 ' cousin , said he has lately received troubling text messages from @entity131 , where he seems to be threatening harm			2
in one text , @entity129 said , @entity3 told him he was going to " kill " someone he was meeting with at the time			2
" @entity3 was such a mild - mannered person ( before ) , very quiet , very shy , " said @entity129 , who said @entity3 usually calms down after venting via text			1
" for him to go from that , being that shy individual , to an individual texting me that he 's about to hurt someone , that 's where the level of concern really elevates			0
" @entity146 : why i 'm donating my brain before now , @entity3 was understandably reluctant to reveal such intimate details of his emotional life			2
but he feels that he is on the brink of something terrible			0
he hears echoes of his own experience in the lives of former players like @entity156 , @entity157 , and his former teammate and friend , @entity160			0
all three committed suicide and were later diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( @entity85 ) , the dementia - like disease that is associated with repeat concussions			1
@entity3 believes that he , too , is suffering with @entity85 -- which is associated with the symptoms he has : memory loss , aggression and depression			1
" the depression and the rage , " said @entity3			1
" that 's what i notice most			0
" @entity3 ' self - diagnosis is -- at best -- a guess , since @entity85 can only be diagnosed after death			1
but as the behavioral and mental health issues associated with the disease become clearer , former players are emerging to reveal their suspicions the disease is taking hold			2
recently , @entity185 player @entity184 told @entity2 that he struggles with memory loss and wildly shifting moods , and that he suspects that @entity85 is the culprit			1
" i look in the mirror and i say , ' who are you ? ' " said @entity184 during an interview with @entity2 's @entity190			0
" ' what are you becoming ? ' " self - diagnoses among former athletes , and nonathletes with a history of traumatic brain injury , may reflect a simple desire to give a name to what ails them			0
realistically , there is more than one neuro - degenerative disease that could explain their symptoms -- not just @entity85			1
" the problem is , people are diagnosing @entity85 clinically all over the place , " said @entity208 , professor of neurology and neurosurgery at @entity211 , in a recent interview			2
" there is no framework to make that diagnosis while someone is alive			0
" desperate for help @entity3 found out last year that he is ineligible for the @entity28 's neuro - cognitive benefit , a program that could have provided him with financial help for living and medical expenses			1
he questions how someone who can not think straight , who can not remember what he was about to do or say from moment to moment , who has inexplicable rage , would not be eligible for help			0
seau had brain disease that comes from hits to head , @entity233 finds @entity28 spokesman @entity238 acknowledged that @entity3 has reached out to the organization for help , but that -- as of right now -- he is ineligible for disability programs to which he has applied			1
@entity238 provided documentation of @entity3 ' failure to establish test validity -- meaning his answers to a battery of questions did not prove neuro - cognitive problems			1
@entity3 has appealed the decision ; the results of his appeal will be revealed by @entity28 this month			1
" they want to help you ... when you 're already done , when you only remember what you did two seconds ago , " said @entity3			2
" i do n't want to get to that point before somebody wants to help me			0
just , you know , give me some help			0
" @entity48 spokesman @entity259 said that when players need help , in every case , the organization responds quickly to provide support			0
meanwhile , @entity3 said his symptoms are getting worse			2
" it 's hard to deal with , it 's a hard subject , just not knowing what 's wrong with you , " said @entity3			1
" not knowing why these things are happening			0
" your mind just goes crazy			0
and that 's just where i 'm at right now			0
