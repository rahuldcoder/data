-- if the @entity1 are the @entity2 of the @entity3 — a collection of slick all - stars for whom victory is more or less a given — then the " @entity8 " are the " @entity9			1
" they 're a motley crew of bickering , bumbling mercenaries driven by self - interest			2
they may band together in the end , but it 's rarely peaceful or pretty			0
the de facto leader of this assembly of intergalactic antiheroes is @entity21 , a cocky @entity22 ( i.e. , earthling ) who was hoovered up into space by a colossal spaceship when he was 8 and now introduces himself as '' @entity21 '' to the derisive laughter of his snarling alien foes			0
@entity30 shows @entity33 a seriously old - school ' @entity8 ' clip twenty - six years later , he 's grown into a swashbuckling fortune hunter with a maroon leather duster , a vintage @entity36 loaded with classic rock , and a roguish sweet tooth for extraterrestrial hotties			1
played with wily mischief by @entity41 , he 's like @entity43 's more excitable , less responsible nephew			1
joining @entity21 in @entity3 's fizzy franchise kickoff are the green - skinned assassin @entity47 ( @entity46 ) ; the mumbly mound of muscles @entity48 ( wrestler @entity49 , whose physique is its own special effect ) ; a rascally , foul - mouthed raccoon named @entity54 ( voiced by @entity55 ) ; and a walking tree creature called @entity57 , whose only words are '' i am @entity57 '' ( delivered through the gruff , grunting tonsils of @entity60 )			1
directed with an effortlessly light touch by @entity64 , a low - budget maestro of genre films such as 2006 's " @entity67 " and 2010 's " @entity68 , " " @entity8 " represents a risky proposition for @entity3 on several levels : a director who 's never grappled with a project of this scale before , a menagerie of comic - book characters who are hardly household names ( even to fanboys ) , and a tongue - in - cheek @entity79 vibe that 's more " @entity82 " than " @entity81			1
" but give @entity3 props , even with all of its mega-success ; the studio 's still willing to take chances			1
here , that risk pays off big - time			1
the film 's a giddily subversive space opera that runs on self - aware smart - assery			0
which fowl @entity3 character resurfaces in ' @entity8 ' ? the plot is hardly worth spelling out in too much detail			1
i 'm not sure i could do it justice anyway			0
it 's the usual overstuffed action - adventure boilerplate about trying to retrieve a mystical macguffin — a multilayered orb with the glowing power to destroy worlds — from a sinister baddie ( @entity105 's blue - hued @entity104 )			0
actually , if @entity64 and co-writer @entity107 had just called the orb a tesseract , you 'd basically be re-watching " @entity1			1
" and there 's such a mishmash of seemingly interchangeable alien names ( @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , etc. ) , it 's tempting to tune out , assume it will all make sense in the end , and wait for the next bit of anarchic insult comedy from @entity121 unlike the sober @entity125 seriousness of " @entity126 " or the rah - rah retro - squareness of " @entity128 , " @entity21 and his posse of merry pranksters are such a delirious blast of laughing gas that " guardians " feels more like an unofficial sequel to 1984 's cult hit " @entity134 " than a @entity3 product			1
( i mean that as a compliment			0
) a large share of the credit goes to @entity41			2
on tv 's " @entity143 " and in such big - screen features as " her " and " @entity141 , " he 's always provided a dependable jolt of joy - buzzer surprise in supporting roles			0
now he 's graduated to leading man — the straw that stirs the drink — and he 's such a natural , you ca n't help but wonder why it took so long			1
@entity41 is the man with 12 percent of a plan in ' guardians ' clip the other standout is @entity55 , who gives the motor - mouthed rocket an outer - borough wiseguy honk and a hair - trigger temper			1
he 's like an r - rated @entity160 with a machine gun			0
together , they 're a gang of exiles from the planet of misfit toys			0
or , as @entity47 generously calls them , '' the biggest idiots in the galaxy			0
'' will they learn to overcome their selfishness and embrace responsibility for the first time in their lives ? of course they will			0
the genius of @entity64 's superhero send - up is its cheeky , anything - goes absurdity			2
i 've been pretty mixed on @entity3 movies over the years — some have dazzled me , others have left me depressed			2
but " @entity8 " is the first one that feels excitingly unpredictable			2
