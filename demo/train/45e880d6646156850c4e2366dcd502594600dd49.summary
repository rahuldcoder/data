@entity0 -- newly released documents from @entity5 nominee @entity4 's service on the board of a @entity8 civil rights organization show the group opposed @entity11 's nomination to the high court more than two decades ago			1
judge @entity4 is set to face @entity5 confirmation hearings			2
@entity4 , a judge on the @entity15 - based @entity14 , was nominated by president @entity16 in may to fill the vacancy of retiring justice @entity18			2
her confirmation hearings are set to begin july 13			0
she served as a board member of the @entity21 from 1980 - 92 , leaving when she became a federal judge			1
during her years on the @entity21 board , the group opposed president @entity26 's 1987 nomination of the conservative @entity11 -- then a federal appeals judge -- " because of the threat he poses to the civil rights of the @entity32 community , " according to the documents			1
the group 's attorneys prepared press releases and " worked on numerous efforts to build coalitions against the nominee , " according to the documents			2
@entity11 was ultimately rejected by the @entity41			2
the @entity21 also met in 1987 with staff at the @entity43 to address what it called " negative images of @entity46 presented by the @entity43 ' staff , " including well - known columnist @entity48			1
republicans are challenging @entity4 's record on affirmative action , and the newly released documents on her work at the @entity21 will likely be a centerpiece of debate at the upcoming confirmation hearings			1
the 350 pages of documents released wednesday by the @entity59 show the @entity21 filed hundreds of discrimination lawsuits over the years on behalf of @entity32			1
the documents do not reveal whether @entity4 was directly involved in them			1
she was a private attorney at the time , and was volunteering for the group			0
however , they reflect the @entity21 's strong push to establish a precedent of cases that would establish legal authority to uphold workplace quotas for minorities			1
one case dealt with promotions in the @entity73			0
a may 1992 memo on " litigation highlights " noted , " we obtained quota promotions for @entity78 and @entity79 to the rank of sergeant			0
" a @entity21 class - action lawsuit filed on behalf of minority applicants claimed advancement exams were " discriminatory and not job related			2
" the city settled , agreeing to promotions that reflected the percentage of @entity32 test - takers			0
@entity90 and retroactive seniority were also provided			0
" as a result , " said the memo , " almost 100 hispanics were promoted , over twice the number that would have been promoted without the settlement			0
" fast forward 17 years to a case @entity4 heard as an appeals judge			2
she and her colleagues rejected a lawsuit by white firefighters in @entity102 , @entity103 , after the city threw out the results of promotional exams because too few minorities qualified for advancement			0
in the case , one @entity32 and 19 white firefighters who scored high on the exams and would have gained captain and lieutenant positions claimed " reverse " discrimination			2
last week , the @entity5 ruled in favor of the so - called " @entity102 20 , " concluding " the city rejected the test results solely because the higher scoring candidates were white			0
" justice @entity119 , writing for the majority said , " no individual should face workplace discrimination based on race			0
" the high court said municipalities would now have to establish " a strong basis of evidence " that promotion tests were unfairly designed or administered before nullifying them , and not simply because too many minorities did poorly			1
@entity4 's views in the case have been criticized by some conservatives , saying it shows she supports racial preferences for @entity32 and other minorities			1
the high court dissent , however , criticized the ruling for reinterpreting what @entity140 intended			1
" @entity140 endeavored to promote equal opportunity in fact , and not simply in form , " wrote justice @entity144			0
" the damage today 's decision does to that objective is untold			0
" supporters also contend the @entity21 documents add nothing to the nomination debate			1
" documents that @entity4 did not write , or approve -- many of them more than two decades old -- are irrelevant to her nomination , " according to a @entity157 statement			1
" the @entity41 should judge her on her own record -- especially her judicial record -- not on briefs that other lawyers wrote 20 years ago			0
" opponents , however , claim @entity4 's prior work for @entity21 , and her off - the - bench comments reveal doubts about her fairness and impartiality as a judge			1
in addition , some republicans on the committee expressed concern the material was released only 12 days before the hearings begin			0
" this has all the hallmarks of a deliberate delay and an attempt to frustrate a thorough review of this important information , " said @entity176 , a spokesman for sen. @entity177 of @entity178 , ranking @entity179 on the committee			0
" if these dilatory tactics continue , it will be increasingly more difficult for the hearing to go forward on july 13			0
" @entity4 supporters point out a similar " document dump " by the @entity193 in the days before chief justice @entity191 testified before the @entity41 in september 2005			2
and the @entity195 administration also refused to turn over material from justice @entity198 's prior service in the @entity26 and @entity199 in the 1980s , arguing his subsequent judicial record was sufficient to determine his qualifications to sit on the high court .			1

@entity4 once served on the @entity21
@entity205 opposed the 1987 nomination of @entity11 to the high court
supporters : @entity21 documents add nothing to the nomination debate
