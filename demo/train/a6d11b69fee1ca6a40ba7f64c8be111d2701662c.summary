-- @entity1 blasted the @entity2 on saturday for its recent public criticism and urging of diplomacy to address territorial disputes in the @entity6 , saying the @entity2 statement shows " total disregard for the facts " and sends " a seriously wrong message			1
" the blistering statement , from @entity1 foreign ministry spokesman @entity12 , follows one issued the previous day by a counterpart at the @entity15			2
the debate revolves around who controls islands and waters in the @entity6			1
countries such as @entity21 and the @entity22 lay claim to some areas			0
@entity12 stated unequivocally saturday that " @entity1 has indisputable sovereignty over the @entity6 and adjacent waters			2
" acting @entity15 deputy spokesman @entity27 began his statement friday insisting the @entity2 does " not take a position on competing territorial claims ... and ( has ) no territorial ambitions in the @entity6			1
" yet he added that @entity32 believes countries " should work collaboratively and diplomatically to resolve disputes without coercion , without intimidation , without threats and without the use of force			0
" @entity27 suggested that not all nations in the region are taking this latter approach , expressing @entity2 concern about the " increase in tensions in the @entity6 " in the form of " confrontational rhetoric , " " coercive economic actions and the incidents around the @entity50 , including the use of barriers to deny access			2
" " in particular , @entity1 's upgrading of the administrative level of @entity59 and establishment of a new military garrison there covering disputed areas of the @entity6 run counter to collaborative diplomatic efforts to resolve differences and risk further escalating tensions in the region , " @entity27 said , before urging the nations involved to agree on ways to peacefully address disputes			1
@entity12 , the @entity1 foreign ministry spokesman , started his statement -- which was posted on his ministry 's website -- by accusing the @entity2 of confounding " right and wrong " and undermining regional efforts to " uphold peace and stability in the @entity6 and the @entity41 at large			1
" @entity1 's action in @entity59 , specifically , is a " necessary adjustment " that falls " well within @entity1 's sovereign rights , " the spokesman said			0
@entity12 accused other nations of not abiding by a 2002 agreement involving @entity81 , or @entity81 , members			0
the @entity1 spokesman then singled out @entity32 for what he suggested was hypocrisy and " unfounded accusations ... against @entity1 's normal and reasonable acts			2
" " people can not but question the true intention of the @entity2 side , " @entity12 wrote			0
he challenged the @entity2 for overlooking other nations " marking out a large number of oil and gas blocks in the @entity6 " and claiming " as its own @entity1 's islands , reefs and waters			1
" @entity32 , too , has ignored it when other nation 's navies have threatened @entity1 fishermen , @entity12 claimed			0
if the @entity2 truly was n't taking positions on territorial disputes , then why did it speak up now and " stir up trouble at a time when countries concerned in the region are stepping up dialogue ? " he asked rhetorically			1
" the @entity2 needs to follow the trend of the times and respect the shared aspirations and consensus of countries in the region for peace , stability and development , " @entity12 said			0
" it should respect @entity1 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , and act in a way that contributes to stability and prosperity of the @entity41 and not otherwise			0
