-- what a difference a year makes			0
last year , delegates at the @entity3 in @entity4 had a lot to contend with			0
the economic crisis was in full bloom and they had urgent concerns : will @entity9 leave the eurozone ? will the euro survive ? is the project doomed ? a year on , it seems those worries have eased ; the mood has lightened and the crisis is finally over			1

that much i 'm aware of , but what do the captains of industry feel needs to be done to get @entity24 growing and competing on the world stage ? unemployment @entity36 , the managing director of @entity37 , one of @entity4 's leading manufacturer of automotive brakes , tells me over an espresso that unemployment is his biggest worry			1
he tells me job creation should be @entity24 's priority " to have stable growth , with growth of consumption , you need to create jobs			1
if you do n't produce , you do n't buy			0
so the question is how we can foster a stable increase in jobs			2
" read more : @entity55 exports are bright spark for economy @entity58 , the vice-president of the @entity59 is of the same opinion			1
in fact , he tells me this is his project : building new jobs for young people by creating a new education policy in @entity24			1
to do this he says , we need to build " a link between schools and small and medium - size businesses			0
this exists in @entity74 and @entity75			0
we need this in every @entity24 state			1
" it 's refreshing to see youth unemployment has n't been ignored , after all , @entity55 and @entity9 are both struggling under the weight of 56.1 % and 62.9 % youth unemployment respectively			1
read more : @entity82 unfazed by copycats but whilst the talk is promising , i find it rather strange that the discussion is being led by a group of middle - age men who know little of the challenges young people face			1
i know it , because i too have had to deal with student debt , job applications and random jobs on the side			2
but now i 'm veering off - point			0
cohesion alongside talk of unemployment , growth and competitiveness , key words crept up time and time again to my surprise : cohesion and political union			2
@entity107 , the chairman and ceo of @entity110 , felt strongly about this subject , arguing that to grow again and compete with the likes of @entity113 and @entity114 , @entity24 must work closer together			1
read more : the @entity115 : a nation under water he candidly told me : " we have a @entity24 that needs a project that refines more deeply the countries			1
we have a @entity24 that does n't have enough cohesion , there are no common projects on the many issues such as energy			1
" his words echo those of @entity59 president @entity130 , who this week called for a " @entity24 that is united , strong and open			1
" it all returns to his famous quote : " we swim together , we sink together			0
" stability and @entity135 this year at the @entity137 , there is definitely a sense that @entity24 is thinking together ; acknowledging that there can be strength in their numbers			2
but for all the talk of @entity24 's economic achievements , of green shoots of recovery , there were reminders , alarm bells of sorts of the risks of complacency			2
read more : recession leaves bitter taste for @entity4 coffee makers @entity156 , the ceo of @entity157 , was perhaps the most pessimistic on @entity24 -- warning about political instability and complacency " there is still a need to be very alert			1
stability is a competitive factor			0
we do n't need a government crisis right now , " he told me			0
four days later in his @entity169 address , @entity130 touched on the same subject when he said that the biggest downside risk to @entity24 's recovery is political			2
of course , @entity130 did n't single out any particular country , but the warning could have been directed at @entity4 whose coalition is facing an uncertain political future after the country 's top court found former prime mnister @entity179 guilty of tax fraud			0
there is no doubt that @entity24 is breathing a bit easier again			2
the crisis has abated and our politicians are smiling once more			0
but let 's not start popping the prosecco , cava or @entity190 just yet			0
