-- @entity2 governments , including the @entity3 , appear to be stepping up efforts to censor internet search results and @entity7 videos , according to a " transparency report " released by @entity9			1
" it 's alarming not only because free expression is at risk , but because some of these requests come from countries you might not suspect -- @entity2 democracies not typically associated with censorship , " @entity17 , a senior policy analyst at @entity9 , wrote in a blog post on sunday night			1
" for example , in the second half of last year , @entity22 regulators asked us to remove 270 search results that linked to blogs and articles in newspapers referencing individuals and public figures , including mayors and public prosecutors			0
in @entity34 , we received a request from a public institution to remove links to a site that criticized it			0
we did n't comply with either of these requests			0
" in the last half of 2011 , @entity3 agencies asked @entity9 to remove 6,192 individual pieces of content from its search results , blog posts or archives of online videos , according to the report			1
that 's up 718 % compared with the 757 such items that @entity3 agencies asked @entity9 to remove in the six months prior			1
overall , @entity9 received 187 requests from @entity3 law enforcement agencies and courts to remove content from its web properties from july to december , up 103 % from the 92 requests the @entity59 , @entity60 , company received in the previous reporting period			1
in one incident cited in the report , a @entity3 law enforcement agency asked @entity9 to take down a blog that " allegedly defamed a law enforcement official in a personal capacity			1
" the company did not comply with that request			0
in another , a separate law enforcement group asked @entity9 to take down 1,400 @entity7 videos ( @entity9 owns @entity7 ) because of " alleged harassment			2
" and in @entity74 , the passport office asked @entity9 to delete a @entity7 video " of a @entity74 citizen urinating on his passport and flushing it down the toilet , " according to the report			2
the tech company did not oblige either of those requests but did comply at least in part with 42 % of the removal requests from the @entity3 in the last half of 2011 , the report says			1
that number is down considerably compared to previous reports ; in the latter half of 2010 , for example , @entity9 said it complied with 87 % of @entity3 requests to remove content			1
the biannual transparency report , which includes data to july 2009 , also indicates a rise in world governments ' requests to take a look at the data @entity9 collects about its users			1
and with those requests , @entity9 tended to be much more likely to comply			0
in the last half of 2011 , @entity9 received 6,321 requests for user data from government agencies in the @entity3 and complied at least in part with 93 % of them , according to data released in the report			1
those requests for information about @entity9 users come as part of criminal investigations , @entity9 says , and are not unique to the company			0
@entity9 complied more frequently with @entity3 - based requests for information about users than with requests from other countries , according to the report			2
it complied or partially complied with only 24 % of such requests from @entity74 , 44 % from @entity120 and 64 % from the @entity121 , for example			0
the number of user data requests @entity9 received from the @entity3 was up 6 % over the previous six - month period and 37 % compared with the last half of 2010			1
@entity9 says this increase " is n't surprising , since each year we offer more products and services , and we have a larger number of users			0
" in the report , the company adds : " we review each request to make sure that it complies with both the spirit and the letter of the law , and we may refuse to produce information or try to narrow the request in some cases			0
" writing at @entity142 , tech columnist @entity141 says that @entity9 " should be applauded for taking a strong stand against censorship " but that " the government 's increasingly sticky fingers in @entity9 's databases comes at a sensitive time			2
" " @entity9 has been criticized for failing to reveal much about its reported partnership with the @entity150 following a @entity152 attack on its systems in 2010 , " he writes			0
" and the company has yet to take a stand on the @entity157 's recently - passed @entity156 or its equivalents in the @entity159 , which are designed to give companies far more leeway to hand data over to government agencies for security purposes			2
" at @entity166 , blogger @entity165 says the report " will certainly challenge any notions you might have about a free and unregulated web			0
" @entity9 says it hopes the data will offer a " small window into what 's happening on the web at large			0

in last half of 2011 , @entity3 agencies asked @entity9 to remove 6,192 pieces of content
that 's up 718 % compared with the previous six - month period
