@entity0 -- once fearing one of the worst days in the state 's history for battling wildfires , @entity3 firefighters got the upper hand sunday on several blazes though others remained out of their control			1
the six new wildfires reported sunday , all in different counties , were relatively small and quickly brought under control , the @entity12 said in a statement			1
" ( firefighters were ) pretty lucky today , " said @entity17 , a spokesman for the state 's @entity18			1
the most damage -- to an unoccupied mobile home , horse trailer and another building -- occurred over an acre in @entity26 , but that fire was controlled			0
eleven structures were threatened and one camper was lost over 129 acres in @entity31 , the state agency added			1
still , despite successes in squelching these blazes , authorities were fighting to manage 19 other , appreciably bigger blazes			0
this challenge , as well as the weather outlook , had prompted the @entity12 to state that " conditions on sunday could shape up to be among the worst in @entity3 history			1
" gov. @entity42 renewed a disaster proclamation in effect for all of @entity3 ' 249 counties -- even though major fires are occurring in 13 of them -- to expedite assistance in case of new fires , his office said sunday in a statement			2
in addition to more than 750 personnel working with the @entity12 , the governor 's statement noted that two @entity61 helicopters with the @entity62 , bulldozers from the state transportation department and resources from 60 fire departments statewide were part of the effort			1
authorities in the lone star state have responded to 6,831 fires over 643,000 acres since wildfire season began			1
the biggest fire still not under control was continuing sunday in 71,000 acres in parts of @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity75 counties			1
air resources , bulldozers , fire engines and other tools and personnel were being used in that fight , the @entity12 said			2
another of the hardest slogs may be in @entity84 , where none of the 60,000 imperiled acres was considered to be contained sunday			2
the @entity12 has deployed three air tankers , 60 firefighters , bulldozers and other equipment and personnel , in addition to a host of other state and local resources , focused on this blaze			1
already , 30 to 40 homes in @entity95 have been lost due to this fire , according to the @entity12			2
another 34 homes have burned in @entity98 , due to a fire over 16,500 acres that the state agency on sunday described as " very active " and not at all contained			1
a @entity102 shelter has been set up at @entity103 for those displaced or otherwise affected by this wildfire			0
" ( firefighters ) ca n't outrun it , " said @entity17			0
there have been no evacuations yet related to another 60,000 - acre blaze , this one in @entity112 and @entity113 counties near the city of @entity115			0
that fire is 50 % contained and is still considered a threat to the towns of @entity119 and @entity120			0
@entity3 is not alone , as wildfires are burning in large swaths of the @entity123 and @entity124 , fanned in part by dry , warm and windy conditions			0
the @entity127 has issued " red flag warnings " through sunday evening -- indicative of what it calls " critical fire weather conditions " -- in @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity3			1
but by sunday night , such warnings were only in effect for parts of @entity3 and @entity131			1
@entity135 gov. @entity139 on sunday extended a state of emergency for seven counties			2
the designation authorizes state agencies to make emergency purchases needed to quickly deliver resources to local jurisdictions , the state 's emergency operations center said			0
the @entity127 has posted fire warnings for the western two - thirds of the state			2
on saturday , a grass fire burning just south of @entity153 , @entity135 , prompted evacuations			0
as many as 70 firefighters were involved in the response , as well as three helicopters , said @entity158 , a spokesman with the @entity159			0
twelve families checked into a @entity102 shelter , but more were evacuated , he said			0
@entity158 said saturday there had been no reports of injuries			0
in @entity3 , the fear is that relentless heavy winds and dry weather could spawn a rash of wildfires similar to those that swept across the southern plains states on april 9 , 2009			0
those fires scorched 147,924 acres , destroyed 111 homes and killed four people , the @entity12 stated on its website			1
@entity1 's @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178 contributed to this report .			0
