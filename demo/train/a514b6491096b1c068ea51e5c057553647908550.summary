@entity0 , @entity1 -- the first school assembly since the earthquake was charged with emotion and grief			1
students gather for the emotional assembly at their school in @entity0 , @entity1			1
students at @entity11 in @entity0 have been arriving amid the ruins of their classrooms hoping life will get back to normal quickly			1
they still do n't know how many pupils were victims of the earthquake			2
only half the 800 students turned up monday			1
but there was a gasp of shock as the vice principal informed them that one member of staff had been killed in the quake			2
as prayers and a lament were sung in the yard , the emotion was too much for one teacher who fainted and was carried away			1
many students have stories of narrow escapes and cheating death by seconds			1
@entity36 told me she was taking a shower when suddenly the bathroom started shaking violently			2
she grabbed a towel and ran downstairs and jumped out of a window , just as her house collapsed behind her			2
many are clearly traumatized by what happened , mentioning how scared they are that another quake will again turn their world upside down			0
the teachers too seem stunned by what 's happened			0
most of the classrooms here are full of rubble and lessons are now being conducted in a tent outside , provided by @entity55 , or @entity55			0
17 - year - old student @entity56 , said : " when i see my school , very big destruction , i get a little sad , but i am very happy to be back to my school			0
" the school 's @entity61 teacher , a warm , animated woman called @entity63 said : " they feel very sad , they ca n't control their emotions , what pity our school is broken			0
" in some ways the very spirit of the school has been damaged			0
it was built in 1917 during the @entity74 colonial period and has survived numerous earthquakes down the years			1
but this one ripped the place apart , leaving mountains of red bricks lying on the desks and huge gaping holes in the ceiling			0
one building is simply too dangerous to enter and may have to be torn down			0
everywhere there are little reminders of the day the earth shook so violently : the trophy cabinet full of toppled sports awards , the covered walkways choked with smashed stone pillars			0
the senior students are already wondering how they will cope when it comes to their important mid-term exams next week			1
the principal has announced a postponement , while they find a suitable room			0
slowly the students at this highly - acclaimed school will refocus on their studies , but no one will forget that day at the end of september when everything changed in @entity0 .			1

death toll from two *powerful* earthquakes that struck @entity1 has risen to *608*
*343* are still missing *officially* , although the number could be *closer* to 1000
students at @entity11 in @entity0 said prayers for dead and missing
many students have stories of narrow escapes and cheating death by seconds
