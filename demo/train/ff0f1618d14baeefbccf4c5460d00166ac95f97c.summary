the first commercial mission to the @entity1 ended thursday with the @entity3 capsule splashing down after a flight the company 's founder declared a " grand slam			1
" @entity8 drifted beneath parachutes to the surface of the @entity11 , about 560 miles off @entity12 , on thursday morning			0
it hit the water about a mile from its target , @entity3 founder @entity13 told reporters			1
" this has been a fantastic day , " @entity13 said , adding , " i 'm just overwhelmed with joy			1
" he said recovery crews have reached the capsule and report it " looks really good			2
" @entity24 came at 8:42 a.m. ( 11:42 a.m. et ) , about two minutes earlier than expected , @entity3 and @entity23 reported			1
@entity13 was on hand at the company 's mission control center near @entity28 as operators monitored the descent , and called the mission a " grand slam " in a briefing later thursday			0
@entity24 came nine days after it took off on its historic mission , during which it delivered food , clothing , computer equipment and supplies for science experiments to the orbital platform and returned with about 1,300 pounds of cargo -- everything from trash to scientific research and experimental samples			0
the space station 's robotic arm released the @entity3 at 5:35 a.m. et. a thruster burn a minute later pushed the spacecraft away from its host , according to @entity3 , the private company that built and operates the vessel			1
@entity53 , @entity23 's head of commercial space systems , said the space agency is waiting to recover the spacecraft 's cargo and will review post-flight reports			2
but he told @entity13 , " we became a customer today			0
" " we 've been waiting for this day , and it certainly is a tremendous day , " @entity53 said			2
" we 're looking forward now to routine , regular cargo service			0
" space analyst @entity63 said the flight was a demonstration of the company 's capabilities , and the spacecraft was n't carrying critical equipment or supplies			2
" if none of this cargo had gone up or down , the show would have gone on , " said @entity63 , a former @entity71 correspondent			0
its next mission , expected later this year , " will be a for - real cargo with mission - critical items			0
" " as time goes on , there will be more important stuff that will go up and down on @entity3 , " he said			1
@entity8 's re-entry mimicked the way @entity85 capsules returned to @entity86 after putting men on the moon in the 1960s and 1970s , but which fell out of use during the space shuttle era			0
recovery divers were waiting on boats just outside the projecting landing area , ready to secure the spacecraft and tow it to a barge with a crane to hoist the space vehicle aboard			0
@entity3 calls its capsule is " the only spacecraft capable of returning a significant amount of cargo from the space station , " saying that other vehicles that deliver cargo to the @entity1 are destroyed after they leave the station			1
@entity8 is designed to be re-usable and ultimately , to carry as many as seven people into orbit			0
@entity3 triumph : only the beginning the mission began may 22 , when a @entity113 rocket launched the capsule into space from @entity116 , @entity117			1
@entity23 collaborated with @entity3 on every part of the mission and gave final authorization for the flight			1
@entity3 reached the station friday and was " captured " by the station 's robotic arm			1
the mission , hailed by @entity23 administrator @entity126 as a step toward a new future of private innovation in the space industry , comes as government funding of the space program decreases			0
it also marks the culmination of six years of preparation to bring commercial flights to the space station after the retirement of @entity23 's space shuttle fleet in 2011 , which left the @entity139 with no means of independently sending humans into space			2
without the shuttle , @entity23 relies on the @entity144 to ferry @entity139 astronauts to orbit and has limited capabilities to send supplies to the station and bring them back			0
@entity3 fills a need in taking significant payload back and forth , current @entity1 astronaut @entity150 said			1
@entity23 : the end of the galaxy as we know it ? in december 2008 , @entity23 announced it had chosen @entity3 's @entity113 launch vehicle and @entity3 to resupply @entity1 crews after the shuttle 's retirement			1
the $ 1.6 billion contract involves a minimum of 12 flights , with an option to order more missions for additional cost , according to @entity3			1
@entity3 is one of a few of private companies receiving @entity23 funds to develop the capability for commercial transport of astronauts into space			1
@entity13 , who founded the internet service @entity175 , has said the commercial program 's fixed - price , pay - for - performance contracts make fiscal sense for taxpayers and fosters competition among companies on reliability , capability and cost			2
astronaut @entity184 , also aboard the space station , called the mission a great first step in the commercialization of spaceflight , and @entity150 agreed			0
" commercial spaceflight will blossom due to its own merits , and does n't really hinge on one mission , " @entity150 said			0
" it will hinge on the viability of launching many missions over a long period of time and being able to provide useful commercial goods and services in the low - earth orbit arena			0
" @entity3 is now developing a heavy - lift rocket with twice the cargo capability of the space shuttle and hopes to build a spacecraft that could carry a crew to @entity205 .			2

" this has been a fantastic day , " @entity3 founder says
the return caps the first commercial flight to the @entity1
