-- the world watched @entity2 , and @entity2 watched the world turn red and blue			2
according to some analysts more than 600 million people across the globe tuned into see the blue of @entity7 beat the red of @entity10 1 - 0 , arguably the biggest audience for the biggest match in @entity14 history			1
@entity16 's headed goal deep in first - half injury time was enough to take @entity7 top of the league from their rivals on goal difference			1
psychologically , with two games left , it could prove decisive and hand @entity7 the advantage as they hunt a historic first @entity14 title			1
the match itself was enthralling without being exciting , tense without many chances on goal			1
but by the end , as @entity7 fans sang their club 's famous adopted song " @entity35 , " there was a sense that history was being witnessed			1
@entity10 coach @entity39 lost his cool and remonstrated with his opposite number @entity42			1
but the game was lost for @entity10			1
perhaps as one empire rises , another falls			0
tv networks from @entity47 to @entity48 sent their chief correspondents to relay something of the febrile atmosphere to their expectant domestic audiences , audiences that have taken @entity55 football as their own over the past two decades			0
even in @entity60 , traditionally one of the few bastions of football refuseniks , tv chiefs decided to upgrade the match to @entity63 's main channel			1
this , @entity0 's @entity64 told us , was a very big deal indeed			2
yet it was n't always like this			0
once , not so long ago , few outside of those standing on the terraces attending this derby match in the north west of @entity55 would have been able to watch the spectacle			1
true the @entity2 derby has always been a passionate , sometimes brutal affair over the years			2
the fortunes of both the red half of @entity10 and the blue of @entity7 have ebbed and flowed as the decades pass			1
@entity7 have n't won the league for 44 years			1
instead they watched @entity10 become the greatest team of the @entity14 era , not to mention arguably the most recognizable and profitable brand in the world			1
but in 1974 the boot was on the other foot when @entity88 -- a @entity10 legend who had signed for @entity7 -- sheepishly backheeled the goal that relegated @entity10 to the second division			1
such a scenario in 2012 would be unthinkable			0
today the @entity2 derby has reached the kind of global prominence that @entity95 versus @entity96 -- even if @entity98 's biggest match is n't a derby in the truest sense of the word -- would normally enjoy			1
its rise is much more than just the story of two successful football teams			0
the rise of the @entity2 derby is also the story of the rise of globalization			0
@entity10 and @entity7 are separated by just five miles yet the local has become the global			1
on the pitch , 10 different nationalities featured			0
the stadium 's naming rights have been sold to a @entity116 airline			0
@entity10 is owned by the @entity118 family , the @entity60 venture capitalists who knew virtually nothing about football outside of their love of the @entity124 , who bought the @entity55 club in an unpopular leveraged buy out			2
@entity7 has been transformed by the mega money from the @entity129 world , owned as it is by @entity130 from the ruling family of @entity132 in the @entity133			2
it was @entity130 's money that turned a sleepy , underperforming club into champions elect			0
as the movement of capital and talent has been made easier , football -- and especially the @entity14 -- has reaped the financial benefits			2
but no two entities have benefited more than @entity2 's two football clubs			0
" i think we deserved to win this game , " @entity42 told @entity145 after the match			2
" i think next saturday we 'll have another difficult day			0
" and he 's right , of course			0
@entity7 easily fended off @entity10 's late charge			1
@entity10 did n't even manage a shot on target during the entire 90 minutes			2
now the two teams are equal on points with just two matches left			0
as @entity42 said , next saturday will be the same as monday ; a difficult day , almost too close to call			0
but there 's one thing that you can predict			0
on saturday the world will be watching once again .			0
