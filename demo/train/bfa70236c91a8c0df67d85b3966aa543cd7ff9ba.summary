@entity0 , @entity1 -- in a possible portent of growing factional conflict , a leading @entity7 minister was removed from @entity1 's government , and the @entity7 semi-autonomous government took over two oilfields in the north , officials said friday			1
foreign minister @entity13 , the face of @entity1 diplomacy for a more than a decade , was removed friday by prime minister @entity16 , two senior @entity1 government officials said			1
@entity13 's ouster occurred as @entity7 in @entity1 's government launched a boycott followed comments made thursday by @entity16 , who purportedly linked @entity21 extremists and @entity22 to the @entity23 in @entity24			1
the @entity7 strongly dispute @entity16 's allegations and say he wants to scapegoat the @entity7 for his failures in northern @entity1 and divert attention from how @entity21 militants have poured into @entity1 and waged warfare against the government , a senior @entity7 official said			1
the senior @entity7 official accused @entity16 of trying to turn a conflict between @entity16 's @entity34 - dominated government and @entity35 -- some of whom have supported the extremists from the @entity39 in @entity1 and @entity40 -- into a dispute between @entity42 and @entity7			1
appointed as interim foreign minister was @entity44 , a @entity34 and an @entity16 adviser who is deputy prime minister for energy affairs , two senior @entity1 government officials said			1
the officials told @entity2 that @entity13 was replaced after @entity7 ministers boycotted @entity49 meetings			2
@entity2 was not able to reach anyone at the prime minister 's office for comment			2
oil field seizures meanwhile , the @entity7 ' @entity55 forces on friday seized two oilfields -- one medium - sized and the other small -- though the fields were n't under any threat from @entity21 , a @entity7 government source said			1
the @entity7 took the oilfields after accusing @entity1 's @entity62 of trying to " sabotage the recent mutually - agreed pipeline infrastructure linking the @entity65 dome with the @entity67 field " in northern @entity1 , the @entity23 said			1
that new pipeline was to help increase revenues for @entity1 " at a time of great need and at a time when most of the @entity1 - @entity76 pipeline is under @entity21 control , " the @entity7 government said			1
the @entity7 government accused @entity0 of ordering officials not to use the new pipeline to export oil and instead to re-inject the oil back into an unused field in @entity82 in the north			0
" this politically motivated decision risked causing great damage to the field in question with a permanent loss of most of the oil that has been re-injected			0
it has also deprived the people of @entity1 of much - needed oil export revenue , " the @entity7 government said			1
" this morning 's events have shown that the ( @entity23 ) is determined to protect and defend @entity1 's oil infrastructure whenever it is threatened by acts of terrorism or , as in this case , politically motivated sabotage , " the @entity7 government said			2
despite being unable to export , the @entity65 and @entity99 fields were producing about 110,000 barrels of oil per day , the @entity7 government said			0
@entity0 and @entity24 have long been at odds , especially over @entity102 of the 2005 @entity1 @entity103			0
the document called for a referendum that never happened : the vote was supposed to have determined the final status of several disputed areas such as @entity82 and small villages in @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 claimed by the central government and the @entity115 government			0
@entity0 often accuses @entity24 of signing illegal oil deals			0
a minister since the @entity119 invasion as a leading @entity7 and government figure in @entity1 , @entity13 had been @entity1 's foreign minister since 2003 , after the @entity119 - led overthrow of @entity123 , according to his profile on the @entity126 website			1
before that , he was involved in the @entity7 resistance against the @entity123 regime , and he was head of the @entity131 's international relations bureau			0
his ouster came as @entity23 president @entity133 called on all @entity7 members of the @entity1 parliament and @entity7 ministers in the @entity1 government to return to the @entity115 in northern @entity1 , said @entity138 , a leader in the @entity139			2
@entity138 , also head of the @entity131 bloc in the @entity1 parliament , added that no @entity7 member of parliament will attend sunday 's parliament session called for by the caretaker speaker of parliament , @entity143			2
@entity138 also told @entity2 that the @entity7 ministers in the @entity1 government will not participate in cabinet meetings for the time being			2
@entity7 participation in @entity1 's government formation will depend on the outcome of the decisions made by the @entity7 alliance in @entity24 , a senior @entity7 official told @entity2			1
last month , @entity133 gave his strongest - ever indication that the @entity7 region would seek formal independence from the rest of @entity1 , he told @entity2			2
" @entity1 is obviously falling apart , " @entity133 said			0
" the time is here for the @entity115 people to determine their future and the decision of the people is what we are going to uphold			0
" @entity1 @entity7 independence has long been something of a dream , and the region has had semi-autonomy from @entity0 for more than two decades			0
but @entity1 's latest crisis , in which @entity35 extremists have captured a large swath of @entity1 territory on the border of @entity115 , seems to have pushed the @entity7 over the edge			0
" now we are living [ in ] a new @entity1 , which is different completely from the @entity1 that we always knew , the @entity1 that we lived in 10 days or two weeks ago , " @entity133 said last month			0
@entity175 : understanding the @entity1 crisis @entity2 's @entity177 contributed to this report .			0
