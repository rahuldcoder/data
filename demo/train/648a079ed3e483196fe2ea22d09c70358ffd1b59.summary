-- like misery , failure loves company			0
look at the immigration debate and how both liberals and conservatives -- and elected officials in both parties -- bungle it			2
president @entity10 has failed on immigration policy			1
but now that he appears to be poised to take executive action to fix some of what 's broken with the country 's immigration system , @entity16 in @entity17 sound like they 're about to overreact and join him in that failure			1
conservatives love to stir their flock by pushing the narrative that @entity10 is a staunch supporter of " amnesty " and that the president has always been in lockstep with immigration reform advocates			1
it 's been a rocky relationship			0
that 's because @entity10 belongs to that wing of the @entity33 that has n't been interested in legalizing the undocumented and creating more competition in the job market for @entity38 workers			1
@entity10 broke his campaign promise to make reform a top issue and eroded trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement by expanding 100-fold the program known as @entity46 , which ropes local police into enforcing federal immigration law			1
he tried to fend off critics who wanted him to slow deportations by claiming that he did n't have the power to act " as a king , " only to later flip - flop and do just that during his 2012 re-election campaign when he unveiled @entity54 ( @entity54 )			1
@entity10 deported a record 2 million people in five years , divided hundreds of thousands of families , failed to deal effectively with thousands of child refugees who streamed across the @entity60 last summer and then broke another promise when he said he would take executive action on immigration before the midterm elections but blinked			1
now , according to news reports that look like a trial balloon from the @entity67 , @entity10 might , as early as this week , take unilateral action to offer several million illegal immigrants a temporary reprieve from deportation and perhaps even give some of them work permits			1
if it materializes , i 'll be proved wrong			0
a few months ago , i said this would never happen and now it looks like it might			0
options include some common sense items : eliminating @entity46 ; broadening @entity54 by eliminating restrictions on how old applicants can be and when they had to have arrived ; restating that the enforcement priority should be to remove violent criminals and not housekeepers and students ; and expanding visa programs for immigrant spouses of @entity38 citizens			0
but it 's the final item on the list that could really upset the apple cart : deferred action for parents of @entity38 citizens and legal permanent residents , which could result in as many as 4 million to 5 million people getting a temporary reprieve from deportation			1
when those undocumented college students known as @entity100 first argued for special treatment , the claim was based on the simple idea that they were brought here as children and thus did n't intentionally choose to break the law			2
but the same thing ca n't be said of their parents , who did intentionally break the law			2
now what ? is there a new argument ? besides , if @entity10 offers deferred action to parents , it will validate what conservatives have always insisted about how the @entity38 - born children of illegal immigrants can be used to keep their parents from being deported			1
that has never been the case			0
parents get deported all the time , and their @entity38 - citizen kids either go with them or stay on this side of the border and get put in foster care			2
@entity16 have been wrong all along			1
now , if he goes too far , @entity10 could prove them right			2
if the president follows through on the proposed course of action , both sides will need to calm down			2
those on the left should hold their applause			0
by ending the deportation juggernaut , the president would merely be putting out a fire that he started			2
besides , this is just a temporary reprieve that would require the undocumented to surrender to law enforcement officials , get fingerprinted and all the rest			0
and it could all be revoked by the next president			0
finally , this is not what @entity10 promised way back when -- that he would work aggressively with @entity17 to pass legislation that would permanently improve the lives of millions			2
it 's " reform lite			0
" yet at the same time , those on the right need to rein in their scorn			0
in the post 9/11 era , conservatives should n't need a reminder of something they 've been telling us for years : how sweeping can be the executive power of the president			1
as head of the executive branch , @entity10 naturally has the power to set priorities for the enforcement of immigration law			1
@entity16 have no trouble deflecting criticism by reminding @entity169 voters that @entity10 is in charge of deportations			1
so , instead of threatening the suicidal tantrums of a government shutdown or impeachment , conservatives should pipe down and let him be in charge of deportations			0
that does n't just mean deciding who goes but also who stays			0
besides , @entity16 like to talk tough about illegal immigration and the need to uphold the " rule of law " but that slogan would mean more coming from them if they did n't always run away from enforcing those laws that target the root of illegal immigration : @entity38 employers who hire the undocumented , many of whom contribute to the re-election campaigns of @entity16 lawmakers			1
what @entity10 has in mind is n't some kindhearted miracle or the coming of the apocalypse			1
it 's just a legitimate exercise of the power that any president would have under the @entity203 and our system of government			0
i know that is n't sexy , or inspiring , or inflammatory			0
it wo n't help the parties fundraise			0
but it does have the advantage of being true .			0

@entity214 says executive action on immigration would be legal , *warranted*
@entity16 err by claiming it would be an " impeachable offense , " he says
if president @entity10 can set rules for deportation , he can also relax them , he says
@entity214 : the action would n't amount to full - *fledged* immigration reform
