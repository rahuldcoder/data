@entity0 -- cyber security is big news right now			1
it seems a new high - profile breach is reported almost daily and yet this represents only the very tip of the iceberg			0
backed by a highly organized black market worth billions of dollars , cybercrime has grown exponentially in scale and sophistication in recent years			1
in the face of this mounting threat , government and industry are manning the defenses			0
but finding the right people to protect some of our most valuable data is n't straightforward and requires a new approach			2
over the past three years i have competed in a unique set of security games , backed by @entity26 government , industry , academics and professional bodies , known as the @entity29			1
this aims to find talented amateurs by testing their skills with realistic competitions			0
read more : international cyber attacks on the rise in my time playing the @entity29 i have come face to face ( or face to screen ) with many dangerous viruses and computer code , and defended networks from simulated live - hacking attempts carried out by the @entity26 's leading cyber defense experts			1
last week , i was fortunate enough to be crowned the @entity26 's cyber security champion			1
it 's an experience that has taught me much about the skills required to defend a computer system , but also about the difficulties the industry faces finding people with these skills			2
this is a major problem as cyber-attacks become more frequent and threaten us on various levels			0
the first aspect is the threat posed to the internet - using public			0
scam emails and infected websites still represent a major source of income for cyber criminals			2
from a technical point these threats are easily solved through freely available anti-virus software and the use of decent solid passwords for your online accounts			0
however , the attacks continue due to the ease of bypassing these defenses by compromising the user			0
technical defenses are of little use if the user clicks on the wrong link or accepts security warnings automatically without question			2
the fact these scams are still out there shows they are still effective and we have some way to go to educate the public on safe use of the internet			0
above this sits corporate and industrial vulnerability that threatens organisations ' most valuable data -- be it financial records , customer data or intellectual property			0
the @entity26 government has placed the potential cost of a single corporate cyber-attack in the hundreds of millions and it 's not just traditional technology and internet - based companies that are at risk			1
whether it is the pharmaceutical industry where i work , aerospace companies or even the food industry , all own private information that could be of significant value and potentially accessible for those who know how			0
the highest level of threat represents the potential for state - sponsored attacks and future " cyber warfare " exposing vulnerabilities of our critical national infrastructure to online attack			2
while the nature of this threat landscape is uncertain , the potential damage a cyber-attack could pose to our internet - dependent telecommunications , power and even water infrastructure , has seen cyber security rise sharply up government agendas around the world in the last five years			1
with cyber security a recognized priority at all levels of society , it is not that surprising that employers of this profession such as those i have met through playing the @entity29 are on the lookout for new talent to fill increasing job vacancies			1
however they face their own challenge uncovering people for these jobs			2
our education system in the @entity26 has yet to catch up with a young , rapidly growing and ever - changing industry			1
my it lessons focused on the use of software rather than its development or how to secure it			0
and while there are people who like me developed this knowledge and skills off their own back , there is still limited information out there about cyber security as a career option			1
i always saw it as more of a hobby , or a source of intellectual challenges , but never a genuine job possibility with the potential to progress upwards within a business or organization			1
this has all changed since playing the @entity29 where the excitement of the profession , and the variety and diversity of employers has shown myself and many of the thousands of other @entity29 participants , what this sector could offer them			0
the key is how they have gone about it using realistic and engaging games and exciting problem - solving activities developed by the professions themselves that inspire talented potential recruits to utilize and hone their skills to tackle real - life problems			0
while the @entity29 wo n't solve our recruitment issues on its own it is vital that countries like the @entity26 look outside of the traditional academic pathways if they are to build a healthy pipeline of cyber defenders to protect internet users from those that wish them harm			1
as someone with no formal training in this sector , i know as well as anyone that the skills for the good fight can be in anyone and as a nation we must not ignore this pool of untapped talent if we are to keep the internet a safe place for us all to enjoy			0
the views expressed in this column are solely those of @entity219 .			1

@entity219 is the *reigning* @entity26 cyber security champion
@entity219 : cybercrime has grown exponentially in scale and sophistication in recent years
cybercrime is backed by a highly organized black market and is worth billions of dollars
cyber security is often regarded as hobby for young people rather than " genuine " career
