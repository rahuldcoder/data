-- april 25 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 , @entity6 @entity7 , @entity8 transcript this is a @entity11			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity15 , @entity16 : hey there , everyone			2
happy monday , and thanks for tuning in to @entity0			2
i 'm @entity21 , filling in today for @entity22 , who 's got the day off			1
as we kick off the last week of april , we 're going to get things started today in the @entity25			1
first up : unrest in @entity4 tinker : there 's a deal being discussed in the nation of @entity4 that would remove that country 's president from power			1
that 's something protesters have been pushing for weeks			1
they 've been marching through the streets , demonstrating			2
and in several cases , those demonstrations have turned violent , with fighting between protesters and security forces			2
the protests are centered around this man : president @entity44 , who 's been in power for more than 30 years			1
this deal , which was put together by a group of countries in that region , says that president @entity44 has to step down within 30 days			1
it also gives him and anyone who served in his government complete immunity from prosecution			2
thousands of @entity4 people are angry at the deal , especially because it offers immunity to @entity44			1
they also want him to step down immediately			1
but as of sunday afternoon , president @entity44 had not signed the deal , and government representatives insist he wo n't unless the opposition groups agree to it			1
@entity6 's @entity66 tinker : from @entity4 , we move west to the @entity70 country of @entity6 and the city of @entity5			1
the battle to control that city has gone on now for seven weeks			2
hundreds of people have been killed in the fighting between @entity6 leader @entity77 's forces and the rebels who want him out of power			1
over the weekend , @entity6 officials said they stopped their operations in @entity5 , but a rebel spokesman calls that a flat - out lie			1
@entity0 senior international correspondent @entity84 , who 's been covering the conflict in @entity6 , explains how we got to this point and what some of the potential outcomes might be			1
( begin video ) @entity84 , @entity90 : well , @entity6 's had @entity77 leading the country for almost 42 years , and there 's been a push to see democratic change there			1
although @entity6 is on @entity97 's borders , the revolution in @entity97 really came to its initial conclusion with the ouster of president @entity101 , who took exile in @entity103			1
that really sparked the revolution that then took place in @entity106 , on the other side of @entity6			1
so really , it was these two events , on both sides of @entity6 , that then gave the confidence to the opposition			1
and people want the chance , now , to choose their own political leaders ; to have political parties ; in some cases , to have a voice in their own futures			2
it went from being a sort of an " unarmed civilian against government " situation that we saw in @entity97 and @entity106 , into more of an armed rebel revolt against the government , which is where it is today			1
you have the rebels in @entity133 to the east			2
you have @entity77 in his seat of power and with the support of a lot of the principle tribes of the country in @entity141			2
and you have a siege around the town of @entity5 , where rebels are surrounded by government forces and are being shelled			2
it 's reaching a stalemate of sorts , but behind the scenes , there are political back channel talks that are going on			1
the foreign minister has talked about the possibility of an interim solution , being an interim government that would last for six months before elections			2
but at the same time , @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 are talking about sending advisers for the rebels , which potentially will stiffen positions , stiffen the @entity6 government 's position , and make it harder , potentially , to reach any kind of a deal			1
two potential futures : one is that there is a cease - fire , troops on the ground to monitor a cease - fire , an interim government and , ultimately , elections			2
there 's been a lot of blood - letting so far ; it 's going to be hard to walk away from this situation right now without further bloodshed			1
the other scenario is that both sides dig in deeper , refuse to negotiate , and there becomes a much wider - spread civil war in the country			1
( @entity189 ) @entity190 @entity191 , @entity16 : see if you can i.d. me			2
i 'm a @entity194 city that 's located on the @entity196			1
i was named after a @entity158 king			2
i 'm known as the @entity199 , and i 'm home to the @entity199 i 'm @entity7 , @entity8 , and i was first established in 1764			1
@entity201 tinker : a tornado ripped across parts of @entity7 friday night , and this is what was left behind			1
the twister and fierce winds were estimated at anywhere between 110 to 200 miles per hour			0
this thing damaged 750 homes , left tens of thousands of people without power			0
but incredibly -- thankfully -- there were no reports of any deaths or serious injuries			0
a local minister said " buildings can be replaced , but lives can not			0
" the tornado also hit the airport in @entity7			1
no planes were able to fly out on saturday , but this plane you 're looking at was one of the first to take off on sunday			0
our @entity225 gives us an inside look at the incredible impact this storm had on the airport			1
( begin video ) @entity231 , @entity0 national correspondent : airport security cameras show what it was like inside the moment the tornado struck			1
right now , everything appears fine			0
then the lights go out , debris starts swirling , @entity240 officers run for cover			0
another angle in front of a food stand			0
watch as this guy on a cell phone looks behind him and sees things are not normal			0
seconds later , it appears this whole concourse is swept up by the powerful wind			0
@entity253 : get out ! go back inside ! @entity254 : the aftermath : a scene of broken windows and an airport that has to be quickly shut down			1
one arriving passenger says he saw the wind actually force a plane to slide 20 feet from the gate			0
@entity263 , passenger : by the time we got to the terminal , lights were out , there was glass everywhere , it was just open			0
there was blood everywhere from where people had been cut			0
@entity254 : the tornado ripped through nine separate communities , destroying dozens of homes			1
but amid all the devastation , mostly just minor injuries			0
authorities credit that to people heeding the warnings			0
@entity284 , @entity285 : and that was not only because we had a 34 - minute lead time from the @entity285 , but because our media partners carried that warning immediately to the public , and thirdly , that the public did what we have told them to do			0
@entity254 : still , with so many dislodged from their homes , the @entity293 opened several shelters			0
back at the airport , crews began the tedious process of boarding up windows			1
any glass that had a crack was taken down			0
airport officials say most operations will resume when the power is restored			1
while the airline traffic may resume , the cosmetic damage you see here may take months to repair			0
@entity225 , @entity0 , @entity7			1
( @entity189 ) @entity310 @entity311 , @entity16 : it 's time for the shoutout ! @entity314 marks the end of what religious observance ? if you think you know it , then shout it out ! is it : a ) vespers , @entity325 , c ) @entity324 or @entity328 ) @entity323 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! @entity314 marks the end of the 40 - day period of @entity324			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity333 tinker : in the @entity336 faith , those 40 days of @entity324 are a time for prayer and penance and a time to prepare for @entity314			2
that holiday , of course , was yesterday , as many of the world 's two billion @entity342 celebrated the resurrection of @entity345			2
services and ceremonies took place around the world , including at the @entity350 , led by pope @entity351			0
during his @entity314 blessing , the @entity351 urged an end to the violence in @entity6 and other @entity25 countries			1
and the @entity356 in @entity357 held its annual @entity359 ceremony yesterday			0
it began with a prelude from the @entity362 , and worshippers also heard from the @entity365 chief of chaplains			0
nominate a @entity367 tinker : @entity367 are everyday people who are changing the world			0
but how can you nominate someone to be a @entity367 ? well , it all starts on our home page			0

" that 'll get you to all the information you need			0
nominations are open right now			0
just head to @entity381 to learn all about it			0
before we go tinker : before we go , we want you to check out a truly magical sport			0
although this version is a little more grounded in reality			0
it 's quidditch ! and if that name does n't cause a little bit of a quizzical question for you , you must not be a fan of @entity393			2
the books and movies feature the sport , where contestants fly around on broomsticks			0
this college team just has to hold the broomsticks between their legs			0
@entity402 is quickly -- and not so quietly -- becoming popular on a lot of college campuses			0
goodbye tinker : i guess you could say the high - flying sport is really taking off			0
and i 'd imagine that a win in that battle of the broomsticks would be a sweep victory , indeed			0
time for us to fly			0
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity21 .			0
