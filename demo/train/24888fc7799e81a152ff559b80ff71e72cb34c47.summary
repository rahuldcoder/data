-- @entity1 reclaimed the leader 's yellow jersey at the @entity4 after a bold attack in saturday 's seventh stage gave him his second victory in this year 's 97th edition of cycling 's premier race			1
the @entity11 finished the 165.5 - kilometer leg from @entity13 to @entity14 ahead of @entity16 @entity15 and @entity17 , having burned the reluctant chasing pack in the hot conditions			1
he claimed an overall lead of one minute and 25 seconds over @entity21 , the runner - up in 2007 and 2008 , who finished 14th in the 35 - strong peloton -- who all came home 1:47 behind the @entity26 team rider			1
previous leader @entity27 fell way off the pace as he finished more than 14 minutes behind @entity1 in 84th place , to be 58th overall with a deficit of 13:11			1
defending champion @entity33 was 13th to be sixth overall , 2:27 behind @entity1 , while seven - time winner @entity35 is 3:16 adrift in what is his final attempt at the race			1
@entity41 's @entity40 moved into third place after finishing eighth , while @entity45 's 2009 runner - up @entity46 was fourth overall after coming home in 20th			2
sprint points leader @entity49 finished back in 179th , while his main 2009 rival @entity51 could not follow up friday 's second successive stage win as he placed 161st			2
it was a good day for @entity26 as @entity54 successfully defended his lead in the mountains classification , attacking in the opening kilometer and collecting first - place points at five of the six climbs before falling back to 44th			0
@entity54 lead with 17km to go , but was caught by @entity1 at the foot of the final climb and the 31 - year - old was not caught as the race favorites saved energy ahead of sunday 's eighth stage into the mountains at @entity67			1
" i began to think of the yellow jersey on the last climb , and i told myself that after having lost , it was quite a coup to take it back again , " @entity1 , who also won a crash - marred second stage , told the @entity4 website			1
" tomorrow i will do everything to defend it , but i know that the battle will mainly concern @entity33 , @entity46 and @entity21			0
in the midst of it , i 'll always give everything but if i lose it does not matter			0
" right now i 'm on my little cloud , i 'm floating and i do n't know how else to describe it			0
but i see that i have great support on the road and everywhere			0
" @entity21 said he was happy to let @entity26 attack ahead of a testing stage on sunday			2
" tomorrow is the first day with really big climbs and another mountain - top finish , " he said			0
" it 'll be another day where the main contenders look at each other , test themselves and we 'll see if someone really wants to lay it on the line and blow it apart -- for someone like @entity33 or @entity35 , it 's probably in their interests to try and do that			0
for me it 's a case of see how they go and how i cope			0
