-- president @entity2 and @entity4 candidate @entity3 traded accusations on tax policy thursday , with both claiming at campaign stops in battleground states that the other 's strategies have failed			1
@entity3 used a rally in @entity11 , @entity12 , to unveil a simplified campaign message called for by some @entity4 strategists , laying out a five - point plan that he said would put the nation back on the correct economic path			1
the proposals are traditional conservative stances on domestic energy production , trade , job training , deficit reduction and boosting small businesses , with @entity3 promising that , if elected , he would deliver on them to unleash the full potential of the @entity28 economy			2
" his policies have not worked			0
they have not gotten @entity28 back to work again , " @entity3 said of @entity2 , citing 41 straight months of unemployment over 8 %			1
" i 'm going to get @entity28 working again			0
" in particular , @entity3 challenged @entity2 's call for extending lower tax rates , set to expire at the end of this year , only for income up to $ 250,000 for families or $ 200,000 for individuals , which would allow the rates on income above those marks to increase to 1990s levels			1
calling that plan a tax increase , @entity3 said it would inhibit the job creation needed for economic growth and described the @entity2 policy as being " like a dog trying to chase its tail			1
" in @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity2 attacked @entity3 's call for more tax cuts as an example of long - standing @entity4 policy that was most recently enacted by his predecessor , helping bring the recession that was in place when @entity2 took office			1
" they have tried to sell us tax cut fairy dust before , " @entity2 said			1
" it is not a plan to move our economy forward			0
it takes us backward to a place we do n't need to be			0
" @entity2 blasts @entity3 tax plan in @entity69 the president also made a campaign visit to @entity72 , while @entity3 joined @entity4 governors -- including several potential running mates -- at an @entity76 , @entity12 , conference			1
in a format resembling a celebrity " roast " -- but one with blue blazers and verbal bouquets instead of vulgar put - downs -- the seated governors rose one - by - one to praise @entity3			2
@entity85 gov. @entity84 called @entity3 a man of " fabulous ingenuity " and " great integrity			2
" " we need you , we 're looking forward to your services as president , " said gov. @entity89 of @entity90			0
" i really appreciate your focus on middle class families , " @entity72 gov. @entity95 told @entity3			0
in a hint that @entity3 's decision on a running mate might come soon , his longtime adviser @entity98 , who heads up the campaign 's search for a vice presidential candidate , will be traveling with @entity3 to @entity12			2
polls show that @entity3 and @entity2 are statistically even in @entity12 and @entity72 , while @entity2 holds a small lead in @entity51			1
all three states are among the eight or so considered vital to the chances of both candidates in november			0
the @entity110 reviving the @entity28 dream of equal opportunity has been the central theme of @entity2 's campaign , and @entity3 's new five - point message thursday was an effort to blunt the president 's middle class outreach			1
in general , it rehashes @entity3 's previously stated stances on energy , taxes , deficit reduction , trade and small business development but offers few details for example , the energy component involves easing regulations to expand domestic production of oil , coal and natural gas			0
a conference call by @entity3 's advisers made no mention of alternative sources such as solar or wind energy championed by @entity2 , but @entity3 included continued pursuit of such programs in his later remarks in @entity12			1
the tax component came under heavy criticism from @entity2 , who cited a study by the @entity146 - @entity145 that says @entity3 's proposals would provide large cuts to the very wealthy while increasing the burden on the lower and middle classes			1
@entity151 , a senior @entity3 campaign adviser , called the report " a joke " on thursday 's conference call , while @entity3 economic adviser @entity153 said it fails to include the projected revenue increase from an expanded employment base that @entity3 's policies would bring			1
" eliminating that from your analysis means you 're going to have a very , very biased result , " @entity153 said			0
@entity3 officials also complained that one of the study 's three authors was a former member of @entity2 's @entity168			1
in his @entity51 remarks , @entity2 ridiculed the @entity3 team 's criticism of the report , noting another of the co-authors was an economist in the administration of @entity4 president @entity176			1
" they said ( the report ) did n't take into account the economic growth that would result from tax cuts , " @entity2 said , drawing laughter when he added : " we all know how well that worked the last time they tried it			2
" @entity3 calls for cutting today 's rates by 20 % as well as eliminating the @entity187 and limiting current deductions , exemptions and credits available to top - level income earners			2
however , @entity3 has yet to say which specific tax breaks he plans to eliminate , and the @entity145 report indicated the result of his plan would force the tax burden to shift toward lower - and middle - class @entity28			1
in its study , the @entity145 did not score @entity3 's plan directly , saying it lacked sufficient details			2
instead , the center said the plan represented a number of @entity4 proposals			2
the @entity3 campaign officials said thursday that the specifics of the tax proposal remain to be worked out , with deputy policy director @entity208 adding that @entity3 , if elected , " would write a tax bill that would achieve those goals			1
" " it 's not a question of today we have a 2,000 - page tax plan , " @entity211 said			2
tax policy has become a central economic issue , with @entity218 deadlocked over proposals to extend most or all of the @entity176 - era tax cuts set to expire at the end of the year			0
@entity223 passes @entity4 tax - cut plan @entity3 and @entity4 want to extend all the @entity176 tax cuts for now to prevent any increase , while @entity2 says the lower rates should not continue for the wealthiest 2 % of @entity28 to bring more fairness to the system			1
both sides call for comprehensive tax reform after the election as part of necessary deficit reduction steps			0
the issue touches on the foundations of the nation 's political divide , with republicans driven by their conservative base seeking to shrink government to reduce deficits while @entity243 want a blend of spending cuts and more tax revenue in order to maintain what they consider essential services and entitlement programs			0
with just over three months until the november election , the race has become a contentious struggle to convince voters that the other guy would take the country in the wrong direction			0
in anticipation of @entity2 's @entity51 trip thursday , the @entity3 campaign released a new ad in the state that blames the president for a stalling economy there			1
@entity3 ad hits @entity2 on @entity51 economy @entity51 , currently rated a " toss up " on @entity0 's @entity110 , has been hard hit by a weak housing market			2
its unemployment rate of 8.6 % is higher than the national average , but down from a high of 11.4 % in 2010			0
a @entity275 / @entity274 / @entity273 poll released wednesday showed @entity2 with a 51 % -45 % lead in @entity51 , which has 29 electoral votes			0
another new @entity3 ad wednesday hammered @entity2 over unemployment and other economic problems , saying : " @entity28 need a change			2
we need a new president			0
" campaigns turn to economy ahead of jobs report @entity2 's campaign responded to the ad by citing @entity3 's opposition to the auto industry bailout			1
" let 's get this straight -- the very person who argued for the @entity28 auto industry to go bankrupt , something that would have caused more than a million jobs lost and utter economic devastation in the @entity298 , is now trying to attack the president on how it was handled ? " campaign spokeswoman @entity301 said in a written statement			0
meanwhile , the liberal group @entity303 will run a 30 - second television spot in battleground states mocking the amount of money spent on @entity308 , the dressage horse competing at the @entity310 that is co-owned by @entity3 's wife , @entity311 looking a dressage horse in the mouth the group said the ad to air in @entity317 , @entity69 and @entity318 is told from the perspective of the horse , pointing out that the @entity321 spend $ 77,000 a year for its upkeep			1
" after @entity3 repeals health care and ships your jobs overseas , i daresay your life wo n't be nearly as pampered as mine , " it concludes			0
" after all , you 're not one of his horses			0
" in a statement , @entity303 's executive director said the group was not lampooning the horse itself			0
" there 's nothing wrong with taking good care of a horse , but there 's something messed up about a millionaire who spends twice what most @entity28 make in a year caring for a horse , but wants to take away people 's health care and offshore their jobs , " @entity338 wrote			0
@entity0 's @entity351 , @entity352 , @entity353 and @entity354 contributed to this report .			0
