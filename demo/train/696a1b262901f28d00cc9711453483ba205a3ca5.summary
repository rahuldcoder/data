editor 's note : @entity2 is the author of the best - seller " it 's @entity4 : the @entity6 , @entity7 , liars , and losers who are hurting @entity11			1
" he provides commentary on @entity14 's " @entity13 " daily from 4 p.m. -7 p.m. you can also visit @entity2 's @entity17 blog			1
@entity2 says @entity18 shows virtually no intellectual curiosity , emulating president @entity20 @entity21 ( @entity14 ) -- @entity22 invades @entity23 and president @entity20 goes on vacation			1
our president has spent one - third of his entire two terms in office either at @entity29 , @entity30 , or at @entity31 , @entity32 , on vacation			2
his time away from the @entity35 included the month leading up to 9/11 , when there were signs @entity38 was planning to attack @entity11 , and the time @entity40 destroyed the @entity41			2
sen. @entity18 takes weekends off and limits his campaign events to one a day			1
he made an exception for the religious forum on saturday at @entity46 in @entity47			0
i think he made a big mistake			0
when he was invited last spring to attend a discussion of the role of faith in his life with sens. @entity55 and @entity56 , at @entity57 in @entity58 , @entity18 did n't bother to show up			1
it occurs to me that @entity18 is as intellectually shallow as our current president			1
when asked what his @entity64 faith means to him , his answer was a one - liner			0
" it means i 'm saved and forgiven			0
" great scholars have wrestled with the meaning of faith for centuries			0
@entity18 then retold a story we 've all heard a hundred times about a guard in @entity76 drawing a cross in the sand			1
asked about his greatest moral failure , he cited his first marriage , which ended in divorce			2
while saying it was his greatest moral failing , he offered nothing in the way of explanation			2
why not ? throughout the evening , @entity18 chose to recite portions of his stump speech as answers to the questions he was being asked			1
why ? he has lived 71 years			0
surely he has some thoughts on what it all means that go beyond canned answers culled from the same speech he delivers every day			2
he was asked " if evil exists			0
" his response was to repeat for the umpteenth time that @entity38 is a bad man and he will pursue him to " the gates of hell			0
he was asked to define rich			0
after trying to dodge the question -- his wife is worth a reported $ 100 million -- he finally said he thought an income of $ 5 million was rich			0
one after another , @entity18 's answers were shallow , simplistic , and trite			1
he showed the same intellectual curiosity that @entity20 has -- virtually none			1
where are @entity18 's writings exploring the vexing moral issues of our time ? where are his position papers setting forth his careful consideration of foreign policy , the welfare state , education , @entity11 's moral responsibility in the world , etc. , etc. , etc. ? @entity18 graduated 894th in a class of 899 at the @entity125 at @entity125			1
his father and grandfather were four star admirals in the @entity129			0
some have suggested that might have played a role in @entity18 being admitted			1
his academic record was awful			0
and it shows over and over again whenever @entity18 is called upon to think on his feet			1
he no longer allows reporters unfettered access to him aboard the " @entity138 " for a reason			0
he simply makes too many mistakes			0
unless he 's reciting talking points or reading from notes or a @entity143 , @entity18 is lost			1
he can drop bon mots at a bowling alley or diner -- short glib responses that get a chuckle , but beyond that @entity18 gets in over his head very quickly			2
i am sick and tired of the president of the @entity11 embarrassing me			2
the world we live in is too complex to entrust it to someone else whose idea of intellectual curiosity and grasp of foreign policy issues is to tell us he can look into @entity162 's eyes and see into his soul			1
@entity20 's record as a student , military man , businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure			1
and the part that troubles me most is he seems content with himself			0
he will leave office with the country $ 10 trillion in debt , fighting two wars , our international reputation in shambles , our government cloaked in secrecy and suspicion that his entire presidency has been a litany of broken laws and promises , our citizens ' faith in our own country ripped to shreds			0
yet @entity20 goes bumbling along , grinning and spewing moronic one - liners , as though nobody understands what a colossal failure he has been			2
i fear to the depth of my being that @entity18 is just like him			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .			0
