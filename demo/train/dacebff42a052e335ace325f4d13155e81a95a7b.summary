@entity1 @entity0 return to @entity1 wednesday to prepare for a new era of @entity5 dominance on both sides of the @entity7			1
but first , they have to get through a short , final @entity10 session under @entity12 control			1
the post-election lame duck session should be fast - paced as lawmakers work to clear leftover business , including a must pass bill to fund the government , and other bills to arm @entity20 rebels and extend expiring tax breaks			1
@entity5 leaders are anxious to start the new @entity23 in january with a clean slate when they could control as many as 54 seats			1
senators who were defeated in the last election must return to the @entity7 to vote on these items			0
but newly - elected senators , excited after their victories , ca n't vote until they are sworn - in in january			0
the incoming freshmen will be here for three days of intensive orientation			0
unlike past orientations , when senators were given heavy binders and detailed briefings about foreign policy , national security , and other current topics , this week 's sessions will deal more with the practical matters of operating a @entity10 office , including hiring , disbursement , and ethics rules			1
they will be conducted by individual senators who will share their experiences			0
there will be a special dinner honoring the new members and their spouses wednesday night in the @entity7			0
the incoming members will also be assigned temporary office space for use until they move into their permanent digs sometime next year			0
like an overcrowded elementary school , those offices will be housed in trailers sandwiched into the courtyard of the @entity10 office building			1
while the lame duck agenda is packed , one controversial item the @entity10 may not deal with until next year is approving @entity65 to be the new attorney general			1
@entity12 signaled tuesday they are unlikely to try to confirm her even though if they moved now , they could approve her with just @entity12 votes			1
@entity12 say @entity65 , who has been confirmed twice by the @entity10 , is highly qualified and will be approved regardless of who controls the chamber			1
" there may be some who feel they have to vote no simply because it 's a nominee by president @entity81 , " @entity74 chairman @entity73 , @entity75 , said in an @entity77 interview tuesday			0
" but the vast majority of @entity5 and @entity12 will vote for her			1
" however , most republicans do n't want to rush the process , preferring to explore more carefully @entity65 's background and views on immigration and other hot - button subjects			0
" ms. @entity65 will receive fair consideration by the @entity10			1
and her nomination should be considered in the new @entity23 through regular order , " @entity92 @entity91 warned over the weekend			2
tensions between the parties are already high after a bruising two - year session that was marked by gridlock and partisanship			0
senators are now bracing for president @entity81 to announce controversial executive orders to change immigration laws , which could be released during the lame duck			1
lawmakers and aides are guessing the president will wait until after december 11 , which is when @entity23 needs to clear that critical funding bill to keep government operating			2
@entity5 are vehemently opposed to @entity81 revising immigration laws on his own and have warned that doing so could make it difficult to get anything of consequence done during the lame duck			1
" what the president does over the next two months is really going to set the tone for the next two years in @entity1 , " sen. @entity116 of @entity117 , a member of the @entity5 leadership , said on @entity119			2
" so , i think it would be like the president pulling the pin out of the hand grenade and throwing ( it ) in as we 're actually trying to work together			0
i 'm hoping that cooler heads at the @entity129 prevail			0
" other items @entity10 @entity12 leaders hope to bring to the floor include a package that would extend some personal and business tax breaks set to run out at the end of the year along with the annual @entity137 bill that will likely include extending approval @entity23 already gave for training and equipping @entity20 rebels			1
they will also vote on billions in new funding for the @entity144 outbreak in @entity145 , billions more for the military operations against @entity147 , and possibly an @entity149 reform bill written by the @entity12 chairman of the @entity74 , which would rein in the government 's ability to make bulk collections of phone and @entity156 data			2
however , @entity5 are doubtful this bill will be debated now			0
@entity10 @entity12 leaders are considering a vote on the @entity160 pipeline during the lame duck , according to a source familiar with the issue			1
a decision has n't been finalized but such a move could boost @entity167 @entity12 sen. @entity166 in her run off race			2
@entity92 @entity170 , meanwhile , also has a long list presidential nominations he wants to clear			0
the @entity10 could start debate on authorization of military force to give formal approval for @entity178 military action in @entity20 and @entity179			2
however , aides in both parties said that vote on any new authorization will likely be put off until the new @entity23			2
the @entity178 / @entity185 nuclear talks could also take center stage during the lame duck , as those negotiations hit a critical deadline nov. 24			1
there is bipartisan support in the @entity10 for new sanctions against @entity185 if those talks fail			2
new and returning senators will gather privately thursday morning in the @entity7 to elect new leadership for their respective caucuses			0
there are no major changes expected in the leadership ranks , with sen. @entity91 set to become majority leader and @entity170 set to become minority leader			0
will @entity23 kill an @entity185 nuclear deal ?			0

@entity23 returns to @entity1 wednesday
