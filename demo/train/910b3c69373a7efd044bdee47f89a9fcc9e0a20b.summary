in the 63rd minute @entity2 made the breakthrough , with a goal made in @entity11			2
@entity84 found @entity85 , whose flick found the @entity89 champions ' new signing @entity32 -- and though his first shot was saved , he tucked the rebound home off the underside of the bar			0
@entity95 defender @entity94 nearly made it 2 - 0 soon after but his low shot was brilliantly turned behind by @entity15			2
