@entity0 -- as she began a foot pursuit of a suspect down a dark alley and around a forbidding street corner , @entity0 police officer @entity2 radioed to headquarters that she was heading toward a local gas station			1
" fourteen - 26 , still running towards @entity10 , " @entity2 said as the suspect ignored her commands to stop			1
seconds later , the man wheeled around , grabbed @entity2 and , after a brief struggle , ripped her @entity14 from her hands and charged toward her			1
then he charged the officer who arrived to back up @entity2			1
the second officer wrestled the suspect to the ground and cuffed him , with no injuries to anyone			1
the suspect was charged with two counts of assaulting a police officer			1
if he had chosen to fight the charge in court , he would have had to contend with a piece of evidence only recently available : a videotape of the entire incident			0
the confrontation on february 24 was recorded with a small camera @entity2 was wearing on her head			1
it 's called the axon , manufactured by @entity36 , the same company that makes the widely used stun guns			1
@entity2 is one of 10 @entity0 police officers who have patrolled the streets with the axon camera mounted behind an ear			1
five police departments across the @entity43 are testing the axon and one department -- in @entity45 , @entity46 -- has purchased a set			1
it 's a crucial tool for gathering evidence , said officers who 've used the device			1
they like that it is capable of moving with them where mobile video recorders , so - called " dash cameras " in squad cars , ca n't go			1
they say the camera often pre-empts " he said - she said " disputes in court			1
since the @entity64 began testing them in january , the cameras have recorded several confrontations			1
in another incident in february , an officer ordered a suspect to lie face down after a traffic stop			2
despite repeated commands to show his hands , the suspect did n't respond and appeared to reach toward his pockets			0
officers quickly handcuffed him and discovered he had two pistols			0
on an overnight ride - along with @entity0 officer @entity79 in early april , a @entity1 camera -- and @entity79 ' axon camera -- rolled as a man on a street corner ignored her request to throw away an alcoholic beverage			1
the man ran , and @entity79 , with the @entity1 crew in tow , took off after him			0
after ignoring repeated instructions to stop , the man was tased and arrested for obstructing official business			0
we later reviewed the incident on @entity79 ' portable recorder			0
" what 's your evaluation of how you handled it ? " @entity1 asked			2
" good , i think , " said @entity79			0
" i mean , i gave him every chance to stop running			0
" the axon camera played a pivotal role in a case in @entity102 , @entity103 , in november			1
when cpl. @entity105 responded to a domestic violence call , he was led to the front door of a small one - story house			2
when the door opened , @entity105 saw the suspect sitting at a table , holding a gun			0
despite @entity105 ' repeated commands to drop the weapon , the suspect refused			0
@entity105 fired two shots , killing the man			0
because his warnings -- at least 10 of them -- were recorded , @entity105 was cleared of wrongdoing in an internal investigation			2
but the camera is not without controversy			2
to record an incident , the officer has to double - click a button on a communications hub , a small box mounted in the chest area			1
the video is recorded and stored in a " tactical computer , " a box strapped to the waist			2
all three devices -- the camera , communications hub and tactical computer -- are connected with one wire			2
if the officer does not double - click the communications hub , the incident will not be recorded			1
that means the beat cop has sole discretion over what gets recorded and what does n't			2
" that 's a problem , " said @entity0 criminal defense attorney @entity145			1
" that puts too much bias and prejudice against the person that 's suspected of a crime , or the person that 's being interviewed , or the person that 's being interrogated			2
" @entity0 police chief @entity157 was asked about a theoretical case in which police beat a suspect and make sure among themselves that the scene was not recorded			2
" well in the scenario that you 're talking about right there , no. 1 , i 'd say to you i hope to @entity168 something like that never does happen			0
and if it does happen , i can tell you this : there are some real serious questions that have to be answered			0
and i 'd have to tell you also that peoples ' jobs would be in jeopardy here in @entity0 , " @entity157 said			0
@entity157 has instructed his officers to record every encounter with citizens			0
there are also questions about the chain of evidence captured by axon cameras			1
after an incident is captured and stored in the portable computer carried by the officer , that computer is placed into an electronic panel at headquarters			2
the video is uploaded into a data file in @entity196 called @entity197 , run by @entity36 , where it is stored			0
@entity36 officials said that evidence can not be altered or erased and that police are the only people with access to it			0
no one at @entity206 or @entity14 has that access			1
defense attorney @entity145 said that despite the best intentions of the police departments and @entity14 , the business relationship between those parties has the potential to create conflict			1
" they need to put it in the hands of an independent forensic scientific examiner to make sure it 's out of the hands of the police and outside of the company 's domain , " he said			2
@entity157 said some officers were initially reluctant to wear the cameras			0
" a cop goes into a world that is very mean and down in the gutter and can get downright nasty , and sometimes words are said that we might not use at the dinner tables with our families , " he said			0
" so the cops worry about that kind of thing , and let 's face it , not everyone is an angel here			0
" but @entity157 said that most officers have reconciled with the device			0
" it 's just another tool in the toolbox to help us capture evidence , and that 's what becomes critically important about this			0
and that 's what eventually the cops learn to understand and they learn to accept			0

axon camera , developed by @entity14 , is mounted behind officer 's ear
officer activates camera when a situation in the field is to be recorded
defense attorneys have problems with the officer - activation aspect , storage of recording
5 departments testing cameras , one has bought a set
