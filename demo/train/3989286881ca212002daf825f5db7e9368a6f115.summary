@entity0 -- @entity2 won the 146th @entity3 saturday , denying the heavily favored @entity4 his chance to become the first @entity7 winner in 36 years			1
instead of a historic win by their favorite , the huge crowd at @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity0 , witnessed a dramatic finish in which @entity2 , ridden by @entity15 , overtook @entity16 in his last strides to win by a head			1
but the fact that none of the top three finishers had raced in both the @entity23 and the @entity24 , the two prerequisites to the @entity7 , did n't sit well with @entity4 co-owner @entity25			1
@entity25 angrily told @entity26 that the horse owners that had skipped either race before running the @entity9 took " the coward 's way out			1
" neither @entity2 nor @entity16 ran in the @entity23 or @entity24			1
medal count , the third - place finisher , did n't run in the @entity24			1
@entity4 appeared sluggish and finished in a dead heat for fourth with @entity34 in his bid to become the first @entity7 winner since @entity38 in 1978			2
in the 135 years the grueling series of races for 3 - year - old thoroughbreds have all been contested , only 11 horses have won all three			0
a visibly upset @entity25 said his horse " did n't have it in him			1
" " i 'll never see , and i 'm 61 years old , another @entity7 winner in my lifetime because of the way they do this , " he said			0
" it 's not fair to these horses that have been in the game since @entity53			1
if you do n't make enough points to get into the @entity23 , you [ should n't ] run in the other two races			1
... it 's all or nothing because this is not fair to these horses that have been running their guts out for these people and for the people who believe in them			1
this is a coward 's way out , in my opinion			0
" @entity70 owner @entity69 declined to comment on @entity25 's remarks			1
@entity2 covered the mile and a half in 2:28.52 and returned $ 20.40 to win on a $ 2 bet			2
@entity4 's jockey @entity75 described his horse moments after the race as " a little tired			2
" " turning for home i was just waiting to have the same kick like he always had before , and today he was a little bit flat down the lane , " @entity78 said			0
" i think it was tough for him			0
he ran back - to - back races in different tracks -- and all those fresh horses			0
" @entity15 called his victory bittersweet			0
" i 'm a little bit upset about @entity4 , " he told @entity26			2
" if i was going to get beat , i wanted to just get beat by him			0
" @entity9 has been especially unkind to @entity7 contenders in recent years			0
@entity95 , a prohibitive favorite in 2008 , failed to finish the @entity9 , and in 2012 i 'll have another failed to start , scratched due to an injury			0
the daunting @entity7 challenge squeezes three races into a five - week period , in an era when thoroughbreds normally run no more than once a month			0
adding to the rigor is the course itself : @entity9 is a quarter - mile longer than @entity107 , home of the @entity23 , and five - sixteenths longer than @entity109 , where the @entity24 is run			1
@entity4 started in the second post position -- the same gate that @entity112 shot out from in 1973 on track to @entity7 glory and racing immortality			2
@entity2 was among the horses considered to be @entity4 's biggest threats , along with ride on @entity119 and @entity120			1
the @entity3 prize is about $ 800,000 to the winner , but in the view of some in the thoroughbred racing community , there was much , much more riding on the outcome			0
the beleaguered racing industry , battered for decades by gambling competition and changing entertainment tastes , stood to benefit from a @entity7			0
" if @entity4 wins , " @entity132 , ceo of the @entity133 , said prior to the race , " i think it will bring a whole new generation of fans to this great sport			2
" it was n't to be			0
the people who know the horse : @entity4 's biggest fans @entity4 's jockey ready for another shot at @entity7 @entity143 and @entity1 's @entity144 and @entity145 contributed to this report .			2
