four months ago @entity0 emerged as the runaway winner of the world 's biggest election in history			1
it was a surprising , overwhelming mandate for his @entity6 : no other @entity8 party had won a clear majority in parliament in three decades			1
@entity0 was the clear face of the party , the man millions of @entity8 believed could better their lives			1
but who is @entity0 ? what makes him tick ? how has he evolved in his first role on the national stage ? and what is his vision for @entity8 's foreign policy ? @entity0 has has not done any media interviews since becoming @entity23			1
@entity25 's @entity24 conducted the network 's exclusive interview			1
as part of the @entity25 team that was there at the @entity23 's residence at 7 @entity33 , i got to spend a bit of time observing @entity8 's new , enigmatic , all - powerful leader			1
a lot has been written about @entity0 in the last year			1
what has n't gotten enough press -- a result of the lack of access -- is what @entity43 is like up close			0
here are some thoughts about what i found interesting			0
@entity0 's lighter side @entity0 has a reputation -- at least in the press -- of being a serious man , an intimidating presence			1
having never met him before , i was struck by his lighter side			1
@entity0 had a natural , easy sense of humor , the likes of which i 've rarely seen when producing interviews with world leaders			1
when we were setting up for the interview , i asked him to do an audio test for us			2
" what should i say ? " i asked him to count to ten			0
" you 're testing my primary education as well today ? " the tension broke ; both sides were laughing			0
twenty minutes through the interview , we realized @entity0 's forehead had gotten shiny , perhaps because of the intense lighting			1
i stopped the interview , and asked our makeup artist to touch him up			2
" my sweat is the product of sixty years of toil , my friends , " @entity0 announced to the room			1
" sixty seconds of makeup is n't going to help me ! " again , laughter all round			0
@entity0 was playing to the gallery			1
opinion : memo to @entity0 : how to reboot @entity8 on foreign policy there were serious moments as well			1
one of the things @entity8 - watchers asked when @entity0 was elected was how quickly he would adapt to the global stage			1
@entity0 , after all , had little experience in international diplomacy			1
i 've previously written about how @entity0 has been quick off the block in engaging leaders of other countries			2
what struck me about @entity0 in person was how his foreign policy is rooted not in international relations theory , but in history			1
on @entity101 , @entity0 repeatedly referred to @entity8 's historical ties with @entity101 , and how the two countries had for centuries risen and fallen in sync			1
when asked if he was worried about @entity101 's growing assertiveness in territorial disputes in the @entity101 and @entity108 , @entity0 said : " @entity8 is different			1
it is a country of 1.25 billion people			0
we ca n't run our country if we get worried about every small thing			0
" " at the same time we ca n't close our eyes to problems			0
we 're not living in the 18th century			0
this is an era of partnership			0
everyone will have to seek and extend help mutually			0
@entity101 is also a country with an ancient cultural heritage , " he added			0
@entity0 pointed out how the world had changed since the 18th century			2
back then , countries thought horizontally : they wanted to expand			0
today , they think vertically , about building up their economies			0
certainly , the suggestion @entity0 made was that he was thinking vertically -- and he was expecting his neighbors to do the same			2
opinion : what @entity8 can learn from @entity101 right or left ? journalists often describe @entity0 as a politician of the right			1
he 's pro-business , nationalist , talks about a leaner , smaller government , does n't want to raise taxes			0
indeed , he may be all of those things			0
but perhaps the left - or - right prism is a @entity139 one , best applied to developed economies			0
@entity0 struck me as a populist			2
he candidly talked about growing up poor , about traveling around the country and learning about life from conversations with regular people			1
he defended @entity8 's policy on subsidies			1
for rich countries , subsidies are a political agenda , he said			2
" for poor countries , subsidies are a matter of life or death			2
" @entity0 explained he was not going to budge on bringing in @entity154 ( @entity155 ) in retail ( a change many economists have called for ) because he believed in a different kind of @entity154 -- first develop @entity8			1
work at the start of our interview , @entity0 told us about his working life			1
he said he wakes up at 5 a.m. every morning -- a childhood routine -- and often stays up working and reading until anywhere from 10pm to two in the morning			0
so , how does he unwind , asked @entity24			0
@entity0 used an analogy of a scientist obsessed with his laboratory ; his passion keeps him in the lab all day and all night			2
that , @entity0 said , was how he felt about governance			2
" work gives me relaxation too ... i draw pleasure in governance , in doing new things and bringing people together			0
that pleasure is all i need from life			0
" rhetoric one thing i was n't surprised by was @entity0 's rhetoric			2
up close , his speech and rhetoric are as impressive as it had seemed to be on the campaign trail and on tv			0
he had clearly prepared thoroughly for questions he thought an international broadcaster might ask			0
he knew the right things to say -- even off camera			0
but great rhetoric also means great expectations			0
it 's too soon to judge @entity0 on results			2
for sure , @entity25 will be back later to ask and check if he has delivered .			2

@entity25 granted first interview with @entity0 since he became @entity8 pm
@entity0 has a reputation for being an intimidating presence but showed a lighter side
foreign policy seemed to be rooted in history , not international relations theory
he candidly talked about growing up poor and defended @entity8 subsidies
