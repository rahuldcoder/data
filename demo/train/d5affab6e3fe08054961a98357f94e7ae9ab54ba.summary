no two ways about it			0
thirty years ago , when i was a kid , you could get into the @entity6 for just $ 18			0
now , tickets cost $ 99 and up			0
but if you want to take the plunge , you might find that a few splurges are worth it			0
if you can splurge a bit on the luxury details , you 'll get the luxury benefits , which can really pay off			1
to @entity14 or not to @entity14 ? check in , stay in it 's long been the advice of every @entity14 travel guru on the planet that staying at a @entity1 property improves your trip a thousand-fold			0
you get early access to the parks and easy transportation there , plus you 're eating and breathing @entity14 24/7 , that wraparound experience that really makes it feel like vacation			0
wan na go the extra step ? check out @entity1 's newest on - site hotel , the @entity29 @entity28			1
opened in august , the gorgeous property blends @entity29 luxury style and service with @entity14 fun			1
rooms start at $ 545 , pricey but only a small jump from other luxury @entity14 properties , and you 're getting a much fancier room and hotel			2
plus , the @entity29 hotel has arguably the coolest swimming pool complex in the resort			1
forget paying extra for the water parks			0
as a guest of the @entity29 , you can take full , and free , advantage of a family pool , a castle - like kiddie pool with shooting jets of water and other surprises , an 11,000 - square - foot lazy river , two water slides and an adult pool			1
there 's also a supervised kid 's club open every day from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. , with a clubhouse , well - thought - out games and activities and almost more staff than kids			2
my 6 - year - old tried out the kids ' program and did n't want to leave			2
and it 's free with your stay at the @entity29			1
book a stay before december 19 , and you get your third night free			0
the most insane new @entity74 roller coasters take advantage of valet parking maybe you ca n't spring for the @entity29 or another luxury @entity14 hotel			1
but that does n't mean you ca n't sample some of their offerings			0
if you have a car , you can book a massage at the glorious @entity85 hotel ( where room rates start at $ 488 per night ) or maybe even a reservation for the resort 's princess tea party			0
it costs $ 20 to park for the day with the valet , and then you get the treat you book , plus you can wander around the lush hotel property and enjoy its other wonders			2
monorail , kids ? for another window into @entity14 luxe experiences , you might try dining at @entity102 's high - end bluezoo restaurant at the @entity103 and then check out the rest of the joint , which is near @entity106 and @entity107 ( plus , @entity108 and @entity110 hotel restaurants will validate your parking , making that part free )			2
@entity114 's top 25 amusement parks take a private @entity116 tour the cost of @entity1 is even more exasperating when you realize you 've paid all that money just to wait in line for rides			1
the always - improving fastpass + system helps , allowing you to make reservations for up to three rides per day			2
but who wants to go on just three rides ? paying for a @entity1 vip tour gives you all kinds of perks : door - to - door transportation from your hotel , preferred seating during select entertainment options and parades , and most important , what amounts to unlimited fastpass + entries onto rides			1
want to go on @entity139 six times ? in a row ? at the height of the season ? well , you can do it with a vip tour			1
the various @entity147 tour options start around $ 299 per person			0
but look at it this way : you could pay for theme park tickets for three days ( i.e. , $ 300 - plus a person ) to go on only nine fastpass + rides ( plus wait in interminable lines for whatever else you choose )			1
or for roughly the same amount of money , you could buy a ticket for just one day and , for instance , pay for the " @entity159 " a group experience with a @entity161 tour guide , lunch at a table - service restaurant included plus automatic fastpass + admission to 11 of the most exhilarating rides across three @entity1 parks			1
@entity168 also has great @entity116 tour offerings , starting around $ 229 per person			0
in addition to priority entrance to rides , my family enjoyed having a knowledgeable guide walking us through the park , showing my daughter exactly how to use her wand in @entity181 , for instance , or how we could meet the minions without going on the @entity184 ride			1

the @entity29 @entity28 offers a new level of luxury
it may be *difficult* to lure kids away from the *expansive* pool complex
a vip park tour means *breezing* through lines for as many rides as you can fit in
