@entity1 , @entity0 -- animal rights campaigners were holding a meeting tuesday with @entity6 's @entity5 to argue against the use of bearskin in the iconic furry headgear worn by royal guards at @entity11			1
a @entity15 activist in @entity16 , @entity17 earlier this year protests against @entity6 troops wearing bearskin hats			2
@entity20 , @entity21 director for @entity15 ( @entity15 ) , was meeting with @entity22 , the minister for defense equipment and support , the defense ministry said			1
" we are hoping that they will switch to a humane synthetic alternative , " a @entity15 spokeswoman said			0
@entity15 has been campaigning for years against the use of bearskin in the headgear , a familiar symbol of @entity1 worn by the guards who keep watch over royal buildings like @entity11 and @entity35			1
the hats are part of the @entity39 ' ceremonial dress , along with the bright red jackets			0
@entity15 says the bears used to produce the fur hats are killed cruelly and unnecessarily			0
" it 's an absolute moral disgrace , " said @entity43 , a @entity6 lawmaker who has joined @entity15 's campaign against the bearskins			0
" i do n't think the @entity6 public or tourists will mind if it 's synthetic fur , and i 'm absolutely amazed in this day and age that we see beautiful animals skinned and killed " to produce the hats			0
a spokesman for the @entity56 in @entity1 , @entity57 , said the fur comes only from @entity60 bears that have died naturally , and that no bears are killed for the hats			1
campaigners say they still want the defense ministry to use a different material			1
" it still promotes the usage of animal fur in areas where it 's totally unnecessary , in my view , for fur to be used , " said @entity66 , another @entity6 lawmaker opposed to the use of the fur			2
the @entity76 's use of the bearskin hats dates back to the @entity78 on in 1815 , when @entity80 's army defeated the @entity81 in a victory that marked @entity84 's downfall			1
the @entity6 soldiers captured the headgear from the defeated @entity87 and have worn them ever since , although today the hats are only worn for ceremonial duties			2
those @entity6 soldiers were renamed the @entity91 to honor their defeat of the @entity93 of the @entity94			0
the @entity93 are now among five bearskin - wearing regiments that guard @entity6 royal buildings			1
but each bearskin hat is heavy and can prove very hot for the wearer			0
" there have been occasions where soldiers have suffered from heatstroke , because obviously wearing that much fur on your head ... can get quite warm , " @entity57 said .			0
