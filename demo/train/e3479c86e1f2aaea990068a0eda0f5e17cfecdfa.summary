-- everything you know about the world of @entity5 's most famous character has changed			1
@entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 star in " terminator : the @entity11			1
" in the season finale of " terminator : the @entity11 , " @entity13 , the boy destined to lead humanity 's battle against @entity16 , gets jolted into the future -- the one he was supposed to lead			1
but here , he has no identity			0
no one has heard of him			0
in this new future , he 'll be fighting alongside his father , his uncle and a girl who looks just like the robot he came into the future to save			2
none of them has any idea who he is			0
confused ? do n't be			0
it was a daring , surprising , brilliant cliffhanger for a show that 's gained a loyal following , particularly among people like me who are in awe of it			1
it also opens the door to anyone who has n't discovered this show yet , allowing for a fresh start			2
unfortunately , it may be too late			0
for fans , the big question is whether the " chronicles " will be back , or canceled for inadequate ratings			0
we find out in a couple of weeks when @entity49 announces its schedule			1
the speculation online does n't look good			0
ending on this @entity53 cliffhanger would be a shame			0
when @entity49 picked up this " @entity56 , " it took on one of the most successful sci - fi franchises in modern entertainment history			1
it courted " @entity56 " fans , as well as people like me who never gave much thought to the movies but appreciate deep , high - quality tv storytelling			1
ending on this " what happens now " cliffhanger would leave a gaping hole in the franchise 's history			2
but of bigger concern , of course , is that " the @entity11 " is just really good tv -- the kind that you want to believe can last			1
and that 's thanks to @entity78 , the inspired executive producer			2
for him , " @entity56 " is n't about special effects and metal monsters			0
it 's a family drama ; a mother and son entrusted with a huge secret and the responsibility to change the future , no matter what the cost			1
without clobbering you with messages , @entity78 gets you thinking -- about people whose secret struggles you ca n't know , about living with trauma and moving forward , about the strength and fragility of teenagers , and about the otherwise impossible things parents manage to do to protect their children			0
@entity100 is parental adrenaline personified			0
it 's also a show about cancer			1
we know @entity100 can successfully battle robots , evil people and well - meaning authorities who want her locked up			2
but will cancer ultimately do her in ? @entity78 has talked about the show serving as a catharsis for his own real - life battle against cancer			1
fans ca n't wait to find out what happens with @entity100 ( @entity8 ) in the new reality			0
did she follow her son into the future ? if not , what happened to her ? @entity78 might be the best storyteller on tv right now			1
he packs episodes with twists you do n't see coming but make sense in retrospect			0
he changes up his style , drops lead characters for entire episodes , uses biblical references left and right and delivers dialogue that 's simultaneously believable and eloquent			2
he lets major characters die			0
and the show 's directors coax subtle , nuanced performances from the actors			1
you would n't guess any of this from @entity49 's promotions , which have focused too heavily on @entity141 ( @entity9 ) , the robot who helps protect @entity13 ( @entity7 ) , sending the signal that it 's a show just for teenage fanboys			1
@entity141 and @entity13 's relationship is actually a very clever exploration of something adults quickly recognize : the teenage boy with the mysterious girl who seems to have his best interest at heart but might be the most dangerous thing in his life			2
it 's in some ways the reverse of " @entity158			2
" speaking of which , @entity49 may have done better promoting " chronicles " as a family drama and then pairing it with one , rather than " @entity162 , " the latest from " @entity158 " creator @entity163			1
( insider question for fans : is @entity78 the new @entity163 ? weigh in here or here			0
) it 's also not clear how , or if , the new movie " terminator : @entity179 " affects the show 's chances of survival -- though strictly in terms of storylines , there 's apparently no overlap and no conflict			1
the weekly adventures of @entity100 and @entity13 just are n't done			0
there 's too much unanswered , too much left to explore			2
so here 's my pitch to network heads : you can still change the future			1
do n't terminate these " chronicles " before their time			0
what are your thoughts ? think @entity78 is right -- or misguided ? weigh in at @entity194 or @entity195 .			0

future of " terminator : the @entity11 " is up in the air
@entity0 's @entity200 believes show is one of best on tv and is taking interesting turns
@entity206 : @entity49 has *misplaced* promotion , which should be focusing on mother - son bond
