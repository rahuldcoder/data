@entity0 -- an entire class of statin drugs will get new labels that alert the public to safety concerns , the @entity2 announced tuesday			1
statins , which treat cholesterol , now will come with labels that include a warning that the drugs , taken by almost 32 million @entity13 , can cause memory loss and confusion			1
the @entity2 says reports in general have not been serious , and the symptoms subsided when patients stopped taking the medications			0
the new labeling will also warn doctors and patients that statins can cause hyperglycemia , an increase in blood sugar levels and increase the risk of type 2 diabetes			1
the @entity2 will no longer recommend routine and periodic monitoring of liver enzymes of patients taking statins			2
instead , it said liver enzyme tests should be performed before a patient starts taking statins , and then only when clinically indicated			2
that 's because according to the @entity2 , serious injury to the liver is rare , and routine monitoring does n't detect or prevent it			0
the new label will tell patients who experience fatigue , loss of appetite , dark urine , upper stomach pain or jaundice to notify their doctor immediately			2
there also will be a label change specific to lovastatin ( @entity51 )			0
certain medicines interact with this particular statin , increasing the risk of myopathy , or muscle damage			2
the agency says some drugs should never be taken with @entity51 including protease inhibitors , a class of @entity62 drugs and certain drugs used to treat bacterial and fungal infections			2
" we want healthcare professionals and patients to have the most current information on the risks of statins , but also to assure them that these medications continue to provide an important health benefit of lowering cholesterol , " said dr. @entity65 , in the @entity2 's @entity66			1
statins are used to prevent and treat atherosclerosis , the build up of plaque on the inside of blood vessels causing them to become thick and hard			1
the result can be heart attacks and stroke			0
statins help lower low - density lipoprotein cholesterol , or " bad " cholesterol			1
the products that will have these label changes include @entity91 ( atorvastatin ) , @entity51 ( lovastatin ) , @entity94 ( rosuvastatin ) and @entity96 ( simvastatin )			0
labels for combination statin products like @entity51 , @entity100 and @entity101 will also change			0
in a statement , @entity102 , maker of @entity91 , one of the top - selling prescription drugs in the world told @entity1 : " the announcement today by the @entity2 provides additional information to physicians and patients regarding statins including @entity91 ( atorvastatin calcium )			1
the class labeling is based on @entity2 evaluation of all statin labels , entry of new interacting drugs on the market , and a review of clinical data and post marketing reports			1
lipitor has been supported by a wealth of clinical research and real - world experience and has been studied in more than 400 ongoing or completed trials , including more than 80,000 patients and is backed by more than 19 years of clinical experience and more than 200 million patient - years of experience			0
" @entity129 , deputy director for safety in the @entity2 's @entity131 , says the agency looked at the adverse events reported to determine the scope of the problem			0
they ca n't say what caused the memory loss and confusion , but it seems to be a class effect and a rare event			1
" when we looked at these reports they ran the gamut -- memory loss , memory impairment , confusion -- and they were occurring anywhere from one day after initiation of the statin to years after initiation			1
" we could not identify if it was age specific because it was across a range of age groups			0
we did not see it occurring as a drug interaction , where patients were also taking other medications that were reacting with the statin to cause the confusional state			0
but we really want to get the message out there that we do not consider this a major problem , and certainly it does not outweigh the tremendous benefits of statin therapy			0
" @entity172 , director of the @entity173 at @entity174 in @entity0 , says the new changes are a real step forward			0
he says the concern over an increased risk of diabetes is valid but not a reason to shun statins			1
" the diabetic has a significant increased risk for heart disease , and the most clearly demonstrated therapy that will affect that is to control their cholesterol and their blood pressure , " @entity172 said			1
" statins are very important in diabetics to reduce their risk of heart attack and stroke			2
so the benefit they will receive in that reduction in risk far outweighs the risk of developing diabetes			2
it 's a small risk , but it 's a lot of people			0

nearly 32 million @entity13 take statins , a cholesterol drug
labels will warn of hyperglycemia , increased blood sugar , risk of @entity212 diabetes
the drugs may also cause memory loss and confusion
