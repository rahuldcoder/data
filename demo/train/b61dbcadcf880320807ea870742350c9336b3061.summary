-- the latest mobile phone user survey from market research firm @entity2 reveals similar levels of overall satisfaction between @entity6 users on @entity7 versus those on @entity9			1
however , @entity6 users seem to suffer from dropped calls far less often than their @entity9 peers , supporting early anecdotal evidence from @entity6 users			2
" in terms of overall satisfaction the two iphones are virtually indistinguishable , " according to @entity2 vice president of research @entity18			0
in march , 82 percent of @entity6 users reported being very satisfied with the device , while 80 percent of @entity23 users reported the same			2
only two percent reported any dissatisfaction with the device on either carrier			0
half of @entity7 smartphone users mulling switch to @entity6 that does n't mean users on @entity7 do n't see at least one significant benefit : fewer dropped calls			1
@entity6 users reported a dropped call rate of 1.8 percent			2
@entity37 users , in contrast , had a dropped call rate of 4.8 percent -- more than double that of @entity6 users			0
that difference is n't limited to @entity15 , though			0
comparing dropped call rates for all mobile users on all four carriers , @entity7 users reported just 1.4 percent of calls were dropped unexpectedly , while @entity9 users reported a 4.6 percent rate			1
@entity47 and @entity48 users reported rates of 2.3 percent and 2.7 percent respectively			0
16 % of @entity9 customers ready to jump ship for @entity6 a look at @entity2 's historical data suggests that @entity9 is actually improving			0
at the height of the @entity6 release , @entity9 users were reporting dropped call rates as high as 6 percent -- the highest rate recorded by @entity2 's survey since tracking began in 2008			1
at the same time , however , @entity7 has also been improving			0
the 1.4 percent rate is the lowest recorded since 2008			2
while our own testing did n't reveal much of a difference in dropped calls , @entity2 's results jibe with the accepted dogma about using an @entity6 on @entity7 versus @entity9 -- namely , that dropped calls were much less of a problem			1
if voice calls are a primary reason you use a smartphone , @entity7 is likely to be a better choice if you do n't want your calls to unexpectedly cut themselves short			1

@entity7 users reported just 1.4 percent of calls were dropped unexpectedly
while @entity9 users reported a 4.6 percent rate of dropped calls
if voice calls are a primary reason you use a smartphone , @entity7 is probably a better choice
