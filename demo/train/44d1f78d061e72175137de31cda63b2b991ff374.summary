@entity3 fishermen rounded up more than 250 bottlenose dolphins in a secluded cove to kill for meat or sell into a lifetime of captivity , @entity1 conservationists warned			1
the annual hunting of dolphins at @entity11 highlights the rift between conservationists worldwide who see it as a bloody slaughter and @entity3 who defend it as a local custom			1
the @entity19 first raised the alarm over the plight of the dolphins friday , saying five separate pods of bottlenose dolphins had been " driven into @entity11 's infamous killing cove			1
" the group warned that the dolphins would " face a violent and stressful captive selection process			0
babies and mothers will be torn from each other 's sides as some are taken for captivity , some are killed , and others are driven back out to sea to fend for themselves			2
" by the end of saturday , 25 dolphins had been removed from their pod and taken " to a lifetime of imprisonment , " the group said			0
one of them died in the process and will be butchered , it said			0
the dolphins will be kept penned in the cove for another night before the selection process begins again sunday			0
' panicked , frightened and fatigued ' the @entity19 live - streamed video of events in the cove saturday and posted frequent updates on @entity53			0
" killers continue to ruthlessly wrap bottlenose dolphins into nets and drag them to the shore for selection , " one update said			1
another , a few minutes later , said , " panicked , frightened , and fatigued , another portion of the bottlenose pod is driven closer to the shore			0
" " killers and trainers tore half of the pod apart today , and will finish tomorrow , " was the final post on the day 's hunt			0

" @entity76 was unable to reach anyone at the town office for @entity11 , a community of about 3,000 that juts into the @entity80 , or the local fishermen 's union for comment			1
but local officials have reacted angrily in the past to @entity87 criticism of what they say is a traditional practice dating back centuries			1
officials say criticism is biased , unfair a 2009 @entity94 - nominated documentary film , " @entity95 , " brought the issue of dolphin hunting in @entity11 to the fore with bloody scenes of dolphin slaughter			1
the @entity101 , where @entity11 is , condemned the film in an online response as distorted , biased and unfair to the fishermen			2
" the @entity11 dolphin fishery has been a target of repeated psychological harassment and interference by aggressive foreign animal protection organizations , " it said			0

therefore , we believe there are no reasons to criticize the @entity11 dolphin fishery			0
" the @entity3 practice of whale hunting has also put it in conflict with the views of much of the world			2
