fortunately , she survived after nine hours in surgery			0
@entity9 is now under arrest			0

why have doctors become victims of violence ? some 55.6 % of respondents said the society is simply prejudiced against the medical profession , 23.5 % of doctors did not properly communicate with their patients and 20.6 % said treatment can not meet patients ' high expectations			2
in the early 1980s , as part of @entity101 's reform and open - door program , @entity2 extended its market reforms to health care			1
hospitals were stripped of government subsidies and forced to become financially self - supporting			0
the assumption was the market would move in and take care of the problems			0
since then , however , @entity2 's health care system has fallen behind the country 's rapid socio - economic growth			1

@entity2 blogger " @entity155 " observed : " we 've heard it so many times that if a patient does not bribe his doctor , there is high probability that his surgery would not be successful			1
it 's also a common knowledge that even patients who had given bribes still worry if they gave enough bribes			0
with such severe anxiety added to their painful illness , even the normally failed surgery would be deemed abnormal			0
" doctors and would - be doctors complain that the burden of proof is one - sidedly put on their side			2
" only @entity2 adopts a ' reverse onus ' principle in dealing with doctor - patient disputes , which assumes that doctors are guilty and are asked for evidence to prove their innocence , " said @entity176 , a resident at the @entity177			1
" this is quite ironic			0
" " of course , overburdened case - loads and relatively low official pay may actually contribute to practitioners unmotivated to show compassion , but there is also a sense of entitlement on the part of patients , " added the @entity55 consultant			1
@entity2 is now considering administrative and legal mechanisms to deal with doctor - patient disputes			1
meanwhile , observers say the situation is demoralizing doctors and doctors - in - training , prompting a kind of brain drain			2
" that is partially why some talent are going abroad and some are defecting to become pharmaceutical and device sales people , " said the consultant			0

" @entity176 , who is in his final year at @entity214 's medical school , says he will stick to his medical career			0
