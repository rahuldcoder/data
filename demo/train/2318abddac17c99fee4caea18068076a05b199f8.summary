as president and editor - in - chief of @entity3 , you would expect @entity4 to be living her life at 100 mph			1
not so , she says ( although she is often spotted running from event to event gripping multiple smartphones while tweeting at the same time )			2
in fact , @entity4 , founder of the @entity10 , is on a mission to persuade us all to slow down			1
she describes herself as a " sleep evangelist , " has nap rooms in her offices at the @entity18 headquarters in @entity19 and tries to start every day with meditation			1
" i 've been meditating for years but now i 'm increasingly making it part of my daily routine , " she said			1
in fact , she jokingly says she slept her way to the top			2
" there is that special glow after a good night 's sleep when you feel really in the zone			1
you feel like ' bring it on -- you know i can handle anything ! ' " @entity36 : whose words inspire you ? for a woman so successful , it is of course a mission with a business opportunity			2
the @entity3 has a new " @entity44 " lifestyle section and the company recently launched an @entity47 app called " @entity48 , " at the @entity49 in @entity50			1

" i started with wanting to create a site that was incredibly engaging , " said @entity4			1
" and the timing was great , i loved my work , working hard does n't feel like drudgery			2
" and then i think we made some really smart moves , the acquisition was an incredibly smart move , moving internationally was really the right moment			2
" @entity4 was born in @entity86 , @entity87 , ( she jokingly calls herself a " @entity87 peasant girl " ) and moved to the @entity89 at age 16 , winning a place at @entity92 to study economics			1
" my mother would tell me from a very young age never to be afraid of failing , " she said			2

trying to get into @entity92 when everybody said you 'll never get in , or writing my first book when i was 23			0
" a lot of things that were likely to fail and many did fail			0
i mean my first book did well , my second book was rejected by 36 publishers			0

her advice ? embrace failure , she said			0

in the @entity89 having a foreign accent at the time especially was still seen as really alien			0

i was determined to learn to speak			0
" @entity4 moved to the @entity127 in 1980 , where she found her accent was more easily accepted			1

in 2003 , she stood against @entity139 as an independent candidate for governor of @entity142			0
she rejects political definitions of left and right ( although she is widely viewed as a staunch liberal these days ) , but has plenty of advice for president @entity148			0
" for me the biggest crisis that 's not being addressed at the moment in @entity151 is youth unemployment			2
" it 's the fact that 50 % of college graduates either ca n't get a job or are doing a job for which they would n't have needed a college degree			2
" that 's not sustainable			2
that really goes against the @entity161 , which is based on the assumption that you work hard , you play by the rules and then you do well			0
" @entity4 is divorced with two daughters in their 20s			1
her biggest hope for her daughters ' generation is that they will feel less pressure			0

" one of the advantages of growing older is that you stop looking over your shoulder , you stop feeling that pressure			0
" my only hope for younger women like my daughters is why not feel that earlier			0
