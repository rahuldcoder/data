@entity0 , @entity1 -- the verdict so far : generally good news but still some uncertainty about whether there 's a leak in @entity9 's well in the @entity10 , now fitted with a containment cap			1
that 's the assessment of the retired @entity17 admiral overseeing the government 's response to the oil spill , more than 24 hours into a critical test checking the well 's ability to hold up under pressure			1
@entity21 reported friday afternoon that pressure is rising in the well , a sign that the well is holding and that the leak that had been spewing oil into the @entity10 for nearly three months can be contained			1
but pressure readings have not reached the optimal level			1
pressure was up to 6,700 pounds per square inch inside the well 's capping stack , he said			1
more than a day into the " well integrity " test , pressure above 7,500 pounds per square inch would indicate " high integrity and low potential for a leak , " according to @entity21			1
what does 6,700 pounds per square inch mean ? government scientists and @entity9 experts are n't quite sure			1
it could be a leak , or it could simply be that so much oil has spilled out already , it 's taking a while to build up pressure			1
" in general , as the president noted today , this is generally good news , " @entity21 said			2
but he added , " i think we 're at a point where there 's enough uncertainty about the meaning of the pressure that we 're seeing that we have to use due diligence moving forward			1
we do n't want to do harm or create a situation that can not be reversed			2
" @entity21 said the government has told @entity9 to proceed with the test but intensify monitoring of the well , by conducting seismic and acoustic tests and visual inspections of the sea floor using robots			1
in addition , a government ship is in the area , fitted with equipment for detecting methane gas , which would be an indication of a leak			1
the " well integrity test " began thursday after two days of delays , first as government scientists scrutinized testing procedures and then as @entity9 replaced a leaking piece of equipment known as a choke line			1
the oil stopped gushing out thursday afternoon , the first time @entity9 has been able to gain control since the @entity78 rig exploded april 20 and triggered the catastrophe			1
all that was made possible by a new , tightly fitting containment cap			2
@entity9 senior vice president @entity83 said later in a telephone conference following @entity21 's that two robots trolling the sea floor in the area of the well bore and two others capturing sonar data have not detected any breaching			1
" at this point , there is no evidence the well bore has been breached , so that 's good news , " he said			2
" the current monitoring that we do shows no negative evidence			2
" he said the well integrity test is proceeding as planned , and the pressure readings so far , while not optimal , are " consistent with @entity9 's engineering analysis " and " do not give us any indication that we do not have well integrity			1
" @entity83 said also said that work restarted friday on the drilling of the first of two relief wells , seen as a more permanent way to plug and seal the breached well			2
they 're expected to be completed in august			0
one serves as a backup to the other			0
when they are ready , mud and cement will be pumped into one of the relief wells to permanently seal @entity9 's crippled well			1
@entity21 and @entity9 officials initially had said that the test results would be closely scrutinized at six - hour intervals and that the integrity test could go on for 48 hours			1
but at this point , they 're focusing on each six hours , with no guarantee the test will last two days			0
when the test is wrapped up , valves are expected to be reopened to resume siphoning oil to two ships on the surface , the @entity130 and @entity131 , as government and @entity9 officials assess the data and decide what to do next			1
two more ships are due to join them in coming weeks , bringing containment capacity to 80,000 barrels ( about 3.4 million gallons ) of oil a day , more than high - end estimates of how much oil had been leaking			2
but it 's possible some oil may be released into the @entity10 again , before all the ships are ready			0
as results came in friday morning , president @entity143 spoke about the developments with a note of caution			0
" i think it 's important that we do n't get ahead of ourselves here , " he said			2
" you know , one of the problems with having this camera down there is that when the oil stops gushing , everybody feels like we 're done , and we 're not			0
we wo n't be done until we actually know that we killed the well and have a permanent solution in place			2
" the president expects to return to the @entity161 in the next few weeks			0
the @entity162 announced that first lady @entity163 will return to the @entity164 next week to meet with @entity17 personnel who 've been responding to the oil spill and to christen a coast guard cutter named in honor of @entity169 , the service branch 's first female commissioned officer			0
the visit will take place in @entity173 on friday			0
meanwhile , @entity10 residents are happy simply that no oil is being released now			0
" see the smile ? that 's my reaction , " @entity177 said			0
" but it 's cautious optimism			0
obviously , i 'm very happy			0
it 's been our goal for 88 days now			0
it 's been a long run			0
but , hopefully , we get it done right and begin the cleaning			0
that 's the most important part			0
let 's clean up and get our fishermen back to work			0
" @entity9 also reported that it has paid more than $ 200 million in claims to 32,000 @entity161 residents			1
the largest groups of claimants include fishermen , who have received $ 32 million , and shrimpers , who have received $ 18 million , the company said in a news release			0
it said that about $ 77 million has been paid for loss of income to workers on ships , at seafood processing plants and other businesses			0

new : @entity9 official : no indication we do n't have well integrity
" well integrity " testing proceeds past 24 - hour mark
pressure is still not at optimal level
government tells @entity9 to step up monitoring
