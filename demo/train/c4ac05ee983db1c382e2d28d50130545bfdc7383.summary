-- over the past couple of days , i 've listened with mounting frustration as people debate whether @entity5 should remove from its campus the 900 - pound bronze statue of @entity8 , its once - legendary football coach			1
it 's as if , to the folks who demand action , taking away a metal @entity8 would serve as another blow to the real @entity8 ; one last spear in the heart of the fallen hero who apparently looked elsewhere as @entity13 , his longtime assistant coach and friend , molested one child after another			1
sadly , it just does n't work that way			2
as much as i have come to abhor @entity8 's indifference and arrogance and self - serving loyalty ( to himself and his image and his stupid little football program ) , i fail to see how digging out a statue does anything but conflict with ( what should be ) one of the most important elements of higher education : open and honest and intelligent dialogue			1
were i in command of this decision , not only would i make certain the statue stays , i 'd surround it with flood lights and fireworks and hire @entity41 to hype its very presence			2
" come one , come all ! @entity44 out ! bring classmates ! observe the bronze @entity8 ! debate away ! " truth be told , the last thing we ( and @entity5 ) should be doing right now is trying to hide and forget what happened			1
bronze @entity8 needs to remain , because we need to talk about this			1
we need to discuss ways to stop child abuse			0
we need to discuss the courage it takes to step forward , especially when it 's significantly easier to remain silent			2
we need to discuss the goals of college			0
mostly , we need to discuss statues themselves -- and what they reflect			0
the reason @entity13 was able to perpetrate his evil is because at @entity5 ( as at hundreds of other @entity68 schools across @entity69 ) sports have exceeded academics in importance			1
the athletic programs are responsible for large dollars ; for large enrollments ; for national attention ; for eternal glory			0
they are not to be stopped or interfered with or questioned			0
university : @entity8 statue to be removed @entity8 has a statue for the same reason @entity81 built one for former quarterback @entity82 ( a non-graduate who attended the school for one year ) -- because football ( literally , the launching of a synthetic oval contraption through the air ) exceeds all else			1
why , in 2007 , five @entity5 scientists ( @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 ) shared the @entity94 for their work on climate change issues			2
none of them have statues ( rest assured , had any committed @entity13 - like acts , they would have been turned over to the authorities in minutes )			0
none of them will have statues			0
bronze @entity8 needs to stay because , deep within his metallic eyeballs , there is a story to be told			1
years and years from now , when most of us are gone and this scandal is merely a blip in history , he will hopefully serve as the essential reminder that , once upon a time , we deified people for their ability to win ultimately meaningless and trivial games			0
and we paid a dear price for doing so			0
