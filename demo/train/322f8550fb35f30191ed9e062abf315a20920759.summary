-- centuries from @entity2 and @entity3 helped @entity6 defeat @entity4 by seven wickets in the fourth one - day international in @entity9 to take an unassailable 3 - 1 lead in the five - match series			1
@entity12 had hit a superb 118 and @entity13 made a fine 60 as the visitors reached an imposing 315 for six after choosing to bat first			0
however , @entity2 struck an undefeated 150 and @entity3 made 107 -- his maiden century -- the two adding 224 for the third wicket as @entity6 easily overhauled the target , the highest one - day run chase at the famous @entity20 ground			1
after the tourists opted to bat , @entity6 began well with the ball , conceding a measly nine from five immaculate overs sent down by new - ball bowlers @entity26 and @entity27			1
but @entity28 broke the shackles by driving @entity27 through the covers in the sixth over for the first boundary and from then on @entity6 gradually lost control			2
@entity27 , who had dropped @entity12 on seven when he failed to hold on to a fairly straightforward return catch , went some way to atoning for that error by snaring @entity28 early and @entity37 , batting at three , also departed cheaply			0
but then @entity13 , who was handed a reprieve before he was even off the mark when @entity40 squandered a simple chance at third man , and @entity12 built a solid base			0
@entity12 , who increased the tempo by hitting @entity45 for five boundaries in the paceman 's first over , continued to bat steadily alongside his captain			0
the pair scored easily off the spinners and struck timely boundaries as they added 126 for the third wicket , @entity12 reaching his seventh one - day century in the process			1
the partnership was ended when the @entity4 captain was smartly stumped by @entity57 as he was too far out and across while attempting to help a @entity40 delivery down to fine leg			0
@entity12 followed @entity13 back to the pavilion quickly after , but @entity4 's middle - order kicked on			2
@entity62 chipped in with a 14 - ball 31 , while cameos from @entity65 ( 33 ) and @entity66 ( 23 not out from 15 ) helped @entity4 to a strong total			2
@entity6 's response to @entity4 's total began badly , the home side losing both openers with a mere 23 runs on the board			1
@entity74 , who shared the new ball with debutant @entity62 , claimed stand - in - captain @entity76 and @entity77 in successive overs			0
those early blows brought @entity2 and @entity3 together , the two steadying the ship with a calm and sensible approach			0
@entity3 injected momentum by hammering @entity84 for four consecutive blows in the paceman 's first over and in a period when boundaries were easily available			0
the duo then easily negotiated the spinners , rotating the strike nicely and although the run rate dropped considerably , @entity6 were well in control			2
@entity3 was first to his century and @entity2 followed a delivery later , reaching his seventh one - day century in 101 deliveries			1
@entity3 then attempted to step up the pace and succeeded by hitting the first six of the innings -- in the 39th over -- but perished soon after while attempting another off @entity100			0
their 224 - run stand was only 13 short of a record highest third - wicket partnership			2
@entity6 still needed a further 69 from little more than 10 overs at that stage , but @entity2 narrowed the gap by hitting @entity62 and then @entity108 for successive boundaries			1
@entity2 , with @entity57 for company , got @entity6 across the line , finishing off the chase with boundary off the first ball of the penultimate over .			1
