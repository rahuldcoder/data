@entity0 -- the anti-apartheid message was serious and heartfelt but the song that alerted many around the world to the injustices of the @entity8 regime could not have been more upbeat			1
" @entity16 " was a @entity9 hit in the @entity10 for @entity11 in 1984 , and it instantly became the unofficial anthem and slogan for the international anti-apartheid movement			1
the song 's eponymous subject rose to prominence in the 1950s as a radical young member of the @entity21 , the main opposition movement to the segregationist @entity8 government			1
as an advocate of guerrilla attacks , @entity16 , who has died aged 95 , was frequently arrested and eventually convicted in 1964 , along with other @entity21 leaders , for sabotage			1
he received a life prison sentence , and spent 27 years in a cell , mostly on @entity31 , off the @entity8 coast			1
while @entity16 languished in jail , an anti-apartheid movement slowly developed in the @entity35 , starting with sporting sanctions against @entity8 and later an artists ' boycott of performances in the country			1
the composer of " @entity16 , " @entity41 -- the founder of the multiracial @entity42 ska - punk band @entity11 , later renamed the @entity11 -- admits he knew little about @entity16 before he attended an anti-apartheid concert in @entity0 in 1983 , which gave him the idea for the song			1
" i 'd never actually heard of @entity16 although i knew a lot about the anti-apartheid movement and he was becoming a figurehead for the whole movement , " @entity41 told @entity1			1
the keyboardist , who also wrote " @entity52 , " the seminal specials song against the policies of @entity56 's prime minister at the time , @entity55 , may not have known much about the imprisoned anti-apartheid figurehead , but his lyrics brought @entity16 's struggle to the attention of a wider audience			1
flare and fury : how artists lambasted @entity55 the song 's relentlessly upbeat feel certainly helped push it up the charts			2
" it ends with the thing of ' i 'm begging you ' and then ' i 'm telling you , ' " @entity41 said			0
" it is a demand but in a positive way , it brought some sort of hope that the situation could be sorted out			2
" veteran @entity78 and broadcaster @entity79 said the song was effective in educating people about @entity16 , whose reputation was low in the @entity35 at the time			1
" now we have this sainted vision of @entity16 , but at the time @entity55 treated him as a terrorist			2
so to release a record about someone whom your @entity89 considers a terrorist is quite brave			0
" the song helped to change perceptions about @entity16 , according to @entity79 , a presenter on leading @entity10 station @entity95			2
" it did educate people about apartheid an incredible amount , because they certainly were n't going to learn about @entity16 from conventional sources			2
the word on him from on high was very bad , so it was up to musicians to take a leading role in rehabilitating his reputation			0
" " @entity16 " was also an extremely effective protest song , he added , a view echoed in 2010 by left - leaning current affairs magazine @entity110 , which included it in a list of the top 20 political anthems of all time			1
" ' @entity16 ' was effective for two reasons , " he said			2
" it 's a good pop record in that it 's catchy and sounds good			0
and you immediately know what it 's about , because the first three words are ' @entity16			2
' and secondly it had a clear message that the audience agreed with			0
" and the fact that @entity11 were at the time a " top 10 band " meant the audience took note			0
" if the @entity11 say it , there must be something to it , " as @entity79 noted			0
four years later , in 1988 , @entity132 and the band @entity133 helped organize the @entity134 at @entity0 's @entity135 , featuring acts such as @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139			1
@entity140 played " @entity145 " about another anti-apartheid activist , while @entity142 performed his influential song " @entity144			0
" the event was watched by a global television audience of 600 million and is credited with hardening popular opposition internationally to the apartheid regime			0
@entity79 is proud of his contribution to the event , for which he was one of the tv presenters			0
" the concert was an incredible success , " he said			0
" it had the biggest tv audience to date , and put @entity16 in topic a position around the world			0
but it might never have happened without the song ' @entity16 , ' because this inspired some of the artists who appeared at @entity135 to be there			2
" as the impact of the concert rippled around the world , the @entity8 government was secretly holding talks with @entity16			1
these meetings culminated in his release on february 11 , 1990			0
four years later , he succeeded @entity171 to become the republic 's first black president			0
@entity16 never forgot the debt he owed to supporters in the @entity10			0
in 1996 he used a speech to both houses of @entity178 in @entity0 to give his thanks : " we take this opportunity once more to pay tribute to the millions of @entity10 who , through the years , stood up to say : no to apartheid ! " in 2008 , singer @entity184 joined @entity41 for the finale to a concert in @entity0 's @entity187 marking @entity16 's 90th birthday			1
the song 's message had long since been realized -- and indeed the by - then - frail elder statesman appeared onstage -- but it was received as warmly as ever			1
@entity1 's @entity192 contributed to this report .			0
