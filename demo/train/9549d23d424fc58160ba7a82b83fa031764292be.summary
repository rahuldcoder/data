@entity0 -- a central part of the gun legislation @entity4 is expected to take up this week is the idea of expanded background checks on gun purchases			1
but few @entity8 understand how background checks actually work			1
leaders from both sides of the aisle -- and an overwhelming number of @entity8 in national opinion polls -- support expanded background checks before the purchase of guns			1
but when it comes to specifics , the divide shows			0
meanwhile , some congressional democrats are pushing not only for expanded background checks , but also for broadening the requirement for records of sale transactions			1
for some @entity31 and gun rights activists , the idea of any type of national gun registry is a deal - breaker			1
why is this so hard ? the disconnect on background checks here 's how the current system works : once you have decided to purchase a gun from a retail outlet -- it could be a local gun shop or national chain such as @entity42 , @entity43 or @entity44 -- the store enters your name and information into the @entity48 , or @entity48 , via a toll - free number or the @entity50 , to check the eligibility of the buyer			1
the check usually takes a few minutes to complete			0
the @entity48 system is linked to several databases managed by the @entity56 , including the @entity57 , and runs an individual 's name through federal and state criminal records			1
@entity1 poll : background checks popular , worrisome individuals can also be added to the @entity48 index outside of potential gun sales , on the recommendation of psychiatrists , mental health institutions and family members			2
under the current @entity48 system , buyers may be denied the purchase of a firearm for reasons such as being indicted or convicted of a felony , admitting to being addicted to a controlled substances , having been dishonorably discharged from the @entity78 , being subject to a restraining order , as well as other regulations			0
since its implementation in 1998 , 2.1 million background checks have been denied out of 118 million requests , or almost 2 %			1
from gun hater to @entity87 - loving mom the use of the @entity48 however is not required for private sales of firearms , which make up about 20 % of all firearm transactions			0
a @entity93 - backed bill being discussed in @entity4 closes this loophole , requiring background checks for all gun transactions , even private ones			1
this would extend background checks to purchases made at gun shows and on the internet			2
the current @entity48 is required by federal law -- the @entity104 of 1993 -- to destroy background check request records within 24 hours			2
opinion : why the @entity87 fights background checks and since the passage of the @entity113 , licensed gun dealers -- called ffls or @entity111 holders -- are required by the @entity114 to also have gun purchasers to fill out a federal form 4473 , which allows law enforcement officials to trace guns to their original purchasers			2
that document -- which contains the name , address , date of birth , copy of @entity125 , @entity48 background check transaction number and model and serial number of the gun purchased -- must be retained by the dealer for 20 years and carries with it the same federal privacy restrictions as a federal tax return			0
some opponents of changes to background checks cite the ineffectiveness of the current system as a reason not to expand it			2
the current system can not force states to share all of their records with the @entity48 database , especially ones regarding mental health			0
this lack of records allows some people with mental issues to legally purchase guns			0
@entity150 , the shooter in the @entity152 in 2007 , had been declared mentally ill by a judge two years before he murdered 32 people			0
but @entity150 had gone through a background check and been cleared			0
should anyone be able to buy guns ? share your views others see the expansion as another waste of government dollars , believing that people who are not likely to have background checks approved , like felons , wo n't even attempt the process , and instead will go straight to the black market to purchase firearms			0
a recent @entity1 / @entity171 poll showed that nine out of 10 @entity8 said that they support a background check on every gun sale			1
@entity174 grows for compromise proposal on gun control			0

few @entity8 understand how background checks actually work
for some @entity31 , the idea of expanded record - keeping is a deal breaker
the background check system is linked to several databases managed by the @entity56
since 1998 , almost 2 % of background checks have been denied
