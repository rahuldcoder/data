@entity0 , @entity1 -- millions of people know @entity5 's poem " @entity12 , " written in @entity6 in 1822 and believed to describe @entity8 's mode of transportation , a reindeer - driven sleigh , for the first time			1
but @entity8 's reindeer have a story and a history all of their own , one tied to the oldest indigenous culture in @entity18 and accelerated by an @entity20 entrepreneur whose principal intention was not delighting children around the world , but creating an appetite for what he hoped would become a mealtime staple as ubiquitous as beef			1
for thousands of years here in the snowy @entity30 of northern @entity1 , reindeer have been a symbol and a way of life for the @entity34 , @entity18 's oldest surviving indigenous people , spanning parts of @entity1 , @entity37 , @entity38 and the @entity39 of @entity40 , in an area that is known as @entity42			1
( they are also called @entity34			0
) about 10 percent of @entity34 still herd , with the bulk of the reindeer population found in @entity47 and @entity48 , @entity1 , where even today the reindeer are herded up into the mountains for the long winter and brought down again in spring			2
the @entity34 are some of the most tenacious people on earth -- the cowboys and cowgirls of the tundra , deeply in tune with nature and able to deftly move and guide huge herds of animals during brutal winters over vast expanses			2
to many , there are no better herders in the world			0
reindeer first came to @entity66 , via @entity67 , through the work of an @entity66 missionary named @entity70			1
in the mid- 1800s , many @entity71 were starving due to the commercial overfishing of whales , the core of the @entity71 diet , for whale oil			0
consumed with the idea finding an alternative food source for this culture , @entity70 turned to the idea of reindeer herding and husbandry			0
thanks to @entity70 's lobbying , the @entity20 government agreed , appropriating funds to support seeding the plan by knowledge transfer of expert herders to the @entity71 , starting with a short - lived attempt with @entity91 , and later , the @entity34			1
and so in 1898 , more than 100 @entity93 herders and their families , and nearly 600 reindeer , made the passage from the north of @entity1 to the @entity20 , ending up in @entity66 to introduce reindeer herding , @entity34 style , to @entity100			1
while reindeer are at the heart of traditional @entity34 culture , the idea of a jolly , gift - giving @entity8 flying around with his herd has no part in their history or tradition			1
the two ideas collided in popular culture via a businessman in @entity66 named @entity112			2
when the reindeer came to @entity66 and began to flourish , @entity112 , a native of @entity114 , saw the commercial , mass - market possibilities of reindeer meat and fur for the @entity20 and sought to promote it aggressively			1
@entity112 was as much a clever marketer as a businessman , and in 1926 he conceived , along with @entity121 , a promotional @entity123 parade led by @entity8 , his reindeer , a sleigh and several @entity126 in their vibrant traditional dress			1
eventually , similar parades were held in cities around the country , and a meme was born			0
@entity112 is said to have further accelerated his marketing efforts by planting fake children 's letters in local newspapers , the fictitious children asking for @entity8 and his reindeer to visit their towns			2
in the 1920s , the @entity138 owned more than a quarter - million reindeer , and @entity112 became known as " the reindeer king			0
" but reindeer meat never took off in @entity100 for many reasons , most notably pressure from the cattle lobby and changes in laws about who could own reindeer in the @entity20 -- the right eventually going in 1937 to indigenous @entity20 cultures , excluding even the @entity34			1
( the law was reversed 60 years later			0
) @entity112 's company was forced out of the reindeer business as a result , but his marketing efforts unleashed a worldwide obsession with @entity8 and created a common narrative now known around the world , and even elaborated on : @entity158 , the most famous reindeer of all , was not based in mythology or literature stemming from an indigenous culture , but was instead concocted as a character in a coloring book distributed in 1939 by the now - defunct @entity166 department stores			2
as a @entity34 descendant , i became curious about the origin of @entity8 and his gang of reindeer last year on the @entity30 tundra , where i experienced firsthand how difficult it can be to rig up even one reindeer			1
as beautiful and majestic as the reindeer are , they can be skittish , and the idea of rigging eight together and making forward progress seemed ambitious , even in a children 's poem			0
for a sled , only one reindeer is the @entity34 tradition , but sometimes more are used when pulling supplies			0
i 've queried many herders about the feasibility of eight reindeer -- it is possible in the right hands , but not common			0
and these days in @entity42 , the snowmobile has replaced the reindeer for transportation purposes , anyway -- something @entity8 may want to consider			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			0

reindeer are a way of life for the @entity34 people of @entity18 , says @entity194
an @entity66 missionary helped bring reindeer to @entity100 in the 1800s , she says
@entity194 : in the 1920s an @entity20 businessman tried to popularize reindeer meat
his marketing campaign helped create the *indelible* image of @entity8 and reindeer , she says
