-- they were the strangest 34 minutes in @entity3 history : the two teams were standing on the field			2
a hundred million people were watching at home			0
and the only thing that was happening was -- nothing			0
the power outage at the @entity11 was not only one of the biggest story lines for @entity14			1
it sets the stage for the big game in one year at @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20			1
think about it : if a minor power outage can dominate talk around the biggest sporting event of the year , imagine the possible doomsday scenarios for the league 's first cold - weather outdoor game			1
a winter storm could shut down the transportation hubs -- as a powerful nor'easter was expected to do through the @entity31 starting friday afternoon			1
freezing rain could make the experience miserable for spectators			1
5 @entity3 moments to talk about monday or the poor weather could keep the fans from arriving early in the week leading up to the game , which is when the host market reaps the biggest benefits from having the game			1
for these reasons and more , the @entity42 / @entity20 @entity3 -- just 359 days from now , for those fans already in serious football withdrawal -- could be the most important in @entity47 history			1
if the game is a success , it could not only open the door for @entity42 / @entity20 to host future games -- and the ceo of its host committee said last week he wants that to become a reality -- but it also could lead to bids from other cold - weather markets such as @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60			1
the funniest tweets of the @entity62 , er @entity3 if the game is a failure , it would not only reflect poorly on @entity47 commissioner @entity65 , who pushed for it , but it also would be the third black eye in four years for the marquee event on the @entity47 calendar			2
in 2011 , the @entity3 in @entity70 was marred by controversy when temporary sections in @entity73 failed inspection , which meant 1,250 fans had expensive tickets for the game but no seats			1
this winter , the power failure may have helped the 49ers -- down 28 - 6 when the lights went out -- to regroup and nearly pull off the greatest comeback in the game 's history			1
@entity42 / @entity20 is on the clock			2
can it exceed expectations ? @entity88 , the ceo of the host committee , not only thinks it will , but also believes hosting the game wo n't be a one - time thing			2
" it 's the biggest sporting event in @entity94 , " @entity88 said			0
" it 's only right that it gets on the biggest stage in the world , and hopefully it makes sense that that should happen once a decade			2
right ? jokesters , advertisers pounce on @entity3 power outage " i do n't have any vision that we 're going to get three out of the next 12 @entity3 or something			1
but maybe , because of all the other things you can do in the region , which is an endless list of options , we can have it again			0
" @entity88 and his team spent last week in @entity114 attending events and meetings to gather as much information as possible from a city that has hosted 10 @entity3			0
they returned home to begin processing that information and continue their preparations for next winter			0
the priority : finding more volunteers			0
@entity88 said 12,000 already have signed up , but he wants about 18,000 -- many of them at every major transportation hub , helping the visitors find their way around			0
@entity88 is counting on the many entertainment options in the @entity42 / @entity20 region -- from @entity132 to the museums to the long list of restaurants -- to make the week special for fans			1
some of the problems that occurred in smaller @entity3 cities such as @entity139 and @entity140 , including long lines at most dining options and a scarcity of taxis , are not a concern			2
but the @entity42 / @entity20 bid is combating more than just @entity147 to make it successful			1
fans generally attend an event like this to be around others like themselves			0
they take over a city like @entity114 for the week			0
will @entity42 swallow the game whole ? the city hopes it has a solution -- something called " @entity157 , " a massive fan event in @entity159 from january 29 to february 1 that will feature nightly concerts , @entity47 - theme exhibits and even the @entity161			1
still , with the teams practicing in @entity20 and the game and game - day events across the @entity166 , @entity88 knows most fans will have to rely on public transportation			1
" if you can make the fan comfortable , feeling safe and feeling welcome , and there 's a lot to do , i think that makes a great @entity3 experience , " @entity88 said			2
" i do n't know how much the game is the draw			0
the game is the great enabler -- it creates all of this -- but whether the @entity3 is exciting or not exciting , they still want to come back to it and the experience that surrounds it			2
" @entity65 is counting on it			0
he admitted that the success or failure of the @entity42 / @entity20 game will affect where the @entity47 places its big event in the future			1
@entity189 , @entity190 , will host the game in 2015 , while the 2016 host -- @entity193 or @entity194 -- will be announced on may 22			0
" the game of football is made to be played in the elements , " @entity65 said			0
" now , we hope they 're not extreme , but we 'll be prepared for that if that 's the case			0
some of our most classic games were played in extreme weather conditions			0
you know them all : the @entity206			0
some of the games that i look back as a fan and say , ' that was fun			0
' " will @entity211 end up on that list ? or will a winter storm make that 34 - minute power outage in @entity114 seem like a happy moment in @entity47 history by comparison ?			1

@entity219 : @entity11 power outage sets stage for next year 's @entity3 in @entity20
winter storm could shut down transportation and make for freezing , miserable spectators
but if the game is a success , more cold - weather markets may host @entity3
fans like to take over host cities , so @entity233 *wonders* if @entity42 will " swallow the game whole "
