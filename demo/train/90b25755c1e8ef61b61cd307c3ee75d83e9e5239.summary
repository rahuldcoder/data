@entity0 -- the mother of a man who died while honeymooning on a cruise in 2005 has new hope that the mystery surrounding his death will be solved after the @entity9 's @entity0 office agreed to review the case			1
" the tide is turning , i think , now , " @entity11 , the mother of @entity12 , told @entity1 on tuesday			2

" @entity12 , 26 , went overboard from the @entity18 ship @entity19 on july 5 , 2005 , at 4:30 a.m. , according to @entity12 family attorney @entity20			1
his wife , @entity21 , was found passed out in a hallway of the cruise ship that morning , @entity20 said			1
investigators found blood on the sheets in the @entity29 ' room and on the canopy over the lifeboats , about a 20 - to 30 - foot fall from @entity29 ' stateroom , the attorney said			0
a four - fingered bloody handprint was found on the ship 's edge , where it appears @entity12 had been holding on before he descended into the water , @entity20 told @entity1			1
the @entity37 has long held the belief that @entity12 was murdered			2
" it 's very difficult , and we have had many obstacles put in our path , but we are still here and we are still fighting , " @entity11 said			0
@entity44 , a spokesman for the @entity9 's @entity0 office , told @entity1 the office was reviewing the matter			1
a statement tuesday from @entity18 emphasized the cruise line has consistently " provided unfettered support , assistance and cooperation to the @entity9 , including the provision of all documents and materials that were requested			1
" as part of these efforts , @entity18 assembled over 6,000 pages of documents covering its investigation of the disappearance of @entity63 and made all this information available to the @entity9			1
the company has worked closely with all law enforcement agencies including the @entity9 and remains readily available to them if there is any further inquiry into the matter , " the statement said			0
@entity20 said the family had been seeking the transfer of jurisdiction from the @entity9 's @entity76 office to the agency 's @entity0 bureau for almost two years , after a video surfaced that showed at least three @entity82 - @entity81 passengers on the same cruise joking about @entity12 's death			1
" two of the targets from the investigation reside in @entity0 , " @entity20 said			0
the attorney said he became aware of the video when lawyers for the cruise line turned over information and video after the @entity37 reached a settlement with @entity18			2
@entity20 said the video is in the possession of the @entity9			0
while he has n't seen it himself , he said he 's been told what 's on it by an attorney for @entity18			0
it apparently shows one of the @entity82 - @entity81 passengers making an incriminating statement			0
the passenger " stands up , hunches his shoulders and flashes gang signs , in the context of @entity12 's death , " @entity20 said			0
the men were interrogated by police on the ship the morning @entity12 went missing , according to @entity20			2
@entity12 had been hanging out with these men at the casino and then at the ship 's disco the night before and into the wee hours of the morning , the lawyer said			2
@entity118 , a maritime attorney who represented @entity12 's wife when she sued @entity18 in 2006 for the wrongful death of her husband , believes a crime did occur			1
@entity118 said he took a forensic specialist on board the ship during his investigation into @entity12 's death in 2005			1
" my only hope is that the @entity9 will make an arrest and there will be a prosecution because it 's long overdue , " @entity118 told @entity1 on tuesday			0
