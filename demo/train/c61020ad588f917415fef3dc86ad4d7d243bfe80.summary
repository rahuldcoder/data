-- when @entity2 unveiled record gambling revenues on tuesday , the government was silent about the source of much of the cash fuelling the territory 's boom : illegal money transfers from mainland @entity9			1
from pawn shops offering money withdrawal services , to underground banks using human mules to transport cash across the border , @entity2 tolerates the illicit methods that mainland punters use to bring money into the former @entity20 colony , which reverted to @entity9 control in 1999			1
mainland tourists , who have made @entity2 the world 's largest gambling centre , can legally bring only rmb20 , 000 ( $ 3,175 ) when crossing into the @entity9 territory			1
but many gamblers bring more cash to the casino tables by using their unionpay debit card to withdraw money -- for a fee			1
" there is no risk			0
we pretend to sell the customer an expensive watch or a piece of jewellery , charge the amount in renminbi to the debit card , and then give him the equivalent amount in @entity2 patacas or @entity51 dollars as if the customer had decided to return the object for an immediate cash refund , " says the manager of a pawnshop up the street from the @entity38 casino , @entity2 's oldest casino owned by @entity39 , the gambling tycoon			1
the manager says the cardholder 's records will register the transaction as a purchase			0
@entity60 , which was formed by @entity9 's big banks , says it bans such transactions , but the company declined to comment on the fact that the practice remained widespread			0
the company said it no longer released data on how much cardholders spent in @entity2			1
people familiar with the industry say the @entity2 government can not afford to shut down the illegal services , which hundreds of pawn shops advertise publicly on neon signs			2
" the @entity2 government 's hands are tied , " says one veteran @entity2 policeman			2
" it is not going to initiate a crackdown , because over 75 per cent of its revenue comes from gaming taxes			0
" about 16m mainland @entity9 visited @entity2 in 2011 , an increase of more than 20 per cent on the previous year , and 60 per cent more than the 10m who visited in 2006			1
analysts estimate that up to 30 per cent of @entity2 's gaming revenue could be channelled through illegal channels			2
" banking restrictions make it very difficult to transfer funds to @entity2 legitimately , but it is easy for people to find ways [ around the rules ] , " says a senior @entity9 bank manager who gambles in @entity2			2
while the debit card cashback service is the most visible source of money for the less well - heeled punters , those with deeper pockets have found different ways to avoid the restrictions			0
vip punters -- whom analysts estimate generate 70 per cent of @entity2 's gaming revenues -- gamble on credit provided by so - called junket operators who seek out wealthy mainland gamblers			1
the junket operators receive commissions from the casinos or get a share of the profits			0
they , or their agents , sometimes use underground banks to return the money they have collected as debt on the mainland to @entity2			1
the lenders use criminal gangs from @entity127 and @entity129 provinces who in turn pay human mules as little as $ 5 -- compared with @entity129 's average daily wage of $ 7 -- to smuggle cash across the border			1
while the underground banks are part of what is known as the shadow banking system in @entity9 , providing credit to cash - strapped companies , their @entity2 - related business is limited to transferring money from other sources			1
one former junket operator and a @entity51 owner of a mainland factory in @entity129 province , just across the border from @entity2 , described how operators also use @entity51 business people who own companies on the mainland to transfer money illegally			1
he said operators handed over renminbi debts collected on the mainland to the factory owner , who used the money to pay his staff wages			2
then , the owner sent the equivalent in @entity51 dollars from his @entity51 bank account to the operator 's account in @entity2			2
both sides profited by agreeing a mutually beneficial exchange rate			0
there is no public data available to indicate exactly how much of @entity2 's gaming revenue comes from illegal channels , and casino operators and government officials refuse to speak about the issue			2
@entity2 's @entity175 and @entity176 refused to comment			0
" neither the @entity2 government nor @entity178 wishes to damage the @entity2 economy			0
there 's good reason to keep the scale of illegal transactions a closely guarded secret so nobody needs to take action , " says the police officer			0
while @entity178 does not condone gambling on the mainland , it has so far not cracked down on the illegal transfers			0
analysts say it is unlikely to take action as the @entity195 does not want to destabilise @entity2 just 13 years after the city returned to @entity9 rule			0
" @entity178 is unlikely to take measures such as tightening visa restrictions or clamping down on debit card cashback services , as long as @entity2 is seen as a safe and enjoyable place to visit and casino operators refrain from activities or comments that might portray the city in a bad light , " says @entity198 , the @entity2 - based managing partner at @entity199 , a @entity200 research group			0
