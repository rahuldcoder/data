@entity0 -- while @entity4 's fight for freedom gets bloodier by the day and @entity6 faces the @entity8 's cold shoulder , in the elegant surroundings of @entity0 's @entity10 , one oligarch is using art to get his message across			1
" this work is called ' widows , ' for one simple reason , " says @entity14 as he points towards a picture of five elderly ladies looking forlorn			2
" because instead of an icon [ on the wall ] there is @entity23			0
" and in cottages where the father of socialism has taken the @entity33 's place , he explains , " this tells us the women depicted have probably lost their husbands in the war			0
" for almost half a century the widows ' empty eyes have stared out over @entity37 's @entity36 , caught behind the iron curtain as a new , " cold " war came and went			0
but now , thanks to the 42 - year - old 's passion for paintings , they have been given a new perspective , on display for the first time in @entity0 alongside 39 other canvasses by @entity48 , in a special exhibition dedicated to the @entity51 - era artist			1
the exhibition includes pieces from @entity14 's own collection , and brings together works from museums across @entity6 's biggest cities , recording a @entity57 age when heroic peasants and propaganda had begun to give way to themes of industrial optimism and the bloom of youth			1
" i was born in the @entity51 and i loved that country , " says @entity14			1
" so it seems right to showcase the good things that it created because there was n't the opportunity to do so before			0
as a period , it was somewhat misunderstood			0
" with an estimated $ 1 billion fortune this @entity73 rich list stalwart has clearly done well out of his country 's break with communism			0
yet he is nostalgic about the past and , having amassed a sizeable collection of @entity51 masterpieces , @entity14 hopes to one day found his own museum in @entity0 and promote a " better understanding " of his home nation			1
" i want to show the creative work of the @entity6 people , so that there is more love for @entity6 , " he says			2
" that is why i want to build a museum here			0
" @entity14 is n't new to the world of soft diplomacy			1
as president of the @entity95 , he has overseen international tournaments at the @entity97 in @entity98 and personally funded the restoration of the tomb of the @entity6 chess legend @entity101 in the same city			2
cultural exchanges , he says , can be key ways of keeping the dialogue going			0
" for people to understand each other better they must communicate ... through the exchange of culture , through exhibitions , through theaters , through music and ballet			0
" i hope this exhibition will improve the understanding and relations between different peoples and countries			1
" for @entity14 , just like many @entity4 - born @entity6 , the concept of " home " is more complicated than it first seems			1
born in @entity129 in @entity4 , the co-owner of the ports and roads firm @entity126 describes himself as @entity6 but still has relatives in @entity4			2
and like many practical business people with a sizeable stake in this complex region , @entity14 leaves the artwork to make the bold political statements , saying only he considers sanctions imposed by the @entity137 and the @entity138 , " a big mistake			1
" according to @entity14 , " the sooner there is an understanding by the @entity143 countries and the @entity138 , the faster there will be logical , sensible and constructive relations			1
" putting on a large @entity6 art show in @entity0 at a time of heightened animosity towards his country is an ambitious project			1
even talking about art , at a time of deadly skirmishes in @entity4 , may seem flippant but @entity14 does have another motive for wanting to host the show : to cater for the @entity159 capital 's sizeable @entity6 expat population			1
" walking around here i discovered there is not one large collection of @entity6 art , " he says			2
" @entity6 culture is not presented here yet hundreds of thousands of people from @entity6 live here			2
@entity6 children go to school here and they are losing their connection to their own culture			0
" " @entity48 : @entity175 " was organized last year as part of 2014 's somewhat overshadowed @entity159 - @entity171 well before @entity4 's crisis pitted the countries against each other			0
