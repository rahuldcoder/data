@entity0 -- thousands of pro-democracy protesters jammed the streets of @entity0 's central business district saturday night and early sunday , clapping and cheering just hours after an ultimatum by government leaders : let city workers back in their offices soon , or else			1
demonstrators swarmed the semi-autonomous @entity13 territory 's @entity11 district to hear nighttime speeches from protest leaders perched on a small spotlighted podium -- all defying city leaders ' insistence that they disperse and let @entity0 's life and commerce return to normal			1
even after the rally , many hundreds camped out or roamed the streets early sunday , stretching the demonstrations into their eighth day and raising the prospect that protesters intend to test the government 's latest ultimatum			1
" there have been continuous clashes over the past couple days , " @entity29 , police senior superintendent , said at a sunday morning press briefing			2
he said clashes were in the @entity35 district			0
" police officers are still dealing with the situation			1
protesters in those areas have been extremely uncooperative			2
" chief executive @entity40 -- under pressure from protesters demanding his resignation -- took to television saturday evening to once again demand that protesters disperse immediately			2
but his demand now came with a deadline : the streets must be clear by monday so that classes could resume at schools , he said			1
and entrances to the government headquarters also must be clear then , he said			1
he said protesters blocked 3,000 government employees from going to work friday , clogging all entrances to the city 's chief executive office building -- something he said would not be repeated monday			1
" the government and the police have the responsibilities and determination to take all necessary actions to restore social order , " @entity40 said in his televised address			1
" there are numerous social problems to be solved , " @entity40 added , " but the proper way is through rational communication , finding commonalities and preserving differences -- not through resistance on ( the ) street that worsens the problem , " he said			0
who is @entity40 ? pro-democracy activists , led by student groups , are demonstrating for universal suffrage in @entity0 and the right to directly choose candidates for elected office -- rather than having @entity13 choose the eligible candidates			1
they 've also called for the resignation of @entity40 , whom the protesters view as a puppet of @entity86			2
despite @entity40 's warning , activists showed no signs of going anywhere soon			0
instead of tearing down barricades meant to impede any security forces , participants built them up saturday night , making piles of metal on the perimeter			0
protest leaders said friday 's violence -- scuffles between protesters and counter-protesters in @entity35 , a nearby district -- reinforced their resolve			0
they accuse police of standing by and failing to take action when some students were attacked and beaten , and when some were sexually assaulted			1
peaceful protests against the government will continue despite provocations , @entity107 , leader of the @entity108 , told reporters saturday afternoon			1
throughout the day saturday , small skirmishes continued with mainly older residents -- appearing in their 40s or 50s -- yelling at the youngsters sitting by the main tent in the @entity35 protest area			0
one older man swore at the students , repeatedly cursing at them as " kids causing trouble			0
" protest leaders : police did n't stop attackers a source familiar with the @entity0 government said leaders expect a prolonged faceoff and know the conflict wo n't resolve itself in two or three days			1
the government plans to " wait it out " and thinks the number of protesters will gradually diminish , the source said			1
@entity86 worries that @entity0 could become an anti-communist base and that pro-democracy protests could gain traction in other @entity13 cities , the source said			1
@entity86 thinks granting @entity0 the right to nominate candidates is a threat to national security , the source said			1
health officials said more than 50 people were injured in friday 's protests , which were punctuated by scuffles between protesters and counterprotesters in @entity35 , a tightly packed district of shops and residences surrounding one of the city 's busiest intersections			2
at least 19 people were arrested friday into saturday , police said , on suspicion of crimes including fighting in public places , unlawful assembly and assault			0
protest leaders backed out of negotiations with government officials after friday 's violence in @entity35 , where protest opponents tore down tents and scuffled with demonstrators ; dozens were injured			0
the attacks have strained relations as demonstrators say police officers failed to protect them when they were assaulted ; police accuse protesters of escalating the situation			1
critics of the pro-democracy movement , called @entity177 , say the weeklong demonstrations have hurt the economy and small businesses , and clogged traffic and daily operations of the city			0
student leaders say they refuse to negotiate with the government until there is an explanation of police action			2
@entity189 , the 17 - year - old leader of student group @entity190 , told @entity1 's @entity191 that the @entity0 government should " pay responsibility of this accident			1
" meet the 17 - year - old student agitating for change assistant commissioner of police @entity197 rejected the protesters ' claims , saying the accusations were " totally unfounded and extremely unfair to police officers who faithfully and diligently performed their duty at the scene			2
" he said police separated the two parties and set up a buffer area to prevent further injuries			0
in the seven days of protest , more than 150 people have been injured , and 12 were in a hospital as of 2 p.m. saturday , the city 's information services department said			0
the @entity214 @entity213 in @entity0 issued an advisory , warning @entity214 citizens " to avoid all protest areas due to the potential risk of escalating violence			1
" @entity220 : ' it 's anarchy ' a few dozen people who oppose the protests peacefully walked to a police station saturday morning with blue ribbons -- which signify solidarity with the officers			2
we know what they want			0
why do they still stay ? " said one of them , retired police officer @entity231			0
" go to the park			0
do n't obstruct the daily operations of @entity0			2
" another resident , @entity237 , a retiree added : " it 's anarchy			0
what i oppose is anarchy			0
" @entity0 protests : what 's next ? what protesters want demonstrators are upset with a recently enacted policy giving @entity86 veto power on who can run as a candidate for the chief executive role in the 2017 election			1
a new electoral system will , for the first time , let the city 's 5 million eligible voters pick a winner , rather than a 1,200 - member committee stacked with @entity86 loyalists that has chosen past leaders			0
but critics argue that the right to vote is pointless if the candidates are handpicked by @entity86			0
they complain the @entity13 government is encroaching too much on the affairs of @entity0 , a semiautonomous @entity13 territory ruled according to the " one country , two systems " policy since @entity270 handed over @entity0 in 1997			1
@entity86 condemns the protests as " illegal acts " and in a saturday editorial of @entity273 , the mouthpiece of the @entity275 , dismissed the movement 's potential to spread to mainland @entity13 as " no more than a daydream			0
" @entity1 's @entity280 and @entity281 reported and wrote from @entity0			2
