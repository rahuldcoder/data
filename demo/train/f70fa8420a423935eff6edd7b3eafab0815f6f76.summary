@entity1 , @entity0 -- the threat from terrorists using chemical , biological and even nuclear weapons is growing , @entity3 said tuesday , warning advances in technology will enable extremists to conduct more lethal attacks in the future			1
muslim extremists killed 52 people in bomb attacks in @entity1 in july 2005			2
the predictions came as prime minister @entity17 's government 's laid out its anti-terrorism policies and strategy in a document containing previously - classified information			1
in it the government also warned that although the @entity27 organization of @entity28 , was likely to fragment in coming years , the group 's ideology will live on			1
under the strategy @entity3 , where 52 people were killed by home - grown @entity31 extremists in july 2005 bomb attacks on @entity1 's transit network , says it needs to focus on longer - term causes of terrorism			1
it says the current threat to @entity3 and its interests comes primarily from four interrelated sources : it says some of the factors that sustain terrorism today are likely to persist in the future -- such as conflicts exploited by terrorist groups that show no signs of abating , and evolving technology that enables terrorist acts			1
other trends , however , will constrain terrorist groups , such as being short of money and funding and having their ideology rejected by @entity57 across the @entity31 world , the government said			1
as part of its strategy to prevent terrorism , the government will openly challenge views that could encourage violence , may " undermine our shared values " and " jeopardize community cohesion , " the government said			2
" we have no intention of outlawing these views or criminalizing those who hold them , " the report says			2
" freedom of thought and speech are rights which are fundamental to our society			2
but we will not hear these views in silence			0
we should all stand up for our shared values and not concede the floor to those who dismiss them			0
" the report says everyone -- government , citizens , and communities -- must challenge those who " dismiss our shared values			0
" @entity3 government officials plan to work alongside @entity31 scholars , faith groups and influential people to challenge the ideologies that support extremism , the report said			0
the government even plans to sponsor the wider teaching of @entity31 and religious education , and develop citizenship education in mosque schools			0
those who are vulnerable to radicalism are also a target of the government 's plan			0
there will be programs for mentoring , diversionary activities and leadership training as well as more intensive intervention for those who have already been drawn into violent extremist networks , the government said .			0

new strategy says @entity27 will fragment but ideology will live on
terrorists more likely to take advantage of new technology in future
*financial* constraints likely to restrain some terrorists
