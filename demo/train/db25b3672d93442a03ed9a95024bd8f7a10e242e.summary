-- former motorsport chief @entity1 is adamant the re-instated @entity3 @entity2 will not go ahead because @entity5 's 12 teams are unlikely to ratify the decision			1
the @entity8 kingdom was due to host the opening race of the 2011 season in march but it was postponed because of civil unrest in the country			1
the body that governs @entity5 -- the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) -- unanimously decided to reschedule the race for october 30 , and move the inaugural @entity17 @entity2 to december			1
but @entity1 , a former head of the @entity15 , told @entity0 any move to change the racing calendar needs the full support of all 12 teams that compete in the sport , and that there are bound to be objections			1
@entity3 's @entity5 race rescheduled for october @entity1 told @entity0 : " i 'd be astonished if it happened			1
i think the decision was the wrong one and i think it is bound to be reversed			0
i do n't think there 's any chance there will be a @entity3 @entity2 on october 30 and i think its most unlikely there will be one this year			0
@entity33 : @entity5 wrong to reinstate @entity3 " when you 're going to change something in the middle of the season , like the proposal to move the @entity17 race for example , that needs the unanimous agreement of all the teams			1
i do n't think there 's the slightest chance of that actually being given			0
" the teams have complete power in this particular case because although the governing body can cancel an event for reason of force majeure - as happened in the case of @entity3 -- when you want to put an event on or move an event , that 's a change to the conditions under which the teams entered for the season and that 's like any contract -- you can only change it if both sides agree			2
" all 12 teams would have to agree to change the @entity17 date and go back to @entity3 , so it only takes one team to say ' i do n't agree ' and that 'll be the end of it			1
it would not be possible for it to happen			0
" @entity15 president @entity70 and vice-president @entity71 visited @entity3 before announcing their decision , but it drew criticism from @entity75 and current @entity76 driver @entity33			1
the @entity77 said he thought going back to @entity3 would only cause more tension			0
" like it or not , @entity5 and sport in general is n't above having a social responsibility and conscience , " he told his personal web site			2
@entity1 said there would be no long term damage done to @entity5 if the move was swiftly scrapped			1
if it was n't , protests could ensue , he suggested			0
" i think if it gets reversed quickly and people understand what is going on in @entity3 and act accordingly , i do n't think it will do any damage at all , it will just show a mistake was made that was quickly put right , " he told @entity0			2
" if @entity5 were to persist in the idea of having a race in october i think it would do enormous damage because i think there would be protests at @entity99 and other races , some of the sponsors would come under pressure from their customers and therefore put the teams under pressure			1
" i think it would be very difficult to predict how far it would go			0
on top of that i think there 's a high likelihood , i think @entity33 's right , you 'd have some really unfortunate incident when the race took place			2
happily , i think that 's academic			0
" it would be contrary to the rules , contrary to article 66 of the international sporting code , it would , apart from any other consideration , send a completely wrong message about what @entity5 is there for and what our sport is all about			2
" @entity1 even suggested next year 's race in @entity3 could be in jeopardy if problems persist			2
next year : " they must be given a chance but i do n't think anybody would want to go there when people are in prison without trial , when doctors and nurses have been arrested simply for treating injured people , " he said			0
" all of those things are very disagreeable			0
we have to wait and see how things develop and not pre-judge it			0
