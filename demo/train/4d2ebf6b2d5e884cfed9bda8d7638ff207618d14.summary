@entity0 -- two days after voters angry with @entity0 's dysfunction swept @entity5 into control of the @entity7 and expanded their advantage in the @entity9 , speaker @entity2 used his first post-midterm news conference to issue a " burn " notice to the commander - in - chief			1
" when you play with matches , you take the risk of burning yourself and he 's going to burn himself if he continues to go down that path , " the @entity14 @entity5 told reporters on @entity16 , when asked about president @entity18 's plans to issue executive orders on immigration before year 's end			1
just hours after @entity18 recommitted himself to staying the course on immigration orders and protecting his signature health care law , @entity5 spent thursday firing back shots at the administration , signaling that tuesday 's midterms did little to quell partisan tension in @entity0			1
@entity35 members as well as @entity5 leaders on the @entity37 took the election results as a sign to dig in on their issues , and while both parties made reference to compromise , thursday 's developments suggested more of the opposite was in store			0
@entity18 alone after midterm repudiation two of the most powerful @entity5 in @entity0 , @entity2 and the expected next senate majority leader @entity47 , outlined their priorities in writing , using an oped in the @entity51 to showcase their 2015 priorities			1
among them : repealing @entity53 , authorizing construction of the @entity56 oil pipeline and reforming the tax code			0
the pair took shots at @entity61 @entity9 and @entity7 leaders who shepherded most of @entity18 's significant legislative achievements through @entity63 , saying they " wo n't repeat the mistakes made when a different majority ran @entity63 in the first years of @entity18 's presidency , attempting to reshape large chunks of the nation 's economy with massive bills that few @entity71 have read and fewer understand			1
" and in his press conference , @entity2 said the @entity9 will likely vote again next year to repeal the @entity53 -- both in full and in separate chunks , like stripping away the medical device tax and the individual mandate			2
get ready : 2016 starts now and he warned that if @entity18 will " burn himself " if he overhauls the @entity71 immigration system through executive order in the coming weeks -- which president has pledged to do			1
going ahead with those plans , @entity2 said , will " poison the well " in the eyes of congressional @entity5			2
it 's the same phrase @entity47 leader @entity47 used wednesday -- indicating that a major fight is likely to come before the new @entity63 is even sworn in			0
@entity9 press secretary @entity86 said in his thursday briefing that @entity18 is looking forward to meeting with @entity5 leaders and hearing their ideas			1
" the good news though is that the deck has been reshuffled , " @entity86 said			0
" there 's now a @entity5 majority in the @entity7			1
there 's a @entity5 majority in the @entity9			1
and you could understand how this might change the political calculation that @entity5 make			0
maybe they now see that it would be in their own personal political interest to try to find some common ground with the president			0
" opinion : did @entity71 get what they want ? @entity18 himself repeated his plans for an executive overhaul of immigration laws during hid wednesday news conference			2
but he also said he 'd like to sit down for @entity113 bourbon with @entity114 and telling voters -- and those who stayed away from the polls tuesday -- that he heard their message			0
@entity2 , one of several republicans to mention their mistrust of the president , said thursday that he is n't buying it			2
" the president said , ' i listened to what happened tuesday night , ' " @entity2 said before adding , with an incredulous grin : " really ? " @entity35 chairman @entity126 told @entity1 on wednesday night that it 's " bizarre " to see @entity18 and his allies now looking for areas of compromise			1
he pointed to @entity18 's handling of immigration -- the president had initially planned to take executive action over the summer , but deferred that move until after the midterm elections			2
" i do n't believe a thing he says , " @entity126 said when asked by @entity1 's @entity136 about working with the president			0
" all he 's been doing for the last year is lying to @entity140 voters across the country			0
" while @entity114 's ascendancy to the @entity7 majority leader 's post is all but assured and @entity2 is staying on as speaker , @entity142 have some leadership questions of their own to sort through after tuesday 's devastating elections			1
why @entity149 , @entity150 are sticking around @entity152 chairman @entity151 told @entity153 he wo n't stay on for a third election -- though he does want a seat at the @entity142 ' already - crowded leadership table			0
the first look at the new political landscape will come later this month , when lawmakers return for leadership elections and the @entity9 is scheduled to vote on a series of @entity163 regulatory bills			0
in the coming weeks @entity63 will also take up @entity18 's request for more than $ 6 billion in new ebola - related funding , spending bills to fund the government and potentially legislation to authorize the use of military force against @entity171 .			0

house speaker @entity2 warned president @entity18 against executive orders on immigration
his remarks come amid many @entity5 speaking out against the @entity9
two days after the midterms , big fights are much easier to spot than areas of compromise
republicans won back control of the @entity7 and *increased* their majority in the @entity9
