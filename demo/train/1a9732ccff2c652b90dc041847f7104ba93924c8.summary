@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity0 's cabinet voted wednesday to support prime minister @entity5 's call to hold a referendum as soon as possible about the latest bailout plan , ministers coming out of the meeting told a @entity2 affiliate			1
the vote was unanimous , though some of the ministers expressed criticism prior to casting their votes , @entity2 affiliate @entity11 reported			1
the cabinet vote came hours before @entity23 chancellor @entity22 , @entity18 president @entity17 and senior figures from the @entity20 and @entity21 were to meet wednesday with @entity0 officials at an emergency meeting in @entity26 , @entity18 , ahead of the @entity28 summit			1
their meeting comes a day after @entity32 and @entity33 stock markets tumbled after @entity5 's call for the referendum on international aid for his country			1
a " no " vote could theoretically force @entity0 to crash out of the euro and send shock waves through the global financial system			1
@entity5 is seeking public backing from the @entity0 people for last week 's bailout deal , which took months to reach			1
but the move created turmoil in domestic politics , with @entity5 forced to hold an emergency cabinet meeting late tuesday , and angered his @entity33 counterparts			2
@entity17 and @entity22 issued a terse statement on tuesday saying they were " determined to ensure the full implementation , without delay , of decisions adopted by the summit , which are necessary now more than ever			0
" @entity57 spokesman @entity56 struck a similar note , saying @entity5 's move reinforced the need for @entity33 " to elaborate further and implement rapidly the decisions they made last week			1
" @entity23 and @entity18 markets closed down about 5 % tuesday , while @entity64 's @entity63 fell 2.4 % and the @entity66 index closed down nearly 300 points			1
@entity0 's former deputy finance minister , @entity68 , a member of the opposition @entity69 who is not currently in office , told @entity2 he doubted the referendum would take place			1
@entity5 is under enormous pressure from @entity33 , the markets and opposition forces within @entity0 to backtrack on the proposal , @entity68 said			1
he described @entity5 's actions as a political gamble that had gone wrong , with the prime minister having tried to make the opposition parties share the pain of unpopular reforms			0
he suggested @entity5 would have to call elections or stand down as leader , as @entity0 was " not governable " with him as prime minister			2
the announcement of the referendum rattled @entity5 's hold on power , as a lawmaker defected from his party , leaving him with a majority of only two in @entity95			0
@entity96 announced her resignation from the @entity99 party , saying the call for a referendum was " a deeply divisive procedure			0
" the deal reached last week would see the country 's sky - high debts cut in half , but it comes with strings attached , which have led to angry demonstrations in the streets of @entity0			1
reflecting that anger , @entity0 's opposition leader , @entity111 , called tuesday for a snap election , but it is unlikely he has the votes to force one			2
@entity5 has called for a vote of confidence friday , separate from his call for a referendum on the international bailout			0
@entity122 , a fellow @entity99 lawmaker who advises @entity5 on economics , said she would support the confidence vote , saying the prime minister had been under heavy political pressure from inside and outside his party			0
international lenders are demanding that @entity1 raise taxes , sell off state - owned companies and slash government spending , which would mean firing tens of thousands of state workers			0
the @entity132 , a global association representing many of the world 's biggest banks , reaffirmed its commitment tuesday to the bailout agreement reached last week , saying it would work closely with all parties to implement it			0
the @entity33 debt crisis claimed its first @entity32 victim shortly before @entity5 announced the referendum on monday , as @entity143 filed for bankruptcy protection , leaving top @entity146 creditors holding more than $ 2 billion in debt			2
the commodities and derivatives brokerage was run by ex- sen. @entity151 , a former head of @entity152			0
@entity153 , chairman of the @entity154 , said @entity5 's referendum move had taken everyone by surprise			0
as a consequence , he said , " @entity0 is facing a credibility gap as a result of the problems that have been created both on a political level and on a financial market level			2
" @entity153 also said he saw little point in @entity5 holding a confidence vote this week if the bailout deal , which was reached after top - level negotiations in @entity33 , could be overturned by the @entity0 people just a few weeks later			1
one expert called the surprise plan for a referendum " a political gamble , which adds further uncertainty to the @entity33 debt crisis			2
" " the prime minister will be hoping for a vote in favor to strengthen his mandate , but if the @entity0 population votes against , it will leave the @entity20 and @entity0 's @entity33 partners in a very difficult situation , " said @entity174 of @entity175			1
the planned referendum casts a shadow on the hard - fought deal that would allow @entity0 to write off as much as 50 % of its debts to banks			1
the deal would wipe out 100 billion euros in @entity0 debt , half of what it owes to private creditors , and comes with a promise of 30 billion euros from the public sector to help pay off some of the remaining debts , making the whole deal worth 130 billion euros ( $ 178 billion )			2
no date has been set on the vote , although local news reports say the referendum could come in january			0
a " no " vote threatens to unravel the deal , which was greeted last week with fanfare as a way to keep debt woes in @entity0 and other @entity33 nations from spilling across other borders , threatening the 17 nations united under the euro currency			1
a weekend survey in @entity0 found nearly 60 % opposed the debt deal reached last week in @entity214			2
but other surveys have shown a more complicated picture			0
a survey carried out last week by @entity218 for the @entity0 daily newspaper to @entity220 showed a majority of @entity0 wanted a referendum on the international rescue plan , and that more would oppose it than accept it			0
but in the same survey , 70 % of @entity0 wanted to stay in the euro , according to @entity226 -- a result that may not be possible if they vote " no " on the referendum			1
" ( it ) clearly opens a can of worms because the referendum vote could go one of two ways , " said @entity230 , a senior economist for @entity231			0
" if approved , a vote of confidence in the government 's handling of the situation ... if calmer heads prevail and it can rationally be explained to the public , i would n't discount the measure being approved			0
" but , until the referendum is passed , there is added uncertainty , he said , adding , " that 's just an added headache			0
" besides the @entity0 debt - reduction plan , last week 's @entity21 deal pledged to quadruple the @entity21 's bailout fund to about $ 1.38 trillion and to raise the capital required to help cushion the region 's banks from financial shocks			2
@entity2 's @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 , @entity262 and @entity263 contributed to this report .			0
