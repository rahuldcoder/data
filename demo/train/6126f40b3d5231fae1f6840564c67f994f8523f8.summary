they were so in love			2
sports fans and sex fans alike have shed countless tears over the breakup of a man who bounces a ball for living and a woman who once videotaped herself making sexy time with @entity28 's little brother			1
but while we all acknowledge that @entity6 and @entity7 are the greatest living beings on @entity32 or any other planet , we may not all agree on what lessons to take from this sad state of affairs			1
fortunately , as the @entity37 , i 'm available to explain the five most important things you and your friends ought to learn from @entity6 and @entity7 ' impending divorce			1
providing $ 400,000 of @entity45 « t at one 's wedding does not ensure the success of a marriage			1
you need @entity49 for that			0
fish and relatives stink after three days , but spouses can last 24 times as long			0
have you ever been stuck in a car with your beloved family for more than three hours ? it 's awful , and you probably love them more than any other folks in the world			0
@entity6 and @entity7 made it work for 72 whole days			1
that 's 1,728 hours of uninterrupted togetherness ! rather than tear them down , let 's salute them for their longevity			0
considering that they probably ran out of new words after the first day , it 's pretty amazing they lasted as long as they did			0
contrary to popular belief , it 's a bad idea to marry a dude with the same first name as your mom			1
especially when @entity81 describes herself on @entity82 as " @entity81 , manager , @entity84 , lover of life , lover of christ			0
if at first you do n't succeed ... you 'll probably also fail the second time			2
like many other members of her generation , @entity6 fell in love and launched a starter marriage that did n't last so long			1
i 'm talking , of course , about her first marriage -- she married producer @entity96 when she was 19 and divorced him four years later			2
just remember , third time 's a charm			0
one 's posterior - to - waist ratio does not correlate to one 's marriage - to - divorce ratio			2
and now , let the healing begin			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity107 .			1

@entity107 : many are trying to cope with news of the @entity6 / @entity7 split
she says fans may not agree on the best lessons to take from the breakup
she *offers* five : for one , the wedding needed better *champagne* for marriage to last
for another , do n't marry someone with the same first name as your mother
