@entity1 , @entity0 -- climate change is happening faster than previously predicted according to a new @entity5 report			1
the @entity5 say climate change threat has worsened in the 15 months since the @entity7 last reported			1
bringing together some of the most recent scientific reports and data , " climate change : faster , stronger , sooner " reveals that global warming is accelerating more rapidly than the predictions made in the @entity10 published in 2007			1
one of the most concerning aspects of recent data is evidence that , in some places , the @entity17 is losing sea ice 30 years ahead of current @entity7 predictions			1
summer sea ice is now forecasted to completely disappear in the summer months sometime between 2013 and 2040 -- something which has n't happened for over a million years			0
the report 's author , geoscientist dr @entity23 told @entity2 : " @entity17 sea ice is melting much faster than everybody had been expecting			1
why ? well , maybe it 's because the positive feedback mechanisms have kicked in much quicker than we have been able to quantify			0
" positive feedback mechanisms amplify changes occurring in the climate			2
in the case of the @entity17 region there is a sort of vicious circle of warming occurring			0
white ice sheets perform an important function in moderating global temperature by reflecting heat from the sun back into space			0
but they have begun to melt as the earth has warmed			0
the result is more dark sea water which absorbs heat , which in turn warms the earth more and encourages further melting			2
globally , sea levels are now expected to rise more than double the @entity7 's most recent forecast of 0.59 meters before the end of the century			1
this will put millions of people in coastal regions at risk			0
world food production is also feeling the heat as yields of wheat , maize and barley had dwindled in recent months			0
in @entity69 , ecosystems in the @entity68 and @entity67 are believed to be experiencing their warmest temperatures since records began			0
and the @entity72 is likely to experience an increased frequency of droughts			0
the @entity5 report also highlights a 2007 study conducted by the @entity77			1
" widespread acceleration of tidewater glaciers on the @entity85 " concluded that floating tide - water glaciers on the peninsula are losing ice faster and making a greater contribution to global sea level rise than was previously thought			1
earlier this month , the @entity5 highlighted the impact that global warming is likely to have on @entity85 penguin colonies			1
according to dr tin , more @entity85 data is due to be published next year when the @entity91 publish their findings			2
scheduled for release in spring 2009 the " @entity97 and the environment " is expected to reveal more evidence of damaging climate effects on the continent			2
while dr @entity100 says that it is true that parts of the @entity85 are not warming or perhaps even cooling , the @entity99 has experienced some of the most rapid increases in warming			0
" over the past 50 years , it has warmed more than four times faster than the average rate of @entity110 's overall warming , " dr @entity100 said			1
but dr tin remains unsure whether this most recent climate data represents the beginning of a tipping point			2
" we think there are possibly tipping points ahead and some scientists , in terms of the @entity17 sea ice , think we have probably gone past the tipping point			0
but it 's very difficult to get a strong handle on , " she said			0
nevertheless , she describes her report as a " sobering overview " which " comes at a critical time during the political negotiations of the @entity130 's climate and energy package "			2
newly elected vice chair of the @entity7 and climate scientist , @entity132 endorsed the @entity5 publication			1
" it is clear that climate change is already having a greater impact than most scientists had anticipated , so it 's vital that international mitigation and adaptation responses become swifter and more ambitious , " van @entity132 said .			1

@entity5 report says climate change is happening faster than predicted
dr @entity23 : " @entity148 melting much faster than everybody had been expecting "
