it 's rare that a defendant is put on trial knowing that whether he wins or loses , chances are he 'll still spend his life in prison			2
that 's exactly the scenario @entity8 faces , as his second trial in the november 2012 killing of 17 - year - old @entity12 approaches			1
jury selection began monday morning			1
the retrial will follow and is expected to last about two weeks			0
before jury selection began , @entity12 ' parents , @entity16 and @entity17 , were outside the @entity19 , along with @entity20 , the mother of @entity21 , the unarmed teen killed by a neighborhood watch captain earlier the same year			1
" this trial speaks to me because i am that family , " @entity23 said			0
" the family that 's missing a son			0
i 'm the family that 's a victim of senseless gun violence			0
that 's the purpose of me coming here , that 's just to stand with the family , to be with the family and to show the support			0
" about 40 people gathered demanding justice for @entity12 as well as other slain african - americans , including @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 carried signs that said " @entity41 " and " is it ok to murder me because i like loud music ? " a pastor led the group in prayer before @entity12 ' parents entered the courthouse			1
the gathering promptly dispersed , but not before @entity17 thanked the crowd for supporting her son			0
" we just want to thank the country and thank you all for the wonderful support and prayers that you 've given us these last two years			0
we could not do this without you			0
we 're very grateful for every moment that we 've been on your minds and your hearts , " @entity17 said			0
she added , " whatever verdict we receive , we will be humble and abide by			0
but the verdict and the justice that we seek will always and will only come from @entity63			0
" defense attorney @entity66 expressed concern to @entity69 judge @entity68 that the rally , which " appears to be sanctioned by mr. @entity12 ' family , " could influence potential jurors			2
@entity68 responded that there is " only so much i can control , " but conceded that " it 's not helpful to us getting a jury here in @entity78			2
" he said that the court would determine what potential jurors heard and saw when they 're questioned			0
the first trial earlier this year , on what would 've been @entity12 ' 19th birthday , a @entity78 , @entity85 , jury found @entity8 guilty on four of five counts in the case			1
while @entity8 said he shot into a @entity88 full of teenagers in self - defense , he was convicted on three counts of second - degree attempted murder -- one each for firing at @entity12 ' pals , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 -- and one count of shooting into a vehicle			1
the attempted murder convictions alone carry a cumulative minimum sentence of 60 years in prison for the 47 - year - old @entity85 man			1
opinion : why prosecutor is retrying ' loud music ' murder case the 12 jurors , however , deadlocked on the final and most serious charge : premeditated first - degree murder			1
@entity8 claimed that after a heated argument over loud music at a @entity78 gas station , @entity12 threatened him and @entity8 thought he saw @entity12 produce a gun or lead pipe			1
though @entity12 had a knife in his pocket , police recovered no weapons matching @entity8 's description , and his fiancee , @entity12 , testified that @entity8 never mentioned seeing a weapon			1
following the argument , @entity8 pulled out a handgun and began firing			1
he continued firing even as @entity96 , the driver , put the @entity88 in reverse and retreated , witnesses said			0
@entity8 fired 10 shots at the suv			2
three of those bullets hit @entity12 , one piercing his liver , lung and aorta			2
' ... they did n't call 911 ' after the shooting , neither @entity8 nor @entity12 called police			1
they drove 40 miles to a bed and breakfast in @entity139 , and once there , defense attorney @entity140 said , @entity8 took his dog for a walk and @entity12 ordered a pizza and movie			1
" they had cell phones , but they did n't call 911			0
he did n't drive to a police substation , " assistant state attorney @entity148 said during the first trial			0
" that defendant put his head on his hotel pillow and went to sleep			0
" asked why he never called police , @entity8 said , " it makes sense that i should have ( contacted authorities )			2
i ca n't tell you why			0
" in the morning , @entity12 watched a news report about the shooting and the two then drove another 130 miles home to @entity164 where @entity8 was apprehended			1
what happened in the hours after the shooting may play a role in the new murder trial , as prosecutors must prove that @entity8 planned to kill @entity12			1
in the first trial , prosecutors alleged that @entity8 's actions after the shooting were indicative of his intent , an assertion @entity8 's defense attorney denied			1
@entity12 ' father , @entity16 , was certainly struck by @entity8 's actions after killing his son and expressed satisfaction in february that @entity8 would face a lengthy prison bid			1
" he is going to learn that he must be remorseful for the killing of my son , that it was not just another day at the office			0
my son will never be just another day at the office where ( @entity8 ) can leave the scene and be stoic , " he told reporters			2
awaiting sentencing @entity8 has not yet been sentenced on the original counts			2
in addition to the 60 - year minimum he faces on the attempted murder charges , he could spend another 15 years in prison on the count of shooting into a vehicle			1
while his new defense attorney , @entity66 , has n't been speaking to media , @entity140 has said his client would appeal the original verdict			0
that may explain why -- even though , pending appeals , @entity8 could spend the rest of his life in prison -- prosecutors are preparing for another highly publicized trial on the murder charge			1
to hear prosecutor @entity208 tell it , it 's about justice			0
" justice for @entity12 is as important as it is for any victim , " she said after the first trial in february			2
@entity217 legal analyst @entity216 said he can see how some people might think it defies logic to try the case again , but from @entity12 ' parents ' perspective , it makes all the sense in the world			2
" if he winds up with 60 or 75 years in jail , from a pragmatic standpoint it does n't make a whole lot of sense to retry the case , " @entity216 said after the first trial			0
" on the other hand if you 're the parents of @entity12 and you believe , as well you should , that your son 's reputation has been besmirched by this self - defense claim , the family ( might ) want a retrial , and that 's something that a prosecutor has to consider carefully			1

@entity8 charged with killing @entity12 , 17 , after argument over loud music
