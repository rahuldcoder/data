-- three years ago , i was just another @entity2 working mom when a famous @entity4 publisher , @entity5 , contacted me to write a book for @entity4 's single ladies			1
at first i was n't sure if i was the right person for the task			0
yes , i 'm ethnic @entity4 , but i 'm @entity9			2
how could i write something useful for women in @entity4 ? but after @entity5 pursued me for a year , i agreed			1
my resulting book , " @entity13 , " became a best - seller in @entity4 and has become embedded in its pop culture and urban consciousness			2
my life has also changed			0
i 've developed a burning passion for empowering @entity4 women , and i now work full - time in @entity4 's booming fashion and lifestyle media			1
all this has given me an intimate look at urban @entity4 women , their lives and their dreams			1
@entity4 women want what all women want many @entity4 women now are well - educated -- in fact , @entity30 reported that @entity2 business school enrollment is driven by women from @entity4			1
naturally , these women want to put their education to good use in their careers			2
in their marriages , they also have new dreams			0
they do n't want a traditional @entity4 marriage based on responsibility			1
reality dating shows are legion in @entity4 , and like the idealistic @entity47 in the @entity2 tv show " @entity49 , " @entity4 women want to " dream the impossible dream			1
" in short , @entity4 women today want what all women want -- great careers , true love , and maybe , a child who 's happy and successful ( most @entity4 women are still restricted to having one child under government policy )			1
sex and power are deeply intertwined in @entity4 the current generation of women is caught in a transitional moment in @entity4 history			1
for thousands of years , @entity4 society has been structured around the family unit			2
men were the heads of household , women the caregivers			0
women lived to please others			0
now , there is an epic clash unfolding in @entity4 society between women 's newfound dreams and traditional notions of a woman 's role			1
the title of my book , " @entity85 , " is an attack on the fact that women in @entity4 face brutal social pressure to marry by age 27 lest they be labeled " leftover women			2
" in @entity4 , sex and power are deeply intertwined			0
concubine culture lives on , whereby mistresses are an acceptable and even expected accoutrement for men in power			0
@entity4 social media regularly features photos of corrupt government officials with their mistresses			2
perhaps inevitably in a society where power avails men of women , sexual harassment and domestic violence are rampant			0
women 's media are the messengers of history ancient traditions are codified into a range of laws in @entity4 that are unfair to women			1
but in a culture where women always have been second - class , laws will change only when enough women recognize their own selves and say " i 'm not gon na take it anymore ! " that 's where pop media comes in			2
@entity125 wrote in " @entity126 " that @entity2 women 's magazines were the " first messengers in history to address the majority of women ... to tell them they have a right to define themselves first			1
" this applies equally to @entity4 now			0
that 's why many writers and editors who care about women 's culture are fighting to redefine beauty in @entity4 , show that strong is beautiful , and profile women who 've ignored the rules , defined their own lives , and who as a result are lovely and amazing at every age			1
abuse thrives in silence , and the only way to overcome injustice is for us all to start truly connecting with our own selves and with those around us			0
women 's media prompts the dialogue needed in order for change to happen			1
we 're all making culture now			0
it 's up to each one of us to ensure the culture we create is based on dignity and mutual respect for everyone			0
join us on @entity167 / @entity166			0

@entity4 women want what all women want : great careers , true love , maybe a child
clash between @entity4 women 's newfound dreams and traditional notions of *female* role in society
@entity4 women 's media is helping women redefine themselves
