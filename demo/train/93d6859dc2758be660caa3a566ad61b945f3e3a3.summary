an abandoned subway terminal in @entity1 is being pitched for redevelopment into a sunlit , subterranean park -- replete with 60,000 square feet of flowers , ponds and trees			1
located in @entity8 's trendy @entity7 , the vast underground space -- which is about the size of a football field -- has remained untouched since the terminal was discontinued back in 1948			1
now , a group of entrepreneurs are proposing an elaborate green makeover , in which sunlight would be " harvested " above ground and channeled into the vaults below via a network of fiber - optic cables -- creating an environment apparently filled with natural light and , in theory , ripe for growing all the foliage of a typical city park			1
" effectively , we 'd gather an image of the sky and sun at street level and distribute it underground , " said @entity26 , former @entity28 satellite engineer - turned - architect and the brains behind the idea			2
@entity26 began developing the @entity36 ( named after the old @entity1 street under which the park is planned ) after persuading the local transport authorities to give him , and co-founder @entity40 , a guided tour of its derelict carriage terminal			1
" sixty years of accumulated filth aside , i was struck by the beautiful historic qualities of the space -- with its cobblestone floors , original footway tiles and high - vaulted arched ceiling , " recalled @entity26			0
" these are all features we 'd love to see carried through , but with the futuristic addition of a fully functioning community park			0
" read related : could ' @entity55 ' really turn architecture on its head ? @entity26 and @entity40 's romantic vision includes a polished , undulating ceiling plane from which the " remote skylights " -- developed by @entity63 to filter out harmful ultraviolet and infrared light frequencies -- will flood the park with sunrays all year - round , night and day			2
according to @entity26 , the technology is " like a cross between a telescope and an endoscope " -- capturing light from the sun and then transporting it through fiber - optic cables onto a relatively small focal point			0
" of course the lighting will be supplemented with an electric supply at night and during cloudy periods ... and we 'll also need additional energy for a ventilation system , " said @entity26			0
" but for both cost and environmental purposes , any additional energy use will be as green and efficient as possible , " he added			0
comment : would you give them your support ? is the " @entity88 " project a feasible and much needed innovation or a pretty but impractical pipe dream ? tell us you thoughts in the comments section below			1
despite the possibility of this additional energy consumption , @entity40 -- who also works for an ngo promoting socially innovative applications of technology -- is resolute about the park 's eco-credentials			0
" this will be a distinctive testament to the varied applications and incredible promise of solar power , " he said			0
" it would also bring a slice of nature into one of @entity1 's least green areas , and encourage people to think about their relationship with the environment			1
" the plans have drawn comparisons with the popular @entity118 -- another park built along an old railway way line -- in this case high above the city streets in @entity1 's @entity122			1
" rather than demolish what was there and replace it with shiny new office blocks or expensive apartments , the existing structure has been re-imagined to become a sustainable space for everyone to enjoy ... and we have very similar aims in that respect , " said @entity26			0
the terminal is currently under the control of the transport authority , and they have agreed to listen to the duo 's pitch -- but made it clear they will not submit any funding for the construction of the park			2
" in the end , we will have to compete with other proposals , which will no doubt offer compelling commercial arguments for things like a car - parking lot or shopping mall , " said @entity26 , who plans to finance the entire initiative through private funding and donations			2
the duo say it 's too early to put a price on how much the park will cost to build and run , but they are currently in the process of raising $ 400,000 for a full - scale demonstration of the " skylight " technology and a thorough feasibility study regarding the structural and ventilation conditions of the terminal			1
@entity40 says that after a recent spate of community meetings , they also have the enthusiastic support of the locals .			0

a group of entrepreneurs are proposing an an underground garden for @entity1
*disused* subway terminal could be filled with captured sunlight , allowing for growth of plants
creators say plans represent *opportunity* to *introduce* nature into one of @entity1 's least green areas
pipe - dream or genuine innovation ? you tell us .
