@entity0 , @entity1 -- on a recent afternoon along @entity4 in @entity0 , @entity1 , young aspiring actors recited passages from @entity7 's @entity6 as jugglers , break - dancers , and blowers of didgeridoos displayed their skills nearby , creating a visual and aural cacophony			1
just another day in a thriving college town -- this one happening to be home to the @entity16			1
there are notable distinctions between college towns and other @entity21 cities			1
in the student - centric spots , bicycles seem to outnumber cars			1
affordable restaurants serve up authentic cuisines from all around the world			1
the streets are densely packed with businesses , making for a highly pedestrian - friendly environment			1
nature is usually accentuated : the shimmering @entity32 , backdropped by a sawtooth silhouette of peaks , forms the western edge of @entity0			1
@entity36 , @entity37 , is situated on an isthmus between two lakes that draw hordes of hikers and bikers			1
@entity43 , @entity44 , is an outdoor enthusiast 's dream			1
and do n't forget the bars			1
each of these locales offers plenty of opportunities for imbibing , many of them ideal for both people - watching and soaking in the scenery			1
it 's hard to beat sunset cocktails at @entity59 's @entity58 , where tiered decks jut from a 450 - foot - high cliff over @entity62			1
these attractions are mainly geared toward the students , naturally , but they can be readily enjoyed by those with no homework assignments or college connections			1
after all , few sports experiences can top the rafter - shaking raucousness in @entity71 , @entity72 , during a @entity74 basketball game			1
many schools benefit from world - class art collections in glittering facilities designed by marquee architects ; @entity71 's @entity79 , featuring a wing by @entity81 , tempts visitors with @entity83 , titians , and @entity85 in a way that many university-less cities can not			1
the performing arts also abound			2
most campuses host an array of dance , theater , and performing arts to rival a season at @entity95			2
this fall , for instance , the @entity97 , near the @entity98 , will host the @entity100 , @entity101 , and @entity102 so , as students zip up their backpacks for a return to the classroom , it 's a good time for any traveler to pack up a trunk and visit one of these bustling campus locations			1
just do n't count on peace and quiet if you go to bed early			2
@entity116 , @entity115 ( @entity117 ) on autumn saturdays when @entity119 is packed with 65,000 whooping fans , it may be tough to associate @entity116 with anything but football			2
but in a place named for a scholarly @entity126 city and that is home to @entity130 's columned retreat , @entity131 , paperbacks take precedence over quarterbacks , especially at @entity134			2
its tens of thousands of volumes include autographed copies of works by southern authors like @entity140			2
when not reading , residents pedal the city 's fast - growing network of bike trails			2
" i was surprised to learn @entity115 could be so progressive , " says @entity145 of @entity146			2
local taste : act the southern gentleman on the upstairs porch at @entity150 by ordering a " @entity151 " bourbon mojito			2
@entity153 , @entity154 ( @entity155 ) state capitals and colleges fit together seamlessly in a number of locales ( see @entity59 and @entity36 )			2
@entity153 nicely mixes buttoned - up government workers and dreadlocked students			2
it 's hard to miss the @entity163 -- you can see the legislative building 's sandstone dome from almost anywhere in the city			1
take a guided tour , and then stroll through the lovely conservatory and gardens			2
every @entity179 , the procession of the @entity174 parade , with participants colorfully dressed as birds , turtles , killer whales and more , weaves through downtown -- near where @entity181 draws theatergoers to its unconventional shows at the @entity184			1
local taste : though vegetarians are plentiful in @entity153 , shellfish fans are , too ; find them slurping @entity188 , from the @entity190 bay of the same name , at the @entity192			2
@entity193 , @entity194 ( @entity195 ) the music scene was fertile here b.d.m.b -- that is , before the @entity199 , which formed in @entity193 in the early 1990s			1
these days , alternative rock , country , and reggae acts -- as well as , of course , jam bands -- get crowds moving at the @entity208 , the @entity209 , and even @entity210 , where @entity211 arrives in october			1
but the best performances may lurk along the brick sidewalks of the postcard - perfect downtown , in tiny venues like @entity217 's , a former drugstore that 's now known for jazz and blues			2
when the music 's over , be sure to get a good look at the @entity224 -- planned campus and explore a @entity227 trail			1
local taste : @entity229 , who was born in @entity230 , might enjoy the " boerie burgers " at the @entity232 , a @entity234 restaurant			2
@entity59 , @entity235 ( @entity236 ) @entity235 's retro - stylish capital prides itself on turning out offbeat characters -- @entity239 and @entity240 , for starters			1
but for something truly batty , check out the @entity244 / @entity243 , where 1.5 million @entity246 free - tailed bats hang out -- quite literally			1
at dusk , from march through october , they flap off to chase insects			0
viewed from a lawn below next to @entity252 , the swarm will blot out the sunset			0
@entity59 , the so - called live music capital of the world , turns into a music fanatic 's dream each march during the @entity257			0
local taste : go for some @entity235 barbecue at the low - key @entity260 , where for $ 16.99 you can get messy with a full rack of baby - back ribs			0
sip alfresco drinks and take in the sunset at @entity58 , where tiered decks jut out from a 450 - foot - high cliff over @entity62			0
@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity16 ) college towns do n't get more scenic than @entity0 , where a 7.5 - mile bike path on old railroad beds provides wind - riffled views of @entity32			1
it 's understandable , then , that outdoor activities figure prominently here			0
rent a kayak from @entity275 to explore bays fringed with pines , or hike @entity278 to the summit of nearby @entity280 , whose bald - faced 4,083 - foot summit offers living - map panoramas			0
local taste : dine on local delicacies at the @entity286 , which offers locavore favorites like @entity1 lamb braised with green peppercorns			0
@entity43 , @entity44 ( @entity98 ) in a town that always pops up on " healthiest cities in @entity21 " lists , bike trails are abundant and outdoor options are endless			1
the @entity295 begins along @entity296 in @entity43 , in the foothills of the @entity298 known as the @entity299 , for their sharply angled faces			0
rent climbing shoes from @entity302 , whose in - store museum features dozens of ice axes and an early pair of @entity308 skis			0
local taste : the @entity310 , built in the 1800s as a @entity313 retreat , now serves up salmon with salsa verde on a wraparound porch			0
the on - site summer - camp - type cottages provide eagle - eye views toward the flatlands			0
@entity322 , @entity323 ( @entity324 ) if coffee shops define a good college town , @entity322 has the competition beat			1
some host bands , others show art , many sell fair - trade blends , and most offer a space where it 's okay to relax for hours			0
" it 's kind of a universal hangout place , not just for professors and students , " says @entity336 , a barista at @entity338			0
many residents prefer the crackle of vinyl to @entity346 ; pick up some lps at the well - stocked @entity348 on @entity349 , @entity322 's festive commercial strip			1
in the heart of campus , the 61 - bell carillon provides the tunes atop 307 - foot @entity355 , which also offers stunning panoramas of @entity357			0
local taste : for brunch , fit in with the crunchy crowd by ordering a tofu scramble at @entity362			0
for some local suds , stop in for pints at the festive @entity365			0
@entity366 , @entity367 ( @entity368 ) if a town 's name references trees , it 's a good bet nature will figure prominently			1
at the lush , 123 - acre @entity375 , gravel paths wind past blazes of yellow , pink , and white peonies and the occasional reclining student			0
the " arb " is also frequently the setting for @entity7 stagings			0
slake your thirst amid more flora at @entity387 , whose garden is ideal for enjoying any of the 10 local microbrews on tap			0
local taste : apart from the various @entity395 sports teams , the pride of @entity366 is @entity396 , where the rooftop vintage neon sign reads " @entity398			0
" and that 's what you 'll get , of every type , from new @entity246 chiles to oysters from @entity404 , @entity405			0
@entity36 , @entity37 ( @entity406 ) like oases in deserts , college towns in the @entity408 can be refreshing splashes of hustle and bustle amid the plains			1
the @entity37 capital squeezes caf√©s , art galleries , and the @entity418 -- designed @entity419 onto an invigorating pedestrian - only thoroughfare			1
in warm weather , the museum 's roof is the setting for concerts and films			0
elsewhere are found lively neighborhood block parties , like the @entity428 , which annually offers rock bands on multiple stages			0
and there 's no shortage of aquatic fun : the city is located on an isthmus between a pair of glittering lakes			0
local taste : @entity439 is the region 's slow - food mecca			0
@entity71 , @entity72 ( @entity442 ) yes , there 's a fine clutch of @entity446 classroom buildings around a shaded , picturesque quad , but during the winter months , everyone 's attention is fixated on the @entity450 , home to the powerhouse @entity74 basketball team			0
come november , tickets that have n't been snapped up by students are available to the public			0
die - hards check out the 8,000 - square - foot , year - old @entity456 , which doubles as a de facto shrine to alum @entity458 ( old jerseys included )			1

" during the off - season , browse for art at @entity465 , owned by @entity466 , wife of former senator @entity467			0
