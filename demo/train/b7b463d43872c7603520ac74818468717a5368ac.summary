the 26 - year - old " @entity1 " began his hunt for an eighth @entity11 title with a swift victory over @entity13			1
@entity1 broke the world no. 63 four times on his way to a straightforward 6 - 4 6 - 2 win to cruise into the third round , extending his record to 2 - 0 against the @entity21 -- who he also beat in the second tournament of his comeback from knee injury in @entity26 two months ago			1
