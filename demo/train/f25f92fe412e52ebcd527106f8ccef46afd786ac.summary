@entity0 -- recognizing that the " internet of 2012 is vastly different from a decade ago , " the @entity2 on wednesday announced changes to strengthen privacy for children online " in this ever - changing technological landscape			1
" the revisions to the @entity9 , also known as the @entity10 , which was originally passed in 1998 , will make it more difficult for children 's personal data to be collected by mobile phone apps , smartphones and tablets			1
parents will have greater control over the information that websites and online services can collect from children under 13			1
apps , or applications , are software programs that mobile phone users can purchase and install on their devices			0
" the new @entity9 rule captures the new online reality ... and puts companies on notice that they must comply with the law , " said sen. @entity28 , chairman of the @entity29			0
@entity28 , d - @entity36 , told reporters at a @entity39 news conference that he 's been " stewing inside " about this issue for a while , and he warned that third parties will be held liable for personal information they collect from children			1

" the @entity2 says one of the proposals will " close a loophole that allowed kid - directed apps and websites to permit third parties to collect personal information from children through plug - ins ( software ) without parental notice and consent			1
" " parents should be the gatekeepers to decide whether others can collect information , " said @entity2 chairman @entity62			2
