why is it that at the beginning of the 21st century the @entity2 world seems stuck in time ? why are most arabs still ruled by kings or military dictatorships ? and specifically , why has the most populous @entity2 nation , @entity10 , been governed by one man for nearly three decades ? president @entity12 , a former general , came to power in the aftermath of @entity16 's assassination in october 1981			1
he has ruled @entity10 ever since under a state of emergency			2
last week , @entity12 's regime extended for another two years a draconian emergency law that permits police to detain individuals indefinitely , prohibits unauthorized assembly and severely restricts freedom of speech			1
we @entity24 should care about this state of affairs			0
@entity12 's regime exists in part because our tax dollars subsidize this dictatorship to the tune of several billion dollars a year			1
we also support the @entity32 royalty			1
and although president @entity34 and previous presidents have often spoken eloquently about the need for democratization , @entity10 's elections are anything but democratic			1
why does nothing change ? i spent virtually my entire childhood in the @entity42 , and though it is not my home , i worry about it as if it were my home			0
i mourn for it , i fear for it -- and i also greatly fear it			0
modernity , if not ever completely defeated , seems to have been put on hold throughout much of the @entity2 world			1
a worn - out , 82 - year - old pharaoh still reigns in @entity10			2
royalty still rules in @entity52 and @entity32			1
islamists still seem to be winning hearts and minds in a political vacuum			0
the fact is that the @entity10 of my adolescence in the 1960s was a more democratic and secular society than today			1
my father was an @entity24 foreign service officer stationed in @entity62 from 1965 - 67			0
an army colonel , @entity63 , was @entity10 's virtual dictator			1
but @entity63 had at least been elected president in 1956			2
he was a wildly popular and populist politician throughout @entity10			2
@entity16 was never as popular as @entity63			2
he had catered to the @entity53 in the aftermath of @entity63 's death , thinking they were not dangerous , and ending up being killed by them			1
neither he nor @entity12 could have survived a truly democratic election			2
@entity63 became an autocrat , but at least he offered the @entity2 a secular vision			1
even today , @entity63 remains emblematic of a lost era when hope still existed among @entity2 of all classes and tribes for a modern , secular and progressive @entity2 nation			1
@entity77 and articulate , @entity63 exuded a quiet intelligence			2
his colleagues knew him to be incorruptible			0
he had no personal peccadilloes , aside from smoking three packs of cigarettes a day			0
his good friend the newspaper editor @entity84 claimed that @entity63 loved watching @entity88 's syrupy @entity87 tale , " it 's a @entity90			1
" his favorite @entity24 writer was @entity92			0
he spent an hour or two each evening reading @entity24 , @entity93 and @entity95 magazines			0
his closest political enemies at home were the @entity98 , political theocrats who then attracted an insignificant following			0
today , the @entity98 would undoubtedly win any democratic election in @entity10			2
but back in the 1960s , most young @entity2 men aspired to a secular modernity			1
they wanted to be engineers or doctors or lawyers -- and they admired , like @entity63 did , @entity24 culture			2
i lived in @entity62 's upscale suburban community of @entity112 , about eight miles south of the city on the eastern bank of the @entity115			0
i am startled to realize now that another resident of @entity112 was the young @entity117			0
in 1965 , the future doctor and no. 2 leader of @entity120 was attending @entity112 's state - run secondary school			0
he was exactly my age			0
and like me , @entity117 used to watch @entity124 films on an outdoor screen at the @entity126			0
@entity117 once aspired to a career in public health			0
his ambitions were the same as most young @entity2 men in the @entity63 era			1
even then he was a practicing muslim			0
and his religious sensibilities did not become politically radicalized until after @entity63 ordered the execution of the @entity98 's leader , @entity136 , in 1966			1
but i would argue that @entity117 and other young men would never have taken the road to jihadist terror had it not been for the june 1967 war			1
@entity141 , the @entity143 - educated , @entity142 philosopher , described @entity63 's defeat in the june war as a " lightning bolt " and a " shock " to the @entity2 ethos			1
@entity63 's humiliation spelled the defeat of the idea of a secular path to @entity2 modernity			1
@entity63 's once powerful notion that the @entity95 - speaking peoples of the @entity42 could unite under the banner of a progressive @entity2 nationalist movement was now discredited			1
over time , political @entity53 moved into this political vacuum			0
@entity117 himself wrote in his 2001 memoir that the " @entity162 " -- the june 1967 defeat -- " influenced the awakening of the jihadist movement			1
" @entity117 today is hiding in a cave in @entity165 , or dodging drone missile attacks in @entity167			0
someday he will be a dead man , along with his pitiful co-conspirator @entity168			0
the jihadists do n't have any thing real to offer the @entity2 of the 21st century			1
they ca n't put bread on the table in this era of globalization			0
@entity175 believes the jihadists have already lost : " there may be intermittent battles in the decades to come , with many innocent victims			0
but the number of supporters of armed @entity182 is unlikely to grow , its support throughout the @entity2 @entity53 world will likely decline			2
... september 11 signaled the last gasp of @entity182 rather than the beginnings of its global challenge			0
but if @entity175 is right , the new generation of young @entity2 men and women must find hope for their lives elsewhere			2
and so long as tired old kings and pharaohs smother their rights to democratic elections and free speech , the jihadists will still offer a desperate alternative			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			0

@entity203 : why does @entity12 still rule in @entity10 , royalty in @entity52 , @entity32 ?
@entity203 grew up in @entity10 under @entity63 , who envisioned secular path to modernity
he says @entity63 's defeat in june 1967 war was a shock to @entity2 ethos , end to his dream
bird : jihadists have nothing to offer but a desperate alternative to dictatorships
