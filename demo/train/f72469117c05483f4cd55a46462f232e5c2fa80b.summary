-- last month , @entity1 of @entity3 fame launched @entity4			0
amid the hoopla of the launch -- attended , for some reason , by @entity8 and @entity9 -- @entity1 told an anecdote about meeting his business partner , @entity11 , 15 years ago in a chat room , saying , " there 's something exciting about bringing spontaneity to the @entity16			1
all of your interactions online are constrained by the people you already know			2
" time.com : chatroulette 2.0 ? @entity3 founders launch @entity4 video chat so far , @entity4 has n't exactly been a hit			2
apparently people do n't feel constrained by interacting with the people they know -- they feel comforted by it			2
but what , exactly , did happen to the chat rooms @entity1 so fondly remembers ? i talked with @entity30 , the longest - running employee at @entity31 and its current chief architect			1
his relationship with the company started in 1988 , before it was @entity35			0
back then it was called @entity37 , a project commissioned by @entity39 and a company called @entity35 to connect @entity42 and @entity43 computers			0
the beta test was dubbed " @entity47 " and for @entity30 , a teenage fan of @entity45 ( bulletin board systems ) , it was an intriguing opportunity			0
he recalls a " little frontier town " where you could initially recognize almost every screen name you came across			0
when the main chat room filled to capacity , necessitating the creation of @entity56 , the community celebrated			2
it only took 23 people to fill a chat room			1
" i know for myself , personally , i found it fascinating , " says @entity30			0
" the @entity45 world , it tended to be a one - line experience -- you were the sole user of the service , you could send email , you could leave messages , but it was n't interactive in real - time in the same way			1
so the experience of going into a chat room and getting a response a couple of seconds later from someone who was in the same chat room was just really cool			2
" time.com : 12 unique compouters , tablets and gadgets that are just around the bend slowly , the service grew , expanding to support @entity81 and eventually @entity82			0
the chat product , called @entity84 , had a variety of rooms for people interested in such topics as genealogy and strategy games			1
@entity30 remembers a ticker dubbed " @entity92 , " a kind of virtual community newsletter that would let people know when certain chat rooms had a special guest or were discussing certain topics			1
@entity30 moved from beta tester to full - time employee in 1992 , when the service -- now officially called @entity35 -- went public			2
the company was positioned perfectly for the onset of the @entity104			0
@entity82 3.1 was released , making personal computers both more affordable and easier to use			0
and , despite our memories of the slow - dialing modems of the ' 90s , connecting to the @entity109 was faster than ever at the time			2
" in the ' 80s , if you had a 2400 baud modem you were pretty hot stuff , " says @entity30			0
" 2400 baud is painful			0
people talk about their cellphones being slow now ; a slow cellphone might be 256k or 512k , so if you think about something being 100 times slower than that , it 's ridiculous			2
so you started getting to the 9600 and 14,400 baud modems that made the speeds a little more comfortable			0
" time.com : @entity123 , meet @entity125 's @entity124 participation in chat rooms started to snowball ; as more people used them , the variety of chat rooms increased , attracting even more people			1
then , in 1996 , @entity35 opened the floodgates by introducing a monthly flat rate instead of charging by the hour			0
for $ 19.95 a month , users could now linger in chat rooms for as long as they wanted			1
the late ' 90s , according to @entity30 , was when chat rooms hit their peak			1
just how powerful was @entity35 during this time ? @entity139 , product manager for @entity31 , shared this little story on @entity141 : " when we launched @entity31 4.0 in 1998 , @entity31 used all of the world - wide cd production for several weeks			1
not a single music cd or @entity148 was produced during those weeks			0
people signed up in droves			2
@entity31 's subscriber base grew to 17 million in 1999			1
this is the era that many people , myself included , remember most vividly			0
as a gawky kid entering high school , chat rooms were a haven from the awkwardness of real human interaction			1
i 'd use them to discuss punk bands like @entity164 with other teenagers , to play the chat room - equivalent of @entity167 , and talk to what i very much hoped were actual girls			0
around 2000 , however , i found myself drawn more to @entity170 ( @entity170 ) than i did to @entity31 's chat rooms			1
launched in 1997 , @entity170 became widespread once it was made available to non-subscribers in 1998			0
time.com : @entity31 's thoroughly modern aim then in the 2000s , the rise of dsl and cable modems made paying @entity31 a monthly fee for internet access seem increasingly unnecessary			1
@entity180 launched in 2002 , @entity181 in 2003 and @entity182 in 2004			0
massively multiplayer online role - playing games ( @entity184 ) like @entity185 made gaming in chat rooms seem antiquated			1
time.com : @entity189 at 40 : catching up with founder @entity190 there were , in short , a lot more options for people who wanted to interact online			0
@entity31 's walled garden was officially dismantled in 2006			1
chat rooms were available to @entity170 users until 2010 , when @entity31 announced , " since usage of @entity200 has declined significantly in recent months , our focus has moved to other products			1
" today , chat services such as @entity203 and @entity204 ( @entity205 ) are popular , but chat rooms as they existed in the 1990s are mostly a relic			1
so , is the chat room dead ? @entity30 does n't think so			0
" i do n't think people have necessarily stopped using them -- there are just different ways of expressing the same concept now , " says @entity30			0
" now people on @entity182 will start a thread on someone 's @entity217 and really start interacting with one another			2
it 's a different visual format , it 's organized differently , but its really the same concept we had around the chat room			2
" time.com : five years ago today , the @entity225 went on sale yes , that 's true , but to me the experience just feels different			2
that 's what @entity1 was getting at when he talked about the " spontaneity to the @entity16 " during the @entity4 launch			0
in the ' 90s , i constantly interacted with people known to me only by their screen names ; today , i only interact that way in comments sections and on @entity238 , and only occasionally			1
that 's not necessarily a bad thing			0
i 'm nostalgic for @entity31 chat rooms , but would i use them if the company brought them back ? no. but that does n't mean some entrepreneur out there is n't working on something that captures the same spirit , albeit without the same hegemony @entity31 enjoyed			1
in the meantime , i 'll have to settle for talking with strangers on @entity238			1
anybody want to talk about punk bands from the late ' 80s and early ' 90s ? this article originally appeared on @entity0 : @entity31 's longest - running employee on the history of @entity31 chat rooms			1

@entity31 chat rooms , popular in the 90 's and early 00 's , are less so today thanks to new *technology*
chat rooms helped the users communicate *rapidly* with others like themselves
today , *social* networks ' chat services let people *exchange* in real time with existing friends
still , some networks like @entity238 and linked in thrive on creating bonds between strangers
