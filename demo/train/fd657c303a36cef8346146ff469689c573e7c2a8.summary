@entity0 -- a week after the @entity3 ruled in favor of an @entity6 law that restricts early voting , attorney general @entity2 argued the decision will disproportionately affect @entity9 , many of whom " heavily " use early voting			1
" it is a major step backward to allow these reductions to early voting to go into effect , " @entity2 said in a video message posted monday			1
" early voting is about much more than making it more convenient for people to exercise their civic responsibilities			2
it 's about preserving access and openness for every eligible voter , not just those who can afford to miss work or who can afford to pay for childcare , " he continued in the video , which was posted on the @entity22 's website			0
the law cut down the state 's 35 - day early voting window by seven days			1
proponents say that reducing in - person early voting would help create uniformity across the state 's counties , and voters would still be able to vote by mail during that seven - day window			1
but critics argue the @entity44 - backed law will make it more difficult for minorities to vote			2
opinion : why does @entity44 fight early voting ? while the @entity22 was not a part of the lawsuit , it filed a brief in the case in july			2
a federal judge had previously said the law was unconstitutional and placed a hold on it so it could n't go into effect			0
that decision was upheld by a federal appeals court judge			0
but the @entity3 's 5 - 4 decision allowed for the law to go into effect immediately			1
early voting in @entity6 now official starts this week			1
in his video message , @entity2 said early voting is " heavily used " by african - americans because the practice is popular among people who have a hard time getting to the polls due to childcare responsibilities , hourly salaries , and reduced access to transportation			2
" restricting voting hours in ways that would disproportionately impact minority communities is not only unnecessary and unwarranted -- it is out of step with our history of continually expanding the franchise , " he said			0
" it is contrary to our fundamental values of equality , opportunity , and inclusion			0
and it is an affront to millions who have marched , and fought , and too often died to make real @entity90 's most basic promise			0
" @entity2 announced late last month he 'll soon be resigning from his post , but will stay on until a replacement has been confirmed .			0
