-- a rat believed to be extinct for 11 million years , a spider with a foot - long legspan , and a hot pink cyanide - producing " dragon millipede " are among the thousand newly discovered species in the largely unexplored @entity6 region			1
the " dragon millipede " is among the 1,068 new species discovered in the @entity6 region			1
the region , including parts of @entity13 and five other countries , is home to 1,068 species found between 1997 and 2007 , according to a @entity18 report released this week			1

the hairy , nocturnal , thick - tailed rat , which resembles a squirrel , had been thought for centuries to be extinct			0
" there is a certain amount of shock because our scientists will sometimes see something that does n't fit anything they know , " said @entity30 , director of the @entity18 's @entity31			1
" they run through a catalogue of wildlife in their brain , asking themselves , ' have i seen this ? ' " perhaps a more startling discovery than the rat was a bright green pit viper scientists spotted slithering through the rafters of a restaurant in @entity51 in @entity52			0

scientists are still trying to determine if they have uncovered thousands of new invertebrate species			2
scientists are discovering new species at a rate of two per week , said @entity30 , who said the reason for publishing the report now was twofold			1
" we realized that we should highlight these discoveries in part because of the legacy of war and conflict in the region , " she said			2
" there 's an urgency with the threat of development in the @entity6 countries			1

" people are taking climate change more seriously and even the ruling junta have a forestry ngo			0
