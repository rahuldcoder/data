it 's an almost too - perfect metaphor			1
this week brought news that a @entity4 member of @entity5 has decked out his office in the style of the mansion in " @entity9 , " the @entity11 series that @entity12 -- struggling against income inequality of historic proportions -- somehow ca n't get enough of			1
maybe it 's because we can relate			2
the @entity12 is fast becoming a real - life example -- or worse -- of the upstairs / downstairs inequality portrayed in the show			1
and it 's @entity4 policies that got us there and are making it worse			1
on monday , @entity24 , a reporter from the @entity25 , toured the @entity9 - inspired office of @entity12 rep. @entity27 , @entity28			1
@entity24 described the outer office : " bright red walls			2
a gold - colored wall sconce with black candles			0
a federal - style bull 's - eye mirror with an eagle perched on top			2
" " it 's actually based off of the red room in ' @entity9 ' " a woman at the front desk told him			1
an interior designer from a company called ( no joke ) @entity44 showed the reporter @entity27 's private office			1
it 's another red room , " [ t ] his one with a drippy crystal chandelier , a table propped up by two eagles , a bust of @entity53 and massive arrangements of pheasant feathers , " he wrote			2
@entity27 's decorator said the choice to imitate @entity9 's ostentatious halls was made because the congressman is " fresh - minded and forward - thinking			1
" um , sure , for the 1870s maybe -- when the inequitable accumulations of the robber barons and the subsequent @entity63 were but a twinkle in our forward - thinking eyes			0
now under some scrutiny for accepting the free services of the @entity72 ( @entity68 in @entity69 asked the @entity73 to investigate ) , @entity27 insists he 's never even seen " @entity9			1
" but he 's sure lived it -- if not in his brand spanking new aristocratic office than as a resident of the @entity4			1
here 's " @entity27 - er " : income inequality in the @entity12 right now is worse than in @entity79 , the era depicted in " @entity9			1
" the richest @entity12 today take home a higher share of our nation 's income than the aristocratic lords and ladies of 1920s @entity79			1
what 's more , low - wage employees -- such as fast food restaurant workers and @entity92 cashiers -- take home a smaller share of our nation 's income than the butlers and cooks did back then			0
that unequal reality is even more gaudy than @entity27 's office			1
and it is without question the direct result of @entity4 policies			1
tax cuts for the wealthy and the deregulation of business have ensured that the share of wealth enjoyed by big business and the top 1 % has continued to climb , even in the recession			0
in fact , the top 1 % suffered only one - third of the income loss during the recession but have basically reaped all the gains of the recovery			0
meanwhile , despite overall economic growth and the growth of worker productivity , most @entity12 have seen their wages stagnate or even decline			2
the working poor in @entity12 today may have wireless telephones , automobiles and indoor privies , but they still very much live in basement of the @entity12 economy			2
when the @entity127 gov. @entity127 of @entity128 cut taxes with a severity and speed never before attempted by any other state , he was actively cheered on by conservatives			0
his stated goal was to get the tax rate down to zero			0
the result ? the economy in @entity128 plummeted			0
job growth has failed to keep pace with the national level			0
giant revenue gaps led to drastic cuts in public services such as schools			0
credit rating agencies even cut the state 's previously stellar bond rating			0
and 100 @entity4 leaders in @entity128 endorsed a @entity150 candidate to replace @entity127 as governor because , they said , @entity127 's tax and budget cuts had so severely hurt the state 's working class and middle class families			2
narrowly re-elected , @entity127 announced recently that he will now raise taxes in @entity128 to fix the state economy			0
as if the failure of @entity4 anti-tax , anti-government economics had n't already been proved by the record wealth and corporate profits at the top juxtaposed against record numbers of poor people and low - wage workers relying on food stamps , @entity128 should be seen as the final nail in the coffin			2
wealth from the top does not " trickle down " to the bottom to lessen inequality			0
it 's time for @entity4 to do more than talk			2
it 's time they admit that their precious economic theories are actually the poison sickening our economy			0
republicans in @entity5 might have a @entity185 scandal on their hands with the revelations about @entity27 's office			1
but it 's the massive moral crisis that should be weighing on their shoulders , hearts and minds			0
@entity4 need a new , populist economic theory that helps the majority of @entity12 and not just the elite 1 %			1
but to get there , they 'll need a fundamental shift of perspective and priorities to say the least			0
maybe start with redecorating .			0

@entity201 : @entity4 rep. @entity27 had his office decorated like " @entity9 "
she says it 's the perfect metaphor for @entity4 policies that have brought @entity12 inequality historically worse than in the " @entity9 " era
