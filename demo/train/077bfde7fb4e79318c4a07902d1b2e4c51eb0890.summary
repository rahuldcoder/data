according to the ministry , the review " has ended the long - held view that mixed close ground combat units would have an adverse effect on cohesion between troops			1
" but it calls for more research into the physiological demands placed on those in close combat roles before a final decision is made on allowing women in			1
ground close combat units are defined as those where " the primary role is to close with and kill the enemy			2
" the potential impact on women 's health of serving in such units should be fully examined , the review said			1
