-- @entity1 may have started out as a @entity3 knockoff -- like @entity3 he 's a playboy entrepreneur , a mega-rich industrialist who inherited the good life before channeling his anger into homeland security -- but there 's no doubt that in the movies @entity9 has put clear blue water between @entity1 and @entity12 's grim , angst - y @entity3			1
@entity13 and frivolous , an exhibitionist who likes the glare of public attention , he 's a light knight with a thick skin			2
traditionally , protagonists are punished for their hubris , and the first " @entity1 " movie went through those motions			2
but @entity9 enjoys @entity1 's arrogance too much to eat humble pie			1
he 's always resisted the idea of playing the repentant			0
@entity1 may have developed a conscience after his run - in with the @entity29 in the first movie , and even turned monogamous for @entity31 ( @entity32 ) , but he 's still a flip , cynical hedonist at heart			1
so what are we to make of the anxiety attacks that cripple mr. @entity1 in @entity40 's " @entity39 " ? apparently he 's freaked out after his mind - blowing experiences with " @entity43 " last summer ( though no one else seems concerned that @entity46 gods are at large in the cosmos , and when the going gets tough you do wonder why he does n't pick up the phone and ask his new buddies for help -- not the only plot hole by any means )			1
@entity40 , who wrote " @entity57 " way back when and more recently helped restore @entity9 's career with " @entity56 , " may have hoped that a sliver of self - doubt would crack open @entity1 's emotional armor and restore the human face behind the mask , but @entity9 shows no interest in introspection			1
@entity40 systematically strips @entity1 of almost everything he has -- gadgets , gizmos , his strongest suit -- but the actor merely shrugs it off			2
there 's a lot of faulty wiring this time round , technology that seems as flawed as its inventor , but if his problems are largely of his own making @entity1 remains supremely unfazed , always primed with a quip and a smirk			1
@entity9 may as well be playing " @entity79			0
" @entity1 's arrogance and narcissism come back to haunt him in the form of spurned entrepreneur @entity83 ( @entity84 ) and a larger - than - life terror - monger by the name of " @entity88 " ( @entity89 )			1
a cross between @entity91 and @entity92 -- but with the rumbling , tumbling vocal stylings of a @entity96 evangelist , the @entity88 brings out the best in @entity98 , who has n't had a role as juicy as this one for donkey 's years			2
@entity88 is a worthy nemesis , an extravagant showman like @entity1 who can hack into broadcast feeds at will , and claims credit for a string of bombings across the @entity108 when @entity109 ( @entity110 ) is caught in one blast , @entity1 takes it as a personal affront -- and impetuously calls fire down on his own head			1
there 's an off - the - cuff quality to the storytelling here -- the movie rewrites its own laws of physics whenever it 's convenient to do so -- which by rights should be a bigger problem than it is			0
but @entity40 and / or co-writer @entity126 know how to write snappy dialogue			0
even if they do n't mean a thing , their scenes have plenty of zing			0
they also have an ace up their sleeve , a trump card that puts a giddy spin on the third act at just that point where both the previous movies began to run out of stream			0
to say more would be to spoil the fun			0
" @entity39 " has plenty to offer on that score			0
it 's a confidently tongue - in - cheek piece of blockbuster engineering , sweetly calibrated to @entity9 's cavalier appeal and to @entity89 's oddball interjections , a battle royale of rampant egos in which acting speaks louder than words .			0

in the new film @entity1 is *pitted* against @entity88
@entity1 's arrogance and narcissism come back to haunt him
the love story continues between @entity31 and @entity1
