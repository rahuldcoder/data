-- since leaving government almost a decade ago , my analysis of matters @entity1 has been , well , annoyingly negative			1
and the reason ? best summed up in a line often attributed to @entity8 but actually uttered by @entity9 : " well , who are you gon na believe , me or your own eyes ? " what i see is an angry , broken , dysfunctional region that wants to transcend itself and resolve the conflicts that hold it back , but just ca n't			0
and i 'm not at all sure there 's a whole lot @entity19 -- that indispensable nation -- can do about it			1
here are my predictions for 2013 on some of the key issues			1
this year 's theme is muddle through -- neither breakthroughs nor breakdowns			1
@entity27 : 2013 -- the so - called year of decision -- war with the mullahs who rule @entity27 or the grand bargain -- will produce neither			1
president @entity33 will go to extreme lengths to avoid a military strike aimed at @entity27 's nuclear program and will not greenlight an @entity38 one			1
without that go - ahead , the @entity38 will continue to agonize but not act			1
and the mullahs will be smart enough not to brazenly give either @entity40 or @entity41 an easy excuse to strike			0
bottom line -- 2013 will be a year of diplomacy , not war			2
to borrow a conceit from my friend @entity49 reporter @entity47 , 2013 will witness the @entity51 game in which cat and mouse in the old cartoon continue a never - ending game of almost gotcha			2
who knows ? if the @entity19 and @entity27 try hard enough they might actually bump into one another and reach a limited deal to keep @entity27 a few more years away from getting enough uranium to make weapons			1
but if you 're looking for final closure on this one , go talk to dr. @entity67 @entity69 - @entity38 peace : the sun , moon , and stars really are n't aligned on this one for a big breakthrough			1
where should i start ? the january 22 elections in @entity38 will likely produce another @entity78 government that has no incentive to destroy itself politically by tackling the big issues like @entity40 and refugees , certainly not with the @entity27 nuclear issue still open			1
and the @entity83 -- @entity84 and @entity86 's @entity85 ( who can barely bring himself to talk about a two - state solution ) are n't in the giving mood either			2
@entity91 president @entity90 is too weak to initiate much			0
bottom line -- the @entity19 will try and may succeed in getting the @entity38 and @entity93 into a process to talk about borders and security			1
but the two - state solution is likely to remain too hard to achieve but too important to abandon			0
@entity33 will probably not be earning his @entity99 peace prize -- yet			0
@entity69 spring / winter : this is going to be a long movie			0
after all , it took the @entity19 a century and half and bloody civil war to even begin to reconcile the promise of equality contained wiithin the @entity107 with the legitimization of slavery contained in the @entity110 , and we 're still not there yet			2
still , nowhere in the @entity69 world do the trend lines look that hopeful			0
neither in @entity86 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , let alone @entity117 , do the @entity69 have the three elements required to set their experiment with democratization and pluralism in the right direction : leaders who put the nation before their own political and religious parties ' interests , institutions that are seen as inclusive and legitimate , and a mechanism to ensure that polarization does n't spill out into the streets in violence			0
bottom line -- buckle your seatbelts			0
no immediate convulsions and catastrophes			0
but in the new @entity69 world with islamists rising , the political space for the @entity19 is going to get a whole lot smaller and the dangers to our diplomats much greater			2
the key question is at what point the bell will begin to toll for the kings and emirs in @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 , too			0
the good news : but all is n't totally gloomy			0
we 're out of or getting out of the two longest wars in our history , we 're reducing our dependence on @entity69 oil , @entity154 has been weakened , and while we 're not safe we 're certainly safer here at home -- at least from foreign terrorists			0
bottom line -- with the notable exception of killing @entity166 , president @entity33 has n't had any spectacular successes in foreign policy , but more important , he has avoided spectacular failures			0
if he can continue to keep us out of trouble , particularly at a time when we need to be focused on repairing @entity19 's broken house rather than chasing around the lands of @entity175 trying to fix everybody else 's , he 'll have done pretty well			1
and who knows , if he 's patient , maybe he 'll even be able to turn one of those @entity1 migraines and root canals into an opportunity or two			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			2

@entity186 : predictions for dramatic change in @entity1 are likely to be *wrong*
he says 2013 will be a year when @entity19 avoids military action against @entity27 's nuclear program
progress on peace *negotiations* between @entity38 and @entity93 seems unlikely , he says
@entity184 : the lack of dramatic *developments* should be considered a *positive*
