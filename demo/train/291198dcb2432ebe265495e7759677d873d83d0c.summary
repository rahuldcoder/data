-- the @entity1 may be awash with cash , but that did n't stop the region 's stock markets being swept up in the global gloom that engulfed investors around the world this week			1
traders at the @entity12 in happier times -- this week @entity10 's main index fell four percent			0
the region 's share markets tumbled in a @entity17 wave of selling that started in the @entity19 and quickly spread to @entity20 and @entity21			0

" what you 're seeing now is that international investors who might have lost money in the sell - off in the @entity19 and @entity21 cashing in where they 've made some profits to staunch their wounds			1
" on tuesday , the @entity44 shocked the market with its own measure to stem the sell - off			1
it cut interest rates by 75 percentage points to 3.5 percent , its biggest single cut in since october 1984 , and the first between scheduled meetings since the 9/11 attacks in 2001			1
markets in the @entity1 clawed back lost ground , but it also forced the hand of the region 's central bankers whose currencies are pegged to the dollar			1
@entity23 , the @entity62 , @entity63 , and @entity64 all cut key interest rates in tandem with the @entity19 , and @entity67 was expected to follow			1

" we are seeing a policy from the @entity44 , which is fully appropriate for the @entity19 economy , being imported into the @entity89 , " says @entity84 , @entity85 for @entity86			1
" unfortunately what is good for the @entity19 is not good for the @entity89 economy , " he says			2
" inflation is already high and it 's already a concern , but something that concerns me the most is not so much the present inflation , it 's the inflation expectations we 're seeing			0
" he says the @entity89 governments need to act , and if they 're not prepared to drop their peg with the dollar , they must consider revaluing their currencies			2
" the choice to proceed with a one - off valuation of the currencies would help to drain some of the liquidity out of the system			0
it would send a message to the economy participants in the region that there is a response to the inflationary pressures			0
" while this week 's turmoil in the world financial markets may have been a curse for the @entity89 economies , it could also be viewed as a potential blessing for the region 's sovereign wealth funds ( @entity124 )			1
as little as two weeks ago , they were in the market buying shares in leading @entity19 banks @entity129 and @entity130			0
for them , the sell - off has created more buying opportunities			1
" where there is more risk and less certainty and less leverage available these guys are going to come in and support the stock market			0
from what we 've seen , they 're certainly ready to go out shopping , " says @entity29 from @entity30			0
the chief of the @entity145 confirmed as much on the sidelines of the @entity147 in @entity148 , @entity149			0
@entity150 is reported to have said he viewed the sell - off as a " pure investment opportunity " , citing the financial and real estate sectors as areas of interest			1
after much speculation , @entity23 has confirmed it is considering launching its first sovereign wealth fund , a $ 6 billion investment pot accrued during the oil boom			2
however , the vice governor of the @entity163 's @entity162 is reported to have said @entity23 " can live without one " if there 's " endless debate about abuses			0
" read more about calls for greater @entity169 transparency @entity84 from @entity86 says the flow of funds from the @entity89 to the @entity172 will help to correct the current imbalance in the global economy			1
" there 's a shift of wealth			0
@entity20 and the @entity1 are becoming richer and more important global powers			2
it 's a fact and it 's happening , " he says			0
" the surplus countries need to recycle their income into the deficit countries			0
