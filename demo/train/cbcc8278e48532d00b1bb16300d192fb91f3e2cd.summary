-- she 's the daughter of a @entity3 , fashion designer of everyone from @entity5 to the @entity8 @entity7 team , recipient of a medal from @entity10 , and counts @entity11 among her friends			1
from all appearances , @entity14 's life has been a charmed one -- not that she necessarily sees it that way			1
fame has followed the second child of @entity20 and @entity22 photographer wife @entity21 from the moment she was born			0
and it 's been both a blessing and a hindrance			2
as @entity14 was awarded this year 's prestigious @entity27 from the @entity28 , @entity0 spoke to the mother - of - four about sustainability in a notoriously " unaccountable " fashion industry			1
parents ' influence @entity0 : you had very famous role models -- do you think that helped you , or do you think that was actually a hurdle ? @entity14 : it certainly opened a lot of doors and certainly closed some minds			1
so i think there was a balance			0
@entity0 : what do you think was the biggest inspiration you got from your mother , @entity49 ? m : i learned a lot from her ethics			0
both my mum and dad [ former @entity3 , @entity20 ] are known to be vegetarians , world rights activists and environmentalists , and that definitely came into my place of work			0
once you have children it adds another layer of responsibility to what you 're doing			0
you have to be a role model to them so it makes you question your actions -- in a good way			0
@entity71 @entity0 : what is the biggest challenge you 've encountered getting where you are now ? m : early on , when i wanted to go back to @entity82 and start my own fashion house , a very well thought - of executive in the industry said to me : " name one female designer that 's come from @entity77 that has had any kind of global success			1
" i wanted to prove him wrong			0
obviously there have been great women from @entity77 in design , but actually there are fewer than i thought			0
so that was a bit of a hurdle for me			0
from day one i 've never worked with leather or fur			2
i do n't work with @entity95 , and i 'm very conscious in the sourcing and manufacturing of fashion			1
that 's a hurdle , that 's a challenge , but it 's a worthwhile one			2
@entity0 : do you feel a lot of pressure from the industry because you chose to go down the " sustainable fashion " road ? m : it 's been difficult , it continues to be difficult , but i 'm ok with difficult , it 's what keeps me on my toes			1
i 've had people say to me : " you 'll never sell handbags , you do n't work with leather and leather is luxury			1
" to me it 's the complete opposite , leather is everywhere , it 's so cheap a material , it 's so mass produced			1
over 50 million animals a year are killed just for fashion			1
for me it does n't have a luxury element to it			1
@entity0 : so you 're comfortable flipping that notion on its head , that leather is luxury ? m : lots of things have been around for a long time , that does n't mean they have to stick around forever			1
when you 're in design it 's your job is to change , to push , to modernize			2
the fashion industry , is not really as accountable for some reason			2
we 're not expected to have to answer to the fact that it 's not sustainable to kill that many animals for shoes and bags			1
and it 's not necessary ! ninety percent of the people who come to my stores have no idea i do n't work with leather			1
being told no @entity0 : you get very steely when you talk about people telling you you ca n't do something			2
m : does n't everyone , who likes being told they ca n't do something ? anyone can do anything they want , if they really want it			0
i 'm not going to pretend i did n't come from a privileged starting point			0
i 'll always admit that it was easier for me to question people telling me i could n't do something because i had a pretty nice place to fall back on			0
so maybe that afforded me a little more spark and fight			0
i 'm learning as i get older , that you do n't have to try to fight everything from a man 's place			2
i guess i got here for a reason , it was n't because i was a woman			0
more : @entity179 's billion - dollar idea			0

@entity14 talks about the influence of her famous parents on her fashion *career*
says she does n't see leather as luxury , as it 's mass produced
wins prestigious @entity27 from @entity28
believes it 's not sustainable to kill so many animals for shoes and handbags
