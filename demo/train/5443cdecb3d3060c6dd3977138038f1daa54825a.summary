-- amid public outrage over government corruption , unemployment and a lack of basic services , @entity2 's parliament approved the appointments of eight new ministers to the @entity10 on sunday -- but key security posts remain empty			1
the lawmakers greenlighted candidates tapped by @entity2 prime minister @entity14 for ministries that include electricity , trade and municipalities			2
the first female minister was approved for the @entity10 to oversee women 's affairs			1
candidates for the ministries of defense , interior and national security have not been named , though parliamentary speaker @entity26 told his colleagues that @entity14 promised to submit nominees for those posts in the coming days			1
meanwhile , hundreds of angry demonstrators took to the streets of @entity32 -- about 100 kilometers west of @entity33 -- on sunday , protesting against the government 's inability to provide basic services			1
similar demonstrations have been held across @entity2 in recent weeks , inspired by uprisings in @entity39 , @entity40 and other countries in the region			2
in december , after nearly a year fraught with political infighting , the parliament voted to approve @entity14 's new government , despite the vacancies			1
the long - awaited legislative action came more than nine months after a hotly disputed national election that threatened to inflame the country 's deep sectarian tensions			2
the government composition is inclusive of @entity2 's major ethnic and sectarian groups , brought together by a fragile @entity54 - backed power sharing deal agreed on in november			2
but it is clear that sectarianism remains , as the posts were divided along ethnic and sectarian lines			0
the prime minister has three deputies -- a @entity61 , a @entity62 , and a @entity63 , representing the three largest entities in @entity2			0
@entity65 , who has been one of @entity14 's critics , is the @entity63 deputy			1
he had been barred from politics because of alleged ties to the @entity70 party , the outlawed political movement of late @entity2 leader @entity72			0
@entity73 lifted that ban in december			0
on sunday , the parliament failed to hold a vote on three vice presidents under the power - sharing deal after some lawmakers had reservations on a @entity61 candidate			0
at the end of 2011 , the @entity54 is set to withdraw all of its troops from @entity2 as part of a bilateral agreement with the @entity33 government			0
it is too soon to predict whether that will happen or whether the @entity54 and @entity2 will negotiate an agreement to keep some @entity54 soldiers there after next year .			0

security posts in @entity10 remain *unfilled*
protesters have rallied in recent weeks over lack of basic services
