describing it as a " day that has been a long time coming , " president @entity0 made modern history monday by announcing the creation of a monument to honor the late labor and civil rights activist @entity7			1
the @entity9 becomes the 398th unit in the @entity12 system , and the first honoring a @entity13 born later than the 1700s , the @entity8 told @entity15			1
it 's no coincidence the move comes less than a month before @entity18 , as the president maintains a strong lead among @entity21			0
a big turnout among @entity13 supporters in states where the race is close could help @entity0 win re-election against @entity28 challenger @entity27			1
opinion : @entity0 hits a foul by honoring @entity7 the president spoke at a ceremony in @entity33 , @entity34 , on land known as @entity9 , where , from the 1970s until the early ' 90s , @entity7 lived and led his farm worker movement			1
decades ago , @entity0 said , when @entity7 began his farm worker movement , " no one seemed to care about the invisible farm workers who picked the nation 's food -- bent down in the beating sun , living in poverty , cheated by growers , abandoned in old age , unable to demand even the most basic rights			1
" " @entity7 cared , " the president said			2
" in his own peaceful and eloquent way he made other people care too			0
" @entity7 's organized labor marches and other protests , including a boycott of table grapes , led to " some of the first farm worker contracts in history , " @entity0 said			1
" let us honor his memory , but most importantly let us live up to his example			0
" @entity7 's movement " was sustained by a generation of organizers who stood up and spoke out and urged others to do the same , " @entity0 said			1
@entity7 , @entity0 said , believed that " when someone who works 12 hours a day in the fields can earn enough to put food on the table -- maybe save up enough to buy a home -- that lifts up our entire economy			1
" @entity0 acknowledged that there 's still " more work to do " and " the recession we 're fighting our way back from is still taking a toll -- especially in @entity13 communities which already faced high unemployment and poverty rates			1
" earlier monday , the @entity80 , a coalition of 30 latino organizations , lauded the move			0
@entity7 , who died in 1993 , embodied the principle " that individuals can accomplish more as a community than they ever could on their own , " said @entity83 , executive director of the @entity84 , in a statement put out by the leadership agenda			2
the monument includes 120 acres , @entity12 spokesman @entity89 said			2
@entity0 's order puts property under federal protection that includes a visitor 's center , the @entity98 ' legal aid offices , @entity7 's home with his wife , @entity101 , a memorial garden containing his grave , and other buildings , the @entity91 said			1
@entity89 said no sculpture is planned			0
the monument , in the @entity106 , is the fourth designated by @entity0 under the @entity108			1
@entity0 's decision to set aside the land as a national monument also sends a political message to environmentalists -- a key group of voters , as many strongly supported him in 2008			2
the @entity117 , which endorsed @entity0 in 2008 and for his current @entity91 run , has not always been happy with the president 's environmental record			0
as debate raged in 2011 over air quality regulations and proposed construction of a transcontinental oil pipeline , @entity117 president @entity121 said the administration had been " caving " to industry			0
@entity117 spokesman @entity128 said monday that establishing the @entity7 monument stands as " further proof of president @entity0 's commitment to our special places across the country and we hope he continues to use that authority			1
" @entity7 an inspiration to president 's campaign slogan and movements the @entity7 family donated certain properties to the federal government so that the monument could be created			2
beginning tuesday , the @entity8 will take steps to prepare it as an official site , @entity89 said			0
it will become " one of those places that everyone should visit , " he said , " part of our shared cultural heritage			0
" the land includes property that was once @entity7 's home , which was added to the @entity156 last year			0
interior secretary @entity157 called him " one of the heroes of the 20th century			0
" @entity160 , president of the @entity161 , said at the time , " for my father , @entity162 was a personal refuge from bitter struggles in agricultural valleys and big cities , a spiritual harbor where he recharged batteries , drew fresh inspiration and prepared for the battles ahead			0
it was a place where many dedicated people spent years of their lives working with @entity7 for social justice , inspiring generations of @entity178 from all walks of life who never worked on a farm to social and political activism			2
" @entity184 , a @entity15 contributor , wrote a column last year noting that many sites around the country are named for @entity7 , and suggesting that that " campaign " may have run its course			0
still , he wrote , @entity7 " was a great @entity178 who helped bring fairness and dignity to the fields and the workers who toil there			2
before @entity7 and the union came along , there were no collective bargaining rights for farm workers , no toilets or clean drinking water in the fields , and little public awareness about pesticides and other dangers that workers must endure to put fruits and vegetables on our table			1
he helped change all that			0
