-- satire and mockery are part of politics			1
sometimes they attack not the policy but the person , going from nuanced to nasty			2
but surely not " everything goes			2
" promoting violence and applauding abuse -- there 's just no excuse for it			1
the latest uproar occurred at the @entity15 , when a rodeo clown wearing an @entity18 mask invited the crowd to cheer if they wanted to see " @entity18 run down by a bull			0
" " as they were bringing the bulls into the chute and prepping them , " @entity21 told @entity22 , " ... they bring out what looks like a dummy			0
the announcer says ' here 's our @entity18 dummy , or our dummy of @entity18			1
they mentioned the president 's name , i do n't know , 100 times ... " @entity38 was there with his wife and a foreign exchange student who got a lesson in @entity44 political " civility			2
" the reaction was bipartisan			0
@entity47 gov. @entity46 , a and sen. @entity48 , both @entity49 , weighed in with disapproval			0
and lt. gov. @entity51 , a @entity52 , said on @entity53 he found the performance " disrespectful			0
" that 's an understatement			2
" we are better than this			0
what are we to make , though , of a @entity60 website , suspiciously resurrected by an anti-hillary pac ? the @entity62 sent out tweets to reporters in hopes , i suspect , of stirring up the red meat base , get publicity , and solicit money			1
it provocatively asked journalists , " have you slapped @entity60 today ? " first posted 13 years ago , the site shows a cartoon of @entity60 's face			1
when a button is pressed , a hand slaps her so hard she reacts like a bobble doll , her head bouncing from side to side as her eyes cross			0
the " @entity84 , " which hosts the " game , " says they are " a grass roots , nonprofit organization			0
" @entity87 's @entity86 did some research and found its treasurer , @entity89 , is a @entity52 campaign finance consultant and former member of the @entity92 administration			2
the @entity62 defended itself and posted a link to a " @entity95 " website			2
the pac is n't contrite , saying on its website , " we did n't see the liberal media bemoaning this " @entity95 " game when it came out ! they only care when it 's the candidate they support for president			1
" there 's something suspicious about the " @entity95 " site -- a paucity of comments , just 19 in 2008 and only two last year , indicates a set - up			2
a little more research revealed that the " @entity95 " is hosted on a computer at the same address in downtown @entity114 that hosts a " @entity116 " and " @entity18 " site			0
we can perhaps relegate the " @entity118 " anonymous owner to the fringe			0
but what are we to say when a former administration official and current campaign consultant to one of the major parties promotes violence against public figures ? it does n't matter if the website -- or rodeo clown -- encourages violence against a @entity131 or a @entity52 , a male or female			1
it 's one of the few true evils in politics			1
those who promote or approve " slapping " or " shooting " or " running over by a bull " any public official should be shamed and shunned			1
virtual violence needs to be denounced and never justified because it 's political			1
still , given the extent of domestic violence -- 25 % of @entity44 women will experience domestic violence in their lives -- encouraging people to slap or abuse female elected officials is particularly pernicious			1
slapping women so hard their heads bobble is not a game , not even virtually			2
we need to go further , and condemn activities that show no respect for elected officials			0
@entity160 @entity44 rep. @entity160 of @entity162 ' @entity161 issued an invitation to the rodeo clown to appear at a rodeo in his district			0
" liberals want to bronco bust dissent , " @entity160 said			0
" but @entity169 value speech , even if its speech they do n't agree with			0
" this is n't about liberals or conservatives , congressman ; it 's about respect for elected officials , and coupling violence with ridicule			1
it 's one thing to use free speech to parody or satirize a politician , and another to couple violence with a deliberate showing of disrespect			1
when @entity189 was campaigning in his home state of @entity47 ( where the rodeo clown performed ) , he took questions from a high school audience			0
a teenage boy asked him a question about their town councilman , called him , " our local yokel			0
" @entity189 lit into the boy			0
politics is a noble art , @entity189 said			2
it 's difficult to forge consensus and lead fighting factions for the common good			2
but this is what politicians do			0
the boy was chastened , and apologized			0
knowing , however , that a public scolding by a man of his stature could affect the boy 's self - esteem for a long time , @entity189 talked with him after the assembly , and invited him to write and tell him about his grades			1
they corresponded until the boy graduated college			0
we have to make our civic discourse civil again			1
we have to recognize that virtual violence masquerading as ridicule is vicious ; it 's a toxic atmosphere we allow by our silence			1
we hear a lot about what 's wrong with @entity114			1
what 's wrong is n't @entity114			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity233 .			1

a website , @entity60 , invites the public to slap a cartoon face of @entity238
@entity233 : promoting violence and applauding abuse is going too far , even in politics
she says it 's wrong to promote " slapping " or " shooting " of any public official , female or male
@entity233 : we have to make our civic discourse civil again ; virtual violence is toxic for all of us
