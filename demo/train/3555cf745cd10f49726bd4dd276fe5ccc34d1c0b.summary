-- as a second - generation caterer , i would ordinarily be peacock proud and hyena happy about the prospects of anyone getting married			0
yet when i saw the obese coverage around the wedding announcement of @entity9 's @entity8 and his fianc√©e , @entity11 , i felt it was sickening to watch			1
there was no one television broadcast or cable network that was more egregious than the other			0
frankly , all were shameful with the level of attention given to the announcement of next year 's nuptials			2
it 's wrong for anyone to suggest that prince @entity8 is n't a newsmaker , but this wedding is more entertainment than politics or hard news			1
yet this was the lead story on @entity31 's evening newscast ? really ? it was more perplexing considering the announcement was reported on the same day that president @entity34 awarded the first @entity35 to a living soldier since @entity37			1
with the @entity39 engaged in two wars , and so much attention being put on our soldiers , it made perfect sense for the national media to turn everyone 's attention to one of our own , staff sgt. @entity48 of @entity49			1
after the royal engagement coverage , how can today 's journalists seriously complain about the softening of news and about more @entity39 caring about gossip and photos of celebrities walking down the street to buy a cup of coffee rather than paying attention to the news that truly affects their lives ? look , i get the mammoth ratings from the wedding of @entity67 and princess @entity68 in 1981			1
but what we have seen this week has been ridiculous			0
more opinion on topics in the news in the media we often talk about news judgment			1
it is all subjective , based on the person or persons who make the decisions in each respective newsroom			0
i can guarantee you that if i had my own tv show or was an executive producing one , the royal wedding would n't have made it into the first block			0
no doubt it would have been mentioned , but it would have been beyond me to put a wedding announcement of a royal couple from another country at the top of an @entity39 newscast			0
longtime journalist @entity95 recently blasted the opinion - driven tv shows on @entity98 and @entity99 , and @entity101 sen. @entity100 of @entity102 went so far as saying the two should be shut down			0
frankly , i find the latter to be nonsensical , but it is important that we sometimes step back and say , " are we contributing to the dumbing down of the public by virtue of some of our dumb news decisions ? " let me be clear : there is a place for sports , entertainment and lifestyle - related stories			2
i disagree when someone suggests that such stories are n't news			2
they are news , just a different type of news			0
but there is such a thing as overkill , and when it came to the royal wedding announcement , my brothers and sisters in the media embarrassed themselves with the over-the - top coverage			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity132 .			2

@entity132 : media coverage of engagement of prince @entity8 was over the top
he says it 's an entertaining story but did n't *deserve* top *billing* on the news
journalists ca n't complain about the public 's taste in news if they hype *trivial* events , he says
