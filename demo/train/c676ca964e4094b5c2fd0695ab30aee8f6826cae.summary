-- as @entity2 continues the slow rollout of a tool to let users search out others by using common interests or other personal information , the site emphasized thursday that minors will get special privacy protections			1
@entity11 capitalizes on @entity2 's massive bank of data about its users , or " social graph , " to seek out friends , or other users who have made their information public , using information about them			1
so , for example , you could seek out friends who " like " director @entity23 to make an invite list to see " @entity32 " friday night or remind yourself which of your friends are over 21 and live in @entity28 , @entity29 , to do some bar - hopping while you 're in town			2
but privacy advocates are worried			2
while @entity11 wo n't show you any information that you could n't see otherwise , it does pull all that data together in one place in a way that could have some creepy uses			1
say , searching for the names of girls who attend a certain middle school			1
that 's the sort of thing @entity2 aims to prevent			2
details including birthday , school , hometown and current city will only be available about users under 18 to their friends and friends of friends			1
and friends of friends will only be able to see them if they , too , are under 18			1
" what we really wanted to do was try to identify things that could be even more sensitive for minors -- that would identify them by their age and location , " @entity55 , @entity2 's manager of @entity56 , told @entity0 thursday			1
" those kind of things are more sensitive and we wanted to really make sure they had an even more restrictive experience			0
" of course , she noted , the extra protections only kick in if minors are honest about the age they give to register for the site			1
" this is true across @entity2			0
it 's really important to us that minors represent their real age , " she said , urging parents to make sure their children are doing so			1
" if they tell us they 're 25 , they 're not getting these protections and a lot of other protections we offer			1
" separate from @entity11 , @entity2 already limits some content posted by minors to " @entity84 " only , even if the young user has made it public			1
the site 's minimum age is 13			0
the tool was announced last month by ceo @entity90			0
the new search feature lets you draw connections between people , their profile information and their interests on @entity2			1
in theory , it 's a good recipe for finding recommendations for doctors , businesses , products , tv shows or bands			0
it can also be used to find people that fit a specific profile , such as " men over 30 who live in @entity111			0
" users will be able to seek out people who are n't their @entity2 friends using the tool			2
but the only information they 'll see are things that a user has posted as " public " to the site			0
@entity11 currently has only been made available to a handful of early testers			1
but some of them have used it in ways they say raise privacy concerns			0
@entity129 tech blogger and " gadget geek " @entity128 created a blog called " @entity132			0
" while some are humorous ( people who like both the anti-gay marriage @entity135 and openly gay actor @entity137 ) others suggested something more troubling			0
for example , he shows a search for family members of people of @entity145 descent who like @entity146 , the religious movement banned in @entity145			2
or one for @entity148 men living in @entity149 , @entity150 , who are romantically interested in other men			0
( @entity153 is illegal there )			0
the searches could then be refined to see photos of the users , their friends and places they 've worked			2
@entity2 has emphasized privacy settings to keep such information from being publicly visible and said they 're continuing to fine - tune the tool as it rolls out			0
in december , @entity2 overhauled it 's privacy controls , adding a handful of features while simplifying and clarifying how existing features work .			0
