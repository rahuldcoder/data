-- former secretary of state @entity1 is on a national tour to promote her new memoir , " @entity4			1
" but her journey has been unusually bumpy			0
her recent gaffes about being " dead broke " or supposedly unlike the " truly well off " have made people wonder if she 's really in touch with ordinary @entity9			0
and then there 's a legal case from her past cited in her book that makes one question whether she violated the attorney 's sacred oath to never betray a client 's secrets			1
the attorney - client privilege and its corollary duty to zealously advance the interests of even guilty clients form the very foundation of trust between lawyer and client			1
@entity27 appeared to cavalierly toss these obligations aside in an interview she gave in the early 1980s			2
in 1975 , the year in which @entity1 married @entity27 , she took on the defense of 41 - year - old @entity34 , who was accused of raping a 12 - year - old girl			1
in @entity27 's memoir , she proudly discusses her role in the case , demonstrating impressive legal skills for a young attorney fresh out of @entity41			1
opinion : why @entity27 's comments matter i was beginning my legal career as a prosecutor in @entity47 during this time and it is clear to me that @entity27 's legal tactics were quite consistent with those used by experienced and ethical defense attorneys of that era			1
today 's preachers of political correctness , many of whom heartily endorse the @entity27 candidacy , may be shocked at the details of the future senator 's forceful attack on the 12 - year - old rape victim in the @entity34 case , but times were different then			1
for example , while seeking to compel a psychiatric examination of the sixth grade victim , @entity27 submitted her own sworn affidavit saying she had : " ... been informed that the complainant is emotionally unstable with a tendency to seek out older men and engage in ... fantasizing ... she has in the past made false accusations about persons , claiming they had attacked her body ... she exhibits an unusual stubbornness and temper when she does not get her way			2
" the @entity27 affidavit stated that a " child psychology " expert advised her that " children in early adolescence tend to exaggerate or romanticize sexual experiences and that adolescents with disorganized families , such as the complainant , are even more prone to such behavior			2
" the language here would score a perfect 10 on the scale of political incorrectness in 2014			0
the " disorganized families " are obviously just ordinary poor people with maybe a dash of single - mother household thrown in for good measure			0
and the 12 - year - old girl is " stubborn " and has a " temper			0
" really ? is that a problem in girls ? opinion : petty attacks on @entity1 just wo n't matter in her book , @entity27 describes her daring visit to a " bombed - out " ( read : " @entity114 " ) @entity110 neighborhood to obtain the services of a renowned expert in blood analysis			1
this expert 's reputation pushed a nervous prosecutor into believing that his key piece of corroborating evidence -- blood and bodily fluids on the victim 's underwear -- would be thrown out of court			0
without this evidence , which would have sealed @entity34 's fate , the prosecutor folded and accepted a plea to a lesser count			0
the result was that the man accused of rape that @entity27 defended served only about a year in prison for an offense worth , even in 1975 , a 15 - year state prison sentence			1
after one short year this " rootless " ( @entity27 's word ) drifter was back on the street			2
while all this may sound horrible to the nonlawyers of the world , in fact everything @entity27 did as defense counsel at the time appears to have been ethical and proper			1
@entity27 's defense focused on the child 's lack of believability and on throwing out the physical evidence based on the boneheaded prosecutorial destruction of the remaining testable blood - stained cloth			1
looks like good lawyering so far			0
when looking at this case , the press has generally focused on @entity27 's " inappropriate " laughter in an interview with an @entity159 journalist in the early 1980s			1
demonstrating a truly tin political ear , she had consented to being tape - recorded			0
in listening to the tape , it is apparent to me that @entity27 was not laughing about getting a man accused of rape off the hook , but rather at the ineptness of the prosecutors			1
on tape , she may also have been struggling to bond with the reporter , who often initiates the laughter			0
this type of shoptalk and gallows humor often takes place behind closed doors among criminal lawyers and prosecutors			0
but nobody tape records the talk , nobody talks this way " on the record " to reporters			0
even the sleaziest of criminal lawyers do n't generally brag about getting a man accused in the rape of a child off the hook			1
it might make attendance at local @entity195 meetings and " @entity196 " more than a little uncomfortable			0
lawyers have an obligation to provide a strong defense to all whom they represent , even those who committed crimes			2
the @entity203 designed an adversarial system requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt and the right to counsel			0
opinion : how @entity1 flubbed the wealth question @entity27 performed her role as defense counsel to an unpopular , indigent client with skill and competence , affording him the constitutional rights cherished by @entity9			1
so it is sad really to see her throw this all away and apparently betray the secrets and interests of her client for the sake of telling a good story to a reporter			2
but that is exactly what she did when during a subsequent interview ( also in the 1980s ) she revealed that @entity34 had taken and passed a polygraph test			0
she said on tape that she has " forever " lost her " faith " in polygraph tests			0
what @entity27 really may have been saying here is that her client lied in claiming innocence when he took the polygraph test because he was really guilty			2
in other words , she appears to have outed @entity34 as a liar and a rapist			0
by framing the story in this way , @entity27 violated not only the attorney - client privilege but also her obligation to fully represent the interests of her client as required by the attorney 's " @entity243			1
" it is utterly improper for a defense attorney to reveal a client confidence in this way			2
as a veteran teller of legal " war stories , " my advice to @entity27 is if you are going to tell one , leave out the child rapist case			2
@entity27 may have handled the case tactics well , but the way she talked about her client raises a serious question about her devotion to legal ethics in her early years of practice			1
we can only hope that the experience she has accumulated in public life has taught the former secretary of state that a devotion to ethical conduct and fidelity to the interests of those she represents are critically important character traits .			0

@entity274 : @entity1 defended a man accused of rape early in her career
@entity274 : she violated the attorney 's sacred oath to never betray a client 's secret
he says @entity27 behaved properly and ethically as a defense counsel in the case
@entity274 : but one wonders if she can truly represent interests of those she represents
