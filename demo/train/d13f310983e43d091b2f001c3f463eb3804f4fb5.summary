-- @entity1 says a hack that exploited some web browsers was responsible for a flood of porn , violent images and other graphic content that spread across the site over the past couple of days			1
spokesman @entity10 said @entity1 's security team had been working to identify the cause of the spam and that , by tuesday afternoon , " we have eliminated most of the spam caused by this attack			1
" " we are now working to improve our systems to better defend against similar attacks in the future , " @entity10 said in an e-mail			0
earlier tuesday , @entity20 , a consultant with web security firm @entity21 , said that " explicit and violent " images had been flooding the @entity23 of @entity1 users for the past 24 hours or so			1
@entity20 wrote on the @entity21 blog that the images included hardcore porn ; photoshopped images of celebrities , including teen pop star @entity30 , in sexual positions ; " extreme violence ; " and at least one image of an abused dog			2
" what 's clear , " @entity20 wrote , " is that mischief - makers are upsetting many @entity1 users and making the social networking site far from a family - friendly place			2
" several @entity0 staffers reported seeing some of the images by tuesday morning			0
@entity1 's @entity10 said that users were tricked into pasting malicious script into their browser url bars , causing them to unknowingly share the offensive content			2
he said no data or account information was compromised during the attack			1
the blog @entity50 reported that the social - media giant had been quietly taking down the images for most of the day tuesday			0
writer @entity53 said a request for comment on the images merely got a reply thanking her for " flagging " the images			0
" the fact that these photos spread for as long as 48 hours unchecked [ shows ] how much @entity1 relies on individual users to flag inappropriate content : people were commenting on the images more than flagging them , " she wrote			1
users were , understandably , distraught			0
" seeing a dead dog on my @entity1 news feed ... ...			2
. officially deactivating it , " said one @entity72 user in a post collected by @entity21			0
" i saw a dead dog , @entity30 [ performing a sex act ] and a naked grandma , " said another			0
" @entity78 to delete facebook			0
" the @entity1 statement said the site has built a mechanism to shut down pages sharing the links and contacted people affected by the attack with information about how to protect themselves			1
the site advised users never to copy and paste unknown code into their browser bars , always use up - to - date browsers and use the " report " links on @entity1 to report suspicious activity when they see it			1
@entity1 did not say anything about who may have been behind the attacks			2
with questions still abounding , speculation on the @entity101 turned -- as it often does in online hacking cases -- the controversial " hacktivist " collective @entity104			1
a group claiming allegiance to @entity104 announced it was going to make november 5 " @entity107			0
" that day came and went with little noticeable activity			0
but last week , an @entity104 - affiliated group announced in a @entity111 video that it had created the " @entity113 virus , " a sophisticated tool that would attack @entity1			1
a handful of @entity72 feeds widely acknowledged as being run by @entity104 members had made no mention of the @entity1 posts tuesday morning			1
at least two members had previously distanced themselves from @entity1 , saying it was doomed to fail and that @entity104 is not a cohesive group with unanimously approved goals			1
" using a simple @entity1 account , the worm can be carried into other accounts with little or no interaction , " an automated voice says in the video posted on the account " @entity126			2
" " we did not expect the intensity with which this would spread			0
" the video claims the worm can be controlled remotely and that once it 's fully understood it " will use this to its advantage against corruption			0
