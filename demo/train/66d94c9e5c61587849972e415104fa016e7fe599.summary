-- a @entity1 showing people dancing on the floor of the @entity4 near the end of its legislative session is causing a bit of a stir			1
@entity9 , 60 , an ireporter known as @entity11 , said she shot the video the afternoon of july 25 during a break in the second - to - last day of the session			0
that night , the @entity15 passed a restrictive abortion bill , and the @entity4 approved controversial voter @entity18 legislation			1
the @entity1 was originally titled " @entity23 " and suggested @entity20 lawmakers were doing a victory dance after a contentious session			1
the ireporter later changed the headline to " opinion : really ? on @entity28 's voters rights were suppressed and women 's rights were assaulted "			0
within a couple days , the video racked up nearly 100,000 page views and 31,000 people shared it on @entity34			0
state rep. @entity35 , a @entity20 , told @entity0 that the musician playing in the video is his former legislative assistant , @entity36 , who is leaving for music school in the fall			1
the young woman performed a few classical numbers and finished with some bluegrass			0
the man dancing in the video is state rep. @entity45 , a @entity20 , and his dance partner is the principal clerk of the @entity4 , according to a report from @entity0 affiliate @entity49			1
a few others are seen taking pictures or clapping			0
@entity9 was in the public gallery of the @entity4 to document the proceedings			1
she has also attended most of the weekly demonstrations dubbed " @entity55 , " organized by the @entity56 to voice anger about a key part of the state 's @entity20 agenda			2
@entity62 gov. @entity61 has dismissed @entity64 criticism that he is only pushing a conservative agenda			2
@entity9 acknowledged the music and dancing were unrelated to the passage of any bills but said any celebration on the floor was " totally disrespectful and inappropriate " given the gravity of issues the @entity74 was discussing that day and earlier in the session			1
" i thought that it pretty much summed up the whole session , how out of touch the legislators had been and the disconnect with their actions to the reality of the people 's lives , " she said			0
" they 're making such sweeping changes that are ... hitting people of all walks of life really hard			0
" @entity35 said in an e-mail to @entity0 that he received appreciative notes from @entity64 representatives as well as republicans about the young musician 's performance			2
" we were n't discussing any issues			1
during that day we handled several dozen bills			0
... i think the claim that it was inappropriate is silly			2

rep. @entity35 dismisses any criticism
@entity35 says lawmakers were n't " discussing any issues . it was a recess "
