-- yes , trying to lift 5,000 pounds of cargo to orbit is rocket science -- and it 's very hard			2
early tuesday evening , an @entity6 rocket , built by @entity7 , and its @entity9 cargo ship exploded almost immediately after launch			1
yet as disappointing as this incident is , it should not be treated as a sign that @entity15 's partnerships with the private sector are flawed			1
this was a technical error , and it should be treated as one			1
after all , this was only the fifth launch of an @entity6 rocket , and there is a higher risk of explosion with relatively new rockets than there is with those that have been used for many years , where the bugs have been worked out earlier , often through failures			1
@entity6 , as one of several new rockets being commercially developed , signals a new , important way of doing business in space that must be given the chance to mature			1
since the 1950s , rocketry has been the purview of the federal government			0
only through what may eventually be seen as fortuitous poor planning -- building an @entity42 and then canceling the shuttle transportation program originally intended as the taxi to said station -- has the private sector really stepped in , albeit with an anchor tenant			2
" fix lift , " meaning bringing down cost - per - pound to orbit and being able to launch on demand ( or at least close to it ) has been the no. 1 recommendation in the spate of space studies that have littered @entity55 since the 1980s			1
working with the private sector is nothing new			2
indeed , development of a product , sector or even geographic region -- which has been most successful when the government invests seed money and then turns development over to the private sector -- has been going on for decades			2
back in 1925 , the @entity64 , under which companies were paid for transporting the mail , provided the private sector an incentive to develop commercial airplanes			2
in addition , government forts and soldiers provided protection so the railways could be built and the @entity75 developed			0
yet until recently , space has been anomalous in its development , remaining tied to government funding , bureaucracy and politics , and consequently stifling incentive and entrepreneurship			0
@entity7 is one of two companies hired to take cargo to the @entity42 after the shuttle fleet was retired			0
the other is @entity89 , or @entity89			0
both companies developed rockets to carry out that task			0
tuesday 's ill - fated flight was to be @entity7 's third in a series of eight flights under a $ 1.9 billion contract with @entity15			1
the first two were successful			0
@entity89 will fly its next contracted flight in december			0
hiring private companies to provide launch services is a new way of doing business for @entity15 , one that should be encouraged and continued			1
it is the way of the future in space given that @entity15 budget 's has not kept up with external and self - imposed programmatic expectations since the @entity109 years			1
if low @entity111 orbit launches can be taken care of by the private sector , government funding to @entity15 can be used in pursuit of more ambitious goals , including human spaceflight			1
meanwhile , low @entity111 orbit launches by private companies will become routine , although we 're not there yet			0
after the @entity6 explosion , @entity7 stock reportedly fell about 15 % in after - hours trading			1
but while investor concern is understandable to a degree , it also reflects the public 's view -- and so investors ' view -- of space travel as routine			0
the reliability figures for old standby rockets makes it seem that way , but new products have bugs to be worked out			0
problems are expected and ( barely ) tolerated in day - to - day technology , but apparently not in rockets			1
luckily , there were no injuries from exploding rocket debris , though there was damage on the ground that will need repairing			0
and the loss of the @entity6 cargo posed no danger to the crew of the @entity42 where it was headed			1
there was nothing critical on board , and an unmanned @entity158 progress spacecraft successfully launched shortly after the @entity6 failure , carrying almost three tons of food , fuel and crew supplies			2
teams at @entity15 and @entity7 are already busily at work determining the cause of the failure			2
in the meantime , a little show of support for @entity169 entrepreneurship seems in order			0
because when they find the cause of the failure , they will fix it and move forward .			0

@entity6 rocket explosion a technical error , *writes* @entity178 - @entity177
risk of explosion is higher with relatively new rockets like these , she says
hiring private firms to provide launch services is new for @entity15 , she adds
