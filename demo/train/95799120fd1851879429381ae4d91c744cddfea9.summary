-- to contemplate @entity3 turning 50 on sunday is to witness one 's youth floating out with the tide , the water as merciless in its mission as @entity3 was in his prime			1
he is in the sweet spot of the old " @entity16 " sketch featuring @entity10 , " @entity11 , " about a guy who was older and wiser , and who obsessed about people looking at his gut			2
@entity3 has been laid low these days because the team he owns , the @entity17 , are one of the @entity19 's worst , and because he has been terrible at building a franchise			1
there is no doubt some schadenfreude at work here , with those who could n't defeat @entity3 as rival players or executives , or those who covered the league and watched the deferential treatment @entity3 and the @entity30 received			1
they now delight in burying him			2
what a bunch of morons			2
the end game : how sports stars battle through retirement we all led comfortable lives because of @entity40 : me , all the sycophantic tv guys and writers in @entity44 , everyone who worked at @entity49 in the ' 90s , everyone who played against him and who wrote about him			2
that does n't mean you canonize the guy ; it means you acknowledge that his excellence contributed directly to your well being , like the @entity57 driver who thanks the guys who designed the car			0
the @entity19 in the time of @entity40 was at its zenith as a cultural force and a ratings behemoth , capable of drawing in what television people call " casual viewers , " who did n't know a pick and roll from a pimento roll , but who nonetheless turned on @entity40 and the @entity30 when they were winning championships			0
athletes tend to get watered down with time , their rough edges rubbed out by biographers and historians who often fail to apply the rigorous discipline of their craft to sports , so much do they want to remain fans			0
@entity85 's alcoholism was never front and center until it had almost killed him			0
@entity87 , i hope that never happens with @entity3			1
there are those who were appalled by his @entity92 speech , in which he sneered at those who had ever doubted him			0
i thought it was great			2
he finally showed everyone who he really was			0
there has been far too much hagiography written about @entity3 , both in the past and now , far too much hero worship for a man who was , at his core , not an especially empathic person			1
that is not written pejoratively , for almost all the great athletes in any sport were singularly driven individuals who did n't play well with others			2
do you hear stories of @entity112 yukking it up in clubhouses with his opponents ? @entity116 : @entity3 's unofficial guide to @entity19 success @entity119 and @entity120 and @entity121 were each reviled by at least a few teammates for their brutal verbal takedowns of lesser players -- and almost everyone in their respective locker rooms were lesser players			1
@entity3 was merely the ultimate example of that ruthlessness , that desire to win that mutated into obsession			1
he finally won a title when he was surrounded by teammates who endured as much as they enjoyed , who could take his relentless prodding and testing and fight back , either verbally or on the court			0
make no mistake -- many of them made millions of dollars and became @entity92 credible playing next to him			0
@entity40 's @entity30 came to town , won the game , took over the fans , took your pride , took your girl , took everything that was n't nailed down			0
but it came with a price			0
but i liked that about @entity3			1
he was the best player i ever saw , the most determined , the toughest mentally , the most confident , the least insecure			1
his will was second to none			0
he took everyone on , and ultimately beat them			1
that is the @entity40 that is worth remembering , no matter what he winds up doing in @entity17 : young and handsome and dynamic and so willing to cut out your heart and show it to you			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity162 .			1
