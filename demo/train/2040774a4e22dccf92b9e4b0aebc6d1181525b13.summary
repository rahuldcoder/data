-- @entity1 has n't met a sensitive topic he could n't dig into , and now he 's speaking on what he calls a " dirty , dark secret " in the @entity7 - @entity6 community			1
during an interview with a @entity10 radio station , @entity1 expounded on claims that @entity13 quarterback @entity12 was n't liked by some of his teammates in part because he was n't considered to be " black enough			1
" @entity1 said he was n't at all surprised			2
" there are a lot of black people who are unintelligent , who do n't have success , " @entity1 said			1
" it 's best to knock a successful black person down ' cause they 're intelligent , they speak well , they do well in school , and they 're successful			2
it 's crabs in a barrel			2
... we 're the only ethnic group that says , ' hey , if you go to jail , it gives you street cred			0
' " the concept of " crabs in a barrel " is n't new , and it 's universal			2
if you 've ever seen a bucket of crabs at the market , the ones at the bottom will try to pull down the crabs that are closer to the top			0
" i lived this , and if it were n't for my parents i would n't have pushed through it , " one @entity48 user said in response to @entity1 's comments			1
education advocate and @entity0 contributor dr. @entity56 is another observer who agrees with @entity1			2
others have been irked by @entity1 's delivery			1
when @entity56 tweeted that he applauded @entity1 's remarks , some responded that they bristled at @entity1 's tendency to generalize the experience of an entire group			1
" unfortunately , as i tell my white friends , we as black people , we 're never going to be successful not because of you white people but because of other black people , " @entity1 said			2
" when you 're black , you have to deal with so much crap in your life from other black people			0
it 's a dirty , dark secret ; i 'm glad it 's coming out			1
" the controversy began with an item from @entity83 's @entity82 , who said some of @entity12 's @entity13 teammates do n't care for him because " they think he 's too close to the front office , " he " does n't always take the blame with teammates for mistakes he makes , " and " some of the black players think @entity12 is n't black enough			1
" " there is ... an element of race that needs to be discussed , " @entity82 said of @entity12 's relationship with his teammates			0
" my feeling on this -- and it 's backed up by several interviews with @entity13 players -- is that some of the black players think @entity12 is n't black enough			1
this is an issue that extends outside of football , into @entity7 - @entity6 society , though it 's gotten better recently			0
well - spoken blacks are seen by some other blacks as not completely black			0
some of this is at play			0
" ( @entity83 shares a parent company with @entity0			0
) the report has been denied by @entity13 player @entity110 , who said the accusations were " made up , " and @entity12 too has shaken off @entity82 's point of view			1
" black enough ? i do n't even know what that means , " @entity12 said			0
" i 'm just an educated , well - spoken male			0
" but to @entity1 , @entity82 's assertions are a very real part of being successful and black			1
" for some reason we 're brainwashed to think if you 're not a thug or an idiot , you 're not black enough			0
if you go to school , make good grades , speak intelligent and do n't break the law , you 're not a good black person , " he said			0
" it 's a dirty dark secret			1
i hate to bring white people into our crap , but as a black person , we all go through it when you 're successful			0
