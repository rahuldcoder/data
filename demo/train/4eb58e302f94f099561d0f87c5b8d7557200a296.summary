-- many of us find money in our couch			1
a few quarters here and a few dimes there			2
if we 're lucky , maybe enough to buy a drink			2
imagine finding enough to buy a small coffee stand			2
three @entity10 roommates , investigating the cause of their thrift - store couch 's lumpiness , discovered $ 41,000 hidden in envelopes tucked in the old sofa			1
@entity16 said she and roommate @entity17 were sitting on the couch , watching a @entity20 movie , when he unzipped one of the cushions to see what was making it uncomfortable and found a small package			1
" it was just in a bubble - wrap container , " @entity17 told " @entity28			2
" " we were like , ' oh , my @entity30			0
this might be drugs , it might be money ; we 're getting scared about it			1
" it was money , a stack of $ 100 bills an inch and a half high			1
the two started " freaking out " and went into a bedroom to show @entity43			0
her first impulse was to lock the doors in case it was drug money and the owner wanted it back			2
the roommates found more envelopes in the couch , which they had bought at the @entity51 for $ 20			1
one of the envelopes had a name on it			0
like many a wise man , @entity17 turned to his mother for advice			0
she investigated the name and texted her son a phone number to call			0
he said he hung up the first time when an older woman answered			0
he called back , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity62 , and told the woman he had " found something that i think is yours			0
" what is it ? she asked			0
" @entity30 , i left a lot of money in that couch , " the woman told @entity17			1
the woman told the roommates that family members had mistakenly donated the couch , where she had been stashing the loot			1
" this was her life savings , and she actually said something really beautiful like , ' this is my husband looking down on me , and this was supposed to happen , ' " @entity43 told @entity62			0
@entity16 said at first they played around with the idea of what to do with the money , but the thought of buying new stuff gave way to doing the right thing			2
" i think all of us were under the understanding that even if we spent it , we would n't feel good about it , " she told @entity0			1
" we would have felt we took something that was not ours			0
it did n't make sense -- it was her money , she deserved it			1
" according to @entity62 , the woman , who wants to remain anonymous , gave the roommates a reward of $ 1,000			1
they did n't rush out and get a new couch			1
after all , this one might smell , but it is pretty lucky			0
