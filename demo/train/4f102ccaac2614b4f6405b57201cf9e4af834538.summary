two gut - wrenching , frustrating , mysterious weeks			0
that 's how long it 's been since 227 passengers and 12 crew members boarded @entity5 , destined for @entity6			1
a routine trip , it seemed , to catch up relatives in time for the weekend , start on a work assignment or just get away			2
where they got to , still unknown			0
an exhaustive search -- covering a mind - boggling 2.97 million square miles , which is nearly the size of the continental @entity14 -- has yielded some clues , but no proof of where the @entity17 is or definitively what happened to it			1
the latest , most notable lead revolved around two large objects detected by satellite sunday floating on waters over 1,400 miles off of @entity25 's west coast			1
the first of several @entity25 military planes , as well as two long - range commercial jets , resumed their search saturday morning to find any trace of the objects , amid some skepticism that they or ships in the area ever will and , if they do , that whatever they find will be related to the missing aircraft			1
@entity25 prime minister @entity38 on friday defended the decision to announce the find , saying @entity25 owes it to families of those missing " to give them information as soon as it 's to hand			1
" but he did n't make any promises			0
" it could just be a container that has fallen off a ship , " @entity38 said during a visit to @entity50			0
" we just do n't know			0
" on friday , @entity55 , @entity56 's interim transportation minister , tried to reset expectations for a quick resolution to the mystery after the satellite discovery			1
" this is going to be a long haul , " he said			0
search intensifies after tough weather thursday , conditions improved friday to allow flight crews to look with their eyes rather than relying all on radar , said @entity69 , the @entity71 's emergency response manager			1
" that 's encouraging , " he said			2
" but we have no sightings yet			0
" the @entity75 was sending the @entity76 to aid a growing international flotilla searching the southern @entity78			1
@entity25 is sending a ship , the @entity80			1
and @entity56 and @entity82 vessels -- including the icebreaker @entity83 , or @entity85 , as reported by @entity82 's official @entity87 news agency -- are also steaming to join a massive @entity89 cargo ship diverted there thursday at @entity25 's request plus a motley collection of merchant ships heading to the search area			1
the window for finding the objects in the target area could be narrow			2
another round of bad weather like the one that hampered the initial day of searching thursday could rake the area , according to @entity0 meteorologists			0
locator beacons are also an issue			0
they are designed to sound for at least 16 more days and could continue to go off for a few more after that , according to the company that believes it made the device installed on the missing plane			0
but the ocean depths in the search area could make finding them very difficult , experts say			2
@entity14 defense secretary @entity114 -- who talked friday with @entity55 , who is also @entity56 's defense minister -- has ordered the @entity115 and policy experts to look at the availability and usefulness of @entity14 military undersea technology to try to find the plane 's wreckage and its data recorders , a @entity14 military official said			1
@entity55 has put out a call for underwater listening devices called hydrophones to aid the search			2
search continues elsewhere the @entity14 , which has had a p - 8 aircraft working out of @entity131 , @entity25 , and @entity115 ships involved in the search , has so far spent $ 2.5 million on the entire effort , @entity129 spokesman col. @entity128 said friday			1
@entity136 administrator @entity135 said friday that he 's tasked the @entity14 space agency to mine its existing satellite data and also try to capture fresh images that might aid in the search			1
its satellites can detect objects as small as 98 feet ( 30 meters )			2
countries from central @entity146 to @entity25 are also engaged in the search along an arc drawn by authorities based on satellite pings received from the plane for hours after it vanished			1
one arc tracks the southern @entity78 zone that 's the focus of current attention			1
the other tracks over parts of @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity82 and into @entity160			0
@entity55 said friday that @entity56 authorities were awaiting permission from @entity160 's government to use the country as a staging area for the northern corridor search			1
that clearly signals that @entity56 authorities are not giving up on the possibility the plane could still be found far from the focus of current search efforts			2
" obviously , the search now has taken a global perspective , " @entity55 said			2
more details emerge at friday 's daily news briefing , @entity176 ceo @entity175 said authorities knew of news reports that flight 370 's pilot , capt. @entity180 , placed a cell phone call shortly before his plane departed			1
he said they had passed the information to investigators			0
the significance of the call was unclear			0
as to other communications , @entity189 reported friday it had a transcript documenting 54 minutes of back - and - forth between the cockpit and ground control from taxiing in @entity194 to the final message of " all right , good night			1
" @entity0 has n't confirmed that this reported transcript it genuine , and @entity189 said @entity56 's prime minister said the transcript would n't be officially released			2
the alleged transcript reported by the @entity189 contains seemingly routine conversations about which runway to use and what altitude to fly at			0
one unexplained element , according to the @entity75 newspaper , is a call in which someone in the cockpit stated the aircraft was at a cruising altitude of 35,000 feet -- something that had been done just six minutes earlier			0
twelve minutes after that comes the " good night " message , at a point @entity5 was being transferred to @entity216 's control			2
another wrinkle : @entity175 acknowledged the plane was carrying a cargo of lithium - ion batteries , although he did n't specify the volume of the shipment			0
lithium - ion batteries are commonly used in laptops and cell phones and have been known to explode , although that occurs rarely			0
they were implicated in the fatal crash of a @entity229 cargo plane in @entity230 in 2010 , and lithium - ion batteries used to power components on @entity233 were blamed for fires in those planes			2
there 's no evidence the batteries played a role in the plane 's disappearance , and @entity175 said they are routine cargo aboard aircraft			2
" they are not declared dangerous goods " he said , adding that they were " some small batteries , not big batteries			0
" deleted files sought @entity56 authorities say they believe the missing plane was deliberately flown off course on its scheduled flight from @entity194 to @entity6			1
but they have n't so far found clear evidence to indicate who might have changed the plane 's path and why			2
the pilot and first officer have come under scrutiny , especially in light of information suggesting a sharp turn had been programmed into the plane 's flight management system before one of the pilots gave a routine sign - off to @entity56 air traffic controllers			1
plus , question marks remain over data authorities say was deleted from the hard drive of a flight simulator found at @entity180 's home			1
a @entity14 official familiar with the investigation told @entity0 on thursday that an @entity278 team is confident it can retrieve at least some of the deleted files			1
on friday , @entity14 law enforcement officials told @entity0 files were removed closer to the flight 's departure than was previously indicated			1
@entity56 's @entity55 had said items were deleted before february 3 , but @entity14 investigators now say such deletions happened after that date			1
law enforcement officials are n't drawing any conclusions about the subsequent deletions -- or the earlier ones -- just two days into reviewing the hard drive substantial contents			1
it is still not clear , for example , who erased the files , why they did and what was in them			2
investigators are also analyzing websites that @entity180 and the first officer , @entity300 , may have visited recently , the official said on the condition of anonymity			2
passengers also continue to be investigated			0
on friday , @entity55 said @entity304 told @entity56 that background checks on its citizens aboard the plane had come back clear			0
families frustrated the length of the search and the lack of concrete information has angered many family members			0
some have accused @entity56 officials of withholding details , or at the very least failing to update them			0
for the first time since the plane disappeared , @entity56 sent a high - level delegation to @entity6 to brief relatives who had opted not to travel to @entity56 to wait out the search			1
@entity55 said the 3Â½ - hour meeting went as well as could be expected , but , " although we answered most of the questions they raised , we could not answer them all , " he said			0
" the one question that they really want to know is the answer to which we do not have , " he said , " which is : ' where are their loved ones , and where is the airplane ? ' " passengers ' relatives in @entity194 were moved from the @entity338 to another , unspecified hotel because the @entity341 is booked for the upcoming @entity56 @entity343 race , said a hotel official who prefers to remain anonymous because she is not authorized to speak to the media			1
@entity346 , whose son was on board the plane , told @entity0 's @entity350 the wait for answers has been agonizing			0
" i do feel sad , it 's been 14 days , " he said			0
" i 'm still waiting for answers from the government			0
the sadness is still there , but i 'm just going to stay strong			0
" @entity346 's son , @entity358 , has attracted the attention of authorities because of his experience as a flight engineer			1
@entity346 said authorities have not contacted him and he is confident his son had nothing to do with the plane 's disappearance			0
what can we tell from fresh leads ? if this is the debris of @entity5 , what happens next ? the search for @entity5 : explore maps opinion : search for @entity5 highlights need for trust , unity in @entity146 @entity380 reported and wrote from @entity381			1
@entity382 reported and wrote from @entity383			0
@entity0 's @entity384 , @entity385 , @entity386 , @entity387 , @entity388 , @entity389 , @entity390 , @entity391 , @entity392 , @entity393 and @entity394 contributed to this report .			0
