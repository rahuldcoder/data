-- there was n't a cloud in the sky early friday when @entity4 trained his telescopes at the moon , hoping to catch a glimpse of a @entity9 rocket striking the lunar landscape			1
the moon , shown shortly before @entity9 's rockets hit on friday morning			1
" we saw nothing , " he said			2
@entity4 is vice president of the @entity16 near @entity17 , @entity18 , which had invited members of the public to watch friday 's @entity9 mission through its telescopes			1
the lunar strike happened shortly after 4:30 a.m. on the @entity24 ( 7:30 a.m. et )			1
@entity9 had encouraged everyone around the country to host " impact parties , " saying the plume of dust generated by the lunar impact would be visible through " mid-sized backyard " telescopes 10 inches or larger			1
it said the chances of seeing the plume were greater for people living in areas that were still dark			1
the space agency even posted an interactive map on its web site so people could find " a public event near you			1
" @entity9 officials had said the impact of the @entity46 upper - stage rocket would result in plumes of dust of more than 250 metric tons			1
after it hit , the debris was analyzed by a satellite -- launched along with the rocket -- that traveled through the dust cloud before its own impact on the moon			1
the goal of the $ 79 million mission was to determine whether there is water on the moon			1
after the impact , @entity9 officials called the mission a success , saying the satellite sent back a good amount of data that now will be analyzed			1
@entity66 of @entity67 , @entity68 , said she got up early to watch @entity9 's live telecast of the impact			1
she was disappointed , and posted her reaction on @entity0 's @entity72			2
" these was no plume , no nothing , " she said by phone			0
" it just kind of blacked out			0
" she said the telecast did not show the rocket 's impact clearly			0
" i was looking for some action -- something happening , " she said			0
" i think a lot of people were , because they [ @entity9 ] hyped it up , you know			1
... no one saw anything			0
" @entity66 woke up her husband and two children to see the lunar crash			1
she said she wishes she had n't			0
@entity91 , a high school science teacher near @entity92 , @entity93 , had planned to take some of his students to the nearby @entity95 to watch the lunar impact through their telescopes -- but they decided to skip the field trip because of bad weather			1
" this is truly a once - in - a - lifetime thing , " @entity91 had said beforehand			0
@entity91 -- who is also the director of the @entity101 of @entity92 -- said he had hoped the mission would influence his students to think about pursuing careers in science			0
" being as we do live here in @entity93 , we 're away from the hub [ of astronomy ] , " he explained			0
" we 're not in @entity109 , we 're not in @entity110 , we 're not in @entity111 -- it 's not something they 're used to seeing			0
" so any time you can show them something that 's never been done , and they say , ' oh this is pretty cool , ' i think they buy into that			0
" @entity9 held an all - night party at @entity124 -- located just outside @entity125 -- which was directing the mission			1
there were movies , music , food and guest speakers , and it culminated with a live transmission of the lunar impact			1
" i would have loved to see , you know , huge amounts of dust flying up and ejecta , but we did n't , " said @entity134 , who attended the @entity124 event			2
" i thought it was so neat being able to see just as we got closer and closer to the moon and realizing that that was really happening right now			2
" it was n't just a picture of the moon that somebody was putting up			2
" back at @entity16 , even though most of the 50 people who attended the " impact party " were disappointed , they were good sports about the " failure , " @entity4 said			2
even @entity4 , who has been an astronomer since he was 15 years old , said he got a lot out of the viewing party -- which he said was standing - room only			0
" i do n't look at the moon so much because it 's always there ... so i got to know the moon 's craters better , " he said			2
" and i think the people that attended , some of them that were disappointed , [ still ] felt like it was worth coming and being part of something that was going on			2
" he said he hopes the event generates more support for the observatory , which is run by volunteers			2
it is located in @entity172 , which is on a list of state parks that could close because of @entity18 's recent budget cuts			0
" we 're trying to promote interest in the peak and every single person that came was part of that , " he said			0
" they all learned something			0
" @entity16 has a 30 - inch telescope that @entity4 described as " the most accessible public telescope in the [ @entity125 ] @entity186			0
" he said he hoped that the reason they did n't see a plume from the rocket impact was n't because of " another case where somebody forgot to carry the one " -- a reference to incorrect mathematical computation , which was blamed for the failure of the @entity198 mission to @entity199 in 1999			0
he suggested that next time , @entity9 might want to be " a little more careful suggesting people should get out of bed at 4:30 in the morning and haul their kids out there			1
" @entity0 's @entity204 contributed to this report .			0

@entity9 crashes rockets into the moon on friday to test for lunar water
the space agency touts the event as an opportunity for amateur astronomers
*man*y say the event was a *dud* ; a wo*man* says she saw nothing on @entity222
*man* says @entity9 should be more careful before asking people to wake at 4:30 a.m.
