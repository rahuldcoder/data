-- the president of @entity2 announced new steps friday in the wake of a federal sexual harassment probe at the school , including creating an external committee of former graduates and facilitating informal chats between administrators and students			1
the school is accused of providing an insufficient process for addressing the federal gender - equity law , @entity17 , which may have resulted in " the denial of equal opportunity to education for numerous university students , " @entity14 @entity13 spokesman @entity12 has said			2
in an email friday , @entity2 president @entity22 said administrators and others at the @entity27 , @entity28 , university will cooperate with the federal education department 's @entity29			1
the university will take other immediate measures distinct from that investigation , the email said			0
they include the creation of an advisory committee , which has been charged with offering advice on how sexual harassment , violence or misconduct may be more effectively combated at @entity2 , " @entity22 said			1
" the committee will spend time listening to members of our community about the situation as they live it and will make its own assessments , " the president wrote , saying the group 's recommendations will be submitted to him next fall and eventually will be made public			2
the group will be chaired by @entity54 , the former chief justice of the @entity55			0
other members , including former @entity14 solicitor general @entity57 , the @entity58 's @entity61 @entity60 - crews and @entity62 , a @entity63 consultant			0
all were appointed by @entity22 , and all are @entity2 graduates			1
this move comes a week after @entity2 provost @entity66 announced that an internal committee -- consisting of student , faculty and administrative members -- would meet to build " upon the existing processes of the college and each of the schools , " and will address " allegations of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct of every kind			1
" that committee is to start up on july 1			0
" we believe that this streamlining will make it simpler for students and faculty to initiate and pursue any complaint , " @entity66 said in an email sent to @entity2 faculty and students			2
federal investigators are looking into a complaint that claims university policies allowed a " sexually hostile environment " to exist on campus , @entity66 has said			1
the complaint blames @entity2 for failing to adequately respond to alleged incidents of harassment , according to @entity12			2
the federal investigation follows a controversial @entity98 video released in october that apparently showed new recruits of the @entity101 fraternity repeating chants encouraging rape as they marched through campus			0
the board of directors of @entity101 issued a statement saying the international fraternity strongly condemns the actions of the @entity2 chapter and acknowledges that the sentiments expressed were offensive			0
the complaint also follows reports of a party in which undergraduate students were allegedly asked to strip naked			0
while @entity22 did not address any specific incident in his message , he did detail other actions -- in addition to setting up the second committee -- being taken before the school year ends in the coming weeks			0
that includes top administrators , including @entity66 and several deans , engaging students in the school 's dining halls for " a conversation about the campus climate and our policies governing sexual misconduct			1
" @entity22 said these informal meetings are taking place at his request , facilitated by members of the school 's women 's center			1
" the deepest values of our institution compel us to take very seriously the issues raised by the complaint , " @entity22 said .			0
