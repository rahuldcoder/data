-- the attorney for @entity2 's fired marching band director contends the university report that led to @entity6 ' firing was " deeply flawed			1
" @entity6 , a former assistant band director and former sousaphone player in the marching band in the 1990s , was fired last week after a university investigation concluded he " knew or reasonably should have known about sexual harassment that created a hostile environment			1
" " the report is deeply flawed			1
out of 225 band members , over an eight - week period , @entity2 managed to interview exactly four , including the person who made the complaint , and three people to whom she referred the university , " @entity6 attorney @entity13 said on monday			1
@entity19 added that of the thousands of local @entity2 alumni , the university interviewed just five during its two - month investigation			2
" with that sort of a skewed sample , the report does not accurately portray anything and can not be relied on for the facts			2
" the report , released last wednesday , described longtime traditions in the band like sexually explicit nicknames and something called the " midnight ramp , " in which band members entered the stadium through a ramp wearing only their underwear			2
the report alleged staff members , including @entity6 , were present for the annual event			2
@entity13 denied this allegation during an interview with @entity0 on monday			0
" they did not march on the field in their underwear			0
that 's something , even in that area , the report could n't get it right , " he said			0
@entity13 says the so - called " midnight ramp " was not a mandatory event but a " welcoming practice			0
" he described an e-mail he received from a former band member			1
" no one who did n't want to participate had to participate			0
if you did n't want to march in your underwear , you did n't have to , " the attorney said in detailing the e-mail			0
he went on to say the woman who sent him the e-mail " wore a tank top and gym shorts when she marched in it			0
" " i 've gotten e-mail after e-mail from former band members saying exactly the same thing , " @entity13 said			0
. an audio recording , purportedly of @entity6 yelling and cursing at a band member , surfaced on sunday			1
on the tape released by @entity2 , the fired band director is heard shouting at a member who contradicted him during practice			1
" you ever do that again after we 've given you a direct g * * * * * n order , and you 're done			0
do you understand ? " @entity13 conceded monday that @entity6 knew about some of the band 's bad behavior , but he said @entity6 did " everything he possibly could to end it			1
" " you know he experienced inappropriate behavior as a rookie band member himself			1
he was deeply affected by it and that 's why as band director he did everything he could to stop anything inappropriate , " the attorney said			1
but the university did n't think @entity6 did enough in the 21 months he led the marching band , first as interim director , then as band director			1
" nothing is more important than the safety of our students , " @entity2 president @entity94 said			2
" we expect every member of our community to live up to a common standard of decency and mutual respect and to adhere to university policies			0
" the university has appointed former @entity107 attorney general @entity106 to lead an independent task force to further investigate the situation and ensure steps are taken to change the band culture , @entity94 said			2
the @entity2 marching band is considered one of the best college marching bands in the country			1
the band calls itself " the best damn band in the land			0
" it shot to fame with an amazing halftime show tribute to @entity122 in 2013 that has garnered millions of @entity124 views			0
@entity0 's @entity125 and @entity126 contributed to this report .			0
