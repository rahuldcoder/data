-- with 1 billion tourists in 2012 , it 's little wonder the last 12 months have drummed up some juicy fodder for aviation reporters			0
@entity7 's @entity6 were a success -- the expected tourism boon not so much			0
" dark tourism " ( travel to sites of death , disaster or the macabre ) became a phrase			0
and various climatic events conspired to wreak havoc on travel plans across the world			0
but which were the stories that really stood out to those who are involved in the industry every day ? these are the top 10 : 10			0
@entity26 on its last legs " a new comprehensive plan will pave the way for a new , strong and competitive @entity26 , " read the statement from @entity26 last month			1
" the plan needs to be fully implemented and new collective agreements must be signed in a very short space of time in order for @entity26 to have access to necessary funding			1
" one of @entity38 's oldest airlines -- and one that still knows the meaning of passenger service -- is in dire straits			0
@entity26 faces aggressive competition from low cost carrier @entity44 , which has hundreds of aircraft on order from @entity48 and @entity49			1
the pioneer of polar flights , fully 40 percent of @entity26 's workforce is to be chopped			1
if the airline fails , and it 's been on the brink before , this will continue the trend in @entity38 toward consolidation that included the acquisition by @entity59 of struggling @entity60			1
not that this consolidation under the @entity63 ( @entity63 ) banner has gone well , either			0
iberia on the brink @entity63 's @entity60 will lose 4,500 jobs in a cost - cutting effort after losing € 262 million ( us $ 340 million ) through september			1
@entity63 characterizes @entity60 in a " fight for survival			1
" nearly 25 percent of its aircraft will exit the fleet and pay might be cut by 35 percent			0
there 's a january 31 , 2013 , deadline for labor to reach an agreement with @entity63 , which is negotiating to buy @entity79 's @entity78 , which is based in @entity80			0
@entity60 cuts jobs in survival bid 8			1
@entity83 loved by passengers , but continues to be a profit drag on @entity48 the @entity83 , a technological marvel and by all accounts a passenger delight , continues to be a thorn in the profit - and - loss statements of @entity48 and parent @entity91			1
discovery of wing rib bracket cracks in 2011 after the november 2010 high - profile engine failure on @entity96 required costly refits			0
never a safety - of - flight issue and affecting only a handful of the thousands of brackets on the @entity83 's wings , the retrofits and airline compensations cost @entity48 nearly € 300 million ( us $ 394.8 million )			1
airline schedules all over the globe were disrupted as fixes took aircraft out of service			0
the ad wars that broke out between @entity49 and @entity48 in late november -- 747 - 8 versus the @entity83 -- only add another dimension to the long - running rivalry			1
how do you pick up an @entity83 ? 7			0
@entity49 roars back with 737 max in 2011 , @entity48 stunned @entity49 by announcing orders and commitments for about 1,500 re-engined @entity116			1
this year , @entity49 came roaring back , expecting to finish with firm orders for around 1,000 re-engined 737 @entity113 aircraft			1
@entity49 still trails market share , and the @entity113 will enter service two years later than the @entity121			1
but any way you look at it , this was @entity49 's year			1
@entity49 unveils futuristic ' swallowtail ' wingtip for 737 max 6			2
@entity126 continues to become major force @entity126 and its ceo @entity128 are leading the low - cost carrier revolution in @entity130			0
taking a page from sir @entity134 's book with the @entity136 brand , @entity131 is leveraging the @entity126 name and logo to bring low - cost travel to hundreds of millions of people			0
@entity131 likes to point out @entity130 ( excluding @entity141 ) has a larger popular base than the @entity143 or @entity38 and that island and mountainous geography make flying the best ( and sometimes the only ) way to get around			2
@entity147 , the long - haul , low - cost operator , floated an initial public stock offering this year			0
@entity131 has major expansion plans in mind for this airline			0
a word of caution : @entity155 in @entity156 thinks @entity126 is expanding too rapidly , has too many aircraft on order and faces over-capacity in @entity160 from @entity161			0
@entity126 inks huge @entity48 deal 5			2
@entity49 dithers on @entity163 while @entity49 moved ahead with the 787 - 10 , it dithered on enhanced revisions to the highly profitable 777 - @entity165			1
when @entity167 was ceo of @entity168 , he wanted @entity169 to @entity170 ( @entity171 ) by the end of this year			0
@entity167 is gone , retiring unexpectedly			0
@entity171 for the @entity163 is put off for perhaps a year , say people familiar with @entity49 's current thinking			2
the @entity163 is @entity49 's answer to the @entity176 , which promises to be far more economical than the 777 - @entity165			1
but @entity49 figures it has more time because ... 4			2
@entity48 delays @entity176 the composite @entity176 was already some 18 months behind schedule when @entity48 announced a new delay this year for its planned entry - into - service ( @entity182 ) from mid-to - late 2014			1
many expect a further slip into 2015			0
first flight is still planned for mid- 2013 -- in time for the @entity186 in june ? but technical issues at @entity48 ' plant in @entity189 , @entity190 , will delay assembly for the test aircraft needed for certification , thus delaying @entity182			2
@entity48 ' challenges with the program prompt questions over whether the smallest family member , the @entity176 , will be canceled and whether the largest , the @entity176 - 1000 , is sufficient			1
@entity48 says the -800 wo n't and the -1000 is , but market doubts remain			2
first look at the @entity176 3			0
@entity49 launches 787 - 10 -- sort of the @entity203 's problems have become legendary in the industry and @entity49 wo n't make money on it for years			1
the @entity171 of the third member of the family , the high capacity , 6,800 nautical mile range 787 - 10 is a key bright spot			0
although official @entity171 did n't come in october as expected , a " soft " @entity171 did and @entity49 is talking with potential customers			2
a formal launch of this program is now said to be expected by mid- 2013			0
this sub-type should be a real winner for @entity49 and a profitable member of the 787 family			2
@entity141 expands aerospace role @entity141 's ambitions to become a major global aerospace player draws skepticism from many quarters			1
the @entity225 / @entity224 regional jet is essentially a @entity141 copy of the old @entity227 built in 1965			2
and it 's yet to enter service and is already five years behind schedule			0
many think the @entity232 will be similarly disappointing			0
but the @entity232 has 380 orders and commitments ( albeit entirely from @entity141 airlines and lessors ) even though it 's not expected to be up to @entity48 and @entity49 standards			1
the government wants the @entity232 to take half the home market , about 2,000 aircraft over 20 years , and this comes out of @entity48 ' and @entity49 's market share			1
but this is n't all			0
there are more than 20 @entity141 companies that want to play in the aircraft leasing field , though fewer than a dozen are active so far			2
many are affiliated with @entity141 banks , which are becoming bigger players in financing aircraft			2
anyone who thinks @entity141 wo n't be a major global player for aircraft , lessors and finance needs to think again			2
it 's just a matter of when , not if			0
it might take a generation , or even two , but @entity141 will become a viable , global aerospace presence			1
@entity141 leads the way to block @entity38 's @entity262 the @entity263 announced plans to implement its @entity262 ( @entity262 ) that requires airlines to buy and sell carbon credits			1
airlines and several countries , led by @entity141 , objected to this unilateral action , saying it should be a global accord reached through the international civic aviation organization trade group			1
@entity141 was the first to tell its airlines not to comply			1
but @entity141 uses aircraft orders from @entity48 and @entity49 as political leverage and refused to ratify an order for us $ 14 billion worth of @entity48 product			1
in november the @entity263 blinked and put off implementing @entity262			0
we 'll see if @entity48 lands the stalled orders by year end			2
nothing demonstrates the powerhouse clout @entity141 has on the global stage more than this			2
merger between @entity91 and @entity287 collapses barely in office after assuming the slot in mid- 2012 , @entity91 ceo @entity288 proposed a merger between @entity91 and @entity292 's @entity287			1
@entity293 leaked prematurely in september and under @entity292 takeover law , a decision to move forward or not had to be made the next month			0
the combination would have created a global defense behemoth rivaling the @entity49 it would have positioned @entity298 to bid more credibly on future @entity143 defense contracts			2
it would have balanced @entity91 ' over-reliance on subsidiary @entity48 for revenues and profits			1
it would have diversified @entity287 's sole reliance on defense , a shrinking market			2
it would have , at long last , diminished the government ownership ( and meddling ) of @entity308 and @entity309 in @entity91 and @entity48 affairs			1
the highly parochial @entity308 surprised everyone by going along			0
but @entity309 's government objected to losing sway over @entity48 jobs			0
@entity292 's government feared losing influence over @entity287 , a stock company , but which is one of @entity292 's major employers and a top defense contractor			0
@entity309 opposition killed the deal , and with it @entity324 ' dreams of @entity91 becoming a " real " public company free of government influence			0
@entity287 , eads $ 45 billion deal collapses what was the biggest aviation story for you ? let us know in the comments section below .			1
