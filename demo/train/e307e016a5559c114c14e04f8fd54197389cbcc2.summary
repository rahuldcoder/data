-- @entity2 , @entity3 , city officials have chosen a former @entity5 police chief as an interim replacement for the top cop who stepped aside during the furor over february 's killing of an unarmed teen			1
@entity12 , the former police chief in @entity13 , will take office in @entity2 at the end of the week , the city government announced tuesday			1
a news conference to introduce @entity12 is slated for friday			2
he will take over a department that has been under the microscope since the february 26 killing of 17 - year - old @entity21 by a neighborhood watch volunteer			1
@entity2 police chief @entity23 , who attempted to resign last week , will remain on paid administrative leave , according to a statement from city hall			1
@entity23 stepped aside as chief after a vote of no - confidence by city commissioners , but the commission voted against accepting his resignation while investigations into @entity21 's killing are pending			1
the case drew nationwide protests when police decided against arresting neighborhood watch volunteer @entity38 , who told investigators he killed @entity21 in self - defense			1
a special prosecutor assigned to look into @entity21 's death ultimately brought second - degree murder charges against 28 - year - old @entity38 , who has pleaded not guilty and been released on $ 150,000 bail			1
prosecutors asked for that bail to be increased after learning that contributors had donated more than $ 200,000 to a legal defense fund he set up			0
about $ 5,000 of that went toward the $ 15,000 cash @entity38 put up to post bond , defense lawyer @entity51 said last week			0
@entity38 has been in hiding since the case drew national attention , and he has solicited the money not only for legal fees but also for living expenses			0
@entity51 said the money has been put into a trust he controls , and his team announced tuesday that a former @entity64 agent has been hired as a third - party administrator to handle the funds			2
" the fund 's administrator will have sole discretion regarding the dispersal of funds , and guidelines will be put in place to define reasonable living expenses for mr. @entity38 and his family and to fund necessary legal expenses , " the defense team reported on its website			2
" neither mr. @entity38 nor @entity79 will have direct access to the funds			0
" donors ' names are not being disclosed			0
for the next three to five months , @entity12 " will be responsible for reviewing @entity85 's performance as it relates to the @entity21 case as well as provide overall leadership , " according to @entity13 police department spokeswoman @entity88			1
@entity12 , a 35 - year law enforcement veteran , began his career in the suburbs of @entity91 and @entity92 before becoming chief of the @entity94 , @entity95 , police department			1
after that , he took the reins of the @entity13 police department in 2007			1
@entity12 resigned that post in 2011 after @entity101 was elected as the city 's new mayor			1
it was widely reported that the new mayor forced @entity12 out , and a press release from @entity12 upon his retirement in october seemed to bear that out			2
" when mayor @entity101 was elected , i told him i was here to serve , and would do so loyally and do my best to lead the department in the direction he wanted to take the city , until such time that he felt he needed to bring in his own chief , " the release from @entity12 stated			1
" consequently , i have agreed to make room for this to happen by retiring from the @entity120			0
" attempts to contact @entity12 for this report were unsuccessful			2
a month ago , he was asked to consider the role of interim police chief in @entity2 , according to @entity88			1
she said she believes @entity12 is well - suited to what is bound to be a challenging , high - pressure assignment in @entity2			1
" chief @entity12 is a highly intelligent leader with a great law enforcement background who is skilled at analyzing problems and articulating sound recommendations for positive change , " she said			1
" he will bring a unique understanding and clarity to the situation -- as he has always done			0
we are excited to hear about his new role			0
" earlier this year , @entity12 served a three - month term as interim chief of police in @entity140 , a small community outside @entity13			1
" i 'm a big fan of @entity12			2
he really did a fabulous job here , " said @entity140 mayor @entity142			0
" he 's really going to be able to focus in on the existing situation and build a consensus on the right way to go			0
i think @entity12 will be uniquely qualified to find the commonalities in this community and rally them around a common thread			2
" @entity12 ' time in @entity13 ended with a controversy surrounding an undercover sting operation at a @entity156 restaurant			1
in june 2011 , a pair of undercover detectives and an underage informant entered a @entity156 restaurant to check to see if the employees there were properly checking for identification when serving alcohol			0
that @entity156 had previously been cited for serving minors			0
the restaurant refused to serve the underage informant but the detectives said they witnessed a waitress continue to serve a pair of intoxicated patrons			0
the detectives left and the restaurant and the waitress later were cited for serving intoxicated patrons			0
it later emerged that the detectives had ordered beer and drank at least part of the beer while at the restaurant , and surveillance camera footage of the patrons who were reported to be intoxicated was inconclusive			0
the charges against @entity156 and the waitress were dropped			0
chief @entity12 and the newly elected mayor , @entity101 , asked the @entity185 to launch an investigation			1
their report cleared the @entity189 of any wrongdoing , finding that the officers followed all appropriate procedures			0
the @entity193 and other media reported that @entity12 dismissed any notion that the @entity197 's controversy played a part in his retirement in a @entity201 post			2
" for those who have assumed that the controversy about a case at a local @entity197 's restaurant was responsible for my retirement , i can easily dismiss that one , " @entity12 reportedly wrote			2
" day in and day out , the @entity208 deals with so many sensitive issues , whether personnel related , crimes , public policy , fiscal ... this one does n't even register on the @entity214			0
" @entity0 's @entity215 in @entity216 contributed to this report			0

@entity13 veteran @entity12 steps in as @entity2 's interim chief
@entity12 , a 35 - year veteran , is expected to serve for three to five months
@entity2 chief @entity23 stays on administrative leave , the city says
@entity2 police have been under a microscope since the killing of @entity21
