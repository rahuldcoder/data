" @entity1 " heroine @entity0 inspired more than just a renewed interest in braided hairstyles			1
suddenly , in the immediate aftermath of the film 's $ 400 million - plus box office success ( in the @entity8 alone ) , archery landed in the bull 's - eye of pop culture			1
sure , we 've had the occasional " @entity15 " movies , which have achieved varying levels of success , and you could catch a glimpse of flying arrows in tv series like " @entity20 " and " @entity21 , " but archers have now taken center stage			1
( even the @entity24 had to spoof the phenomenon			2
) " @entity34 , " the @entity28 / @entity27 hit , is about a young woman who could wield a bow and arrow with the best of them			1
considering how long it takes to make an animated movie like " @entity34 , " that 's just a case of extraordinary timing			1
it was n't enough that the biggest blockbuster of 2012 , " @entity44 , " starred @entity41 , the @entity42 and friends			1
it also threw in an archer , @entity47			2
plus , if not for @entity49 and her sword ( maybe 2013 is fencing 's year ) , this season of " @entity21 " might belong to @entity52 , whose favorite zombie - slaying method is the crossbow			1
the top new series on tv ? that would be " revolution , " which includes -- you guessed it -- a heroine with a crossbow			2
post-apocalyptic tv is everywhere there 's more to come : @entity64 's return in the " @entity66 " video game will focus on archery , instead of a gun in each hand ; and the next two " @entity71 " films have the promise of archers bard the @entity74 and @entity75			1
@entity76 , the chief trend hunter at @entity77 , notes that " google search volume for archery has remained relatively constant " for archery over the years , but that 's not to say it has n't made a splash : he saw archery - infused fashion shoots crop up this year			1
however , he thinks a lot of it can be traced back to @entity86 and the character of @entity0			2
" there is an extra appeal that happens when you have one of the hottest pop cultural stars taking up any new sport , and in this case it happened to be archery			1
" " @entity96 " bucks hunter stereotypes it also does n't hurt that she got high marks from her trainer on the film			2
" she was very motivated and technically very good			0
i do think it looked good in the film			0
you can absolutely shoot apples from 80 to 100 yards out ( like @entity112 's character did ) , " @entity107 archer @entity106 told @entity108			0
so , how has pop culture affected archery as a sport ? @entity116 turned to one of the experts , @entity117 , spokeswoman for @entity119 ( including the @entity107 team ) and a level four archery coach			1
@entity116 : what level of interest have you seen in the sport this year ? @entity117 : we have had massive gains this past year			1
our membership has increased over 25 % this year			0
we typically do n't see gains like that			0
a lot of our membership transactions this year were new memberships			0
we 're seeing new people joining the sport			0
at our national championships this year , we had our largest number of competitors since 2001			0
in 2001 , we had roughly 370 adults and 150 - 200 kids			1
this year that number was completely reversed			0
our instructors have said they ca n't keep up with the demand			0
we think that 's fantastic			0
as archery films continue to come out , assuming we continue to see that popularity increase , we can provide opportunities to grow			1
@entity116 : is the portrayal of archery accurate ? @entity117 : i do n't think kids necessarily built a strong relationship with @entity154 's character in " @entity15 : @entity155			1
" when you have a heroine like @entity0 , it 's another story			0
the young people who heard the buzz about it connected with her			0
i saw it with women on a bow hunt : you had 60 - year - old women getting excited about that movie			1
" @entity34 " got the archery so technically correct			1
they got the flux of the arrow right			2
even a young archer will pick up on that			0
they made it look so beautiful			0
... @entity28 - @entity27 worked with us			2
we were able to arrange a screening with @entity107 hopefuls , olympians and their coaches screaming and cheering with this movie			0
they loved the fact that they got it right			0
@entity116 : do you think this level of interest can hold into the future ? @entity117 : looking in 2013 , we do n't have the @entity107 for two more years			2
what we have is this massive amount of interest from kids into the sport			1
friends will say , " hey this is really cool , come to archery with me			2
" we 'll continue seeing as the next three " @entity96 " installments ( come out ) over the next three years .			0

starting with the success of " @entity1 , " archery was big in 2012
pop culture seemed filled with bow and arrow - wielding heroes from " @entity34 " to " @entity206 "
archery is attracting more interest from kids and teens , according to @entity119
