-- @entity2 's response to the most dangerous security crisis @entity4 has faced in decades has been all speeches and symbolism with no actions of substance			1
on wednesday , president @entity9 hosted @entity10 , the new interim @entity11 prime minister , for lunch at the @entity13 , supposedly a thumb in the eye of @entity17 president @entity16 and a sign of @entity2 's commitment to @entity11 sovereignty			1
on thursday , secretary of state @entity21 announced that the @entity2 will take " very serious " steps if @entity17 does not back down by monday from its attempt to annex @entity24			1
but while the @entity13 was serving lunch and the @entity27 was issuing stern warnings , the president was also refusing to lift a finger to actually deter @entity16 's aggression			2
according to @entity31 , the @entity9 administration , " wary of inflaming tensions with @entity17 , " has refused to act on @entity11 's emergency request for military aid , including arms and ammunition , except to send military rations			1
officials in @entity38 estimate that @entity16 has amassed 80,000 @entity17 troops on the @entity11 border , and we are worried about " inflaming tensions " ? when will the administration put its might where its mouth is : when @entity38 is in flames ? or never ? as for @entity10 , whose visit symbolized our solidarity , well @entity9 hopes you had a nice dessert , because we 're not going to give your country the weapons it needs to defend itself			1
@entity55 is famous for a foreign policy he summarized as " speak softly and carry a big stick			0
" @entity9 's foreign policy is closer to " scream loudly and carry no stick			1
" it 's no wonder @entity16 has concluded that he 's unlikely to face serious consequences for his imperial adventure			0
the @entity2 did nothing when he invaded @entity64 in 2008			2
more recently , we did nothing after the @entity68 regime violated the " red line " @entity9 had established regarding the use of chemical weapons there			2
( @entity74 's offhand reference to inspections became the pretext a day later for backing off the pledge			0
) @entity16 does n't take the words of @entity9 or @entity21 seriously because their words are n't serious			1
the speeches are gestures -- much like the president 's wednesday luncheon -- and their relationship to action is nonexistent , as the administration 's refusal of @entity11 's aid request makes quite clear			1
the fact is anything short of providing arms and intelligence to the sovereign @entity11 government is unlikely to deter @entity16			2
clearly , we do not need @entity2 boots on the ground in @entity11 , a step we would both oppose			1
but if the @entity2 wants to stop @entity17 's dangerous incursion into @entity4 , we have to raise the cost			1
not just talk about potentially raising the cost at some point in the future once @entity17 has swallowed half of @entity11 and stationed tens of thousands of troops there			2
unless the president is willing to back up his words with military aid , he 's not serious about stopping @entity16 's armed aggression			1
in addition , the president should immediately issue an executive order approving the export of @entity2 natural gas to 20 countries that are awaiting bureaucratic approval			2
the highest priority should go to approving exports to @entity4 , where in many places , @entity17 has a near - monopoly on natural gas			0
furthermore , the president should issue an executive order approving 24 pending liquefied natural gas facilities that have been delayed by bureaucratic red tape			0
this would be a serious blow to the @entity17 economy that would impose a real cost on @entity16 's foray into @entity11			2
national emergencies justify actions that would not be taken in quiet times			0
a @entity17 invasion of @entity11 will create conditions that the president himself in his first executive order about sanctions called a national emergency			2
no one should doubt the seriousness of the events in @entity4			0
@entity17 is threatening to forcibly take over the territory of a sovereign state			0
taking over @entity24 , which was historically @entity17 and has a substantial @entity17 majority , has already been described by @entity9 and @entity21 as unacceptable and very dangerous			1
@entity17 occupation of the rest of @entity11 would be a vastly more threatening and more aggressive action			0
the situation calls for more than talk			0
if @entity16 discovers that once again the @entity151 will do nothing to stop his aggression , he might be reckless enough to test our resolve in @entity156 , @entity157 or @entity158 -- @entity160 members that we are bound to protect with military force			0
trouble there could " reset " us right back to direct warfare with @entity17			0
that would be a disaster and very , very dangerous			0
it 's past time for the @entity2 to help @entity11			1
indeed , passivity is the path most likely to lead to war			0
the @entity9 administration should grant the request for military aid immediately -- before it 's too late for deterrence			1

@entity181 , @entity182 : @entity2 has *protested* but has n't gone beyond symbolic measures
they say @entity9 's *meeting* with @entity11 leader and @entity21 's *condemnation* are n't *sufficient*
authors : @entity2 should have accepted @entity11 's emergency request for military aid
they say it is *crucial* to send a message that the @entity2 will respond *strongly* to aggression
