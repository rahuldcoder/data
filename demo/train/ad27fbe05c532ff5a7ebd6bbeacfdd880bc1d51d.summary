-- it would be hard to claim surprise at the array of sanctions which were finally imposed on the @entity6 regime in the last weeks , following months of seemingly endless warnings from friends and foes alike			1
yet , judging by the reaction of various officials in @entity13 , the regime does seem stunned by this shock to its system , having been living in denial about the evolving situation it created			0
from the apex of its fortunes only a couple of years ago to the most severe isolation modern @entity6 has ever witnessed , the regime of president @entity21 regime has single - handedly managed the feat which no other detractor achieved : bringing the entire country , and of course the regime itself , to a dead - end from which it can no longer extricate itself			1
while accustomed to @entity33 sanctions since 1979 , @entity6 had never been simultaneously cut off from @entity34 , @entity35 and the @entity37 world , while also facing the most determined popular uprising the @entity37 world has yet seen			2
for refusing to stop its mass military campaign of repression throughout the country , which none of the neighbors or friendly nations could continue to ignore while urging for the proverbial promised reforms , the @entity6 regime is now faced with a heavy bill it has no way of paying			2
taken separately , the various sets of sanctions could have been manageable , even if the hardships would still be passed on to the population under the usual empty slogans of sovereignty and resistance in the face of a global conspiracy			0
in response to the first set of @entity62 sanctions , in fact , foreign minister @entity57 had told a press gathering that @entity6 would " forget that @entity34 was on the map " and turn eastward for its business			2
when the sanctions reached the oil sector , the @entity6 regime boasted it would sell its crude to @entity69 , @entity70 and other " non-aligned " countries			1
however , with the increasing difficulties of dealing with a @entity75 under sanctions , even countries sympathetic to the @entity6 regime have been unwilling to go through so much trouble just to acquire @entity6 oil , which , to boot , is mostly a low - grade crude needing special refineries			1
with @entity34 wiped off the map , the 150,000 barrels per day output which used to be exported across the @entity84 will be difficult to sell , with very significant financial repercussions for the regime - and that was before the @entity88 finally decided to tighten the screws			1
it is possible that repeated warnings followed by recurring extensions of deadlines convinced the @entity6 regime that @entity37 countries were bluffing , and that the legendary impotence of the @entity88 would prevent real pressure from materializing ; this could explain @entity21 's bloody intransigence , and his erroneous interpretation that he really still had a carte blanche to kill , literally , the growing popular uprising which was now supplemented by armed resistance from an increasing number of defected soldiers , grouping themselves to form the @entity105			1
when the announcement of sanctions finally fell on november 12 , even with additional deadlines allowing the regime to accept a set of conditions ( including @entity37 monitors ) which could save it from isolation , @entity21 and his advisers seemed unprepared			0
instead of astutely accepting the offer to avoid greater seclusion , they decided to retreat into the usual conspiracy rhetoric while trying to buy time with complaints about protocols : this merely allowed the @entity88 to ensure near unanimity in its decision to isolate @entity21			0
all that remained was for @entity35 to close the loop , and to carry out its own promise to punish the @entity6 regime if it did not desist in what the @entity130 has since described as crimes against humanity			2
as of this week , the @entity6 regime is completely isolated , politically and financially			1
even the reluctance of @entity135 and @entity136 to apply full sanctions will be unlikely to make a big difference in @entity6 's fortunes , especially as international pressure continues to mount			2
the impact of this isolation can not be exaggerated			0
while powerful allies such as @entity144 and @entity145 will try , for the time being , to pull their weight as they attempt to save the regime from its own folly , perhaps lending it limited financial support , a solid geographical reality imposes itself , cutting off @entity6 from most of the rest of the world			1
there is no doubt that these measures will also hurt those who imposed them , and this is one of the reasons why they were so long in coming			0
for @entity35 , not only has the zero problem with neighbors policy been shattered , but the @entity37 world opening it had carefully nurtured will be negatively affected if transport trucks must now take a long diversion through @entity136			0
this will take time , effort and resources which had not been expected			0
the truth is that for all the propaganda spewed by the @entity6 regime , few countries in the region want to see @entity6 completely isolated , if only for their own selfish reasons			1
everyone is worried about potential civil strife and its effect on the region , but there is also an economic aspect : while losing trade with @entity6 might not make a difference to most neighbors , losing the trade route will			0
the battered @entity6 population will only feel more hardship as it struggles to overcome this unprecedented period in recent history , and the sanctions will affect people , economically , socially and politically			1
indeed , even @entity6 who do not actively support the revolution will feel the pain of remaining silent while the @entity21 regime entrenches itself with increasing violence , if that were possible			2
decades ago , the regime had been able to count on the population 's fear and on its acceptance of the broad argument of resistance in the face of imperialist aggression			0
today , however , the imposed agony of sanctions coupled with the extreme brutality of the regime will probably push people to make a stand before it 's too late			1
the sooner this happens , the less likely the possibility of civil strife or of intervention in @entity6			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219			0

@entity6 officials appear shocked by sanctions , despite endless warnings
the *ban* on oil sales will have significant financial repercussions
the regime is now isolated politically and economically
the sanctions , coupled with state brutality , could lead to *unrest*
