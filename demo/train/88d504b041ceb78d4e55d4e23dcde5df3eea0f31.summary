-- part of the imagined charms of space flight is not just the view from the window			1
it is also the thrill of breaking the shackles of gravity and free - floating			1
now taking a break from @entity13 's laws is easier ( and cheaper ) than ever			1
for years , the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) has used a @entity16 - owned @entity15 to run parabolic , aka " zero - gravity " flights for scientists and astronauts - in - training			1
last march , @entity16 started selling seats to the general public for a relatively reasonable $ 7,932			1
" i 've been doing this for 20 years , and every flight , there 's always this ' wow ' impression , " says @entity23 , the parabolic flight manager at the @entity14 , and a @entity26 record holder for most aircraft flown in parabola			1
" it 's like you get born again in a new environment			0
words are not enough to describe it			0
you have to live it			0
" " zero - gravity " is a bit of a misnomer , as the @entity41 -- the @entity42 that performs the missions -- never leaves @entity45 's orbit			1
rather , the weightless feeling is a result of the plane 's parabolic flight path			1
the aircraft shoots up at a 47 - degree angle at full engine thrust -- at which point everything inside the plane experiences hypergravity , and is heavier			1
the thrust is then reduced , and the plane is allowed to experience free fall , allowing everything inside to become weightless			2
" gravity does not disappear , but we are in a state of freefall , " explains @entity23			2
" with respect to the environment , which is the cabin , your weight will be zero			0
" magical though it may be , the experience lasts a mere 20 seconds			0
to draw out the experience , the @entity41 needs to thrust up and fall down in a series of 30 parabolas ( it 's no wonder it 's nicknamed the " vomit comet			0
" ) the @entity41 has not abandoned its main purpose , however , which is to provide a handy gravity - free environment for scientists to conduct experiments			1
" it is a beautiful opportunity , " notes @entity80 , a professor at @entity82 's @entity81 who is researching gravity 's effect on upper - body movement			1
" by studying the manipulation of objects in different gravity fields , we understand how important gravity is on @entity45 , " he explains			2
" we are gravity dependent			2
" sticking a scientist on a parabolic flight is considerably cheaper than sending them to the @entity96 , and many of the world 's top space centers use @entity41 as a venue for the early stages of experimentation			1
it 's no surprise that a lot of the research is space - themed			2
the @entity107 in @entity108 , for instance , is researching how gravity affects our everyday perception of objects in terms of weight and density			2
according to @entity116 , a researcher at the university , studies show that on @entity45 , when people are presented with two balls of equal weight , they will mistakenly assume the smaller one is heavier			0
this is known as size - mass illusion			2
read more : @entity124 explores the @entity125 " in microgravity , we do n't have weight , just mass. it gives us the opportunity to see what the mechanism is underlying this illusion , " says @entity116			0
in terms of real - world application , the experiment can help prevent accidents in space			0
" we do n't want astronauts to take different objects and smash them , " he says			0
according to @entity23 , allowing the public to board the plane is partly an educational enterprise			0
by interacting with scientists , they 're able to better grasp the affects of microgravity			0
" it allows them to have an experience of zero gravity , and to see what it 's good for , " he says .			0

last march , @entity16 started selling seats on their " zero - gravity " flights .
planes that follow a parabolic flight path can mimic the feeling of entering a gravity - free zone .
tickets cost $ 7,932 ( cheaper than $ *250,000* for a seat on @entity167 ) .
the flights are *popular* with scientists and astronauts - in - training .
