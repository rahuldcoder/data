-- @entity2 team principal @entity1 has defended the @entity5 constructor 's decision to retain the services of @entity8 driver @entity7 for the 2013 season			1
@entity7 's future was the subject of much speculation after he failed to score a point in the first three races of 2012 and went on to collect just 25 points prior to the sport 's annual midseason break at the end of july			2
but @entity7 , who has been with @entity2 since 2006 , recovered in the second half of the campaign to score 98 points and record two podium finishes , ending the year seventh in the drivers ' championship			1
@entity1 is convinced @entity7 has turned the corner , showing the form he displayed before fracturing his skull when a spring struck his helmet at the @entity30			1
" i think the toughest part of @entity7 's career is now behind him , " @entity1 told @entity2 's official website , when asked about the 31 - year - old			1
" after last summer his approach turned about and , as a result , his performance on track changed and he managed to show just how talented he is			0
" i 'm sure his problem was not linked to his contractual situation			0
personally , there was a lot of pressure on me regarding possible changes , but in the interests of the team , i preferred to wait and today , i 'm convinced that keeping @entity7 in the @entity2 family was the right decision			1
" @entity7 signed a new one - year deal with the most successful team in @entity53 history in october , although he admits he did consider turning his back on the sport when he was struggling for pace			1
" i thought about so many things , " @entity7 , who lost out on the 2008 world championship on the final corner of the final race , told @entity60			2
" i thought maybe i was finished			0
i thought about not staying in @entity2			0
i did not know what would happen			0
so many things were inside my brain			0
" many people said i was just using fuel at the beginning of the year and then after they want me to stay in @entity2 because it was the best option			2
it is important to work to get the good result			0
if you have that nothing else is important			0
" @entity7 and teammate @entity73 , who lost out on the 2012 drivers ' title to @entity77 's @entity76 on the final day of the season , will be hoping to make a strong start to the 2013 campaign when the season begins in @entity82 in march .			1
