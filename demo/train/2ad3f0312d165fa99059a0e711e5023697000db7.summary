@entity1 's parliament sunday called for an end to drone strikes on its territory after a @entity6 missile attack mistakenly struck a wedding convoy , killing more than a dozen people			1
the nearly unanimous but non-binding vote was " a strong warning " to both the @entity6 and the government of @entity1 president @entity12 , a @entity1 government official told @entity14			1
" the @entity1 public is angered by the drone strikes , " said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he 's not authorized to talk to reporters			1
" the people 's representatives reflected on the tone of the streets			0
" that anger was further stoked last week after what @entity1 security officials said was a @entity6 attack in southwestern @entity1 last week			1
intelligence reports had identified the targeted convoy as carrying @entity31 militants , but the passengers were actually members of a wedding party , the officials said			2
the officials said that 14 people were killed and 22 others wounded , nine critically			0
@entity6 officials declined to comment on the report			0
the attacks are part of a joint @entity6 - @entity1 campaign against @entity31 , and @entity1 's government is unlikely to approve any measure that would limit the use of unmanned aircraft , the government official said			1
" @entity1 's air force and troops ca n't carry out missions in remote areas			2
drones have had success in targeting small number of militants , " the official said			0
the highest - profile target of that campaign was @entity57 , the @entity6 - born @entity58 scholar and cleric who acted as a spokesman for the @entity1 - based branch of @entity31			2
@entity62 was killed in a drone strike in september 2011			0
but the @entity6 - based @entity64 reported in october that at least 57 civilians had also been killed by missiles fired from the unmanned aircraft			0
and some @entity1 security experts argue that drone strikes have aided @entity31 by turning peaceful tribal communities into vengeful killers			1
drones also have been used extensively against @entity31 and @entity74 fighters in @entity75			0
lawmakers there have objected strenuously to the attacks , but former president @entity79 acknowledged in april that his government secretly signed off on some strikes inside his country .			2
