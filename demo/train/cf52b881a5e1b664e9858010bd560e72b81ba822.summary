@entity0 -- the @entity2 conducted an electronic systems test saturday in preparation for @entity6 's highly anticipated initial public offering			1
only a small number of people were on the trading floor for the test , which @entity2 spokesman @entity11 called successful			1
the exchange tested connectivity and running data and did a simulated auction			0
" we 're grateful to all the firms that chose to participate			0
we are being very methodical in our planning for @entity6 's ipo , and are working together with the industry to ensure a world class experience for @entity6 , retail investors and all market participants			2
" the date of the ipo has n't been announced			0
in a regulatory filing earlier this month , @entity6 set a preliminary price range of $ 17 to $ 20 per share for its ipo , though that price could change			0
@entity6 will have to set its final price the night before it begins trading			0
the ipo price , however , is really meant for institutional investors such as @entity33 and @entity34 , which can purchase shares directly from the @entity37 's underwriters			0
regular investors will get their first chance to buy @entity6 the following day , when shares will begin trading on the @entity2 under the ticker " @entity6			1
" @entity6 's choice to go with @entity2 was considered a snub to the tech - heavy @entity45 exchange , which caught major heat for the massive fumbling of @entity49 's ipo last year			1
@entity49 was the most anticipated ipo of 2012 and one of the largest ever for a tech company , but an array of problems and misjudgments led to a botched ipo in may , and the company 's stock plummeted			1
the initial offer price of $ 38 was too high , too many shares were issued , its opening day was marred by @entity45 's technical glitches and underwriter @entity34 was fined for improperly influencing share sales			2
@entity49 's stock has since recovered and is now trading above $ 50 , helped in large part by its swift success in selling ads on mobile devices .			2

@entity2 *wanted* to avoid a repeat of @entity45 's @entity49 bungle
only a *handful* of people were on the trading floor
the @entity2 says the test was a success
@entity6 is preparing for a highly anticipated ipo
