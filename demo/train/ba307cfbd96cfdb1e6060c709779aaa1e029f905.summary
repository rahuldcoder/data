-- " hey , @entity1 ! " there was a time in @entity4 life that if you shouted those words on a busy street , or on a factory floor , you might see dozens of people turning expectantly toward you			1
for much of @entity4 history , @entity11 was one of the top 10 names that families gave to their newborn sons			1
today , @entity1 no longer even makes the top 20			1
@entity4 is ever - changing , in any number of ways , and one of the most fascinating of them can be found in the names mothers and fathers give to their sons and daughters			1
the @entity27 , in addition to sending checks to older @entity4 , keeps track of the names of the youngest @entity4 : newborns			1
the agency does this for bookkeeping purposes : the babies will someday , during their working lives , be a source of revenue for the @entity27 , and later ( assuming @entity27 survives ) will be recipients of retirement income			1
in the meantime , by compiling the names and their ranking in popularity ( the list goes back to the birth year 1880 ) , the agency paints a perpetually in motion portrait of what we are called			1

this is probably a good thing -- it is an affirmation of the vitality of a nation moving always into the future			2
yet some of the particulars would undoubtedly startle just about every @entity65			1
whose three names , as emblemized by that time - honored phrase , were , for much of the 20th century , on the tip of @entity4 's tongue			1
but , according to the @entity27 's most recent compilations , @entity71 no longer makes the top 50 names for newborns			1
@entity76 ( formally , @entity75 ) has dropped out of the @entity77			1
@entity78 comes in all the way down at no. 709			0
the evolution in names has been building in strength for quite a while ; it kicked into high gear in the 1970s , ' 80s and ' 90s when , according to @entity27 records , @entity80 and @entity81 , brittanys and @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 and @entity86 and @entity87 began to join and supplant the names that had for generations dominated the all - but - static lists			1
and by now the iconic names of the seemingly not - so - distant past appear destined to be iconic no more			2
@entity100 ? @entity100 of @entity101 , @entity100 of @entity102 , @entity100 of @entity103 ? @entity100 of @entity105 ( who was born in 1963 , when @entity100 was the no. 2-most popular name ) ? @entity100 has fallen out of the top 25			0
maybe @entity107 will help him come back			0
@entity110 , @entity109 , goodnight , @entity111 ? @entity109 , once a no. 1 champion , misses the top 15 ; @entity114 is not listed in the top 1,000			0
@entity115 ( formally , @entity116 ) was a longtime ( 1924 to 1939 ) no. 1 , but today he fails to crack the top 50			0
in the words of a great mid- ' 60s song by the @entity123 , he 's " @entity124			0
" read more : does your name shape your destiny ? ( @entity130 are the first names of @entity132 and @entity123 themselves , as far as current popularity goes			2
@entity128 comes in at no. 376 ; @entity134 -- or @entity135 , with the extra " l " -- is at no. 406 and / or 378			2
) so if those once - standard names have vanished from the top 10 , who , according to the @entity27 , are some of the guys who have replaced them in today 's top 10 ? say hello to @entity141			1
@entity145 to make your acquaintance , @entity148			0
and the change is even more dramatic for girls			0
@entity151 , the most popular female name ever , including an uninterrupted 66 - year streak at no. 1 , from 1880 through 1946 ? @entity151 has dropped down to no. 112			1
the pattern holds for many of the other female names that were , in the middle of the 20th century , utterly commonplace			2
@entity158 is at no. 541 today			2
@entity159 is at no. 808			0
@entity160 is at no. 667			0
@entity161 is at no. 764			0
@entity162 ( as in @entity163 ) is at no. 614			0
and then there 's @entity166			0
in the late 1950s she was no. 5 , as @entity4 danced to " i had a girl , @entity166 was her name " and watched " the @entity171 " on television			2
today @entity166 has fallen all the way out of the top 1,000			0
to be replaced in the current top 10 by , among others , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180			0
read more : parents name child after @entity184 ' like ' button what accounts for the changes in names and tastes ? there are probably as many individual reasons as there are names themselves -- everything from shifts in ethnic patterns , to actors , actresses , athletes and singers who inspire new parents mulling over names , to people simply becoming tired of the sound of the old litany of names			1
giving a child a name is perhaps the most personal decision a mother and father ever make			0
it is an act of absolute freedom			0
the government ca n't tell you what to name your child , your employers or extended family ca n't force your hand -- coming up with a name is a parent 's first and biggest choice			2
one to be celebrated -- as is the country 's constant impulse to evolve and start anew			0
there 's no logical reason to long for the days of @entity100 , of @entity158 and @entity1			1
that train has left the station			0
guided by its pair of trusty engineers , @entity234 and @entity235			2
currently the no. 1 names for the youngest members of the @entity4 family			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity241 .			2

@entity241 : the @entity27 keeps track of evolving baby naming trends
he says for decades , " standard " @entity4 names held sway -- your @entity65 , @entity76 , @entity158 . not now
even names like @entity1 have moved way down the list . starting in the ' 70s , names *transformed*
@entity241 : ethnic , cultural shifts probably reason . now : @entity1 ? say hi to @entity143 . @entity151 ? @entity235
