imagine putting wings on the @entity2 and getting it to fly around the world			1
that 's basically @entity7 in a nutshell			1
now the @entity9 has announced the next generation of this world - class icon will be a military version of the 747 - 8			1
for nearly 30 years , the current jumbo jet @entity7 has been a customized version of the 747 - @entity16			1
the newer 747 - 8 is longer and more efficient than its older brother			2
why is a new one necessary ? " it is time to upgrade , " air force secretary @entity19 said in a statement wednesday			0
the difference between the civilian version and what the president will fly on : the commander in chief gets a plane that 's tricked out with top - of - the - line parts and backup systems			1
and a lot of technology that 's -- well -- classified			0
related : what 's new about the 747 - 8 ? let 's remind ourselves why the world is so fascinated with this flying technological marvel			2
for more than half a century , passengers aboard the @entity39 presidential aircraft have been witness to @entity39 history			1
consider the fact that all these things happened on an air force one : -- president @entity46 's body was flown to @entity47 for burial			0
-- @entity49 was sworn in as president			0
-- @entity49 let a reporter interview him in the plane 's stateroom , while dressed only in a towel			2
-- the only woman ever to swear - in a @entity39 president did so aboard @entity7			1
-- president @entity57 became the first @entity39 president to visit @entity59 , where he historically opened the door to @entity39 - @entity59 relations			1
-- @entity7 served as president @entity63 's command center during the first hours following the 9/11 attacks			1
one of the main goals for the new plane , the @entity7 said , will be affordability			1
although the plane is designed to be more fuel efficient than its predecessor a new 747 - 8 lists for around $ 368 million			2
add all the presidential bells and whistles and the sticker price goes north rather quickly			0
the 747 - 8 is made in the @entity39 , which the @entity74 hinted was a plus			1
" the @entity77 is the only aircraft manufactured in the @entity39 ( that ) , when fully missionized , meets the necessary capabilities , " wednesday 's statement said			1
the four - engine @entity79 -- the world 's largest airliner -- which is made in @entity83 , was thought by some to be @entity85 's only competition for @entity7			1
when will the president get a new jumbo jet ? hard to say			0
if everything goes smoothly , @entity85 likely will work with the @entity7 on hammering out a timeframe and production schedule			1
in december , @entity85 had 36 unfilled orders for 24 passenger versions and 12 freighter models			0
from humble beginnings as a small , less than impressively outfitted plane during the @entity97 administration , to its current jumbo jet status , @entity7 has become a world - class icon representing power and privilege			1
members of @entity103 , celebrities and advocates clamor for seats on it , to get rare access to the president -- arguably the most powerful person on the planet			0
the plane 's well - known blue and white color scheme was largely created by legendary industrial designer @entity113 and approved by @entity46 himself			2
officially , the aircraft is only called @entity7 while a sitting president is aboard			1
the presidential fleet includes several aircraft , other than the two 747s , that from time to time carry the " @entity7 " call sign			1
the presidential helicopter is operated by the @entity121 and is often seen ferrying the president to and from the @entity123 of the @entity2			1
it 's called " @entity125			0
" on the rare occasion the president travels by @entity129 aircraft , that is known as " @entity130			0
" by the same logic , aircraft used to carry the vice president are given the call sign " air force two			0
" over the years , the various " @entity140 " have had their fair share of @entity139 screen roles			0
for example , the technological wizardry onboard the present 747s got wide play in the 1997 @entity146 action movie " @entity7 , " in which the president 's jet is hijacked by @entity150 nationalists			2
however , many of the more outlandish gizmos featured in the film owed more to , shall we say , artistic license than to airborne fact			0
the plane for example has no escape pod			2
nor is it equipped with parachutes -- the massive slipstream created by an aircraft the size of a 747 means they ca n't be used			0
designed to operate as independently as possible from ground services , the aircraft can fly halfway around the world without refueling			2
they carry their own automated baggage loaders as well as built - in front and aft stairs enabling them to operate self - sufficiently at airports and airfields around the world , minimizing security risks			2
capable of in - flight refueling from airborne tankers , manufacturers say the aircraft has " virtually unlimited range " -- its passengers sustained by galleys capable of storing up to 2,000 meals at a time			0
the entire aircraft is shielded against the effects of electromagnetic pulse -- a wave of energy generated by the detonation of a nuclear device that can disable unprotected electronics			0
it features private accommodation , office space and a workout room for the president , first lady and family ; as well as accommodation and offices for support staff and security personnel			0
also on board is a stateroom and conference rooms that can , should it ever be necessary , be converted into a fully functional airborne medical center			0
@entity0 's @entity210 contributed to this report .			0

@entity9 approves bigger version of the @entity77 as the new @entity7
@entity7 may be the most famous plane in the world
basically a @entity2 with wings , it has been witness to @entity39 history
