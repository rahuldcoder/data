an image of 48 - year - old @entity2 in lingerie is stirring discussion about what " real " women look like -- but not for reasons you might expect			1
the practice of photo retouching in fashion publications renders most models completely free of blemishes or imperfections to the point of being unrealistic			1
but this photo of @entity17 baring her sun - kissed torso is drawing praise for showing her in a realistic light			1
the image comes from a cover shoot for the december 2013 issue of @entity26 and @entity30 , representatives for the @entity26 - based publication said			1
the photo in question was not published , and spokespeople did not provide an explanation for how it surfaced last week			1
sex , lies and media " during the session that we did at that time for our edition , we proved that @entity2 is an ambassador of beauty who has made history			1
it was a total privilege to have this fashion icon on the cover , " @entity43 , editor in chief of @entity26 and @entity30 , said in a news release			1
" the most important thing about this news is to note the beauty that @entity17 has always been , and how happy we are that she has been part of a production for @entity26 and @entity30 -- a title that shows the strength and power of real women , always respecting ( their ) beauty , individuality and femininity			1
" opinion : is @entity2 's photo empowering ? the image spread through social media on friday after @entity66 @entity65 anchor @entity64 shared it on @entity68 , attributing it to @entity70			1
@entity64 said she first spotted the image on a friend 's private @entity73 feed and sought it out on @entity68			2
she said she found it on a fashion blog whose name she could n't recall , and she shared the image from there			2
regardless of the photo 's origins , @entity64 said , she took comfort in the image as a celebrity whose looks are constantly scrutinized			1
" women come in all sorts of different shapes and sizes , " @entity64 said			0
" i think it 's important to see all sorts of body shapes on our screens and in our magazines so that people have a true reflection of what people look like			0
" fat is the new ugly on the playground the @entity103 version of @entity70 , a joint venture between @entity105 and @entity107 - based @entity106 , called the image real , honest and gorgeous but denied any connection to the photo			2
" it appears that this unretouched version is a leak , " the magazine said in an online post friday			0
" no matter where the photo came from , it 's an enlightenment -- we 've always known @entity17 was beautiful , but seeing her like this only makes us love her more			2
" report : kids as young as 5 concerned about body image the image is still resonating days later			0
actress @entity125 was one of many to applaud the image on @entity68 by sharing an image of herself in skivvies			0
" @entity17 , " she said			0
" beauty is truth , truth beauty , that is all @entity133 need to know on earth , and all @entity133 need to know			2
" others , however , questioned the reflex to applaud realistic depictions of women in fashion			0
the response has not been entirely positive			0
but @entity64 said it matters not what detractors say			0
" i want people to feel like magazines are n't responsible for their happiness when it comes to their bodies but magazines also have a responsibility to show us an array of images , " she said			0
bottom line ? " no one has the right to tell other people how to feel about their body			0
" age before beauty ? we 've got both , actually			2
