-- their @entity2 owners once talked about pushing @entity4 into the elite tier of the @entity6 but just 18 months after their takeover , poultry giants @entity7 's are contemplating relegation			1
monday 's 1 - 0 home defeat to @entity12 condemned the former @entity6 champions to the second tier amid angry scenes at their @entity17 home			1
the club 's @entity19 manager @entity18 , who has been subjected to abuse by supporters all season , had to be escorted from the pitch by police as a group of fans invaded the playing surface			1
after the game @entity18 insisted he was the man to restore @entity4 's status , telling the match broadcaster : " we 're absolutely devastated			1
the players are numb inside the dressing room			0
" we felt as though we 'd done a very good job tonight			0
it 's a massive setback but we 'll be back to fight another day			0
" what we have to do is regroup			0
we have to add some established players and we have to look to keep as many of the players together as possible			0
" @entity4 ' relegation marked a stark contrast to the bright optimism that greeted their takeover back in november 2010 by @entity7 's , the first @entity2 owners of a @entity6 club			1
back then , they talked of finishing in the top four in the division , and linked themselves with high - profile players like @entity53 's @entity52 - winning attacker @entity51			0
but after modest spending and a turbulent season , which also saw their manager banned for drink driving , a late goal from @entity12 's @entity61 defender @entity60 sealed their fate			2
upon the final whistle , a group of fans took to the pitch as @entity18 was bundled off the field by security staff and a handful of police			0
others in the stands chanted : " we want @entity7 's out			1
" @entity4 won their only @entity6 title in 1995 but have failed to challenge since			2
they were relegated in 1999 but bounced back under former @entity76 midfielder @entity75 two years later			0
as for @entity12 , victory secured their @entity6 status and confounded a legion of critics who had written them off as doomed after they lost eight matches in a row at the start of the season			1
but a recent run of six wins in eight games , which has seen them beat @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity76 and @entity91 , has cemented their place in the top flight for another year			2
meanwhile in @entity95 , @entity94 reclaimed their position at the top of the @entity99 from big - spending @entity100 after a 2 - 0 victory at @entity103			1
a strike from @entity106 striker @entity105 was added to by an own goal from @entity108 , as @entity94 moved three points clear of @entity100 with two games remaining			0
@entity111 kept up their faint hopes of retaining their crown with a 3 - 0 win over @entity115			2
@entity116 's double ensured they ended the evening five points behind @entity94 and two behind @entity100			0
@entity120 , 2009 champions , won 4 - 2 at @entity121 , helped by two goals from @entity123 while @entity125 's goal secured a 1 - 0 win for @entity127 at home to @entity129 .			1

@entity4 are relegated from the @entity6
*rovers* lose 1 - 0 at home to @entity12 , who secured their top flight status
the match was *dominated* by *protests* by @entity4 's fans against club 's owners
many blame @entity2 firm @entity7 's and manager @entity18 for their relegation
