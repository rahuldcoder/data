a week before @entity2 is expected to finally hear from @entity4 contractors on the ground in @entity6 during the deadly @entity8 attacks , a @entity1 member said it is long overdue the @entity10 public learn the truth of " the murky events of september 11 , 2012 , " that left a @entity10 ambassador and three other @entity10 dead			1
" we know what the senior people have said but we do n't know what the people who were on the ground are going to say and we need to get those answers , " rep. @entity14 ( @entity15 ) told @entity16 by phone wednesday			0
in a letter to house speaker @entity25 sent wednesday , @entity14 said if questions remain unanswered or " if some answers differ substantially from the established narrative and timeline of the attack , then it would be warranted to take new measures to complete the investigation and synthesize the information obtained by the @entity30 and other committees investigating the @entity8 attack			1
" @entity14 suggested if that occurs , @entity2 should consider appointing an independent investigator			0
@entity6 lawmakers , top officials discuss @entity8 violence separately , another @entity1 , rep. @entity43 of @entity44 , has called for a special select committee to investigate @entity8			1
while most of the @entity48 leadership has ignored @entity43 's call , 178 fellow republicans have signed his petition for the special committee			0
not one @entity52 has signed			0
@entity14 sits on the powerful @entity53 which , as @entity16 first reported , next week is expecting the behind closed - door testimony of three @entity4 contractors who worked for the intelligence agency when ambassador @entity58 and the three others were killed			1
to date , the only @entity4 operative on the ground during the attack to testify before the committee has been the no. 2 @entity4 manager in @entity6			2
the lack of direct testimony from those on the ground has frustrated a number of congress members who have told @entity16 they are tired of the @entity8 affair being filtered through the memos prepared by staff and testimony of others who were not in @entity6 , or were there but have not had the opportunity to give firsthand accounts to elected members			1
@entity14 outlined the questions he hopes the committee will finally get answers to from witnesses			0
those questions range from why a special @entity84 - led counterterrorism team was not dispatched as the assault was ongoing to whether the terrorists responsible have been identified but administration officials have failed to authorize a capture / kill operation			1
' " we need to identify who -- at the level of presidential cabinet secretaries or at the @entity94 ( @entity95 ) -- signed off on the decision not to dispatch a fest team to @entity8 and determine the basis of that decision , '' @entity14 wrote			1
@entity97 stands for @entity100 , interagency response teams sent to provide assistance to ambassadors			0
while @entity14 writes that it is unlikely the ambassador could have been saved , " the team could have advised , assisted , and coordinated security at the compound and the annex after the attack			2
" he also wrote it could have aided in the hunt for the perpetrators , noting that the @entity114 did not reach the area until three weeks after the assault			0
letter raises a series of questions the @entity14 letter also asserts there still is information lacking or discrepancies on other fronts , including : -- communications during the attack between the @entity8 annex , the @entity84 compound where the ambassador and his aide and computer security expert @entity131 were killed and with other @entity10 based agencies ; @entity14 specifically wants to know whether there was chatter on a classified channel to which no committee would have access			1
-- which terrorist groups had the sophistication to secure the coordinates for the deadly mortar hits on the @entity4 annex , one of which killed former @entity146 @entity145 and @entity147			0
-- the need for a full accounting of purchases made in @entity8 " by the @entity84 and other government agencies in the year prior to the attack			1
" while @entity14 would not elaborate , it has been widely debated on whether the @entity10 was involved in a gun - buying mission to be sent to @entity156 rebels			2
a senior intelligence official last week told @entity16 there was no such operation			0
-- similarly , @entity14 said they need a full accounting of all foreigners who met with officials from the @entity84 and other agencies in the year prior to the attack			0
-- finally , @entity14 raises the issue of " possible witness intimidation , " saying the committee should investigate whether members of @entity84 or any government officials in the @entity10 or on the ground in @entity8 were " asked to sign non-disclosure agreements after the attack or asked to undergo polygraph tests ? if so , why were those requests made ? " he wrote			1
@entity16 has reported some involved in the @entity8 operation have been regularly polygraphed by their employer , the @entity4			2
the agency and its director , @entity179 , have vehemently denied those on the ground were subjected to retaliatory polygraphs and have said the director has encouraged operatives who wish to speak to @entity2 to come forward			0
the @entity4 says the @entity16 report is " patently false			0
" in its statement to the network , the agency said " not a single @entity4 officer who was on the ground in @entity8 during the attacks has been subjected to any @entity4 polygraph intended to discourage them from speaking to @entity2 or as a retaliation			2
" a spokesman added , " to date , some of these officers have already spoken to the oversight committees on @entity8			2
" @entity8 has remained a continuing thorn for the @entity199 administration as the @entity1 - led @entity48 has had five different committees investigating the conflicting stories of what triggered the terrorist attack and what some critics charge is an absence of a coherent explanation of what @entity58 was doing the night he was killed ; the military 's failure to launch a rescue mission and the @entity4 's role in @entity8 for months prior to the attack			1
the administration initially and stubbornly for several days insisted the @entity8 attack and the first murder of an @entity10 ambassador in more than 30 years was the result of a spontaneous demonstration over an @entity221 film			1
that was later proven wrong in testimony before the various committees .			0
