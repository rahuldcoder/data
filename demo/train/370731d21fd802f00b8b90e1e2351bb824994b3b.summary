@entity0 -- the computer contractor who exposed details of @entity6 surveillance programs was on the run late sunday , seeking asylum in @entity9 with the aid of the anti-secrecy group @entity11 , the organization and @entity9 's @entity13 announced			1
@entity14 left @entity15 after @entity16 sought his extradition on espionage charges , according to @entity11 , which facilitates the publication of classified information			1
" he is bound for the @entity9 via a safe route for the purposes of asylum and is being escorted by diplomats and legal advisers from @entity11 , " the group said			0
@entity9 's foreign ministry said it had received a request for asylum from @entity14 , and a @entity1 crew spotted a car with diplomatic plates and an @entity9 flag at the @entity35 capital 's international airport			2
@entity9 has already given @entity11 founder @entity36 refuge in its embassy in @entity39 for a year after he unsuccessfully fought extradition to @entity41 in @entity43 courts			0
in @entity16 , the response was swift			0
the @entity46 administration asked @entity9 , @entity48 and @entity49 , not to admit @entity14 or to expel him if they do , a senior @entity46 administration official told @entity1 on sunday			2
it also urged countries through which he might pass not to accept him			0
the @entity54 said it was " disappointed " in the decision by @entity15 authorities to allow @entity14 to leave the semi-autonomous @entity60 territory , arguing it had followed the proper legal steps to have him held and sent back to the @entity6			1
@entity6 and @entity15 officials had " repeated engagements " over the case , and attorney general @entity63 discussed the matter with his counterpart in @entity15 last week , the department said			1
" at no point , in all of our discussions through friday , did the authorities in @entity15 raise any issues regarding the sufficiency of the @entity6 's provisional arrest request , " a statement from the department said			1
" in light of this , we find their decision to be particularly troubling			0
" and a source familiar with the matter told @entity1 that the @entity6 government has revoked @entity14 's passport			1
@entity85 spokeswoman @entity84 said it was routine to revoke the passports of people charged with felonies			0
she would not comment specifically on the status of @entity14 's passport but said anyone wanted on a felony charge , " such as mr. @entity14 , " should be stopped from " any further international travel , other than is necessary to return him to the @entity6			1
" among those accompanying @entity14 is former @entity97 judge @entity96 , now the lawyer for @entity11 and @entity36 , according to a statement from the organization			2
" the @entity11 legal team and i are interested in preserving mr. @entity14 's rights and protecting him as a person , " @entity96 said			1
" what is being done to mr. @entity14 and to mr. @entity36 -- for making or facilitating disclosures in the public interest -- is an assault against the people			2
" @entity96 added in a statement monday that @entity14 has sought his legal advice			2
@entity96 said he has not yet decided whether to represent @entity14			2
@entity36 sought asylum in june 2012 to avoid extradition to @entity41 , where he is wanted for questioning over allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another			0
he has repeatedly said the allegations are politically motivated and that he fears @entity41 would transfer him to the @entity6			2
there are no charges pending against @entity36 in the @entity6			2
but a @entity120 private who military prosecutors say leaked a vast cache of classified documents to @entity11 is now being court - martialed on charges of aiding the enemy , and he faces life in prison if convicted			2
@entity14 has admitted he was the source who leaked classified documents about the @entity132 's surveillance programs to the @entity43 newspaper the @entity133 and to the @entity134			1
the documents revealed the existence of programs that collect records of domestic telephone calls in the @entity6 and monitor the internet activity of overseas residents			2
@entity132 chief : @entity14 ' betrayed ' our trust @entity14 gave up a comfortable life " in order to bring to light what he believed was serious wrongdoing on the part of our political officials , " said @entity153 , the @entity133 columnist who co-authored the stories			1
" and he 's now at best going to spend the rest of his life on the run from the most powerful government on @entity159			1
" the disclosures rocked the @entity46 administration and @entity6 intelligence , raising questions about whether the @entity132 was infringing on @entity6 civil liberties			1
@entity14 told the @entity133 that he exposed the surveillance programs because they posed a threat to democracy , but administration officials said the programs are vital to preventing terrorist attacks and are overseen by all three branches of government			0
" we have not in a single case had a place where a government official engaged in willful effort to circumvent or violate the law			0
zero times have we done that , " gen. @entity178 , the @entity132 's director , told @entity182 's " @entity181			1
" @entity14 was a @entity184 - based computer network administrator for @entity185 , an @entity132 contractor			1
@entity178 said @entity14 " betrayed the trust and confidence we had in him " and is " not acting , in my opinion , with noble intent			1
" " this was an individual with top - secret clearance , whose duty it was to administer these networks , " @entity178 said			0
" he betrayed that confidence and stole some of our secrets			0
" he said the super-secret communications intelligence agency has changed passwords and procedures since @entity14 's disclosures -- " but at the end of the day , we have to trust that our people are going to do the right thing			1
" @entity153 said @entity14 has been extremely judicious about what he has revealed			0
" i know that he has in his possession thousands of documents which if published would impose crippling damage on the @entity6 ' surveillance capabilities and systems around the world			0
he has never done any of that , " @entity153 told @entity1			0
" if his goal were to harm the @entity6 , there were all sorts of things he could have done , from uploading those documents on the internet to selling them to a foreign intelligence service			0
" @entity15 : extradition request did n't comply with requirements @entity14 left @entity15 " through a lawful and normal channel , " the government of the semi-autonomous @entity60 territory said sunday			1
the @entity6 government announced friday that it was charging @entity14 with espionage and theft of government property and asked @entity15 to hold him for extradition proceedings			1
in a statement sunday , @entity54 spokeswoman @entity232 said @entity15 authorities had informed @entity6 officials of @entity14 's departure			1
" we will continue to discuss this matter with @entity15 and pursue relevant law enforcement cooperation with other countries where mr. @entity14 may be attempting to travel , " she said			1
@entity15 said the @entity6 request for a provisional arrest warrant " did not fully comply with the legal requirements under @entity15 law " so it asked for additional information			1
because @entity15 did n't have enough information , " there is no legal basis to restrict mr. @entity14 from leaving @entity15 , " the government said			2
but a @entity54 official said sunday that the @entity6 had met requirements and disputed the assertion from @entity15 's government			1
" they came back to us with a few questions late friday and we were in the process of answering those questions , " the official said			0
" we believe we were meeting those requirements			0
as far as the relationship with @entity15 goes , this raises questions and we will continue to discuss with authorities there			0
" @entity15 's lack of intervention came after @entity14 told the @entity266 that @entity6 intelligence agents have been hacking computer networks in @entity15 and mainland @entity60 for years			1
the territory 's government said it has requested " clarification " about that in order " to protect the legal rights of the people of @entity15			2
" @entity14 ' told the truth in the name of privacy , ' @entity276 says president @entity46 , top legislators and national security officials defend the surveillance programs @entity14 detailed as necessary to combat terrorism and argue that some privacy must be sacrificed in a balanced approach			0
in a chat session moderated by the @entity133 last week , @entity14 said he went ahead with the leak because @entity46 worsened " abusive " practices instead of curtailing them as he promised as a candidate			0
@entity46 has been receiving updates on the @entity14 case from national security aides , a senior administration official told @entity1			0
but @entity14 's revelations also sparked criticism from @entity6 spy chief @entity297 , who told the @entity298 in march that the @entity132 did n't " wittingly " collect data on millions of @entity6			1
after @entity14 's revelations , @entity297 told @entity300 that he answered " in what i thought was the most truthful , or least untruthful manner " to the question from sen. @entity302 , @entity303			1
@entity306 sen. @entity276 of @entity307 told @entity1 's @entity308 that both @entity297 and @entity14 will be judged by history			2
" mr. @entity297 lied in @entity310 , in defiance of the law , in the name of security			0
mr. @entity14 told the truth in the name of privacy , " said @entity276 , the son of former @entity316 - turned - @entity306 presidential hopeful @entity315			0
@entity276 said that unlike civil rights protesters who broke the law and submitted to the courts to make a statement , @entity14 faces a " disproportionate " penalty			1
but he added that @entity14 's actions may be judged more harshly if he " cozies up " to an oppressive government overseas			1
" if he goes to an independent third country like @entity327 and if he refuses to talk to any sort of formal government about this , i think there 's a chance that he 'll be seen as an advocate of privacy , " @entity276 said			0
" if he cozies up to either the @entity35 government , the @entity60 government , or any of these governments that are perceived still as enemies of ours , i think that that will be a real problem for him in history			0
" @entity1 's @entity342 reported from @entity0			0
@entity1 's @entity343 and @entity344 reported from @entity345			0
@entity1 's @entity355 , @entity346 , @entity347 , @entity348 , @entity349 , @entity350 , @entity351 , @entity352 , @entity353 and @entity354 contributed to this report .			0
