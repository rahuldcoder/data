-- @entity2 's @entity1 is a quintet of villages clinging to a bit of rugged coastline between @entity7 and @entity8			1
long cut off from the modern world , this remote chunk of the @entity2 @entity10 only became easily accessible with the coming of the train			1
boats are a way of life in @entity17			1
each village is a variation on the same theme : a well - whittled , pastel jumble of homes , filling a gully like crusty sea creatures in a tide pool			1
locals are the barnacles -- hungry , but patient			1
and we travelers are like algae , coming in with the tide			1
since my mind goes on vacation with the rest of me when i 'm here , i think of the towns by number , east to west : no. 1 @entity39 ( a workaday town ) , no. 2 @entity41 ( picturesque ) , no. 3 @entity42 ( on a hilltop ) , no. 4 @entity17 ( the region 's dramatic cover girl ) , and no. 5 @entity46 ( the closest thing to a beach resort )			1
to preserve this land , the government has declared the @entity1 ( @entity53 - weh @entity52 ) a national park			1
for a small entrance fee ( about $ 8 for a one - day pass ) , visitors can hike the trail connecting all five towns , a trek that takes about five hours			1
you can choose any village for a home base , but @entity17 is my favorite			1
at the top end of town a little road hits a post , effectively a dead end for drivers			1
like the breakwater keeps out the waves at the bottom of town , the post keeps out the modern storm at the top			1
no cars enter this village of 600 people -- except on tuesday morning , when a few cars and trucks show up for a tailgate - party street market , augmenting the meager business community			1
@entity17 has the only natural harbor in the @entity1			1
in the @entity85 , there was no beach or square			1
the water went right up to the buildings , where boats would tie up , @entity90 - style			2
@entity17 's fishing fleet is down to just a couple of boats			2
still , @entity94 are more likely to own a boat than a car			2
boats remain on buoys , except in winter or when the red storm flag indicates bad seas			2
in that case they 're allowed to pull up onto the main square , usually reserved for restaurant tables			2
@entity17 has a humble little working beach -- a pebbled cove littered with scenes of a community that lives off the sea ... and travelers who love the views			2
well - worn locals fill the benches while tourists sunbathe on rocks			2
in the summer , the beach becomes a soccer ground , where teams fielded by local bars and restaurants provide late - night entertainment			2
the town has two halves			2
@entity124 ( @entity126 dialect for " flowery " ) is the sunny side on the left as you face inland , and luvegu ( dank ) is the shady side on the right			0
on the far right , a castle -- now just stones and a grassy park -- served as the town 's lookout back in pirate days			0
below the castle an interior arcade connected the houses -- ideal for fleeing attacks			0
these days , " @entity144 " colors are regulated by a commissioner of good taste in the regional government			0
@entity17 's harbor - front church is unusual for its strange entryway , which faces east ( altar side )			0
hanging on the wall inside are three historic portable crosses -- replicas of crosses that @entity17 ships once brought along on crusades to the @entity157			0
during @entity160 processions , these crosses are taken down and carried through town			0
located in front of the church , a tiny piazza -- decorated with a river rock mosaic -- is a popular hangout spot			0
it 's where @entity17 's old ladies soak up the last bit of sun , and kids enjoy a patch of level ball field			0
beyond the town , vineyards , with their many terraces , fill the mountainside			0
someone -- probably after too much local wine -- calculated that the roughly 3,000 miles of terrace walls have the same amount of stonework as the @entity184			0
wine production is down nowadays , as younger residents choose less physical work			0
but locals still maintain their tiny plots and proudly serve their family wines			0
evenings in @entity17 are well spent sitting on a bench and enjoying the scene , either with a gelato or a glass of local white wine ( borrow the glass from a bar , they do n't mind )			0
observe the passeggiata ( evening stroll ) , as locals meander lazily up and down the main street doing their vasca ( laps )			0
or gaze at the people looking out the windows of the faded pastel buildings , like a gallery of portraits hanging on ancient walls			0
here in @entity17 the generation that did n't grow up with television spends time posted at their windows , watching over a world as reassuring as the @entity218 tide			0
