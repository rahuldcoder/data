-- an @entity2 judge ruled tuesday that the band @entity3 must pay 5 percent of royalities from their 1980s hit " @entity7 " for plagiarizing a popular nursery rhyme about a @entity6 written in 1932			1
in february , @entity9 judge @entity8 found that the flute riff in " @entity7 " did mimic the @entity6 song			1
" i would emphasise that the findings i have made do not amount to a finding that the flute riff is a substantial part of @entity7 or that it is the ' hook ' of that song , " he said at the time			1
" @entity7 " was composed and performed by @entity3 founding member @entity16 in 1978			2
@entity17 added the flute riff after he joined the band in mid- 1979			0
according to court documents , @entity17 added the riff to the song to inject some " @entity2 flavor			2
" he admitted he had heard the song while growing up in the country in the late 1950s and was " pretty sure " that @entity6 was in his school 's song book			2
the song was written in 1932 by teacher @entity28 , and @entity2 music group @entity29 bought the copyright to it in 1990 after @entity28 's death in 1988			1
it was n't until a quiz show in 2007 that @entity34 managing director @entity34 became aware of the songs ' similarities and the potential for a law suit			0
@entity8 found that @entity39 deliberately included the bars from @entity6 into the flute line , but accepted that @entity16 did n't realize it was from the nursery rhyme until early in the last decade			1
@entity34 had sought 40 to 60 percent of the royalties earned by " @entity7 " in @entity2 since may 20 , 2002 , the limit imposed under @entity2 law			1
the ruling says it would make sense for the ruling to apply to future royalty payments			0
" i consider the figures put forward by @entity34 to be excessive , overreaching and unrealistic , " @entity8 said in tuesday 's ruling			0
" it 's just really a pity that @entity28 , the lady who wrote it , did n't participate in income from the song when the song was at its height in the early 80s , " @entity34 's lawyer @entity53 said in february			0
at the time , @entity62 said the company did not plan to sue overseas for royalties earned by the song outside @entity2			2
" to be honest , such things are theoretically possible but we 're keeping it simple , " he said			0
experts say the amount of damages payable will be limited by the judge 's finding that riff did not amount to the " hook " of the song			2
" there 's a lot more to ' @entity7 ' than that flute melody			0
it 's not the main melody and not the main hook and i suppose that in the end will mean that it will be a minor share of the royalties that this publisher can claim now , " said @entity81 , co-director of the masters program in @entity83 at @entity84 in @entity85			0
the shorter , more popular version of " @entity7 " was released in 1981 in @entity2 on the band 's hugely successful " @entity95 " album			1
by january 1983 , the single had topped the music charts in @entity2 , the @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and several @entity103 countries			1
@entity0 's @entity104 contributed to this report .			0
