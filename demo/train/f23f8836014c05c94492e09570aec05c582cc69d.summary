-- for a governor described as a " my way or the highway " kind of guy , @entity1 sounded mighty conciliatory on tuesday in trying to move his administration and his 2016 presidential ambitions past a swirling controversy over alleged political retribution			1
the @entity12 @entity11 repeatedly emphasized bipartisan efforts and working together in a state of the state address that took on special prominence because of investigations into whether his staff orchestrated traffic gridlock near the country 's busiest bridge to punish a @entity23 mayor for refusing to endorse his re-election last year			1
with the national spotlight on an annual speech normally given little attention outside the state , @entity1 sought to reframe the political focus away from the @entity31 controversy by citing the successes of his first term and calling for cooperation from the @entity23 - led @entity36 and @entity37			1
first came the bad , with @entity1 addressing the scandal in his first sentences by accepting ultimate responsibility even though he said last week he knew nothing about it			1
" mistakes were clearly made , and as a result , we let down the people we are entrusted to serve , " @entity1 told state legislators gathered in @entity47 for the speech intended to outline policy plans for the state			2
his administration will cooperate " with all appropriate inquiries " into the controversy to " ensure this breach of trust does not happen again , " @entity1 said before shifting away from the issue by saying the scandal " does not define us or our state " and will not delay " the work that needs to be done to improve the people 's lives in @entity12			1
" instead , @entity1 emphasized economic successes of his first term and called for cooperation from the @entity23 - led @entity36 and @entity37			2
in a span of 10 paragraphs , he used the word " we " 17 times in describing specific achievements such as job creation and economic growth			0
outlining a conservative agenda of no additional taxes and more law enforcement , the recently re-elected governor also proposed education reforms and programs to help drug offenders rejoin society			0
the most emotional moment came well into the nearly hour - long address when @entity1 told the story of @entity86 , a former drug addict from his hometown now working as a practicing attorney			2
@entity86 , who was seated near the front , stood up and hugged the governor to a lengthy ovation			0
by tradition , legislators stood and applauded when @entity1 arrived , and he received repeated ovations when citing accomplishments of his first term and outlining new proposals			0
however , the bridge controversy remains prominent for the early frontrunner for the @entity11 presidential nomination in 2016			0
last week , the @entity101 committee investigating the matter made public more than 2,000 pages of documents suggesting politics was behind the unannounced lane closures on the @entity12 side of the bridge last september that caused traffic gridlock in @entity110			2
the documents suggest that top @entity1 aides orchestrated the traffic mess to punish that town 's mayor for not endorsing their boss , and that they allegedly tried to stonewall media inquiries into the matter			1
@entity119 on bridge scandal : i think laws were broken @entity1 fired one top adviser for her apparent role in the scandal and other key advisers have left their jobs			2
he has repeatedly apologized for being " blindsided " by what his aides and appointees were doing			0
after @entity1 's reference to the controversy in tuesday 's speech , a top @entity134 in the @entity12 legislature who heads an investigating panel rejected the governor 's insistence he knew nothing about the lane closures			1
" i find that a little hard to believe , " assemblyman @entity141 told @entity0			0
@entity141 described relations between @entity12 @entity23 and @entity1 as " very difficult , " saying the governor " set lines in the sand " and " said it 's my way or the highway			1
" " @entity148 means both sides give			0
that 's not how this governor operates , " @entity141 said			0
meanwhile , the assembly 's @entity11 leader said he believed that @entity1 knew nothing about what happened			2
" if a governor lies about what he knows , that 's troublesome			0
that did n't happen here , " @entity159 said			0
federal officials also are looking at whether @entity1 improperly used @entity164 relief funds to produce tourism ads promoting the @entity167 's recovery that starred him and his family			1
in the new inquiry , federal auditors will examine @entity12 's use of $ 25 million of the funds for the marketing campaign , @entity12 @entity23 rep. @entity170 told @entity0			1
in a statement on monday , @entity1 's office said the " @entity189 " campaign was part of an " action plan " approved by the @entity181 administration and developed with the goal of showing that the new jersey shore was open for business just several months after the storm that devastated parts of the mid @entity187 in october 2012			2
a separate statement tuesday by the federal @entity191 described the probe as a routine audit " and not an investigation of the procurement process			0
" while political observers say the bridge scandal is n't good for @entity1 , the @entity164 investigation has the potential to be much more damaging to his national image since it was his signature achievement following the storm			1
feds investigate @entity1 's use of @entity164 relief funds on tuesday , @entity1 did not specifically mention that audit by the @entity191 inspector general , a watchdog over federal spending			1
in what might have been an ironic reference to @entity164 funding , @entity1 praised the cooperative spirit in the state that helped its recovery from the storm , seeming to describe his own challenges now			1
" let that spirit of @entity164 be a powerful lesson to all of us , that when times are most difficult , cooperation and progress are possible , " @entity1 said			1
" indeed , i tell you , they 're necessary			0
" @entity0 's @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 and @entity230 contributed to this report			0
