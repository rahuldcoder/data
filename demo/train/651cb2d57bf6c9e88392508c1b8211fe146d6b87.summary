@entity0 , @entity1 -- audio recordings locked inside a college library in the @entity5 might help solve a decades - old murder mystery , but the release of those tapes could damage the fragile peace in @entity1			1
in december 1972 , the widow @entity10 was taken from her home in @entity0 and her 10 children			2
" they came about tea time and they dragged her out of the bathroom and dragged her out , " remembers @entity10 's daughter , @entity13 , who was then a teenager			2
ever since , @entity13 has been on a 40 - year quest for answers			2
" all i ever wanted was to know the reason why they killed my mother , " @entity13 explained			2
" i 've lived all my life in fear , " @entity13 added			2
" they destroyed my mother 's life , my family life			1
" @entity13 believes tapes locked away in @entity32 's library may hold the truth about her mother 's fate			1
but there are fears that the tapes may also cause embarrassment or worse for @entity40 , the prominent @entity41 politician who helped broker peace in @entity1			1
the recordings were made as part of the @entity45 , which is a collection of interviews conducted with former @entity1 paramilitary fighters			1
they provide an oral history of the decades of sectarian fighting that became known as @entity52			1
reminders of @entity56 ' troubles ' rise to surface @entity1 is part of @entity59 and @entity60 fighters wanted to keep it that way			1
@entity63 were fighting to force the @entity59 out and reunify the north with the rest of @entity1			1
the former combatants believed that their recorded interviews would be kept secret until their death			1
but that may no longer be possible as @entity1 police are asking the @entity5 government to hand over some of the tapes			1
the police say they were alerted to the secret archive by the book , " @entity82 , " written by @entity45 archive manager @entity77 , which is based on transcripts from two of the recorded interviews			1
one of those featured is @entity84 , a now - deceased former commander of the @entity85 or @entity85 , a @entity41 paramilitary			2
@entity84 told his interviewer : " i have never , ever , ever admitted being a member of the @entity85 , ever			2
i 've just done it here			0
" and he talked about @entity10 's murder , stating : " i knew she was being executed			0
i did n't know she was going to be buried or disappeared as they call them now			0
" @entity84 went on to allege @entity40 was involved : " the special squad was brought into the operation then , called the @entity98			0
you know when anyone needed to be taken away they normally done it			0
i had no control over this squad			0
@entity40 had control over this particular squad			0
" @entity84 added he regretted what happened : " looking back on it now , what happened to the woman was wrong			0
" @entity84 said in his taped interview , @entity10 was killed because the @entity85 believed she was working with the @entity59 army			0
the @entity113 do not believe she was a spy , saying she was too busy looking after her 10 children to be an informer			0
@entity40 , leader of @entity1 's @entity117 party , refused to be interviewed by @entity2 for this story			1
but , he has said many times before that he was never in the @entity85 and never involved in the death of @entity10 , and has labeled as libelous any allegation he was involved in the @entity10 murder			0
his spokesman goes further , labeling @entity40 ' critics as anti the peace process			0
@entity40 ' denial of @entity85 membership angers his old comrades like @entity84			0
" it means that people like myself had to carry the responsibility of all those deaths , " @entity84 said on the interview tape			0
" @entity40 was a major , major player in the war and yet he 's standing there denying it			0
" the @entity1 police vow to " follow the material in the @entity146 all way to court if that 's where it takes them ... they say detectives have a legal responsibility to investigate murders ... and follow all lines of inquiry			1
" the @entity59 government 's most senior politician on @entity1 , @entity153 told @entity2 that no one person is above the law			1
" there can be no concept on amnesty , so we have to support the police to have complete operational independence in pursuing every line of inquiry in bringing those who committed crimes to justice , " @entity153 said			1
right now the @entity168 archive manager , @entity77 , is furious with @entity32 for initially giving in too quickly to subpoenas demanding they hand over some of the tapes to a @entity5 judge			1
he says it puts lives in danger , damages the future of truth recovery , oral histories and academic research			1
@entity77 -- who is appealing to try to stop the court from handing the tapes it has to police -- wants the tapes handed back to the people who told their stories			1
" @entity32 is no longer a fit and proper place to keep these interviews , " @entity77 insists			0
" the archives should be closed down , and the interviews should be returned to the people who gave them because they 're not safe			0
" but there seems to be little chance of that , @entity32 's spokesman @entity192 blames @entity77			0
" from the beginning , we said to the project organizer , who approached us with this idea , that there were limitations regarding the assurances of confidentiality under @entity5 law , " @entity192 said			0
but what worries @entity77 is that if the police get tapes relating to @entity10 's murder , they could quickly find other crimes to investigate implicating more political leaders and the police could soon demand all the tapes in the archive			1
few believe the police will get @entity40 to court in part because he is inoculated from prosecution by his central role silencing @entity85 guns and delivering peace , and in part because the tapes alone can not secure a conviction			1
former @entity85 man @entity225 recorded a statement for the @entity32 archives and says lawyers told him under @entity59 law the tapes can not be used in court			2
" i find it just imponderable , why the police are going down this road when they must know that there is no chance of obtaining any convictions at the end of this , " @entity225 says			2
like many other @entity63 , @entity225 thinks the police are biased against them , trying to settle old scores and bring @entity40 and others down			2
but for @entity13 , herself a @entity41 getting access to the tapes is about so much more			1
for her , it 's not only about justice but a release from the pain of never knowing the truth			0
" they tried to destroy what life i have now , " she says			0
" they are the people who committed the crimes in this			0

tapes made in secret by former fighters across sectarian divide offer chilling *insights*
now a fight is *brewing* over whether police can have access to them
@entity1 police and one family think the tapes may help victims of the violence
researchers say releasing the tapes puts at risk the lives of those who spoke to them
