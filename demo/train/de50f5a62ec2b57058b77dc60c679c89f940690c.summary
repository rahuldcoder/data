-- @entity1 , the first openly gay bishop in the @entity2 , said saturday that death threats and continued worldwide controversy about his selection contributed to his decision to retire in january 2013			1
@entity1 's announced retirement surprised many of those attending the annual diocesan convention in @entity11 , @entity12			1
the bishop , who has served in the post in @entity12 since early 2004 , said he is energized about his next two years of ministry and support of clergy and congregations as the process of naming his successor moves forward			1
but turning 66 in 2013 and the " constant strain " from the church schism were factors in his decision , @entity1 said in prepared remarks			1
the bishop said he is in his fifth year of sobriety after receiving treatment for alcohol abuse			2
" the fact is , the last seven years have taken their toll on me , my family , and you , " he told those attending the convention			0
" while i believe that these attitudes , mostly outside the @entity37 , have not distracted me from my service to you , i would be less than honest if i did n't say that they have certainly added a burden and certain anxiety to my episcopate			0
" conservative factions in the @entity45 , a 77 million - member denomination worldwide that includes the @entity2 , have opposed the ordination of gay bishops			1
@entity1 's appointment prompted a semi-official moratorium on naming new gay bishops , but they revoked that ban last year			1
in may , the @entity2 consecrated its first openly lesbian bishop in the face of objections from some conservative @entity55			1
a number of @entity2 dioceses broke with the official church structure , forming the breakaway @entity59 in protest of the church 's stance on homosexuality			2
after his selection in 2003 , @entity1 told @entity0 he was prepared to serve as bishop			1
" the only thing that is sort of weighing on my heart is knowing this is very difficult for many people in our church , and for those people for whom this is confusing or disturbing , " he said			0
" i 'm very sorry about that			0
but i am feeling very calm about moving forward , that this is in fact what @entity78 wants for me			0
although he has often spoken about his sexual orientation , the bishop told the audience saturday that he does n't always wanted to be identified with it			2
" @entity12 is always the place i remain , simply , ' the @entity85 , ' " he said			2
" this is the one place on earth where i am not ' the gay @entity85			2
' i believe that you elected me because you believed me to be the right person to lead you at this time			0
the world has sometimes questioned that , but i hope you never did			0
" @entity1 , who is in a same - sex relationship , said he has evangelized gay and lesbian people in order to " make the case for @entity78 and @entity95			1
" he also made reference saturday to the recently publicized suicides of gay and lesbian teenagers			0
" [ they ] have taken their own lives because religion tells them they are an abomination before @entity78 and who believe their lives are doomed to despair and unhappiness , " the bishop said			0
" i go tell them a different story			0
