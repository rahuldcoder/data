@entity0 -- a teenager has been arrested near @entity0 in connection with the hacking of @entity6 , @entity0 's @entity2 said tuesday			1
the 19 - year - old is suspected of hacking into systems and mounting denial of service attacks against " a number of international businesses and intelligence agencies , " police said			1
naming suspects who have been arrested is illegal in @entity15			1
a police spokesman , who declined to be named in line with custom , said the arrested man 's computers will be examined for activities related to hacks against the @entity15 's @entity23 , the @entity24 and @entity6			1
@entity6 's @entity25 went down on april 20 after what @entity6 said was a massive data breach			1
it had more than 70 million subscribers at the time			0
it began coming back online in mid-may			0
the @entity31 did not reopen until june 2			0
the company estimated the cost of that attack will total $ 171 million			0
hackers later broke into @entity37 ' website , compromising the accounts of over 1 million users , and the gaming company @entity40 , stealing nearly 1.3 million users ' details via a @entity15 subsidiary of the @entity45 company			2
@entity40 makes games for @entity25 and other gaming systems			0
the suspect 's computer will also be examined for links to @entity53 , another police spokesman told @entity1 , who also declined to be named in line with custom			1
" this link has not been established yet as it is still early days , " the spokesman said			0
the hacker group @entity53 posted an irreverent denial that its leader was the one arrested			1
" seems the glorious leader of @entity53 got arrested , it 's all over now ... wait ... we 're all still here ! which poor bastard did they take down ? " they said on @entity66 several hours after the announcement of the arrest			1
@entity53 claimed recently to have attacked the @entity24 website , and took credit for hacking into the website of the @entity75 public broadcaster @entity76 and posting a fake story saying the rapper @entity78 was still alive			1
he was killed nearly 15 years ago			0
it 's unclear whether @entity53 members played a role in the @entity25 breach			1
but they have posted on their website what they claim is proprietary information from @entity37 and other @entity6 properties ' websites			2
on friday , on the occasion of their 1,000th tweet , the group posted a manifesto of sorts in which they said people , including their targets and advocates of internet freedom , should be thankful			2
" the main @entity100 argument suggests that ... our actions are causing clowns with pens to write new rules for you , " the group wrote			0
" but what if we just had n't released anything ? what if we were silent ? that would mean we would be secretly inside @entity111 affiliates right now , inside @entity76 , inside @entity6 ... watching ... abusing ...			2
" they seemed to suggest that by making their attacks public , they 'll push websites to increase security			0
they said they 're sitting on account information for 200,000 players of the online game @entity123 , but moments later said that releasing people 's information is worth doing sometimes because it 's fun			2
" yes , yes , there 's always the argument that releasing everything in full is just as evil , what with accounts being stolen and abused , but welcome to 2011 , " they wrote			0
" this is the lulz lizard era , where we do things just because we find it entertaining			0
" analysts said the group appears to be some sort of spin - off of " @entity143 , " the loose coalition of hackers that grew to prominence through their support of the whistle - blower site @entity149			0
but while @entity143 has its own set of moral codes and is largely politically motivated , @entity53 seems to be random			2
for every hack like the one on @entity76 , which the group said came out of anger over a documentary about @entity149 , there 's the cracking of porn site @entity159 -- and a subsequent public list of members ' e-mail addresses and passwords			2
the teen suspect was arrested in @entity165 , outside @entity0 , in a raid that police said was " intelligence - led			1
" the suspect was arrested monday night and police are now examining a " significant amount of material , " they said			1
@entity1 's @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 contributed to this report .			0
