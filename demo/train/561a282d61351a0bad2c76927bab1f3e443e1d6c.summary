@entity0 , @entity2 government forces and rebels in @entity2 agreed to a ceasefire monday after heavy fighting in the capital , @entity0 , @entity2 's interior minister and a rebel official said			1
that news came after fighting around the presidential palace and came after @entity2 's prime minister went into hiding when attackers shot at him			1
nine people were killed and 67 others injured iin the clashes , @entity2 's @entity15 said			1
the @entity2 government , a @entity21 ally in the battle against @entity23 , described the fighting as a power grab by rebels known as @entity27 , @entity28 who have long felt marginalized in the majority @entity31 country			1
turmoil between the two sides is worrisome to the @entity35 because a power vacuum in @entity2 could benefit @entity37 , a terrorist organization based in @entity2 that took credit for the attack on the offices of @entity41 in @entity42 ; it also tried to blow up a plane landing in @entity44 in 2009			1
a @entity46 delegate , @entity45 , told @entity6 that the presidential committee had agreed to a deal after hours of negotiations			2
interior minister @entity50 also confirmed the ceasefire had been reached			2
there are conflicting accounts of the cause of the clashes			2
government officials characterize it as a power grab by the @entity27			2
houthis say @entity2 's military attacked people demanding that authorities lift road closures introduced as a security measure after the presidential chief of staff was abducted in @entity0 a few days ago			1
a @entity67 diplomat in @entity0 told @entity6 the situation was complex			0
" today 's events appear to be the next stage in @entity27 plans to extend their control in @entity2			1
but there are many players with many agendas			0
so this has n't finished playing out , " the diplomat said			0
it is unclear who fired first near the presidential palace monday			2
control of the palace is seen as key to the control of the country			0
there were reports of government buildings , a hospital and residential buildings being hit			0
the presidential palace is controlled by the government and mountaintops surrounding the palace are held by rebels known as @entity27 , a senior interior ministry official told @entity6 late monday			2
both sides will remain where they are until a deal is signed , which is expected to happen tuesday , said the official			2
the @entity2 information minister told @entity6 's @entity100 that government control is " almost nonexistent			1
" when asked to described the situation on the ground , @entity102 said : " this is almost a replica of what happened in september , on the 21st of september , when the @entity27 came into the city and took over everything , and then there was the peace and partnership agreement , where they pulled back a little bit and allowed a government to be created			0
" " now , since then , the @entity27 have not really left the capital			0
they 've been around with their arms , and what happened is that they 've been interfering in the government 's work , but we were trying to get this country going , " the minister said			1
the @entity123 will hold a special meeting to discuss @entity2 on tuesday			1
prime minister @entity125 was fired upon when he left a meeting with president @entity127 and the @entity46 political group @entity128 , @entity129 said			1
@entity125 was unharmed and is now in hiding , she said			0
" he is at his place , but currently he has been surrounded by @entity46 militias around his place , and they have stationed themselves at rooftops of neighboring buildings			0
he is worried that the situation might escalate , " said the minister			2
the senior interior ministry official said the prime minister was inside the @entity143 palace , some 7 miles ( 12 kilometers ) from the presidential palace			1
the gunfire came from a @entity46 checkpoint near the meeting place , and the attempt to kill the prime minister was a breach on an earlier ceasefire , @entity129 said			1
but a senior @entity46 official condemned the attack and denied the group had anything to do with it , blaming the attempt on an unnamed third party			0
@entity27 said their convoy had also been fired upon after leaving the talks			0
adding to the disputes , the information minister said @entity2 state tv and the state - run @entity164 are now under the control of the @entity27 political movement			1
but senior @entity46 official @entity168 denied the movement controlled either news outlet			0
there are concerns that as @entity2 spirals into greater sectarian violence , @entity23 , a predominantly @entity31 group , will gain an even greater foothold there , with more recruits and a base from which to attack other targets			1
" this morning , it was so chaotic			0
they said that nobody knew what was going on and who was in charge , and these are situations where @entity23 can easily infiltrate and create , " @entity129 told @entity6			0
@entity37 has its home in @entity2 , where in recent months , it has come under pressure from @entity46 rebels and government forces			1
but the @entity41 attack may show the group 's apparent ability to direct operations beyond @entity2 's borders			1
it is thought likely that one or both of the brothers behind the attack in @entity42 visited @entity2 and received weapons training from @entity37 and that one may have met with the group 's former leader			1
a @entity21 official said the @entity21 was monitoring the violence monday and had sufficient military power nearby to evacuate its embassy " on short notice " if needed			2
@entity129 said gunmen linked to the @entity27 political movement attacked the presidential palace in a bid to take control of the symbol of power			1
@entity127 , the president , was not in the building and is safe , @entity129 said , but government officials were among an unknown number of casualties			0
@entity46 rebels claimed responsibility saturday for the abduction of presidential chief of staff @entity222			1
@entity129 said monday 's dispute began when the government tried to implement a security plan as it feared more abductions of key staff			1
but a top @entity46 official said @entity27 tried to mediate with the army and asked for roads to be opened for citizens , which led to their people getting attacked			2
he said they then had to defend themselves			0
@entity127 appointed @entity222 as premier in october , but the rebels rejected the nomination			0
@entity238 , senior media adviser to the @entity46 movement in @entity2 , said the @entity27 had detained @entity222 as a message to the president			1
it was because the president wanted to introduce a new constitution without the approval of the @entity27 , @entity242 said			0
the abduction came amid increased tensions in the @entity250 country after the rise of @entity46 rebels			0
@entity27 swept into the capital last year , sparking battles that left more than 300 dead in a month			0
in september , @entity27 signed a ceasefire deal with the government			0
since then , its members have installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions			0
@entity127 was elected president in february 2012			0
he was the only candidate on the ballot			0
