-- as the scale of the humanitarian crisis in @entity3 mounts , so have the calls for military intervention			1
@entity7 's regime has been brutal , calculating and impervious to world opinion ; with the assistance of @entity10 and @entity11 , it has dodged a @entity13 mandate to halt the attacks on its own people			0
the now - familiar pattern of the @entity18 -- popular outcries for freedom provoking hideous repression , which we saw in @entity23 in 2011 -- seems to warrant military intervention to stop the slaughter in @entity3			1
but first we need answers to some hard questions			0
we have just exited @entity28 after 8Â½ years , a cost of more than $ 1 trillion and a loss of some 5,000 @entity32 service members			0
and @entity28 is still a cockpit for sectarian struggle and violence			0
in @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity23 , strong @entity37 sentiments have inevitably surfaced despite the democratic and @entity42 - oriented facade of the initial @entity18 uprisings			2
the future orientation of these states is likely to be less helpful to @entity32 aims and policies in the region than their predecessors			0
and overshadowing @entity3 is the worry of @entity52 's nuclear ambition , and the fact that " all " options must be kept available in case diplomacy fails there			2
so , in the case of @entity3 , we must ask , first , what are the @entity32 national interests at stake ? what is our objective ? then , how would the use of force attain that objective ? how much force , how applied , at what cost ? what is the end state we seek ? what basis in international law is there for action ? which allies will help us ? and , when all is said and done , have we actually achieved what we set out to do , and at a cost and risk proportionate to @entity32 interests ? in addition to humanitarian concerns , there are significant @entity32 strategic interests at play in @entity3			1
the @entity3 regime is a " front - line " state to @entity32 's ally @entity89 , and so is critical to lasting peace there			2
and while the @entity3 regime has flirted with a peace agreement , it has also served as a conduit of @entity52 influence and threats			2
@entity97 calls for airstrikes on @entity3 @entity3 hosts @entity52 advisers and assists @entity100 , an @entity52 - backed fighting force that has squeezed and threatened @entity89 from the north , provoked one border war already , taken a powerful and coercive role inside neighboring @entity105 , and which serves as a major factor of regional intimidation as @entity52 angles to attain its nuclear aims			1
moreover , the @entity3 regime is a @entity110 relic , maintaining a strong military and inviting ties with @entity32 's geostrategic competitor , @entity10			1
unlike the case of @entity23 , the @entity32 has substantial strategic interests in @entity3 but would be facing a strong , capable military still mostly loyal to @entity7			1
@entity3 is less accessible militarily than @entity23 , with a population triple its size -- 22 million , including some 2 million @entity119			1
opinion : @entity121 should n't stay silent in face of regime 's brutality weapons are flowing in , refugees are fleeing , but there seems to be little in the way of an organized @entity3 opposition with which to work			2
and while @entity131 and @entity132 are calling for @entity7 's removal , this seems more of an opportunistic @entity135 strategy			0
among the resistance forces are apparently some radical @entity138 fighters , perhaps @entity139 itself , and others whose ascension to power would likely cause a further crisis , with millions of @entity119 and other religious minorities fleeing from the region			0
while the @entity32 aim in ending the violence and saving lives is obvious , this is a much more complicated and demanding scenario than @entity23			1
there is as yet no international mandate , not even from @entity151			0
the most appropriate form of intervention is reportedly under study -- but it looks like almost any course of action will increase the violence , not reduce it			1
and who will be available in the skies and on the ground to help ? how will a new government be formed , and how will @entity3 be managed until then ? what is needed right now is clear thinking , solid planning and a well - supported international strategy for the region , including @entity52 -- before we act			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .			0

@entity171 : the calls for military action to stop @entity3 slaughter are *understandable*
he says there are a host of *unanswered* questions to deal with
intervention in @entity3 would be much tougher than in @entity23 , he says
@entity171 : it looks like every course of action would increase , rather than curb , violence
