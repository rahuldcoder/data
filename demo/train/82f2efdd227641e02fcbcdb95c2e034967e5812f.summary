-- when @entity2 announced that @entity3 would return to the champion motorcycling team this season , many wondered if he would be able to repair his previously fractious relationship with teammate @entity7			1
however , the threat to @entity7 's status as world champion is coming from an unexpected source -- @entity15 's rookie @entity13 rider @entity12			1
the 20 - year - old has won his last two battles with @entity7 , becoming the youngest winner of a top - level race in @entity20 , @entity21 last month and then on sunday edging his fellow @entity22 into third place after an audacious final - corner overtake which saw the two bikes make contact			1
what made it harder for @entity7 to bear was that it came at the part of the @entity32 track which had been named in his honor ahead of this weekend 's @entity35			1
" if somebody did that to me ... for sure , i would be angry , " @entity12 told the @entity13 website			2
" not because of the moment but because i would have lost a place on the podium			0
i can understand that but , anyway , i have said sorry			0
" i thought he would close the corner off a little bit more than he did , but i noticed that he had opened the door so i tried to pass him			2
when i saw in those last meters that i might touch him , i released the brakes a bit to make sure the touch was going to be a bit softer			0
" the most important thing is that we both finished and i just hope that our relationship will get a bit better after a few days			0
" the result left @entity12 on his own at the top of the championship standings , while @entity7 dropped to third behind race winner @entity59			1
" i was second all race and lost it at the last corner , " @entity7 said			2
" anyway , our bike was not very competitive compared to the @entity63			0
" i had a very consistent race , just making two mistakes : i started very badly and did n't close the door enough at the last corner			0
" @entity59 celebrated his first win this season and his first at his home race since 2008			2
" it was a beautiful race , " the @entity15 rider said			0
" i was able to ride the bike well , even though it was difficult because the tires were really on the limit			0
i could n't push too hard because of that , so i had to ride carefully			0
" seven - time world champion @entity3 finished fourth ahead of @entity78 's @entity77 on a @entity79			1
" unfortunately , i did n't have enough pace at the beginning because we did not find the right balance , " said @entity3 , who is also fourth overall -- 18 points behind @entity12 ahead of the next race at @entity83			1
" we have to work very hard -- especially because @entity7 is faster than us -- so we have to find the right balance and work together with @entity2 because in this race we expected to be stronger than the @entity63 but in the end we have finished behind them , so we have a lot of work to do			1
