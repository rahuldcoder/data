it 's an alleged true - life story that trumps @entity2 's latest castaway tale			1
thirteen months adrift at sea ( maybe more )			1
survival with only what nature and the elements provided			2
@entity8 washed up on a remote coral atoll in the @entity10 last week in a heavily damaged boat			1
he said he had been living off fish and turtles he had caught and relying on rainwater , and sometimes his own urine , to drink			1
he said he had been lost at sea for 13 months , after setting off from southern @entity17 -- thousands of miles to the east			2
many questions remain about how he could have lived on his small boat for so long as it drifted across the ocean			1
scientifically , his ordeal is plausible			2
but is it probable ? @entity8 told @entity25 in an exclusive interview that he left from a port called @entity28 in @entity17 's @entity30 state in december 2012			1
a @entity17 newspaper visited the nearby hamlet where @entity8 lived near @entity17 's @entity33			1
local fishermen there say they remember @entity8 and the day he went to sea and did n't come back			1
they recall the date of departure being in november , a month earlier than the castaway remembers			1
boats went looking for him and his boat companion			1
the state sent an airplane to search for him			2
" all of my fellow fishermen were elated because this is nothing short of a miracle			2
i have no words to describe the joy i felt when i learned he was alive			2
he 's a wonderful human being and i 'm glad he made it , " @entity53 , owner of @entity8 's boat , told @entity25			1
he said the boat was equipped with a gps system and radio communication , but both systems got wet and stopped working when a storm hit			2
" when they told me that a boat had appeared with somebody on board i had no doubts , " @entity63 said			0
" i recognized @entity8 immediately when i saw his picture			1
it could n't be anyone else			0
the boat and the registration number check			0
" who is this man ? authorities are trying to determine the veracity of @entity8 's story			1
the @entity17 government has confirmed his identity and says he is a @entity81 national who was living in the city of @entity83			0
the local fishermen told @entity86 newspaper he actually lived nearby at a place called @entity88			1
@entity89 , the @entity17 ambassador to the @entity90 , said tuesday that @entity8 is still recovering in a hospital in the @entity10 after being found in a " weak state of mind and health			1
" he 'll be repatriated to @entity81 as soon as possible , once he is medically cleared to travel and has the correct documentation , the ambassador said			0
no time frame for the repatriation has been established yet			0
@entity100 's tale how did a man survive such an ordeal -- as @entity8 describes -- in a boat about the length of three people and the width of one person ? he pointed upward and said , " @entity108			1
... my faith in @entity108			0
" " i thought , ' i am going to get out , ' " he said			1
" get out , get out , get out			0
" but he also admitted to dark moments , saying he considered killing himself			1
" twice i wanted to , " he said , as he gestured at slitting his throat			0
" i wanted to with a knife			0
when i did n't have water , food ; i gave up and i grabbed a knife			1
" but he says he was too " scared " to go through with it			0
losing his companion @entity8 says he left for what was supposed to be a one - day trip to catch sharks on december 21 , 2012			1
by his account , he and his teenage companion had already killed some sharks and had 400 kilograms ( about 880 pounds ) of the animals on the boat			2
but they would not have the shark meat to survive			0
" we threw it into the water			2
it was too much weight , and there was too much wind , " he said			0
" three days later , we wish we had what we had thrown away			0
we wanted to eat it , but the sea had already taken it away			0
" @entity8 said that he and his companion were blown off course by northerly winds and then caught in a storm , eventually losing use of their engines			1
they had no radio signal to report their plight , he said			0
according to @entity148 of the @entity10 @entity149 , @entity8 said that four weeks into their drift , he lost the young man because he refused to eat raw birds			1
there are no details yet on what @entity8 did with the young man 's body			1
@entity63 , the boat owner , identified @entity8 's companion as 23 - year - old @entity160			1
he said he was single with no children , but his parents , siblings and extended family live nearby			0
in his interview with @entity25 , the castaway mentioned his companion only in passing , saying he believed that the boy 's parents knew he was missing			1
lost at sea during his long period at sea , @entity8 said he lost track of the date and the day of the week			1
he would follow the sun 's path across the sky , he said , indicating the movement with his hands as he spoke			2
" i did n't know the date or the day -- only the hours			0
only that there was a sunset and a sunrise , nothing else , " he said			0
when there was no rain , he would resort to consuming his own urine , he said			2
" then it rained , oh , what happiness ! " @entity8 said			1
the boat itself was a container to collect the precious rainwater			2
he also ate sea turtles			2
" they would bang the boat -- boom , boom , boom -- and i would get up " and grab them from the water , he said			2
finding land after 13 or 14 months at sea , @entity8 says , the boat finally reached shore			1
he swam to land and spent a night in the woods			0
he said he did n't have the energy to climb up the coconut trees he saw but was excited to eat a coconut he found on the ground			0
the next morning , according to @entity8 , he walked and found a small house and started shouting			1
a man and woman came to him , he said			0
" i took them to see the boat , because they did n't understand me , " @entity8 said			1
he gave them the boat as a gift , he said			0
' much better shape ' than expected @entity8 was found on sparsely populated @entity218 , a 22 - hour boat ride from the @entity10 capital of @entity221 , on thursday			1
the southernmost of the @entity10 ' atolls , @entity218 has only 2.2 square miles of land , one phone line and no internet service			0
the government airplane that services the atoll was not working , so @entity8 did not make it to @entity221 until monday morning			1
people on the island where he was found thursday say the 26 - foot fiberglass boat was in very bad condition , covered in barnacles and with the carcasses of several turtles littering the deck			2
video from @entity221 shows @entity8 walking a gangplank from a government boat to a waiting ambulance			1
waving to those gathered around the dock , he is supported by a medical assistant as he walks			0
from inside the ambulance , he gives a thumbs up before it drives away			0
" he 's in much better shape than one would expect after such an ordeal , " said @entity246 , @entity247 ambassador to the @entity10			2
officials do n't doubt story if @entity8 's story proves true , the trip across the @entity33 would have taken him across roughly 6,600 miles ( 10,800 kilometers ) of open ocean before ending in the @entity10 , about halfway between @entity255 and @entity256 , in the @entity257			1
officials in the islands say they have no reason to doubt what he has told them so far , the @entity17 ambassador said			0
such an amazing journey is n't unheard of in the small @entity33 nation , as three @entity17 fishermen made a similar drift voyage in 2006 that lasted nine months			0
those men lived off fish they caught and rainwater , and they read the @entity270 for comfort			1
conditions in the @entity33 make the timeline of @entity8 's journey plausible , said @entity275 , a producer for @entity276			1
@entity275 said that given the average currents between @entity17 and the @entity10 , it would have taken less than a year to travel from the origin to the end in the strongest average currents			0
if the trip did indeed take 13 - 1/2 months , it means his boat would have averaged about 18.6 miles ( 30 kilometers ) a day			0
but @entity275 said a meandering journey in and out of the currents was most likely			0
' we will have him back soon ' @entity8 is from @entity288 in @entity81 , where @entity25 caught up with members of his family			1
they said they had n't heard from him in about eight years and thought he might be dead			2
he has a 12 - year - old daughter there who does n't remember her father			0
" my heart would tell me that my son was not dead , but i wondered about it so often that i had started to lose faith , " said @entity296 , his mother			0
" @entity108 willing , my son is not dead			0
@entity108 willing , my son is alive			0
and we 're going to see him again one day			0
i 'm very happy after learning that he 's alive and that we will have him back home soon , " said his father , @entity302			2
but seeing what their son has been through also brings them feelings of sadness , he added			0
" the last time we saw him , we did n't want him to go , " his father said			0
in the @entity10 , @entity8 had this message for his family : " that i 'm alive , that i 'll see you soon			1
" skepticism will undoubtedly follow his story as additional facts arise			0
there 's more to tell , he told @entity25 , but " i do n't want to talk anymore			1
another day , when i feel better			0
" @entity324 teen was adrift at sea for 26 days ; mother calls return ' a miracle '			2

the castaway 's companion is identified as @entity160 , 23
" i thought , ' i am going to get out , ' " @entity8 says in an interview with @entity25
he says he considered killing himself when he ran out of food and water
@entity8 says he lived off fish , birds , turtles , rainwater and urine while adrift
