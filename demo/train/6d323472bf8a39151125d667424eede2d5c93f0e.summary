@entity1 , @entity0 -- the @entity4 is prepared for " any contingency " when it comes to dealing with @entity7 , secretary of defense @entity3 told @entity2			1
" we 're within an inch of war almost every day in that part of the world , and we just have to be very careful about what we say and what we do , " @entity3 said wednesday on " @entity8 with @entity9			1
" during a wide - ranging interview at @entity18 headquarters in @entity1 , @entity3 and secretary of state @entity19 talked about @entity20 , the @entity21 and @entity7			1
the two were in @entity0 for meetings to prepare for a @entity18 summit in @entity25 next month			2
@entity3 's assessment of @entity7 followed last week 's launch by @entity28 of a long - range rocket			1
despite the failure of the launch -- with the rocket breaking apart 81 seconds after liftoff , it drew condemnation from the @entity4 and countries in the region			2
when asked whether the threat posed by @entity7 kept him awake at night , @entity3 said : " unfortunately these days , there 's a hell of a lot that keeps me awake			1
but that 's one that tops the list			0
" since the failed rocket launch , there has been speculation that @entity7 would carry out a nuclear test -- something it did before following a failed rocket launch			1
@entity3 said a nuclear test would be considered a provocation and " worsen our relationship , " though he refused to discuss specific action the @entity4 would take in response			1
international leaders had urged @entity7 to cancel the launch , but @entity28 refused to back down , insisting the operation is for peaceful purposes			1
@entity7 said the rocket was designed to carry an observation satellite , though the @entity4 , @entity62 and @entity63 said it was a cover for a long - range ballistic missile test			1
the use of ballistic missile technology is a violation of @entity69			0
@entity70 , the grandson of @entity71 , became the new head of the secretive regime in december , following the death of his father , @entity75			1
the leadership transition has added to uncertainties about @entity28 's intentions			0
" we really are waiting and watching to see whether he can be the kind of leader the @entity7 people need			2
if he just follows in the footsteps of his father , we do n't expect much other than the kind of provocative behavior and the deep failure of the political and economic elite to take care of their own people , " @entity83 said			1
@entity83 said it was too early to determine if there was a prospect for a shift in relations on the @entity100 with the younger @entity71 , who lived outside of @entity7 for a time			1
" we believe that he may have some hope that the conditions in @entity7 can change			2
but again , we 'll watch and wait , " @entity83 said			2
" he gave a speech the other day that was analyzed as being some of the same old stuff and some possible new approach			0
" as a result of the launch , the @entity4 has suspended an agreement reached in february to provide food aid to @entity7			1
@entity7 has been plagued by famine for years and unable to feed its 25 million people			2
the country lost a million people to famine in the 1990s			0
a report last year by aid agencies , who were invited to @entity7 , found that the food shortage was so severe that @entity7 were being forced to forage for wild grasses and herbs			2
" the @entity4 , as you know , was willing to try to reach out to him , which we did , " @entity83 said			1
" we had several high - level meetings			0
we agreed to provide some food aid in return for their ending some of their uranium enrichment and missile development , and they do what has been already termed by @entity3 ( @entity136 ) and the rest of the world as a provocative action			1
" it 's hard for us to tell right now , is this the way it will be with this new leader or does he feel like he has to earn his own credibility in order to have a new path for @entity7 ? " @entity7 had drawn world attention with the announcement of the launch , which came during a two - day nuclear summit in @entity62 that brought together leaders from the @entity4 , @entity152 , @entity153 and dozens			1
the launch also coincided with celebrations surrounding the 100th anniversary of the birth of its late founding leader , @entity71			0
the regime had invited international journalists and space experts to view the launch pad and the satellite , and called the effort " an inspiring deed and an event of historic significance			0
" the last time @entity28 carried out what it described as a satellite launch , in april 2009 , the @entity69 condemned the action and demanded that it not be repeated			0
when asked about recent comments made by @entity173 presidential hopeful @entity172 who said @entity7 's rocket launch highlights the " incompetence " of the @entity177 administration , @entity3 said : " it 's pretty clear that this administration took a firm stand			1
" " the fact is it was provocative , and we have made it very clear to them they should not taken any additional , provocative actions , " @entity3 said			2
" i think that was a clear , strong message that not only our country , but the world sent to @entity7			2
that 's the way , frankly , that @entity4 ought to behave			2
" on the unrest in @entity20 , @entity83 said it was a " long shot " that @entity152 and @entity153 would change their position and allow for a @entity69 resolution that calls for an end to the violence and a transition of power			0
@entity152 and @entity153 have previously vetoed resolutions condemning the violence in @entity20			0
" there does n't seem to be any willingness on their part to go further than where we are right now			0
but this is a fast - changing situation , " @entity83 said			0
there are a number of countries concerned about what will happen if @entity20 descends into a civil war or cause a regional conflict , she said			0
" i do n't think we 're half way through this story yet , " @entity83 said			0
on the alleged misconduct involving prostitutes by @entity21 agents and military personnel in @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity3 called allegations " disturbing			0
" " the reason it was disturbing is that whether it takes place in @entity230 or any other country or in the @entity4 , expect that our people behave according to the highest standards of conduct , " @entity3 said			1
" that obviously did n't happen here			0
as a result we 're investigating the matter , and as a result of that investigation we 'll hold these people accountable			0
" @entity2 's @entity241 contributed to this report .			0
