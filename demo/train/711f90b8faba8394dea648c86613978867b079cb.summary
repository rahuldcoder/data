@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's prime minister wants the @entity6 military to hand over " @entity7 " and two other convicted officials from @entity10 's regime for execution , an @entity1 official said tuesday , but the move could widen the divide between @entity1 's @entity15 communities			1
@entity7 , aka " @entity7 , " was sentenced to death in june for his role in the 1988 @entity19 campaign			1
@entity7 ( aka " @entity7 " ) , @entity20 and @entity21 were sentenced to death in june for their roles in the 1988 @entity19 campaign , an @entity1 army operation in @entity26 - dominated northern @entity1 that killed tens of thousands of people			1
the three were to be executed in october , 30 days after their appeals were exhausted , but the three members of @entity1 's presidency council have not signed the execution orders , as @entity1 law requires			1
many @entity34 and @entity6 officials do n't think @entity20 and @entity21 should be executed because such a move could anger @entity34			1
only recently have @entity6 efforts to bring @entity34 into the @entity1 political fold paid off			2
after the toppling of @entity10 's @entity15 - dominated government and the emergence of the @entity43 - dominated power structure , @entity34 began supporting the insurgency			1
the @entity6 since has made it a political priority to include @entity34 in the @entity1 power structure			2
at the same time , @entity1 's @entity43 might be angry if the three men are n't executed			1
shiites were persecuted under @entity10 , and they want to punish convicted members of the former regime			2
prime minister @entity54 wrote a letter to president @entity56 last week asking him to order the military to hand over the three men , but it was unclear if @entity56 replied , the official in @entity54 's office said			1
though the @entity60 sentenced the men to death in june , the three remain in @entity6 custody			1
the delay in their executions has been attributed to legal and procedural issues			1
@entity6 officials said the men will be handed over when those issues are resolved			1
on sunday , @entity6 deputy secretary of state @entity69 told reporters in @entity0 that there are disagreements on what to do about the situation			2
" once the government of @entity1 has reached a consensus on what they wish to do about these detainees , we will then take action , but at the moment the government of @entity1 itself has not reached its own consensus as to what to do about this situation			0
so we await that , " @entity69 said			1
@entity1 law requires the three members of @entity1 's presidency council sign the execution warrants , but the law does n't explain what happens if leaders do n't sign the warrants			1
@entity95 , the @entity26 president , and @entity97 , the @entity15 vice president , are unwilling to sign an execution order			0
the third member of the council is the @entity43 vice president , @entity99			2
a @entity102 official close to the case said last month that @entity1 courts have not addressed whether the council 's inaction constitutes a de facto pardon or a stay of execution , but @entity54 has said the ruling was upheld by an appellate court and should be carried out regardless of the signatures			1
@entity54 's letter to @entity56 and public statements by the prime minister and others misrepresent " the @entity1 law applicable in this particular case as well as with respect to the procedure governing executions more generally , " the official said			1
@entity1 legal advisers have informed the government of their " unambiguous opinions " regarding the law and executing the three men without approval of the presidency council " would violate @entity1 law and , arguably , international law binding upon individual @entity1 officials , " the official said			1
the @entity102 official further said @entity21 was not " criminally culpable for anything that happened during @entity19 " and that @entity20 and is " extremely popular " among military officials			1
@entity20 's constituency " cuts across @entity140 lines , " the official said			1
" at the end of the day , what i think that we shall see is a compromise : the life of @entity7 will be traded for the savings of the lives " of @entity20 and @entity21 , the @entity102 official said			1
other developments a man appearing in a video shown by an arabic - language tv network tuesday is believed to be one of five @entity155 kidnapped in @entity0 this year , said a @entity157 - based security firm that employs the man			0
