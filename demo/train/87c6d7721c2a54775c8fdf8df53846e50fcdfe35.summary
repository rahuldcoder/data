-- it had all the elements of a soap opera			0
now the trial of former @entity9 gov. @entity8 and his wife has gone to the jury after more than a month of sometimes soul - baring testimony on whether they improperly accepted gifts from a businessman while in office in exchange for promoting his company			1

the gifts included designer clothes , a @entity53 watch , golf clubs , iphones and a painting , according to the indictment and evidence presented at the trial			2
their defense ? the 38 - year marriage was so broken that the @entity62 barely spoke to each other , let alone conspired to peddle influence in the way alleged by the government			1
@entity8 said he did n't commit any crime , though he acknowledged questionable judgment in accepting what he called the " personal generosity and friendship " of @entity43			0
