when you pass @entity3 in the halls of @entity6 's commanding campus , he glances up , smiles and carries on doing what he has done for the past 20 years : cleaning			0
keeping the dormitories and lecture halls spotless for @entity13 students has been his livelihood since @entity3 moved to the @entity15 as a young man			0
he works two jobs to support his family : janitor by day , taxi driver by night			0
but it 's what he 's done thousands of miles away that will amaze you most			0
there is a part of all of us that hangs on to where we are from , that wants to help those we leave behind			0
for @entity3 , that desire consumes him			0
though he lives in @entity34 , his heart and mind are never far from @entity35 , where he was born			1
in november we traveled to @entity35 , the poorest country in the @entity37 , with @entity38			1
we were on a journey to his hometown of @entity42 , a tiny village in the mountains to the south of the island nation			1
we wanted to see for ourselves what @entity38 had accomplished -- what had become the subject of a documentary named " @entity42			1
" after seemingly endless hours driving on the worst roads we 'd ever seen , we pulled up to the top of a hill and parked next to a huge cement block			0
that hollow , gigantic block held something priceless for the people of @entity58 : clean water			1
it 's priceless because @entity61 estimates 768 million people around the world still use unsafe drinking water sources			2
every minute , a child somewhere in the world dies of a water - related disease , according to @entity68			2
the @entity69 says about 1.6 million people die of diarrheal diseases every year from a lack of access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation			2
" when i touch the water , the reservoir , i feel i touch my heart ... my own blood , " @entity3 told us			2
the story of how the water came to @entity42 is a tale of triumph over all odds and of one man 's decades - long determination			1
as a young boy growing up in @entity42 , @entity3 and his brother @entity89 would make the treacherous three - hour climb up and down the side of a mountain to reach a spring			1
it was the only way they could get clean water for their family			1
they watched as their fellow villagers got sick from drinking contaminated water from the river below or injured themselves climbing the mountain trying to do the same			2
when they were children , @entity3 and @entity89 vowed to build a pipeline to bring that clean water down to the village , but the money was far too hard to come by			1
the 2010 @entity35 earthquake made the situation even worse			1
@entity3 watched the news about the @entity35 earthquake from his home in @entity111 , @entity34 , where he had moved in 1989			1
in the days to come he would learn 11 of his relatives had died in the earthquake			2
his daughter was visiting family in @entity35 when it hit			1
she was one of the lucky ones			0
for @entity3 , the earthquake was a breaking point			2
but as a single father of four -- working two jobs to get by -- he felt helpless			0
then his mind turned to water and the dream he 'd had with his brother 40 years ago			2
over the following months , @entity3 raised $ 38,000 with students at @entity6 to build the pipeline that would bring clean water to @entity42			1
raising the money was only the beginning			0
building the pipeline would prove immensely challenging and take the strength of the entire village to accomplish			2
yet eventually , it came to be			0
" do you feel proud ? " we ask @entity3 after seeing all he has done for his village			2
" i 'm proud for the people there but not proud for myself , " he said			0
the people of @entity42 are the ones , he says , that drive him to be better -- to do better			1
he feels like he has n't done enough			0
exactly five years since that devastating 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck and claimed more than 230,000 lives , the work in @entity35 still to be done remains daunting			1
roads are in shambles ; some neighborhoods in the capital of @entity149 remain flattened ; families mourn their loved ones lost			0
but there is a light that shines from @entity42 -- the light of one man 's power to unite his village and lift them higher			1
he had a dream and made that dream a reality			0
now that he 's brought water to @entity42 , he is working with a local charity to build a school in the village			1
next , he hopes to build a clinic			0
eighty percent of @entity35 's population lives below the poverty line			1
ask @entity38 where he gets the drive to work tirelessly for his people -- even living thousands of miles away -- and he replies : " because i know exactly the way they suffer			0
" it 's clear he has no idea how much he has eased their suffering , and in a way , given them a gift greater than water			2
" the government can not do everything , " @entity3 says emphatically as we walk through @entity42 , dodging the rain under the canopy of trees			1
" the @entity35 ... population needs to take the responsibility			1
everybody , you know , can help , can put hands together , all of us			0
because this is our country			0
" as he wraps up another janitorial shift on @entity6 's campus and clocks out in the bitter cold of a january afternoon , @entity3 leaves us with this : " if i can work another two jobs again to change the community and the life of the kids for the next generation , i will			0
i will do it with happiness			0
