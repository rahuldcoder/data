on the southern fringes of @entity5 , in the shadow of a huge steel plant , a cacophony of barking overwhelms the dull thud of artillery fire			1
the @entity9 animal shelter is crammed with almost 1,000 dogs of all sizes , ages and breeds ( though the number that can claim any sort of pedigree is probably in single figures )			1
many are orphans of the conflict that has shaken this city for the past six months			1
their owners have left or in a few cases been killed by the shelling			2
some have been discovered tied up and emaciated ; others carry the scars of shrapnel or hobble around on three legs			0
there are several in every cage , with a handful of straw to protect them from temperatures that plunge far below freezing at night			0
the director of the sanctuary is @entity37 , a tall middle - aged woman with jet black hair , whose compassion for the animals in her care is unstinting			1
she cradles a young dog called @entity43 , the only survivor when a shell hit her family 's home near the airport			2
@entity43 was found traumatized in the ruins and it has taken weeks to gain her trust			0
@entity37 says that the dogs here used to be terrified by the sounds of war			1
now , like the people of @entity5 , they hardly notice them			1
inside the office block , a puppy -- mostly black @entity59 - is recovering from a broken leg and shrapnel wound			2
@entity63 of oatmeal are cooking in the yard			0
it 's like feeding an army			0
a few very lucky dogs are going to new homes in @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 , but the great majority will remain at the shelter so long as there is money to feed them			1
the staff and volunteers at @entity9 are struggling to cope with the sudden influx , but the dogs here are a small fraction of the number now roaming the city , sleeping in bombed - out stores and the ruins of apartment blocks			1
some run in packs , hungry and cold , as the long winter nights set in			1
@entity9 runs a sterilization program , but there are literally thousands of dogs on the streets -- and some residents worry they will turn vicious as they grow more desperate -- as if the people here did n't have enough to worry about already			1
@entity37 says she has enough money to see the shelter through to the end of the year			2
much of the center 's funding comes from one of @entity106 's richest men , @entity104 , a native of @entity5 who has moved to @entity107 after falling out with those running the @entity109 , which is now in firm control of the city			1
not far from the shelter , his foundation is also providing food aid to the city 's neediest people			1
the people -- especially the elderly -- and the animals of @entity5 are in a common struggle to survive			1
old women , their faces creased by decades of endurance and hardship , still find a few scraps for dogs on the streets			2
some share what little food they have with pets			2
but life here is getting tougher by the day : pensioners scrounge up coins worth less than one @entity135 cent in an effort to buy bread ; some of the handful of supermarkets still open have imposed a limit on how many coins they will accept			0
heating , electricity and water supplies are intermittent			0
inflation is accelerating because there are few safe routes in and out of the city and produce is more difficult to transport			2
the @entity150 has distributed food vouchers to some 10,000 internally displaced people in the @entity5 region and aims to reach 120,000 people over the next six months			1
but the @entity106 government estimates that some 450,000 people are displaced			2
and many of those who are not -- who can not flee the fighting -- are in just as much need			0
the @entity106 government has decided to stop paying pensions , state salaries and other benefits in areas held by the separatists			0
some people in @entity5 are traveling to nearby government - held cities like @entity169 to try to register for their pensions , but such trips bring risk and expense			1
the self - declared @entity109 says it is setting up a pension fund , but when and from where the money will come is unknown			0
there is still money in @entity5 , once a relatively prosperous city built on manufacturing and steel			1
but it is concentrated in a few hands			0
most of those who have stayed -- or who came back when the ceasefire was signed in september -- have received no income for months			0
the full extent of the elderly 's plight is laid out on the sidewalks near @entity5 's railway station			1
in temperatures below freezing on saturday morning , a clutch of women -- and a few men -- stood over a few possessions , worth next to nothing , in the forlorn hope that someone would buy something			0
all of them appeared to be at least sixty			0
it was a pathetic scene			0
on offer : clothes hangers , chipped mugs , half - used tubes of medication , a @entity211 song book , a couple of screws and some nails			0
in nearly half an hour , we saw nothing sold			0
and the refrain from the street sellers was the same : " i do n't know how we are going to survive			0

shelter on the outskirts of @entity5 is home to almost 1,000 dogs
animals also run wild in packs through the war - torn city , sparking safety concerns
many dogs have been orphaned or *abandoned* by their owners because of the conflict
the people of @entity5 are struggling to feed themselves , let alone pets , as winter closes in
