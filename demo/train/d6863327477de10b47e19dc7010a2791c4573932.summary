-- underage sex trafficking is an awful thing , on that we can all agree			1
but the growing clamor by individual @entity7 states for the shutdown of @entity10 's web - based advertising site , @entity11 , is panicky , scattershot , legally suspect and potentially just as dangerous			1
@entity11 is a personals website with a special " adult " section containing a wealth of listings for escort services			1
like the back pages of most alternative local news weeklies , or for that matter the @entity23 of the phone book , the website contains ads and pictures that make no pretense about what is being offered			0
these are ads for prostitutes			2
what has particularly upset law enforcement officials and attorneys general , however , is that these listings have been used by underage prostitutes and the pimps selling them			1
some of the listings also come from brothels whose workers are either illegal aliens or trafficked sex slaves			2
while @entity11 has attempted to exercise some level of editorial control over its listings and also cooperates with police investigations into the activities of its posters , many are arguing that the mere existence of such listings promote prostitution , an illegal activity , and child sex slavery , a heinous and intolerable practice			1
most notably , @entity56 wrote a scathing piece in the @entity58 , calling @entity11 a " godsend to pimps , allowing customers to order a girl online as if she were a pizza			2
" he went on to list some examples of young girls trafficked through the site , including one as young as 13			0
@entity10 hit back , questioning his reporting , and he responded in kind defending it			2
as the rhetoric heated up , arguments seemed to focus more on dates of birth and the technicalities of web launches than the crime of child prostitution or how to stop it			0
as usual , the horror of child abuse and mysteriousness of the @entity80 combined to distort rational debate and cloud reality			0
meanwhile , the anonymously run website , " @entity84 , " uses the most sensationalist language it can muster , along with personal attacks and dossiers on @entity10 writers and editors who have nothing to do with the parent company , @entity10 's advertising supplement			2
to me , these posts seem much more concerned with lambasting the @entity10 newspaper for its pro-gay and " immoral " stances than its ownership by the same media company that owns @entity11			1
in a sense , the girls and young women affected are being pimped yet again travel : fighting sex trafficking in hotels , one room at a time this is the environment in which @entity108 wrote its well - meaning but ultimately ill - informed law @entity109 , making it a felony to publish " any advertisement for a commercial sex act , which is to take place in the state of @entity108 and that includes the depiction of a minor			1
" ever since @entity118 closed its " adult " section , @entity11 had become the go - to online spot for sex listings			1
its presence grew to be ubiquitous across the @entity7 , making it the target of numerous law enforcement and attorneys general			0
like the other states hoping to curtail the practice of underage prostitution and sex slavery , @entity108 believes that the websites listing escort services should be held accountable for the listings on their pages			1
the problem is it 's awfully hard to tell whether a person posting an ad for a 21 - year - old escort is telling the truth			0
as written , @entity108 's law applies whether or not the person or business knew that minors were to be involved			0
so if someone were to post a comment to the article you are now reading that included a hint of how or where to find illegal sex with a minor , @entity0 would be feloniously liable			0
the @entity152 , passed in 1996 , was written to prevent just such blanket liability traps from hindering normal communication on the @entity80			0
@entity155 determined that a free and open @entity80 required that the host of a site not be responsible for " third - party generated content			1
" @entity155 also realized -- as the @entity10 has argued -- that the @entity80 actually makes it a whole lot easier to catch predators and sex traffickers			1
unlike underground or street prostitution , this activity occurs out on the open web and is highly traceable by ip addresses and other means			0
ultimately , ending sex trafficking of minors is just not the best basis for developing good @entity80 policy			0
it is outlier behavior , and the very mention of its existence ends up paralyzing more rational debate and legislative specificity			0
in this case , it becomes an excuse to pile on a @entity184 - based , gay - friendly , left - leaning publication with a fine history of investigative journalism			0
meanwhile , @entity10 may be correct in challenging a law that paralyzes the @entity80 , but its inability to find a business model that does n't depend on the adult sex industry is its own fault			1
@entity118 voluntarily removed its own " adult " section when the arguments for maintaining it just became untenable			0
@entity10 was the beneficiary of all that adult content , and is now the bearer of the karma			1
this sort of content is not just unbecoming of an editorial group that prides itself on promoting ethics and social justice ; it is hypocritical			0
like any alternative newspaper , the @entity10 can argue that an underserved subculture -- the sex industry -- deserves a forum through which to take care of its business in the safest , most traceable and transparent way possible			2
but the listings on @entity11 do n't reflect such priorities , nor do they reflect well on the integrity of the company that is hosting them			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity220 .			2

@entity220 : calls to close @entity11 are scattershot , potentially dangerous
he says *authorities* say ads there peddle underage prostitutes , which is heinous
he says *federal* law does n't hold sites responsible for third - party generated content
@entity220 : @entity10 may be right to resist challenge but should ditch sex listings
