-- officially billed as @entity1 , @entity2 , the festival that came to be known , simply , as @entity2 is the stuff of legend			1
friday marks the 45th anniversary of @entity2 , which took place from august 15 - 18 , 1969			1
@entity2 did n't take place in @entity2 , @entity9 , but in @entity10 , about 60 miles away			1
" it was really called @entity2 because ( festival co-creator ) @entity12 thought it had the right vibe , " @entity15 , journalist and author of " @entity17 in @entity18 : the creation of the @entity2 , 1969 " told @entity0			1
" @entity2 was where @entity20 lived , " said @entity15 , " it 's where @entity23 hung out and he just liked the whole feel of the word			1
no matter where they were gon na have it , it was always going to be the @entity2			1
everything about @entity2 has to do with the vibe			1
" 2009 : folk singer @entity33 remembers @entity2 @entity34 provided @entity2 's venue by leasing out his 600 - acre dairy farm near the hamlet of @entity38 in the @entity40 community of @entity10 , @entity9 , 100 miles north of @entity41			1
the posters promised " @entity43 , " but the festival 's initial concept " depends on who you talk to , " said @entity15			1
@entity12 and festival promoter @entity48 wanted to have a blowout that was " the biggest party the counterculture had ever seen , " said @entity15			1
" if you talk to their partners , @entity57 and @entity58 , who were the money guys , it was to make a lot of money			1
" for the crowd of 350,000 to 450,000 young people in attendance , @entity2 was all about peace and love , and that 's no myth			1
" the entire woodstock festival was peaceful and the kids were respectful because of one word : marijuana , " said @entity15			2
if it had been other drugs it would 've been chaos			2
but because of dope and @entity78 , everything was peaceful there for those three days			2
" @entity81 organizers who had been expecting a crowd of 80,000 to 100,000 people were blindsided when quadruple the crowd showed up			2
no one was prepared for a surplus of 300,000 people			2
with no system in place to charge them , @entity2 became a free event			1
cars within a five - mile radius were at a standstill			2
@entity9 gov. @entity95 declared a state of emergency in @entity38			2
by @entity2 's second day , authorities publicly pleaded for anyone who might be on their way to the festival to turn around and go home			1
eventually no one could get out or in unless they needed to be airlifted			2
festival managers scrambled to fly in 30 extra physicians from @entity106			2
@entity108 vocalist @entity107 spoke to @entity0 while promoting the blu - ray release of the director 's cut of the 1970 @entity112 - winning documentary " @entity113			2
" @entity107 recalled arriving with the other members of @entity108 via helicopter			2
" we flew in because everybody parked on the highway , " said @entity107			2
" it was kinda like ' @entity121 ' or ' @entity122 , ' you know ? ' if you build it , they will come			0
' the highways were closed			0
@entity127 was like a parking lot			0
so we had to fly in on helicopters			0
" @entity108 's appearance is considered one of the festival highlights			0
the band played early on , before the first of two downpours that reduced @entity34 's alfalfa field to a sloppy , slippery slew of mud puddles			0
all of @entity108 's music was new at the time and the band was virtually unknown			0
they had not yet released their first album			0
@entity2 is credited for jumpstarting @entity108 's career			1
" if you played at @entity2 , you had a career , " said @entity107 , who had no idea that the festival 's legacy would resonate so powerfully 45 years later			1
@entity2 's lineup also included @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 ; @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity23 , among others			1
by the time he began his monday morning set , which included his celebrated rendition of " @entity163 , " the crowd had thinned out to 200,000			0
many had to get to work , school , wanted to get a jump on the traffic or simply could not endure the close quarters any longer			0
even so , @entity158 had never performed in front of such a big group before and nearly bailed			0
although @entity2 has been lifted onto a pedestal in certain ways , by all accounts the festival lived up to the fable			1
the fairy tale , though largely drug - laden , was a reality for those in attendance			0
@entity181 : hazy memories of @entity2 it can be difficult to connect the storybook reality with @entity2 's harsher realities like overflowed toilets , lack of food and water , and a makeshift , 20 - bed hospital tent to accommodate roughly 3,000 medical emergencies			1
a tractor crushed a teenage boy in a sleeping bag , fatally wounding him			0
one young man died of a heroin overdose , another died of a burst appendix			0
a young woman broke her back falling off of stage scaffolding			0
in addition , there were about 400 bad acid trips , sprained ankles from sliding in the mud , and many a gashed foot as a result of stepping barefoot on broken glass			0
two babies were born , too			0
one child arrived in traffic en route to the festival , and the other was delivered in a hospital after the mother was airlifted out of the field			0
a lot of sex was going on at @entity2 and , according to @entity15 , a lot of women forgot to pack their birth control so supplies of birth control pills were flown in			1
for an event where facilities were strained far past capacity , not a single fight or incident of violence erupted among the crowd , which endured near - unbearable conditions			0
town elders , residents , shopkeepers and local police could n't get over how courteous and considerate the kids were -- all 450,000 or so of them			0
@entity2 's financial backers were not so lucky			1
they took a bath -- and not a mud one -- to the tune of $ 1.3 million			0
@entity15 called @entity258 of the ' 60s " because it , along with the moon landing , represented a bright period after the deaths of @entity250 , @entity251 , the rev. @entity252 and @entity253 , and before the breakup of the @entity255 and the deaths of @entity153 , @entity158 and @entity257			0
@entity2 is legendary for many reasons , but what made it magical was the value people placed on one another			1
" if these are the kids that are going to inherit the world , " @entity34 said at the time , " i do n't fear for it			0

the fabled @entity2 took place 45 years *ago* this week
there were *massive* crowds and bands like the @entity273
despite rain and lack of food , water and working toilets , it really was " @entity43 "
