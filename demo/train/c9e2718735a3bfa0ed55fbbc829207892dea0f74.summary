-- as the toll of international sanctions on @entity2 continues to mount , @entity2 's new president @entity1 has signaled his government 's interest in addressing the world 's concerns over his nation 's nuclear program , and easing the pain on the @entity2 economy			1
@entity1 's recent statements , tweets and appointments have underscored a possible willingness to resolve the nuclear problem			1
he told @entity18 wednesday that @entity2 will never develop nuclear weapons			2
at the @entity20 meeting in @entity21 next week , @entity1 is expected to affirm his interest in resolving the issue			1
in another positive step , president @entity24 and @entity1 have exchanged lettersâ € ” the first direct communication at this level between the two countries in many , many years			1
explaining that this does not yet mean there is a breakthrough , president @entity24 indicated that he expects negotiations to be difficult and take time			0
" negotiations with the @entity2 is always difficult , " @entity24 said to @entity35 on sunday			0
" i think this new president is not going to suddenly make it easy			0
" indeed , there is little reason to necessarily believe that everything has suddenly changed for the better			0
after years of intransigence , many wonder whether @entity2 supreme leader @entity44 , who holds overwhelming authority , is ready to make honest concessions			0
furthermore , it 's not yet clear whether @entity2 understands that a mere change in rhetoric wo n't mean automatic sanctions relief			2
in fact , only its concrete actions to resolve the nuclear questions will lead to a meaningful relief of sanctions			1
and when they come , those actions may initially be incremental , negotiated to test the willingness of both sides to take confidence - building actions that will lead to more comprehensive progress			0
the @entity62 should not dismiss @entity2 's rhetoric and its apparent litmus testing as insignificant			1
though a deal will be difficult , as many negotiations are , it 's not impossible to reach an agreement if @entity2 is willing to take the steps necessary			0
that , of course , is still a big " if			0
" it 's no secret among diplomats and experts what a final deal will probably look like : @entity2 will retain a small level of enrichment capability under a very strict regimen of inspections by the @entity80 , which will also have ready access			0
so far , such a deal has never been in reach ; the @entity62 and its diplomatic partners still have a long way to go			2
because of this , some would rather continue to fight for complete @entity2 capitulation and zero ability to conduct nuclear activities of any sort , a result that does not allow the @entity2 regime a chance to " save face			2
" this " all - or - nothing " outcome is simply not realistically attainable by means short of a major military intervention			0
as a result , the @entity62 should be exhausting all diplomatic opportunities to reach an agreement that best preserves its security and the security of the region , while allowing the @entity2 a chance to reach a settlement they can live with			1
@entity107 has an important role in this delicate moment			0
though the @entity62 should remain skeptical of @entity2 intentions , it should not turn down an opportunity that may be presenting itself			1
one of its biggest bargaining chips is the congressional sanctions , the presence of which , at this point , could be misinterpreted as an unwillingness to support a diplomatic solution			1
@entity107 needs to be flexible in its approach and refrain at this time from tacking on additional sanctions or authorizing military force if it is serious about giving diplomacy the room it needs to operate and not missing a possible opening			1
ultimately , it wo n't be easy to resolve a decade 's worth of issues over @entity2 's drive for a nuclear capability			2
but there is also no better time to put the @entity2 to the test and see if they are truly willing to play ball and match their actions to their rhetoric on the diplomatic scene			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity142 and @entity143 .			0

@entity145 , @entity143 : @entity2 president @entity1 shows signs of wanting to resolve nuke issue

they say @entity2 , @entity62 both testing . @entity62 will want concrete actions before easing sanctions
