after all , he is the @entity1			0
i do n't mean to be disrespectful , but as i watched the trailer for the new movie , " @entity1 , " i found myself gawking at the actor portraying @entity0			1
@entity6 is one hot dude			1
his @entity0 looks more like @entity7 than that nice man with the beard in all those paintings			1
i 'm not the only one gawking at @entity11 's @entity0			1
he inspired the hashtag , " @entity13 "			1
it went viral on @entity15			0
the actor told the @entity18 he does n't want his looks to distract from the movie , but , " if the message of @entity0 was love , hope and compassion , and i can bring that to more people by being a more appealing @entity0 , i am happy with that			1
" clearly we have a new trend			0
a " more appealing " @entity0 is not just a better prophet , he 's ... sexy			1
we actually do n't know what @entity0 looked like			1
we do know he was a carpenter , so perhaps @entity0 was buff			1
but , i do n't think when the @entity30 asked , " @entity31 ! can anything good come from there ? " and @entity37 answered , " come and see , " they were talking about @entity0 ' beautiful face or chiseled abs. yes , @entity0 , as portrayed in countless paintings , has a six - pack			1
as comedian and author , @entity41 joked , " i 'd like to get ripped ... ripped like @entity0			1
you 've seen the pictures , right ? he 's ripped ! ripped			2
he 's the son of @entity44			2
he 's not going to be walking around saying i 've got back fat today , i 'm so puffy			1
" all joking aside , why must @entity0 be sexy ? @entity46 ripped ? or even handsome ? the rev. @entity47 , @entity48 , a @entity49 priest and former president of @entity51 , says , " there is absolutely no indication that @entity0 was good - looking and sexy			1
in fact there is a passage in the prophet @entity57 that is taken as referring to @entity0			1
it says this : " he had no form or majesty that we should look at him / nothing in his appearance that we should desire him			0
he was despised and rejected by others ; a man of suffering and acquainted with infirmity ; and as one from whom others hide their faces he was despised , and we held him of no account			0
) while this might not be conclusive evidence , it 's quite possible that @entity0 was no @entity76 @entity7 from @entity77			1
on the other hand , why would n't @entity44 create a perfect son ? " anything that is sexy is going to attract people			0
people who might not go to the movie might want to check it out , particularly non-christians , " says the rev. @entity82 , senior pastor of @entity84 's @entity83 in @entity85			2
" i do n't see a problem with @entity0 being attractive given our cultural context , " she says			1
" i do n't recall a @entity0 who was not appealing to the eye			1
" @entity82 is more concerned about what she considers an inaccurate portrayal of @entity0 ' ethnicity			2
the rev. @entity99 , sj , editor - at - large for @entity101 , and author of the coming book , " @entity0 : a pilgrimage , " agrees			2
" @entity44 did not choose to incarnate himself in @entity105 , " he says			0
" he chose to incarnate himself at a certain place , at a certain time in a certain person			0
" and that person was a @entity111 jew			0
" many people have a hard time with the humanity of @entity0 ... the closer he is to human physical perfection , the easier it is for some to accept him			1
" but , @entity99 says , there is a danger in that too			0
a physically perfect @entity0 makes him into a @entity44 pretending to be man			2
when @entity0 was both human and divine			2
" he was like us in all things , except sin , as the theology goes , " @entity99 says			0
" that means , he had a body , he got sick , he got tired , he may have sprained an ankle or two			0
there are passages in the @entity130 showing him falling asleep because he was tired			0
we tend to airbrush the physical imperfections away			0
" those traits make @entity0 so much more accessible			2
so much more ... human			0
i tried to come up with a living person to compare to @entity0			2
that , of course , is impossible			0
the closest i can come , as a @entity139 , is @entity140			0
i 've grown to revere him			0
is it because he 's sexy ? in a word : no.			0

a film *starring* @entity6 as @entity0 opens this week
@entity148 says he inspired the hashtag " @entity13 "
@entity148 : is physical attractiveness necessary for a *religious* figure in today 's culture ?
