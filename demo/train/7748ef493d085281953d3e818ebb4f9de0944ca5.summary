some crew members helped passengers and then jumped overboard , passengers said ; remaining crew members seemed helpless to handle the melee			0
the case centers on several questions , including why it allegedly took @entity23 more than an hour to issue an order to abandon ship and why he allegedly left the vessel before all passengers had abandoned it			2

the prosecutor presented the court with a list of 357 witnesses wednesday			2

the first hearing , devoted to preliminary questions , was held in a theater to accommodate the dozen of lawyers involved			0
' i want justice ' among the civil plaintiffs is @entity116 , who came to @entity19 for the opening hearing of the trial			1
" i 'm still so angry and i want justice , this is why i 'm here , " he told @entity119 outside court			1
" it was all going well , it was the nicest holiday we ever had with the family , " he said , remembering the hours before the 114,000 - ton ship hit the rocks just before 10 p.m. on a winter 's night			0
@entity116 recalls getting into a lifeboat with his wife and the two girls , then ages 3 and 4			0
but the lifeboat was stuck , so the family had to climb out and struggle to the opposite site of the sliding vessel			0
there , they had to slip into the sea using a rope ladder , with no life jackets and holding the children in their arms			0
" i thought ' we 'll all die , ' it was all dark and cold , " he said			0
" i still have unjustified panic moments , even this morning during the hearing , i suddenly thought that an earthquake was coming			0

" we want this sentence to be an example , to serve as monitor so that similar accident never happen again , " he said			0
the civil plaintiffs also include the @entity45 cruise line , which is suing @entity23 for causing the accident and destroying its ship			1
however , many of the civil parties and @entity23 's own lawyers argue that @entity45 and its parent company , @entity166 , should be considered as criminal defendants in the trial			1
@entity50 safety after the @entity4 ' this is not a car accident ' they suggest that responsibility for the handling of the situation after the shipwreck , including any delay in the order to abandon ship , should extend beyond the captain			1

" this is not a car accident			0
i 'm very disappointed that @entity23 is the only defendant , " @entity10 , a @entity188 dancer who was on the bridge the night of the shipwreck and is a civil plaintiff in the case , told @entity119 outside the court			1
evidence presented to the court is likely to include conversations between @entity23 and cruise line emergency officials on the night of the accident			1
the 32 deaths occurred during the abandonment of the ship rather than in its impact with the rocks			1
meanwhile , the @entity4 lies half - submerged on its side on the shore of @entity73 , rusting and rotting in the waters off @entity206 's coast			2
nearly 500 workers are involved in an operation led by @entity209 to remove the wreck while protecting the marine environment			0
@entity209 and @entity45 said last week they hope to be able to rotate the vessel to a vertical position in september			0
they will then be able to assess whether it can be refloated and towed away			0
