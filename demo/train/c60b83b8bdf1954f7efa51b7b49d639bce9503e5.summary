@entity7 ' story began on july 3 , 2008 , when she was nine months pregnant and driving home with her other children from a doctor 's appointment in @entity43 , @entity10			1
a police officer pulled her over and , according to @entity7 ' complaint , decided to arrest her for driving without a license because the officer suspected she was in the country illegally			2
