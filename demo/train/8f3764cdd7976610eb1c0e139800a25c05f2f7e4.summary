@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 and his deputy @entity6 are believed to be hiding close to each other in houses in northwest @entity9 , but are not together , a senior @entity4 official said			1
" nobody in @entity14 is living in a cave , " said the official , who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the intelligence matters involved			1
rather , @entity14 's top leadership is believed to be living in relative comfort , protected by locals and some members of the @entity9 intelligence services , the official said			1
@entity9 has repeatedly denied protecting members of the @entity14 leadership			1
the official said the general region where @entity5 is likely to have moved around in recent years ranges from the mountainous @entity27 area in the far northwest near the @entity29 border , to the @entity30 , which adjoins @entity1 's @entity31 , one of the @entity34 strongholds during the @entity36 invasion in 2001			1
@entity31 is also the region from which @entity5 is believed to have escaped during a @entity36 bombing raid in late 2001			1
@entity36 officials have long said there have been no confirmed sightings of @entity5 or @entity6 for several years			1
the area that the official described covers hundreds of square miles of some of the most rugged terrain in @entity9 , inhabited by fiercely independent tribes			1
the official also confirmed the @entity36 assessment that @entity50 , the leader of the @entity34 , has moved between the cities of @entity52 and @entity53 in @entity9 over the last several months			1
the official would not discuss how the coalition has come to know any of this information , but he has access to some of the most sensitive information in the @entity4 alliance			2
analysis : the finger is being pointed at @entity9 however , @entity63 , the @entity36 special envoy to @entity9 and @entity1 , said there was nothing new to what the official was saying			1
" we hardly have a day that goes by where somebody does n't say they know where @entity5 is , " said @entity63 , who was in @entity68 , @entity69 , for a conference on @entity1			1
another @entity36 official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said the exact locations for @entity5 and @entity80 are unknown , other than that they are " somewhere in the tribal areas of @entity9 near the @entity1 border			1
" " if we knew where he was -- in a house , an apartment , a villa or an underground cave or bunker -- we would have gotten him , " said the official			1
" we ca n't rule out he may be in a cave one day and a house in a city on another			2
" the official referred to cia director @entity97 's comment a few months ago that the @entity36 has not had any precise information about @entity5 's whereabouts for many years			1
" he is , as is obvious , in very deep hiding , " @entity97 said			0
" he 's in an area of the tribal areas of @entity9 that is very difficult			1
" as for @entity9 's role , @entity63 said it was ultimately up to @entity104 to decide how to craft its fight against militants			2
" the @entity36 and our allies -- all would encourage them to do as much as they are able to do , " @entity63 said			1
" there 's been a long discussion about whether ... they would go into other parts of the border area			2
that is for them to decide on the basis of their resources			0
" @entity9 's interior minister @entity121 said monday that similar reports of @entity5 and @entity50 's whereabouts have proven false in the past			1
@entity121 denied the two men are on @entity9 soil , but said that any information to the contrary should be shared with @entity9 officials so that they can take " immediate action " to arrest the pair			0
the @entity4 official , who has day - to - day senior responsibilities for the war , offered a potentially grimmer view than what has been publicly offered by others			2
" every year the insurgency can generate more and more manpower , " despite coalition military attacks , he said			0
although there has been security progress in areas where coalition forces are stationed , he said in other areas , " we do n't know what 's going on			2
" he pointed to an internal assessment that there are 500,000 to 1 million " disaffected " men between the ages of 15 and 25 in the @entity1 - @entity9 border region			0
most are @entity153 , and they make up some of the 95 percent of the insurgency who carry out attacks just to earn money , rather than to fight for a hard - core @entity34 ideology , he said			0
the official said it is now absolutely vital for the @entity1 government to address the needs of this group with security , economic development and jobs in order for the war to end and for @entity1 to succeed			0
" we are running out of time , " he said			0
in recent days , gen. @entity172 , the top @entity36 commander in @entity1 , has made a number of public statements expressing some optimism about the progress of the war			2
@entity172 " does n't think time is running out , " his spokesman , rear adm. @entity178 , told @entity2			0
the @entity4 official said the entire scenario is made more complex by the fact that " there is a huge criminal enterprise " in @entity1 , dealing in human , drug and mineral trafficking			0
those crimes are also tied in to the insurgency			0
he acknowledged the overall strategy now is to increase offensive airstrikes and ground attacks in order to increase the pressure on the @entity34 and insurgent groups to come to the negotiating table with the current @entity1 government			0
there is a growing sense that many insurgent leaders may be willing to accept conditions such as renouncing @entity14 because they want to come back to @entity1			2
but , the official cautioned , hard - core @entity34 groups such as the @entity204 run by @entity50 , the @entity206 , the @entity207 ( @entity207 ) and the @entity9 @entity34 still could potentially muster as many as 30,000 fighters			0
the @entity36 continues to face a more localized insurgency in the south			2
in places like @entity212 and the @entity213 , the majority of the fighters captured are within a few miles of their homes			0
the insurgent leader @entity219 has increased his strength in the south , the official said			0
he essentially exerts some levels of control and influence both in the greater @entity225 region and across the south from @entity227 to @entity228			0
the official continued to stress the urgency of getting the @entity1 government to deal with the multitude of problems it faces			0
right now , the @entity36 war plan approved by president @entity237 extends through 2014 , the official said			1
that is the official document that spells out matters such as troop rotation schedules			0
the @entity36 military could sustain a war " ' indefinitely , " the official said			1
but the goal is to achieve reconciliation and allow the @entity1 government to function and provide security and services to the people			0
without that , he said , " we will be fighting here forever			0
" @entity2 's @entity253 in @entity68 , @entity69 , and @entity254 in @entity255 contributed to this report .			2

" nobody in @entity14 is living in a cave , " official says
the leadership is living in relative comfort , he says
@entity5 likely moved around in an area of rugged terrain
@entity36 special envoy says there 's nothing new to the report
