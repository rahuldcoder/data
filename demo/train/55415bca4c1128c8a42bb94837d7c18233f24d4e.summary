@entity0 , @entity1 -- sixteen - year - old @entity3 is trying to keep spirits up inside the hall that has become home to families fleeing @entity8			1
@entity3 , 16 , said she sometimes feels scared in the @entity0 , @entity1 , shelter			1
she brought two hair weaves with her from @entity11 and is passing the time by styling them and trying to reach friends on her cell phone			2
but she 's struggling even to keep her own nerves at bay			2
" you 're not at home in a place like this			1
you look around , and you do n't know the background of the people looking at you , " she said , adding that she felt a little scared			2
the community center smells , and there are n't enough cots for the 80 or so people seeking shelter there in @entity0 , @entity1 , just across the @entity32 from @entity33			1
@entity3 is one of 18 members of her extended family who piled into a truck borrowed from a friend to get out before the storm hit			1
her cousin @entity39 , 15 , sits on a @entity41 sleeping bag , wrapped in a @entity43 blanket , occasionally reaching out to grab and quiet one of her three nephews			2
she had been trying to read a well - thumbed leather - bound @entity45 but had given up			2
" i do n't have the patience any more			2
" the family is safe , far safer than three years ago , when floodwaters from @entity49 had them trapped in their third - floor apartment for three days			1
ireport.com : your @entity8 stories in 2005 , the family shared a dwindling food supply with neighbors as they waited to be rescued , said 18 - year - old @entity57 , another cousin			1
" we thought everybody was going to die , " he recalled			2
now , @entity61 staff members and volunteers are making sure the evacuees are getting three meals a day and snacks too , but it seems to be only temporary comfort			1
" we 're so far from home ; we have no money ; we have no food			1
the money is running out			1
i 'm not even sure if we have any left , " said @entity72 , @entity39 's sister			0
just getting out of @entity11 took a big bite out of their resources when they stopped at a gas station , the 22 - year - old motel housekeeper said			0
" watching how expensive it got , the more we filled up the tank , i got ta tell you , that scared me			0
" it 's the stories and fears of women like @entity72 -- whose three sons , aged 1 , 2 and 6 , are with her -- that really get to @entity90			1
@entity90 , a registered nurse from @entity91 , had volunteered in the aftermath of @entity49 and booked a flight back to @entity1 as @entity8 approached			1
" it breaks my heart , these little ones			0
their mothers are so stressed out , they 're crying , " @entity90 said			1
" they do n't know if they 're going to be able to put food on their table			1
when they return home , if they have a home to return to			1
" @entity90 has mostly dealt with people crying and having panic attacks			0
" we have learned a lot from @entity49 , but in these shelters , we are going to have chaos			0
" outside , @entity114 , 54 , and his friend @entity115 , 42 , played dominoes with two @entity117 as the winds began howling			0
" here it comes , " @entity114 said , shaking his head			0
" damn , it sounds like something , do n't it ? " @entity114 said he worked in construction as a waterproofer			0
" i wish could stop this water , " the @entity11 native said			0
watching the game , @entity127 also kept one eye on his children as they played hide - and - seek behind two steel water tanks in the old one - room gymnasium			0
they had spent 11 hours on the road , forced to detour through @entity32 to get to @entity33			0
just the cost of gas was bad enough on a welder 's budget , but @entity127 plans to stay in @entity11 no matter how many storms hit			0
" that 's home , " he said			2
but he wonders whether his city has the strength to keep standing			0
" sooner or later , @entity144 is gon na wipe @entity11 off the map for all the murdering and thieving and no - good behavior people have been doing since @entity49 , " he said			0
" that man keeps giving us warnings in the form of hurricanes			0
