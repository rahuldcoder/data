@entity0 -- @entity2 rattles each pill bottle and raps it down on the table , 15 in all			1
" that 's what they had me on right there , every day , " the former sailor says of the prescriptions he received from @entity8 doctors			1
@entity2 , who lives in @entity13 , says his case is an example of how government doctors over-prescribe for active - duty and retired military , with often disastrous results			1
on the other side of the country , the @entity21 family of @entity22 , a decorated @entity23 who died in his sleep from an accidental drug overdose , also says military doctors are writing too many prescriptions			1
" how could a team of doctors , allegedly working together , prescribe all those things together ? " @entity33 asks of the doctors who treated his brother with dozens of separate medications			1
and the military itself is struggling with demands of its personnel returning from multiple warzone deployments and seeking treatment for a variety of injuries and mental issues			1
@entity46 veteran @entity2 blames multiple tours in the @entity48 , on board the @entity50 , for a variety of ailments including post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury			1
but he blames government doctors for loading him up on pills			1
" after i was taking the 10 pills and it was n't working , i went back to the @entity8 , and they prescribed me five more pills on top of everything else , " @entity2 said			1
then came blackouts , and once he tossed furniture out of a friend 's apartment			2
" i 'd thrown it off the balcony , and i had no recollection whatsoever , " @entity2 explained			2
" i called a @entity8 doctor and told her what happened			2
she said , ' oh , it 's too strong			2
just cut the pills in half and take half			2
' i did that , and the next thing i know , i was being arrested by the @entity79 police , " @entity2 said			2
in @entity21 , @entity22 ' brother questions why the successful @entity23 gunnery sergeant had his own oversupply of legally prescribed medicines when he died			1
" they were all legitimately prescribed drugs from physicians who had sat right in front of him and evaluated his condition , and whatever he had an issue of , they would either increase the dosage or the potency of the individual pill , " @entity33 said at his home outside @entity85			2
he shows off the @entity98 battle flag that @entity22 brought back from one of @entity101 's palaces after he fought his way through @entity103			2
he thumbs through photos , including one of the two brothers visiting @entity0			2
and he tells about how his brother was usually the happiest guy around			2
" he laughed and smiled a lot			0
he had a great time			0
he lived life to its fullest			0
he lived life the way people wished they did , " @entity22 says			0
but after multiple deployments to @entity98 and @entity115 and 17 years in the @entity23 , @entity22 was just a shadow			1
he was ghostly , " @entity33 said , describing how he failed to convince his brother that he was n't really fit to serve			0
but @entity22 shipped out again to @entity98 in 2007 , coming back early with stress complaints and suspicions of a traumatic brain injury from a roadside bomb			0
the cover letter on the official military autopsy for @entity22 strongly recommends that family members not read it alone , but with a family friend or minister			1
it spells out the 27 prescriptions found near the body in march 2008 , at @entity131 in @entity132			1
the death was ruled accidental , blamed on " multi-drug toxicity			0
" the list of 27 prescription bottles found at the scene of death takes up most of a page of the autopsy , from topiramate to oxycodone to lorazepam			1
@entity33 admits that the military faces enormous demands , countless requests to ease both the physical and mental pain			0
" you 're gon na give me whatever i need to make me feel better , and you 're gon na make me go away ... because there 's 1,000 people standing in line behind me that just came off the bus with me , " he said			0
the armed services have recognized the problem as a reflection of what also is playing out in civilian life as well			0
" i think in some cases yes , certainly , i think there is over-reliance , " said @entity160			0
gen. @entity163 , the @entity164 's assistant surgeon general			1
" but i think ... it reflects how we are in society ; we do have a tendency to rely on prescription meds			0
" @entity163 says the @entity164 has implemented rules to limit the number of people who can prescribe medications for an individual patient , as well as new scrutiny of cases in which multiple prescriptions have been written			1
new prescriptions may carry a time limit , with no refills without a new examination			1
" we have some new policies that are out to address poly - pharmacy , multiple medications , to make sure we are prescribing these things in a safe and responsible manner to protect the patient , " @entity163 said			1
" ultimately , because we do n't want to leave the responsibility for figuring it out in the hands of the patient			0
" and the military is exploring new treatments , without drugs			0
" whether it be acupuncture or biofeedback or yoga therapy , there is a host of other things we can provide to patients to take care of them right , other than narcotics , " @entity163 said			0
" @entity202 may still have a role , but it does n't have as big a role , and there are alternatives , and that 's the key			0
" meanwhile , @entity33 keeps asking why doctors , commanders and even fellow @entity23 did n't raise the alarm			1
" just to say we gave this trooper a bag of pills , that does n't wash , " he said			0
" it just is n't good enough			0
it just is n't good enough			0
