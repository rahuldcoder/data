the two leaders told reporters after their @entity13 talks that they would continue working together to bring about a resumption of @entity16 peace talks , with @entity2 citing the need to " keep our fingers crossed " for progress			2
in recent months , @entity2 has taken a more active role in trying to bridge the gulf between @entity8 and @entity7 , filling the vacuum created by the removal of @entity26 's president @entity25			1
earlier this month , @entity7 and @entity8 negotiators met in @entity28 with representatives of the @entity30 -- made up of the @entity5 , the @entity31 , the @entity32 and @entity33 -- in an effort to relaunch negotiations after more than a year of deadlock			1

on @entity10 , @entity4 noted that @entity2 was the first leader of an @entity49 state to call on @entity10 president @entity50 to step down over excess brutality against his own people			0
@entity4 thanked the king " for his willingness to stand up , " and for @entity3 's role in @entity57 efforts to encourage a needed peaceful transition in @entity10			2
" unfortunately , we 're continuing to see unacceptable levels of violence inside that country , and so we will continue to consult very closely with @entity3 to create the kind of international pressure and environment that encourages the current @entity10 regime to step aside so that a more democratic process of transition can take place inside of @entity10 , " he said			0
in addition , @entity4 noted what he called the " extraordinary efforts that have been made by his majesty " and @entity3 's prime minister " in guiding political reform in @entity3 , " putting them " ahead of the curve in trying to respond to legitimate concerns both politically and economically			2
" " we have said we want to be as helpful as we can , " @entity4 said of @entity3 reform efforts			0

@entity4 , in his comments , said the @entity5 is providing " timely assistance in areas like food security this week			0
" " as we move into political reform , obviously the economy and the situation that challenges the livelihood of @entity3 is very , very important as we move forward			0
but we are very , very optimistic , " said @entity2			0
outside the @entity13 , however , the @entity94 , a group that says it seeks to promote democracy in the country , protested @entity2 's " absolute monarchy system in @entity3			1
" peace talks between @entity8 and the @entity7 fell apart more than a year ago over disagreements on the issue of @entity8 settlements in the @entity102			0
in september , @entity104 president @entity103 made a bid for the @entity32 to recognize a @entity7 state , a move @entity8 called premature without direct talks to address its long - standing security concerns			1
in november , @entity2 made a rare visit to the @entity7 political capital of @entity112 in the @entity102 , followed by a meeting in @entity28 a week later with @entity8 president @entity114 .			1
