-- poachers threaten to drive the majestic @entity3 elephant to the brink of extinction , just as they have the long - persecuted northern white rhino			1
but poachers are n't the only culprits			0
very wealthy hunters , mainly from the @entity10 , are picking off elephants in their zeal to bag the biggest tusks and trophies and rise within the ranks of the global trophy hunting fraternity			1
there 's reason to believe that , as a result of meaningful actions taken by @entity3 governments as well as the @entity10 government to restrain trophy hunters , this intentional killing may subside			1
two @entity3 countries , @entity26 and @entity27 , have just outlawed trophy hunting			1
and the @entity29 has temporarily stopped issuing permits for hunters to bring home their elephant trophies from @entity34 and @entity35 , where hunting is legal and poorly regulated			2
@entity37 , the corrupt strongman of @entity35 , has allowed so many natural resources within his country to be looted that it makes perfect sense that he can not be trusted to provide safeguards for the elephants of his country			0
in 2012 , the most recent year for which data are available , hunters received permits to import 204 elephant trophies from @entity35 and 36 from @entity34			2
another 261 elephants were shot and killed in @entity26			0
now , thanks to the @entity10 import ban and the hunting prohibitions in the two @entity3 nations , 500 elephants are likely to live this year -- since hunters wo n't kill them if they ca n't bring back the parts			1
unfortunately , hunters can still import trophies from elephants killed in @entity62 and @entity63 , an inexcusable gap in the regulatory efforts to curb the ivory trade			2
it 's time that all @entity3 nations with elephants join @entity26 , @entity70 and @entity27 in barring trophy hunting			1
elephants are much more valuable to the economies of @entity3 nations alive than dead			1
an elephant can be watched throughout his lifetime , and there 's an enormous and growing pool of ecotourism customers waiting for that thrilling experience			0
on the other hand , the creature targeted by the hunter dies after a single bullet tears up his insides , meaning the revenue gained is merely a one shot deal			0
what 's more , the pool of people who want to kill elephants for fun is tiny and declining			2
the pictures and the memories for the ecotourists will last a lifetime , and it 's a trip they 'll never be ashamed to recount to their grandkids			0
photos : tourist trophy hunters chase @entity3 wildlife @entity105 , the lobbying arm of the trophy - hunting crowd , seeks to rationalize such actions by saying that the money derived from such hunts will help animals on the ground , in part by stimulating the flow of money into local communities in their range states and helping to fund conservation efforts			1
but that twisted logic -- kill them to save them -- does not fit with 21st century reality			0
if @entity10 trophy hunters were sincere , they could invest their wealth directly to fight illegal killing			1
anti-poaching teams on the ground need help because poachers , often associated with terrorist groups , slaughtered an estimated 22,000 african elephants last year to sell trinkets in the global marketplace			0
that number is unsustainable , and wild elephants are plainly in crisis			0
alas , @entity10 trophy hunters are out to kill elephants for the same reason as poachers			1
here is what @entity105 says in its official online record book : " an elephant with really good ivory ( 100 pounds , or 45 kg , per tusk used to be the magic number , though these days 70 pounds , or 32 kg , is considered very good ) is generally considered @entity62 's top hunting trophy			2
trophy quality is determined by the weight and beauty of the tusks			0
" i ask myself : would a poacher put it any differently ? against tremendous pressure from a small cadre of hunters and others who want to trade in ivory , including the folks at @entity105 , the @entity10 has taken strong steps against the trade in ivory goods			2
in february , the @entity166 administration took aim at poachers by further tightening restrictions on this trade within @entity10 's borders			1
after @entity172 , @entity10 is the world 's largest market for ivory products			2
the @entity10 and the rest of the world need to do more -- and quickly			0
at a time when we ask poor @entity3 to stop killing elephants to trade in ivory trinkets , is it too much to ask rich @entity10 to stop killing elephants for trade in trophies for display in their homes ? good heavens , is n't this so obvious ? several members of @entity191 are trying to pressure the @entity29 to lift its recently imposed import restrictions on elephant trophies from @entity34 and @entity35			1
the @entity166 administration should reject this lobbying effort			0
@entity196 displays of hunting conquests should n't come by depriving our world of one of the grandest creatures to leave its footprints on the savannahs and in the forests of @entity62 .			0

@entity206 : poachers , as well as wealthy @entity10 hunters , are killing @entity3 elephants
@entity211 : elephants are more valuable to @entity3 nations ' economies alive than dead
he says @entity10 import ban and the hunting prohibitions in two @entity3 nations may help
@entity211 : it 's time that all @entity3 nations with elephants ban trophy hunting
