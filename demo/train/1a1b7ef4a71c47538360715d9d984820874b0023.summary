@entity0 , @entity1 's first democratically elected president , has been ousted from office just over a year into his presidency			1
deposed by the military and reportedly held under house arrest , @entity0 's fall from power has been nothing if not rapid			1
@entity1 's powerful military stepped in july 3 , hours after a deadline the generals had set for @entity0 to order reforms expired			1
the military 's intervention followed days of opposition protests , during which hundreds of thousands of people massed in @entity18 's @entity17 and elsewhere to demand that he step down and call fresh presidential elections , or face a campaign of civil disobedience			2
the news of @entity0 's downfall prompted further mass street demonstrations , with both his opponents and his supporters turning out to celebrate , or protest , his ouster			2
protests turn deadly as deadline looms for @entity0 @entity0 , who is backed by the @entity32 , @entity1 's oldest and best - organized political movement , insists he remains the country 's legitimate leader			1
as the deadline neared , he offered to form an interim coalition government to oversee parliamentary elections and revise the constitution that was enacted in january			0
but @entity1 's top military officer , gen. @entity41 @entity40 , said he " did not achieve the goals of the people " and had failed to meet the generals ' demands that he share power with his opposition			1
so where did it all go wrong ? a strict @entity50 educated in southern @entity51 , @entity0 was elected @entity1 's president in june 2012 after a campaign focused on appealing to the broadest possible audience			1
but critics say he became increasingly authoritarian and forced through a conservative agenda during his year in power			0
he is also blamed for failing to revive @entity1 's economy , which crashed when the 2011 uprising , which toppled longtime strongman @entity60 , drove tourists away			1
that led many of his supporters among @entity1 's poor and middle class to become disaffected , said @entity66 , director of the @entity67 at the @entity68 , speaking before @entity0 fell			1
" that some of the revolutionaries are calling on the army to return to politics is a testament to how polarized @entity1 is a year after the election of @entity0 , " @entity66 said			1
" think of the millions of people who cheered @entity0 after his election			2
think of the millions of @entity1 who pinned their hopes on @entity0			1
" a year later , now , the millions of @entity1 who cheered for @entity0 are saying he must go			1
" opinion : give @entity0 a chance to fix this @entity84 , writing for the @entity83 , described an @entity86 backlash that is the " product of mounting popular frustrations regarding the organization 's failed governance of @entity1 " during @entity0 's year in office			1
among the causes for complaint are lack of security , rising food prices , long fuel lines , and frequent electricity cuts during the scorching @entity1 summer , @entity84 said , all of which foster widespread @entity100 rage			0
" @entity102 , however , is in complete denial of this			0
@entity32 leaders and members contend that @entity0 has been a mostly successful president , " he said			1
huge challenges for @entity109 , a nonresident fellow at the @entity110 and senior lecturer at @entity112 , @entity0 faced an almost impossible challenge from the start			0
inexperienced in campaigning , he and his rivals made a raft of " wild promises " that raised expectations very high , and @entity0 could not deliver on them once elected with just over half the vote , @entity109 said			2
he inherited a huge public debt and a legacy of 30 years of corruption under president @entity60			0
dissatisfaction with economic conditions in the country was already high			0
@entity1 unrest pushes oil prices near $ 100 on taking office , he also experienced very strong resistance from a number within the state institutions , many of them @entity60 loyalists			2
the majority of those who backed him in the election are still behind him , @entity109 said			0
but some , including those who voted for @entity0 only because the alternative was to see @entity60 's former prime minister elected , have now joined the ranks of those lined up against him			1
those opposed to @entity0 include the @entity60 loyalists who seek a return to power ; the @entity147 , a broad coalition of opposition groups ; the youth groups who are disenchanted not to see major change after a year ; and the average citizen unaffiliated with any group but frustrated by rising costs			0
@entity156 , not inclusive @entity0 's personal style has contributed to his current predicament , @entity109 said			1
he lacks charisma and oratorical skills , and at the same time he has n't been able to back his orders with a stick in the same way that @entity60 and his predecessor , @entity164 , did , he said			1
although the country 's deficit has fallen and tourism revenue has slightly improved over the past year , the effects are not being felt by the man and woman on the street , @entity109 said , so @entity0 has not benefited			2
before his election , there were concerns in some quarters that @entity0 and the @entity32 would seek to introduce a fundamentalist @entity177 theocracy			1
what is the @entity32 ? but @entity109 rejects the idea that the discontent is ideologically motivated , saying it is in fact a " pragmatic " power struggle between those who won the democratic election and those who lost , as well as those who feel they lost out in @entity1 's 2011 revolution			1
@entity190 , director of research for the @entity110 , said " a long list of mistakes " had added to @entity0 's unpopularity			2
" he did n't do enough to build consensus among @entity1 's very fractious forces and he had a style of government that was n't inclusive , " he told @entity195			1
but @entity190 also highlighted the structural problems @entity0 faced			0
" anyone who was going to be president right now was going to deal with a deteriorating economy and a rotten , corrupt bureaucracy , many of whom are hostile to president @entity0 and the @entity32 , " he said			1
one example of that is the security sector , where a big chunk of the @entity211 did n't support him and then protested against him , he said			0
" part of it is @entity0 's fault			2
but we ca n't lose sight of the bigger perspective , that @entity1 is a very unwieldy country to govern and no one would have been able to make real improvements in the course of just one year			2
" troubled times after assuming office in june last year , @entity0 took a number of steps that proved unpopular with certain sectors of @entity1 society			1
in august , the president moved against the military leadership , sending into retirement @entity230 @entity229 , who , as chairman of the @entity233 , had acted the country 's de facto ruler in the wake of @entity60 's ouster and prior to @entity0 's election			1
a few months later , in november , he issued an edict declaring his decisions immune from judicial review until the holding of the constitutional referendum			0
he also sacked the head of the judiciary , many of whose members had remained loyal to @entity60			0
the opposition saw the moves as a grab for dictatorial powers and poured into the streets , converting @entity17 in central @entity18 back into the center of public discontent it had been during the uprising that brought down @entity60 in response , @entity0 dropped his decree , but the situation remained tense			0
his supporters were accused of beating and detaining opposition protesters during deadly clashes near the presidential palace in @entity18 in early december			0
after a referendum in which more than 60 % approved the new constitution , @entity0 signed it into law in late december			0
critics argued it was passed too quickly , with liberals , @entity271 and other minority opposition groups saying they felt excluded from the @entity273 that drafted it			0
supporters hailed what they said was its protection of personal rights			0
the international rights group @entity280 said the constitution " protects some rights but undermines others , " and that it " fails to end military trials of civilians or to protect freedom of expression and religion			0
" at the beginning of last month , the upper house and legislative power of parliament , the @entity291 , was invalidated by the country 's highest court			0
once a lower house is elected -- to replace the democratically elected parliament dissolved by the court last year -- the @entity50 - dominated @entity291 will be dissolved			1
new parliamentary elections are due later this year but @entity0 has not yet set a date			0
central player @entity0 served as a central behind - the - scenes player for much of the decade before his election to the presidency , analysts say			1
his official biography on the website of the @entity32 - affiliated @entity308 website describes him as " one of the most prominent political leadership figures of the @entity32 , the organization that led the struggle against the ousted repressive regime in its last decade			2
" he led the @entity32 's parliamentary bloc from 2000 to 2005 in addition to serving as president of the @entity316 , @entity317 at @entity318			2
@entity0 was arrested several times under @entity60 's regime " due to his constantly firm stance against the repressive measures and oppressive practices of the overthrown regime , " the party said			2
at one point , he spent seven months in jail			0
@entity0 told @entity195 's @entity329 during the election campaign that his party sought " an executive branch that represents the people 's true will and implements their public interests			2
" he also said he would support democracy , women 's rights and peaceful relations with @entity339 if he won			0
he added , " there is no such thing called an @entity177 democracy			0
... the people are the source of authority			0

@entity0 is pushed from office by @entity1 's military and is reportedly detained
@entity0 , of the @entity32 , was @entity1 's first freely elected president
@entity0 inherited a poor economy and corrupt bureaucracy , analysts say
the @entity359 - educated @entity50 lacks charisma and was n't an inclusive leader , they say
