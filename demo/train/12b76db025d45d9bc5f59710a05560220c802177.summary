the disappearance of @entity1 could take its place at the top of the biggest unsolved mysteries of history			2
" this is a very strange event , " aviation historian @entity6 said			2
" it does n't lend itself to the normal sets of explanations			2
" such mysteries are " phenomenally gripping , " @entity6 said			2
" things that are unsolved just sort of grab people , especially when you have the common experience of flying			2
" answers about what happen to the @entity20 and the people on board must come soon , he said			2
" when you get on the plane the next time , are you going to wonder a little bit about whether you are going to disappear ? " but history holds tight to some secrets , leaving us with just speculation , conspiracy theories and educated guesses			1
a mystery can have a long life , never forgotten and often re-examined			2
here are some of history 's most tantalizing mysteries and debatable events : who shot @entity39 and @entity40 ? the assassination of @entity43 president @entity42 on november 22 , 1963 , remains one of the most shocking events of the 20th century			1
the shooting of his brother @entity47 on june 5 , 1968 , added to the conspiracy theories			1
in each case , a lone gunman was accused			2
in both deaths , questions remain : was there a second shooter on a grassy knoll along @entity39 's motorcade route ? how could a man with a mail - order rifle target the president in a moving car from such a distance ? @entity63 was himself shot to death at a @entity66 police station days after @entity39 's death			1
a blue ribbon panel headed by @entity70 chief justice @entity69 concluded @entity63 was the only assassin , but a @entity72 survey six decades later found 60 % of @entity43 do n't believe that			2
as for @entity40 , a witness told @entity75 in 2012 that she heard two guns firing during the 1968 shooting in @entity78 and that authorities altered her account of the crime			1
the mystery of @entity83 the @entity85 coroner ruled that actress @entity83 's august 1962 death was a " probable suicide " from an overdose of barbiturates			1
despite the official conclusion , questions have lingered for decades about her death at 36			0
the fuel for conspiracy theories include discrepancies about what time her body was found , the disappearance of her internal organs at the morgue and her links to president @entity42 and his brother @entity47 , as well as organized crime bosses			1
also , the @entity83 the world saw was not the real @entity83			1
she was not a dumb blonde , but an intelligent , well - read brunette , according to those who knew her			0
was @entity112 's death an accident or murder ? the death of actress @entity112 , whose was found floating off @entity117 's @entity116 in november 1981 , was initially ruled an " accidental drowning , " but the @entity85 coroner officially changed the death certificate last year to read " drowning and other undetermined factors			1
" homicide investigators decided to take a new look at one of @entity127 's most enduring mysteries after they were contacted by people who said they had additional information about the actress ' drowning , the @entity122 said			2
@entity133 's death happened during a trip on her yacht with husband @entity137 and actor @entity138			0
" since there are unanswered questions and limited additional evidence available for evaluation , it is opined by this medical examiner that the manner of death should be left as undetermined , " the coroner said in a 2012 statement			0
what happened to @entity150 ? famed aviator @entity150 vanished along with navigator @entity151 during a doomed attempt to fly around the world in 1937			1
" there 's still no concrete evidence as to what happened , " @entity6 said			0
theories about her fate included one that @entity150 's plane was forced down by the @entity162 around the @entity163			1
another is that @entity150 secretly returned to the @entity43 and the government gave her a new identity			1
@entity150 was on the last segment of her global route , flying from @entity169 , @entity170 , with a destination 2,500 miles away in the middle of the @entity173			1
if her plane crashed into the waters short of her planned refueling point on @entity178 , the wreckage is likely resting 17,500 feet below the ocean 's surface			0
only in recent years has it been possible to explore those depths with underwater vehicles			0
expeditions scanning the ocean 's floor have offered tantalizing evidence in the past two years that @entity150 's plane could be near @entity188 in the @entity173			1
where is @entity190 ? @entity191 boss @entity190 was last seen on july 30 , 1975 , outside a @entity193 - area restaurant			1
his disappearance is a mystery that triggers occasional digs by @entity198 agents looking for his remains			0
the last such search centered on a field near @entity193 in june 2013 , based on a tip from alleged mobster @entity204 that @entity190 was hit with a shovel and buried alive there			1
nothing was uncovered after three days of work with a backhoe			0
the @entity198 said at the time of his disappearance that it could have been linked to @entity190 's efforts to regain power in the @entity214 and to the mob 's influence over the union 's pension funds			1
@entity190 was thought to be trying to get back into a power position with the labor movement after his release from prison			1
he was sent to prison in 1967 for jury tampering and fraud			0
president @entity226 pardoned him in 1971			0
popular theories over the years include that @entity190 was disposed of under the old @entity228 in @entity229 , buried in a @entity231 horse farm , taken to a @entity233 swamp as alligator food or that his body was incinerated			1
another early theory was that @entity190 simply took off for @entity237 with a go - go dancer			1
@entity190 's middle name , by the way , is @entity241			1
who was @entity243 ? the name @entity245 came from a letter sent in 1888 to @entity248 police , purporting to be the killer of five prostitutes			0
his true identity has never been proved			0
stories about the serial killings on the streets of @entity248 captured readers around the world , spurring intense speculation that lasted well beyond a century			0
crime writer @entity258 contributed to the theories with her 2002 book " @entity261 -- @entity245 : case closed			2
" @entity258 fingers painter @entity264 , in part based on the similar watermarks on the letter to police and @entity264 's personal writing paper			0
she also argued that many of his paintings depicted @entity243 crime scenes			0
the ghost ship @entity274 the twin - masted merchant vessel @entity274 set sail from @entity278 on november 7 , 1872 , bound for @entity279 , @entity280			1
its 10 passengers were not on board when it was found floating in the middle of the @entity285 four weeks later			0
there were no signs of a struggle , and all of its cargo was still on board			0
its only lifeboat was missing			2
speculation over the past 140 years about why the ship was abandoned include theories involving pirates , a crew mutiny and even monster from the sea			1
a documentary titled " @entity303 of the @entity274 " released in 2007 ruled out those possibilities but stopped short of a conclusive explanation			1
what 's the deal with the @entity308 ? the legend of the @entity308 began with the unexplained disappearance of a group of military planes carrying 14 men off the coast of south @entity233 in december 1945			1
" we are entering white water , nothing seems right , " the flight leader supposedly said before radio contact was lost			0
thirteen more servicemen sent to search for the missing fliers also vanished			2
other mysterious disappearances and encounters have been linked to the area of ocean that is a triangle anchored by @entity308 , @entity233 and @entity327			1
two @entity330 @entity329 passenger planes disappeared in the area a year apart in 1948 and 1949			0
no explanations or wreckage were ever found			0
victims credited to the area in numerous books and documentaries have included a large oil tanker , a pleasure yacht and a small passenger plane			0
books , including " @entity342 , " " @entity343 , " and " @entity344 of the @entity308 , " suggest supernatural explanations			1
aliens in spaceships , wormholes and the mythical lost continent of @entity350 have been blamed			0
are @entity351 , @entity351 or @entity352 for real ? stories of elusive giant , hairy human - like beasts have been told on several continents for centuries			1
in the @entity359 , it is known as the @entity352 or the @entity352			1
@entity360 have reported sightings of @entity351 or @entity351			1
@entity362 call theirs the @entity363			0
one common feature in modern reports is that most photos are blurry and video is shaky			0
serious examination often leads to conclusions of mistaken identity or elaborate hoaxes			0
but just last year , a @entity330 geneticist said that hair samples supposedly from two of the mystery creatures proved to be a genetic match to an ancient polar bear			0
the scientist submitted his dna results for publication in a peer - reviewed science journal , and it is due to publish a book based on his research this year			0
is the @entity385 a real creature ? the earliest documented sighting of the mysterious creature swimming in @entity389 's @entity385 came in 1871 , according to the monster 's official website			1
yes , it has a website that serves the purpose of promoting tourism to the area			0
dozens of sightings have been logged since then , including the most recent in november 2011 when a mr. @entity399 reported seeing a " slow moving hump " emerge from the murky depths of @entity401			0
a @entity43 research team targeted @entity385 -- the creature 's affectionate nickname -- in 2009 using a submarine to explore the lake 's bottom			2
the only discovery were thousands of golf balls 300 feet down and 100 yards off the shore			0
no mystery there , though : locals and tourists have been known to practice their golf swing there for years			0
was the @entity418 the burial cloth for @entity419 ? the @entity418 may be the most famous religious relic			1
some @entity420 believe the shroud , which appears to bear the imprint of a man 's body , to be @entity419 's burial cloth			1
the body appears to have wounds that match those the @entity429 describes as having been suffered by @entity419 on the cross			2
many scholars contest the shroud 's authenticity , saying it dates to the @entity435 , when many purported biblical relics -- such as splinters from @entity419 ' cross -- surfaced across @entity439			2
even the @entity440 does not insist the shroud was used to wrap the body of @entity419			2
its official position is that the shroud is an important tool for faith regardless of its authenticity			0
just before stepping aside as @entity448 a year ago , @entity447 authorize the broadcast of video of the shroud from @entity452 , where the mysterious @entity454 relic is kept out of sight in a bulletproof , climate - controlled glass case .			0
