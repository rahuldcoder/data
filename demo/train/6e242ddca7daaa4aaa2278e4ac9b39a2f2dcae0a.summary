-- before super yachts , luxury sailboats and passenger ferries , the preferred method of water travel was by steamboat			2
until the first steamboat was built in the late 1700s , boats were powered by wind and sail			2
since steamboats did n't depend as much on wind direction and currents , they offered more control			1
steam engines function similarly to a tea kettle on a stove , says @entity19 , executive director of the @entity20			2
water is heated to a boil , creating steam that 's controlled under pressure			1
the steam is then released , mechanically powering the vessel and getting the engine moving			0
by the mid- 19th century , steamboats became a popular mode of transportation in @entity30 , @entity19 said			1
" the rivers , lakes and oceans could serve as a network of transportation long before trails , railroads and highways could accommodate the masses , " said @entity19			1
while steam and sail boats operated simultaneously into the early 1900s , steamboats remained dominant into the mid- 20th century , when ships powered by diesel engines started to become mainstream			1
because of their immense size and weight , and the large crew necessary to operate them , steamboats were much more expensive to operate than ships powered by smaller , lighter , modern diesel engines			1
with steamboats , " you can see , smell and hear what 's happening , and then understand why they work just from going on one , " @entity19 said			1
" @entity55 of @entity56 turns 100 this year , which offers a great opportunity for people to participate			1
" here are seven steamboats -- including the @entity60 -- that visitors can still enjoy in the @entity30			1

the @entity151 was also used by people wanting a tour of the lake , and it remained a popular means of transportation for both groups until the late 1920s , when steamboats began to fade away			1
although it cruises the same water today , the @entity151 spent decades on the bottom of the lake			2
the steamboat sank in 1926 and was n't raised until 1980			0
ten years after @entity151 was brought to the surface , the restoration began and was completed in 1996			0
the wood hull was rebuilt because of damage caused by spending a decade on land , and the original boiler that burned coal was converted to a model that burns fuel			0

the @entity216 still has the two - cylinder steam engine that was installed in 1908 , carrying passengers on daily cruises along the @entity233			0
