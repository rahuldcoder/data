@entity0 , @entity1 -- a dried - out swimming pool , 300 empty rooms and destroyed elevators			1
the @entity6 , once the most exclusive hotel in @entity1 , is now just a shadow of its former splendor			1
but the floors still have marble and the view over the capital @entity0 is worth climbing the 15 flights of stairs			0
there are many bullet riddled and bombed out buildings like the @entity19 in @entity1			1
they are grim reminders of the brutal 14 - year civil war that devastated the @entity23 country and killed an estimated 250,000 people			1
the past decade of peace has stabilized the political situation as well as generated government revenues from the mining sector			0
read this : @entity1 : from warzone to holiday paradise ? but there is one small business in particular that has prospered into a big industry : motorcycle taxis			1

" every young man needed a job and these are the only means of employment in this country now , " says @entity47 motorcycle driver @entity46			2
flourishing business @entity1 's @entity54 estimates that there were around 500,000 drivers in the country , as of 2012			1
they earn between $ 6 -20 per day , in a country where the minimum wage is $ 6 a day			2
today , there are three registered motorcycle taxi driver unions and the national secretary of the @entity63 , @entity59 , says his union is helping to formalize a flourishing trade			2

from motorcycle driver to college student the motorcycle taxis are known as " pen - pens , " a name that comes from the sound of their constant horn blowing			1

" how many of ( the drivers ) are in school ? how many of them have had accidents ? when we get that done what we are thinking about is to see how we transition some of them from riding motorcycles to owning cars , going to colleges and so forth , " says @entity59			0
