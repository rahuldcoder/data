-- march 14 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 , @entity6 transcript this is a @entity9			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity13 , @entity14 : we 're dedicating this edition of @entity0 to our audience in @entity4			1
the world is watching in support , and you are not alone			2
first up : @entity21 @entity22 : the nation of @entity4 is reeling today , trying to recover from a devastating natural disaster			1
the earthquake hit the island nation on friday			1
it registered a magnitude of 8.9			2
that makes it the most powerful quake to hit @entity4 in at least 100 years			1
there were reports over the weekend that the quake moved the main of island of @entity4 -- the entire island -- by 8 feet ! and this is what it left behind : scenes of destruction			1
on sunday , officials estimated that more than 1,500 people had been killed ; more than 1,900 injured ; more than 1,500 more missing			2
those estimates all expected to go up			2
and the worst may not be over			2
witnesses have reported feeling aftershocks			2
and scientists in @entity4 say that there 's a strong chance of another quake , one with a magnitude of 7.0 or higher , hitting in the next few days			1
just to get a sense of what this was like , take a listen to this @entity57			2
this was shot by someone outside his house			0
you can hear the crashes as the area is rattled by the quake			1
something just as devastating as the quake was the tsunami -- this giant ocean wave -- that the quake caused			1
it slammed into the @entity4 coast , washing over cities and leaving death and destruction behind it			1
@entity75 @entity22 : the northeastern part of the country took the worst of it			0
this is what the water looked like rushing into one city			0
some areas were completely flattened , with foundations the only sign of the buildings that once stood on them			0
you might think of a tsunami as this towering tidal wave that crashes down on shore			1
that 's not what this was			1
tsunamis are more accurately described as these " walls of water " that push onto shore and plow through anything they hit			1
scientists believe that when there 's friction between two plates below the ocean 's surface , like in an earthquake , energy is released			1
that energy shoots up to the surface , spreads out in a wave			0
and it travels very fast , as fast as 500 miles per hour ! you can see it spreading right here			0
now , if you 're in a boat out at sea , you might not even feel it			0
it 's incredibly powerful , but not necessarily very high			1
but look at what happens when that wave gets closer to shore : it slows down and builds up			0
and that wall of water just bulldozes inland			0
look at how this tsunami wave spread			1
this animation shows you just how far these things can travel			0
it stretched out in all directions , spanning the @entity132			0
it hit @entity134 , causing millions of dollars in damage there			1
and it even reached the @entity6 coast , 5,000 miles from the area near @entity4 where the quake hit			1
and when the wave did reach @entity5 , @entity6 , it was still strong enough to do this : boats tossed like toys in the tub			0
it 's not nearly as destructive as what happened in @entity4 , but a clear illustration of ocean energy radiated across the world			1
@entity21 @entity22 : trying to put the impact of this earthquake in perspective			1
@entity4 's prime minister , @entity155 , called it " the toughest and most difficult crisis " for his country since the end of @entity159 , more than 65 years ago			1
he said he 's confident that the @entity4 people can work together to overcome the crisis			1
that could include making sacrifices , like dealing with electrical blackouts for one thing			0
the government is planning to run these rolling blackouts in order to save electricity while workers repair power plants			1
but prime minister @entity155 says right now , @entity4 has one main goal			1
@entity155 , @entity4 prime minister : saving people 's lives must be our first priority			1
we must do all that we are able to do to save as many lives as we can now			0
just the facts @entity180 , @entity14 : just the facts ! nuclear power plants generate power through a process called nuclear fission			1
this is when atoms of uranium , a radioactive element , are split apart			0
@entity190 produces a lot of heat energy , and that energy produces steam			0
the steam turns a turbine , and that 's how the plants generate electricity			2
meltdown concerns @entity22 : officials in @entity4 are worried about what 's happening at one of the country 's nuclear power plants			1
it has six reactors , six facilities where that fission happens			0
and three of those reactors were running when the quake hit			1
the plant has safeguards in place for this kind of a situation			2
the reactors are supposed to shut down , and emergency generators are supposed to pump water into the reactors to cool them down			0
remember , fission generates heat , so if you want it to stop heat quickly , you need to cool it down			0
but in one of those three reactors , the back - up generators failed			0
experts are blaming that on flooding from the tsunami			2
another element -- hydrogen -- started building up inside the facility until it caused an explosion that blew the roof off			2
the reactor was not damaged in the explosion			0
but that 's the big concern here : a problem with the reactor			2
like we said , the uranium inside of it is radioactive			0
and if too much of that radiation gets out , it could contaminate air or water and lead to very serious health problems			0
@entity253 @entity22 : you heard @entity4 's prime minister say that the number one priority is saving lives			1
rescue crews have been working furiously to try to find and help the victims of this earthquake			1
and the world is coming to @entity4 's aid as well			1
the @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 : just a handful of the nearly 70 countries that have offered to help			0
some search - and - rescue teams have already arrived in @entity4			1
more are on the way			0
international aid groups , like the @entity274 , @entity272 and @entity275 are getting involved , too			0
the @entity276 -- the warship that you see here -- is also on the scene			0
crew members are working with @entity4 forces to fly supplies and equipment into the areas that were hit hard by the quake			1
they 're hoping to deliver 30,000 portions of emergency food supplies in the first run			0
impact your world @entity22 : sometimes , you hear about a crisis somewhere in the world and wonder " what can i do ? " we have a way for you			2
@entity0 's " @entity298 " program has information on some of the groups that are helping the victims of this quake , and it has ways for you to get involved			1
you 'll find a link to " @entity305 " in the @entity307 section of our home page , @entity309			2
goodbye @entity22 : this is a huge story , and one that we 'll certainly be covering more on our show			0
but there 's also a lot of information up on our web site			2
we have in depth coverage on the quake itself and explainers on things like earthquake magnitudes and how nuclear reactors work			1
finally today , we have a video that demonstrates the power of this natural disaster and its impact on @entity4			1
we 're going to let that close out the show , and we 'll see you again tomorrow			0
( begin video ) @entity331 , @entity332 , @entity333 : my wife and i stood outside and basically held on to the outside of our house			0
you could n't even stand up			0
we have never , ever felt anything on the magnitude , the literal magnitude , of what we experienced today			2
@entity343 , @entity332 , @entity333 : the whole ground was shaking so much			0
i ca n't describe it			0
@entity348 : oh , my god			0
that is the biggest earthquake to date			2
oh , my god , the building 's going to fall ! @entity352 , @entity332 , @entity333 : it just blew up			2
@entity354 ! @entity354 ! do you all see this ? @entity357 , @entity332 , @entity333 : the crack is just moving			0
i do n't know if water lines are broken , but this water was not there a minute ago			0
