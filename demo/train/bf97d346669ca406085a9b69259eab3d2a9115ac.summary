@entity0 -- to the casual observer , the @entity2 may seem like a monolithic , united entity			1
in recent years , its leadership has ruled collectively , rather than by the hand of a paramount leader , which was a characteristic of the @entity10 and @entity11 eras			1
but while the party outwardly stresses harmony and unity , political analysts believe its estimated 80 - million - strong members are divided along deep - rooted factional lines with varying perspectives on social , economic , political , military and foreign affairs			1
@entity1 looks at what makes the @entity23 party machine tick			1
who are the key factional powers within the party ? the @entity2 is broadly divided between informal " elitist " and " populist " coalitions , according to @entity30 expert and @entity32 analyst @entity31			1
other analysts conceive of the split in different terms , such as between liberal - minded reformist and conservative hard - liner camps			1
@entity31 argues the core elitist faction is the " taizidang , " or so - called " princelings " -- the offspring of former revolutionary leaders and high - ranking officials			1
another elite , albeit fading , faction is the so - called " @entity47 , " or followers of @entity49 , who served as mayor of @entity51 before becoming @entity30 's supreme leader in 1989			1
the populists are dominated by the " tuanpai " -- politicians who cut their teeth in the @entity57 , the party 's nation - wide organization for youth aged 14 - 28 to study and promote communism			1
the league is also a training ground for party cadres			2
but any analysis of these factional allegiances must be treated with caution -- as an educated but speculative discussion at best -- given the lack of official information and the complexities influencing politicians ' backgrounds			0
" factional lines are often unclear , shifting or overlapping , conditioned by old alliances , family interconnections , conflicts , rivalries , shifting loyalties and pragmatic tactical considerations , " according to @entity1 's @entity83 bureau chief , @entity82			0
" in some cases , these affiliations are also conditioned by the members ' work patron / protégé experience , i.e. with or under whom they worked and rose to power			0
" how are these factions oriented ? broadly speaking , the factions run along socioeconomic and geographic divides			2
the elitist coalition tends to represent business interests , including entrepreneurs and the rising middle class of @entity30 's affluent coastal regions , according to @entity31			2
the princelings typically have prestigious backgrounds as the descendents of former party heroes , tending to have credentials governing affluent provinces along @entity30 's eastern coast			2
for example @entity106 , the disgraced politician once tipped for political stardom in @entity30 , is the son of @entity109 , a former @entity110 member who last served as vice-chairman of the @entity112 during the @entity11 era			0
some politicians have sought to round out their resumes with credentials across geographic and socioeconomic lines			0
@entity109 famously adopted a populist approach invoking @entity10 nostalgia during his tenure as party secretary of @entity122 , while @entity123 -- widely expected to become @entity30 's next president -- left a prestigious post in @entity83 to work in rural @entity126 for three years			1
@entity31 says the elitists are currently headed by @entity128 , chairman and party secretary of the @entity131 ( the national legislature ) and @entity132 , chairman and party secretary of the @entity135 ( the advisory body of delegates from different political parties and parts of @entity30			1
) both are protégés of former president , @entity141			0
as the name implies , the populist coalition tends to promote an agenda representing the concerns of the urban and rural poor , including migrants and farmers			2
the tuanpai core faction typically comes from humble backgrounds and worked their way up the ranks via the @entity57 in @entity83 and inland provinces			0
@entity31 says the populists are currently led by president @entity156 and premier @entity157 , who have accordingly promoted policies such as eliminating agricultural taxes , developing inland cities and promoting affordable housing			2
a further contrast , @entity31 says , is that princelings tend to have a great depth of experience in economic policy , including banking and foreign trade and investment , whereas the tuanpai tend to be more skilled in rural administration			0
@entity156 's heir apparent , @entity123 , is a princeling , whereas @entity157 's likely successor , @entity172 , represents the tuanpai			0
what is the @entity175 ? the 18th @entity131 of the @entity2 will officially unveil the new members of the @entity175 , the innermost sanctum and supreme decision - making body of the @entity2 — and by extension the leaders of @entity30 's government			1
party members typically occupy its highest positions			2
members are typically drawn from those already on the standing committee , as well as the broader @entity110 overseeing the @entity2			1
the standing committee is a subset of the @entity110			0
it is also possible that a @entity191 member could be promoted directly into the standing committee , as in the case of @entity123 and @entity172 during the 17th party congress			2
members must also fall within the unofficial retirement age of 68 ( i.e. born from 1945 onward ) , says @entity31			0
beyond these basic criteria follows what @entity31 calls an " extraordinarily complicated and multi-faceted deal - making process " to narrow the pool to nine members			2
speculation is rife that the upcoming committee will be cut to seven members			0
while the closed - door process involves complex factional negotiations and power struggles that few in the outside world are privy to , @entity31 says the overriding factor is " patron - client " ties , meaning departing members attempting to prolong their influence and protect their interests by placing their protégés onto the committee			0
this involves compromise and deal - making behind the scenes			0
how will these factions be represented in future ? @entity30 watchers widely expect that two of the current standing committee members , @entity123 and @entity172 , will retain their membership			0
their factional inclinations are reflected in their policy priorities , says @entity31 of the @entity32			0
@entity123 is focused on the private sector , market liberation in foreign investment , and @entity51 's role as a financial and shipping center			0
in contrast , @entity172 emphasizes affordable housing , basic health care and clean energy			0
this equilibrium extends within the upper echelons of the leadership , which is about evenly split between the elitists and populists , according to @entity31			1
most analysts concur that the era of charismatic , paramount leaders ended after @entity11 , replaced by relatively colorless technocrats who governed through collective leadership			1
what does this mean for @entity30 's future ? out of necessity , this balance has led the elitist and populist coalitions to adopt a collaborative approach of collective leadership rather than a zero - sum game mentality , underpinned by shared fundamental goals : " to ensure @entity30 's socioeconomic stability as well as the survival of @entity2 role at home , and to enhance @entity30 's status as a major international player , " @entity31 said			1
the analyst says this collective leadership style is the " defining feature of today 's @entity23 elite politics			1

@entity2 not monolithic , united entity
analysts say party broadly divided between informal " elitist " and " populist " coalitions
