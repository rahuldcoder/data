the @entity1 administration finalized rules on friday that allow religious - affiliated organizations opposing the use of contraception to opt out of a federal mandate requiring that they provide their employees with insurance coverage for birth control			1
the mandates give women at nonprofit , religious - based organizations , like certain hospitals and universities , the ability to receive contraception through separate health policies at no charge			1
the rules , which were first proposed in february and then open for comment through april , have undergone only minor changes			1
@entity23 , deputy director for policy and regulations at the @entity28 @entity27 , said in a call with reporters that the rules were " very similar " to the administration 's original proposal			2
one of the few noticeable changes is the process by which insurance companies reimburse nonprofit religious organizations -- such as nonprofit religious hospitals and institutions of higher education -- that object to contraceptive coverage			1
this process , officials from @entity27 said , has provided more distance between the groups that disapprove of contraceptive use and the insurance companies that will be supplying contraceptives to their employees at no cost			0
these slight changes , said one @entity27 representative , came after hearing from stakeholders during a public comment period this year			0
in total , more than 400,000 comments were sent to the department on the rule			0
objecting organizations and insurers will have until january 1 , 2014 , to comply with the new rules			0
this date was extended from august 1 , 2013			0
" the health care law guarantees millions of women access to recommended preventive services at no cost , " @entity27 secretary @entity63 said in a friday news release			0
" today 's announcement reinforces our commitment to respect the concerns of houses of worship and other non-profit religious organizations that object to contraceptive coverage , while helping to ensure that women get the care they need , regardless of where they work			1
" since @entity81 was signed into law in 2010 , administration officials have said the administration has attempted to work out how nonprofit organizations can decline to provide contraception coverage to their employees on religious grounds without facing a penalty			1
in a news release about the finalized plans , administration officials say these final rules " strike the appropriate " balance			1
in february , the health agency said that while it could not provide a final cost of the plan , offering free coverage would lower expenses over the long term , partly because of improvements in women 's health and fewer childbirths			1
as part of the new rules , groups that are insured -- such as with student health plans at religious colleges -- would be required to let their insurer know that certain participants would like contraception coverage			1
because the insurer would be covering the costs , the changes would allow religious organizations morally opposed to contraception to avoid paying for it			2
although many religious groups applauded the compromise , not everyone heralded it as a success			2
the @entity121 said in february that it does not support the @entity1 administration 's proposals because they fall short of addressing concerns about religious freedom			1
" because the stakes are so high , we will not cease from our effort to assure that health care for all does not mean freedom for few , " cardinal @entity126 of @entity127 , president of the conference , said in a february statement			0
" we will continue to stand united with brother bishops , religious institutions , and individual citizens who seek redress in the courts for as long as this is necessary			0
" those calls of disapproval continued after friday 's finalization of the contraceptive plans			0
" this latest rule shows the administration is tone - deaf to religious freedom , " said @entity145 , director at the @entity146			2
" @entity146 strongly opposes the latest regulation that continues to mandate that life - ending drugs and contraceptive services be covered , with no copay , by health plans of businesses and organizations that have serious moral and religious objections			0
" @entity158 , director of the @entity159 for @entity27 , said the changes that were made took into account suggestions from religious organizations that objected to the rules			2
" i think there is a much brighter line , simpler line , and we think that responds to the good many comments that we got , " he said			0
an original mandate on providing contraception was part of the new federal health care law spearheaded by president @entity1 , the @entity81			1
it required that insurers provide , at no cost to those insured , all forms of contraception approved by the @entity175			2
houses of worship were exempt immediately , and the administration widened those exemptions last year to include other religiously affiliated organizations , like universities and hospitals			2
that still left groups across a wide spectrum of faiths -- many of which teach that contraception is morally wrong -- covered by the mandate			2
they denounced it as an infringement on religious liberty			1
a group of 43 @entity200 organizations challenged the rules in federal court in may			0
the administration had long defended the mandate , saying that it did not violate religious liberties			2
the finalized proposal also clarified the definition of a religious employer			0
instead of using a multipart test that required an employer to show " religious values as its purpose " and to " employ persons who share its religious tenets , " the proposal followed the @entity219 's definition that includes " churches , other houses of worship , and their affiliated organizations			0
" after an uproar among religious institutions that did n't want to pay for contraceptives , the @entity1 administration offered several alternatives in march 2012			1
these plans are a continuation of those efforts			0
the issue of @entity1 's health care act mandating contraception coverage became a hot - button political issue during last year 's presidential race			1
in august 2012 , @entity238 nominee @entity237 released a television ad that attacked the @entity1 administration			1
" president @entity1 used his health care plan to declare war on religion , forcing religious institutions to go against their faith , " the ad said			1
" @entity237 believes that is wrong			0
" although the ad did not specifically mention the contraception rule , a news release that accompanied the ad justified the " war on religion " claim using an editorial published in the @entity252 in february about the health care law 's rule on providing contraception .			0

rules let groups like religious hospitals , *schools* to decline to provide contraception coverage
but women would still get coverage ; outside provider would pay for contraception
the rules , first proposed in february , appear to have undergone only minor changes
@entity1 administration : rules appropriately balance religious liberty , contraception coverage
