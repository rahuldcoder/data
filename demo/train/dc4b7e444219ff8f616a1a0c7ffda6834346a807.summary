after days of descending on cities @entity4 , protesters demanding an end to police brutality are expected to get loud again saturday			1
in recent weeks , throngs have taken to the streets nationwide after grand juries decided not to indict white police officers in the deaths of @entity10 near @entity11 and @entity12 in @entity13			1
saturday will culminate what organizers are calling a " @entity18 , " with large demonstrations planned in major cities			1
" our message is very simple , " wrote @entity19 , founder of the @entity20 , one of the main organizers of the protests			1
" since the ' normal routine ' of @entity26 has always included murder of black and @entity29 people by law enforcement , this week , that ' normal routine must be disrupted			2
' " the protests started friday at @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35 , and outside @entity36 in @entity11			1
a @entity11 police officer will be disciplined because he showed up at @entity36 with a " @entity42 " badge on his right arm , police spokesman @entity37 said			1
the badge apparently referred to @entity44 police officer @entity42 , who shot and killed @entity10 in august			1
@entity45 said the badge violated a department rule about prohibited insignia			1
@entity49 of the @entity11 @entity50 fired back , saying , " the @entity26 @entity51 has consistently described demonstrations where police officers were shot at and police had @entity56 cocktails thrown at them as constitutional , protected free speech , but police officers are apparently not allowed to exercise their constitutional rights to express their support for a fellow police officer exonerated of wrong doing			1
" protesters in major cities , including @entity13 and @entity64 , plan marches for saturday afternoon			1
@entity66 , the son of the man who died after a @entity13 police officer held him in what appeared to be a chokehold , said he was proud of the protests			1
" it 's amazing how everybody ( is ) doing this			2
my father and i appreciate it , " the son told @entity79 's " @entity78			2
" some peaceful protests across the country this week have been marred by bouts of violence and crowds that disrupted thousands of motorists by shutting down freeways			1
but despite those instances , protests have continued to draw some notable names			1
more join chorus for change in @entity64 , minority congressional staffers walked off their jobs and gathered on the steps of the @entity95 on thursday with their hands raised to show support for the families of @entity10 and @entity12			2
rep. @entity99 , @entity100 , who fought to end segregation and racial discrimination in the @entity103 in the 1960s , also joined the group			2
and the support is not limited to political figures			2
the @entity109 ' @entity108 is one of the big names speaking out			0
before the team faced the @entity112 on the basketball court monday night , @entity108 wore a t - shirt that said " i ca n't breathe " -- @entity12 's last words , which have become a rallying cry for protesters			0

@entity125 was n't built in a day			0
" @entity126 weighs in but police are pushing back			2
in @entity13 , the @entity129 's @entity128 sent a form for members to sign and return to their @entity133 delegate requesting the mayor not attend their funeral if the officer is killed in the line of duty because of the mayor 's " consistent refusal to show police officers the support and respect they deserve			1
" the city replied with a statement , saying : " this is deeply disappointing			0
incendiary rhetoric like this serves only to divide the city , and @entity13 reject these tactics			0
the mayor and the speaker both know better than to think this inappropriate stunt represents the views of the majority of police officers and their families			2
" president @entity126 spoke about the future of race relations in @entity26 to a network that reaches a predominantly young @entity162 - @entity26 audience			0
" what i told the young people who i met with -- we 're going to have more conversations over the coming months -- is , ' this is n't something that is going to be solved overnight , ' @entity126 said on @entity170			0
" ' this is something that is deeply rooted in our society			0
it 's deeply rooted in our history			0
' " in his interview , the president said @entity162 - @entity26 youths need to be both persistent and patient in order to make progress on the issue of racial tensions in @entity26			0

a @entity13 grand jury decided last week not to indict @entity189 in @entity12 's death			0
" he indicated he never used a chokehold , " said @entity191 , his attorney			0
" he used a takedown technique he was taught in the academy			0
he said he never exerted any pressure on the windpipe and never intended to injure mr. @entity12			0
