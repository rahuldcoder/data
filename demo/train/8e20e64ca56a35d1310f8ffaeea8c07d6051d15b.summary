-- the legendary @entity1 fueled his success with a daily diet of steak and potatoes			2
hell raising stars of the recent past were not adverse to sinking more than a few beers after a tough match			0
but the modern tennis star is more likely to be teetotal and to stick to a gluten free diet -- avoiding the red meat and carbs which five - time @entity14 champion @entity1 apparently ate every day			1
doubles stalwart and @entity17 player council member @entity16 should know			1
he 's been on the circuit for nearly a decade and rubs shoulders with the likes of @entity21 and @entity22 both on and off the court			1
" i think the top players have cut alcohol completely out of their diet and the rest of the players to stay competitive have mostly followed suit , " @entity16 told @entity0 's @entity25 program			1
" it 's funny because actually our tour sponsor is @entity35 -- so there are @entity37 available wherever we want , in the locker room and in the players ' lounge but it 's surprising that at the end of the week they are often not even touched			2
serious endeavor " for the most part guys treat their bodies like a temple and take it very seriously			0
" @entity49 believes the established " @entity50 " of @entity51 , @entity22 , @entity52 and @entity21 have permanently raised the bar as regards fitness and diet issues and there is no going back			1
with the rewards for success so large -- $ 31 million on offer at the 2014 season opening @entity62 -- any small margins gained can be worth a small fortune			0
" if you look at the amount of money that can be won at the top of the sport or any major sport so you know that line between @entity71 and @entity72 in the world is worth millions and millions of dollars so i think you see these guys doing every little thing they can to achieve that , " added @entity16			1
former @entity14 champion @entity78 said that the move to a great emphasis on fitness and diet started during his glory years in the 1980s and 90s , but his predecessors were not so careful			2
" i heard stories that the old @entity87 greats used to play hard and drink hard and used to have steak and potatoes , " said @entity78			0
" i once asked @entity1 ' what did you eat ? ' and he said ' every day i had a steak and i had potatoes ' and he used to play five sets of practice every day and back it up day in day out with steak and potatoes ! " gluten free modern superstars such as @entity22 would not dream of that approach and it was the @entity100 who started a trend with his gluten free diet , cutting out wheat and treats such as chocolate			1
" this particular diet changed my life really in a positive way and affected positively my career and my overall feeling on and off the court , " @entity22 said			1
as he charged to @entity71 and went through 2011 with just a handful of defeats , others took notice and followed suit			0
" @entity22 really made that popular when he really rose to the top , " said @entity16			1
" i do n't know if it 's a fad or if it 's here to stay but it 's definitely a thing that a high percentage of the guys on tour now are gluten free or almost primarily gluten free			1
" i watch them taking strolls around the breakfast bar in @entity127 , bypassing the croissants and the pain au chocolats , all the different tempting things and actually staying away from it			0
it 's pretty impressive to see them do it ! " they are helped by the more healthy offerings available at the @entity17 and @entity139 's official tournaments and with players on the road for half of the year , maybe more , this is vital			2
" players are looking to eat a lot of salads , a lot of fruits , pastas and then white meats , chicken and fish are really popular , " @entity16 said			1
healthy options " the cuisine can vary tournament to tournament but also normally what the tournaments week in week out provide is some really healthy options that allows us to stay very fit			0
" but with this austere regime -- fat free and alcohol free -- has the sheer joie de vivre gone out of the game ? " i believe the fun on the tour has dropped , " said @entity49			1
" there is very little alcohol consumed as players take their matches and practice very seriously			1
" but the tour is still a great place to be and there is plenty of fun to be had , though the stories we hear about what it was like ' back in the day , ' it is n't even close nowadays			0
" the 1987 @entity14 champion @entity78 , who retired in 1997 , said in his era there was still a high degree of professionalism but the difference has been advances in sports science			0
" you know more about nutrition			0
in my day it was all about carbo loading and i think it 's slightly different now , it 's not just about having carbohydrates because you need protein for your muscles to recover as well , " said the @entity87 great			0
@entity16 , who is 32 , has had to battle to earn a living on the @entity17 and establish himself as the @entity201 doubles player behind the incredible @entity203 ( @entity204 and @entity205 )			1
a recent victory in the doubles at the @entity208 with @entity209 was proof he is still a force at the top level and aside from attention to diet , @entity49 , like many others , is training smarter			2
" i have become more attuned to listening to my body , when it needs rest , icing , stretching , massage and addressing minor injuries			0
inspiring veterans " almost every player on tour is hurt or dealing with some sort of minor injury			0
however , players have all become great at managing these niggles			2
" @entity49 takes inspiration from the likes of @entity230 -- " playing some of his best tennis in his mid thirties " -- not to mention the 32 - year - old @entity21 , who is the long - time president of the @entity231			1
@entity49 is a vice president on the 10 - member board and the group meet about half a dozen times a year to address issues such as prize money , draw sizes and the tour calendar			0
player " burn out " has been a hot topic in recent years , making attention to diet and fitness all the more important with the increased demands placed on them			2
" players are taking their health very seriously , " said @entity16			1
" fitness programs have reached new standards and along with that players ' diets have become very healthy			2
" i have n't seen actual chefs with players yet , but i have seen nutritionists who are getting the food for the player out late at night buying specific products that they want to have in their players ' body the next day			0
modern trend " and a physiotherapist is often in charge , making sure you have the protein shakes right after the match and also a specific diet that has probably been pre-arranged by a chef or nutritionist			1
" tennis is not alone in this obsession with fueling the body with the right stuff			0
" i think this is a trend in all sports though			0
i hear @entity280 is a vegetarian and @entity281 ( @entity282 ) takes incredible care of his body , " said @entity16			2
at 39 and 35 years of age respectively , the @entity286 basketball stars serve as a powerful reminder that careers can be prolonged in the most demanding of sports by taking care what you eat .			0
