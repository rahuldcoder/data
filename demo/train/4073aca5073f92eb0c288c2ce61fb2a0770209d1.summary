once at a party , " @entity0 told @entity5 , " and i 'm assuming he was in a bad mood , because he was n't the friendliest guy in the world			1
" the @entity11 veteran spoke candidly to the @entity1 host about @entity3 , @entity13 , battles with " @entity17 " executive producer @entity15 , fatherhood , becoming a grandfather , toning down his bad boy ways , and more			2
" he was rude to you ? " asked @entity5			2
i 'm sure people have said that about me from time to time ; not too often , though , because i 'm pretty approachable			2
" @entity0 recalled that the encounter occurred about five or six years ago			1
" i said , ' mr. @entity3 , i 'm sorry to bother you			2
' i think he was talking to @entity25			2
and i said ' i 'm @entity0			1
i just want to shake your hand			2
' and he said ' that 's nice			2
' " @entity5 asked @entity0 what he thought about @entity3 's doping admission , and @entity0 opened up about his own struggles with drug use and public image			1
" the reason i 've been forgiven for a lot of my stuff , " said @entity0 , " is because there 's always been a feeling of honesty and the guy that at least was trying to do the right thing			1
" decades ago , @entity0 admitted that he took steroids back in 1988 when he was working on the film " @entity46			1
and i stopped , " said @entity0 , who noted the steroids ' adverse affects			1
" it made me crazy			2
it made me insane and angry and picking fights in bars , you know			2
but it also gave me , in the final couple of weeks of the shooting , the energy i needed to keep going			0
" @entity0 did say that steroids did not allow him to hit a baseball any better			1
" it may give you extra legs deep in the season , but you still have to have that @entity66 - given ability to hit the ball , " he said			0
a self - professed " baseball player at heart , " @entity0 admitted to @entity5 that his dream career would be to play for the @entity70			1
" i do n't know that i had the skills to play professionally , " admitted @entity0			1
" i probably would have been riding a bus in @entity75 until i was like 35			0
" @entity0 has not spoken to @entity15 since he was very publicly fired by the " @entity17 " executive producer			1
" i think we were in the same hotel lobby one night and missed each other by about 10 minutes , " said the actor			0
" what would you have said if you had bumped into him ? " asked @entity5			0
" i 'd have walked right up to him and said ' @entity84 , good luck with everything			0
sorry about that and see you on campus			0
' @entity89 ' gets 90 - episode renewal however , @entity0 noted that " the fantasy is walking up and dropping him , but that 's not who i am			1
it 's not who i am			0
you know , i 'm not a violent guy			0
" " do you harbor resentment toward him ? " asked @entity5			0
" i just wish that he would acknowledge , at some point , that he had a hand in it			0
he did put out a statement			0
the timing was perfect for him , actually , because nothing is organic			0
it 's always a little bit manufactured			0
" @entity0 also admitted that there are " parts " of @entity15 that he misses			1
" when i look back at the pilot of ' @entity113 , ' it was an absolute gem			1
and i almost agreed to do that show based on his enthusiasm and his track record without seeing a script			0
and what i said to him , ' what are you going to call it ? ' and when he said , " @entity17 , " i knew it was a hit			0
" @entity0 's opinion on the show , post his own departure , has changed			1
" they downloaded their anchor , " he said			2
" they cut off their anchor and they went adrift			2
and i think you do n't realize how important your anchor is until you do n't have it , you know			1
" @entity5 asked @entity0 to elaborate on how he feels about his " @entity17 " replacement , @entity138			1
" he 's a terrific young man and he 's doing a great job with what they 've given him ... he should be really grateful ... " @entity0 did laud his former co-star @entity142 's comedic skills , however , calling the @entity145 winning actor " a genius			1
" @entity0 also set the record straight on the $ 100,000 he gave to @entity13			1
the pair were set to work together on " @entity150 " and , according to @entity0 , producers gave @entity13 $ 100,000 less than what he thought she was going to be paid , so the actor simply made up the difference			1
" and was she grateful ? " asked @entity5			0
" eventually , yes , absolutely			0
yes ... it was n't like right off the bat , though			2
" @entity5 noted that @entity13 similarly underwent a pattern of drug and alcohol abuse not unlike @entity0 's			1
" can you actually , even you , give somebody like that advice ? " asked @entity5			0
" @entity161 is it , in the end , the look in the mirror and work it out for yourself ? " " if she 'd asked me questions about some of my own stuff , " said @entity0 , " i would have gladly given her advice but she did n't			1
and i found that interesting			0
maybe she did n't want to bother me or did n't want to pry			2
" @entity0 expanded on the demons associated with fame , drugs and excess			1
" it 's a similar garment that we 're all wearing , yes , " he said			0
" i think fame has a lot to do with it and i think excess has a lot to do with it ... not so much excess but access -- access to anything with a phone call at any point , day or night , it does n't matter ... it can become a nightmare ... at first ... it 's radical and it 's everything that you thought it was going to be ... and then it 's not			1
and that turns on a dime			0
and suddenly there 's an emptiness			2
" @entity0 , 47 , who has largely toned down his hard - partying ways , will become a grandfather this year			1
his 28 - year - old daughter from a previous relationship is due to give birth in september			0
" i knew it was going to happen eventually , " said @entity0 , " ... but i did n't know it would be this soon and it 's none of my business when she chose to do that , you know			1
so i 've just got to be along for the ride and celebrating and just cheering her along and giving her whatever she needs			0
" @entity0 had four other children : two girls with ex-wife @entity213 and twin boys with ex-wife @entity215			1
" i put everybody in my neighborhood , which is my ultimate master plan , " said @entity0			1
" i put @entity213 and the girls in one house , @entity221 and the boys in the other , and we 're all behind the same gate			0
" @entity0 said his ex-wives get along great and babysit one another 's children			1
" it is pretty civilized , " he said			0
" we just keep everybody paid and they 'll be happy			0
" @entity5 asked @entity0 what bit of advice he would pass along to his two sons			1
" lead with the truth , " said @entity0			2
" that 's what i 've always done			0
that 's what my dad told me			0

on ' men ' today : " i think you do n't realize how important your anchor is until you do n't have it "
fame and excess " everything that you thought it was going to be " followed by " emptiness "
