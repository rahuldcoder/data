@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 proposed high - level talks with the @entity7 to " ease tensions in the @entity9 , " its state news agency reported early sunday			1
the topics that " can be sincerely discussed " include easing military tensions , changing a truce treaty to a peace treaty and nuclear matters , according to a statement from the @entity5 's @entity16 , as reported by the state - run @entity17			1
it left some details -- like where and when the talks might be held -- up to @entity22 , and insisted @entity7 officials should not lay out any preconditions for talks			0
" ( the @entity7 should ) not lose the opportunity that is laid out and should actively agree with our resolute step and good intention , " the commission said			0
for years , @entity5 has been at odds with many in the international community , including the @entity7 , over its missile and nuclear programs			2
whether @entity37 's offer is accepted -- and if so , on what terms -- and whether the talks happen remains to be seen			0
last tuesday , @entity5 called off what were supposed to be the first high - level talks between @entity5 and @entity1 officials in years			1
that meeting was supposed to start the next day			0
high - level talks between @entity45 called off @entity1 's unification ministry said the @entity5 dropped out after a dispute about who should be involved in the talks , after both sides contended that the other was n't sending a sufficiently high - level official to the delegation the talks were to focus on , among other things , reviving joint economic activities			1
amid a spike in tensions , the @entity5 in april halted activity at the @entity60 , a shared industrial complex and major symbol of cooperation between the two countries			0
@entity5 removes missiles from launch site , @entity7 official says it was not immediately clear what might be on the agenda if @entity7 and @entity5 officials meet			0
@entity22 has been at the forefront of those demanding an end to its nuclear program , pushing for sanctions and rallying other nations to their side			0
tensions in and around the @entity9 surged in december -- one year after @entity79 assumed power after his father 's death -- when @entity5 launched a long - range rocket then conducted an underground nuclear test two months later			2
adm. @entity85 , the top @entity7 commander in the @entity86 , said in april that @entity5 's missile and weapons programs posed " a clear and direct threat to @entity7 national security and regional peace and stability			1
" why @entity5 intelligence is so hard to read that same month , @entity5 set out demanding conditions for talks			0
they included calling for the withdrawal of @entity99 sanctions against it and a permanent end to joint @entity7 - @entity1 military exercises			0
the @entity7 and @entity1 " should immediately stop all their provocative acts against the @entity5 and apologize for all of them , " the @entity5 's @entity16 said in a statement carried by state - run media , using the shortened version of @entity5 's official name , the @entity5			1
but those talks never came to be , with @entity1 foreign ministry spokesman @entity111 describing the @entity5 's demands as " preposterous			1
" the @entity7 has said that , in order for it to engage in talks , @entity5 would have to show a serious commitment to moving away from its nuclear program			1
if it happens , this will be the second senior - level talks between the @entity7 and @entity5 since @entity79 took power			2
the first talks were in february 2012 , when @entity5 's first vice minister , @entity121 , held talks in @entity123 with @entity124 , the @entity7 envoy for @entity5 policy			1
at the time , , @entity5 agreed to stop nuclear activity at its main facility in @entity128 and impose a moratorium on nuclear tests and long - range missile launch in exchange for 240,000 tons of food assistance			0
however , the agreement fell apart after a @entity99 sanction in response to @entity5 's failed long - range rocket launch in april 2012 .			2
