in july 2012 , responding to allegations that the video - chat service @entity2 -- owned by @entity4 -- was changing its protocols to make it possible for the government to eavesdrop on users , corporate vice president @entity0 took to the company 's blog to deny it			1
turns out that was n't quite true			2
or at least he -- or the company 's lawyers -- carefully crafted a statement that could be defended as true while completely deceiving the reader			2
you see , @entity2 was n't changing its protocols to make it possible for the government to eavesdrop on users , because the government was already able to eavesdrop on users			1
at a @entity25 hearing in march , director of national intelligence @entity26 assured the committee that his agency did n't collect data on hundreds of millions of @entity32			1
he was lying , too			0
he later defended his lie by inventing a new definition of the word " collect , " an excuse that did n't even pass the laugh test			1
as @entity41 's documents reveal more about the @entity43 's activities , it 's becoming clear that we ca n't trust anything anyone official says about these programs			1
@entity48 and @entity49 insist that the @entity43 has no " direct access " to their servers			1
of course not ; the smart way for the @entity43 to get all the data is through sniffers			1
@entity56 says it 's never heard of @entity57			2
of course not ; that 's the internal name of the @entity43 database			1
companies are publishing reports purporting to show how few requests for customer - data access they 've received , a meaningless number when a single @entity68 request can cover all of their customers			2
the @entity71 reported that @entity4 secretly worked with the @entity43 to subvert the security of @entity73 , something it carefully denies			1
even president @entity76 's justifications and denials are phrased with the intent that the listener will take his words very literally and not wonder what they really mean			2
@entity43 director gen. @entity83 has claimed that the @entity43 's massive surveillance and data mining programs have helped stop more than 50 terrorist plots , 10 inside the @entity32 do you believe him ? i think it depends on your definition of " helped			1
" we 're not told whether these programs were instrumental in foiling the plots or whether they just happened to be of minor help because the data was there			1
it also depends on your definition of " terrorist plots			0
" an examination ( @entity101 ) of plots that that @entity103 claims to have foiled since 9/11 reveals that would - be terrorists have commonly been delusional , and most have been egged on by @entity103 undercover agents or informants			0
left alone , few were likely to have accomplished much of anything			0
both government agencies and corporations have cloaked themselves in so much secrecy that it 's impossible to verify anything they say ; revelation after revelation demonstrates that they 've been lying to us regularly and tell the truth only when there 's no alternative			1
there 's much more to come			2
right now , the press has published only a tiny percentage of the documents @entity41 took with him			0
and @entity41 's files are only a tiny percentage of the number of secrets our government is keeping , awaiting the next whistle - blower			1
@entity133 once said " trust but verify			2
" that works only if we can verify			0
in a world where everyone lies to us all the time , we have no choice but to trust blindly , and we have no reason to believe that anyone is worthy of blind trust			2
it 's no wonder that most people are ignoring the story ; it 's just too much cognitive dissonance to try to cope with it			1
this sort of thing can destroy our country			0
trust is essential in our society			0
and if we ca n't trust either our government or the corporations that have intimate access into so much of our lives , society suffers			1
study after study demonstrates the value of living in a high - trust society and the costs of living in a low - trust one			0
rebuilding trust is not easy , as anyone who has betrayed or been betrayed by a friend or lover knows , but the path involves transparency , oversight and accountability			0
transparency first involves coming clean			0
not a little bit at a time , not only when you have to , but complete disclosure about everything			0
then it involves continuing disclosure			0
no more secret rulings by secret courts about secret laws			0
no more secret programs whose costs and benefits remain hidden			0
oversight involves meaningful constraints on the @entity43 , the @entity103 and others			1
this will be a combination of things : a court system that acts as a third - party advocate for the rule of law rather than a rubber - stamp organization , a legislature that understands what these organizations are doing and regularly debates requests for increased power , and vibrant public - sector watchdog groups that analyze and debate the government 's actions			1
accountability means that those who break the law , lie to @entity206 or deceive the @entity32 people are held accountable			0
the @entity43 has gone rogue , and while it 's probably not possible to prosecute people for what they did under the enormous veil of secrecy it currently enjoys , we need to make it clear that this behavior will not be tolerated in the future			1
accountability also means voting , which means voters need to know what our leaders are doing in our name			0
this is the only way we can restore trust			0
a market economy does n't work unless consumers can make intelligent buying decisions based on accurate product information			0
that 's why we have agencies like the @entity232 , truth - in - packaging laws and prohibitions against false advertising			1
in the same way , democracy ca n't work unless voters know what the government is doing in their name			1
that 's why we have open - government laws			2
secret courts making secret rulings on secret laws , and companies flagrantly lying to consumers about the insecurity of their products and services , undermine the very foundations of our society			0
since the @entity41 documents became public , i have been receiving e-mails from people seeking advice on whom to trust			2
as a security and privacy expert , i 'm expected to know which companies protect their users ' privacy and which encryption programs the @entity43 ca n't break			1
the truth is , i have no idea			0
no one outside the classified government world does			0
i tell people that they have no choice but to decide whom they trust and to then trust them as a matter of faith			2
it 's a lousy answer , but until our government starts down the path of regaining our trust , it 's the only thing we can do .			1

@entity281 : government officials lied to us that the state does n't collect our data
@entity281 : it 's clear that we ca n't trust anything anyone says about the @entity43 programs
he says corporations have gone along with government in hiding the truth from us
@entity281 : too much secrecy has robbed people of their trust in government
