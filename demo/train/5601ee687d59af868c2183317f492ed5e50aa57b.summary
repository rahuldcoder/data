@entity0 -- a verbal flash - fire erupted on the @entity4 floor thursday night over nine - year battle to pass a benefits bill for emergency workers who were first on the scene of the 9/11 attacks			0
frustrated with @entity11 votes against the $ 7.4 billion measure because @entity13 suspended the rules to prevent them from offering unrelated amendments -- and at the same time requiring a two - thirds majority to pass -- @entity13 rep. @entity17 excoriated the minority party			1
" it 's @entity11 wrapping their arms around @entity11 rather than doing the right thing on behalf of the heroes , " @entity17 said during an impassioned , 90 - second speech			1
" it is a shame			0
a shame ! if you believe this is a bad idea to provide health care -- then vote no ! but do n't give me the cowardly view that ' oh , if it was a different procedure			1
' " the bill failed to get the 291 votes it needed for passage , polling just 255 votes			0
but that 255 votes easily surpassed the 218 needed for a simple majority			1
@entity13 @entity38 rep. @entity37 -- the sponsor of the bill who has been working on the legislation since just after terrorist attacks -- is working to convince her party 's leadership to hold a simple majority vote before the ninth anniversary of the attacks			1
she told @entity1 friday that passing the bill under suspension rules was " a very high bar			0
" " my goal is to have it on the floor again under regular rule , majority rule , which would require only 218 votes			1
we clearly had the 218 votes to pass it , " @entity58 said			0
@entity62 rep. @entity61 , another @entity11 , opposed the legislation on the basis of cost			0
he called the bill an " irresponsible overreach " that " does not contain the necessary protections to safeguard taxpayer dollars from abuse , waste and fraud			0
" " i think this is another example of the @entity13 ' insatiable appetite for the taxpayers ' hard - earned dollars , " @entity61 said thursday night on the @entity4 floor			2
but rep. @entity77 , @entity78 - @entity38 -- who actually voted in favor of the bill -- tipped the debate in another direction , focusing on the @entity13 tactic that kept the @entity11 from offering up an amendment on illegal immigration			1
" but what we are doing tonight is a cruel hoax and a charade , " @entity77 said from the @entity4 floor , every bit as passionately as @entity17 would moments later			1
" everyone knows that this bill will not get the two - thirds majority required on the suspension calendar			0
everyone also knows that this bill would pass with a clear majority if the @entity99 leadership would allow it to come to the floor under the regular procedures of the @entity4			0
" the reason @entity102 is not being brought up under regular order is because the majority party is petrified of having its members face a potential vote on illegal immigration , " he said			1
" you can blame it on the @entity11 -- and i 've been strongly critical on the @entity11 position on this issue -- but the reality is you could pass this bill if you wanted to			0
" @entity77 's words set off @entity17			1
" it takes great courage to wait until all members have already spoken and then stand up and wrap your arms around procedure , " @entity17 began			2
" we see it in the @entity122 every single day when members say , ' we want amendments			0
we want amendments , but we 're still a ' no. '' and then we stand up and say , ' oh , if only we had a different process , we 'd vote yes			2
" you vote yes if you believe yes , " he said			0
" you vote in favor of something if you believe it 's the right thing			0
if you believe it 's the wrong thing , you vote no. '' @entity77 tried to interject , but @entity17 refused to yield the floor			1
" the gentleman gets up and yells , trying to intimidate people into believing he 's right -- he is wrong ! " @entity17 shouted			2
" the gentleman is wrong ! the gentleman is providing cover for his colleagues rather than doing the right thing ! " " i will not stand here and listen to my colleague say , ' oh , if only i had a different procedure that allows us to stall , stall , stall and then vote no. ' instead of standing up and defending your colleagues and voting no on this humane bill , you should urge them to vote yes , something the gentleman has not done , " @entity17 concluded , punctuating his final words with an index finger in the air			1
@entity77 told @entity1 friday that if the bill went to simple majority vote he " would sit with the @entity13 all day and defend the bill against the @entity11			1
" @entity17 defended his outburst and acknowledged that many people are unhappy with what they see as partisan bickering in @entity163 , but he said that many people may not understand what 's actually happening			2
suspending the rules for certain votes , he said , " is a common procedure ... used all the time			2
" " frankly , it was beyond a lot of people 's understanding why anyone would want to politicize this and make it a long , drawn - out fight , " he told @entity1 .			0
