@entity0 has been an enigma since his name first emerged as a possible leader of the @entity5 terrorist attack that killed four @entity6			1
he did n't hide in the months after the september 11 , 2012 , assault on a @entity6 diplomatic compound , instead giving media interviews in public , including one with @entity11 's @entity10			1
" no problem , " he replied in 2013 when @entity12 asked if he would be willing to meet with @entity6 investigators presumably searching for him			2
" but not as an interrogation , " he added , suggesting instead " a conversation , like the one we are having with you now			0
" it did n't work out that way			0
more than a year later , @entity6 special forces nabbed @entity0 in a weekend mission near @entity5 , the @entity23 administration announced tuesday			1
under questioning instead of the conversation he proposed , @entity0 is being questioned before his transfer to the @entity6 to face charges in the @entity5 attack			1
" as a general rule , the government will always seek to elicit all the actionable intelligence and information we can from terrorist suspects taken into our custody , " said @entity32 spokeswoman @entity31			0
the @entity42 - led @entity41 team , which also includes @entity43 and military intelligence members , typically conducts such intelligence interviews			0
on tuesday , a federal judge unsealed charges filed last year that accuse @entity0 of killing a person in the course of an attack on a federal facility with a firearm and a dangerous weapon , and of attempting and conspiring to provide material support to terrorists resulting in death			1
the charges , filed in @entity58 in @entity59 , also accuse him of discharging , brandishing , using , carrying and possessing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence			0
former prisoner under @entity65 believed to be in his early 40s , @entity0 emerged from years in prison under the regime of former @entity68 leader @entity65 to form an @entity70 militia and later became associated with @entity71 , a group @entity6 officials blamed for the 2012 attack that killed ambassador @entity75 and three others			1
coming in the midst of a @entity6 presidential campaign , the assault ignited a political firestorm			2
@entity82 critics of president @entity23 and then - secretary of state @entity83 seized on the vulnerability of the @entity6 compound on the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks to accuse the administration of failing to provide proper security			2
they also alleged a politically inspired coverup when former @entity92 ambassador @entity91 , now @entity23 's national security adviser , went on sunday talk shows a few days later and blamed the unrest on spontaneous protests against an @entity98 video made in @entity6			1
such protests occurred in other @entity101 region cities that day , but @entity6 officials later acknowledged the @entity5 attack was an organized assault instead of simply a spur - of - the - moment demonstration that spiraled out of control			1
@entity106 said tuesday in a town hall - style event broadcast on @entity11 that she hoped @entity0 's capture would bring answers to some of the lingering questions over what happened in @entity5			1
" we want to know who was behind it , what the motivation of the leaders and attackers were , " she said , attributing the lingering lack of information today in part to the " fog of war " in @entity119			0
" we tried to control traffic " in his interview with @entity11 's @entity12 , @entity0 offered little explanation for what happened or his exact role			1
" i did n't know where the place was , " he said , aided by a translator			0
" when i heard , we went to examine the situation			0
when we withdrew and there was shooting with medium guns and there were @entity139 's in the air and people panicked , we tried to control traffic			0
" a @entity144 investigation cited multiple witnesses in @entity5 who described @entity0 as playing a leading role in the attack			1
in the @entity11 interview , @entity12 asked if anyone from the @entity6 or @entity68 government tried to get in touch with @entity0 afterward , and he responded : " never			1
" to @entity12 , @entity0 sounded confident at the time , rather than like someone facing an international investigation			0
he also made clear his sentiments on @entity155 , the terrorist network linked to @entity71 , which means " supporters of @entity157			2
" " @entity155 is not something to be afraid of , " he said			2
" @entity155 is people who are devout about protecting their religion and their people			2
" what took so long ? his public appearances last year and the subsequent months that passed until his capture caused @entity82 critics to question what took so long			0
they hope to use the @entity5 issue against @entity106 , the overwhelming favorite for the @entity172 presidential nomination if she decides to run			2
asked tuesday about why it took so long to get @entity0 , @entity175 spokesman rear adm. @entity174 said the important thing was that the mission accomplished its goal with no @entity6 casualties			2
he and other officials have emphasized that building a criminal case against a terror suspect for an attack in a foreign country is challenging and takes time			0
a law enforcement source also told @entity11 that @entity0 went into hiding following media interviews he gave last year			1
" what matters is not that it took a matter of time to get him , but that we got him , " @entity174 said			0
" and i ca n't speak for his living habits			0
but let 's just say for argument 's sake he was living in plain sight			0
" captured key @entity5 suspect will face @entity6 criminal courts what to know about the consulate attacks timeline of the @entity5 attacks slain ambassador died ' trying to help build a better @entity119 ' @entity207 , online gaming maven among @entity5 dead			1

@entity210 denied to @entity11 last year that he led the @entity5 attack
he was *imprisoned* under @entity65 , then formed an @entity70 militia
do n't fear @entity155 , he told @entity11 's @entity10
he is being brought to the @entity6 to face charges
