-- when trash disappears into the dumpster , where does it go ? a straightforward question for many of us , but in the @entity10 city of @entity11 there 's seldom a simple answer where garbage is concerned			2
that 's because the catadores ( trash collectors ) of the @entity18 cooperative are adept at transforming any old disused material into furniture , jewelry or even works of art. " i have two jobs , " explained 39 - year - old collector @entity24			1
" i go and collect the trash and then i transform it into art. i make small sofas , wooden benches , tables , and other plastic adornments			2
" " we have a phrase ( at @entity18 ) : ' o seu lixo e o meu luxo , ' ( roughly translated as ' your trash is our luxury , ' ) " he cheerily added			1
see also : @entity10 's middle class boom @entity39 like @entity24 are a familiar sight in towns and cities across @entity10 -- a motley collection of individuals who sift through mountains of street trash or landfill to locate paper , cans , bottles , metals and other types of recyclable materials			1
a 2010 estimate by the @entity57 ( @entity56 ) association stated that there were roughly one million catadores in @entity10 , although only a small number work officially for cooperatives and organizations like @entity18			1
many are the formerly homeless , ex-convicts or individuals who have stumbled upon hard times , selling what they find to recycling companies			0
arts and crafts in recent years , however , the cash return for many of @entity11 's catadores has become too inconsistent to ensure a stable income			2
the solution that asmare -- a professional group representing nearly 200 pickers -- came up with was to get creative with the one material they have plenty of -- trash			2
recruiting the help of local artists and volunteers , @entity18 has run an arts program for the best part of a decade where workers are taught how to transform the recyclable items they find during their daily collections			1
" the art center started with the purpose of us being able to make our own carts , and then for the catadores ' children to learn how to make crafts and other art pieces with the material collected , " said @entity90 , founder and president of @entity18			1
" the main benefits are the generation of employment and income for the catadores and their children			2
we ( have now ) started to implement the culture of ' garbage that is not garbage , ' " added the 63 - year - old , who has herself been a catadore since she was eight			0
see also : @entity10 's thriving @entity114 culture all items created at @entity18 are sold in a shop near the organization 's headquarters , with profits shared equally amongst the catadores			1
combining art sales and the money accumulated from selling on recycled materials , an @entity18 worker 's monthly income now averages out a respectable 1,700 @entity124 ( about $ 800 )			1
branching out yet although it was one of the first to introduce creative programs ( as well as claiming to be the first catadore cooperative in @entity10 ) , the @entity11 outfit is far from alone in its aesthetic endeavors			0
other organizations and artists have adopted similarly imaginative tactics in undertaking creative projects with catadores in recent years			2
in @entity138 , a street project called " @entity140 " has been adding colorful graffiti to the wooden carts used by many catadores since last summer			0
the 2010 @entity145 - nominated film @entity146 documented the catadores of @entity148 's now closed @entity150 landfill as they became subjects of works by the @entity10 artist @entity154			1
the artworks eventually sold for tens of thousands of dollars each			0
see also : does @entity10 deserve its b for @entity157 according to @entity158 , an artist who heads the @entity18 creative program , helping catadores to produce art is about much more than just the obvious financial or creative benefits			1
" in @entity10 the catadore is often discriminated against because of their origin , " @entity158 said			0
" therefore , linking art to recycling allows them to go to places that they have never been before and they end up having better acceptance because their creative work gives them a good visibility , " he added			0
recycling attitudes @entity158 also sees the potential to promote the possibilities of recycling across the country			0
" art through recycling aims to arouse people 's consciousness to think about what trash is or is not , " @entity158 said			1
" this new consciousness will help us to promote waste reduction			0
" when people see a recycled art piece , for instance , on a woman 's neck they may begin to understand that it is not ( just ) trash , " he added			2
see also : send us your favorite pictures of @entity10 this is something that @entity24 strongly agrees with			0
he points to what he has learned since he began the @entity18 program two years ago as an example of how attitudes to trash can change			1
" this experience has made me look at recycling in a different way , " he said			0
" there are materials that i used to throw away that now i keep , because i can already envision making some nice piece with it later			0
i do n't see the material only as trash anymore			0
