@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the village of @entity8 , in @entity6 's @entity5 state , villagers stand over a deadly and illegal weapon			1
nestled in a crater , the @entity11 - era cluster bomb failed to detonate			2
it was dropped a month ago , they say , and they do n't dare get any closer			0
across rocky outcrops , tennis ball - sized bomblets spilled out of the @entity20 - 500 model bomb and scattered everywhere			2
each of them is highly volatile and easily capable of blowing off a limb , or worse			0
the footage , obtained and verified by @entity2 , is damning new evidence that the @entity27 government is using cluster munitions in civilian areas			1
" cluster bombs are known to be indiscriminate and unreliable weapons			1
this is why they have been banned by international law , " said @entity32 , the director of the @entity33			1
" it is the humanitarian impact of these weapons that makes it so atrocious that @entity6 has used them			1
" the villagers in this part of @entity5 say they live in fear of the bombing raids by @entity27 airplanes that seem to happen almost daily			1
" today they bombed with their airplanes			0
they bombed up there in the mountains and they bombed close to here			0
today , " an @entity8 resident said			0
civilians in the @entity53 have resorted to hiding in rocky outcrops and caves , and piling stones over makeshift foxholes to take cover from the bombing raids			2
and cluster bombs present an even greater threat than regular munitions , rights groups say			1
" cluster munitions contain dozens or sometimes hundreds of explosive bomblets , so when they 're used , they scatter over a very large area , often the size of several football fields , " @entity32 said			1
anyone in the strike zone can be killed			0
and often , the greatest threat comes after the bombs are dropped			2
about 10 % of bomblets in modern cluster weapons usually fail , weapons experts say			1
but with older munitions like the @entity78 , that percentage can be much higher			2
the cluster bomblets become a minefield			1
and while mines are dangerous because they are invisible , volatile cluster bombs are deadly because they lie in plain sight			1
often , they attract children			2
" [ the bombs ] can land in fields , in homes , in villages , and of course it poses a risk to civilians , " said @entity86 , regional director of the @entity87 , a humanitarian organization that helps solve problems related to leftover ordnance			1
" civilians do not recognize what is a bomblet -- dangerous and highly explosive -- and what is a toy			2
so you see a lot of curious children after these raids go out and identify these new and exiting objects and blow their hands and heads off			0
" @entity6 is fighting a bitter conflict against the @entity108 , a rebel group that wants to be part of independent @entity6			2
the rebels depend on local villages for food			0
the @entity27 military strategy seems clear : it aims to terrify and starve the civilians into leaving the area			1
it appears to be working			0
thousands of villagers have fled to camps like @entity120 , where humanitarian agencies have struggled to feed and shelter them			0
the @entity124 refugee agency says more than 500 arrive every day			0
this latest evidence of cluster munitions in @entity5 suggests that the @entity27 military is stepping up its campaign , but a @entity27 army spokesman flatly denied that they use cluster munitions			1
" we do n't use cluster munitions in @entity5 , we have no ties to such weapons , " military spokesman @entity132 told @entity2			1
" there is no need to use these kinds of weapons to begin with , the fighting is in open space , the renegades do n't have concrete fortifications			0
" @entity132 added that the footage could have been taken anywhere			0
but @entity2 knows that the footage was taken in @entity8 village			0
and this would n't be the first time that @entity6 has been accused of dropping the highly controversial weapons			2
the @entity87 says that it still finds @entity152 - made pm - 1 bomblets throughout @entity6 , particularly in the areas between @entity154 , the capital , and the @entity156 border			1
the munitions were dropped during the long civil war between the @entity159 that ended in 2005			0
military analysis and logic suggests that since the @entity108 in the @entity5 had no significant airpower , and they were unlikely to drop bombs on themselves , the cluster munitions came from @entity27 warplanes @entity6 has frequently denied ever using cluster munitions and has not signed the convention to ban the weapon			1
the country has promised to sign up " as soon as possible			0
" since 2008 , more than 100 nations have signed the convention			0
" it 's not surprising in a way that @entity6 denies the use of these weapons , even though they are so stigmatized and rejected by the international community			1
no country wants to be associated with these weapons , whether they 've signed onto the ban or not , " @entity32 said .			0

cluster munitions scatter bomblets that can be especially dangerous to children
international law bans such bombs , but @entity6 has yet to sign on
civilians in @entity6 's @entity5 state say planes have used them
a spokesman denies that the @entity27 army uses cluster munitions
