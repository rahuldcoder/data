-- @entity2 's self - immolation one year ago was an act which symbolized the frustration and desperation of millions in the @entity7 world , setting into motion a series of revolutions across the @entity11 and @entity12			1
his was a cry for dignity , justice , and opportunity , which continues to be heard around a region undergoing tumultuous change			1
in today 's @entity11 , people matter			1
many are now engaged in what could be a life - long struggle to fight long - standing grievances and take greater control of their lives			1
this process must involve the creation of new democratic political systems , which ensure greater accountability of leaders , and level the playing field of opportunity for all , not just a select few			1
it has been a remarkable year			0
three dictators have been toppled and one has transferred power to a deputy			0
nonetheless , analysts and policy - makers continue to speak about the slow pace of change in the region and warn of the onset of an " @entity44			1
" such distinctions -- spring and winter -- are misleading			0
many seasons will come and go in the transformative years that lie ahead for the @entity7 world			0
revolutions take time to settle			1
the transformation of societies takes even longer			0
the colored revolutions of @entity53 , two decades on , are still developing			1
it took centuries for democratic systems to be refined in @entity53			2
we can not expect democracy in the @entity11 to be solidified in only one year			1
still , across the region , there is cause for concern			2
@entity64 's transition to civilian rule carries major worries , even as @entity64 continue to go to the polls			2
the concern remains that the ruling military council will relinquish power only under heavy pressure ; and @entity64 's economy and confidence are in nosedive as the populace awaits civil rule			2
@entity77 meanwhile face a regime intent on killing and torturing its citizens to end their uprising			0
all this as a largely impotent international community argues over how to stop the increasing violence			0
in @entity85 , many are not convinced by a regionally brokered transition deal , which allows @entity87 and his family immunity from prosecution as well as continued political influence			0
@entity91 continues to reel from the absence of a genuine national dialogue between its rulers and the underrepresented and relatively impoverished majority @entity96 community			0
@entity99 's revolutionaries now face the immediate challenge of building a state from scratch , based on the rule of law and democratic principles			1
to do so , they are learning , they will first have to put down their guns			0
link : @entity107 swears in new president while events elsewhere in the region have been less dramatic , the desire for change is still palpable			1
under popular pressure , @entity113 now has an elected prime minister under a revised constitution ; @entity118 's king has been forced to change the government twice this year ; @entity121 's @entity120 has devolved some powers to his consultative council			2
only time will tell if people accept these changes as going far enough to meet their rising expectations			0
as the respected @entity7 commentator @entity128 somewhat prophetically predicted last year , we are witnessing the " birth of @entity7 politics			2
" for the first time , people have a voice and the opportunity to launch new parties and institutions , independent of the autocratic rulers and external interference that long stifled political development			0
civil society organizations , the " software " of any democratic system , have mushroomed in transitional states such as @entity64 and @entity107			1
a truly democratic and accountable political culture is finally developing in the region			1
undoubtedly , the biggest political winners over the past year have been @entity148 parties , particularly the @entity150 movement			0
as real @entity7 politics emerges , this is not surprising			0
one should accept that today , the center of gravity of the region 's societies ' is religiously pious , socially conservative , and economically liberal			1
the rise of the @entity150 and the more fundamentalist @entity160 parties is a natural legacy of years of political exclusion , and economic corruption and stagnation			2
as the @entity166 looks on , it should be remembered that a faith - inspired vision led to the establishment of the @entity171 state itself			2
the challenge for the @entity150 will be to maintain their popularity and their discipline while meeting the demands of not just their supporters but of an entire nation			0
the wiser leaders among them may be realizing that winning at the ballot box , even exercising majority rule , does not entitle them to ignore their responsibilities to the minorities that may fear them			0
@entity190 's cry for the rights and responsibilities of all citizens provides a lesson that these new political actors and leaders would do well to heed			2
in this changed environment , international actors need to tread wisely			0
as regional and international participants in a recent @entity203 seminar in @entity204 concluded , @entity200 governments must embrace a wholesale reassessment of their foreign policies towards the region			2
this reassessment should reflect a " paradigm shift " towards genuinely inclusive and equal partnerships with the @entity11 that do not seek to dictate democratic outcomes			1
above all , people speaking for the first time must not be met with deaf ears			0
western countries ' engagement with newly emerging @entity148 actors , then , should be based on the principles of mutual respect and establishing two - way communication			1
link : many similarities in @entity223 , @entity224 chaos such a dialogue should also acknowledge the sorry legacy of past regimes that were considered key allies			2
under the reign of such rulers , there was a mass campaign of victimization , torture , and marginalization against liberals and @entity237 alike who posed a threat			0
while affected societies have established their own judicial processes to take their former leaders to task , it is also time for @entity200 countries to acknowledge the pain and dislocation of those who suffered at the hands of these regimes			0
as certain dictators in the region continue to hound their people , the international community must not make the same mistakes again			0
when acts of brutality -- tantamount even to crimes against humanity -- are being perpetrated , as in @entity77 , the international community must act based on its responsibility to protect innocent civilians , and face down this evil			0
ultimately , the region needs to find its own state - builders and create new states that reflect the will of their people			1
what has become clear over the past year is that the people of the @entity11 and @entity12 are in no mood to give up their search for justice and dignity			1
it is fitting that one - year after @entity273 's desperate act , @entity107 will see the election and appointment of a president and prime minister -- one liberal , the other @entity148 - both human rights activists imprisoned by the previous regime			1
@entity2 's true legacy may be the birth of a new democratic @entity107 where a wholly unique model of governance is emerging -- one in which @entity237 and secularists govern and where political activists who have been imprisoned for their views now sit in government			1
the new @entity107 , not @entity289 , @entity53 , or even @entity290 , will be the real model for the newly emerging @entity7 world			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity295 .			1

@entity107 @entity2 self - immolated *catalyzing* a series of revolutions across @entity11 and @entity12
@entity11 expert : @entity302 's legacy may be birth of new democratic @entity107
@entity295 : the unique form of governance emerging in @entity107 could be a model for whole region
