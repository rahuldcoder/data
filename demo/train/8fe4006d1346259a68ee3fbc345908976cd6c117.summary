@entity0 may be the " city that never sleeps " but that wo n't come as a shock to the @entity3 and @entity4 who are still new parents and are expecting another baby in april			1
@entity7 , now a toddler , would no doubt love the bright lights of the big city but he 'll have to wait to see them himself			2
a source close to the couple tells me the main reason he is n't coming is that the program of events " does n't make it appropriate to bring him			1
" this visit certainly feels rocket - propelled compared to the leisurely three - week tour of @entity22 and @entity23 earlier this year , when @entity7 did join his parents			2
on monday that will involve everything from a children 's craft group in @entity29 , a conservation reception with @entity31 and @entity32 , to an @entity34 game where they 're likely to rub shoulders with @entity36 and husband @entity37 on tuesday , their plans include a moment of reflection at the september 11 memorial and a glittering charity dinner at the @entity44 the couple will split at one point so that the heir to the throne can drop in on president @entity49 in @entity50 and give a speech at the @entity52			1
the @entity53 said @entity55 's visit underscored " the special relationship " between the @entity57 and the @entity58			1
" the president looks forward to thanking @entity55 for the hospitality shown to him by the @entity63 during the president 's recent visits to the @entity58 , " a spokesperson said in a statement			1
@entity55 and @entity4 will also have additional private engagements			1
each event has been carefully orchestrated to promote the couple 's own interests or those of the @entity58 government			2
royals are in the fund - raising business and if there 's anywhere you can make big money , it 's in the @entity77			0
the causes the royal couple support are set to benefit hugely from this trip			0
the @entity3 and @entity4 will meet the rich , the famous , the powerful and the vulnerable			1
no other couple in the world has the power to fill a room like the @entity85 can right now			0
their spokesman tells me : " the @entity3 and @entity4 are looking forward to their visit enormously , especially as neither have visited @entity0 or @entity50 in any capacity before			1
" they fondly remember the incredibly warm welcome they received on their last official visit to the @entity57 ( @entity96 in 2011 ) and are very much looking forward to returning to the @entity57			0
" that last visit was to sunny @entity98 at a time when people were still sizzling from the hype around the royal wedding			0
it was an unquestionable triumph			0
this time they will be returning to a bitter @entity105 winter but the welcome will no doubt be as warm			0
it may be reminiscent of princess @entity109 's first visit to @entity0			2
poignantly , @entity109 never came here with her husband @entity111			0
@entity4 and @entity55 are the next generation and very much a couple			1
wherever they go in @entity116 , the royals will be greeted by cameras and big crowds			0
@entity57 's fascination with this fairytale is unmatched			2
unlike @entity109 's day , many of the best royal moments come now from cell phones belonging to well - wishers			0
no doubt @entity4 will be asked how she is feeling after her bout of morning sickness -- with her entourage looking - on to make sure she does n't over do it .			1

@entity58 's prince @entity55 and @entity130 arrive in @entity0 for a *whirlwind* tour sunday

a source says the program of events in the city " does n't make it appropriate to bring him "
