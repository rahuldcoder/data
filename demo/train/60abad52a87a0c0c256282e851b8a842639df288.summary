-- @entity1 denies that it has used , or even possesses , chemical weapons , accusing the @entity3 and @entity4 of lying in order to pressure the embattled @entity7 government			1
@entity1 information minister @entity8 talked to @entity9 on friday , dismissing a claim by @entity3 officials a day earlier that they had evidence the chemical weapon sarin had been used in @entity1 on a small scale			1
" everything that the @entity3 minister and @entity4 government have said lack credibility , " @entity8 said			2
" it 's baseless , and it 's a new tactic to put political and economic pressure on @entity1			2
" @entity8 said the @entity1 government is the one that called for an investigation of an incident in which it claimed chemical weapons were used by " terrorist groups			1
" the government routinely labels rebel fighters as terrorists			0
@entity1 does not have chemical weapons and would not use them if it did , he said			1
the @entity3 " want to manipulate the issue , to let whoever used the chemical weapons ... get away ( with it ) , and to repeat the @entity38 example , " @entity8 said			1
after a meeting on friday with @entity42 's @entity41 , president @entity39 reiterated @entity3 " preliminary assessments " that " chemical weapons have been used on ... populations in @entity1			1
" he did n't backtrack from his earlier statements that it would be a " game changer " -- as far as how the world deals with @entity1 -- if it 's proven definitively that president @entity49 's forces used chemical weapons on his own people			1
still , @entity39 did n't specify what actions the @entity3 might take if that determination is made			2
for now , he said , the @entity3 is planning to continue its own " very vigorous investigation " and to work with its @entity56 allies and the @entity3			0
" we to have act prudently , " the president said			0
" ... but i think all of us , not just in the @entity3 but around the world -- recognize how we can not stand by and permit the systematic use of weapons like chemical weapons on civilian populations			1
" @entity67 , for one , is asking the @entity3 to take the lead in crafting a response to the evidence of chemical weapons			1
" i think the @entity3 , as the leader of the western world , should lead the efforts with our partners in @entity77 and @entity67 and to take action with what we 're seeing happening today in @entity1 , " @entity67 deputy defense minister @entity72 said on friday			2
opinion : @entity39 must act on @entity1 chemical weapons while he did n't offer specifics , @entity72 said that @entity67 military intelligence also has information indicating " @entity1 has used chemical weapons			1
" also friday , @entity87 @entity88 ban ki - moon asked the man heading the world body 's investigation into chemical weapons use in @entity1 to report to @entity87 headquarters on monday for " consultations , " a @entity87 spokesman said			1

" the secretary - general strongly urges the @entity1 government to respond swiftly and favorably so that this mission can carry out its work in @entity1			0
" @entity122 foreign ministry spokesman @entity120 responded friday by criticizing @entity88 's position as " nothing but a demonstration of a politicized approach			1
" " the inspection system proposed is analagous to that used at the end of the previous century in @entity38 , which -- unlike @entity1 -- was under @entity87 sanctions , " @entity120 said in a statement posted on the foreign ministry 's website			2
" it is difficult to understand why the @entity87 secretariat prefers to take its cue from those who care not about concrete steps to prevent attempts to use chemical weapons in the @entity1 crisis but to change the regime of a sovereign state			1
" earlier this week , the @entity122 foreign minister also warned against a repeat of the " @entity38 scenario " in which claims that @entity149 's government possessed so - called weapons of mass destruction were the basis of the @entity3 - led invasion			2
he also said that international investigators were asking " too much " by demanding access to all facilities in @entity1 and to have the right to interview any @entity1			0

" the @entity160 cautioned that the " chain of custody " of the chemicals was not clear and that intelligence analysts could not confirm the circumstances under which the sarin was used , including the role of @entity49 's regime			0
@entity4 prime minister @entity182 said that he supported @entity39 and that the use of chemical weapons should constitute a " red line , " the @entity4 @entity181 reported			1
but if a red line has been crossed , @entity182 was less clear on what the next steps should be			0
asked if the development could result in sending troops into @entity1 , @entity182 said he did n't want to see that			2
" but i think we can step up the pressure on the regime , work with our partners , work with the opposition in order to bring about the right outcome , " he said , according to the @entity181			0
" the question is how do we step up the pressure			0
and , in my view , what we need to do -- and we 're doing some of this already -- is shape that opposition , work with them , train them , mentor them , help them , so that we put the pressure on the regime and so what we can bring this to an end			0
