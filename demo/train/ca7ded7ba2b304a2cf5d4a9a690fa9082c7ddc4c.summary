-- when former @entity3 economist @entity2 first went to @entity4 after coining the acronym @entity6 , someone asked him whether he had included the " b " just to make the name sound good			1
such skepticism is becoming common again , as investors compare the projected rate of growth in @entity4 this year -- just 3 % -- to that in @entity14 and @entity15 , around 8 % and 6 % respectively			1
so does @entity4 still deserve to be seen as an economic powerhouse ? many would say no. @entity4 grew by less than 1 % in 2012 , the lowest of the @entity6 countries , and only 2.7 % in 2011			1
its problems are well known			0
it saves less than it invests , and 70 % of its growth comes from consumption			2
credit has risen dramatically over the last few years , but many families are now heavily indebted , which slows growth			1

@entity4 has become an expensive country , with a strong currency , and that has eroded the competitiveness of its industry			1
ten years ago around 50 % of exports were manufactured goods ; today the proportion is closer to 35 %			1
the tax burden is heavy , at around 35 % of @entity40 , especially in comparison to the quality of services the state provides , and government spending is rising faster than gdp			0
@entity4 's productivity grew by only 1.3 % between 1990 and 2010 , while @entity14 led the way at 8.3 % , followed by @entity15 at 4.7 % over the same period			1

inflation is pushing right up against the @entity56 's ceiling of 6.5 % per year			0
the balance of payments deficit is rising			0
infrastructure such as ports , roads , and airports is poor , and attempts to bring in the private sector to modernize some of it , such as with airports , have not been entirely successful			0
expensive electricity , an inadequately funded public sector pension system , and high interest rates round out this negative picture			2

the political system seems incapable of responding to these challenges			1
the state 's bureaucratic machinery is cumbersome and antiquated ; corruption is rife among politicians , and effective opposition to and debate about current policies almost non-existent			0
the current government is planning for president @entity85 's re-election in 2014 and there is a danger that it will postpone necessary adjustments , making a bad situation worse			0
so should we be talking about the @entity91 rather than @entity6 countries ? not really			1
there are three main sets of reasons why it is too early to count @entity4 out as a global economic player			1
the first has to do with fundamentals of its economy that are often ignored by short - term investors			0
@entity4 's economy has a higher per capita gdp than both @entity14 and @entity15 , and as a more mature economy , it is not surprising that its growth rate is slower			1

public debt as a percentage of @entity40 declined from about 60 % to 35 % of gdp between 2002 and 2012			0
international reserves are now $ 377 billion			0
@entity4 attracted around $ 62 billion in foreign direct investment in 2012 , making it the largest recipient of @entity117 in the world after @entity14 and the @entity119			1
all of these factors are reasons to be confident in the capacity of the @entity4 economy to continue to advance in an unspectacular but steady fashion			1
second , @entity4 has a number of enviable attributes			2
it has few threats to its security , meaning that it can afford to spend relatively little on national defence			0
@entity4 is alone among the @entity6 countries in not possessing nuclear weapons			1

it boasts a world - class agricultural sector that has not yet reached its potential			0
already the largest producer in the world of soy and beef , it has the capacity to adapt more crops to its tropical soils and develop its vast land frontier			0
in addition , @entity4 is becoming an environmental leader			2
its management of the @entity153 rainforest is crucial to the health of the planet , which is why the recent large reduction in the rate of deforestation has been so encouraging			0
it has some of the largest reserves of fresh water in the world			0
almost half of all energy coming from renewable sources , mainly hydroelectric but also biofuels			0
there is a third and final set of factors that make @entity4 stand out			2
together with @entity169 , and unlike @entity14 and @entity15 , @entity4 has reduced economic inequality in recent years			1
its @entity171 , a measure of income inequality , dropped from 0.63 to 0.52 from 1989 to 2009			0
between 2003 and 2011 , about 30 million @entity4 joined the so - called " new middle class , " earning between @entity173 and @entity174 per capita per month , and gaining access to formal sector employment , credit , and the country 's large consumer market			2
this reduction in inequality has a racial component , because 75 % of the new middle class is non-white			0
it also has a gender component -- formal sector employment for females has increased 136 % in the last twenty years			2
it is true that @entity4 's rate of economic growth is slow compared to @entity14 and @entity15			1
but so are the growth rates of most countries			0
@entity4 tends to be the focus of exaggerated analyses of its economy			2
if one looks past the superficial concern about growth at @entity4 's economic fundamentals , its resources , and the extraordinary social progress that the country has made in recent decades , it seems premature to remove the " b " from @entity6			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .			2

many are asking if @entity4 deserves to be seen as an economic powerhouse given its weak growth
over the last ten years @entity4 has benefited from a commodity boom , but that boom is slowing
the political system seems incapable of responding to these challenges
but it may be too early to count @entity4 out of the @entity6 club , @entity207 argues
