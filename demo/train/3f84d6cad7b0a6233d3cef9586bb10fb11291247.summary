@entity0 -- @entity2 added to his @entity4 legend friday night , winning the 100 - meter butterfly to capture his third gold medal of the @entity7 and the 17th of his career			1
already the most decorated @entity11 in history , @entity10 started off friday 's race -- which he has said will be his final individual @entity4 race , having promised to retire after this competition -- trailing several swimmers			2
but with basketball great @entity19 and prince @entity21 among those looking on , the @entity18 native charged ahead late to win by 0.23 seconds over @entity24 's @entity23 and @entity26 's @entity25 , who finished with an identical time			1
that margin , while slim , was still exponentially larger than when @entity10 captured gold in the same event at the @entity31			0
@entity10 won that race by .01 seconds by taking a quick , final stroke to catch a @entity35 swimmer gliding to the wall			2
" this one was i guess a bigger margin than the last two , so a step in the right direction , " @entity10 told @entity39 after his latest win			0
" it 's a pretty cool feeling			0
i have had a great week so far , and we have one more race tomorrow , " he added , referring to his final @entity4 race saturday as part of the @entity50 men 's 4x100 - meter medley relay team			1
@entity10 was n't the only @entity50 to make history in the pool friday			2
@entity55 , 17 , from @entity56 , @entity57 , earned her third gold medal , and fourth medal overall , in the women 's 200 - meter backstroke , smashing the world record in the process			1
" it does n't get any better than this , " @entity63 said to @entity39 about her victories in @entity0			0
" this has been the most incredible week , and i 've never been happier			0
" another @entity50 teenager , 15 - year - old @entity67 , also earned gold in impressive fashion , besting her nearest competitor by more than four seconds in the women 's 800 - meter freestyle			1
@entity73 's @entity72 , 21 , won the swimming competition 's fastest and , arguably , most glamorous event with a time of 21.34 ( just a shade off the @entity4 record ) in the men 's 50 - meter freestyle , his first ever @entity4 final			1
the @entity50 ' excellence at the @entity82 helped them pass @entity84 for the most gold medals , with 21 , on the seventh full day of the @entity7			1
the @entity50 have 43 medals total , compared with 42 for the @entity84			1
@entity87 also rocketed up the medal count chart friday , thanks to one of its athletes ' best days yet			0
the host nation captured three gold medals , bringing its total for the @entity7 to eight , just behind @entity96 for the fourth most of any country			0
the women 's double sculls team of @entity100 and @entity101 placed first in their competition , while the @entity103 excelled at the @entity104 for indoor cycling events			0
the men 's team pursuit title went to @entity87 , and in world record time			1
then , a short time later , @entity109 eked out a win by fractions of a second over a fast - charging competitor from @entity84 in the women 's keirin competition			1
@entity116 live : day six in tennis , @entity117 of @entity118 advanced to the gold - medal match in men 's singles , after beating @entity122 of @entity123 in a marathon four - hour , 26 - minute match			1
the legendary player 's final match does n't promise to be much easier , considering that the @entity0 crowd most likely will be rooting against him			0
that 's because @entity87 's own @entity130 secured a spot in the championship , after beating hard - hitting @entity35 @entity133 by a 7 - 5 , 7 - 5 score			1
@entity117 and @entity130 last matched up on the same court in july , when the 30 - year - old @entity118 won the @entity137 final in straight sets despite the exhortations of the home crowd , which included several members of the royal family			1
the women 's final , meanwhile , will pit @entity50 @entity145 and @entity26 's @entity146 after the two won semifinal matches friday in straight sets			1
both women are no strangers to the @entity151 court : @entity146 has won the iconic @entity137 tennis major once , while @entity145 has captured that championship five times , most recently just a few months ago			2
the @entity50 women 's football ( soccer ) team also moved to the semifinal round with a 2 - 0 win over @entity160			1
still , the biggest match of the day showcased two of the sport 's top teams in @entity165 and @entity166			0
reigning @entity168 champion @entity166 won 2 - 0 to advance to the next round			0
in judo , 16 - year - old @entity170 of @entity171 was allowed to compete wearing a headscarf but lost in her elimination match friday to @entity175 of @entity176 in 82 seconds			0
officials initially said they would not allow her to compete in the headscarf , but @entity170 's father and @entity171 officials insisted that she would not compete without it			0
@entity170 , who was competing in her first major international event , received a special invitation to compete from the @entity184			0
one of the most exciting contests friday may have mattered little in the medal count , though it provided a historic amount of drama			0
the women 's basketball teams from @entity87 and @entity73 finished their preliminary round game 's regulation tied at 67 , and the game looked set to go into a second overtime			2
but @entity73 's @entity196 hit a three - point shot with a fraction of a second left to propel her team to victory			2
and for the first time since the opening ceremony , @entity202 was buzzing friday with the start of track and field competition			0
athletes in action included @entity50 sprinter @entity210 , who won her first - round heat to move on to the semifinals of the 100 - meter sprint			1
she raced a few weeks after she sprinted to a tie with @entity215 in the @entity216			0
on the day of a scheduled runoff , @entity215 -- who is part of the @entity50 team as a member of the relay pool -- backed out			0
fellow @entity50 @entity222 posted the day 's best time in that race at 10.83 seconds , a full tenth of a second better than her next fastest foe			2
most of the track and field events friday were qualifiers , like the women 's sprint , but a few medals were handed out			2
@entity235 's @entity234 won gold in the shot put , just ahead of @entity239 's @entity238			1
@entity50 's @entity240 was third			2
and the women 's 10,000 - meter race ended with a climactic finish , as @entity245 's @entity244 pulled away from a pair of @entity248 runners for the win .			1

@entity2 wins the 100 - meter butterfly by 0.23 seconds for his third gold of games
including wins by @entity55 and @entity67 , the @entity50 tops @entity84 for overall golds
a @entity235 shot putter and @entity245 runner earn the first golds in track and field
@entity87 's @entity130 will face @entity117 in men 's tennis final at the @entity151
