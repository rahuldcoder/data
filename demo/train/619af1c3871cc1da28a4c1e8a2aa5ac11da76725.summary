-- it 's been a grueling campaign			2
you just want to sit down with a bowl of popcorn and find out who will be president for the next four years			0
so when will we know ? technically speaking -- who the heck can say ? with a race that went into @entity13 neck and neck , and plenty of questions about how key battleground states will play out , it 's reasonable to assume a long night is in store			1
what to watch for it could be even longer if the election ends up balanced on the edge of a razor - thin vote in @entity25 or if voting irregularities spark legal challenges in any of a number of critical states			2
either situation could drag out the decision until mid-november or even longer , analysts say			0
whatever happens , some indications should begin to trickle in now that the first waves of poll closings have come , ending voting in @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity25 and other key states			1
@entity41 states and @entity42 will stop voting at 11 p.m. et , and the last @entity43 will cast their ballots in @entity45 by 1 a.m. et wednesday			2
the first place to look : @entity37 , according to analysts			2
but the reporting of results was paused after 7 p.m. because many voters remained in line after the scheduled poll closing time , the state board of elections said			1
when results do come in , @entity55 will be a key indicator , @entity0 chief national correspondent @entity54 said			1
" one of the first things i 'll look at are the margins in the northern @entity37 suburbs closest to @entity60 , especially @entity55 , " he said			2
drama awaits in battleground states " if gov. @entity64 is ahead or at least in play there , it means @entity37 is in play , and we could have a long , competitive night , " @entity54 said			1
" if he 's not in play , it could be over before we even get to the @entity71			0
" @entity0 's chief politcal analyst , @entity72 , agreed that @entity37 will have a lot to say about what happens later			1
" we have to look at @entity75 in @entity37 , and if the president were to win @entity37 , obviously , the path to 270 is a lot easier for him , " she said			2
" but if @entity64 wins @entity37 , it could be a much longer night			2
" @entity0 political reporter @entity80 said that results from early and absentee balloting in @entity83 , @entity38 , could also offer a tantalizing glimpse of what the night may hold			1
@entity86 won the early and absentee vote in the slightly @entity89 - leaning county in 2008			0
if @entity86 comes up trailing when those early votes are posted soon after polls close , it could indicate the president might have trouble carrying @entity38 and its crucial electoral votes , according to @entity80			1
@entity96 : @entity43 voting system is a disgrace if @entity25 becomes key to the election , it 's possible that bag of popcorn is n't going to hold you			1
if the margin separating @entity64 and @entity86 is particularly thin , the election in that key battleground state could ride on absentee and provisional ballots			0
and that could keep the nation in suspense for a whopping 10 days			0
@entity25 provisional ballots hold key that 's how long @entity25 law gives poll workers to check the eligibility of provisional voters			1
@entity25 has one of the nation 's highest rates of provisional voting , with 211,000 cast in 2008 , according to @entity25 secretary of state @entity124			1
about 40,000 were later thrown out			0
@entity124 says he thinks the election in @entity25 will hinge on the state 's central counties , and the results will be known before midnight			1
" i really believe that we will be able to project a winner tonight , " he said			0
" i think that people will have to stay up past their bedtime to be able to do that			0
but it 's likely that we 'll know by the end of the evening			0
" popular - electoral split is possible the worst nightmare scenario is a redux of 2000 , when the nation suffered through weeks of uncertainty amid recounts and legal challenges surrounding the vote in @entity38			0
and , sorry to say it , as tightly contested as this race is , it is a possibility , analysts say			0
" between provisional balloting , absentee balloting and voting technology , i think there are untold different ways that this is a tense , contested election , " said @entity148 , co-director of the @entity149 at @entity150			0
" it 's pretty certain there 's going to be some litigation when this is over on november 6			0
" as we said -- who knows ? election 2012 : projections @entity0 's @entity165 contributed to this report .			1
