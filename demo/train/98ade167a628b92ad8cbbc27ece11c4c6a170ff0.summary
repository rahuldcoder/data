@entity0 , bath salts , herbal incense			2
they sound like something you might find on the fragrance aisle at @entity7 , but these are actually dangerous drugs masked as harmless fragrances , sold in convenience stores and online			1
innocent names such as mr. @entity13 hide the dangers			0
no one really knows what 's in these so - called synthetic drugs			1
manufacturers play a dangerous cat - and - mouse game with law enforcement by constantly changing the chemical compounds of the drugs to circumvent existing laws			1
teen recovers after smoking synthetic pot last week , @entity27 health authorities announced that they -- along with the federal @entity28 -- are investigating a rash of hospitalizations and three deaths believed to be the result of smoking synthetic marijuana			1
and real marijuana is legal in @entity27			0
@entity36 's @entity35 , who got exclusive access to a federal sweep of synthetic drugs earlier this year , spoke to @entity40 , a @entity41 official who oversees its synthetic drugs and chemicals section			1
@entity40 helped shed light on these manufactured drugs and why the @entity41 has stepped up its attempts to target those who sell these drugs and raise awareness about the dangers			1
here 's what you need to know : what exactly are synthetic drugs ? there is no exact definition , because the term is used to describe a wide range of chemical products that are ever - changing			1
synthetic marijuana and " bath salts " are the most common of these drugs , which are often sold as incense or plant food			1
unlike drugs such as marijuana and cocaine , these drugs do not come from plants ; they are manmade			1
synthetic marijuana consists of drug chemicals that are sprayed on plant materials and sometimes marketed as potpourri			1
while methamphetamine and @entity77 -- also known as " ecstasy " or " molly " -- are technically synthetic drugs because they are made entirely from chemicals , the term " synthetic drugs " usually refers to bath salts and synthetic marijuana that are often sold in stores and online as household items			1
when did they start appearing in the @entity86 and who 's using them ? these drugs first appeared in the @entity86 around 2009 , according to @entity40 , and they have since exploded in popularity , particularly among teenagers			1
" the biggest user population of these drugs are 12 - to 17 - year - olds , " @entity40 said			1
he believes they are popular among younger folks " because they are easily accessible , " whether it 's in a convenience store , a smoke shop or online			0
social media - savvy teens use the @entity103 to spread the word about where to find these drugs to -- as @entity40 explains -- " discuss the effects these substances had on their body			2
" what 's the point of making synthetic drugs ? well , synthetic drugs makers have easy access to customers by marketing these drugs as harmless household items			1
so they make lots of money			0
" it is very profitable business , " said @entity40			0
" there have been multimillion dollar seizure -- cash seizure with these people that are selling these drugs			2
" are these drugs legal ? it 's a tricky question because the laws can not keep up with the variety of chemical compounds			2
the federal government and at least 38 states have taken steps to ban the substances			0
but , as soon as one compound is banned , the molecular structure of the synthetic product is altered and that " changes the whole structure of the drug , so the drug becomes legal and we 're at it again , " @entity137 , @entity41 chief of operations , said at a news conference in june , according to @entity148			1
retailers are also skirting the law by labeling the drugs as " not for human consumption , " according to the @entity41 's @entity40			1
" it 's a cat - and - mouse game that these retailers are using , " he said			0
" there is an underground market that know exactly how to abuse that product to get high			0
" everyone knows that drugs are harmful			2
so what 's the big deal about these ? most drug manufacturers aim to refine their drug for purity , to increase the street value and their profit margin			0
but with synthetic drugs , the manufacturers ' main goal is to alter the chemical compound to stay one step ahead of the law			1
" the @entity86 has encountered over 200 new substances over the past four years , " @entity40 explained			0
" our chemists are finding multiple drugs , multiple compounds when we make purchases of these drugs			2
" and that means there 's no standard when it comes to these drugs			2
" when we buy these substances and send them to the lab , they could have one compound in it , or they could have five separate compounds			0
" the combination of those compounds and their reactions " is very scary , " @entity40 said			0
" we do not know the long term effect that it will have on a person 's body			0
" @entity200 went from being a normal 16 - year - old to nearly dying after trying a form of synthetic marijuana packaged as " potpourri " that she bought with her friends at a gas station			2
her family believes the drug is what caused her to have several strokes , which have limited her physical and mental abilities			0
synthetic drugs also have " unpredictable effects on human behavior , " according to dr. @entity216 , who works in an emergency room in @entity218			1
" this is a terrible drug because it takes a combination of methamphetamine , and the paranoia and the aggressiveness , and @entity225 , the hallucinations , and @entity227 , the extreme paranoia that you get , ( and ) combines it into one , " @entity216 explained			0
police in @entity232 , @entity233 , reported two violent incidents linked to use of bath salts in 2011			2
in one , a woman allegedly tried to behead her 71 - year - old mother ; in the second , a man on bath salts used his teeth to tear up the back seat of a patrol car			0
that 's particularly troublesome when some retailers are marketing synthetic drugs as a safer , legal alternative			1
who is making this stuff ? most of the chemicals that are used to make these synthetic drugs are coming directly from @entity253 , according to the @entity41 's @entity40			1
" they ship the bulk product here in the @entity86 , where we have individuals that will take that product and package it for retail distribution , " he explained			0
according to a recent article in @entity148 , the drugs come mostly from " suburban laboratories around @entity253 port cities ... from where they can be easily shipped to @entity267 or @entity268 using regular international courier services			2
" they 're also available in larger quantities and sold over the internet as " research chemicals , " according to @entity148			2
the @entity41 is " in dialogue " with @entity253 about the problem , @entity40 said , without offering specifics			1
" we are also in dialogue and conversation with our international counterparts experiencing the same issues that we are in this designer drug problem , " he said			0
" that is one of the ways to fight this problem is through demand reduction and the education of the people who are using these products			0
" so who 's selling it here in the @entity86 ? @entity40 says people are starting their own businesses to sell these drugs once they see the profit potential			1
" and they are starting to become organized , " he added			0
" is it organized crime ? not at this point , but they are figuring out ways to work around our laws			0
they are making millions of dollars figuring out how to launder that money			0
we do n't even know if they are paying taxes on this money			0
" these retailers have even taken the feds to court to protect their business : four stores sued the @entity41 in 2011 , claiming the federal agency was " impeding their business , " @entity40 said			1
" we do n't have a problem with people selling legitimate items			2
but when you are selling basic rat poison to our children , we do take issue with that			0
