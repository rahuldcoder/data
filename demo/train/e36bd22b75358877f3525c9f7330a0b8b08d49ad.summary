just over two weeks after the fatal shooting , and less than a month before an arrest was made , police in @entity1 , @entity2 , urged prosecutors to take @entity6 into custody after arguing his killing of @entity9 was " ultimately avoidable			1
" this disclosure came out thursday , part of a wealth of information released that is related to the case , including the medical 's examiner 's finding that the 17 - year - old @entity9 had traces of drugs in his system in an autopsy conducted hours after his death			2
overall , the newly released material paints the most complete picture yet of how investigators built the case , as well as its complexity			0
the police perspective was most succinctly stated in a march 13 " capias request " -- a request that someone be taken into custody -- sent to the state 's attorney			0
it speaks to the fact that @entity6 ignored a police dispatcher 's advice not to chase @entity9 , as well as his communications with @entity9 prior to the shooting			1
new documents shed light on @entity9 killing " the encounter between @entity6 and @entity9 was ultimately avoidable by @entity6 , if @entity6 had remained in his vehicle and awaited the arrival of law enforcement , or conversely if he had identified himself to @entity9 as a concerned citizen and initiated dialog ( sic ) in an effort to dispel each party 's concern " the request said			1
" there is no indication that @entity9 was involved in any criminal activity			0
" in his 911 call just before the shooting , @entity6 had speculated that the teen looked like he was " up to no good or he 's on drugs or something			2
" but @entity9 's defenders have portrayed @entity6 as the aggressor , accusing him of profiling the @entity65 - @entity64 teen			1
plus , one expert notes the traces of the marijuana - related substance found in the teen 's system , as measured hours after his death , do n't necessarily speak to any level of intoxication , while another adds that marijuana use typically does n't make people prone to aggression			2
@entity9 's blood contained @entity79 , which is the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana , according to autopsy results released thursday			1
the autopsy was conducted february 27 , the day after the teenager was shot dead			0
toxicology tests found elements of the drug in the teenager 's chest blood -- 1.5 nanograms per milliliter of one type ( @entity79 ) , as well as 7.3 nanograms of another type ( @entity92 ) -- according to the medical examiner 's report			1
there also was a presumed positive test of cannabinoids in @entity9 's urine , according to the medical examiner 's report			1
it was not immediately clear how significant these amounts were			0
no precise levels on the urine were released			0
dr. @entity104 , a toxicologist , cautioned against reading too much into the blood thc levels , adding that one can not make a direct correlation between those findings and a level of intoxication			0
he also noted levels of @entity79 , which can linger in a person 's system for days , can spike after death in certain areas of the body because of redistribution			2
and dr. @entity117 , an addiction specialist who hosts a show on @entity120 's sister network @entity119 , added that marijuana typically does not make users more aggressive			2
concentrations of @entity79 routinely rise to 100 to 200 ng / ml after marijuana use , though it typically falls to below 5 ng / ml within three hours of it being smoked , according to information on the @entity128 's website			1
while some states have zero - tolerance policies for any drug traces for driving while impaired , others set certain benchmarks , the website of @entity135 's @entity136 notes			0
in @entity138 , that equates to 2 ng / ml for @entity79 and 5 ng / ml for @entity92 , also known as marijuana metabolite			2
the cutoff level in @entity141 is 2 ng / ml for @entity79 and 50 ng / ml for @entity92			0
according to the medical examiner 's report , which was one of several documents on the case released thursday by the office of special prosecutor @entity148 , @entity9 died from a gunshot wound to chest fired from " intermediate range , " within 36 inches			2
the autopsy report lists the manner of death as a homicide			0
what happened that night ? @entity6 , 28 , is charged with second - degree murder for killing @entity9 in the @entity1 neighborhood where the @entity65 - @entity64 teen was staying			1
@entity9 's father , @entity160 , had taken his son with him to @entity1 , about four hours away from the boy 's home and where the father 's fiance lived , after the teen was suspended for 10 days from @entity167 in @entity168			1
according to records obtained by the @entity170 , @entity9 had been suspended from school three times : once for writing graffiti on a door , another time for school truancy and the last time due to drug residue being found in his backpack			2
speaking of her son 's suspension to @entity120 's @entity184 , @entity181 said , " whatever he had dealings with the school , it was not criminal , it was not violent , he 's never been arrested			0
" just before the shooting , @entity6 called 911 to complain about a suspicious person in his neighborhood			0
in the call @entity6 , a neighborhood watch volunteer , said he was following @entity9 after the teen started to run , prompting the dispatcher to tell him , " we do n't need you to do that			1
" @entity6 apparently disregarded that advice			0
much has been made about whether @entity6 during that call used a racial epithet in referring to @entity9			1
but an @entity199 analysis , released thursday , determined that the word could not be definitively identified " due to weak signal level and poor recording quality			0
" a screaming voice could be heard on other 911 calls placed by neighbors , with some speculating those screams came from @entity9 and others that they belonged to @entity6			1
the @entity199 did not make a final determination either way , citing several reasons including the fact they came during " an extreme emotional state , " there were n't enough words to make a good comparison and the sound quality was low and distant			0
@entity199 analysis -- @entity6 's 911 call ( pdf -- strong language ) @entity6 claimed , according a police report released earlier , that he 'd been " assaulted ( by @entity9 ) and his head was struck on the pavement			1
" according a report from the @entity227 , released thursday , @entity6 had " abrasions to his forehead , " " bleeding / tenderness to his nose , " and a " small laceration to the back of his head " when emergency personnel arrived at the scene at 7:27 p.m. , six minutes after they were first called			1
by that time , @entity9 had no apparent pulse , according to the fire and @entity242 report			1
emergency personnel attempted mouth - to - mask resuscitation and chest compressions , to no avail			0
he was pronounced dead at 7:30 p.m. prosecutors have said @entity6 , who is a white @entity248 , killed the unarmed teenager unjustly after profiling him			1
@entity6 , who has pleaded not guilty , has said that he shot @entity9 in self - defense			2
the start of the trial has n't been set			0
the case put a spotlight on race relations , spurring protests nationwide and drawing prominent civil rights leaders to central @entity2 denouncing the actions of @entity1 police and calling for @entity6 's arrest			1
special prosecutor @entity148 announced he 'd been charged on april 11 , weeks after @entity1 police initially declined to do so			0
it also raised questions about gun laws , as well as the merits of the " @entity273 " law in @entity2 , and similar laws in other states that allow people to use deadly force anywhere they feel a reasonable threat of serious injury or death .			0
