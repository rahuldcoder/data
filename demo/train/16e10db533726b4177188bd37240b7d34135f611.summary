-- congratulations are in order , sorta , for @entity3 and his @entity5 team			1
according to @entity10 's annual list , the first film in their trilogy was downloaded well over eight million times in 2013 , making it the year 's most pirated movie			1
it was n't , however , a runaway victory			0
" @entity21 " was followed closely by " @entity16 , " which has an estimated download count of 8.1 million — just 300,000 fewer than " @entity5 , " even though " @entity5 's " worldwide box office take was more than twice what @entity19 made			1
two blockbuster sequels — " @entity22 " and " @entity23 " — plus a surprisingly high - performing @entity25 nominee ( " @entity26 " ) round out the top 5			0
but as @entity10 notes , the list also holds a few surprises : though one @entity30 film made the list , another , much bigger one — " @entity34 : catching @entity35 " — did n't			0
( maybe we can blame this on catching @entity35 's november release date			0
) high grossers like " @entity40 " and " gravity " are absent as well , though " @entity43 , " with its modest worldwide gross of $ 105,200,903 , somehow eked out the number 7 spot			0
still not as weird as last year , when " @entity47 " somehow reigned as the list 's top movie			0
see below for the full top 10			0
note , though , that there 's no way to draw data from online streaming and cyberlocker download sources — which means that total piracy numbers are probably significantly higher than these			1
