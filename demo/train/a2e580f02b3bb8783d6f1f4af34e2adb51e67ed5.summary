-- @entity1 may have bitten off more than he can chew this time			2
already banned twice in his career for biting an opponent , the @entity3 striker was seemingly at it again in his country 's key @entity8 victory over @entity10			1
just before @entity3 's winning goal , the striker was embroiled in an off the ball incident with @entity10 defender @entity13 with both men falling to the floor			1
television pictures showed @entity1 dipping his head towards @entity13 , and when the @entity19 defender eventually got up , he pulled down his shirt and appeared to furiously indicate that he had been bitten on the shoulder			2
" @entity1 is a sneak and he gets away with it because @entity25 want their stars to play in the @entity8 , " @entity13 told @entity22			2
" i 'd love to see if they have the courage to use video evidence against him			2
the referee saw the bite mark too , but he did nothing about it. , " added the @entity32 defender			2
the 27 - year - old @entity1 will now face a nervous wait to find out if football 's world governing body @entity25 will take action retrospectively -- given it was missed by the match officials - and punish him			1
a @entity25 spokesman told @entity0 : " we are awaiting the official match reports and will gather all the necessary elements in order to evaluate the matter			2
" but @entity25 vice-president @entity48 , who is also presides as head of the body 's referees committee , says he has huge concerns over @entity1 's actions			2
" i have watched the incident several times on television , " he told reporters			0
" there is no doubt @entity1 is a fantastic footballer but , once again , his actions have left him open to severe criticism			0
" @entity25 must investigate the incident seriously and take whatever disciplinary action deemed necessary			0
" but @entity3 coach @entity64 insists he did not see the incident when he addressed the press in his news conference			1
" i 'd like to see the images , " he said			0
" i did n't see that			0
and if it happened the referee probably did n't see it			0
so no i do n't have any more comments to make			0
we had more important things than this in a football match			0
" there seems there is animosity against this football player , " he added			0
" he just came out of a difficult moment and he has been penalized			0
there are people hiding behind the tree waiting for something to happen			0
" @entity89 's 81st minute header secured victory for @entity3 against an @entity19 team which played the final half hour with 10 - men after @entity93 was sent off			1
the defeat led to @entity19 coach @entity95 offering his resignation in his news conference after the game -- but all eyes were still on @entity1			1
the @entity100 , who plays his club football with @entity103 , was banned for 10 games in april 2013 after being found guilty of biting @entity106 defender @entity105			0
he was also guilty of biting during his time in the @entity108 with @entity109 where he was banned for seven games after leaving a scar on the collarbone of @entity113			0
@entity1 's rap sheet is lengthy			2
at the @entity115 in @entity116 , he deliberately handled the ball on the goal - line to deny @entity119 a place in the semifinals of the @entity8			1
he was sent off for his troubles but @entity119 missed the penalty and @entity3 went on to finish third in the tournament			1
the following year after his move to @entity103 , @entity1 was found guilty of racially abusing @entity127 's @entity126			2
he was fined $ 63,000 and banned for eight matches			0
last week , after scoring both goals in his side 's 2 - 1 victory over @entity132 , @entity1 hit out at the @entity134 media after claiming he had been unfairly treated over his transgressions			1
" before the game people in @entity132 laughed about my attitude over the last few years , " he told reporters following the game			1
" i want to see what they think now			0
i have dreamed of this moment			0
" @entity1 enjoyed a sensational season with @entity103 -- scoring 31 league goals to help his club qualify for the @entity146			0
he was voted @entity147 by his fellow colleagues and also named as the journalists ' @entity147 too -- awards that reflected a feeling that @entity1 had put behind him his troubled past			0
his participation in the @entity8 had looked in danger when he suffered a knee injury in @entity103 's final game of the season			2
he was forced to undergo keyhole surgery and missed @entity3 's opening game defeat by @entity161 before making a near miraculous return in time to face @entity132 just five weeks after his operation , scoring both goals in the @entity167 side 's 2 - 1 win			1
@entity3 's next game is likely to be against @entity169 on saturday in @entity170			1
meanwhile , @entity10 coach @entity95 says he will step down following another @entity8 disappointment			1
@entity95 , who replaced @entity173 as coach in 2010 , also failed to guide @entity10 out of the group stage in @entity116 four years ago			1
" at the end of the match i spoke to the president of the federation , i have told them i am going to resign from my position , " he told reporters			0
" when there is failure , the person in charge must take responsibility , " added @entity95 , who only extended his contract last month			1
@entity189 , the president of the @entity190 , also announced his resignation while stating he hoped to convince @entity95 to stay on			1
in the group 's other game , @entity161 sealed top spot with a goalless draw against @entity132			1
