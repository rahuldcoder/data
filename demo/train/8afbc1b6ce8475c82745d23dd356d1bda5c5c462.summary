-- @entity2 's people are justifiably proud of their country , which , sandwiched as it is between historically powerful neighbors , has managed skillfully to play off its rivals and retain its independence			1
known as the " land of smiles " to tourists but the " land of freedom " to those born in the country once known as @entity2 , its astute line of @entity16 monarchs in the 18th and 19th century managed to juggle competing @entity18 and @entity19 colonial interests in the region			1
@entity2 , as a result , is the only country in @entity22 that was never colonized by a @entity24 power			1
in the 20th century , @entity2 's independence has brought with it challenges that are still being resolved despite its rise to the forefront of the region 's emerging economies			1
according to the @entity32 , it is now second - largest economy in @entity22 after @entity34			1
the 86 - year - old @entity35 has been the head of state of @entity2 for more than six decades			1
during the country 's often - turbulent political history , he has acted as a force for continuity and tradition even when the country has lurched between political crises and military coups			1
from 1946 , when he acceded to the throne , to the present , @entity35 has reigned through more than 20 prime ministers , 17 military coups and 17 constitutions and steered the country through the destabilizing effects of the nearby @entity51 during the 1960s and ' 70s			1
over the years , the king has intervened periodically in political crises , using his influence to try to defuse situations that threatened to destabilize the country			1
for much of the first few decades of @entity35 's reign , the running of the country was dominated by the @entity2 military and a bureaucratic elite , according to the @entity62			1
governments replaced one another through " a long series of mostly bloodless coups , " it said			2
the painful and slow transition towards a more democratic government began in the 1970s			2
that process is still continuing today			0
coups and continuation from 1992 until this year @entity2 is generally considered to have functioned as a democracy , according to the @entity62			0
however , the current government is one run by the military and two military takeovers have occurred in the country since 2006			1
the first , a coup in september 2006 , ousted prime minister @entity80 and installed an unelected government for more than a year			0
since then , @entity86 forces -- whose " red shirt " supporters are largely drawn from the rural north of the country but also enjoy support from urban intellectuals -- have periodically engaged in large - scale protests			1
" yellow shirt " opposition supporters have also taken to the streets in high numbers			0
there have been clashes , the most violent with security forces â € ” the worst of which was a crackdown by security forces on red shirts in 2010 that left dozens dead			0
a series of anti-government protests and sporadic violent clashes on the streets of the capital @entity109 began in november 2013			0
in may this year , after months of civil unrest , @entity111 -- @entity80 's sister -- was removed as prime minister after a @entity114 ruled that she had illegally transferred a government official			0
later that month the @entity2 army enacted a coup and declared martial law			0
the general who led the coup , general @entity119 is the current prime minister of an interim government			0
he was the sole candidate for the post and was selected by the country 's @entity123			1
members of the assembly were chosen by @entity119 ; more than half are also in the military			0
economic growth at the core of @entity2 's current political fault line is the country 's changing economic dynamic			1
of the many changes that @entity2 has undergone since @entity35 came to the throne , the growth in the nation 's economy is considered to be the most spectacular			1
largely agrarian when he came to power , @entity2 has since become an industrial and services sector giant in the region			1
it remains one of the world 's top rice producers , is one of the world 's most popular tourist destinations and is a regional manufacturing hub for the auto industry and for hi - tech electronics			0
however , with the largely rural and once - impoverished northeast of the country now at the center of a boom , its growing middle class in the rural region have been calling for greater political representation			1
economic growth in the northeast @entity161 region hit 40 % between 2007 and 2011 , compared with 23 % for the rest of @entity2 over that period and just 17 % for greater @entity109 , according to government figures			2
@entity161 , which once exported people to @entity109 and the rest of the world as cheap migrant labor , is seeing its workers return			0
while the @entity32 predicts that @entity2 is on track to meet most of its @entity170 -- including eradicating extreme poverty and hunger , and improving maternal health -- income inequality and a lack of equal opportunities persist , especially between @entity109 and the rest of the country			2
with an official unemployment figure of less than 1 % of the population , @entity2 could be seen as a model for other @entity22 countries			1
yet the plight of the country 's estimated two to three million migrant workers -- most of whom are from neighboring @entity186 and fill many low - paid , manual labor jobs -- has gained international attention			2
most migrate willingly , but in june this year the @entity189 downgraded @entity2 to tier 3 , the lowest level , in its annual @entity192 report			0
the downgrade means that @entity2 has not met minimum standards in combating illegal migration and human trafficking and not made significant efforts to do so			0
in a letter to @entity0 , the @entity2 government said , " @entity2 has been actively combating human trafficking and the issue remains a top priority for the current administration			0
" acknowledging the downgrade , they added , " @entity2 will continue to do our utmost to combat human trafficking and illegal migration			0
" another ongoing challenge for the country is the @entity212 separatist movement in the south of the country			2
over 90 % of @entity2 's population is classified as @entity216 , yet in the southern regions of @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222 there is a @entity212 majority -- @entity2 government statistics put @entity2 @entity225 at just 6 % of the region 's population			2
@entity212 there have complained this @entity216 minority dominates the region , and many @entity212 hardliners view the education system as a tool of @entity2 colonialism			2
as such separatist groups have operated in the region for over 10 years , according to ngo @entity237 , that monitors the conflict			2
these politically motivated groups often target security officials and @entity2 government operations			0
according to the @entity62 , in march 2014 , at least 50 violent incidents killed more than 30 people in these provinces ; @entity237 put the cumulative deaths from related conflicts at around 5,500			0
the @entity2 government has stated in a letter to @entity0 that " the problems in the @entity251 have no direct linkage to religions ... [ and ] no direct linkage to any separatist movements			0
