@entity2 at least three conservative critics of house speaker @entity1 , say they 'll be voting for somebody else when lawmakers return to @entity2 next week to officially open the new @entity7 - dominated @entity6 , previewing some of the conservative opposition that will greet the @entity10 @entity9			1
rep. @entity11 was the latest to publicly announce his decision not to support @entity1 for his current position , making the news on his social media accounts saturday night			1
on friday , rep. @entity16 pointed to @entity1 's moves in december to advance a measure favored by president @entity19 to fund the government for the next 10 months			2
" speaker @entity1 went too far when he teamed with @entity19 to advance this legislation			2
he relinquished the power of the purse , and with it he lost my vote , " @entity16 said in a statement			0
rep. @entity27 said saturday he too would not support @entity1 and said he opposed the way @entity1 steered legislation the @entity31 floor , in some instances without a full 72 hours for lawmakers to read enormous bills			1
" during my first two years as a congressman i discovered a significant source of the dysfunction			0
i watched the @entity31 leadership , " said @entity27 in a statement			0
@entity27 and @entity40 are unlikely to be the only @entity9 to vote against @entity1 for speaker			2
in a local radio interview first noted nationally by @entity45 , rep. @entity42 ( @entity43 ) said he 'd been talking with 16 to 18 conservatives about identifying an alternative candidate for speaker and rallying around that person			2
related : @entity49 brings back @entity1 's familiar right flank hangover a freshman @entity9 , @entity52 , said in october that he 'd told @entity1 personally that he would n't be voting for him for speaker			1
" i told him that if the first thing that i did when i got up there is violate my word to the voters , and break that trust , not only would i lose that confidence , but , immediately in the back of his head , he would be wondering at what point would i break my word to him , " @entity52 told the @entity54			0
dropping a few of his own party 's votes in the speaker 's race is n't new for @entity1			1
when the last @entity6 kicked off in 2013 , there were nine republicans -- including @entity40 -- who voted against @entity1 , and three others who did n't vote for a candidate for speaker			1
most of them had complained that @entity1 is n't enough of a hard - liner			0
indeed , in @entity40 's note friday , he said " our @entity79 is under assault " because @entity7 have n't fought strongly enough against @entity19 's moves to curb some deportations , restrict environmentally - harmful emissions , shift prisoners out of the @entity85 , @entity86 detention facility and strike a deal to ease relations with @entity86			2
the wake of november 's massive midterm victories for republicans , @entity16 said , was the best opportunity @entity7 had to use their funding authority to rein @entity19 in			0
" it seemed @entity95 were melting down , @entity7 were unified , and all we had to do was buy enough time to get our @entity9 reinforcements to @entity2 in january , " he said			0
the position that @entity1 should be ousted has backing from @entity9 voters			0
sixty percent said they 'd pick someone new over @entity1 for speaker , according to a survey commissioned by @entity105 , conducted by @entity106 and released this week			0
still , it 's not clear that there are enough @entity7 willing to reject @entity1 to throw the vote for speaker into a second round			1
the @entity7 holds 247 seats in the @entity31 , and @entity1 will need a simple majority of 218 to be elected speaker			1
that means he can afford to lose 29 votes from @entity7 -- assuming no @entity95 support him			1
if 30 or more republicans do oppose @entity1 , that would mean another round of voting , with conservatives hoping @entity1 would drop out of the running and @entity1 's allies likely heaping immense pressure on the hold - outs			1
@entity3 's @entity124 contributed to this report			0

rep. @entity11 is the latest @entity31 *member* to say he wo n't back @entity1 for speaker
other conservatives are *expected* to oppose @entity1 , too -- just as they did in the 2013 speaker 's election
@entity1 can afford to lose up to 29 @entity7 and still win another two years in the post
