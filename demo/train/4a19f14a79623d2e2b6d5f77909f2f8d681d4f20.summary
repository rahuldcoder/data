-- as @entity2 swirls in the @entity3 -- becoming more powerful mile by mile -- it threatens to unleash disaster once again on vulnerable and often unaware @entity7 by friday night			1
the possibility of stinging rain and tree - bending wind descending on the hundreds of thousands of @entity7 living in camps has aid groups in the country on high alert			1
by the time @entity2 strikes @entity7 , it is forecast to be at hurricane strength , bringing destructive wind and water to an area still recovering from a devastating 2010 earthquake			1
as much of 12 inches of rain is forecast for some parts of the country , posing danger to the more than 400,000 @entity7 in the camps			1
many of those people had no idea that a storm was coming , @entity0 correspondent @entity25 reported from @entity30			1
not until a translator told them that a potential hurricane was nearing did people in the streets know of @entity2 's approach or that the government had opened some shelters			1
residents of one tent community said they were staying put with their belongings and would ride out the storm			2
there were no signs of hurricane preparations in the city , no buildings being boarded up in @entity30			1
@entity2 threatens to bring more destruction , cholera to @entity7 " these rains could cause life - threatening flash floods and mudslides , " the @entity50 in @entity51 said			1
@entity2 also poses a risk to the @entity56 in @entity57 , @entity58			1
the storm could hit anywhere in the state , gov. @entity62 said thursday , and it will be up to convention organizers to decide the fate of the event			1
but before it nears @entity58 , @entity2 is forecast to run over @entity67 , the island that 's home to @entity7 and the @entity68			1
" the risks are obvious in terms of flooding of low - lying areas , " said @entity69 , director for @entity70 in @entity7			1
even though two - and - a - half years have passed since the earthquake , its impact on the country can not be understated , he said			2
large amounts of rainfall will cause mudslides and runoff that can block roads , or worse			0
" the country is still recovering from the earthquake			1
it 's difficult to imagine that ( a storm ) will hurt the most vulnerable places again , " @entity69 said			1
as of 8 p.m. et , @entity2 was about 210 miles ( 340 kilometers ) southeast of @entity90 , @entity68 , the center said			0
it was moving to the west - northwest near 16 mph with maximum sustained winds near 45 mph			0
the center of the storm is forecast to approach the @entity68 on thursday night and move over the south coast of @entity67 on friday , the center said			1
while the storm is yet to reach hurricane strength , it has already delivered shock waves to the @entity3 , postponing a hearing for september 11 terrorist attack suspects at the @entity104 naval base in @entity105 , @entity106			1
" @entity107 is forecast during the next 48 hours , and @entity2 could still become a hurricane on friday before it reaches @entity67 , " according to forecasters			1
aid organizations were keeping an eye on @entity7			1
according to the @entity113 high commissioner for refugees , 421,000 people are in camps in and around @entity30 , the capital			1
@entity2 could be the first significant storm to hit @entity7 since the devastating earthquake			1
@entity117 threatened in 2011 , but it weakened before hitting western @entity7			1
the forecast map shows @entity2 crossing the nation as a tropical storm with winds under 74 mph			2
" we watch those storms every single time they come near because @entity7 is so vulnerable , " said @entity123 , a spokeswoman for the @entity125 humanitarian organization @entity124			1
the agency has met with the government in previous summers to discuss contingency plans for major storms , and pre-positioned relief items are available , she said			0
@entity2 's path remains uncertain , but some computer models show the storm slicing its way up @entity58 's peninsula			1
others send it farther west , into the @entity143			0
officials are taking the threat seriously			0
" obviously , we hope @entity2 does n't hit @entity58 , but we must take every precaution , " said @entity62 , the @entity58 governor			1
while the convention will have the final say on any changes to the planned event , the organizers are working with state and local officials to ensure everyone has the same information , the governor said			2
but @entity57 is not the only part of @entity58 that could be hit , and @entity62 urged @entity157 to be prepared			2
" what everyone needs to do is to starting tracking it , watch the weather , heed any warnings , get ready , get 72 hours ' worth of supplies , " he said			0
@entity57 mayor @entity165 said his city is prepared for the 50,000 people headed to there for the @entity56 , which starts monday			0
" we have contingency plan after contingency plan , " @entity165 said			0
" we are ready in the event that it happens			0
i do n't think it 's going to be a factor in this particular convention			2
but we are prepared in the event that it is			0
" @entity62 said that any police officers who were going to @entity57 will still go , and the @entity180 will stand ready to back up authorities around the state			0
he said he spoke with @entity56 candidate @entity183 and assured him the state would be ready for the convention			2
" we 're a hospitality state that knows how to deal with hurricanes , " he said			0
possibly complicating matters , the convention site -- the @entity189 -- is a mandatory evacuation zone once storms reach 96 mph , a category 2 hurricane , according to the @entity193			2
the current forecast does n't have @entity2 reaching that status			0
at the @entity105 base , officials canceled the pretrial arguments scheduled to get under way in the trial of @entity201 and four others			0
@entity201 , who has been held since 2006 , is facing charges related to the 9/11 attacks			0
@entity206 officials said all court events at @entity105 were canceled because of the potential hurricane			2

dangerous surf and rip currents will affect waters there for the next few days			0
@entity248 and @entity249 a tropical storm warning is in effect , and tropical storm conditions are expected by late friday			0
@entity104 @entity254 bands of the storm could reach @entity58 by sunday			1
but the eye of the storm could make landfall anywhere from @entity260 , @entity261 , to the @entity262 , @entity0 meteorologist @entity256 said			0
the five - day projection from the hurricane center puts the storm approaching @entity104 landfall on the @entity58 peninsula tuesday			1
