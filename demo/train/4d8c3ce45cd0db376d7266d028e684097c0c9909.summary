the new immigration bill , known as @entity30 , was approved by the state @entity32 and @entity12 wednesday			0
the state 's governor will have the final say , with the power to sign the bill into law or veto it			1
" we will conduct a final review of the legislation as passed and make a final decision from there , " said @entity39 , a spokesman for gov. @entity40			1
" governor @entity40 's goal is to emerge with an immigration bill that is simplified , clarified , more effective , and more enforceable			1
" @entity2 sen. @entity48 told @entity0 that the new bill addresses unintended consequences of the state 's immigration law , including clarifying the types of documents that can serve as a form of official identification			1
it does not address parts of the law that are at issue in federal courts , he said			0
critics say parts of the new measure would be even harsher than last year 's immigration law , which is known as the toughest in the nation			1
" the new bill preserves most of the law while adding several positions that make it even more dangerous , " the @entity67 said in a statement			1
@entity15 , of the @entity16 , said the biggest problem of the new bill was the requirement that the @entity74 post online the names of illegal immigrants that appear in state courts			2

but lawmakers backing the bill said it protects the state 's residents and helps its economy			2
@entity2 's existing law , known as @entity134 , has several provisions , including one requiring police who make lawful traffic stops or arrests to try to determine the immigration status of anyone they suspect might be in the country illegally			1
a federal appeals court has blocked some components , however , including one requiring @entity2 officials to check the immigration status of children in public schools			0
the @entity2 law is one of a number of several state laws aiming to crack down on illegal immigration , and has become part of a nationwide skirmish between state federal officials over who controls immigration enforcement			2
