@entity1 's @entity0 broke records over the weekend , selling more than 5 million units			1
most of those new owners , many of whom lined up at @entity1 stores and other retailers , are presumably happy with their new gadget , which has been praised for its bigger display screen , lighter and thinner form , and faster processor			2
but , as with many new tech products , there have been glitches , too			0
as the new iphones get road - tested , buyers have taken to the @entity19 to complain about issues ranging from the fixable to the unfortunately final			0
the doozy has been a spotty maps application			1
for the first time , @entity1 's latest operating system replaced rival @entity26 's mapping service with its own			1
as many people got their first look at it with a new phone , they 've found huge chunks of the world missing , or locations showing up in the wrong place			0
( @entity1 said the app is a work in progress and will be fixed			1
) plenty has been written about that issue			0
but other gripes have emerged as well			1
and , given the hyper - intense nature of the tech world 's " love - hate " relationship with their gadgets , a couple just sound downright silly			0
after a few days of putting the new smartphone through its paces , here are five gripes people have with the @entity0			1
@entity26 : no plans ' yet ' for @entity57 mapping app 1			1
scratches @entity1 prides itself on making products that are n't just functional but beautiful as well			0
but users are reporting that after having their iphone 5s for only days , or even hours , the sheen on the sleek , aluminum phone is getting scratched up			1
@entity64 at @entity65 posted a @entity67 video of her 2 - year - old daughter hitting and scratching the phone 's aluminum rear case with a set of keys , creating visible scratches and dents			1
similar scuffing of the @entity76 revealed little , if any , damage			0
" i know this is kind of an extreme case , but she 's not the strongest two - year - old , " @entity64 said			0
" and this all just happened , so i can only imagine what this is going to look like after a couple of weeks of solid use			0
" answering an e-mail from a user , @entity88 , @entity1 senior vice president of worldwide marketing , downplayed the issue			0
" any aluminum product may scratch or chip with use , exposing its natural silver color , " @entity88 said in the e-mail , reported and verified by @entity1 - centric blog 9to5 @entity91 " that is normal			1
" translated on @entity97 by @entity99 writer @entity98 : " @entity1 : iphones are n't @entity101 , they 're just shedding their skins to become beautiful butterflies			0
lightning dock connector the tech world is nothing if not full of change			0
but many longtime @entity1 users are irked at the company 's decision to use a smaller connector port , called @entity112 , on the @entity0 and new ipods			1
with one fell swoop , that meant both a need for new power cords and that the new products wo n't connect with older speaker systems , alarm clocks and other accessories			0
the fix ? a $ 29 adapter ( which costs $ 39 if you want a new cable with it )			0
and even then , the adapter does n't support video or the " @entity129 out " function for transmitting some data from the devices			2
" day 3 of having the new @entity0 and i already lost the power cord # thanksapple , " wrote one @entity97 user			1
" it 's time to gouge our customers for a ton more money , " @entity136 commenter dawsg4ever quipped			0
a @entity112 - to - usb cable costs $ 19 and , according to @entity1 's website , currently has a one - to two - week wait time to be shipped			0
the phone 's too light we told you some of these are kind of weird			2
one of @entity1 's selling points for the new phone is that it 's the lightest smartphone ever			0
one of the emerging complaints ? that it 's the lightest smartphone ever			0
to some users , a phone without the usual heft feels suspiciously cheap , toylike			2
@entity157 rounded up some of the gripes under the headline , " the @entity160			2
" those , culled from @entity97 , included these nuggets : " can i be honest and say i wish the @entity0 was slightly thicker and heavier			1
hate thin phones ! " " held the @entity0 5			1
way too light for this spazz - attack			2
i need a heavier phone so i do n't completely destroy it			0
" " this new @entity0 is way too light			1
i feel like its gon na just fly outta my hand with the slightest breeze # firstworldproblems " should you upgrade to the @entity0 ? 4			1
screen issues ok ... there are 5 million new phones in the wild now , so inevitably there are going to be some lemons			1
it 's hard to know how widespread it is , but a handful of problems with the phone 's touchscreen are bubbling up , too			0
one @entity67 video shows what appear to be weird bubbles showing up on one part of the display screen when the user touches another			1
threads on the @entity191 site also were filling up with people who said their screens started flickering just hours after getting their new phone			0
leaking light phones are n't supposed to leak			2
but users on multiple forums are reporting that light from the screen appears to be showing through gaps around the @entity0 's antenna and power button			1
@entity204 said it 's happening on one of its phones and shows light streaming out of a small crack beneath the power button			1
the report said the leak is only visible in low light			2
users said @entity1 has been offering replacements			2
5 big changes in @entity57			2

the @entity0 has sold more than 5 million units , but some users have gripes
the top complaint has been about a spotty maps app that replaced @entity224
a video shows the aluminum casing scratching easily
light leaks have also been reported
