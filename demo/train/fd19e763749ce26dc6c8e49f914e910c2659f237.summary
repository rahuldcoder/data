@entity0 -- in the @entity3 you live by the @entity4 , which states , " i will always place the mission first			0
i will never accept defeat			0
i will never leave a fallen comrade behind			1
" i am alive today because my helicopter crew lived by these words			0
when our aircraft was shot down in november 2004 , the injuries i sustained were devastating			0
the amount of blood i had lost in a matter of minutes was so vast that my crew thought i was dead			0
they could have left me in that dusty field in @entity21 , but they did n't			0
instead , they stood their ground in the face of approaching enemy , risked their lives , and carried me to safety			0
they did this regardless of whether i was dead or alive , because the @entity32 warrior does not leave a fallen comrade behind			1
my crew and all the men and women in the @entity32 armed forces know what it means to be a part of something greater than themselves			2
they are @entity32 's finest sons and daughters , and we made a promise to care for them after they serve			1
it is our job in the @entity50 to make sure that promise is kept			2
we at @entity50 stand at a historic time with great opportunities to further our mission in caring for the nation 's 23.4 million veterans and their families			1
with the largest one - year percentage increase in @entity50 's budget in over three decades , president @entity58 has made it very clear that serving our nation 's veterans is a top priority in his administration			1
he wants to increase funding for @entity50 by $ 25 billion above our current baseline over the next five years			1
he launched a new initiative to expand eligibility for veterans ' health care to as many as 500,000 @entity73 8 veterans who were previously denied care			2
and he wants us to invest in better technology to deliver services and benefits to veterans with the quality and efficiency they deserve			2
as commander in chief , president @entity58 has charged secretary @entity82 and all of @entity50 's leadership with a new mission : to transform @entity50 into a 21st - century organization			2
secretary @entity82 has begun to do just that by making @entity50 a more veteran - centered , results - oriented and forward - looking department			2
it will be a different organization from the one that exists today			0
it will be accessible , responsive and transparent			0
to achieve the president 's vision , we must leverage new technologies to serve the various demographics and needs of today 's veterans , while also renewing our commitment to the older generation of veterans			0
these technologies will carry us well into the 21st century as we maintain our mission to serve our nation 's veterans for the rest of their lives			0
tonight , 131,000 veterans will sleep on the streets of our cities			0
these are the same men and women who allowed us to have the opportunities to go to school , get a job and buy a home			0
we are all dishonored anytime a veteran is forced to sleep on the streets , and president @entity58 , @entity119 and the @entity50 leadership team will not stand for this			2
within the next five years , we aim to eliminate veteran homelessness by providing grants to community - based organizations assisting homeless veterans and by attacking all the areas that often lead to homelessness			1
our veterans deserve better , and we are determined to provide them the best care and most timely benefits possible to end homelessness in their ranks			1
we will improve medical care to minority veterans , including female veterans , who are enrolling in @entity50 at historic rates			1
we will also improve access to @entity50 for veterans who live in rural areas			1
all our veterans deserve the best care possible regardless of race , gender or where they live			2
and we are working with the @entity143 to build a fully interoperable electronic records system that will provide each member of our military with a @entity147			1
for @entity50 , this will revolutionize our claims process by making it faster with higher - quality decisions and with fewer errors			1
five years from now , we intend to make @entity50 the provider of choice for veterans -- in insurance , health care , education , home loans and counseling			1
we are going to be the advocate for veterans , their dependents and survivors to make sure we meet their needs , hear their concerns , and take proper action			0
we know that we have a big task ahead of us			0
but there is not a population more deserving of the absolute best than the men and women who have sacrificed so much for our freedoms			0
in the same way that my crew refused to leave me behind , each and every one of us at @entity50 will fight everyday for our nation 's military heroes to ensure that they are never left behind			1
it is our turn to serve @entity32 's warriors , and we at @entity50 consider it a privilege .			1
