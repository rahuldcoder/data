@entity0 -- a sharply divided @entity2 ruled against a former death row inmate who sought damages from the state after prosecutors hid crucial blood tests that would have earlier proven his innocence			2
the 5 - 4 decision tuesday involved @entity10 , who came within weeks of execution and had spent 18 years behind bars before being set free after the new forensic evidence came to light			1
at issue was whether a district attorney 's office should be held liable , under a " failure to train " standard , when one of its prosecutors unconstitutionally withholds exculpatory evidence from a criminal defendant			1
then - @entity26 area district attorney @entity24 claimed his office should not be held fully responsible after one of his staff attorneys violated long - standing , accepted procedures on handling evidence in criminal trials			1
@entity10 's lawyers said the @entity35 's office as a whole should be held liable for the poor training of prosecutors working under @entity24			1
" a district attorney is entitled to rely on prosecutors ' professional training and ethical obligations in the absence of specific reason , such as a pattern of violations , to believe that those tools are insufficient , " justice @entity39 said			0
he was supported by his conservative colleagues chief justice @entity50 and justices @entity51 , @entity53 and @entity54			2
in a tough dissent , @entity55 said " @entity24 's deliberately indifferent attitude created a tinderbox in which ( constitutional ) violations were nigh inevitable			1
" but @entity39 noted prosecutors often face " gray areas , " discretionary judgment calls concerning what evidence may be important to the defense			0
" to prove deliberate indifference , @entity10 needed to show that @entity24 was on notice that , absent additional specified training , it was ' highly predictable ' that the prosecutors in his office would be confounded by those gray areas and make incorrect ... decisions as a result , " he said			1
" in fact , @entity10 had to show that it was so predictable that failing to train the prosecutors amounted to conscious disregard for defendants ' ( constitutional ) rights			0
he did not do so			0
" @entity10 was convicted in 1985 in the murder of a @entity26 man			1
he was also implicated in a separate attempted armed robbery			0
blood tests at the robbery showed the perpetrator had blood type @entity85 lawyers at the @entity35 's office offered conflicting stories about whether the prosecuting attorney ever received the blood test report , or whether @entity10 himself was ever given a confirming blood test			1
@entity10 was eventually convicted of both crimes and received the death sentence for the murder			0
just weeks before his scheduled 1999 lethal injection , private investigators hired by @entity10 's lawyers discovered the original crime lab report in police files			1
the prisoner was then tested and found to have blood type @entity102 a hidden crime scene report also uncovered years after the fact showed eyewitnesses describing the murderer as 6 feet tall with close - cropped hair			1
@entity10 had a large @entity109 at the time , and was only 5 feet , 8 inches			2
that report too was not handed over to the defense at trial			2
armed with the new evidence , state courts then reversed the murder conviction , concluding the armed robbery conviction unfairly deprived @entity10 of his right to testify in own defense at the murder trial			0
after being retried for murder in 2003 , a jury found @entity10 not guilty and he was released from custody			0
a federal civil rights lawsuit was then filed and a jury awarded @entity10 $ 14 million in damages , a judgment upheld by a federal appeals court			0
a landmark 1963 high court ruling -- @entity130 -- said prosecutor have a sworn duty to turn over evidence that may show a defendant is innocent			2
but in a subsequent opinion , the high court said individual prosecutors can not be sued for any constitutional violations in the courtroom			0
the @entity10 decision further limits when defendants can sue for so - called " @entity130 " violations			0
in a rare oral dissent , @entity55 spoke from the bench to strongly criticize the majority 's conclusions			2
" the record in this case abundantly shows flagrant indifference to @entity10 's rights , " she said			1
" the conceded , long - concealed prosecutorial transgressions in @entity10 's trials were neither isolated nor atypical			0
they were just what one would expect given the attitude toward @entity130 pervasive in the district attorney 's office			1
" @entity55 was backed by justices @entity159 , @entity161 and @entity162			0
@entity24 , now retired from his @entity35 post , is the father of entertainer @entity164 the case is @entity10 ( 09 - 571 ) .			2

5 justices rule @entity26 @entity35 's office not liable for prosecutor 's *misbehavior*
4 justices dissent , saying office showed " flagrant indifference "
man came close to execution before blood test , crime report revealed
