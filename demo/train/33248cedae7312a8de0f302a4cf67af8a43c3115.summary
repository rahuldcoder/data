-- far from the sea , a man - made coral reef is taking shape -- and it could change medical operations forever			1
step inside the @entity7 lab in @entity9 's @entity8 and you 'll find row after row of quietly bubbling fish tanks , each containing a precious substance			1
it is hoped the coral grown in this surreal " farm , " could one day be used in bone operations -- encompassing everything from dental implants to spinal procedures			1
unlike animal and human bones , coral ca n't be rejected by the body , say medical experts at the company @entity28 , which manufactures bone replacements from coral			1
grown in the lab , this coral is also free from the diseases you might find in the oceanic variety			1
start - up science @entity37 founded the unusual laboratory six years ago at a cost of $ 2.5 million , with an ambitious vision of tapping into the billion dollar worldwide bone grafting industry			1
but first he 'll need the approval of authorities in the @entity45 and @entity46 , with a decision expected next year			2
the father - of - two 's dedication to the business is astounding -- if not a little disconcerting			2
" in six years of growing corals , i have n't left these four walls for more than 12 hours -- not even once , " he said			0
" for me , it 's 100 % learning as i go			0
i take the mother colony , and i cut off a branch of the coral with a diamond saw			1
then i glue it to another base made out of cement			0
" the delicate ecosystem needs constant care to ensure the water 's salinity , temperature , and chemical make - up is perfect -- any variations and the coral could die			1
the fish swimming around each tank are essentially the " worker bees " of the artificial reef			0
they eat the algae growing on the coral , their feces helps feed the coral , and finally , their movements in the water keep the coral strong			1
and much like the traditional canary in the coalmine , if the fish die , you know something 's not quite right in the water			0
clever company ? happily for @entity90 , his ambitious experiment appears to be thriving , with coral in the lab growing at ten times the normal rate			2
just a small container of the coral costs roughly $ 5 to $ 10 to produce , and sells for around $ 250			2
one of the biggest benefits of the business is its environmental sustainability			0
" we have a constant supply , " says @entity100 of company @entity28			0
" we do n't have to worry that in several years , harvesting from the sea could be forbidden			0
" it 's a concern they 'll never have to think about , when harvesting these remarkable fruits of the desert			0
watch : meet the richest man in @entity109 insight : making wine in the shadow of war			0

inside the *pioneering* coral farm in @entity8 , @entity9
coral could be used for bone grafting procedures
environmentally sustainable , free of oceanic diseases
