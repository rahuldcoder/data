-- in the film " @entity4 , " @entity1 has to live through the exact same day thousands of times			1
in this administration , most @entity5 can be forgiven for feeling as though they 've lived through the same economic speech from president @entity8 nearly as many times			1
given the extraordinary setting of a joint session of @entity12 , one has to question the notion of scheduling a rerun against the first - run debates taking place among @entity18 challengers to this president			2
the speech itself was almost literally a retread of the 2009 stimulus plan @entity8 pushed through a friendly @entity12 with almost no @entity18 support , with one important difference : the president never mentioned the cost of his proposal			1
he demanded that @entity12 pass his bill immediately more than a dozen times during the speech , but not once did he inform @entity12 of its price tag			1
even worse , @entity8 ended up reneging on a claim made by the @entity30 earlier this week that the bill would be entirely funded from current dollars			2
in the speech itself , @entity8 insisted that " everything in this bill will be paid for			1
" but then @entity8 told @entity12 that while their so - called super committee meets to hash out an agreement on cutting $ 1.5 trillion from future spending as part of the deficit - ceiling agreement last month , they could make more cuts to cover the cost of his new bill -- again , without telling them exactly what those costs would be			1
that 's akin to taking a friend out for a big birthday dinner and informing him at the end that he 'll have to find the money to pay the bill			0
the @entity30 insisted that it would pull those numbers together in a week to ten days			0
but the jobs crisis has gone on for years			0
while @entity8 was on vacation , he was telling the media that it was his single highest priority			0
the @entity30 actually wanted to make this speech yesterday			0
and they did so without having scored their own proposal ? it is n't as if @entity8 had promised anything new			0
the " plan " -- which still has not been released -- consists of getting money to states to supposedly save the jobs of teachers and first responders , accelerating public - works projects , extending the payroll tax cut put into place in the december tax deal , and extending jobless benefits for at least another year			1
in case readers have forgotten , that 's what @entity8 called for in the 2009 jobs plan in the stimulus package			1
at the time , @entity8 promised that by spending over $ 800 billion in borrowed money , we would keep unemployment below 8 %			0
had that approach worked , @entity8 would n't have had to make a speech at all yesterday			2
his need to offer a @entity4 moment asking for a rerun of the stimulus blank check reveals just how badly his economic policies have failed -- and just how bereft this administration is of any new ideas to replace them			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity95 .			0

@entity97 says @entity8 jobs speech *reminded* him of film " @entity4 "
he says speech was retread of jobs plans in the 2009 stimulus plan
he says @entity8 vows everything will be paid for , but will let @entity12 figure out how
@entity95 : *strategies* like extending jobless benefits and payroll tax cuts are stale
