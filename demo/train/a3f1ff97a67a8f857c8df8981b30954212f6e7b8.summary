-- at long last , the royal baby has arrived ! the queen can finally depart for her summer holiday at @entity4			2
the paparazzi who have been littering the streets in front of @entity8 can now train their long lenses on a topless ( albeit nursing ) mother			0
to @entity14 and @entity15 , i pass on the most consoling words i received when my daughter was born : the first month of parenthood is n't for the faint - hearted			1
everyone 's got advice for new parents			1
the @entity23 -- we are told -- raise happier and better - behaved children , thanks to their self - assured authority and bans on snacking			0
@entity30 moms , so the legend goes , breed successful children because of rigorous discipline and unflinchingly high standards			0
@entity35 's children prosper because they are deprived of carbohydrates			2
but in a clamorous field of conflicting advice - givers , the members of @entity39 's royal family are notable no - shows			1
while many have an opinion about how the new royal baby should be brought up -- nanny or no nanny , @entity49 and @entity50 or the @entity51 holding grandparently sway -- there is no volley answering back from the @entity53			2
little wonder , since a royal guide to @entity56 sounds like a @entity58 skit , with the dotty royal ancestors alternately misplacing their progeny and browbeating them for breaches of arcane infant protocol			2
' wicked ' author : royal baby stands for hope it 's not that royal parents lack a plan			1
@entity14 and prince @entity15 reportedly want a " normal " childhood for their offspring			1
prince @entity15 's mother , @entity73 , said the same thing			1
for @entity73 , that meant unscheduled playtimes , the occasional meal at @entity78 , nursery school with other children			0
but if a trip for the royal heirs to @entity86 was a novelty , the longing for ordinariness -- or seeming ordinariness -- is in fact a much older aspiration			2
it was prince @entity15 's great - great - great - great - grandmother @entity91 and her @entity93 consort , @entity94 , who recognized the adulation that might be inspired by a royal family ( the term was @entity94 's own coinage ) cast in the mold of middle - class virtues			1
unlike her dissipated uncles , @entity101 and her family would be paragons of bourgeois domesticity			2
@entity94 was present at the birth of his children			2
the education of @entity109 , their second - born son and heir , was approached with the utmost seriousness			0
distrustful of the lax and inattentive royal parents of the past , @entity94 elected to superintend every detail of @entity109 's upbringing himself			1
opinion : why i would n't want to be royal baby still , all of this parental care came , as @entity122 's fascinating new biography of @entity123 reveals , at a high price			1
@entity109 could never live up to his parents ' expectations of him			0
he was rebellious , a slow learner and -- or so his father feared -- marked by the congenital weaknesses in @entity101 's line			0
in the hope of instilling regular habits , @entity94 spied on his son constantly			0
both of his parents issued a constant stream of corrections , @entity138 before the fact			0
" i had no boyhood , " @entity109 later lamented			0
from @entity101 onwards , contemporary claims to normality and ordinariness jostle up against retrospective assessments of secrecy and isolation			0
was @entity49 ' father , prince @entity147 , really doing a " splendidly modern job on the upbringing of his son , " as the @entity151 reported when @entity49 was 13 : " no effete , out - dated @entity152 , with its tailcoats , fancy waistcoats , slender watch chains and high - pitched accents " ? or was young prince @entity49 , as is now often suggested , the hapless victim of distant parents who subjected him to an education unsuited to his personality ? opinion : baby helps make a monarchy better as @entity94 presciently recognized , family life does provide common ground , even a point of identification and sympathy , between royals and their subjects			1
while few live in a castle , the vast majority of us have parents of some sort			0
but contrary to @entity94 's fond hopes , the royal family has proved itself most normal in the late 20th century not by exemplifying middle - class virtues but by enacting the same fallout from the sexual revolution as most other @entity185 families : adultery , divorce , confession and intergenerational conflict			1
that sort of normality , however , does n't endear you to taxpayers			0
for extraordinary people to make themselves ordinary is a conjuring act , one that requires a certain suspension of disbelief on the part of their audience			1
it 's role - playing on our part as well as theirs			0
so , @entity14 and @entity15 : we wish you many perfectly ordinary sleepless nights , changing diapers and worrying over test scores			1
but we 'll only know you 're really normal when you tell the rest of us how to raise a baby -- and , on the basis of results achieved , some are willing to listen			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .			1

@entity218 of @entity219 gave birth to a boy on monday
@entity216 : everyone 's got advice for new parents , but the royal family has been mum
she says @entity14 and prince @entity15 reportedly want a " normal " childhood for their child
@entity216 : for extraordinary people to make themselves ordinary is a conjuring act
