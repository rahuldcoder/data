-- there 's @entity2 , the football player			1
and @entity2 , the man who could soon become the @entity4 's first openly gay player			1
speaking saturday at the @entity7 , the @entity6 star defensive end said he wished reporters would think of him in the former terms and ask him about schemes , his performance and his potential			1
" but , " @entity2 conceded , " it is what it is			2
" and so @entity2 patiently fielded question after question that , directly or indirectly , related to his sexuality and topics such as gay slurs , bullying and more			1
the @entity23 defensive lineman from the @entity6 publicly revealed that he 's gay in an @entity25 interview that aired on february 9			2
the revelation stirred a flurry of talk and debate about whether pro football players would accept a homosexual teammate , and whether @entity2 's announcement could hurt his chances of being drafted and ultimately making a team			1
" i understand how big this is , " @entity2 said then			2
" it 's a big deal			0
no one has done this before			0
and it 's kind of a nervous process , but i know what i want to be ... i want to be a football player in the @entity4			1
" the @entity7 in @entity43 marks a chance for @entity2 , like any other prospect , to be evaluated and answer questions from representatives from the league 's 32 clubs			1
while it started as a behind - the - scenes affair , the combine has transformed into a big event that 's even broadcast extensively for millions of fans to track			0
facing the media is part of that process			0
in his opening comments , @entity2 -- who has since spoken to many other news outlets besides @entity25 -- lightly said that he 'd " shown you guys enough the last couple of weeks			2
but i 'm learning , with the media , that you guys want more			0
" so the questions came , like how he felt about gay slurs flying around among teammates			1
@entity2 responded that he 'd " been in locker rooms with all kinds of slurs ( being ) said , " but did n't take it personally believing that those players using such language were probably " a little naive			1
" but going forward , he expects this to become less of an issue			0
" as time goes on , " @entity2 said , " everyone will adapt			1
" what about joining the @entity75 , which -- according to recently released @entity76 -- had been marred by harassment , offensive language and more involving its offensive line ? if @entity80 drafted him , @entity2 said he would be " excited , " not fearful			2
" i 'm not afraid about going into that ( kind of ) environment , " he added			0
" i know how to handle myself , i know how to communicate with my teammates , i know how to communicate with the coaches and the staff -- whomever i need to communicate with			0
" repeatedly , @entity2 talked about his future in the @entity4 as a player , as much as being a gay role model			1
after all , this past season , he was named the top defensive player in the @entity90 , considered the nation 's best league			0
and teammates named him @entity95 's most valuable player			1
still , there 's no doubt that @entity2 has become a national figure not because of his play , but because he came out			2
not all of the attention has been good , like reports that some teams might avoid drafting him now and that he might not be welcomed in @entity4 locker rooms			0
still , @entity2 insisted saturday , " the positive outweighs the negative			0
" he gave special thanks to members of the @entity95 community -- stating " i am @entity111 , i 'm a @entity112 forever " -- while also expressing appreciation for many more people who he 's never met			2
" i 'm kind of surprised , actually , " @entity2 said			0
" there 's a lot of support , there 's a lot of people who want this			0

@entity2 talks to reporters at the @entity7
he recently came out ; could become @entity4 's first openly gay player
the @entity95 star says he 'd prefer to talk football , " but it is what it is "
of gay slurs , he *predicts* , in time " everyone will adapt "
