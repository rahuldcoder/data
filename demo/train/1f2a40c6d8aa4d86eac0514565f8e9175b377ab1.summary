@entity0 -- " it 's the queen 's diamond jubilee soon ! " i recently babbled excitedly to some of my @entity7 friends			1
" let 's have a party like we did for the royal wedding -- i 'll provide @entity13 hats and streamers , jugs of @entity16 's and a gargantuan amount of chocolate hobnobs ! " there was barely a murmur in response			2
just one year previously , they 'd been a stampede of @entity24 at 5am on my doorstep , desperate to get prime position in front of the television as @entity29 walked up the aisle			1
" you know , the queen ? " i battle on in my local @entity0 coffee shop			2
" @entity34 played her , remember ? she was @entity36 's daughter ? she 's the great - great - granddaughter of @entity37 , when @entity37 was into @entity38 and horses ? " none of my film tidbits cause a swirl of interest , despite my @entity45 crowd			2
in @entity45 years , @entity46 is about 405 -- roughly the same as @entity48 , they imagine -- and far too old to get excited about			2
" will the princes be there ? " one @entity52 chum finally responds			2
" of course ! she 's their grandma ! " i reply indignantly			0
" well , in that case , " she nods , " i 'm sure we 'll all be there			0
any glimpse of those boys is worth getting up early and facing traffic for			0
" i must admit , after living as a @entity63 in @entity7 for seven years , i have found we share surprisingly few traits or interests			1
we @entity66 love @entity67 ; @entity7 have never heard of them			1
we crave a simple hot cup of tea with a splash of milk while they insist on adding ice cubes and a slice of lemon			0
we 're scared of guns , they 're scared of boobs			0
but one place where our old and new world tastes collide is with prince @entity80			1
" do n't you just love him ? " i hear as much as " i love your accent ! " watching my adopted homeland fall under the spell of the young royals has encouraged me to dismiss any cynicism i might have toward them ( paying for a round of shots at @entity90 , are we ? a skiing trip -- how lovely , i wish i could afford to get piste ! ) and embrace the great international marketing campaign they are doing for the @entity96 right now			1
i admit feeling a smug superiority watching @entity99 fawn over @entity29 and @entity100 on their trip to my city last year			1
our future monarch and his mrs. have the x factor -- without the help of publicists , agents or @entity110			0
our history makes them dazzling , our traditions make them awe - inspiring			0
and combining that -- at last ! -- with great bone structure , a sense of humor and the slightly - common touch ( thanks to @entity120 's legacy and high street fashion )			0
the @entity122 and @entity29 and the duke 's naughty little brother are a triumvirate of @entity96 charm , to be exported all over the world as a symbol of our greatness , much like @entity130			1
i love that @entity29 wears the same outfit time after time and does her own supermarket shopping ; i like that @entity133 enjoys a sunday roast round " @entity135 and @entity136 's , " ( his in - laws ) adore @entity80 's incessant need to take the mickey out of his brother , be it wearing a mask of his face on a fun run or asking him embarrassing questions in front of journalists			1
as much as i think the queen has done a brilliant job , and i look forward to celebrating her jubilee with glee , we have the kids to thank for the detoxification of this once staid , fusty old brand			0
and i 'm sure no one would agree more than her majesty			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160 .			1
