-- will young @entity2 voters be as enthusiastic about president @entity4 's re-election as they were about his candidacy four years ago , when 66 % of 18 - to 29 - year - olds favored him over @entity7 ? polls vary widely			1
but a @entity10 survey gives @entity4 only a 7 - point lead over presumptive @entity13 nominee @entity12 among millennials , while a new @entity15 says he has a 17 - point lead -- still a worrisome number for @entity18			2
if 2008 was any indication , an unshakeable youth coalition may be a prerequisite for @entity18 victory			0
the president seems to be listening : he has focused this week on young people , with stops at the @entity26 at @entity27 , the @entity28 and the @entity29 in @entity30			2
but amid this climate of economic gloom , even apocalypse , for millennials , @entity4 is rocking the campus vote ... with the single issue of loans ? this is certainly a salient policy most directly affecting college students and recent graduates today			1
they will see reduced loan rates expire without prompt legislative action			0
and these students undoubtedly will warm , in the short term , to @entity4 's efforts to sustain the current rates			1
however , three and a half years after young voters supported @entity4 as a fixer - in - chief , the economic situation for millennials is in worse shambles , with debt and unemployment climbing for most 18 - to 29 - year - olds			1
more than half of recent graduates are unemployed or underemployed , according to a forthcoming study by @entity57 , says @entity58 of the school 's @entity59			2
gen y , people roughly between the ages of 18 and 34 , may be the first generation since the @entity65 without lasting financial protection			0
this week , trustees of both @entity68 and @entity69 reported that the solvency of both programs is slipping , and lawmakers need to take action quickly			0
a recent @entity79 story said that @entity80 has no safety net for retirement beyond market - driven 401 ( k ) s. on top of that risk , the financial hurdles of student loans , a weak housing market , and high unemployment are shaping this generation 's deficient savings rate			1
this is a chilling glimpse into the extinction of the @entity2 middle - class for most young citizens			0
president @entity4 's narrowly tailored discussion of the loan issue for millennials is not likely to rekindle the " yes , we can " enthusiasm of 2008 or spur effective policy for young people beyond the college years			1
channeling a message of social justice on the loan issue can go only so far			0
there is the wider issue of affordability -- policy that could make college cost - free for middle - income students -- and the fundamental need to improve millennial social mobility			0
to galvanize the youth vote anew in 2012 , when young people 's economic livelihood is at stake , @entity4 will have to reach deeper than loans			1
how about a plan for young @entity2 after college : stronger jobs legislation geared around recent grads ? a proposal to reclaim @entity68 ? the president knows how pivotal the youth vote is for his re-election odds			1
but his bid for a second term will hinge upon across - the - board substantive answers for young people , so their economic situation is not such a raw one			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity132 .			0
