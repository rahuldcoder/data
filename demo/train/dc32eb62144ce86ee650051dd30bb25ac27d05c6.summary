-- in a second @entity4 response to president @entity6 's @entity5 delivered on behalf of @entity8 activists tuesday night , @entity2 rep. @entity1 asserted that " instead of a leaner , smarter government , we bought a bureaucracy that tells us which light bulbs to buy , and which may put 16,500 @entity14 agents in charge of policing president @entity6 's health care bill			1
" fact check : will 16,500 @entity14 agents police the health care bill ? the number seems to have originated in a @entity4 committee report last spring , based on a preliminary estimate from the @entity23 that between $ 5 billion and $ 10 billion would be required to administer the health care bill			1
working backward from the higher @entity23 number , the @entity4 asserted that the money would be spent on 16,500 new @entity14 employees , including " additional auditors , agents and other employees ... " but @entity14 commissioner @entity30 testified to @entity31 in march 2010 that the @entity14 would not audit taxpayers to make sure they have bought health insurance			1
instead , he said @entity14 employees would be focused on making sure the public knew about tax incentives in the legislation			0
@entity30 conceded that some new employees would be required to support the agency 's work on the health care bill			2
but he said during an appearance at the @entity43 in april that he did n't know yet how many			0
the most recent data from the @entity14 , from 2009 , shows that the service has 93,337 employees , of whom 14,264 are revenue agents and an additional 2,725 are special agents			2
that 's a current total of 16,989 agents to handle all investigations and taxpayer audits conducted by the @entity14			0
and @entity1 went further than asserting that 16,500 employees would be hired -- she said 16,500 @entity14 agents may be " in charge of policing " the health care bill			1
but the health care bill specifically says that taxpayers who do not buy insurance " shall not be subject to any criminal prosecution or penalty with respect to such failure			1
" and 16,500 agents would require the @entity14 to almost double its force of agents or divert nearly all its current agents from their existing audit and investigative duties			0
@entity69 seems far - fetched , given the provisions of the health care bill that prohibit criminal prosecution or penalty of taxpayers who do not meet its provisions			2
bottom line : congresswoman @entity1 's assertion is , at best , misleading			0
@entity0 's @entity78 and @entity79 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 says an army of @entity14 agents will be used to *enforce* the health care law
the head of the @entity14 told @entity31 that no taxpayers will be audited under the law
