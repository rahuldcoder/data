@entity1 's fascination with the @entity3 began as a boy in @entity5 , watching cowboy movies on tv			1
" the film ' @entity8 ' with @entity10 in 1963 or ' @entity11 ' with @entity12 ... and ' @entity13 ' with @entity14 as a sort of rodeo rider , " said @entity1			1
" it seemed like another world from sort of drab @entity5			0
" when he turned 17 , @entity1 headed to the @entity20 , where he spent three months hitchhiking his way through the @entity23 states			1
" i just wanted to see things like i 'd seen in films , " he said			0
@entity26 captures the solitude and expanse of places like central @entity30 and @entity31 in his latest photography project , " @entity33 , " which releases in book format in june in the @entity35 and in the fall in the @entity20			1
but do n't expect any romanticized , idyllic scenes in his photography			0
" i preferred the idea of actually slowly looking at the places away from perhaps @entity23 art , " he explained			1
" looking at the the sort of everyday side of things , which i find more interesting			0
" @entity26 began the project seven years ago as the financial crisis began to unfold across the @entity20			2
he said he was surprised by " the scale of development on halt in the towns outside @entity52			2
" he named his photography series " @entity33 " after a phrase he came across during his travels , referring to those living " slightly under the radar " in remote parts of the @entity3			1
social media follow @ @entity60 on @entity61 to join the conversation about photography			0
" some of the parts in ... central @entity30 and central @entity31 , they are as remote as i 've ever been , " @entity1 said			1
" and when you 're traveling 50 miles between almost just a gas station and that 's it , it sort of changes one 's viewpoint of scale and distance			2
" @entity26 spent the early part of his career as a fashion photographer and taking portraits of actors including @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 -- but his heart was n't in it			1
" i was n't really thrilled by the idea of being a fashion photographer , " @entity1 said			1
" after the death of my first wife , it just sort of taught me to do what you want to do , and i go ' ok i want to concentrate on this sort of work			0
' " his images include people and places in faraway towns like @entity96 , @entity31 ; @entity98 , @entity97 ; and @entity99 , @entity100			1
often , @entity26 would determine where he 'd go next by pulling out a map and picking a town that had an interesting name			2
sometimes it worked , sometimes it did n't			0
" i remember looking in @entity100 one time and i came across this town -- i just thought , well it sounds really interesting and it 's in the hills , and it 's called @entity99 , " @entity1 explained			1
" the story of the town itself is quite typical of a lot of those towns : it was nothing , no food , it grew huge and then slowly died off			2
" ( but ) the thing that really fascinated me was the fact that this town was really hanging on ... everything just seemed to click in that town			0
" @entity26 spent one summer traveling with a group of rodeo cowboys , captured in one image simply doing their laundry			1
he said the biggest culture shock of his entire trip happened during the rodeo events			0
" i was surprised by ... the sense that at rodeos , you have the whole idea of prayers			0
it 's such an un-english thing			2
at any sort of sports event ( in @entity5 ) you would n't have a quiet moment and say the @entity136 and ' @entity137 bless the troops ' ... but out there it seemed absolutely standard			0
" out of the thousands of images that he took , @entity26 carefully selected ones he felt embody the real face of the @entity3			1
but he insists that his audience needs to " create their own backstory " about what they are witnessing in his photos			2
" the place has to resonate with me ... there has to have some sort of lyricism or poetry about the image so people can see into it , " he said			0
" there 's no story here so the pictures do n't have to fit in ... these pictures can float around a bit more , they do n't have to fit with a strict text narrative			0
" @entity1 is a fine art photographer and master printer			1
you can follow him on @entity170 and on @entity61 .			0

photographer @entity1 spent three months hitchhiking his way through the @entity23 states
