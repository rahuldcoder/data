at times angry and choked with emotion , secretary of state @entity1 on wednesday took on @entity3 critics of her department 's handling of the september terrorist attack in @entity8 that killed the @entity10 ambassador and three other @entity10 , but repeatedly distanced herself from a direct role in specific situations			1
" as i have said many times since september 11 , i take responsibility , " @entity1 told two long - anticipated congressional hearings examining the attack that became a major issue in the november presidential election			1
conservative republicans challenged @entity1 on the lack of security at the diplomatic compound in @entity24 , where ambassador @entity25 and three others were killed , as well as the erroneous account provided four days later by @entity29 ambassador @entity28 that the attack grew spontaneously from a protest over an anti-islam film produced in the @entity10			1
sen. @entity33 , a tea party backed @entity35 @entity3 serving his first term , persistently questioned @entity1 on wednesday morning about what he described as @entity39 " purposely misleading " the @entity10 people			2
security clearance : @entity1 lays out daunting security challenges in @entity42 " we were misled that there were supposedly protests and something sprang out of that , an assault sprang out of that and that was easily ascertained that that was not the fact , " @entity33 said , adding that " the @entity10 people could have known that within days			1
" shouting and gesturing with her arms in frustration , @entity1 shot back : " with all due respect , the fact is we had four dead @entity10			2
was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they 'd go kill some @entity10 ? " her fists shaking , she continued : " what difference , at this point , does it make ? it is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again , senator			0
" five things we learned from the @entity24 hearings later @entity33 , interviewed by @entity75 's @entity74 , said he still did not think @entity1 answered his question			1
" the @entity10 people also have the right to be told the truth , " said @entity33			0
" they have an expectation that this administration , this president will be honest with them			0
and so it makes a big deal of difference			0
i 'll tell you what , i was surprised by @entity1 's reaction to that			1
" another conservative , sen. @entity91 of @entity92 , told @entity1 she should have been fired for not reading cables from @entity25 and others in @entity8			1
later in the day , conservative @entity3 rep. @entity96 of @entity97 accused @entity1 of " national security malpractice " by letting the @entity24 consulate " become a death trap			2
" @entity96 also questioned @entity1 's claim of taking responsibility , noting she still had her job and the @entity106 officials cited for culpability by an independent review also remained on the payroll , though on forced leave pending possible further steps			1
# whatdifferencedoesitmake : @entity1 quote goes viral on twitter at both hearings , which together totaled more than five hours , @entity1 acknowledged the " systemic breakdown " cited by an @entity116 she appointed and noted she had accepted all 29 of its recommendations , adding her department was taking additional steps to increase security at @entity10 diplomatic facilities around the world			1
however , she also told both the @entity125 and @entity126 that she had no direct role in the handling of requests by @entity25 and other diplomats for increased security that were denied , saying : " i did n't see those requests			2
they did n't come to me			0
" in reference to the erroneous talking points by @entity39 that were aired on september 16 , @entity1 told the @entity125 panel that she was focused at that time on ensuring the safety of @entity10 personnel at other facilities where protests were taking place			1
" i was pretty occupied about keeping our people safe , doing what needed to be done , " @entity1 said , adding " i was n't involved in the talking points process			2
" ticker : what @entity24 hearing could say about 2016 @entity148 at one point , @entity1 attempted to wrap up the issue , saying : " if you wish to fault the administration , it 's that we did n't have a clear picture , and we probably did n't do as clear a job explaining that we did not have a clear picture , until days later , creating what i think are legitimate questions			2
" the independent report from the review board said it did not find " that any individual @entity10 government employee engaged in misconduct or willfully ignored his or her responsibilities " leading up to the attack			0
however , one @entity106 official resigned and three others were placed on administrative leave after the report was released in december			0
one of the @entity3 's harshest critics of the administration over the @entity24 attack , sen. @entity170 of @entity171 , called @entity1 's testimony unsatisfactory			1
@entity33 says he should not have ' speculated ' about @entity1 's emotional moments he said her department had yet to fully disclose all e-mails and other communication from @entity25 and others in @entity24 , noting the @entity10 people , including the family and loved ones of those killed , deserved full answers			1
critics also complain the assailants remain at large , and @entity1 noted that " we continue to hunt the terrorists responsible for the attacks in @entity24 and are determined to bring them to justice			0
" she told wednesday 's hearings that the @entity193 is pursuing what she called " very positive leads			0
" in her opening statement to both panels , @entity1 said the @entity24 attack did n't happen in a vacuum but was part of a " broader strategic challenge in @entity42 and the wider region			0
" @entity1 's @entity24 statement : ' not just a matter of policy -- it 's personal ' she defended her department 's response , saying there was " timely " and " exceptional " coordination between the @entity106 and the @entity212 on the night of the attack " no delays in decision making			1
no denials of support from @entity217 or from the military , " @entity1 said			0
the review panel 's report " said our response saved @entity10 lives in real time -- and it did , " she added			0
@entity1 also said she directed the response to the attack from the @entity106 that night and " stayed in close contact with officials from across our government and the @entity8 government			1
" in addition , @entity1 said she immediately took steps to beef up security at @entity10 posts around the world and to implement the review panel 's 29 recommendations			1
@entity1 made clear that the security situation in @entity42 and the @entity241 remained threatening in the wake of the @entity244 upheaval , with longtime leaders ousted in @entity246 , @entity247 and @entity8			1
the fledgling @entity8 leadership turned out to be unable to fulfill traditional security commitments to the @entity10 diplomatic compound , she said			2
opinion : @entity24 blame game is useless " what i found with the @entity8 was willingness but not capacity , " she said			2
@entity1 also warned that weapons from @entity8 have turned up in @entity259 and elsewhere , adding that " this @entity262 if you will " represented a major security threat			1
" @entity244 has ushered in a time when @entity264 is on the rise , " she said			0
" the world in many ways is even more dangerous because we lack a central command [ in @entity264 ] and have instead these nodes that are scattered throughout @entity42 and other places			0
" @entity1 expressed particular concern at events in @entity274 , where well - armed @entity276 militia , who had been working for former @entity8 leader @entity278 , came home just as @entity280 ( @entity280 ) gravitated toward the area			1
the size and topography of northern @entity274 , with its endless desert and caves , made for a long but necessary struggle , she said , adding that " we can not permit northern @entity274 to become a safe haven			0
" opinion : @entity91 vs. @entity1 , clash of titans overall , she said , at least 20 @entity10 diplomatic outposts " are under a serious threat environment as i speak to you			0
" wednesday 's committee appearances were some of the last acts for @entity1 before she leaves her post as long planned , and @entity1 showed a personal side in discussing what happened			1
" for me , this is not just a matter of policy , " she told the @entity125 panel			0
" in reference to the return of remains of the four slain @entity10 , @entity1 said in a voice choked with emotion : " i stood next to president @entity312 as the @entity313 carried those flag - draped caskets off the plane at @entity316			0
i put my arms around the mothers and fathers , sisters and brothers , sons and daughters			0
" democrats on both panels made a point of praising @entity1 's service and noted that @entity148 @entity3 have voted to cut funding for diplomatic security			1
however , @entity3 rejected any connection between budget resources and vulnerability at the @entity24 compound , citing a report by a @entity106 financial officer			0
@entity1 faces hearings with numbers on her side the hearings provided @entity3 with a final opportunity to question @entity1 , considered a possible presidential contender in 2016 , on camera before she leaves office			2
after the september attack , conservative @entity3 focused on the issue to attack the @entity312 administration 's handling of the @entity8 revolution and the overall @entity244 upheaval			2
several legislators made references on wednesday to @entity1 's possible political future , with @entity3 @entity353 of @entity354 drawing a laugh from the secretary when he said : " i wish you the best in your future endeavors			1
" polls show strong public support for @entity1 and her performance as secretary of state , with an @entity368 / @entity367 survey released wednesday showing 67 % of respondents had a favorable impression of her			1
@entity1 was originally scheduled to testify last month but postponed her appearance as she was treated for illness , a concussion and a blood clot near her brain			2
the country 's top diplomat returned to work just over two weeks ago			0
@entity212 releases official timeline of @entity24 attack			0
