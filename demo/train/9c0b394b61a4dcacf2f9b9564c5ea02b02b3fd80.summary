-- the great @entity2 talking shop is now up and running , with delegates of all levels of importance , shapes and nationalities zeroing in on this quaint , alpine town to put the world to rights			1
for many ordinary people the annual meeting of the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) is yet another " important " summit in the calendar where the elite of business and politics will schmooze for a few days in a rarefied environment they have little or no experience of			1
whether or not you believe events such as @entity2 justify their lofty ambitions , they are certainly a unique experience			1
so how do you become a @entity2 delegate ? @entity28 invite the @entity12 is strictly by invitation only , with 2,500 participants representing over 100 countries			1
the roll call includes @entity33 and representatives from the world 's biggest corporations ; politicians and heads of state from the @entity39 and other key countries ; technology innovators ; social entrepreneurs ; philanthropists and media companies			0
adding to the exclusivity is the hefty price tag to attend			0
while the white badges are free for invited representatives of certain groups -- heads of state , faith leaders , academics , social entrepreneurs , members of international organizations and news anchors -- for businesses , the cost of a ticket is approximately $ 20,000			1
huge travel budget getting to this small ski resort , nestled in a picturesque valley high up in the @entity62 150 km south - west of @entity59 , is not for the budget traveler			1
for a delegate arriving from @entity66 this week flying business class , the price comes in at between $ 4,800 and $ 7,200			1
a visitor from @entity69 can expect to pay between $ 4,500 and $ 8,300 , while a delegate flying in from @entity71 , @entity72 will pay around $ 4,900			1
and once in @entity59 there 's the small matter of the transfer to @entity2			1
a regular shuttle bus and train service is available , but a two - hour trip by public transport may not suit the business client			2
the alternative would be a limousine which would cost around $ 700 for a one - way trip			1
however corporate ceos may choose to come by helicopter , which last year cost around $ 9,500 for a return flight			1
place to stay finding accommodation in @entity2 during the week of the @entity12 is not easy , with a limited number of large hotels			1
predictably tariffs reflect the resulting demand / supply imbalance , with a room in a modest three - star hotel coming in at around $ 600 per night			2
those with a considerably bigger budget often choose to rent out whole apartments or chalets			0
a chalet sleeping up to ten people for the week can command as much as $ 60,000 - though catering might just be included			0
the right outfit it 's cold in @entity2 , very cold			2
at 5,052 ft ( 1,540m ) above see level , temperatures average -6 degrees @entity105 ( 21.1 degrees @entity106 ) in january			0
thermal underwear , winter jackets and snow boots are a must , particularly when the temperature plummets in the evenings as you make your way to the various cocktail parties , meals and social events hosted by partner companies			0
it is not uncommon to see $ 2,000 bespoke suits finished off with bulky snow boots around the @entity123			0
spot the @entity124 for an outsider , the gathering in @entity2 might look like a big party for anyone who matters in the world			2
in reality , the meeting in @entity2 is ruled by a strict hierarchy			2
access to some places is strictly for a a few dozens of heads of state , royalty , the @entity33 of global corporate giants and the heads of a veritable alphabet soup of international organizations			0
how do you spot the very , very important people among the 2,500 delegates ? look for the badges			0
anyone wearing a white badge is an official delegate , who got invited to the conference			0
spouses of delegates and " strategic partners , " who sponsor the @entity12 , have similar badges			1
the most exclusive badge , the kind that gets you access to the behind the scenes secret society ( officially known as the @entity158 ) , is the one with a holographic sticker			0
knowing where to go with all the above boxes ticked , it is essential to have a plan once you have run the gauntlet of airport - style security -- there are 4,000 @entity62 troops in @entity2 this week -- and made it inside the newly - extended @entity123 with the correct color of identity pass			2
some delegates do nothing but network with other delegates , oblivious to the feverish discussions going all around them about the post-crisis new reality			0
so delegates can spend four days roaming this cavernous indoor amphitheater attending conferences and workshops about everything from how the environment agenda will change in light of current trends and norms , to how music can transform communities and unite people			0
$ 40,000 - per head well spent			0
