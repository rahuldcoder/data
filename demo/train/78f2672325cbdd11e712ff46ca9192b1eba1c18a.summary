@entity1 prime minister @entity0 expressed optimism late wednesday that the @entity1 people , in a vote to be held as soon as december 4 , will support his plan to remain in the euro zone despite having to endure the austerity measures that @entity1 's continued membership in the euro club would require			1
" i believe the @entity1 people want us to be a strong partner in the euro zone , a strong partner in @entity19 , and this is at stake , " @entity0 told reporters who had assembled for the @entity12 meeting in @entity13 , @entity14			1
" this is at stake , " he repeated			0
his optimism came in the face of an unveiled threat			0
if the referendum fails , @entity1 may be kicked out of the euro zone , @entity14 president @entity27 told reporters in a separate news conference in this chic resort town on @entity14 's southern coast			1
if @entity1 opts not to adhere to a deal reached on october 27 , then it must leave the euro zone , @entity27 said after meeting for more than two hours with @entity0 and @entity37 chancellor @entity36			1
but @entity0 said the referendum -- whose wording he would not discuss -- would prove key			1
" i want to say that we will have a yes , " he said			0
but first , @entity0 faces a confidence vote , slated for friday , that will determine his own political fate			2
" this is our first battle , " he said			0
asked whether he believed he would win , he said , " i do hope so but , obviously , this is a democratic process			0
" @entity27 said the ministers of finance of @entity14 and @entity37 will meet wednesday			1
the countries are determined to help @entity1 , but require that @entity1 meet its commitments , he said , adding that the other members of the euro zone would not allow the euro to be destroyed			1
@entity1 authorities were informed that @entity19 and the @entity54 would disburse a sixth tranche of $ 8 billion euros only after the uncertainty is ended and the october 27 deal is implemented , @entity27 said			1
@entity1 is now in the last third of its may 2010 bailout , which is worth a total of 110 billion euros			2
in a statement , @entity54 managing director @entity62 lauded the october 27 plan , despite its belt - tightening requirements			0
" i remain convinced that the agreement reached by the leaders of the @entity68 at their summit last week , which includes a substantive reduction in @entity1 's debt burden and additional financial support for a new ambitious program , will greatly benefit @entity1 by helping to restore growth and create jobs , " @entity62 said			1
she said she welcomed @entity0 's indication that the referendum would be held as soon as possible			1
" as soon as the referendum is completed , and all uncertainty removed , i will make a recommendation to the @entity81 regarding the sixth tranche of our loan to support @entity1 's economic program , " she said			1
asked whether withholding of the tranche would bankrupt @entity1 , @entity0 said , " if everything goes well in the referendum , it 's quite a few days before the sixth tranche is needed to pay up salaries and pensions and so on			1
" @entity0 did not attend the news conference at which his @entity14 and @entity37 counterparts spoke			1
the tense times in @entity13 came on the same day that @entity1 's cabinet voted to support @entity0 's call for a referendum on the bailout plan			1
the vote was unanimous , though some of the ministers expressed criticism prior to casting their votes , @entity101 affiliate @entity100 reported			0
@entity37 and @entity14 markets rallied wednesday after tumbling tuesday on the news of the referendum call , and @entity111 's @entity110 also closed slightly higher			1
the @entity113 index closed up 178 points ( 1.53 % )			0
@entity0 is seeking public backing from the @entity1 people for last week 's bailout deal , an accord that took months to craft			1
but the move has created turmoil in domestic politics and angered his @entity19 counterparts			0
a " no " vote could not only force @entity1 to abandon the euro but could send shock waves through the global financial system			1
@entity1 foreign minister @entity127 told @entity101 he was confident the @entity1 people would vote yes			2
" everyone is getting a bit tired of doubting the wisdom of the @entity1 people and their commitment to @entity19 , " he said , adding that @entity1 had proven its dedication in the painful measures it has already taken			2
@entity135 president @entity134 appealed wednesday for national and political unity , saying it would be " critically important to have stability " for the bailout deal to be implemented			0
" without the agreement of @entity1 to the @entity144 / @entity54 program , the conditions for @entity1 citizens would become much more painful , in particular for the most vulnerable			2
the consequences would be impossible to foresee , " he warned			0
last week 's deal would halve the country 's sky - high debts , but at a price that has led to angry demonstrations in the streets of @entity1			2
@entity154 , an economics adviser to @entity155 , a global analysis firm , said @entity0 's referendum call was " almost inevitable , given that the @entity1 population has continued to protest heavily against the plans agreed ( to ) in @entity160			1
" but she said the @entity1 people are aware that they would suffer greater financial pain if the country defaults			0
meanwhile , several senior military leaders in @entity1 have been replaced			0
the @entity165 , which @entity0 chairs , decided tuesday on " sweeping changes in the armed forces ' leadership , " the @entity164 reported			0
the council replaced the general staff chiefs for the @entity1 army , navy and air force , the news agency said			0
though the government said it was a long - planned , routine move , its sudden announcement after an extraordinary meeting with the heads of the armed forces makes many dubious , said @entity181 , an assistant professor of politics at the @entity183 in the @entity184			0
politicians have kept a tight rein on the @entity1 armed forces since a seven - year military junta was brought to an end in 1974 , @entity181 said , but people 's memories are long			2
he speculated that the government acted to allay any concern that the military -- which seized power in 1967 as the country was anticipating an election -- might be planning to repeat history			0
" people want to be on the safe side and try to prevent even worse things happening , " he said			0
he added that the news media had not treated it as a major event given the ongoing political and economic crisis			0
but the news of the bailout referendum rattled @entity0 's hold on power tuesday , when a lawmaker defected from his party , leaving him with a majority of only two in @entity214			1
@entity215 said @entity0 had made " an erroneous political decision " in calling for the referendum			2
" it jeopardizes the efforts and the painful sacrifices that are made by the @entity1 people , " she told @entity101 on wednesday			0
@entity27 and @entity36 issued a terse statement tuesday saying they were " determined to ensure the full implementation , without delay , of decisions adopted by the summit , which are necessary now more than ever			0
" in the @entity229 , @entity228 press secretary @entity227 struck a similar note , saying @entity0 's move reinforced the need for @entity19 to " implement rapidly the decisions they made last week			2
" @entity1 's former deputy finance minister , @entity234 , a member of the opposition @entity235 who is not currently in office , told @entity101 he doubted the referendum would take place			1
@entity0 is under enormous pressure from @entity19 , the markets and opposition forces within @entity1 to backtrack on the proposal , @entity234 said			1
he suggested @entity0 would have to call elections or stand down as leader , as @entity1 was " not governable " with him as prime minister			1
@entity1 's opposition leader , @entity248 , called tuesday for a snap election , but it is unlikely he has the votes to force one			1
international lenders are demanding that @entity254 raise taxes , sell off state - owned companies and slash government spending , which would mean firing tens of thousands of state workers			0
the deal would wipe out 100 billion euros in @entity1 debt , half of what it owes to private creditors , and comes with a promise of 30 billion euros from the public sector to help pay off some of the remaining debts , making the whole deal worth 130 billion euros ( $ 178 billion )			0
the deal was greeted last week with fanfare as a way to keep debt woes in @entity1 and other @entity19 nations from spilling across other borders , threatening the 17 nations united under the euro currency			2
a weekend survey in @entity1 found nearly 60 % opposed the debt deal , but other surveys have shown a more complicated picture			0
a survey carried out last week by @entity282 for the @entity1 daily newspaper to @entity284 showed a majority of @entity1 wanted a referendum on the international rescue plan , and that more would oppose it than accept it			2
but in the same survey , 70 % of @entity1 wanted to stay in the euro , according to @entity290 -- a result that may not be possible if they vote " no " on the referendum			1
besides the @entity1 debt - reduction plan , last week 's @entity144 deal pledged to quadruple the @entity144 's bailout fund to about $ 1.38 trillion and to raise the capital required to help cushion the region 's banks from financial shocks .			2

@entity0 speaks to media gathered for @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14
@entity0 believes @entity1 " want us to be a strong partner "
@entity27 : if referendum fails , @entity1 may be kicked out of the euro zone
@entity1 's cabinet voted to support the call for a referendum
