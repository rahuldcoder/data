-- when @entity2 first arrived in @entity3 , he took one look at his surroundings and thought , " this is a death trap			1
" he would soon learn just how right he was			1
@entity7 was a sitting target for nearby @entity9 insurgents : it sat deep within a valley , surrounded by mountains			1
the @entity14 soldiers stationed there knew it was only a matter of time before something bad happened			1
" we just did n't know when , " @entity2 said			2
when it did , the assault would set in motion a chaotic chain of events that had every soldier certain he would not make it out alive			2
eight @entity14 soldiers died on october 3 , 2009			1
many of the 45 others who survived , including @entity2 , struggle with the guilt that they could n't save more lives			1
yet @entity2 's daring efforts to rescue his fellow soldiers in the face of imminent death earned him the nation 's highest military decoration , the @entity35 , which he will receive on monday at a @entity37 ceremony			1
now staff sgt. @entity38 , 33 , will join another survivor of that battle , former army staff sgt. @entity39 , who received the award earlier this year			1
it marks the first time in nearly half a century that two living soldiers from the same battle received the @entity35			1
to @entity2 , it 's a bittersweet award			1
" it just brings back all those memories of what he had to go through , " explained his wife , @entity47			2
discharged from the @entity52 @entity2 was a loner as a teenager			2
he did n't have a lot of friends			2
his older brother @entity57 had a knack for getting into trouble , and @entity38 followed in his footsteps for awhile before his mother kicked @entity57 out of the house			1
not exactly hero material , he says			2
@entity2 joined the @entity52 in 1998 , spending five years in the service until a fight with a roommate led to his demotion			2
two months later , he was honorably discharged			2
so , it was back to civilian life , something that left @entity2 restless and bored			2
he bounced across the country from job to job : more than a dozen stints in five years , everything from a yacht repairman to a tow - truck operator			2
he was supporting his daughter after his first marriage ended			2
but in every job , something was always missing			2
" there was no motivation , there was no purpose , " @entity2 said			2
" it felt like i was a drone			2
" he hated the punch - in - punch - out lifestyle of making ends meet , and fondly recalled military life			2
" i was thinking ' well man , back in the service ... i was doing what i enjoyed and i was actually happy to wake up in the morning , happy to go to work , ' " he said			2
so he enlisted in the @entity95 in 2008			0
but military life was n't the idyllic place he remembered			0
" we had a platoon full of guys that were on a lighter side of life ( who ) liked to joke around , " retired sgt. 1st class @entity98 recalled			1
" and @entity2 never really got involved ... he thought it was immature			0
" @entity2 really did n't make friends with a lot of guys , and he struggled with it			0
" a little over a year after he enlisted , @entity2 and his platoon were deployed to eastern @entity3 in may 2009			1
despite his aloofness toward his fellow soldiers , @entity2 would find himself in a situation where he did n't think twice to risk his life for those men whose jokes he once found childish			1
defining moment @entity7 had been built in @entity121 in 2006 as part of the effort by @entity125 - led forces to build partnerships with local @entity3 , and try to stop insurgents from trickling over in nearby @entity128			1
the camp had experienced ups and downs since that time and by 2008 , the cavalry commanders in charge of the outpost thought it made sense to shut it down			0
yet there were other factors at play			0
@entity3 's president @entity139 was in the middle of his re-election campaign in fall 2009 , and abandoning @entity7 might have been seen as a lack of @entity14 support			1
so , despite numerous warnings , gen. @entity144 -- then commander of all @entity14 troops in @entity3 -- kept the outpost open			0
after @entity139 's victory and the end of a military operation that freed some key assets , the military leadership approved a plan to abandon the outpost and the troops stationed there were to start packing up on october 4 , 2009			1
instead , a day before their planned departure , an assault was unleashed on the outpost that culminated in what has now been described as one of the most intense battles of the entire war in @entity3			0
the first shots rang out just a few minutes before 6 a.m. the rumors that the soldiers had heard for months were coming true			1
@entity2 said he had often imagined that day			0
" i was like , ' well , if it 's my time to go , how am i going out ? ' " he said			0
the @entity9 had studied how the @entity14 responded to previous attacks , and they knew the outpost relied heavily on its mortars			0
so they made the big guns their first target			0
" when the enemy were n't shooting at us , they were shooting at the weapons , " @entity2 said			0
" so they were disabling the weapons			0
" the insurgent fire killed @entity181			0
@entity182 as he raced to his post			0
sgt. @entity184 was killed while returning fire			1
" you could hear the rounds coming in from every direction , " said platoon sgt. @entity186			1
troops begin running much - needed ammunition to the men on guard duty			0
sgt. @entity194 was gunned down 10 feet outside one of the outpost 's doors			1
in the midst of the gunfire , sgt. @entity202 " immediately ran out the door without hesitation , " @entity98 said			1
" he did n't make it back " ammunition was starting to run out , so @entity38 and other members of his @entity207 troop volunteered to deliver more -- a hundred yards away across the heaviest of gunfire			1
@entity2 did n't think twice about the danger			0
all he knew was there were three fellow soldiers -- sgt. @entity212 , spc. @entity213 and sgt. @entity214 -- trapped in a humvee and they needed more supplies to return fire			1
" @entity2 's kinda like			0
. for lack of a better word , a robot , " @entity98 said			0
" you tell him to do something , he 's gon na do it and he 's gon na do it to the best of his ability			0
" he would return through that deadly gauntlet three times to get supplies to the men			0
when the firefight was over , the death toll would include @entity213 , @entity214 , sgt. @entity235 , and staff sgt. @entity236			1
the names of all eight men who died on that day are engraved on a steel band that @entity2 wears on his wrist , not that he needs the reminder			0
read more about the battle from @entity244 's " the outpost " farm life today , @entity2 still struggles with the memories of the battle , seeking solace with his wife and three children on their farm in @entity252 near @entity253 , where he is now stationed			1
in the dark , quiet moments , the constant ringing in his head brings back difficult thoughts			0
" that 's when the memories start kicking in and you ca n't sleep because , you know , the whole , ' i shoulda done this , i coulda done that , ' " he said			0
" and then you see the faces of the soldiers that died			1
" @entity2 said he believes that one more name should be added to the death toll of the battle of @entity272 : @entity273 , who struggled with drug abuse and mental problems after surviving the battle			1
he left the army with severe ptsd and died in september 2010 after a fatal overdose of methadone and @entity281			0
while there was no evidence of a suicide , @entity273 's friends -- including @entity2 -- believe his death was linked to the battle			1
" i honestly believe that , yes , he was the ninth victim of @entity7 , " @entity2 said			1
" and i also believe that he wo n't be the last			0
" @entity2 also struggles with @entity278 , and now has regular therapy			0
" i did n't believe it was real until i experienced it , " he said of @entity278			0
" i thought it was just an excuse to get out of duty ... but once it hit me , and i realized it , i was blown away			0
how could i be so ignorant ? " @entity2 wants to be a voice to destigmatize these invisible wounds of war , and he hopes that the attention he receives with the @entity35 will show that there is nothing weak in seeking help			1
" what we need to do is take the first few steps , " @entity2 said			0
" we need to realize that yes , this is affecting me , and i need to fix this			0
" @entity0 's @entity310 , @entity311 and @entity312 contributed to this report .			1
