@entity0 -- the federal budget has always been a tool for partisanship , but never more so than in the past few years			1
like the awkward and irreverent distant relative at the dinner table , the @entity5 tried for several years to ignore it			1
but everyone knew it was in the room , helping to create a permanent state of partisan gridlock			0
but the government shutdown in october caused so much political fallout that most republicans and @entity17 in a @entity18 already rated poorly by the public did n't want to go through it again with midterm election campaigns just getting off the ground			1
passing a budget became an imperative			2
two ideologically opposite lawmakers agreed to the same spending plan -- a notable feat considering @entity18 has lurched from fiscal crisis to fiscal crisis since president @entity30 took office , deeply at odds over taxes and spending			0
perhaps more miraculously , the @entity35 , which has been the hotbed of partisans , passed the two - year budget plan last week overwhelmingly before leaving town for the holidays			2
republicans and @entity17 supported the deal , even though neither side swooned			2
some of the most liberal and conservative members opposed it			0
but for the first time in years , a core of the @entity35 came together to support federal spending			2
the vote was 332 - 94			2
the proposal then traveled across the marble corridor of the @entity52 to the @entity5 , where bipartisanship is usually more common			1
but this is where the whole thing gets more difficult due to arcane rules of the @entity5 , political realities ahead of midterms and the 2016 presidential race , concerns about spending , and a bruising fight over how the @entity5 operates that has sharpened partisan feelings			1
@entity5 supporters think they have votes most insiders believe the bill that aims to avert a possible shutdown in mid january , relax sweeping spending cuts under the so - called sequester , and give everyone some political breathing room from the issue for two years , will ultimately pass and be sent to @entity30 for his signature			1
those chances seemed to improve by the hour on monday as supporters gained some conservative backing needed to clear a 60 - vote procedural hurdle on tuesday			1
still , there are a number of republicans who oppose the measure and nothing 's certain yet			0
a confluence of factors -- both relating to the budget and not -- will influence the outcome			2
here 's how things look : 1			0
2014 reelection worries the numbers tell the story			2
seven of the 12 @entity94 running for re-election next year are facing primary challenges from the right			0
and that list includes the top two republicans : minority leader @entity100 of @entity101 and minority whip @entity102 of @entity103			0
@entity104 will not vote for the agreement			2
some major conservative groups have criticized the budget agreement , including @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , and @entity112			2
they are influential with tea party activists and other grassroots advocates who vote in big numbers in the @entity118 primaries -- aka , the kind of voters these @entity94 will need to win reelection			2
i think the primary challenges and the threat of future primary challenges is a factor when senators go to the floor to vote			2
it may not be the biggest factor , but to ignore the impact of primaries would be silly , " said @entity130 , political editor of the non-partisan @entity131			0
one other factor that could be at play when it comes to senators in the @entity94 leadership : this is not their deal			1
there is not @entity5 equivalent to the agreement struck by @entity147 chairman @entity146 and his @entity5 counterpart , democrat @entity148			1
2016 politics sentiments of those same @entity118 primary voters could be why three @entity94 not up for re-election in 2014 quickly opposed the deal last week			1
@entity154 of @entity155 , @entity156 of @entity101 , and @entity157 of @entity103 are all considered possible contenders for the 2016 @entity118 presidential nomination			2
because of that , just about every vote they take will be scrutinized by outside conservative groups influential with core voters in presidential primaries and caucuses			0
@entity167 says 2014 and 2016 politics is a factor when it comes to @entity5 @entity118 opposition			1
" a handful of members of the @entity5 are vying for the presidency in years to come and thinking about this vote in the context			1
and others are frankly afraid of this new force , the @entity180 force , the @entity182 force , that is threatening seven out of the 12 @entity118 senators running for re-election , " @entity167 told " @entity185			0
" do n't expect @entity186 to totally change his tune 3			0
read the bill members on both sides of the aisle are n't enthusiastically supporting the budget deal -- a good sign that it is a true compromise			1
on the left , some are opposed to the fact that it does n't include an extension of unemployment benefits , cutting off 1.3 million @entity199 three days after @entity200			0
" it 's really unconscionable , " sen. @entity201 of @entity202 said on @entity202 last week			0
on the right , @entity118 oppose the amount of government spending			0
it preserved about 60 % of the automatic sequester cuts that went into effect in march , reducing them by about $ 45 billion			0
with proposed federal spending at $ 1.012 trillion for this fiscal year and $ 1.014 for next , some @entity118 say that 's too high			0
" i 'd really like to stay within the ( spending ) caps , " complained sen. @entity214 , an @entity215 @entity118 about limits imposed by a 2011 budget law			0
others oppose cuts to military retiree pensions as a way to save money			0
" we need to find a better way to save $ 6 billion than take it out of the hides of our retired veterans , " said sen. @entity225 , @entity226 , who said he would vote against the bill			0
opinion : @entity30 's very tough year 4			0
filibuster fallout after @entity17 changed the @entity5 rules to weaken the ability of minority republicans to block presidential appointments , the @entity94 may not be in the mood to play nice			1
the @entity5 was locked in fierce partisan bickering over this while the @entity35 was passing the budget			1
angry over the rules change , @entity118 took advantage of @entity5 procedure and forced two consecutive all - night sessions , an attempt to prove a point and annoy @entity17			1
senate majority leader @entity249 responded to @entity118 tactics by telling them he ca n't " heal hurt feelings " and said he would press forward to pass the budget and other items before the waning time left before @entity200			1
" i understand that @entity118 are still upset , " @entity249 told reporters last week			0
" i ca n't wave a magic wand and heal hurt feelings , but i can appeal to my colleagues to be reasonable and work with us and to schedule votes in a timely manner on the important work we have left to do			1
" republicans , who do n't love the budget deal , might feel like making things a little more difficult			1
fears of another shutdown the 16 - day government shutdown was a political disaster for the @entity94			1
conservative @entity118 triggered the political debacle by insisting that money to fund the government be tied to defunding @entity273 , which they despise			0
the public mainly blamed them , and their poll numbers quickly dropped in the so - called generic ballot , a key 2014 metric in the battle for control of @entity18			0
republicans currently control the @entity35 and @entity17 , the @entity5			1
many @entity118 lawmakers are quietly worried the @entity94 brand would suffer further damage if they take the blame for another shutdown even though @entity17 and @entity30 have their own problems with voter sentiment on their job performance			0
opinion : @entity17 lose on budget deal @entity146 , in touting his deal on sunday , highlighted that " we 're preventing two government shutdowns from possibly occurring			1
" @entity118 say they plan to campaign against the @entity273 health reforms under the @entity273 as they work next year to try and regain the @entity5 , which @entity17 hold by 10 seats and keep their double - digit majority in the @entity35			1
another government shutdown would sidetrack them from their mission			1
" @entity17 political strategists would like nothing more than for the @entity94 to take the focus off @entity273 again and to shoot themselves in the foot with another government shutdown , " said @entity299 , a @entity94 strategist and communications director for the @entity301 in the 2010 and 2012 election cycles			1
" this agreement takes that scenario off the table and keeps the @entity17 firmly on defense with their disastrous healthcare law heading into 2014			0
" 5 reasons why @entity18 might ( finally ) pass a budget @entity1 's @entity315 contributed to this report			0

the @entity5 is expected to take up the budget on tuesday
2014 and 2016 politics will play into @entity5 budget vote
the fallout from the filibuster rule change has left hard feelings in the @entity5
fear of another government shutdown has pushed some to support the deal
