@entity1 , @entity2 the captain of the @entity5 is guilty of manslaughter and other charges related to the ship 's fatal wreck in january 2012 off the @entity11 coast , a judge announced wednesday night , capping a tumultuous 19 - month trial and providing a little more closure for dozens of grieving families			1
lengthy trial or not , the three - judge panel needed only about five hours to decide the fate of @entity18			2
their choices : agree with prosecutors who cast the captain as an " idiot " who abandoned ship like a coward , or with defense lawyers who characterized him as a " scapegoat " who ended up in a lifeboat only because he lost his balance and fell into it			0
the judges apparently sided with prosecutors , and sentenced @entity35 to spend 16 years in prison and to pay court costs			1
it could have been worse			0
the former captain faced a possible sentence of 26 years behind bars for convictions for causing a maritime disaster , abandoning ship and multiple counts of manslaughter			1
the nightmare will never end for the families of those 32 people who died after the cruise ship , captained by @entity35 , crashed into rocks off the @entity53 island of @entity54			1
and for a while , it may have seemed like @entity35 's trial would n't end either			2
over the past two years , the judges heard from a wide variety of witnesses , including passengers , crew members and technical experts			2
those testifying included the captain 's female guest on the cruise , @entity68 , a @entity69 dancer who testified that she was in a romantic relationship with @entity35 and that she was with him on the bridge when the accident occurred			2
@entity35 admitted to the court that his reason for sailing close to @entity54 -- leading the ship to hit rocks -- was to " impress the passengers			1
" just before the judges got the case , the captain took the opportunity to speak again			0
breaking down in tears , @entity35 recalled that january day three years ago			1
" i died along with the 32 others , " he said			2
and since then , @entity35 insisted , he 's become a victim , processed by a " media meat grinder			1
" @entity35 's lead lawyer , @entity86 , began closing arguments monday , saying the @entity89 bottle used to christen the ship when it was put into service in 2006 did not break			1
" everything about this ship and this process since then has been a mystery so far , " he said			0
@entity86 addressed each of the charges against the captain , starting with the count of causing a shipwreck and maritime disaster			0
he said helmsman @entity102 allegedly did not understand @entity103 -- a language he was required to speak -- when @entity35 gave the orders to turn the ship away from the island			1
therefore , the attorney argued , @entity102 caused the accident -- not @entity35			2
@entity102 was subpoenaed to testify , but his last known address was in @entity111 , and he could not be forced to come to the court in @entity2			0
@entity35 's defense also hinged on alleged malfunctions of the ship 's equipment and infrastructure , including claims that the ship had faulty watertight doors and generators , and that the elevators did not work when the ship was listing			1
these claims were hard to verify because much of the ship was immersed off the coast of @entity54 for many months after the accident			0
" everything that did not work on the ship is part of the cause of the accident , " @entity86 told the court			0
" lights did n't work			0
" @entity86 ripped the prosecutor , who referred to @entity35 as an " idiot " in his closing arguments last week			2
the lawyer offered one last defense of his client wednesday , even as he said it would be " easier to fly than defend @entity35 , " given all the barbs directed his way by the cruise ship company and media who " needed a scapegoat			1
" " in these three years , " @entity86 said , " @entity35 has suffered the same as a 30 - year sentence			1
" @entity86 tried to explain why his client left the ship ahead of so many passengers			0
he used a graphic to illustrate the inclination of the ship at the time @entity35 apparently lost his balance and fell into the lifeboat that took him to shore			1
he said that once on shore , @entity35 was able to conduct the rescue operation and that he never lost control of the operation			2
the attorney addressed the famous exchange between @entity165 -- commander of the @entity167 the night of the accident -- and @entity35 , during which @entity165 told @entity35 to " get back on board for f * * k 's sake			2
" @entity86 called @entity165 's tone degrading and said the commander was unprofessional and egotistic at a moment when he should have been a voice of calm			0
@entity86 suggested it was @entity165 's stern manner , rather than @entity35 's alleged ineptitude , that damaged @entity2 's reputation			0
addressing the manslaughter charges , @entity86 tried to bolster his argument that because no one died on impact when the ship slammed into the rocks , @entity35 can not be held liable			1
everyone who perished lost their lives as a result of the chaotic evacuation , he said			0
@entity86 defended @entity35 's decision to delay the call to abandon ship by nearly an hour			1
" stop for a minute to consider what would have happened if he had abandoned ship 1 kilometer from shore , " @entity86 said			0
" there could be 4,500 dead , not 32			0
" ( there were 4,229 passengers and crew on the ship			0
) he also suggested that finding @entity35 not guilty would actually be good for @entity2 's image , somehow restoring it in the eyes of the world , which has seen this case as an example of @entity11 ineptitude			1
but unless there 's a successful appeal , @entity2 will never find out if that would be the case .			0
