@entity2 @entity1 authorities knew alarming details about two of the terrorists in the @entity2 attack as recently as a year ago , according to court documents obtained by @entity3			1

" police also found computers with security and encryption and recipes for poison purportedly capable of killing a million people			0
@entity11 , accused of killing 12 people after attacking the @entity44 magazine last week with his brother , was implicated in the prison plot , but he denied involvement and was not jailed for that			1
@entity11 and @entity10 had a mentor in common , a radical named @entity49			1
once known as @entity52 's premiere @entity51 recruiter , @entity49 was convicted of conspiring to attack the @entity53 in @entity2			1
@entity11 had met @entity49 in prison , and once they were freed , he would visit him with @entity10 , bringing @entity57 food and money -- and sometimes spending days at his apartment			1
also part of the visits was @entity10 's partner , @entity62 , who 's now on the run and wanted by police			1
court documents detail how @entity11 and @entity10 plotted together , hiding their conversations by using code names over disposable cell phones			1
but what about @entity49 ? does he have any direct connection to last week 's attacks ? and what happened to him ? @entity49 was first arrested in @entity73 in 2001 for his role in the embassy plot			2
he was in custody until his trial and conviction in 2005 , then released on house arrest in 2009			0
after @entity49 's release , @entity1 authorities collected more than 45,000 pages of wire transcripts and surveillance images of him , including when he was under house arrest			2
the images include a 2010 photo of @entity49 with @entity11 and two other men , in a park			1
and a second photo , also taken in 2010 , is of @entity57 with @entity10 , who visited the recruiter in @entity92 , @entity1 , with @entity62			1
a @entity94 intelligence source verified the authenticity of the images obtained by @entity3			0
@entity49 's time out of prison did n't last long			2
in 2010 , he was arrested and charged with involvement in same prison - break plot that landed @entity10 in prison			1
he was sentenced to 12 years in prison and remains behind bars			0
@entity49 's ties to @entity52 stretch back before the 9/11 attacks in the @entity107 against the @entity108 and the @entity109 , the source said			1
in november 2000 , @entity49 traveled to @entity110 for eight months , also visiting @entity111			0
according to court records , he was put in charge of the plot to blow up the @entity53 in @entity2 -- an attack eerily similar to the 1998 attacks against @entity107 @entity53 in @entity117 and @entity118			2
the @entity94 intelligence source says @entity49 was given instructions to go to @entity73 and then @entity120 , where he would lose his old passport and get a new one			0
he was then instructed to travel to @entity123 where he would be given the equivalent of $ 60,000 to carry out the @entity2 attack on the @entity107 embassy			0
but @entity127 was stopped and questioned as he passed through @entity73			0
according to the @entity94 intelligence source , he confessed during interrogation to the planned attack on the embassy			0
he was ultimately convicted in a @entity1 court			0
@entity107 authorities never brought charges against the @entity1 - @entity133 as they did other @entity52 operatives involved in 1998 attacks on @entity107 @entity53 in @entity136			2
@entity49 's mentor was @entity139 mosque cleric @entity138 , convicted just last week on terrorism charges and sentenced to life by a federal judge in @entity143			2
