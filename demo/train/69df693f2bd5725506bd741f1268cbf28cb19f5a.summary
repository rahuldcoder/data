the first scene from the advertisement shows the woman watching television with the boy lying across her lap. she strokes him like a pet and feeds him popcorn with her fingers			2
it then portrays the boy bringing her a newspaper as she eats breakfast in bed			2
she rewards him with a morsel of food			0
icing a cake , she lets him lick her fingers and later passes him crumbs as she eats the cake			0
finally the advertisement switches to a dining room where the woman is eating dinner , the young boy crouched on the floor below her , looking up			2
she passes him small portions of food in her fingers -- feeding him like a dog			2
the commercial then switches to a text message reading : " the average domestic dog eats better than millions of children , " before asking for donations to feed a child			1
on its website , feed a child says one in 10 children in @entity1 suffers from malnutrition and dies within the first 12 months of life			1
the advert sparked a range of reaction on social media , some complained , including @ @entity68 who tweeted : " definitely the wrong way to get a message across			0
who approves these ads ? hugely racist			0
what do you think ? feed a child # feedachild , " while @ @entity76 wrote : " that advert was in such poor taste			1
do n't think there 's a way to go around it			0
what were trying to achieve ? just wow			0
# @entity82 meanwhile @ @entity83 wrote : " people outraged about the @entity82 ad as expected but is it not reality ? use that energy to feed a child not lodge complaints , " @entity8 said it had received 12 complaints about the advertisement since monday			1
" the complainants submitted that the commercial is offensive , racist and tasteless			0
it suggests that white people treat and feed black kids like dogs , which is exceptionally degrading and dehumanizing , " it said			1
" the second complainant argued that the comparison between dog owners and starving children is unfounded and irrelevant			0
every dog owner carries the responsibility to feed and care for their dog , just like the state and / or a parent carries the responsibility to care for their children			1
it is not the responsibility of dog owners to feed other people 's children			1
suggesting that white people are happy to feed their dogs expensive food , but not to help starving black children is offensive			1

feed a child 's online statement offers an " unreserved apology " to anyone offended or hurt by the commercial			2
" we acknowledge the fact that the advert could be seen as insensitive or distasteful and we take heed to the fact that many perceived the advert as racist			0
this was most certainly not the intention , and again we apologize , " feed a child said			0
in a statement released earlier , feed a child had said : " the commercial is intentionally emotive to trigger the necessary awareness on this issue to generate engagement and contributions			0
" advertising company @entity170 , who created the advertisement , also issued an apology , saying it was aware of the " negative reaction " it sparked and that it had not intended to cause offense .			2
