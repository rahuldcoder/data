@entity1 @entity0 was elected to a third term as @entity4 on tuesday after a tense floor vote that saw a remarkably large chunk of his own party attempt to remove him			1
opposition to @entity0 doubled from the last election for speaker in 2013 , when a dozen @entity11 voted against him			1
he ultimately received 216 votes , enough to fend off an embarrassing vote on a second ballot but plenty to reinforce the notion that @entity0 is struggling to maintain control over restive @entity20 republicans			1
the dramatic scene played out before live television cameras , as members were called upon one - by - one to stand and name who they were backing to serve as the next speaker			0
despite the opposition facing him , @entity0 was greeted by a standing ovation after he was nominated by rep. @entity29 on tuesday and his wife , @entity30 , watched the floor action from the speaker 's box			1
shortly after winning his spot tuesday afternoon , an emotional @entity0 called improving the economy and creating more opportunities for the middle class " our vital task			2
" " we 'll begin on common ground , " @entity0 said , adding later " all i ask is that we disagree without being disagreeable			2
" he joked that his door is always open , but " do n't get carried away with it			0
" behind the scenes , republicans who opposed @entity0 are beginning to face the fallout			1
@entity47 , who voted against @entity0 , and @entity48 , who challenged him , were removed from the @entity49 on tuesday , according to multiple sources			2
@entity49 chairman @entity51 suggested the decision to remove the two @entity11 members came from @entity0 , telling reporters he had only spoken with @entity48			1
" the committee works at the behest of the speaker and the speaker -- i believe any speaker -- would want and need a person focused on that agenda , " @entity51 said			0
@entity51 said he was surprised these members broke with @entity0 , adding " sometimes there are casualties and there are changes , and people make decisions to do things knowing sometimes there can be consequences			2
" but the @entity72 @entity11 appeared irked at the pressure from the grassroots activists these @entity0 opponents drummed up before the vote			1
" the onslaught that has happened over the last two or three days has taken a number of members by storm			0
their district offices , their @entity82 offices have been inundated by people who seemingly drew conclusions that we did n't even have time to go home and defend , " @entity51 said			0
a senior @entity20 @entity11 leadership aide indicated other members could also face some type of repercussions for their public rebuke of @entity0			1
rep. @entity95 of @entity96 said he and other republicans who voted against @entity0 fear some type of retribution			2
he said he was told by a committee chair recently that he was in line for a subcommittee chair post but then after he publicly announced his new post it was revoked , and he suggested his criticism of the leadership cost him the job			0
@entity109 rep. @entity108 , who was nominated by a @entity11 colleague to replace @entity0 and voted for himself , struck a more conciliatory note			1
he told reporters @entity0 is " the speaker of the @entity20 and i look forward to following his lead			1
" @entity0 begins the 114th @entity115 with a new @entity11 controlled @entity116 and big plans to enact a conservative agenda			1
president @entity119 will meet with congressional leadership next week			0
but the contentious election just to secure @entity0 's job is a sign that the same dynamic he 's seen in the last four years -- resistance from conservatives -- will continue to hamper his ability to govern the @entity20			1
after the vote , one of the @entity11 who voted against @entity0 , @entity95 said the vote re-electing @entity0 " sends a clear message that that @entity20 @entity11 majority is status quo -- more of the same			1
" he said the 25 members who voted for someone else or declined to vote was less about @entity0 personally , but about his leadership 's record of bringing major legislation to the @entity20 without enough input from members			1
sessions , a @entity0 ally who will help set floor debate parameters , said " that 's not the plan " and insisted there would be open deliberations with members about what bills go to the floor			2
@entity152 @entity11 rep. @entity11 , a defender of @entity0 's , said that because of the larger @entity11 majority in the @entity20 , the speaker can afford to lose some members			1
and he suggested those who broke with @entity0 are likely to continue resisting his legislative strategy going forward			2
but he warned those who regularly rebel may end up hurting their own cause			0
" there 's always a little bit of fragmentation that occurs because again , people know they can go their own way and you can still get the legislation passed			0
and i think you saw a certain amount of that today			0
' well the speaker 's going to win anyway , and this will help me at home with my right wing			0
the problem is , if that 's your reasoning , you 're going to be subjected to that every single time , and you 're going to start to lose influence , " @entity11 said			2
the speaker began reaching out to members the day after the midterm elections , and he and his allies continued to make calls and appeals for support right up until the vote on tuesday afternoon , according to a senior @entity20 @entity11 leadership aide			1
as the top fundraiser for his party he raised over $ 100 million for @entity11 members and candidates and traveled to more than 150 events over the 2014 midterm cycle			2
one of the @entity11 members who broke with @entity0 , @entity195 rep @entity194 , argued the current political system helps keep leaders like @entity0 in place because they help colleagues with campaign donations			1
" this place , it 's all about money			0
both parties , everything is about raising money for the next election			0
that 's what complicates good policy -- is the next election and raising money , " @entity194 said			0
sessions said the new @entity11 majority on @entity82 has to have a better pr effort to ensure the public gives it credit -- both with its own members and the public -- for what it is doing to cut spending			0
" we 've got to do a very good job and sell what we do and if we sell what we do , then people will see it and i believe come to our side , including our friends in the tea party who very very much want to see our party win the presidency , " @entity51 said			0
freshman @entity235 rep @entity235 , who backed @entity0 , told @entity2 it was time for the @entity20 @entity11 members to move on and start focusing on coordinating with the new @entity11 controlled @entity116			1
" it 's important this this entire @entity11 conference regardless of whether you are leadership or rank and file , whether you are conservative or moderate , or whether you are from @entity244 or from @entity152 that we work together to move @entity247 forward			0
" the no. 2 @entity20 @entity248 , rep. @entity249 of @entity250 , told @entity2 he did n't think there would be any real fallout for @entity0 of the high - profile spat on the @entity20 floor			1
" he won , " @entity249 said			0
" in two weeks no one will remember what the vote was			0
" @entity2 's @entity258 contributed to this report .			0
