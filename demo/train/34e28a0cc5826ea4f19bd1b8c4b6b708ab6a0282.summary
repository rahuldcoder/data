@entity0 -- the parents of @entity3 , an @entity4 convicted of murdering her @entity6 roommate in 2007 , were indicted tuesday for allegedly libeling police in @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity11 's mother and the family 's @entity9 attorney said			1
in a 2009 interview in the @entity15 of @entity16 , @entity11 and @entity17 said that their daughter " had not been given an interpreter , had not received food and water and had been physically and verbally abused " by police after her arrest for the murder of @entity6 exchange student @entity25 , according to @entity9 's @entity28 news agency			1
they also said police struck her and told her " things will get worse for you " if she requested an attorney			2
" yes , i am going to trial for libel ... along with one of my lawyers and a group of journalists , " @entity17 told @entity1 tuesday			1
" we are very upset by this decision , " said @entity42 , @entity3 's attorney who represents her family in this case			1
" we worked towards a dismissal because there was no intent " on the part of @entity11 's parents to libel the police , he said			1
the indictment says their claims were " contrary to the truth , " according to @entity28			2
a hearing in the case is set for july 4 , @entity42 said			1
" these are old charges , " said @entity59 , spokesman for the family			2
" they 've been around since 2009			2
" the story in question was published in 2008 , he said , and @entity11 's parents were repeating what their daughter had told them			1
the indictment , @entity67 said , finalizes the charges the prosecutor had filed and is " nothing surprising			0
" @entity11 's parents ' focus is not on their case , he said , but on her appeal of her conviction , which is under way			1
there is a break in the proceedings for experts to retest forensic evidence , he said			0
" this is , i guess you 'd call it , a bit of a minor distraction , " @entity59 said			0
@entity11 , 23 , was sentenced in december to 26 years in prison for @entity92 's death at the villa the two shared in @entity8 , the central @entity9 town where both were students			1
@entity92 , 21 , was found dead in november 2007 , semi-naked with her throat slashed			0
@entity11 and her former @entity9 boyfriend , @entity97 , were both found guilty of the murder			2
@entity97 is serving a 25 - year sentence			0
a third person , @entity25 , a drifter originally from the @entity102 , was tried separately and is serving a 16 - year prison sentence			0
the forensic experts retesting evidence as part of @entity11 's appeal must conclude their analysis by may 9 and their results are to be presented on may 21 to a jury composed of two judges and six citizens			1
evidence being retested includes a knife found in @entity97 's apartment with @entity11 's dna on the handle and what @entity8 prosecutors say is @entity92 's dna in a tiny groove on the blade			1
the prosecution contends that the knife was used to stab @entity92 in the neck and that it had been cleaned			0
the dna matter attributed to @entity92 consists of flesh , not blood , they say			0
the sample , however , was so small that forensic scientists investigating @entity92 's murder were not able to double test it in accordance with international forensic science norms , which @entity11 's legal team says raises doubts about its validity			1
the second piece of evidence the forensic experts will test is the tiny metal clasp from @entity92 's bra , which was cut from her body after her slaying			2
forensic scientists in the investigatory phase determined that @entity97 's dna is present on the metal clasp			0
the clasp was identified on an investigatory video on november 2 , 2007 , when @entity92 's body was found			0
but the clasp was not collected until nearly six weeks later , giving the defense cause to question whether the sample may have been contaminated			0
the court is not expected to make a final ruling on the appeal until next summer			0
