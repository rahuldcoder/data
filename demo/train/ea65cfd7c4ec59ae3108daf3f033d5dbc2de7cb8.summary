-- more than 30 years ago , 6 - year - old @entity1 vanished from a @entity3 street on his way to a school bus stop			1
his parents never saw him again			0
it also changed the country			0
@entity12 investigation a 33 - year - long roller - coaster ride " it awakened @entity17 , " @entity14 , president and chief executive officer of the @entity16 , recently told @entity0			2
" it was the beginning of a missing children 's movement			1
" thursday , @entity21 , a former @entity3 stock clerk who once lived in the same neighborhood as @entity23 , was arrested in connection with his death			1
the @entity12 case was the first of several high - profile cases that catapulted concern about missing children to the forefront of national consciousness			1
basement search for @entity1 clues ends just weeks after @entity23 disappeared in may 1979 , an attacker abducted the first of more than 20 children to be kidnapped and killed in @entity38 , stirring fear until police arrested a suspect two years later			1
in another case that made headlines , in 1981 someone abducted 6 - year - old @entity44 from a @entity46 shopping mall and killed him			2
the cases received increasing news coverage in a fast - changing landscape that saw a proliferation of media outlets with growing interest in compelling visual images -- such as a heart - rending photo of a smiling child or video of parents pleading for their child 's safe return			1
overheard on @entity0 : face on milk carton chipped away at our innocence the actual number of children who were kidnapped and killed did not change -- it 's always been a relatively small number -- but awareness of the cases skyrocketed , experts said in recent interviews that shed light on the issue of missing children			1
" interest in the situation exploded , " said @entity76 , whose 12 - year - old daughter , @entity77 , was kidnapped and strangled to death in a 1993 case that also received intense news coverage			1
" it really pulled the lid off of @entity17 's dirty little secret , the fact that children are being victimized in large numbers , " he told @entity0 in april			2
the cases also stoked fear , sparked awareness and prompted change from politicians and police			2
in 1984 , @entity94 passed the @entity95			0
that led to the creation of the @entity16			0
president @entity98 opened the center in a @entity101 ceremony in 1984			0
it soon began operating a 24 - hour toll - free hotline on which callers could report information about missing boys and girls			2
police officers also started to respond more quickly to reports of missing children , experts said			1
after @entity23 disappeared , investigators tried what was then a novel technique to try to find him : they put his face on thousands of milk cartons , a technique that would become more common in the next few years			1
relatives and authorities also put the images of missing children on billboards and fliers distributed by mail			1
those more assertive efforts eventually led to the @entity127 alert system , which broadcasts news about missing children on tv , radio , the @entity132 , mobile phones , lottery tickets and highway signs			1
that system has helped save 554 children , the federal government says			2
most of them were recovered after the first - ever @entity141 in 2002			0
before the dramatic increase in awareness of crimes against children in the 1980s , only a few high - profile cases grabbed the public 's attention			1
@entity76 points out that in 1873 , after a 4 - year - old @entity151 boy named @entity152 disappeared , authorities produced the first missing - child flier			2
the 1932 disappearance and killing of @entity156 , the 20 - month - old son of the world - famous aviator , attracted worldwide attention			0
it resulted in the @entity161 , which permitted federal authorities to chase kidnappers across state lines			0
even before the @entity1 case , groups were working in the 1970s -- largely out of the spotlight -- on the issue of missing children			1
they advocated tougher rules in cases of children who were abducted by relatives , said @entity174 , a professor of sociology and criminal justice at the @entity177			2
children abducted by relatives , runaways , and abductions by strangers are the three classifications of what came to be repackaged and rebranded by activists as " missing children " in the late 1970s and early 1980s , he said			1
" the missing children 's movement was the outgrowth of an earlier child - snatching movement , " @entity174 said			1
runaways comprise the largest number of the missing children , he said , and while there are few abductions by strangers , those " emotional , wrenching stories " make an impact			1
@entity174 spoke last month , after police dug up parts of a basement in an unsuccessful attempt to crack the case			2
so did @entity204 , author of " after @entity23 : the @entity205 that held @entity206			2
" she said the @entity1 case galvanized media - saturated @entity209			1
so did his photo , which @entity204 called a " beautiful " shot made by his photographer father , @entity213			0
" a picture is worth a thousand words , " she said			0
@entity204 said people empathized with the angst of @entity213 and his wife @entity218 -- seen by tv viewers and newspapers readers as normal , intelligent and wise people			0
the case never ended , the story was never over , and the news outlets never stopped covering it			0
" it started a ball rolling , " she said			0
" there was a real momentum			0
" @entity231 , associate professor of @entity233 's @entity232 , has said such " heinous crimes are always newsworthy " and " have been reported in the press for as long as there has been a press			0
" " as media became more plentiful and visual in the 1980s , child abductions and child murders allowed for the kinds of images that are at once intimate and universal -- like school photos and grieving families , " @entity238 said			0
" the use of milk cartons as another form of media to locate missing children was a way to bring the issue into the family space -- the breakfast table -- heightening awareness as well as anxieties			1
" @entity23 's family and @entity44 's parents have been particularly media savvy , she said , as they kept their cases front and center before the public and law enforcement			1
" they were strategically and actively engaged in cultivating their attention			0
and in the age of the 24 - hour news cycle , there were more reporters looking for substantive news stories and more space to fill , " she said			0
the case raised consciousness but also stirred fear			0
" i think it ended an era of innocence in this country , " @entity14 said			0
" parents around the nation saw how it happened and thought , ' but for the grace of @entity286 , my child			0

new : @entity209 police say a man has been arrested in the death of @entity1
the case was the first of several high - profile missing children cases
@entity23 's photo was posted on milk cartons , a new idea at the time
abductions by strangers are rare ; runaways are much more numerous
