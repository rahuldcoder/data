-- there is no shortage of amazing industrial commercial applications for 3 - d printing -- internal organs , stem cells , artificial limbs , art , cars , customizable furniture			1
but if you had a 3 - d printer sitting on your desk at home , what would you make ? some people know immediately : they 'd create physical @entity18 models , make manga figurines , pop out replacement parts for a motorcycle			1
but most people will likely see a @entity24 printer , think it 's cool , then have no idea what to do next and move on			2
that could change , though , as dirt - cheap 3 - d printers like the @entity30 or new @entity31 simplify the technology and put it in more people 's hands and home offices			1
" the market for desktop @entity24 printers right now is really makers , professional users and people who have a lot of patience and time , " said @entity36 , the entrepreneur behind the $ 200 @entity38 printer			1
the @entity31 attempts to simplify 3 - d printing for a more consumer - friendly experience , by lowering the price and reducing the complexity of assembling the devices and minting objects			1
amateurs , basement inventors and hobbyists with no experience printing in three dimensions can jump right in and start experimenting with minimal investment			2
there are trade - offs , of course			0
the $ 200 version uses only the less expensive @entity65 plastic , which can melt at a lower temperature than other materials			1
a $ 300 version of the printer is available that can work with more substances			0
the final products will be a step down from what you could make with more professional machines			0
" we 're not optimizing on quality because we think there 's actually room for ' good enough , ' " said @entity36			2
the idea for @entity31 grew out of the @entity83 crowdfunding site			2
the project 's goal was to connect the dots between product prototypes , crowdfunding , and the eventual manufacturing process			0
say a product designer comes up with an idea for a pedometer armband			0
he could raise money from interested mall - walkers , then be guided through the product manufacturing process			0
@entity36 has unique experience in all three areas			0
based in @entity98 , he studied mechanical engineering at @entity100 and has worked as a toy designer			0
in 2005 , he struck out on his own , crowdfunding a product before starting a co-working space in @entity104 called @entity105			0
he launched @entity106 in 2011			0
to get the ball rolling and generate interest in the site , @entity107 posted a seed project the team had been working on internally : a cheap and fast 3 - d printer			1
posted in january 2012 , the @entity31 kit was priced at $ 350 and aimed at entry - level consumers who did n't want to drop thousands of dollars on a higher - end desktop @entity24 printer like the @entity118 ( $ 2,000 )			1
it quickly raised $ 100,000 , and the team pushed aside the crowdsourcing idea to work full time on the @entity24 printer			0
now a staff of six full - time employees is perfecting and shipping beta versions of the @entity126 for $ 200 , feeling out the nascent market for cheap @entity38 printers			1
@entity36 thinks that if the technology becomes more accessible , creative people will come up with broader applications we have n't thought of yet , and desktop @entity24 printer sales could take off			2
or the 3 - d printer could go the way of the home photo printer			1
when personal photo printers first debuted , there was a spike in sales , but slowly the demand dropped			0
people were n't printing out as many photos , and if they did it was generally cheaper and easier to have them done by one of the photo services with higher - end printers , such as @entity149 or @entity150			1
@entity151 has already announced plans to offer 3 - d printing services in some stores			1
" i 'm not really sure there is an established market for this or that people do know what they 're going to use it for , " said @entity36			2
" it 's a @entity162 market right now ; we do n't really know where it 's going to end up			2
" over the next six months , @entity36 plans to contine rolling out the @entity166 while also returning to the idea of connecting engineers , inventors and product developers to the sometimes confusing world of manufacturing			0
he 's already seeing a surge in everyday devices that connect to the @entity175 and is working with local entrepreneurs in @entity98			0
" what we 're looking at doing is developing tech that bridges that gap between traditional manufacturing and 3 - d printing , " @entity36 said			1
part - time inventors experimenting on cheap 3 - d printers might be the next wave of people seeking out his help .			1

new desktop 3 - d printers are dropping in price and getting easier to use
makers of the $ 200 @entity31 think there 's a market for " good enough " printers
if more people get their hands on 3 - d printing , interesting new uses could pop up
