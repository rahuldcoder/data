@entity0 -- as more than one pundit has noted , president @entity2 now has three choices in @entity5 : bad , worse , and horrible			1
at least the evidence is steadily stacking up to suggest that is the case			2
last year , @entity2 made it clear that the @entity9 would take action if @entity5 crossed " a red line " by using chemical weapons in its civil war			1
and there 's evidence that it has			1
what 's not clear is what kind of action the @entity9 will or should take			1
some of the players in that troubled country 's civil war are more unsavory than others , but there appears to be no clear or reliable " good side " behind which the president might deploy @entity9 military might at this moment			1
indeed , military , political , and diplomatic analysts widely agree that every potentially positive move on the table is freighted with negative side effects			0
" i think there are no good options in @entity5 , " says retired @entity36 gen. @entity34 , a @entity1 contributor			1
" there is an array of bad options and you have to take the least bad option that is out there			0
" so let 's break down those options , including some that have already come and gone in this tortured march toward a possible military engagement : option 1 : ground troops the @entity52 called this a non-starter from the get go			1
you do n't have to be a political scientist to know that @entity9 voters are exhausted by more than a decade of war in @entity60 and @entity61 , and would show little or no tolerance for more boots on the ground in the @entity65			1
furl the flag , lieutenant ; no one is going anywhere tonight			0
what do @entity5 's neighbors think ? option 2 : establishing a no - fly zone yes , it might work , but the administration has shown little taste for that , either			1
maintaining such a presence over the months it might take to have an impact would be hideously expensive , and would involve endangering @entity9 pilots with highly uncertain results in a battle that many @entity9 find confusing at best , baffling at worst			2
option 3 : arming the rebels this is a monkey trap in which the @entity9 has been snared before			2
some brave rebel group proclaiming its love of freedom and democracy arises to oppose a distant tyrant			0
@entity9 rewards the rhetoric with training , missiles and munitions			2
the coup is accomplished and suddenly , to paraphrase @entity94 , the oppressed start looking a lot like the oppressors and they no longer return your phone calls			0
in @entity5 it is even more complicated			2
as the civil war has droned on against president @entity105 , interlopers affiliated with terrorist groups have become big - leaguers			1
" @entity111 's affiliate in @entity5 , @entity109 , is generally acknowledged to be the most effective force fighting , " says @entity1 national security analyst @entity107 who adds , " @entity109 's military prowess and close ties to @entity111 make it a potentially serious threat to @entity9 interests in the region			1
" @entity116 : @entity5 is a problem from hell for the @entity9 @entity5 watchers roundly agree that no other rebel group is currently positioned to take control of the country			1
in other words , if the @entity9 pushes too hard or too fast to overthrow @entity105 ( even though in the long run , @entity9 officials do want him gone ) the @entity9 risks helping terror groups take power			2
and you know what they say about the devil you know ... option 4 : securing @entity134 ' support not going to happen without some other major developments in @entity5			2
@entity136 and @entity137 have left no doubt that they will oppose any effort at the @entity134 to approve a strike , and other countries have hardly shown much appetite for the subject			0
why @entity136 , @entity137 , and @entity145 are standing by @entity5 president @entity2 calls it an " incapacity " on the part of the @entity134 , but there is no sign that the name - calling will change anything			1
does the public care about @entity134 support ? option 5 : assembling a coalition without the @entity134 a week ago , newscasts were buzzing with speculation about a nascent coalition , perhaps born of @entity160 allies -- a daring group of nations ready to stand with the @entity9 as it punished @entity105			2
secretary of state @entity163 is ballyhooing support from the @entity165 , @entity166 , and @entity167 , saying " we are not alone in our will to do something			0
" one by one , however , names have slipped off of the list from this support group			0
and with the @entity175 @entity174 now having rejected the idea of @entity175 's military getting involved , @entity2 is looking more and more like the lone commander charging the hill while his allies hunker down in the trenches			1
option 6 : firing missiles from warships in the @entity184 yes , it is pretty much down to that now , and even that option is complicated			0
make no mistake : @entity190 missiles are magnificent , virtually unstoppable weapons capable of pinpoint , devastating strikes			0
however , all the days of wrangling have given the @entity5 an immense amount of time to hide their own weapons , secure their airplanes , and disperse critical command and control assets			1
should the @entity200 start flying , they may well find themselves crashing down into an inordinate number of empty buildings , according to gen. @entity203 -- or worse , into places packed with civilians			0
what 's more , @entity5 's allies such as @entity145 could respond to what would undoubtedly be called an act of war by stepping up aid to @entity105 , and he could emerge with a stronger military as a result			1
at home the situation is not much better			0
the @entity52 has blitzed the airwaves and the internet with official statements			0
defense secretary @entity220 has declared the military ready to go			0
secretary @entity163 has described the lurid pictures of chemical attack victims , saying " all of them show and report victims with breathing difficulties , people twitching with spasms , coughing , rapid heartbeats , foaming at the mouth , unconsciousness , and death ... " president @entity2 himself sat down with @entity234 to explain the broader , regional implications of allowing @entity5 to use chemical weapons with impunity			1
" this is a volatile country in a very volatile region			0
we 've got allies bordering @entity5			2
@entity166 is a @entity160 ally , @entity242 a close friend that we work with a lot			0
@entity245 is very close by			0
we 've got bases throughout the region			0
we can not see a breach of the nonproliferation norm that allows , potentially , chemical weapons to fall into the hands of all kinds of folks			1
" but none of it seems to have mattered much			0
the president faces stiff opposition in @entity258			0
democrats , like rep. @entity259 of @entity260 , are saying that @entity9 " can not be the lone sheriff of the whole world			2
the @entity9 must be careful in how it proceeds and must act together with a coalition of countries			1
" republicans , like sen. @entity267 of @entity268 , seem disturbed by the administration 's lack of clarity on the mission and timetable			0
" the administration informed us that they have a ' broad range of options ' for @entity5 , " he says , " but failed to layout a single option			1
" as for the public , an @entity281 poll has found only half of @entity9 support any kind of military action against @entity5 , and 80 % say it should happen only with congressional approval			1
so we 're back to where we started : the choices are dreadful and would be for any president , @entity290 or @entity291 ; the outcomes are wildly uncertain ; and the consequences -- no matter which direction he turns -- are likely to be grave			0
against this backdrop of unspeakable acts and unfathomable causes and effects , perhaps it is small wonder that @entity2 keeps saying , " i have not made a final decision			2
" although in the very act of doing that , he is committing to one choice not mentioned so far : waiting			0
waiting to see if some new evidence , some new ally , some new intelligence clears the smoke over @entity5 and makes plain a way forward .			1

analysts say there are no good options for the @entity9 in @entity5
the @entity9 has laid out evidence that @entity5 has used chemical weapons
@entity2 vowed to act if @entity5 crossed that ' red line '
@entity5 's civil war began in 2011
