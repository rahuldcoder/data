@entity0 -- baby formula , pigs , soybeans , oil and iron ore -- a seemingly disparate grouping -- have one thing in common			1
these commodities are all in high demand from an insatiable and growing @entity11			1
personal choice drives some of this demand			0
@entity11 national interest fuels demand for others			1
for example , since 2008 , when hundreds of thousands of babies fell ill from tainted milk formula , @entity11 mainlanders began to travel the world looking for milk powder sources perceived as more trustworthy			1
a growing middle class , with the money to travel , are @entity11 's new global consumers looking for quality beyond borders			1
at the same time , because of @entity11 's lack of certain key resources needed to feed its people and fuel its economy -- the second largest in the world -- @entity32 has moved to secure oil , iron ore and crops halfway around the world			1
regardless , whether by choice or by force , @entity11 and its citizens are looking to new markets and buying what they need			2
it is a sign of things to come , say analysts			0
soybeans : stuff of oil , tofu and animal feed " on a per capita basis , @entity11 has half the arable land and a third to a quarter of the water than the global average , " says @entity50 of the @entity51 in @entity52			1
" as they 've gone through phenomenal growth , their food security has diminished marvelously			0
the question is who is going to feed @entity11			2
" @entity11 is the world 's largest importer of soybeans			1
the grain is one of the key starting links in the country 's food chain , used to make cooking oil , tofu products and in feed for the burgeoning pig industry			1
in 2012 , the world 's most populous country imported 59 % of the world 's soybean supply , according to @entity51 data , up from about 25 % in 2000			0
" if they had to produce their own soybeans , they would need to use 28 million hectares , " says @entity50			0
that would mean nearly one - quarter -- about 23 % -- of @entity11 's total arable land would be used for soybeans , based on @entity11 's latest data from 2008			2
just 12 % of @entity11 's total area was arable in 2011 , according to the @entity89 , compared to 17.5 % in the @entity90 and 34 % in @entity91			2
" they decided they could not do that ( use so much arable land for soybeans ) -- so they import , " added @entity50			0
@entity11 relies on three main exporters for its soybean supply -- all in the @entity100 : @entity101 , the @entity90 and @entity102 which account for nearly half -- 46 % -- of the supply of global exports			2
pork : ' 470 million pigs in @entity11 ' besides soybeans , @entity11 is the world 's biggest consumer of pork products eating " more pig products than the rest of the world combined , " says @entity50			1
" existing estimates have @entity11 at 48 % of global consumption			0
" while @entity11 is estimated to have raised 470 million pigs in 2012 , a number that increased about 1.5 % each year over the last decade according to @entity51 , that has not been enough to keep up with demand			0
@entity11 is a net importer of pork products -- from the @entity90 , @entity123 and @entity124 in particular			1
" there is lots of concern , " added @entity50			0
" as an analyst it 's been on almost everyone 's mind for the last 30 years			0
" that concern extends from food to natural resources and @entity11 's search for supplies around the world			1
oil acquisitions and agreements in july 2012 , @entity11 oil producer , @entity140 , paid $ 15 billion to acquire @entity141 , one of @entity124 's largest independent oil companies which owns assets in the @entity145 , in the @entity146 off the coast of @entity148 and off the coast of @entity150			2
in november 2012 , @entity11 's @entity152 and @entity153 's @entity151 signed an agreement that would send 1.4 million barrels a day to the @entity156 nation			0
but one @entity11 economics watcher says the world " should n't be too worried " and that demand for food -- and for natural resources from oil to iron ore -- may eventually see decreased demand			1
" @entity11 is the world 's factory but those factories used to be in other cheaper countries			0
they got relocated to @entity11 because it 's cheaper to manufacture , " says professor @entity168 , associate dean of business and economics at the @entity170			0
" so on paper , you see increasing demand from @entity11 for natural resources , but this is displacing demand from other countries -- from @entity179 and @entity180 to @entity11			2
" production costs for foreign multinationals will rise in @entity11 , adds @entity168 , " so a few years down the road we may ask the same questions about @entity185 and @entity186			0

more *affluent* @entity11 able to travel beyond borders for quality food products
@entity32 searching for natural resource supplies to *protect* national interests
soybeans , pork , oil , iron ore are commodities that may be *impacted* , say analysts
