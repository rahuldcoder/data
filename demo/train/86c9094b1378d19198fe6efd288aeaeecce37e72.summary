@entity0 -- a new political ad against @entity4 @entity3 could easily have been an attack ad against @entity6 in 2012			1
one of the toughest spots to hit @entity3 this cycle , the 30 - second ad paints the former senator from @entity11 as a " yes man " to a large corporation that has outsourced jobs			0

@entity3 was ousted from @entity27 in 2012 , but he 's now fighting to reclaim a spot in the @entity21 , this time from @entity29 where he 's challenging incumbent @entity18 sen. @entity30			1
a $ 500,000 ad buy , the spot starts airing tuesday on cable and broadcast and will run for two weeks			0

they point out that when she was governor of @entity29 , part of the state 's food stamp program was outsourced to @entity46			0
