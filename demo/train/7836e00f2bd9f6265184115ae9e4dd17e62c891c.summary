-- it 's one thing to find a strategy that works in the lab , but quite another to prove that it 's effective in the real world as well			2
a decade ago , researchers at the @entity7 made headlines when they published the results of the @entity10 ( @entity11 )			1
the study , which was designed to compare the effects of diet and exercise against the best medications to control the chronic disease , surprisingly showed that diet and exercise were better than the best drugs scientists had developed to protect those at highest risk from developing diabetes			1
the results were encouraging and disheartening at the time , however , since lifestyle changes are notoriously the most difficult to implement			0
it 's too challenging for patients to stick with a diet and exercise program , and even if they did , their motivation typically wanes after six months			0
@entity0 : type 2 diabetes is tougher to treat in kids and teens but the findings -- the diet and exercise group lowered their risk of getting diabetes by 58 % compared to those on medications -- were too stunning to ignore			1
the @entity11 relied on intensive and highly individualized coaching to help the patients stay on their diet and fitness regimens			2
how could the strategies used in the dpp be modified to work in the real world , where personal nutritionists and trainers are n't always at our beck and call ? dr. @entity52 , an associate investigator at the @entity53 and a consulting professor at @entity55 , was eager to find out			2
as a primary care physician , she says , " we know there are huge numbers of patients out there who need this type of intervention			0
we just do n't have the manpower and resources to deliver interventions such as the one tested in the @entity11			0
that motivated me and my collaborators to find practical ways of delivering the principles of @entity11 in a more realistic manner			2
" @entity0 video : competing in the @entity75 with type 1 diabetes @entity52 joined forces with scientists at the @entity79 who had participated in the government 's @entity11 study and were already tackling that very question			1
they had developed the @entity85 , a curriculum culled from the dpp that they were testing in both group - based and home - based settings			2
the 12 - week program involved either weekly face - to - face sessions with a registered dietitian and fitness instructor in a class setting in which participants learned and discussed healthy diet and exercise techniques , or a self - motivated program based on dvds that taught participants similar healthy living techniques			0
@entity52 used the same @entity85 curriculum and dvd in her study involving 241 people with pre-diabetes , but modified what the self - motivated group received by adding online and e-mail counseling as well			1
after three months of intensive training and a year of maintenance sessions , the coach - led group lost an average of 14 pounds , while the dvd group shed 10 pounds ; the control group , which received usual care but no specific weight - loss goals , lost only five pounds			1
more than double the proportion of people using the coach - led sessions ( 37 % ) reached the @entity11 goal of losing 7 % of their starting body weight , while 36 % of those using dvds and only 14 % of those getting usual care reached that goal			1
@entity0 : heart risk for diabetics may be exaggerated the findings confirm that new strategies for helping at - risk people to control and even reverse impending symptoms may be just as effective , if not more so in some cases , than currently available treatments			0
" i would want to encourage national initiatives to consider alternative ways for lowering diabetes risk , such as the ones we tested , " says @entity52			1
" based on the evidence , face - to - face interventions seem to have the strongest effect , but there is data accumulating to support alternative delivery strategies such as through dvds or online			1
and considering the number of people at risk of diabetes and heart disease , we need to find meaningful and sustainable ways to reach these people			0
" @entity52 says she and her colleagues intentionally tested strategies such as using e-mail reminders , online counseling and self - initiated dvd sessions because they rely on already - existing resources and would not require extensive investment in infrastructure			0
while the study only followed the participants for 15 months , @entity52 says continued research on such alternative strategies may lead to methods that are even longer - lasting and inspire even stronger compliance in the future			1
" longer - term follow - up and longer - term success is something that is attracting a lot of research interest right now , " she says			0
and as the results suggest , for good reason			0

researchers aimed to make the @entity10 strategy more realistic
in the study , a group led by a fitness coach lost an average of 14 pounds
alternative strategies could be an *important* tool in the fight against diabetes
