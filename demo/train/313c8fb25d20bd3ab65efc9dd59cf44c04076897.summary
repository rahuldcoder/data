@entity11 , 52 , was convicted of biting and shooting @entity12 , 29 , in her townhouse in the @entity15 neighborhood of @entity0 in 1986			1
@entity16 , who rose through ranks of the @entity5 and became a veteran art theft detective , could be eligible for parole in 22 years			1

a jury convicted her in march of first - degree murder			0
friday 's sentence was the maximum under state law , prosecutors said			0
@entity16 was charged with staging the crime scene to look like a burglary gone bad , and police long believed that @entity38 was the victim of two male burglars			1
the 1986 case went cold for years			0
then it was reopened in 2004 and again in 2009 , when dna from a bite mark on the victim 's arm came back as a match to the detective			1
when @entity16 became a suspect , homicide detectives faced " special challenges as @entity16 ' office was located next door to the detectives who were now investigating her , " police said in a statement in march			2
@entity38 , a hospital nursing supervisor , was the new bride of @entity57 , who had been @entity16 ' college sweetheart			1
married for just three months , @entity57 found his wife 's body when he returned home from work			2
@entity38 was brutally beaten and shot three times in the chest , authorities said			2
@entity67 deputy prosecutors @entity65 and @entity68 submitted a written statement to the court prior to the sentencing , according to the prosecutor 's office			2
" @entity16 has never taken responsibility for her acts , " the prosecutors wrote			2
" @entity16 has never expressed any regret or remorse for her actions			2
@entity16 ' profound narcissism led her to kill and continues to motivate her denial of responsibility			2
this unrepentant selfishness poses a real and significant danger to any person whose interests conflict with @entity16 ' egotistic desires			2
" before the sentencing friday , @entity38 ' mother , @entity90 , told the court that her family has endured " extreme pain " over her daughter 's murder			1
" every day we miss her laughter and her love , " the mother told the judge			0
in his remarks to the judge , a tearful @entity57 said @entity38 was " just trying to save her own life " on the day of her murder			2
" i just ca n't bear thinking about these moments , " @entity57 told the court			1
after the sentencing , @entity16 , manacled and dressed in a jail jumpsuit , waved and smiled to an apparent loved one in the courtroom gallery as she was escorted back to jail , carrying a folder			2
following @entity16 ' conviction in march , @entity0 police chief @entity115 said the case was " a tragedy on every level			2
" " not only did the family of @entity12 lose a wife and a daughter , a life that can never be returned , but also the @entity5 family felt a sense of betrayal to have an officer commit such a terrible crime , " @entity115 said in a written statement			1
" i am also sorry it took us so long to solve this case and bring a measure of justice to this tragedy , " he said			0
@entity38 , director of nursing at @entity134 , was a tall , athletic 29 - year - old with a pretty smile			1
at the time of the slaying , @entity16 was in her second year with the @entity5			0
the killing occurred on february 24 , 1986 , a monday			0

during the trial , @entity57 testified he casually dated @entity16 after college , but he never considered her a girlfriend and dated other women while seeing her			0
@entity16 eventually married a @entity5 detective and the couple adopted a daughter			1
according to prosecutors , the key to unlocking @entity16 ' dark secret lay for years on the back shelf of an evidence freezer in the coroner 's office			1
in a vial inside a sealed evidence envelope was a cotton swab			0
on that swab , prosecutors say , was dna taken from saliva from the bite wound on @entity38 's left forearm			1
testing in 2005 revealed the assailant was a woman			0
some detectives , however , clung to the burglary theory and focused their inquiries on known female prowlers			0
but from the beginning , the victim 's family had pointed to an ex-girlfriend of @entity57 's who was a cop , and as the dna testing advanced , undercover police followed @entity16 to a @entity180 store and retrieved a discarded soda from a trash can			1
saliva traces from the straw matched the bite mark dna , and she officially became a suspect			0
@entity16 was confronted , and another sample was taken from her shortly before her arrest			0
tests revealed the dna found in the bite mark on @entity38 's left forearm belonged to @entity16			1
deputy assistant district attorney @entity65 told jurors during the trial that the chance of the killer being anyone else is " one in 1.7 sextillion			0
" to avoid botching an undercover investigation of one of their own , @entity5 officials carefully devised a plan to arrest @entity16			0
on june 5 , 2009 , detective @entity202 from the department 's robbery - homicide division approached @entity16 at her desk in the department 's headquarters and asked her to accompany him downstairs to the department 's jail facility , where she would not be able to bring her gun			1
he told @entity214 he needed her help interrogating a man who claimed to have information on stolen art , @entity16 ' specialty in the detectives unit			0
a nearly hour - long recorded interview followed			0
after one of the detectives alludes to the evidence that implicated her in the killing , @entity16 said , " am i on ' @entity227 ' or something ? this is insane			1
" minutes later she walked out of the interview room , only to be stopped , handcuffed and told she was under arrest in the murder of @entity38			0
@entity16 's attorney , @entity236 , has argued in court that the crime scene evidence from 1986 was mishandled and tainted years ago and could n't be trusted			1
