-- hundreds of student protesters barricaded inside @entity3 's @entity2 for the past four days say they are disappointed by the government 's failure to respond to their ultimatum friday			1
the demonstrators , mostly university students , are protesting against the ruling party 's push for a trade pact with @entity12 , which they claim will hurt the island			1
the movement has been dubbed the " @entity16 " by @entity3 media			1
the group leading the protest -- the @entity19 against the @entity20 -- announced the ultimatum on thursday , demanding that president @entity22 withdraw the controversial trade agreement and issue an apology by noon friday			1
as the deadline passed , no direct response from @entity22 was given , and student protesters appeared on @entity3 television expressing their disappointment			1
they said they would continue to occupy @entity2 and would announce their next move at a press conference to be held at 6 p.m. local time ( @entity33 6 a.m. ) friday			2
the protesters entered the main assembly hall inside the @entity36 in @entity37 on tuesday night and blocked the entrances with chairs , according to images and accounts filed from the scene with @entity43			0
police responded but had not dispersed the protesters , who also filled the streets around the @entity2 in the center of @entity37			1
by march 19 , @entity3 's state news agency reported that 38 police officers were injured when more than 400 protesters took over the @entity2			1
four protesters were arrested in two unsuccessful attempts to evict them , the news agency reported			0
police said there were more than 2,000 protesters both inside and outside the building , with a equal number of officers on the scene			0
" we do not want to clash with the police , " said protester and @entity61 , 19			0
" we just have to let the government know that never try to fool the people			0
" one @entity0 ireporter said that after the protesters took over , hundreds gathered outside the building , with some making speeches and singing songs			0
in a video , a young woman sings @entity75 's song " the times they are a-changin ' , " which many associate with the protest spirit of the 1960s			2
" she played the @entity75 song because she thinks the lyrics match the ongoing events happening in @entity3 , " said @entity80 , 24 , who shot the video			2
" @entity75 is n't really that popular in @entity3 , especially not to the 8th grade generation , what @entity3 call children born after 1991 , but to the older generations i think he is n't a stranger to them			2
" the trade pact was signed last year in @entity93 to ease investment and trade between the two longtime adversaries , mainland @entity12 and @entity3			1
but opponents have voiced concerns that not only will @entity3 's economy be hurt as businesses and investments flow to @entity12 , but the island 's democratic system could be undermined by closer ties with the mainland			1
" the trade agreement was not supervised by the people of @entity3 , and benefits only big companies and harnesses our jobs , " @entity61 wrote			1
" but i do agree we need to open @entity3 to the world , even @entity12 too			1
but not this way , not by signing an agreement that is not fair to us and was negotiated by people who have no profession in these territories			0
we must rewrite the agreement and make it work for the both of us , towards a peaceful future between the strait of @entity3			2
" an ireporter identified as @entity123 , an @entity126 - @entity125 living in @entity3 , wrote that the government 's handling of the trade agreement " was unconstitutional and a blatant violation of the people 's rights			1
... i care deeply because my parents are @entity3 and they always loved their nation like no other			2
i am personally affected because i value the rights of the people to voice and make changes in a democratic country			0
" in a statement , @entity140 urged security forces to show restraint			0
" the situation is clearly tense			0
... while police have a duty to maintain order and to protect the safety of the public , the response must only be proportionate to the threat			0
@entity152 should only be used as a last resort			0
the authorities must ensure the rights of all those protesting are upheld and respected , " said @entity154 , the group 's @entity155 research director			0
last month , @entity3 and @entity12 held their highest - level talks in more than six decades , marking the first government - to - government contact since the pair 's acrimonious split in 1949			1
@entity164 of @entity3 's @entity165 , which oversees the island 's @entity12 policy , met with his mainland counterpart , @entity168 of @entity12 's @entity169			1
after the meeting , @entity12 's state news agency @entity170 said the two sides had agreed to open a regular communication channel			1
" we should both be resolute to not let cross-strait relations suffer any more twists and turns and never let ( the relationship ) go backward , " @entity168 was quoted as saying			0
previous contact between the two sides has been conducted through semi-official foundations or through political parties , not by government ministers acting in their official capacities			0
@entity184 considers @entity3 a breakaway province and has never ruled out the use of force to achieve reunification			2
@entity3 also calls itself the @entity3			2
relations between the two sides have improved since @entity3 president @entity22 came to power in 2008			0
on wednesday , @entity22 called for the passage of the trade pact			1
@entity0 's @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196 contributed to this report .			0
