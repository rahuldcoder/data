-- a day before tuesday 's election , millions of people in key states already had cast absentee or early ballots despite long lines , legal disputes over poll procedures and damage inflicted by @entity10			1
in @entity11 , which may be the decisive battleground state , the deadline for early voting passed monday afternoon			1
by friday , more than 1.6 million of @entity11 's 7.9 million registered voters had cast ballots , either in person or by mail , said @entity18 , a spokesman for @entity11 secretary of state @entity19			1
about 200,000 of the 1.3 million absentee ballots that had been distributed were still out , he said			1
election officials are already facing a lawsuit over how provisional ballots -- issued to people whose eligibility to vote at a particular precinct was in question , or if they requested an absentee ballot but did n't return one -- should be filled out			1
opinion : @entity32 's voting system is a disgrace state law says poll workers need to note a voter 's drivers ' license number or the last four digits of a social security number on the ballot			0
but left - leaning groups say instructions @entity19 issued to election officials on friday appear to indicate that writing down those digits is the voter 's job , not the poll worker 's , and warn that could result in votes being thrown out when provisional ballots are counted november 17			1
a federal judge has set a hearing for wednesday on the issue			1
but @entity19 , a @entity54 , said on sunday that the process " is consistent with the courts and consistent with the law			0
" " we believe that this is the best way to make elections run successfully so that the most votes are counted , " he said			0
" we believe it 's consistent with the law			0
we believe it 's the right way to run elections in @entity11			1
" @entity19 had already been taken to court for trying to cut off early voting in the three days before tuesday , with @entity67 accusing him of trying to suppress the votes of @entity67 - leaning constituencies			2
@entity19 called that " an absurd notion			0
" " the rules are the same for everybody , " he said			0
" they do n't target any one group or individual			0
what we 're trying to do is to make the system run fair and smooth for everybody			0
" other eyes were on @entity82 , another vote - rich state where polls show president @entity84 and former @entity86 gov. @entity85 running neck - and - neck			2
@entity0 poll of polls there were still long lines for early voting when the deadline passed over the weekend , so election officials in the state 's most populous belt -- @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 counties -- allowed voters to pick up , fill out and submit absentee ballots			1
in @entity100 , the lines snaked around the block from the office of the county supervisor of elections ahead of a monday afternoon deadline			1
@entity109 said he cast a ballot within 20 minutes during early voting last week -- but when he came back to pick up an absentee ballot for his son , he spent more than three hours in the queue			2
it 's election time , " @entity115 told @entity0			0
" no other option -- you do what you have to do			0
" @entity120 spent more than four hours in line			2
but since she had been in a similar line four years ago , she had planned for a long wait			2
tuesday , she predicted , " is going to be worse			0
" " i am really tired , but it is worth it , " @entity120 said			1
" thank @entity126 it is n't every day			0
" @entity82 @entity54 , led by gov. @entity128 , had pushed to cut the number of days available for early voting from 14 to eight			0
@entity67 went to court to get that period extended , arguing the polling facilities in south @entity82 , a @entity67 stronghold , were n't up to the demand			0
in the @entity135 , the states hit hardest by @entity10 were trying to make accommodations for people who had been displaced by the storm or whose normal poling places had been knocked out of commission			2
in @entity142 , gov. @entity141 said monday he has signed an executive order allowing people displaced by @entity10 to go to any " approximate polling place , " sign an affidavit add cast their votes for president , @entity150 or other races that would have been on the ballot in their own precincts			1
" we want everyone to vote , " @entity141 said			0
" just because you 're displaced does n't mean you should be disenfranchised			0
" @entity158 , an election expert at @entity160 's @entity159 , said he believes @entity141 's move is allowable under state election laws			0
" this is probably not ideal , " said @entity158 , the deputy director of the @entity163 at the liberal - leaning @entity159			2
" but given the dire circumstances , people should be allowed to cast their ballots			1
" @entity158 said it would be " hard to imagine what the objection could be , " but said there is one potential downside : voters might be left with the mistaken impression that they could vote on local issues or races in another district			2
and voters in some counties may get another day to cast ballots if the disruptions prevent enough citizens from showing up , state board of elections spokesman @entity178 said sunday			1
@entity187 election officials could ask to allow another day of voting if tuesday 's turnout is less than 25 % , he said			0
the state board would consider the request and , if approved , a second day of voting would be scheduled within 20 days of tuesday , he said			0
@entity192 lets @entity10 victims vote via e-mail polls would be open for 11 hours on the second day , with only those who were eligible to vote on tuesday allowed to cast ballots			1
@entity187 elections commissioner @entity198 expects a " significant drop - off " in the turnout on @entity201 , which saw extensive flooding when the storm hit october 29			1
in @entity192 , where @entity10 made landfall , residents displaced by the storm will be allowed to vote by e-mail or fax , the first time civilians have been allowed to cast ballots remotely			1
@entity192 's announcement allows people who have been forced to leave their communities , as well as emergency workers working with disaster - relief efforts away from home , to do the same			1
" this is n't like , ' hell , i feel like staying at work tonight , let me fax my vote in			0
' no , no , no , " gov. @entity221 told reporters sunday			0
" this is if you have been displaced from your home by the storm			2
this is also not , ' i got evicted for not paying rent -- i 'd like to vote by fax. ' no. " the state is also consolidating polling places that have lost power or are cut off with others that are up and running , said @entity235 , a spokesman for @entity192 lt. governor @entity236			1
in many states , remote electronic voting is already available to members of the military and @entity32 citizens living overseas			2
but experts have raised concerns about the security of electronic voting in the past			2
@entity192 officials did not explain how they will authenticate e-mails or faxes from voters			1
but @entity221 quipped sunday that there would be " no more voter fraud in @entity192 than usual			1
" " nothing 's different because we 're giving people different modes to be able to vote , " he said			0
" i do n't think it 's any more susceptible to fraud than the system is already			0
" and anyone who tries " better hope they do n't get caught , because if they do , we 'll make an example of them			0
" the presidential race is n't expected to be close in @entity142 or @entity192 , both longtime @entity67 strongholds in national politics			1
know your polling place and offshore , the @entity271 said it would help any sailors and @entity273 aboard the helicopter carrier @entity275 who had planned to vote on tuesday get their ballots cast			1
the ship had been at sea on a training mission when @entity10 formed , and it was then dispatched to the @entity142 / @entity192 area to assist with relief efforts			1
many of the roughly 1,100 aboard were registered to vote in their hometowns rather than in the counties around the ship 's homeport of @entity288 , @entity289 , so their votes had likely been cast and mailed already			2
for those registered in @entity289 , the @entity271 is working to get them a federal write - in ballot that will be transferred back to shore , lt. commander @entity291 told @entity0			2
@entity0 's @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity303 and @entity296 contributed to this report .			0
