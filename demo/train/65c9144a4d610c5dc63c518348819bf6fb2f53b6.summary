an exasperated president @entity2 on tuesday expressed new surprise and dismay at the lack of congressional action on stemming gun violence , hours after yet another @entity1 community was jolted by a deadly school shooting			1
he said the failure to expand background checks on firearms sales was his " biggest frustration " as president , and called on concerned citizens to vent their anger loudly			2
@entity2 said it was " stunning " @entity16 could n't pass laws making it harder to obtain firearms in the aftermath of the 2012 elementary school shooting that devastated @entity21 , @entity22 , and stunned the nation			1
@entity2 said the violence on that december morning amounted to the " worst day " of his presidency			1
" why are n't we doing something about this ? " he asked during an online question - and - answer session on college costs at the @entity28			2
" i will tell you , i have been in @entity33 for a while now			0
most things do n't surprise me			0
the fact that 20 six year olds were gunned down in the most violent fashion possible and this town could n't do anything about it was stunning to me , " he said			0
@entity2 's remarks came hours after a student opened fire at a high school near @entity45 , @entity46 , killing a classmate before turning the gun on himself			1
the incident joined a list of dozens of shooting incidents at @entity1 schools , campuses and public areas that have taken place since the 2012 @entity21 massacre			1
just sunday , two police officers in @entity58 were shot and killed while eating lunch			0
" the country has to do some soul searching about this , " he said			0
" this is becoming norm			0
" ramping up restrictions on gun sales was a top priority of @entity2 's after @entity21			1
a bipartisan measure that would have mandated background checks on gun sales failed to pass the @entity71 the following april , and other proposed measures , like a ban on assault weapons , garnered little support among lawmakers			0
the failure of it all was seen as a major defeat for the president , who led the nation in mourning for the students and teachers killed in @entity22			1
without congressional support , @entity2 signed dozens of unilateral executive actions meant to quell gun violence			1
though broad action , like banning assault weapons or high capacity magazines , still require congressional approval			0
on monday , @entity2 said the @entity1 was the only developed country on @entity92 where mass shootings occur with regularity , adding that " if public opinion does not change , we 're not going to change			1
" and he shot down arguments that mental health was more to blame for mass killings than access to guns			2
" the @entity1 does not have a monopoly on crazy people			2
it 's not the only country that has psychosis , " he said			0
" and yet we kill each other in these mass shootings at rates that are exponentially higher than any place else			1
well , what 's the difference ? the difference is that these guys can stack up a bunch of ammunition in their houses and that 's sort of par for the course			0
" politicians from both parties are " terrified " of the @entity123 , @entity2 said , saying the gun rights organization was well - funded and able to influence elections to prevent any significant new gun regulations from becoming law			2
late in the day on @entity130 , @entity129 rep. @entity128 stood before the chamber and could barely get the words out about the violence earlier in the day in his district at @entity135 in @entity136			0
" in a scene that is achingly familiar , this morning at @entity138 a shooting occurred , a student killed , the shooter died , a teacher wounded , " he said			2
the chamber then observed a moment of silence			0
