@entity0 -- the snow was here , two weeks ago			0
with just a smattering of white , it wreaked havoc on the @entity8			0
but it may have been just an opening round			0
now , an ice storm is hitting			1
and matched with snow , it 's the heavyweight of the two			2
weather mavens expect up to an inch of ice will give broad swaths of the @entity8 a good shellacking			1
an inch does n't sound impressive ? a foot of snow may look big and bad , but it 's a bunch of fluff compared to a solid inch of ice			1
here 's why : it 's heavier for starters , ice weighs much , much more			1
that branch hanging over your roof with a shiny glaze of ice might as well be piled high with nearly three feet of snow			2
" ice increases the weight of branches by about 30 times compared to snow , " said @entity1 meteorologist @entity34			1
got about half an inch of ice on your power lines ? depending upon distance between the telephone poles holding them , it can add about 500 pounds to a line , @entity34 said			1
how bad will this get ? and when laden branches crash down on those wires , a lot of lights go out			2
that 's how more than 500,000 homes lost power in the storm of 2000 , as it 's known in the @entity8			1
and it took days to get them back on line			0
given that , what 's rolling up on the horizon now does not bode well for the grid			2
" when you 're talking about that amount of ice we 're looking at , it 's catastrophic , " @entity62 emergency chief @entity61			1
" it 's pricey and messy , " @entity34 said			2
" a 1998 ice storm in northern @entity70 caused over a billion dollars in damage			1
" it 's slicker ever wonder why we call them " snow tires " and not " ice tires " ? people in places that get a lot of snow know this : you can drive on it			1
it 's a little like brittle , it breaks up as you drive on it , " said @entity86 meteorologist @entity85 said			2
" if you get even a 10th of an inch of ice on a road , it 's like a skating rink			1
" yes , snow - covered roads kill			0
but the bigger culprit in any snow storm is ice			1
as cars travel across the snow , the heat from the tires melts it			0
when the cold weather refreezes it , the flakes compact into a thin sheet of ice			0
that 's exactly what happened in @entity0 two weeks ago			0
it was n't the snow			0
it was the thin layer of ice that turned a metropolitan area of 6 million into a parking lot			0
stir - crazy ? how to stay sane worse still is freezing rain , which makes for a motorist 's arch nemesis -- black ice			1
you think it 's dry road , but it 's not			1
and by the time you notice , it 's way too late			0
it 's destructive ice on roads also leaves behind scars when it 's gone			2
it flows into cracks and crevices as water -- on and under street surfaces , for example -- and then it freezes hard like stone			0
why not put power lines underground ? in the process , it expands and can break things			1
take the ice storm that hit northern @entity146 in december			1
it left hundreds of potholes on roads , highways and interstates			0
around the same time , auto body shops in northern @entity146 also talked of seeing repairs surge -- from wheels tally - whacked out of alignment to busted mufflers			0
it lingers icy danger lingers longer , because ice holds on longer than snow , @entity34 said			0
ever notice those piles of snow in yards and parking lots that need days more to melt after the rest of the snow is long gone ? most snow gets dirty after a day or two , which makes it absorb more of the sun 's rays and melt quicker , @entity34 said			0
ice is solid and hardly takes in dirt			0
so it reflects much of the sun 's rays and , as a result , melts more slowly .			2

ice adds much more weight to branches and power lines
a 1998 ice storm in northern @entity70 caused over a billion dollars in damage
" if you get even a 10th of an inch of ice on a road , it 's like a skating rink , " an *official* says
after the ice melts , drivers then must contend with potholes
