-- in 1834 , @entity1 voted whether to adopt @entity2 as a legal holiday			1
among those voting " nay " was the young @entity5			2
in 1834 , @entity5 had not yet grown out of his atheist phase , but the young @entity5 's lack of faith in @entity9 -- and his lifelong disbelief in the divinity of @entity12 -- does not explain his vote			1
in 1834 , a vote against @entity2 was a safe , even a conventional vote			1
not a single state in the @entity16 closed its offices for @entity2 on december 25 in 1834			1
@entity5 marked his first @entity2 as president , in december 1861 , by holding a @entity20 meeting in the morning and a dinner party in the evening			1
the @entity5 family never had a @entity24 tree and sent no @entity2 cards			1
nobody was much shocked by these omissions			0
the public @entity2 as @entity28 know it today did not take form until late in the 19th century			1
@entity30 issued a proclamation on @entity32 , but he never made any statement about @entity2 ( or @entity35 for that matter )			2
the first state to recognize @entity2 as a holiday was @entity39 , in 1836 , but the @entity40 and especially @entity41 resisted			1
not until 1856 did @entity42 accept @entity2 as a holiday			1
the federal government took until 1870 to follow			0
there 's debate on the point , but it seems that @entity49 was the first president to allow a christmas tree inside the @entity24 in 1889			0
the tradition of lighting a tree on the @entity24 grounds commenced with @entity54 in 1923			0
@entity55 sent the first @entity24 christmas cards			0
@entity55 's cards , however , were always determinedly " seasonal			0
" it waited until @entity59 in 1963 to send a card that depicted a nativity scene			0
this late flowering of @entity2 observance reflects two facts about @entity2 that seldom get much attention in our public debates about the " war on @entity2			1
" in its first century , the national government practiced a separation of church and state far sharper than anything @entity28 would accept today			1
one example : from its founding in 1775 , the federal post office delivered mail on sundays			0
as evangelical forms of @entity78 spread after 1800 , the new denominations demanded an end to this desecration of the sabbath			0
some postmasters took it upon themselves to close operations			0
in response , @entity85 voted in 1810 to require all postmasters to work at least one hour on sunday , on pain of losing their positions			0
the @entity28 of the founding generations insisted upon separation of church and state not because they were irreligious , but precisely because so many of them were so very intensely religious			1
because religion mattered so much to early @entity28 , so did religious differences			1
calvinists and @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 , the grandest @entity100 rector and the rawest frontier preacher disagreed , sometimes to the point of outright violence			0
anti-catholic riots ripped apart @entity100 , @entity105 and @entity106 , @entity107 , between the 1830s and 1850s			0
these contending denominations could , however , agree at least that they did not want a remote government in @entity111 favoring some religious practices over others			0
better to deliver the mail on sunday than debate who was right about the @entity81			0
better to issue no religious proclamations than let presidents pick and choose which holy days to mark and how to mark them			0
a second fact also explains the coolness of the early national government to @entity78 : the keen awareness of many 19th century @entity124 of the @entity126 origins of many @entity2 traditions			1
@entity2 is celebrated near the date of the old roman holiday of @entity130			1
gift - giving on the day was also a @entity133 tradition			0
the christmas tree , the hanging of wreaths and house - to - house caroling hark back to the pre-christian @entity139 holiday of @entity140			2
calvinists had abandoned their outright ban on @entity2 observance on the late 17th century			1
but many @entity145 denominations retained a lingering suspicion of the holiday until deep into the 19th century			1
two changes made possible the coalescing of an official @entity2 holiday over the 40 years from @entity54 's outdoor christmas tree to @entity59 's sacral @entity2 card : the fading of distinctions between @entity124 and the decline of theology within @entity78			1
the once all - crucial distinctions between @entity141 and @entity159 ( whose beliefs came from @entity161 reformist @entity160 ) and between even @entity145 and @entity98 have blurred			0
the once - vivid mistrust of trees and tinsel and burning logs has vanished , as @entity166 evolved away from a creed in which people believed and into a set of practices that people did			0
if @entity124 decorate trees , then tree decorating must be @entity78 -- no matter how or why the custom started and what the custom meant to the people who started it			0
devout @entity78 believers can still be counted in the millions of course			0
surrounding them , however , is a larger and more nebulous group for whom what was once a faith has become a folkway			2
for them , a christmas tree or a nativity scene is less a declaration of individual belief than it is an expression of group identity			0
many @entity28 feel this group identity to be under threat by changes in recent years			1
when they champion " @entity2 as it was , " they do not mean " @entity2 as it was for @entity30 or @entity5 " and much less " @entity2 as it was for @entity196 or @entity197			1
" they mean , " @entity2 as it was when i was young			2
" that is why we have eruptions such as last week 's flap over the whiteness of @entity204			2
if your @entity2 celebrates the appearance of @entity207 in the form of a human baby , it wo n't have a lot of room for a gift - giving elf and flying reindeer			2
but if @entity204 is at most tangential to the @entity2 of faith , he is utterly central to the @entity2 of folkway			2
it is the @entity2 that is the @entity2 so passionately defended by those who talk about " the war on @entity2			2
" the @entity2 of @entity204 and @entity219 , and trees and stockings , and candy canes and " @entity224 " greetings began to be most publicly celebrated in the @entity28 only after -- and only because -- the religious impetus for the holiday had already dwindled away			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity229 .			2

@entity229 : @entity5 , like many in 1834 , did n't observe @entity2 as an official holiday
he says in late 19th century , @entity28 began to observe @entity2 as a public holiday
early @entity28 kept a sharp separation of church and state , @entity229 says
@entity229 : " @entity238 " flap a reaction to a *perceived* threat to folkway , not religion
