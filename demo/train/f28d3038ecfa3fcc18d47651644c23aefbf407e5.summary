she said that she never felt the effects of the powerful sleep aid in her system			0
@entity1 is facing a misdemeanor charge of driving while intoxicated for allegedly swerving between lanes and careening into a tractor - trailer on a @entity20 , @entity5 , interstate in july 2012			1
she drove away from the accident scene despite a shredded tire , and was found collapsed over the steering wheel of her @entity24 a short time later , according to testimony			1
@entity1 has said she swallowed a pill she believed to be her thyroid medication at around 7:30 the morning of the incident , but that she may have mixed up medicine bottles and taken zolpidem , a powerful sleep aid , instead			1
a blood test confirmed the presence of zolpidem in @entity1 's system , according to trial testimony this week			1
" i now know thanks to the tox lab that i must have taken the sleeping medication by mistake , " said @entity1 , looking at the jury as she testified			1
@entity1 said she made cappuccino , had some carrots , prepared bags for the gym and office and had no problem leaving her apartment and getting to her vehicle the morning of the accident			1
her memory from that morning ends just before she entered the highway , @entity1 said			1
the next thing she recalls is a knock on the window of her suv , and a man she thought was a police officer asking if she was ok			0
" i was confused by that because i thought i was fine , " she said on the stand			0
during a contentious cross examination , @entity1 insisted that she would not have stayed behind the wheel if she 'd felt the effects of the medication			1
" if i 'd realized i was impaired , i would have pulled over , " she told prosecutor @entity63 , and also said she does n't know what the side effects of zolpidem might feel like			1
" you 've taken this pill for 10 years and you ca n't tell me whether or not it makes you feel tired after you take it ? " @entity71 asked			0
" i guess i do n't really think about how i 'm feeling when i take it , " @entity1 replied			1
" i take it , and then i 'm asleep			0
" the jury has heard testimony from 15 witnesses in the case , and could begin its deliberations thursday			0
defense attorney @entity79 told @entity0 wednesday afternoon that a forensic pharmacologist was the only remaining defense witness			0
sitting in court was @entity1 's mother , @entity83 , and younger sister @entity85 , who was a defense witness			1
@entity1 said she used zolpidem for travel across time zones but had never taken it in the morning			1
she testified that she normally kept the 10 mg pills in a sealed plastic bag in the medicine cabinet , away from her thyroid medication , but on july 13 , 2012 , she had both medications on the vanity because she was packing for a trip			0
the night before the accident , @entity1 said on the stand , she 'd been to a cocktail party but did not drink because she was driving home			1

under direct examination by her lawyer , @entity107 , @entity1 described her human rights work and her healthy lifestyle , saying she visited the gym often and kept an organic garden			1
at the start of her defense case tuesday , @entity1 watched with a smile as @entity115 described their close relationship			2
" she 's really my best friend , " @entity115 on the stand			0
when asked about her sister 's reputation for truthfulness , she said , " she wrote the book called ' @entity124 ' about her commitment to justice and truth , and that 's what she has devoted her life to			0
" trial opens with video of sobriety tests , claim of ' sleep driving ' a growing group of supporters has sat in the rows behind the defendant throughout the two trial days , including sister @entity140 , brothers @entity141 and @entity143 , and their mother , who is 85			2
jurors heard from @entity146 , a drug - detection specialist with @entity148 who evaluated @entity1 after the crash			2
some three hours after she allegedly failed three roadside sobriety tests , @entity1 passed those same tests with flying colors , testified @entity146			2
finding no signs of intoxication , @entity146 instead began to suspect that @entity1 's car accident and disoriented state had been the result of a medical condition , he said			1
@entity1 herself was also worried , and asked for a vial of the blood drawn from her at @entity163 , said @entity146 : " she was concerned and she wanted to know what happened to her			2
" @entity1 remained at the hospital overnight for observation			2
during opening statements monday , assistant district attorney @entity168 said that even if @entity1 , 54 , had taken the sleep aid unintentionally , she had a responsibility to pull her vehicle off the road safely when she began to feel its effects			2
@entity107 disputed that argument , saying @entity1 had no time to react			2
" the zolpidem kicks in , it shuts her down , she 's in a state of ' sleep driving , ' " he said			0
tuesday , jurors watched another member of @entity1 's defense team spar with an expert witness about the effects of the drug			2
laboratory director @entity186 conceded that zolpidem is " a very potent , fast - acting hypnotic , " that begins to hamper cognitive ability and motor skills within 15 - 45 minutes			0
its effect on @entity1 would have peaked at around 9 a.m. , testified @entity192 , roughly the time @entity1 failed an initial round of sobriety tests by police after a motorist called 911			0
@entity192 was asked by prosecutor @entity71 whether zolpidem is a " knock - out pill , " and replied that the drug would need time to enter the blood stream and brain before it takes full effect			0
" and , prior to the time the drug takes effect , does a person still have brain function ? do they still have decision - making ability ? " asked @entity71			0
" yes , " replied @entity192			0
if convicted , @entity1 could face up to one year in prison .			0
