-- it would n't be an election year without @entity3 exhibiting its usual despicable efforts to keep residents from voting			1
after the 2000 debacle where the nation had to contend with hanging chads , ballots not being counted , more lawyering than anyone ever needs to deal with , and finally a @entity15 @entity14 ruling , you would think officials there would do all they can to stay out of the news			2
but , no. leave it to the state legislature and gov. @entity21 to create another mess that could have easily been avoided			1
this time , it 's the purging of the state 's voting rolls in an effort to keep @entity15 noncitizens from voting			1
according to @entity21 , potentially 182,000 voters on the rolls are noncitizens			1
now there is nothing wrong with any state ensuring that those who are eligible to vote are @entity15 citizens			0
but when it comes to @entity3 , they did n't even take the necessary precautions to ensure that folks who are legal citizens would n't be a part of their purge process			0
the big question is , why now ? why would @entity3 , with a statewide vote coming up in 90 days , choose now of all times to do this ? that 's a question the @entity46 is asking			1
@entity47 , chief lawyer in the @entity46 's voting rights division , wrote a two - page letter to @entity3 officials asking why they chose to make this move without consulting the feds , an apparent violation of the @entity54			1
civil rights groups are naturally outraged because in 2000 @entity3 purged thousands from its rolls			2
most of them were minority , and a substantial number were law - abiding residents who never should have been stricken			0
in @entity63 , officials sent 1,500 letters to voters saying they were potentially noncitizens , and nearly one - third of them provided proof that they were indeed @entity15			2
what kind of failure rate is that to be proud of ? this action follows the draconian voter suppression law -- supporters call it voter protection -- that was passed by the @entity3 legislature , which was so ridiculous and punitive that the nonpartisan @entity77 and @entity76 ! chose not to register voters out of fear of amassing substantial fines			2
a federal judge has ordered @entity3 to stop enforcing several provisions of that law			0
it is shameful that @entity84 in @entity3 are concerned with blocking @entity15 from the ballots out of some ridiculous fear of noncitizens voting			1
and they should be embarrassed by their actions , which include questioning the citizenship of 91 - year - old @entity90 , a @entity91 veteran			0
@entity90 was a medic during the war and earned the @entity93 in the @entity94			0
he was also bestowed with the @entity95 by @entity96			0
but because of @entity3 's voter purge plan , he got a letter saying he had 30 days to prove he was an @entity15 or he would be stricken from the voter rolls			1
@entity90 fought for democracy overseas , only to have partisan hacks question his legitimacy			0
@entity21 should have the decency to call @entity104 and offer him a personal apology for the insulting letter			0
the @entity46 should be aggressive in demanding that @entity3 , and any other state , is n't taking action that is detrimental to @entity15 exercising their right to vote			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity112			0
