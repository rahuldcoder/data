-- it 's sacrilege to some @entity3 fanboys			0
it 's also something none of @entity3 's competitors have been able to claim since that " magical " day in early 2010			2
but when @entity8 unveiled the surface tablet ( actually a pair of them ) monday , the software company clearly had one ultimate goal : to make a tablet that 's better than the @entity14			1
by most standards , @entity3 has crushed its tablet rivals that have tried to compete feature - for - feature			0
no single tablet running @entity21 's @entity20 system has gotten much traction ( save the smaller , cheaper @entity23 from @entity24 ) and @entity26 maker @entity25 hit the market with a thud			0
and @entity8 's past attempts at building @entity3 - like gadgets -- witness the @entity32 - copying @entity31 -- have failed			1
unlike some hasty competitors , @entity8 took its time getting into the tablet game			1
earlier this year , the company rolled out the @entity38 operating system , software that is optimized for mobile and that manufacturers such as @entity42 and @entity43 are already building tablets around			0
but @entity8 clearly wanted to control at least one version of the hardware , a move it has largely shied away from during its history			0
and @entity8 seems determined to get this one right			0
so , the question remains -- will this be the tablet that finally gives @entity3 a run for its money ? details about the @entity55 are sketchy -- no price or release date were announced , and info about apps is scant			1
but there are at least five features ceo @entity62 and friends showed off monday that might make the @entity55 better than the @entity14			1
keyboard a frustration for many users of the @entity14 and other touchscreen devices is the keyboard			1
while it 's possible to get somewhat proficient at tapping spots on a flat screen , most acknowledge it 's impossible to get e-mail and other documents written as quickly as with physical keys			0
sure , there are third - party keyboards you can buy to add onto the @entity14 , but they can be clunky			1
the @entity55 keyboard will be part of its @entity81 , which is connected with magnets and flips open			1
there will be a version with pressure - sensitive flat keys and another with more traditional raised keys called a @entity87			0
they 're both sleeker and thinner than many of the third - party offerings for the @entity14			2
the @entity81 is 3 millimeters thick , and the type cover is 5 millimeters			0
and for the style - sensitive among us , they 'll come in a variety of colors , including black , pink , red and blue			0
some folks see the inclusion of a keyboard as the @entity55 's big selling point			1
" if it works well , the keyboard -- which i got to inspect at great length but not actually type on -- is going to be the @entity55 's killer attraction , " wrote @entity103 's @entity102			1
" lots of people get frustrated with the @entity14 because typing on it is a major chore			0
they want to use it like a full - fledged desktop , but they 're stymied by the input method			0
... if the @entity55 ships with the keyboard -- and if @entity8 markets the device as a tablet that will let you get some work done -- it could be a big hit			1
" add the machine 's trackpad and built - in " kickstand , " and you 've got usability features that current @entity14 do n't possess			1
size @entity3 has made such a compact , stylish tablet that many of its competitors look chunky by comparison			0
that 's not true of the surface , at least as it was demoed monday			2
first , its display screen is 10.6 inches , almost a full inch bigger than the @entity14 's			2
and the company says it 's optimized to have essentially the same dimensions as a movie screen : so , farewell black bars when watching video			0
the @entity143 is a fraction of a millimeter thinner than the @entity14 ( 9.3 vs. 9.4 ) , while the heftier surface for @entity145 will be 13.5 millimeters			2
the @entity146 weighs virtually the same as the @entity14 ( it 's less than an ounce heavier ) , while the @entity150 will be around 2 pounds			2
the @entity55 's @entity81 , with the keyboard , is 3 millimeters thick			1
" every micron matters within @entity55 , " @entity8 's @entity152 said monday			1
power especially with the @entity145 model , @entity8 has set out to blur the line between tablets and the new wave of light , slim ultrabooks and their predecessor , @entity3 's @entity161			2
tablets have always been a hybrid hovering somewhere between a smartphone and a laptop , best used for game playing , web surfing and media consumption			0
@entity8 wants the @entity55 to be something you can actually do some work on			1
the @entity173 model will run on an i5 @entity175 processor and come with up to 128 gigabytes of internal memory ( the @entity14 currently goes up to 64 )			0
usb ports both versions of the @entity55 come with two usb ports ( 2.0 on the @entity146 and a faster 3.0 on the @entity173 )			1
the lack of ports has been one of the few persistent compaints about the @entity14			2
these ports open up the possibility of extra storage , printing and other external capabilities that should be easier and quicker than the workarounds @entity14 users need involving cloud storage , @entity193 connections and the like			1
@entity194 the @entity194 feature , which @entity8 rolled out at this month 's @entity197 video gaming expo , will work with the @entity14 and @entity20 tablets			1
but it 's not hard to envision @entity8 optimizing the technology for its own piece of hardware			2
the system looks to make the @entity194 a central device in the living room -- one that may or may not be even used for video games			0
it will connect a smartphone or tablet with the @entity194 , which in turn will be connected with the television			0
by connecting the devices , users can watch a movie on their television while getting bonus material on their tablet			0
they could also start enjoying a game or movie on the tablet , then transfer it to a tv -- or vice versa			0
if the feature is front and center on the @entity55 , it will be one more step in @entity8 's push to bring all of a user 's devices together within the flexible @entity38 system .			1

from early showing , @entity8 's surface tablet could be *superior* to the @entity14 in some ways
a built - in keyboard and trackpad will make surface easier for some to use
it has usb ports , making printing and external storage *simpler*
no price or release date has been announced for the @entity55 , unveiled monday
