-- which way will the housing market go ? that 's the million - dollar question for so many @entity4 who are underwater on their mortgages and for the one in three who rents and represents the homeowners of tomorrow			1
we 've all heard about how real estate prices have crashed			2
but in every time of hazard , there 's also great opportunity to build long - term wealth			1
you just need the guts to zig when others zag			2
in this chapter , i 'll show you how you can score a deal on a distressed property , reduce your mortgage interest rate , lower your property taxes and save money on some of the major purchases for your home , like appliances			1
i 'll also warn you about common pitfalls , including burglar alarm monitoring and home warranties and other things that are way out there , like electronic mortgage fraud			1
before you buy : short sales and deeds in lieu are the new foreclosures whether you 're a buyer or a seller , a short sale or a deed in lieu of foreclosure may present a way to get out from underneath an upside - down house or get a great deal on distressed real estate			1
for a seller , a short sale is one in which you work with a lender to market your home and sell it for less than the mortgage balance			1
while short sales were once considered more favorable than foreclosures , now both harm your credit to the same degree , lowering your score by roughly 140 to 150 points			0
as a mark on your credit file , they 'll each stay with you for seven years			0
for a buyer , a short sale can mean getting a home at a great price if you 're willing to play what can be a long waiting game			1
about two years ago , lenders agreed to guidelines in which they were supposed to acknowledge an offer on a short sale in four days and answer back in 45			0
but that never happened in practice , and typical wait times on an offer are substantially longer			0
@entity79 , at 27 the youngest producer on my radio show , recently put bids in on seven short - sale properties , month after month , for the better part of a year			0
all his offers were turned down			0
finally , his eighth attempt worked , and he got his short sale for $ 89,000 with a 15 - year loan at 4.375 %			0
the property had last sold for $ 155,000 ! it took great sacrifices for @entity79 to come to the closing table with enough money for a 20 % down payment			1
but he did it , and now his monthly mortgage note is $ 560 , not including taxes and insurance			0
some people have monthly car payments that are higher than his mortgage payment			1
one special warning for sellers : be careful with the paperwork your lender gives you as part of the short - sale agreement			0
some lenders are behaving immorally and slipping in legalese that makes their financial loss your legal obligation to pay back			0
that is not the intent or purpose of a short sale			0
in today 's market , deeds in lieu offer what i believe is a better alternative to short sales for sellers			1
with deeds in lieu , the bank agrees to take your home back without foreclosing on it			1
it also agrees not to seek deficiency , which is loss on the loan that banks are entitled to in most states			0
as a bonus , deeds in lieu have much less impact on your credit score than does a short sale or a foreclosure			0
so at this point i 'm recommending that if you absolutely need to get out from under your house , a deed in lieu should be your first choice and a short sale your second			1
never buy property without looking at it over the years , con artists got notoriously rich by selling people @entity151 swampland			1
this rip - off was especially popular in the 1960s and 1970s when future retirees bought property that was basically worthless because it was all wet			0
it became such a well - known scam that it did n't work anymore -- until the mid- 2000s when what was old became new again and the con artists came back to prey on another generation			0
sometimes people are all too quick to buy a dream and will suspend disbelief to buy land without seeing it			1
one of the new equivalents of swampland in @entity151 has been desert land in @entity169			1
the @entity170 reported that @entity171 , @entity169 , intended to file charges against cons who had sold parcels of land over the phone and @entity178 to 3,000 people in the @entity4 , @entity180 and @entity181			1
the land was supposedly adjacent to a city			1
but when people would go to @entity169 to see their new homestead , they 'd find that no such city even existed			2
worse still , the land they 'd purchased could not be developed because to do so would violate local and state zoning laws			2
this new twist on the old rip - off scheme of land speculation started when cons took advantage of a @entity169 land rush and bought up property that was parched and desolate			2
then they illegally subdivided the land and sold five - acre spreads			2
the @entity170 article was cute in a way			0
they sent a reporter to find one of these " conveniently located " parcels in @entity207 , @entity169			0
the reporter got to the location -- some 150 miles away from the nearest big city -- and found an area where the only inhabitants were a snake , a beetle and large ants ! i have two simple rules to follow when buying land			1
first , never buy property without seeing it			2
second , make sure the land has water rights or it 's going to be useless to you			1
this second caveat is especially important if you 're buying in one of the mountain states , like @entity169			2
use a home inspector before buying or selling if you are considering buying a house , i urge you to have your own inspection			1
first - time homeowners often skip the inspection because they think government workers have somehow inspected the house			2
although they have , these kinds of inspections are not enough			0
think about when a hospital , school , or office building is erected			0
there is a construction manager who makes sure things are being done as they should be			0
you want someone who does the same thing for you			0
it 's especially important if you 're having the house built			1
be sure you do n't hire an inspector your real estate agent recommends			0
recent reports show that 70 % of people do this			2
agents suggest only those inspectors who they know will not kill their deal , and that is not in your best interest			0
you want someone who will kill the deal if the house is not in good shape			2
two sites that offer great referrals are the @entity265 ' website at @entity266 and the @entity267 at @entity268			0
@entity267 requires that its inspectors carry errors and omissions liability insurance , which means they accept responsibility for any oversight			0
you also want someone who is certified by the @entity275 ( @entity275 ) , which means they are current on all building codes			0
spend some additional money when buying a house and get an inspection			1
and before you sign a contract with a home builder , make sure you inspect the contract			1
some builders forbid you from hiring an inspector and that wording is included in the contract			0
so if you see it in there , give that builder the boot			0
the same idea applies when you 're selling a home			2
before you go to market , you should hire an inspector to carefully vet your home			2
be sure to fix whatever needs repair , and have the inspector 's report and your receipts available for prospective buyers to examine			2
as a seller , you have to psychologically try to get inside the head of a buyer			0
even though a buyer might consider a used home , they still want it to be as perfect as a doll house			1
so let 's say a corner of your roof needs repair and you do n't spend the money to fix it			1
when their inspector finds it , the buyer is more likely to blow the cost of the potential repair out of proportion and make a lower offer on your house accordingly			1
