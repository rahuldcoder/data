-- when the 2,455th star on the @entity3 is laid on monday for actor @entity4 , @entity1 will once again be working behind the scenes as curator - in - chief to the iconic attraction			1
the @entity8 is one of showbiz 's most visible landmarks , and @entity1 has been its inconspicuous producer for almost half the attraction 's 51 years , making sure the constellation of stars is perfectly aligned on the @entity3 sidewalks			1
for 24 years , she has been the person deciding where celebrities will receive their coveted symbol of fame in the heart of @entity21			0
when a star is unveiled to the international press corps , @entity1 is the field marshal orchestrating every detail of one of showbiz 's alpha moments			1
" if there was one phrase to describe @entity34 , it would be mistress of ceremonies , " said @entity29 , the former chairman of the board for the @entity30			2
" she truly is a master of the ceremonies			2
" @entity1 has produced 586 star ceremonies			1
on monday , @entity1 will be at the ready with clipboard and @entity39 in hand , negotiating over an obstacle course that typically numbers 22 film crews with 39 people , 22 still photographers , eight wire photographers , three newspaper reporters , two radio reporters , two photographers from the @entity30 and sometimes a celebrity 's personal photographer			1
" she is a gatekeeper of the integrity of the @entity8			0
at the same time she 's responsible for promoting the @entity53 , " said @entity29			2
a star is awarded after a lengthy process in which hundreds of nomination applications are sent to the @entity3 chamber , and then its @entity53 committee selects the winners , with the approval of the chamber 's board of directors			1
the names also are submitted to the city of @entity66 ' @entity65			0
the chamber requires a $ 30,000 " sponsorship fee , " often paid by a studio , recording label or even a group of fans , chamber officials said			0
@entity1 also coordinates when her boss , the president of the @entity30 , and various political figures speak in honor of the star			1
@entity66 mayor @entity78 recognizes the importance of the walk as a civic landmark			0
he said it is " a powerful magnet which brings people from around the world to @entity66			0
" " @entity1 and the @entity87 have played a vital role cementing @entity66 's reputation as the creativity capital of the world , " @entity78 said in a written statement to @entity0			1
it 's clear that @entity1 loves what she does			1
@entity1 , who is 5 feet 4 inches with shoulder - length brown hair , declined to give her age , but said she started her career at the chamber as a receptionist in her early 20s after a brief stint at @entity100			1
she assisted the then - publicist in handling the @entity8			0
the publicist left the chamber six months later and even though @entity1 was the obvious person to fill the role , management initially hesitated			1
" the other staff and management said i was too nice , too shy , " @entity1 said			1
but @entity1 eventually evolved in a way many stars do			1
" i had to create a different persona for the ( star ) ceremonies , " she said			1
" i have to control everything			0
" with her staple head - to - toe black regalia to her dark shades -- green or gray depending on how bright it is outside -- she definitely controls the event			0
when singer @entity119 received her star in november , fans turned out in full force			0
the emotional followers swelled to nearly a thousand and nearly spilled over barricades when they saw their idol			0
@entity1 said she welcomes fans because it also is a big day for them , but she keeps a close eye on security			1
when one enthusiastic @entity119 fan jumped over a barrier to meet his idol , the no - nonsense show - runner sprang into action			0
" i grabbed his wrist , pushed him back and our security girl carried him out , " @entity1 said			1
then of course , there is the celebrity			0
@entity1 often already knows each family member and friend of the star by name before they arrive			1
she keeps a close eye on her @entity39 , looking to see if the stars are on schedule in order to greet them and their entourages and lead them through the ceremony			0
after the celebrity gives his or her speech , @entity1 quickly directs them to the star , which is then unveiled			1
the media , who are packed in a tightly sectioned - off sidewalk space around the star , attempt to get a shot of the celebrity			1
@entity1 decides in advance where each media organization will be positioned			1
@entity1 streamlines the production and cues the stars and their entourages on which cameras they should direct their gaze to and for how long			1
within a few hours , thousands of the images @entity1 orchestrates from the ceremony permeate the @entity171			1
though @entity1 's career involves cementing names on the walk , she knows the faces in @entity3 often change as quickly as the styles on the city 's storefront displays			1
but she has been a constant in the city , a meaningful achievement in @entity3 's transient culture , where broken dreams predominate			1
she has also watched @entity3 drastically change from a seedier era when prostitutes and adult bookstores reigned on the streets			1
" we do n't have that any more , " said @entity1			1
" @entity3 has changed , even the @entity8 has changed			1
" she credits former star and honorary @entity3 mayor @entity190 for the redevelopment			1
" the @entity192 [ @entity192 ] money was going to go to another state -- he went and talked to the attorney general and convinced them to keep the money in @entity3			2
that 's why you have ( the ) @entity3 and @entity201 ( @entity200 )			1
" as @entity3 evolved , so did the number of stars on the @entity8			2
@entity1 said the walk she and @entity190 oversaw brought tourists to @entity3			1
" every day it 's mobbed with people			0
in the summer it 's booming			0
they want to be near the @entity8 , and what is now the hub of @entity3			2
" in her time at the chamber , @entity1 has become a sort of encyclopedia for the @entity8			2
she can rattle off where every star is , who was late to the ceremony and which awards of the 300 - pound marble monuments caused controversy			2
@entity222 's @entity53 moment was one of those			0
@entity1 said @entity190 dealt with the outcry			2
" @entity222 allegedly said some anti-semitic comments and they called @entity190			0
... he says , ' if we move the star for every person that might have said something , there would be no @entity8 , ' " she said , remembering @entity190 's no - nonsense business attitude			1
even in a moment of panic , @entity1 is the consummate businesswoman			2
@entity29 said he sees the resemblance between @entity1 and her mentor			2
" you get how serious she is just from her tone of voice , " @entity29 said			0
" and people do n't cross it			0
when he used to run the ceremonies , people did n't mess with @entity190 either			0
" @entity1 does n't just promote the celebrities , she promotes an entire tourist attraction that is recognized around the globe			2
the walk " brings a lot of people to the community , " she said			0
she recalled an earthquake that shook @entity66 many years ago and how the tourists did n't budge			0
" nothing fazed , them			0
they want to be where their celebrity has stood , " @entity1 said			2
not every part of the star construction has always gone so smoothly , however			0
just hours before @entity268 ' star ceremony took place , a @entity0 producer walking by noticed the star 's name was missing the hyphen and the " o " in " @entity274			2
" " i was really upset			0
i pride myself on everything going perfect , " said @entity1			2
she now has the star installers text a picture of the lettering before they cement it into the star , she said			0
even though it was one of the roughest days of her career , @entity1 focuses on the positive : " it turned out to be the best thing ever			2
" " we had so much publicity we might do it again , " she joked			0
there were no hard feelings over that celebrity snafu			0
actress @entity268 called it her " @entity293 moment			0
" there are several stars @entity1 hopes to add to the walk			2
she said she is saving a spot in front of @entity299 for @entity300			0
including him in the @entity8 would be additionally meaningful , she said , because not even her mentor was able to get him			0
" that 's the one @entity190 always wanted , " @entity1 said			1
" it will be an accomplished goal			0
