disabled people , elderly people , adults made vulnerable by terminal and other illnesses , and now children are being told that their lives are not worth living			2
this view was forcefully expressed by professor @entity8 in a recent public debate on euthanasia in @entity11			2
one of the authors of @entity14 's controversial euthanasia law , @entity8 said it had been specifically designed to include disabled people			1
for @entity8 it seemed obvious that " a man with no arms or legs " would want to die			0
without conscience or insight into the discrimination of choosing only disabled people as examples , he shouted at a member of the audience " just wait until you are paralysed			0
" a paraplegic wheelchair - user for forty years , i was sitting directly in front of him , and had spoken before the debate			0
his chilling and very final solution to suffering is to remove the sufferer			1
his zealous delivery caused a frisson in the room amongst most ( though sadly not all ) of the audience			0
with its clear echoes , this discourse from a government adviser was shocking			0
earlier in the same debate , @entity42 of the @entity43 had pointed out that the law in @entity14 is just not safe : - nearly half ( 47 % ) of euthanasia deaths are not reported ( according to a study carried out in @entity49 in 2007 ) : this is illegal			1
- @entity52 deaths should be carried out by doctors , but according to a 2007 study , nurses are doing them : this is illegal			0
- some euthanasia deaths are carried out without consent ( according to a 2007 study in @entity49 ) : this is illegal			2
the opposite view : pray you never need euthanasia , but be glad of option dr. @entity65 , a leading promoter of euthanasia , admitted that there are problems with @entity14 's euthanasia law			1
but despite its " imperfections " he still believes it should be extended to children			2
@entity65 argued euthanasia was necessary to remove suffering : yet pain is hardly ever the reason for seeking euthanasia			1
in fact , any palliative care specialist will say no - one should ever be in intolerable pain			0
@entity65 claims dr. @entity81 as his protege : @entity81 recently ended the life of @entity85 / @entity84 , in front of tv cameras			2
after a series of botched sex - change operations , in the absence of other support , @entity84 sought refuge in death by euthanasia			0
the @entity14 commission to regulate the practice of euthanasia has never referred a case of euthanasia to prosecutors ( and remember only half of those are reported )			1
it is co-chaired by @entity103			0
it is fundamentally unsafe that the most high - profile doctor in @entity14 to carry out euthanasia is also the regulator			1
@entity81 also carried out the euthanasia of @entity109 and @entity110 , 45 - year - old identical twins , who were deaf and decided they wanted to die after their eyesight began to fail			0
@entity113 also opted to have her life ended after being sexually abused by the @entity14 psychiatrist who was supposed to be treating her for her life - threatening condition			1
the core of good clinical governance is patient safety but under @entity14 's euthanasia laws that is sacrificed in the name of individual choice			1
@entity84 , the @entity125 and @entity126 -- bereft of support -- felt they had no choice but death			0
the @entity130 has condemned @entity14 for violation of the @entity132 because of its lack of social care			2
it is little wonder that disabled @entity14 people fall into terminal despair , but that does not validate euthanasia becoming a " treatment " for depression as it has in @entity14			1
killing someone by lethal injection is not an act of medicine : it comes when medicine apparently has nothing left to offer			1
with a 500 % increase in euthanasia in @entity14 in ten years , it is crystal clear that the law in @entity14 is not safe ; we can not stand by as they try to extend that law to children			1
the opposite view : pray you never need euthanasia , but be glad of option interactive : euthanasia and the right to die around the world			0

@entity14 *mps* may allow terminally ill children and those with *dementia* access to euthanasia
@entity176 *campaigner* dr. @entity175 argues the *system* is unsafe
@entity179 : euthanasia *advocates* ' solution to suffering is to remove the sufferer
" killing someone by lethal injection is not an act of medicine "
