@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 on friday took his push for a health care overhaul to traditionally conservative @entity1 , saying a bill to extend coverage to the uninsured while helping those already with coverage will pass this year			1
president @entity3 discusses his health care plans friday at a meeting in @entity0 , @entity1			1
however , an influential @entity13 representative said the @entity14 would only pass a health care bill in january or later , signaling continuing rifts within @entity3 's party on his domestic priority for 2009			1
" we 're taking some time to make sure it 's done right , " said rep. @entity19 of @entity20			1
" i do n't know that we 'll get something done before january , and even then we may not get it done			2
we 're going to do it right when it 's finally done			0
" @entity3 told a largely supportive @entity1 audience at his second of three town hall meetings this week that fixing the health care system requires improving health insurance practices and reducing the costs of treatment			1
he sought questions from skeptics of his proposed health care overhaul , seeking to confront some misconceptions fueled by opponents @entity13 say are undermining the debate			1
one man who identified himself as a proud @entity41 supporter and believer in the @entity43 asked how the government would pay to expand health insurance coverage to 46 million uninsured people			2
" you ca n't tell us how you 're going to pay for this , " said the questioner , @entity47 , a welder from @entity48 , @entity1			0
" the only way you 're going to get the money is to raise our taxes			0
that 's the only way you can do that			0
" @entity3 responded with his oft - repeated explanation that two - thirds of the cost of overhauling health care -- estimated at about $ 900 billion over 10 years -- would come from eliminating waste and improving efficiency in the current system , which includes the government - run @entity65 and @entity66 programs for the elderly and impoverished			1
the rest would have to come from new revenue , he agreed with the questioner , and he called for reducing the amount of deductions that people making more than $ 250,000 a year can make on their income taxes			0
" if we did that alone , just that change alone ... that would raise enough to pay for health care reform , " @entity3 said , noting that would meet his election campaign pledge to avoid any tax increase on people earning less than $ 250,000 a year			1
however , @entity3 said some taxes would have to be raised , and the crowd applauded when he said he believes people with more money , like himself , ought to pay a heavier burden			2
" we 've got to get over this notion that we can have something for nothing , " @entity3 said			2
" that 's how we got into this deficit and this debt in the first place			0
" in reference to emotional and heated debate at some other town hall meetings across the country in recent weeks , @entity3 told @entity47 , " i appreciate your question , the respectful way you asked it , and by the way , i also believe in the @entity43			2
" afterward , @entity47 said he was impressed by @entity3 's performance but remained skeptical			2
" i do n't think he knows where that money 's going to come from , " he said			0
" if he does , he 's not saying			0
" @entity3 noted there is more work to be done , with @entity109 seeking to merge at least four bills , along with a possible compromise agreement being negotiated by @entity13 sen. @entity112 and five other members of his @entity114 , into a single bill in september			2
another questioner chosen when @entity3 asked for a skeptic identified himself as an insurance provider who wanted to know why @entity3 and @entity13 are vilifying the insurance industry in the health care debate			1
earlier in the meeting , @entity3 described what he called discriminatory practices by insurance companies that dropped coverage of people who became sick or refused to cover those with pre-existing medical conditions			1
@entity3 noted some insurance companies are contributing to the reform debate , but said others are spending millions of dollars to try to defeat any health care legislation			1
for a health care overhaul to work for everyone , he said , it has to ensure all @entity138 are covered so that insurance companies have incentive to participate			1
they wo n't be able to exclude coverage for pre-existing conditions or " cherry pick " healthy people while refusing coverage for sick people , @entity3 said , so increasing the total numbers covered will be the enticement			1
on saturday , @entity3 will hold another town hall meeting in @entity151 , @entity152 , before vacationing in some national parks with his family next week			1
in addition , @entity14 spokesman @entity155 said @entity3 will hold " some events not yet announced " in coming days			2
while @entity3 has said consensus can be reached on health care reform , contentious town hall meetings held by lawmakers around the country have created a different impression			1
the @entity14 , and many democrats in @entity109 , hope that by building support in the @entity167 , the president can start to turn the tide			0
though the region is largely @entity170 , @entity3 made some inroads in the latest election			2
he won in @entity152 and lost by just a slim margin in @entity1			0
however , @entity19 's comments in @entity175 , @entity20 , to @entity2 affiliate @entity176 signaled continuing divisions among @entity14 @entity13 over the scope and pace of health care legislation			1
" we said to the speaker [ house speaker @entity183 ] , the leadership , let 's not rush this thing , " @entity19 said			0
" let 's do it right , so we 'll have a uniquely @entity138 plan , if the thing passes			0
" @entity3 's town hall events are just part of a larger @entity13 strategy for winning support in the region			0
the @entity196 began a tv ad this week promoting the president 's health care plan			1
a committee spokesman said the ad will run on national cable as well as on local cable in @entity205 , @entity1 , @entity152 and the @entity206			0
the group @entity207 , which supports the president 's plan , also launched a campaign thursday that includes an ad running in a dozen states -- among them @entity1 and @entity152			2
but groups opposed to the president 's plan have their own campaigns			0
one voter in @entity220 , @entity1 , not far from where the president spoke in @entity0 , summarized the kinds of concerns that she and many others in the region have			0
" i believe that there is a health care crisis , i really do , " @entity228 , who voted for @entity3 in 2008 , told @entity2 's @entity225 on thursday			1
" do i believe that the government needs to be more involved ? no ! " @entity225 met @entity228 at a clinic that gets half its funding from taxpayers			0
" the government being involved is fine , " @entity228 said			0
" it 's just ... when they try and overstep , when they try to say , ' no , this is what needs to be done			0
