-- the @entity1 appear to think @entity2 has the answer to their latest conundrum : how to sidestep growing calls for extending unemployment benefits for the 1.3 million @entity7 who depend on them without looking like uncompassionate conservatives			1
a measure to renew @entity11 died in this @entity12 last week and it 's unclear , given that @entity14 must now focus on a spending bill , when senators will revisit the bill			2
last year , @entity2 's jobless rate fell to a five - year low after gov. @entity20 and the @entity1 - controlled legislature slashed unemployment benefits			1
the reason for this , wrote @entity24 , a former economist for the @entity26 administration , is that unemployment is " intricately linked to the length of unemployment benefits			1
" " if the unemployed have a source of income , " she wrote in @entity29 , " they are more likely to turn down lower - paying jobs -- even though they are losing job skills by remaining out of the labor force			1
the longer the unemployed are out of work , the more their skills atrophy			2
it is a vicious cycle leading to more long - term unemployment , a characteristic of this recession			2
" this formulation achieves two things			0
one , it provides an economic rationale for resisting benefit extension : jobless insurance discourages people from taking available work			1
two , it provides a moral rationale : discontinuing jobless insurance is the right thing to do			0
as @entity7 sen. @entity63 , @entity64 , noted in the @entity65 : " you could argue that conservatives who argue for shorter unemployment benefits actually have more concern for the worker than liberals who believe in no limits			1
conservatives want to get every able - bodied person back into the work force			0
" while there 's little doubt that @entity63 wants " every able - bodied person back in the work force , " there is ample reason to believe he and others have it upside down and backward			0
jobless insurance is n't a cause of unemployment			1
that 's caused by an economy that , on its own , would take more than seven years , by one estimate , to return to pre- 2008 levels			0
what 's more , @entity63 's clumsy attempt to retake the moral high ground reflects another puzzle that no @entity1 or @entity87 has thus far faced : how can we continue to promote the values of freedom , hard work and self - reliance when even a full - time job is n't enough to get by ? there 's one aspect that @entity96 omits , and it 's a whopper			1
indeed , as she noted , some overqualified people surely settled for low - wage , no - benefit jobs after @entity97 cut their jobless insurance			1
but the more important reason why @entity2 's unemployment rate went down is plain to see : people stopped looking for work			1
more precisely , they stopped being counted			0
according to the @entity109 's most recent jobs report , the @entity7 economy added far fewer jobs than expected ( 74,000 compared to 200,000 ) but the unemployment rate fell			1
why ? because of something called the " participation rate			0
" that 's the @entity115 's best guess measure of the number of those who are currently working and those who are looking for work			0
december saw the lowest participation rate in four decades			0
a low employment rate may be good for politics ( making the rounds is an impressive graph depicting a thin blue line dramatically falling over the course of president @entity128 's time in office )			2
but a low participation rate is bad for the economy and for everyone			0
it suggests an array of social ills , like millions of educated young people who ca n't get their lives started			0
but it also comes at a time when in @entity140 the need for balanced budgets trumps the need for jobs , and when all the tools used to counteract the panic of 2008 -- including " the stimulus , " food stamps , unemployment benefits and the @entity151 's monthly infusion of $ 80 billion -- have expired or are expiring			1
this year may reveal just how bad the real economy is			0
the @entity1 no doubt fear that if they agree to an extension of unemployment benefits , or compromise on any safety net program , that they wo n't get the credit			1
and unlike the @entity158 , who would be rewarded in this year 's midterm elections , the @entity1 would be punished by voters who believe welfare is , as one congressman put it , " legalized plunder			1
" such is the price for politicizing formerly nonpartisan economic issues			0
but the @entity1 face a philosophical conundrum as well as a political one			2
as senator @entity63 noted : " the @entity1 has always proposed ideas of less government and more freedom			2
" but if the economy on its own is incapable of creating the 7.4 million jobs needed to return to " normal , " what does such a formulation mean ? in terms of the long - term unemployed , it means less government equals less freedom , a lot less			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			2

@entity184 : @entity1 uses @entity2 's lowered jobless rate in unemployment debate
he says rate fell after benefits slashed . @entity1 argues benefits make people turn down jobs
this gives @entity1 cover for not extending jobless benefits , he says . but it masks economic reality
@entity184 : @entity2 rate reflects people no longer looking for jobs . where is @entity1 's solution ?
