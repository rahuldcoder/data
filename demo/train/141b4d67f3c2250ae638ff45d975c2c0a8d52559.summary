lawyers for @entity2 bombing suspect @entity1 accused the government of imposing unduly harsh restrictions on their client in a motion filed wednesday			1
@entity1 is " in near total isolation , " is banned from praying with other inmates and is allowed out of his cell only to meet with lawyers or spend short periods in an outdoor enclosure , court documents said			1
@entity15 @entity14 attorney @entity14 asked the attorney general for these special administrative measures after @entity1 had been in prison for four months			1
@entity19 said the restrictions are necessary as part of what prosecutors call @entity1 's " continued desire to incite others to engage in violent jihad , " according to the august memorandum included in the court filing			1
@entity30 's in - laws answer questions from grand jury as evidence , prosecutors cite the 1,000 " unsolicited " letters the 19 - year - old @entity37 - born @entity36 has received during his five - month incarceration			1
his lawyers say he has not responded to any of them			0
@entity1 has been at the @entity41 prison facility an hour outside @entity42 after a brief hospitalization for wounds incurred during his capture on april 19			2

" documents detail suspect 's injuries his lawyers also said @entity1 has done nothing during his incarceration to warrant such restrictions or to suggest he is dangerous , nor is there evidence the attack was " directed by others still at large or that mr. @entity1 ever had operational authority to direct the activities of others " to whom he may want to communicate			1
