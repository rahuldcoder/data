-- a freight train went off the rails outside @entity3 , @entity4 , in the last week of december , spilling a load of crude oil and creating an impressive explosion that prompted officials to evacuate the small town			1
no one was hurt , but cell phone videos of the fireball were given wide exposure in the media			2
here was " an airborne toxic event , " a phrase @entity17 famously used in his novel " @entity19 , " a theatrical catastrophe born of the most quintessential @entity22 screw - up : a railroad crash			1
in addition to its use as shorthand for a failed government initiative or a friend who really ought to quit drinking , train wrecks occupy a contradictory place in the @entity22 cultural memory			1
they are as much celebrated as they are feared , and frequently memorialized in art and song			0
one of the most celebrated martyrs in @entity22 history , for example -- @entity41 -- lost his life while trying to limit casualties in a 1900 smash - up on the @entity45			2
but beneath the morbid romanticism lies a historical home truth about train wrecks -- it took a little while before the most spectacular and shocking of them resulted in enough popular outrage to spur by real legislative action to make the rails safer			1
and so today an incident such as @entity3 draws attention , with the help of dramatic tv images , to the enormous amount of oil being shipped on @entity22 rails and the inadequacy of current tank - car designs			1
it was different before mass media , and not every crash was galvanizing			2
wrecks were all too common on early @entity22 rails , mainly because the tracks were constructed so badly			1
the merchant barons of @entity70 and @entity71 were in a rush to get their lines over the @entity74 and into the fertile grain country of the @entity76 during the 1830s			0
crews grew accustomed to laying warped wooden ties and low - quality iron , and breakneck curves were common in the mountains			0
signaling was also primitive , which meant that collisions -- euphemistically called " cornfield meets " -- were another cost of doing business			0
perhaps because they involved an exciting new technology -- the railroad was the first true " machine " of the steam era to see widespread use -- or perhaps because the crashes were so messy and difficult to clean up ( a combination of jacks , ramps and pulleys were often necessary to rerail cars ) , train wrecks came to assume a mythic stature and even a nobility that a later generation of car and plane mishaps would never touch			0
when engineer @entity41 hit the brakes on his speeding @entity45 locomotive instead of jumping in 1900 , he died in the crash but became the subject of an enormously popular ballad and an oral legend that he died with the throttle puncturing his heart and a halo of spilled corn around his head			0
songs such as " @entity118 " and " @entity119 " became beloved standards			0
there were no stirring ballads to be drawn out of a horrendous train caught fire in @entity125 , @entity126 , in 1867 that burned 49 people to death			0
the result was that carriages would no longer be made of wood and track gauges were standardized throughout the country , a turning point for cars and rails			2
and in @entity126 's @entity138 was torn up and @entity139 was completely rebuilt after a wreck in the tunnels killed 15 people in 1902			0
the @entity143 installed automatic speed control on its system after a crash near @entity147 , in @entity148 , in 1950 killed 78 commuters and triggered the threat of a boycott by frightened @entity153 riders			0
and @entity155 's @entity154 began an accelerated program to install a gps - based safety system called positive train control after a 2008 wreck in which the driver blew through a stop signal because he was texting on his phone			2
likewise , the deadly crash of a @entity165 train north of @entity126 in december has raised the urgency of a 2015 federal deadline for railroads to install positive train control			0
wrecks have so fascinated and horrified the public since the early days of train travel that perhaps it is no surprise that @entity22 's first corporate public relations department was created by the @entity174 after one of its trains plunged into a creek near @entity179 in 1906 , killing 53 passengers			1
last week 's derailment in @entity4 has already raised questions about just how much oil is now being shipped by rail in @entity22			1
the answer : a lot			0
almost all of @entity4 's considerable production of oil is shipped by rail , and train cars carrying petroleum went from about 10,000 in 2009 to an estimated 400,000 by the end of this year			1
this signals a revival of a hauling practice not widely used since the 1860s , and has spurred calls to toughen federal design standards for the @entity201 - 111 type of tank car that is most often used to transport oil			1
unlike other transforming rail crashes in @entity22 history , nobody died or was even hurt in the @entity3 incident			1
it would be a major step forward -- perhaps even worthy of myth -- if this bloodless wreck on the prairie is what it took to bring us better oil cars on @entity22 tracks			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity220 .			2

@entity220 : oil freighter went off rails in @entity4 ; fireball made arresting media image
@entity22 have a *perverse* , *folkloric* fascination with wrecks in song and story
he says deaths and media *coverage* have helped make wrecks spur *reform*
@entity220 : let 's hope @entity4 crash spurs *higher* safety in rail transport of oil
