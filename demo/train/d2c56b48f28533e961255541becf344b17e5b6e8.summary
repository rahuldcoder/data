a lot of my favorite memories are associated with its sweet taste			2
as i matured , my taste changed to @entity23 and , more recently , @entity24			2
i enjoyed starting my day with a @entity24 before the first period class arrived			2
it was part of my relaxation routine -- a comfort drink , so to speak			2
the taste , the sound , the " fizz			2
" i would tell people , " i need my caffeine			2

but it was n't a habit i wanted my two teenage girls starting up			0
i wanted to be a better role model			0
my words do n't hold much value if i am drinking what i tell them that they can not , i thought			0
