@entity0 -- @entity3 's @entity2 sent a secret message to president @entity5 in 1970 pleading with him to attack @entity6 , according to declassified documents released wednesday by the former president 's library			1
president @entity5 works at his desk in the @entity12 in a june 1972 photograph			0
the papers are among about 10,000 documents released by the @entity16 , some of which offer harbingers of present - day events , such as concerns about terrorism and @entity22			1
library director @entity23 said the documents describe challenges such as how to get the @entity22 more involved in solving the @entity28 - @entity27 conflict , how to get them more engaged against terrorism , how to address the @entity32 view that the @entity33 always sides with @entity27 and how to build up moderate @entity28 to counter extremists			1
a 1973 diplomatic cable cites this objective : " isolate and undermine terrorisms [ sic ] and commandos [ sic ] by establishing another , more stable and respectable @entity28 political entity and political personality			0
" documents detail @entity33 efforts to persuade @entity22 to move away from @entity42 , the military wing of the @entity44 , because @entity33 officials believed the @entity44 was supporting the terrorist - linked , anti-israel group @entity46 , referred to as @entity47			1
the document , a @entity50 telegram from the embassy in @entity52 to @entity0 reads , " @entity47 and @entity42 [ are ] now linked together in vicious effort to create chaos and uncertainty			2
one might wonder whether central objective @entity47 conspiracy was not to erase any slight progress toward @entity61 peace			0
" the document release was intended to coincide with @entity61 peace summit among @entity28 , @entity27 and other @entity61 leaders in @entity65 , @entity23 said			2
the @entity66 also was adjusting to @entity27 's acquisition of a nuclear weapon			1
" we are declassifying the records today that laid the basis for @entity5 's decision in 1969 to accept the fact , a fact of life , that @entity27 had a bomb , a nuclear device , " said @entity23			1
" that , of course , is very important with what 's going on in @entity81			0
" " even though it is clear from the documents that the @entity33 government did not encourage @entity27 to acquire a nuclear deterrent , it became a fact of life , " @entity23 said			1
" there are materials here that show how our government , 30 years ago , dealt with this very , very difficult problem			0
" rather than openly declare itself as a nuclear power , @entity27 still maintains a strategic ambiguity over its nuclear weapons capability			2
in 1970 , as @entity2 dealt with threats by both @entity28 refugees in his country and @entity6 military forces crossing @entity3 's border , the king asked " the @entity33 and @entity106 to intervene in the war in @entity3 , asking the @entity33 , in fact , to attack @entity6 , " @entity23 said			1
" @entity6 had invaded @entity3 and the @entity3 king , facing what he felt was a military rout , said please help us in any way possible			2
" the telegram indicates that @entity2 himself called a @entity33 official at 3 a.m. to ask for @entity33 or @entity118 help			1
" situation deteriorating dangerously following @entity6 massive invasion ... , " the document said			2
" i request immediate physical intervention both land and air ... to safeguard sovereignty , territorial integrity and independence of @entity3			0
immediate air strikes on invading forces from any quarter plus air cover are imperative			0
" the library has withheld the @entity5 documents from public access until wednesday and have been reviewed for release and / or declassified , @entity23 said			0
@entity5 served as president from january 20 , 1969 , to august 9 , 1974 , when he resigned under political pressure during the @entity138 -- the only @entity33 president to do so			0
he died in 1994 after suffering a stroke at the age of 81			0
