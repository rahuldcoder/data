-- @entity1 has defended himself from criticism by @entity3 following sunday 's @entity5 derby , in which the @entity7 striker scored two goals but appeared to play a role in @entity11 's captain being sent off			1
city manager @entity3 has officially appealed against @entity13 's decision to dismiss @entity14 in the 12th minute of the 3 - 2 home defeat that ended his side 's @entity17 title defense at the first hurdle , and blamed @entity1 for influencing the referee			1
@entity14 slid in with two feet to win the ball off @entity7 winger @entity22 , who did not appeal for a foul -- but @entity1 ran straight to the official and @entity13 ruled that it was a dangerous tackle			1
" it was not a red card			1
@entity1 told him his decision , " @entity3 told reporters after the match , before referring to an incident last week when he gesticulated from the touchline to have an opposing player punished			2
" when i did this against @entity37 , people told me not to do it			0
i said i was sorry and made a mistake			0
" who are football 's top january transfer targets ? @entity1 , however , insisted on his @entity43 account that he had done no wrong			0
" funny how people think i got kompany sent off			0
im not ref. i did n't give red card			2
but it was a clear red card			2
2 footed tackle , " he wrote on the social networking website on monday			0
@entity7 boss @entity54 agreed with @entity1 that @entity14 deserved to be sent off			2
" i think so , i 've seen him do it before -- he maybe got off in the past			0
i think if he catches @entity22 then he 's got a problem			0
" @entity58 in shock return as @entity7 beat @entity17 holders @entity11 @entity11 's appeal will be heard ahead of wednesday 's first leg of the @entity64 semifinal against @entity37			1
if it fails , @entity14 will miss that home match , the second leg and @entity69 games against @entity70 and third - placed @entity71 due to it being his second red card this season			1
his absence would be a blow to @entity11 's hopes of winning a first league title since 1968 , with the league leaders already lacking central defensive cover as @entity80 is away at the @entity81 along with his brother , key midfielder @entity82			1
that could mean a recall for 21 - year - old @entity85 , who is on loan at @entity69 strugglers @entity87 , or @entity88 -- who had been expected to leave in the january transfer window as @entity3 seeks to free up funds to make new signings .			0
