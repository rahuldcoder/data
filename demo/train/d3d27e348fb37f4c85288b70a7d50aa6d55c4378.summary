@entity1 , @entity2 @entity0 is the man of the moment , the poster child of @entity2 's new left , the firebrand leader of anti-austerity party @entity5			1
in his fine suits , he cuts a dashing figure , and at 40 , he 's considered young to be a political leader			1
but for many on the streets of @entity1 it 's his words that matter -- his promise of " no more bailouts , no more submission , no more blackmailing			2
" it 's a message of hope that resonates with those across this country , hardened by years of the @entity22 's bitter medicine : austerity			2
@entity2 was among the nations hardest - hit by the global financial crisis ; a deeply - troubled economy , widespread unemployment and civil unrest meant that back in 2010 the country was teetering on the brink of exit from the euro , labeled the sick man of @entity33			1
but the prescription handed down by the @entity35 -- the @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 -- was always going to be difficult to swallow : tax hikes , a freeze on state pensions , bans on early retirement and deep cuts in government salaries , in return for a € 240 billion bailout			2
five years on and the @entity2 economy is starting to recover			1
last year , it came out of recession ; this year the country 's gdp is expected to grow 0.7 %			2
but some fear the years spent locked in a straitjacket of debt and stagnation may have done more harm than good			2
there is widespread unemployment , with 27 % of the population out of work , industrial production has shrunk 30 % and three million people live on or below the poverty line			2
for many here , austerity has only led to hardship , and caused unbearable strains that are visible on faces across the city			2
over instant coffee at his house on the outskirts of @entity1 , @entity74 , 58 , says his world has been turned upside down since losing his job in 2009			2
he has been unemployed ever since			2
" i used to have money in my pocket , and now , i have nothing , " he explains			0
" i was supposed to get my pension next year and now that has been pushed back by two years			0
just put yourself in my position			0
" the initial frustration he felt has turned to anger			0
his pride has also been battered ; to get by , he has had to ask his mother to share her pension -- not easy for a man who had always been the breadwinner			0
now , he and his four grown - up sons depend on his wife @entity96			1
but her wages , which have been slashed by 55 % , are not enough to feed everyone , leaving her with a tough decision : help the family or pay taxes			0
" who to help first ? they are four			0
i do n't buy anything for myself so that i can help them			0
i had to pay € 260 in taxes , and i only earn € 800			0
so i have n't paid the taxes and gave the money to my son to help him with his rent , " she explains			0
the family 's desperation has only been exacerbated by their disenchantment with politicians and their policies : since 2005 , @entity2 has had six prime ministers , each one vowing to bring an end to the crisis ; each one promising jobs and growth			1
but nothing , @entity74 says , has changed			0
so , he and his wife are gambling on @entity2 's left - wing @entity5 party , their pledge to bring an end to austerity , and their message that " hope is coming "			1
angry and frustrated , @entity74 insists : " things ca n't get any worse with a new government			0
and if they do , we 'll vote again for someone else			0
" have politicians ever asked an unemployed citizen when he wakes up in the morning and who has a family , if this person has a single euro , or € 5 , in his pocket to buy a carton of milk to feed his children ? " he asks			0
" i do n't trust any of them			0
" for now , @entity74 and @entity96 are placing their trust in @entity5 and its leader @entity0 , who has promised to raise the minimum wage , re-hire public sector workers , reduce taxes and tackle the country 's " silent humanitarian crisis "			1
but @entity0 's boldest pledge -- and the one that is making the rest of @entity33 nervous -- is his promise to renegotiate the terms of the @entity2 bailout deal			1
at @entity5 's last rally before sunday 's general election , i asked the party 's finance spokesman @entity165 what they will do if they ca n't see eye - to - eye with @entity33			1
" what we are arguing [ for ] with our @entity33 partners is a new arrangement that will remove part of the public debt burden on the @entity2 economy and at the same time allow @entity2 to get back to work , " he says			1
in other words , they want to stay in the single currency but with more fiscal leeway -- a breathing space of sorts , so the country can recover from its " economic coma , " and begin to grow again			0
both working - class and middle - class voters -- and both public and private sector workers -- have voiced support for this call			1
computer developer @entity192 says he has always voted for the conservatives , but having seen his wages slashed and his taxes increase -- and as the father of a newborn baby , he 's voting for change this time around			0
" @entity5 does n't express 100 % my opinions and i 'm not level with what they believe and what they want to do , but i believe its something new , a new party with fresh ideas that is going to change what is already rotten , " he explains			1
there is no doubt that anger and austerity have fueled the rise of @entity5 in a country whose citizens are calling for social and economic change			1
but -- if he is elected -- the question of whether @entity0 can make a difference to @entity2 will depend on what he does with his power , and how the @entity22 and its leaders deal with him			1
whatever the outcome of sunday 's polls , the hard work , it seems , is just beginning .			1

@entity2 voters went to the polls on sunday in a snap election
@entity0 , leader of the left - wing anti-austerity @entity5 party , *declared* *victory* for his party
since 2005 , @entity2 has had six prime ministers , each one promising to bring an end to crisis
