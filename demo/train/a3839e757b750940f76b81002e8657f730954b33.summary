@entity0 , @entity1 -- the pictures may be difficult to look at , but 18 - month - old @entity5 's story of survival is remarkable			1
soon after she was born in a remote village in northeastern @entity1 , @entity5 was diagnosed with an extreme form of hydrocephalus -- a disorder causing cerebral fluid to build up in the brain			1
doctors had given @entity5 just a few months to live			1
" day - by - day , her head started growing bigger , she stopped wanting to eat , she would just lie in bed , it became very difficult for us to carry her and take her anywhere , " says @entity5 's father @entity14 says			1
@entity5 's head grew to a circumference of 94 centimeters , almost triple the size of a normal baby			1
there were ten liters of excess fluid inside her brain			2
her head was so heavy she could barely move			0
hydrocephalus is more common among infants and older adults			0
the condition is caused by overproduction , obstruction or lack of absorption of the cerebral fluid in the brain			1
the skin of her head has stretched so far , it pulled her eyelids over her eyes , making it impossible for @entity5 to see			1
her mother , @entity43 , would draw eyebrows on @entity45 with black kohl everyday just to try and make her look more normal			0
" she had such a big head , it was scary for people to see her , " @entity43 explains			0
@entity5 may be @entity14 and @entity43 's only child , but they could n't afford to treat her			2
@entity5 's 18 - year - old father works at a brick kiln earning less than $ 3 a day			1
for more than a year and a half , they took care of @entity5 in their two - room mud hut , with little knowledge or means of doing much else			2
in april this year , a journalist took photos of @entity5 and soon people all over the world including two @entity66 students @entity64 and @entity67 were moved by her condition			1
@entity64 and @entity67 put @entity5 's photo on a crowd funding website , hoping to raise $ 1,600 to cover her shunt surgery			1
in two months , they raised double that amount , and by august 2013 , they raised more than $ 60,000			1
they 've transferred half of this amount to the charity arm of @entity79 in @entity80 for her treatment			0
the hospital covered the remaining half of the expenses			0
the students plan to send the remaining amount for @entity5 's aftercare			1
when @entity5 arrived at @entity79 , her condition shocked even chief neurosurgeon @entity88 , who has treated hundreds of children with hydrocephalus			1
" we had never seen anything like that and we were completely clueless as to how we 'd go about treating her			0
there was no precedent of treating a child with such an extreme case of hydrocephalus			2
we learned as we went , " @entity88 says			0
initially , @entity88 was n't hopeful about the surgery			0
@entity5 was malnourished , she had major infections on the back of her head from the pressure of lying down all day , and her skin was very thin and delicate			1
cerebral shunt is the standard treatment for hydrocephalus			2
it 's a simple procedure which involves inserting a drainage tube to keep the fluids flowing at the proper rate			0
but due to the size of @entity5 's head and her small , frail body , @entity5 's treatment was particularly challenging			1
@entity88 says the surgery posed a huge risk to her life , and at one point they almost lost her			0
much to the relief of her parents and her doctors , @entity5 has pulled through			2
after five surgeries , @entity5 's head is now down to a circumference of 58 centimeters , still larger than the average 38 to 48 centimeters , but small enough to allow her to live a reasonably normal life			1
she constantly moves her head around , she is playful and most importantly , she can now see			0
she is finally getting the chance to be the baby she really is			0
" it feels really good to see her now , she looks beautiful and happy , " @entity43 says			0
back in her village , @entity5 has become the center of attention			2
it 's still painful for her to sit up but she smiles a lot , and her eyes , now visible , keep wandering in a frenzied pace			0
" we want @entity5 to read and write once she grows up			2
both of us ( mother and father ) are illiterate so we do n't want her to be like us			0
we want her to have a bright future , " @entity43 says			0
it 's too early to tell if @entity5 will ever be completely normal in her appearance as several operations still lie ahead , but the signs thus far are promising .			2

just 18 months old , @entity5 has had *multiple* surgeries for extreme hydrocephalus
her head tripled in size from due to a build up of cerebral fluid soon after birth
she had been given months to live , but *underwent* surgery funded by *donations*
two @entity66 students heard of her *plight* and raised $ 60,000 for surgery
