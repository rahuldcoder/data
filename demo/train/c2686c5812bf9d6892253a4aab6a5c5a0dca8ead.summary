in a letter to secretary of state @entity10 obtained by @entity1 , deputy chief of mission @entity7 said he had " no choice " but to leave his post in protest over human rights abuses and fraudulent elections			1
he said he is formally seeking asylum for himself and his family because he is afraid for their lives			0
@entity21 spokeswoman @entity20 confirmed the @entity21 received a letter but declined to comment further about private diplomatic correspondence			2
win 's move is a setback for the regime in @entity4 , which held its first elections in 20 years in november			2
the vote drew fire from critics who said it was aimed at creating a facade of democracy			1
the regime had refused to allow international monitors or journalists into @entity4 for the vote but has argued the elections constitute an end to military rule and merit an easing of international sanctions			0
@entity7 wrote in the letter he had held out hope for democratic reforms throughout his 31 - year career , but lost confidence after last year 's widely criticized elections , which largely left the military junta in control			1
as such , he said , he could not in good conscience continue working for the government			0
" the truth is that senior military officials are consolidating their grip on power and seeking to stamp out the voices of those seeking democracy , human rights and individual liberties			2
oppression is rising and war against our ethnic cousins is imminent , " he wrote			0
as a high - ranking diplomat , @entity7 maintained ties with pro-democracy @entity4 activists in @entity0			1
in the letter he talked about the balance he had to strike between reaching out to the opposition and answering to his government			0
he also urged the @entity6 to set up an international council of inquiry to investigate human rights violations in @entity4 and calls for the @entity6 to implement targeted sanctions against the government and its " cronies that serve to keep them in power			1
" he said he fears returning to the country because his efforts to improve bilateral relations with the @entity6 have been continually rejected and " resulted in my being deemed dangerous by the government			2
" win also warned about threats made to pro-democracy leader and @entity86 laureate @entity84 , who traveled outside @entity87 this week for the first time since she was freed from house arrest last november			1

in his letter , @entity7 mentions @entity84 's travel , warning the threats against her " must be taken seriously			1
" the @entity107 administration has shifted from a longtime policy of isolation of @entity4 in favor of engagement , with little success			0
last week @entity113 , the nominee to be @entity6 special envoy to @entity4 , said the @entity6 is prepared to have a positive relationship with the country and would seek better international coordination in encouraging democratic reform there			2
@entity113 was critical of the regime 's claims to have made a transition to civilian rule after last year 's elections , saying at his @entity126 confirmation hearing that " @entity4 remains a country at war with itself and distrustful of others			0
