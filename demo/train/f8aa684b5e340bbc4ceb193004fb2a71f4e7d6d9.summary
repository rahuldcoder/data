@entity0 , @entity1 -- when is wearing a t - shirt with the @entity5 flag on it considered provocative ? answer : when you wear it to a high school with a dress code that explicitly prohibits " any clothing or decoration which detracts from the learning environment			1
" and when the high school , where 20 % of the 1,300 students are @entity16 - language learners and 18 % come from low - income families , has been described by the @entity18 as having " an ethnically charged atmosphere			1
" and when , despite concerns about potential violence , you and some of your friends make your patriotic wardrobe choices on , of all days , @entity24			0
last week , chief @entity26 @entity25 said as much when he dismissed a lawsuit by a group of students and their parents against the @entity32 in @entity1			1
the plaintiffs had alleged that , on may 5 , 2010 , the students ' rights to freedom of speech were violated when @entity38 assistant principal @entity37 ordered them to remove or turn inside out t - shirts bearing the @entity5 flag			1
the students refused , and two of them were sent home			2
under ordinary circumstances , wearing a t - shirt with the @entity5 flag on it would probably not be a big deal			1
but this high school is no ordinary place , especially not on @entity24			0
it 's a cultural powder keg			0
the previous year , in 2009 , a group of @entity54 students marked the holiday by walking around campus holding a @entity54 flag			1
a group of white students responded by hanging a makeshift @entity5 flag from a tree and chanting " @entity5			1
" according to the @entity18 , tensions flared and the two groups faced off with profanity and threats			0
little wonder that when some students showed up at school wearing t - shirts with @entity5 flags on them administrators decided to err on the side of caution			1
meanwhile , the judge did the right thing in dismissing the case and declaring that administrators had the right to take preventive action if there was a " reasonable fear " of violence			2
score one for common sense			1
can you imagine where we 'd be if the court had gone the other way and stripped school officials of the power to maintain order ? it 's easy for conservative radio talk show hosts and other right - wing commentators to criticize the administrators , but they were n't there			1
they 're speaking from ignorance			0
they do n't have even the most basic understanding of the mood at the high school or the events of previous years			0
for the last four decades , they have chipped away at the idea that students ' free speech rights should trump every other consideration			0
the @entity110 established those rights in 1969 in a case called @entity113			0
in that case , a group of high school and junior high school students were suspended when they wore black armbands to protest the @entity119			1
the high court declared that students do n't " shed their constitutional rights to free speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate			0
" but since @entity113 , and at the urging of conservatives , the @entity110 has curtailed first amendment rights of students , especially when the expression of those rights is disruptive , obscene or might lead to violence			0
it did so in three other cases : @entity135 ( 1986 ) , in which the high court held that a high school student 's speech during an assembly -- filled with sexual innuendo -- was not protected ; @entity142 ( 1988 ) , in which the justices held that schools can regulate the content of student newspapers ; and @entity148 ( 2007 ) , in which the @entity110 held that school officials can restrict student speech at a school - supervised event even if it takes place off - campus			1
that 's the new legal reality , and it 's one that conservatives helped create			0
now they have to live with it			0
the other problem is the parents , who did their offspring no favors by encouraging them to play the victim and call a lawyer			2
they were so eager to sue and teach their kids to stand up for their rights that they neglected to teach them that , in our system , rights come with responsibilities			2
like this one : @entity5 have the responsibility to treat one another , and one another 's cultures , with respect			1
just because someone shows cultural pride -- @entity182 , anyone ? -- does n't mean it 's an expression of @entity185			0
@entity5 is all about coming together as one , while preserving the cultural attributes that make us unique			2
there 's the rub : the students who brought the lawsuit against school officials claim to be proud of the @entity5 flag			1
but it 's obvious they do n't have the foggiest idea what it represents			0
and , when they had the chance , their parents failed to teach them			2
follow @entity204 on @entity205 for more views on the news the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210			2

@entity210 : students wore flag t - shirts to provoke @entity54 - @entity5 students
@entity210 : principal asked them to remove shirts , and they and their parents sued
showing common sense , he says , a judge dismissed the case , ruling in school 's favor
@entity210 : parents taught kids to play the victim , failed to teach them respect for others
