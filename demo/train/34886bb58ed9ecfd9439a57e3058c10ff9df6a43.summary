-- on his @entity3 talk show , " @entity8 , " comedian @entity1 aired a blistering segment about president @entity5 and the issue of income inequality			1
@entity1 reminded viewers that " last december , the president made it clear that income inequality " would be a " big priority , " since in a speech he called it the " defining challenge of our time			1
" the segment continued with clips of media pundits saying that the battle against income inequality had finally begun and that an " all - out assault " on this problem was inevitable			2
@entity1 joked that income inequality had better watch out , since it was going to be " violently ameliorated " -- or , he explains , it would have been if @entity25 had not " immediately backed down			1
" instead of a war on inequality , he said , the issue became another topic that @entity30 like to avoid ( like @entity32 internment camps or the time we gave @entity34 an @entity35 )			1
@entity1 is on to something important			0
no matter how many times @entity25 bring up the issue , they just ca n't seem to commit to a fight on income inequality			1
inequality can be a winning issue such a retreat is not inevitable			1
the conventional argument that the @entity30 is just a center - right country does n't hold water			0
in most polls , there is clear evidence of strong support for policies that deal with inequality , such as a higher minimum wage or tax cuts that will stimulate job growth , as well as limits on the tax benefits enjoyed by companies that invest overseas			2
when asked whether they dislike government , @entity30 often say yes			0
but when asked about whether they like specific policies that combat inequality , they also respond favorably			2
whenever republicans have tried to take a big bite out of programs that create some kind of social safety net , like @entity68 , they have faced a huge backlash			1
just ask former president @entity70 , who watched his political capital burn away in 2005 when he attempted to privatize @entity68			1
the @entity25 have a strong party tradition during the @entity73 and @entity74 of making great electoral gains when they focus on these kinds of questions			1
to be sure , there are some democrats who have insisted on moving forward with this issue despite the perceived political risks			2
@entity84 sen. @entity83 has been extremely aggressive in tackling inequality			2
in a recent trip to @entity89 , @entity90 excited @entity25 when she told them to ask @entity63 , " who do you work for ? do you work for those who hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers ? do you work for the millionaires and billionaires who 've already made it big ? " early in his administration , president @entity5 was more determined to move forward with this issue , as was evident with the creation of the @entity101 and his advocacy of pay equity			1
hesitating on inequality issue yet it also true that @entity25 quickly get skittish when bringing up these issues			1
they have hesitated to make this a central issue for the party , and they have avoided going after republicans on the topic while branding themselves as the party that will help the middle class regain its mojo			2
since calling inequality the " defining issue of our time " in december , president @entity5 has consciously backed off even talking about the issue			1
in june , the @entity121 published a revealing piece documenting how he abandoned the issue despite his bold talk last year			2
he shifted from talking about the persistence of income inequality that results from our public policies and structure of our economy to a more optimistic trope of offering ways to boost the middle class			2
" both the @entity140 and the @entity141 agreed that the decline of middle - class incomes was the most serious issues we face in this country , " sen. @entity134 was quoted as saying in the story , " but the focus had to be on how to get middle - class incomes up , rather than drive other people 's incomes down			2
" even when policies are difficult to pass in @entity149 , at a minimum , a president has the power to keep talking about an issue and try to make it central in the national conversation			1
this is particularly important with controversial issues like inequality			2
yet he has decided not to use the power of the bully pulpit for this purpose			0
lacking self - confidence so why is this the case ? the most important is that @entity25 as a party lack self - confidence			1
ever since the 1970s , they have been a party that often thinks their opponents are winning , even when they are not , and for several decades they have accepted the terms for the debate laid out by the @entity63			1
in 1976 , @entity170 ran as a @entity171 who embraced conservative arguments about reforming bureaucracy and balancing the budget , someone who would challenge party stalwarts like organized labor			0
during his presidency , @entity178 , who ran as part of the centrist @entity180 , stressed the virtues of free markets and agreed to end the public welfare system that had been created in 1935			0
though @entity5 started his presidency with the promise to embrace progressive ideals , he has backed away from this kind of outlook and very often toed a centrist line			0
he has avoided any serious discussion of progressive tax reform that would raise more income from the wealthy , other than his decision to allow the tax cuts on the very wealthiest @entity30 to expire , or much tougher regulatory actions against @entity196 to prevent the kind of leakage that has been characteristic of the @entity200 - @entity199			0
the original law itself was written in a way that created huge openings for financial institutions to circumvent the regulations			0
there has been insufficient attention to public investment in new industries that could provide more well - paying jobs			0
@entity5 has maintained a tepid relation with unions , usually considered the best bulwark against inequality in the 20th century			0
strengthening the bargaining power of workers and protecting union members from fear of being fired has been a failed fight in recent years			0
@entity5 , and other presidents , have not stood by the unions			0
in short , @entity25 have been scared to embrace their own tradition			1
campaign dollars play a role @entity25 have also faced a loaded political process that does n't favor these kinds of policies			1
the existing campaign finance and lobbying system , which has greatly empowered corporate interests and wealthier @entity30 , makes it hard to actually fight for policies that reduce inequality			0
to run their campaigns , @entity25 need many millions of dollars from @entity196 and corporate interests that would oppose policies that significantly reduce inequality			1
democrats , including @entity5 , have generally given up on the issue of campaign finance and lobbying reform , and the playing field remains skewed against equality			0
when the financial crisis happened in 2008 , despite enormous public support for muscular regulatory policies , members of both parties backed down , in part a response to the power of @entity196			0
even today , @entity25 might talk about tougher tax policies toward corporations , but such changes are very hard to pass through @entity149 when they confront the corporate power in @entity257			1
@entity25 have not been very successful working with this issue in the modern media environment			1
@entity1 astutely plays clips of @entity262 broadcasts that followed @entity5 's speech on inequality , showing talking heads and hosts castigating the president for launching " class warfare			1
" the kinds of measures that have generally been discussed at this point , such as raising the minimum wage , are a far cry from class warfare			0
yet conservatives have been very effective at instantly spreading this message the minute the topic arises			0
@entity25 have not offered and sold an effective response , one that shows that dealing with economic security is not radical at all but very much part of the political tradition			1
a question for @entity283 when they downplay inequality as an issue , democrats are making a big political mistake			1
@entity283 , who is thinking of launching a presidential run , should know this better than anyone			0
her most powerful moments in the 2008 primaries came when she appealed to blue - collar @entity30 who were working hard and not getting ahead			0
this was the single issue that allowed her to light up on the campaign trail			0
with some skeptics saying that her ties to @entity196 will compromise her on this issue , @entity178 will need to push back -- as she did with a recent speech at the @entity304 -- and demonstrate that she is a @entity171 who will fight for strengthening the middle class			0
right now , @entity25 should probably take a close look at the agenda put forth by their colleagues in the @entity140			2
minority leader @entity309 proposed an agenda she would champion for the first 100 days in the unlikely event the @entity25 regain control of the @entity140 in november			2
it includes a minimum wage increase , equal pay legislation , cutting special tax breaks for corporations and more			0
these proposals are a step forward , though they clearly fall short of measures that will be able to truly reverse income inequality			0
for that , they will need presidential support and a party commitment to follow through			0
tackling inequality has always been a way for @entity25 to strengthen their political coalition of african - americans , blue - collar and middle - class workers and wealthier progressives			1
this is the issue that has always bound the party together			0
@entity25 have a huge opportunity to make gains , given the current agenda of the @entity63			1
despite all the talk of conservative populism , the fact is that @entity63 economic policies have been biased toward wealthier segments of the population			2
but if @entity25 are going to really move forward with these issues , they will have to avoid the mistakes that have bogged down these efforts in previous years			2
if they do n't change their ways , the @entity180 fight on income inequality will remain a punch line on comedy shows and a rallying cry for @entity63 who want to paint @entity25 as too far left of center			1
join us on @entity358 / @entity357 .			0

president called inequality the " defining challenge " of our time but has downplayed it since
@entity365 : @entity25 have been wary of making the issue their focus
he says @entity90 is right to emphasize it , and it could be a winning issue for @entity25
@entity365 : when @entity63 has targeted programs like @entity68 , it has suffered
