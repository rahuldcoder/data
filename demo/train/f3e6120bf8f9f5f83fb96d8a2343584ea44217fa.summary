-- tournament favorite @entity1 powered into the @entity4 women 's singles semifinals on tuesday , crushing @entity5 for the loss of just two games			1
fifth seed @entity1 , the 2004 champion and only grand slam winner left in the women 's draw , proved in a different league to @entity13 , taking just under an hour to reach the last four 6 - 1 6 - 1			1
@entity5 , seeded 24th , had stunned world number one @entity14 in the last 16 , but could not match that performance on @entity17 , as @entity18 reached the semifinals at the @entity20 for the first time since losing to @entity22 in 2006			2
the 24 - year - old @entity1 told reporters : " it 's an honor to be in the semifinal at @entity4			1
" it 's a few years since i 've got past the fourth round so it 's a great chance to take it a step further , " she added			0
" every opponent is different			0
i have a tough opponent coming up and i 'm looking forward to the match			0
" she 's confident and playing great grass court tennis , " continued @entity1 , who has yet to drop a set in the tournament so far			2
@entity1 's semifinal opponent is unseeded @entity38 @entity37 , who continued her remarkable run of form by defeating @entity41 of @entity42 in three sets			1
ninth seed @entity41 came into the tournament on a high after winning the warm - up event at @entity46 , and she maintained that momentum by putting out defending champion @entity48 in the last 16			1
however , wild card entrant @entity37 , who had beaten @entity51 champion @entity50 in an earlier round , proved far too strong in the decisive third set , going through 6 - 4 6 - 7 6 - 1 to become the first @entity38 woman to reach a grand slam semifinal since compatriot @entity56 in 1999			1
@entity58 @entity57 is also through to the semifinals after a battling three - set victory over @entity62 's @entity61			2
both players had reached the last four of last year 's tournament , losing to @entity48 and @entity66 respectively , and it was eighth seed @entity57 who got there again -- going through 6 - 3 6 - 7 6 - 2			0
@entity57 is aiming to become the first left - hander to win the women 's title since @entity74 in 1990			0
the final semifinal was held up because of heavy rain at @entity4 , and was eventually switched to @entity17 under the roof , where fourth seed @entity78 claimed a comfortable 6 - 3 6 - 1 victory over unseeded @entity82 @entity81			2
the 21 - year - old @entity83 had lost her four previous grand slam quarterfinals , but was never in danger against her unseeded opponent , who was reaching her first grand slam quarterfinal			0
@entity78 will now face @entity57 for a place in the final , in a repeat of their match here 12 months ago , which went the @entity58 's way .			0
