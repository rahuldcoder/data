-- early in her career , @entity1 specialized in playing hot - blooded schemers and even hotter - blooded seductresses			1
in films such as " hussy , " " @entity7 " and " @entity8 , the thief , his wife and her lover , " she combined the classic femme - fatale ingredients of smarts and sensuality into a molten cocktail of deliciously unpredictable danger			2
now , at 69 , @entity1 seems to have become typecast as stern snoots and blue - blooded battle - axes			1
what happened ? the obvious answer is that she got older in an industry that fetishizes youth , especially female youth			2
but i think there 's something else at work			1
i 'm convinced that @entity1 was so indelible as the tough - as - nails inspector @entity33 on the excellent @entity35 series " prime suspect " that most folks — including @entity32 casting directors — have had a difficult time seeing past the hard edges and frosty hauteur that come so effortlessly to her			1
@entity44 and @entity43 talk ' @entity41 ' @entity1 certainly starts off that way in " chocolat " director @entity46 's latest feel - good slice of food porn , " @entity50			1
" but one of the formulaic film 's few surprises is how the marvelous actress slowly blossoms from a stubborn prig into a romantic softy			1
for the first time in ages , she lets us see the frisky grin behind the scowl			2
based on @entity63 ' 2010 novel — and produced by @entity43 and the queen of spoon - fed sentimentality , @entity44 — " @entity50 " is a culture - clash confection about two rival restaurateurs competing for the hearts and taste buds of the same sleepy @entity71 village			1
on one side of the street is @entity74 , a @entity76 - starred temple to foie gras , pigeon with truffles , and other refined delicacies lorded over by @entity1 's condescending @entity81			1
on the other is @entity82 , an open - air bazaar of exotically earthy fare cooked with a sprinkle of turmeric and a heavy dose of love by the @entity90 family			2
@entity91 : @entity1 madame does everything she can to foil the newcomers from @entity95 , not because she 's a racist ( the film makes a point of her firing her xenophobic @entity71 chef ) but because their restaurant , with its roaming livestock and blaring bhangra music , offends her refined @entity104 sensibilities			1
'' who are zees people ? '' she asks with her nose in the air and a stick firmly lodged up her derriere			2
the battle unfolds with all the predictability of a train - station timetable			0
the @entity114 , headed by the widowed patriarch ( @entity116 ) and his soulful chef son , @entity117 ( @entity117 ) , awaken the parochial palates of the hamlet 's quirky residents			1
when @entity117 proves to be just as gifted at conjuring up a mouthwatering béchamel sauce as he is with tandoori goat , @entity121 wants him to help her win a second @entity76 star			0
( he also turns out to be a natural at wooing her sous chef , played by @entity127			2
) all of these by - the - numbers beats go down smoothly enough ( at least until a jarring third - act detour sends @entity117 to @entity130 )			0
it 's soothing , easily digested comfort food			0
which is to say it 's the perfect recipe for a filmmaker like @entity136			0
@entity137 : three of this season 's heartthrobs the director of " @entity151 " and " @entity152 " is a master at crafting a certain kind of well - appointed sap and manipulating audiences ' tear ducts ( i get a lump in my throat just thinking about his 2009 @entity148 sobfest , " @entity150 " )			0
but as talented as he is at eliciting pavlovian emotional responses with his middlebrow melodramas , he also makes you resent him as soon as you crumple and toss your @entity156			0
he rarely earns the catharsis he 's after			0
thankfully , here he has @entity1 and @entity116 as his sparring leads			1
i never entirely bought the flirty détente between the two or believed in the rapturous power of a perfectly cooked sea urchin to solve the world 's problems			0
but for two hours , at least , i swallowed it with a smile			0

" @entity50 " is based on the 2010 novel and directed by @entity46
it stars @entity1 as a @entity71 chef at war with the @entity95 restaurant across the street
eventually , the two competing restaurants learn to work together
the movie is formulaic , but *affecting*
