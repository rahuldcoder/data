@entity0 -- the @entity2 announced that it has concluded its investigation into the 2001 anthrax mailings , saying friday that a biodefense researcher carried out the attacks alone			1
the anthrax letters killed five people and sickened 17 shortly after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			1
the letters , filled with bacterial spores , were sent to @entity14 @entity13 leaders and news organizations			1
" by 2007 , investigators conclusively determined that a single spore - batch created and maintained by dr. @entity19 at the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) was the parent material for the letter spores , " said a report released friday by the @entity2			1
" evidence developed from that investigation established that dr. @entity19 , alone , mailed the anthrax letters			1
" there was no immediate response from @entity19 ' lawyer			1
@entity19 , 62 , committed suicide in july 2008 as federal agents were closing in on him , police said			1
in september and october 2001 , at least five envelopes were mailed to sen. @entity34 and then - sen. @entity35 , as well as to news organizations in @entity37 and in @entity38 , @entity39			0
each envelope contained a photocopy of a handwritten note			0
the five who died included two @entity0 postal workers , a @entity46 worker , a supermarket tabloid photo editor in @entity39 and a 94 - year - old woman in @entity49			0
the investigation into the anthrax mailings , code - named " @entity52 , " was one of the largest and most complex in the history of law enforcement , according to the @entity2			1
he had spent more than 30 years as a civilian microbiologist at the @entity60 's biological research laboratory at @entity61 , @entity62 , where he was trying to develop a better vaccine against anthrax			0
at the time of his death , @entity19 was under a temporary restraining order sought by a social worker who had counseled him in private and group sessions			1
he also had been hospitalized in the weeks leading up to his death for psychiatric examination after he threatened to kill co-workers , investigators " and other individuals who had wronged him , " according to documents released in the case			0
federal prosecutors named @entity19 the culprit in the anthrax attacks after his death			1
court records released by authorities showed that @entity19 was " the custodian of a large flask of highly purified anthrax spores that possess certain genetic mutations identical to the anthrax used in the attacks			1
" the government had taken steps in the weeks leading up to @entity19 ' death to restrict his access to his lab. but critics point out that then - attorney general @entity96 publicly declared another @entity61 scientist , @entity97 , a " person of interest " in the anthrax attacks			1
@entity97 was never charged but sued over the matter , settling with the government for $ 5.8 million			0
his case has fueled skepticism about the allegations against @entity19			2
in november 2008 the @entity105 @entity104 threw out @entity97 's libel lawsuit against the @entity107 over reports linking him to the anthrax probe			0
a federal appeals court had concluded @entity97 was a " public figure " and failed to prove the reports were " malicious			0
" in the report released on friday , the @entity2 said hatfill had been eliminated as a suspect			2
the report outlines the government 's evidence against @entity19 , saying that the researcher was alone late at night in the lab where the anthrax strain @entity120 was stored in the days leading up to the mailings			1
the lab also contained the equipment capable of drying the anthrax , a function that was forbidden , the report said			0
" dr. @entity19 was never in the habit of working excessive late night hours in the lab , either prior to or after the mailings , " it said			2
@entity19 was under " intense personal and professional pressure " in the months leading up to the anthrax attacks , the report said , citing the researchers ' e-mails and statements to friends			1
" the anthrax vaccine program to which he had devoted his entire career of more than 20 years was failing			0
the anthrax vaccines were receiving criticism in several scientific circles , because of both potency problems and allegations that the anthrax vaccine contributed to @entity147 , " it said			0
" short of some major breakthrough or intervention , he feared that the vaccine research program was going to be discontinued			0
following the anthrax attacks , however , his program was suddenly rejuvenated			2
" the report also said that @entity19 ' e-mails and statements show a " man driven by obsessions			2
" " in the month before his suicide , " it said , " his homicidal tendencies became more pronounced , as he posted violent messages on the @entity164 regarding a reality tv star and made death threats during a group therapy session			0
" it also says that @entity19 made several statements and actions that showed " evidence of a guilty conscience			2
" they included sending an e-mail to the @entity175 that suggested " nonsensical explanations for why the first victim might have contracted inhalation anthrax , " and repeatedly made efforts to shift the blame for the mailings to friends and colleagues			0
" at one point , he sent an e-mail to himself documenting 12 reasons why two of his former colleagues , who were also his two best friends , likely committed the anthrax attacks , " the report said .			2

biodefense researcher @entity19 acted alone , @entity2 says
