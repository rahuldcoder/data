while traditionally hotels offering " day rates " conjure up seedy , by - the - hour hovels reserved exclusively for illicit trysts , the last couple of years have seen a rash of upmarket accommodations adopting the practice			1
according to many in the hospitality industry , day - rate rooms are more likely to be used for business and tourism purposes than they are romantic ones			1
just behind world - famous department store @entity14 sits one of @entity18 's most exclusive hotels			1
the @entity19 may be the only accommodation in the city with unlimited complimentary cream tea and an open bar ( guests can guzzle all the champagne they can muster , free of charge )			1
it can afford these amenities because the room rates start at £ 170 ( $ 270 ) per night			2
" the @entity19 is actually a very exclusive boutique hotel , " explains @entity30 , the director of sales and marketing			1
" we cater to a unique set of people because our price bracket is such			0
it 's not just for any @entity37			0
" and it 's not the type of place you 'd expect would offer discounted day rates			1
yet it is one of hundreds of high - end hotels that have started doing so in the last year			1
@entity30 reckons that since implementing these mini-stays , @entity19 has seen a 10 % increase in occupancy			1
" most of the time , it 's for business guests , " says @entity30			2
" many of them might have an early meeting , and they want a place to get themselves ready and have a shower			0
" others have a late flight , and they want some place to leave their bag , and maybe have a drink at the bar or have some tea before heading to the airport			0
" see also : airports ' tiniest sleep spaces the boutique @entity68 , also in @entity18 , has also seen an increase in its revenue after partnering with dayuse - hotels.com , an online reservation service that lists day rates offered by high - end hotels			1
@entity74 , the senior sales manager at the @entity68 , estimates that in the year since they started taking day bookings they 've generated an extra £ 10,000 ( $ 15,880 ) in revenue			1
" usually , between 11am and 5pm our guestrooms are empty , " explains @entity74			0
" now , if we have one guest that wants to come for the day , and another who has a late check - in , we can use that room twice , " he adds			2
if the hotel was situated closer to an airport , @entity74 reckons that the hotel 's revenue would be substantially higher due to the demand from business travelers			1
dayuse - hotels.com was the brainchild of @entity94 and @entity95 , both of whom worked at the @entity98 in @entity99			0
the hotel is particularly popular with touring artists and musicians			0
often , the guests would ask about renting a room for a few hours , just for a place to relax before a performance			2
@entity94 and @entity107 recognised that there was a gap in the market , and the idea for dayuse - hotels was born			2
though originally it was strictly a @entity99 company , dayuse - hotels.com has since become global , and today is partnered with 350 hotels in nine different countries , including the four - star @entity117 in @entity119 , and the designer @entity121 in @entity122			0
while @entity107 purports that many of the site 's users are indeed interested in the rooms for business reasons , the layout of the homepage says otherwise			2
categories at the bottom include " affair , " " infidelity , " " cheating , " " love hotel , " and -- for the narcoleptic -- " nap			0
" " in @entity99 , it is more used for romantic reasons , " admits @entity137			0
" it 's just a much more touristic city ; people do n't visit @entity99 for business			0
" in @entity18 and @entity119 , it 's different			2
because our economy is so terrible , you 'll see @entity149 businessmen coming to @entity18 for the day just to open a bank account			1
they need a room just for chilling , a rest , and a quick nap			0
then they take the train back to @entity99			0
" @entity156 sees the trend expanding , especially as dayuse - hotels.com is working on rolling out themed packages designed to pull in a more specialised clientele			0
examples include fitness - or gastronomy - themed bundles that will lure in foodies and health gurus , and could ultimately transform the way day rates are perceived			1
@entity74 notes that while day rates have become more mainstream , they are not new to the luxury hotel market			1
" there 's always been a demand for it , but hotels have kept it really quiet , " he notes			2
he 's delighted that dayuse - hotels.com has created a platform for high - end day rates			1
" it 's given us an incremental revenue we would not have otherwise have , " he says			0
" you ca n't say no to that , especially in this economy			0
