@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 : a-list @entity5 megastar , iconic kung fu hero to millions and basically a really famous guy			1
we had been pursuing an in - depth interview with him for months through " the @entity11 , " @entity3 's all - conquering management company			1
gaining access to @entity3 's personal " museum " uncovered many gems during filming			1
schedules conflicted , dates came and went - then finally a breakthrough			2
he was setting aside an afternoon in between a dizzying array of international commitments			0
better still , we would be filming in @entity3 's @entity0 den -- his office which is home to a private " museum " of memorabilia and awards collected over the years			1
@entity28 is a sprawling , multi-tentacled empire with offices all over the world - but his hideaway is in a particularly charmless area of @entity0			1
once inside the dreary office block , you pass a team of people working on @entity3 merchandise and into @entity3 's inner sanctum			1
the first thing that confronts you is the ordered chaos in his suite of rooms			2
clearly incapable of throwing anything away , his office is littered with props , costumes , trophies ( including several for his bowling skills ) , cds , and -- some might say -- junk			2
he is also a compulsive collector			0
as he later tells us , if a friend gives him a gift such as a tea cup , he begins amassing tea cups until he has to build glass display cases to house his out - of - control collection			2
another obsession is antique locks , including one vast , heavy model he hand - carried back from @entity67			0
our first sighting of @entity3 is odd			1
we were told he is a very late riser and the main challenge of the shoot for his staff was getting him out of bed			0
instead , he arrives early , unannounced and on his own - a rarity with film stars			1
we are still setting up and he stares at us blankly through thick glasses , then disappears into his gym without a word			0
we begin to wonder if he actually knows about the interview			0
introductions are finally made and the effusive , likeable @entity3 is alive and well			2
he throws himself into the idea of us filming him working out - putting on a bright yellow sweat suit , then pouring out the sweat from his sleeve after 40 minutes on the cross trainer			0
during the interview , he is animated and a great story teller , discussing brushes with the triads and the last time he saw @entity93 alive			0
as @entity1 's @entity95 poster boy , he was clearly uncomfortable discussing @entity96 and drew the distinction between sport and politics currently favored by the @entity100			0
our eventual guided tour took in his room of autographed film star photographs ( @entity104 his most treasured ) and his personal walk - in wine chiller , which was naturally behind a false wall			1
his business drive is evident			0
his merchandising arm produces clothes , glasses and @entity3 action figures , while he also dabbles in gizmos that interest him - he owns the distribution rights to the @entity114 in @entity0 and cheerfully taught @entity115 how to ride one			1
exhausted , we took our leave after a five hour shoot while @entity3 still appeared to be warming up			1
the following day he left for @entity119 - ahead of @entity95 duties on the @entity121 and a quick skip over to @entity122			0
unarguably " the hardest working man in showbusiness " -- when awake			0

rare treat to film in @entity3 's @entity0 den
personal office looked like *organized* chaos and revealed his many collections
action superstar was still raring to go after exhausting five - hour shoot
