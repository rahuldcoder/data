-- from @entity3 to the foothills of the @entity5 , the call for revenge echoes across the internet			0
online forums associated with @entity9 overflow with eulogies for @entity11 , and with declarations that global jihad will continue			1
even @entity15 groups have emerged to mourn the demise of the world 's most wanted man			1
@entity9 's affiliates across the @entity21 world have published effusive tributes to @entity11 and pledged support for @entity9 " central			1
" the @entity25 made a point of pledging loyalty to @entity11 's deputy , @entity28 : " may @entity29 increase your reward and may @entity29 grant you the best consolation in this calamity , " the group declared			2
along with the condolences have come threats , both vague and specific			0
in a message posted on the @entity39 and translated by the @entity40 ( a @entity41 - based group which monitors jihadist sites ) , one contributor wrote : " we declare that all @entity41 interests , wherever they may be , are legitimate targets for the mujahideen , and the interests of the @entity50 countries as well , because they are one alliance			2
" the leader of @entity53 -- the most active of the group 's franchises , warned @entity41 : " you have to fight another generation in the wake of another , until your life is ruined , your days are disturbed and you face disgrace			1
" there have also been calls in jihadist forums for @entity9 to revive its experiments with weapons of mass destruction			2
the @entity40 translated one such appeal on the @entity39 : " we want to manufacture soman , ricin , mustard gas and vx nerve gas , " it declared			0
but there have also been calls for more basic attacks			0
" go out at night in a targeted infidel compound with thirty canisters and a phone , " read one			0
a contributor calling himself @entity85 wrote : " we direct the supporters of jihad to the necessity of taking immediate action , " he wrote , according to @entity40			0
" we will not be content but with tens of casualties , if not hundreds , if not thousands , " wrote another			0
but there are also appeals for careful planning			0
@entity95 , a frequent contributor to jihadist websites , wrote on may 2 : " we do not want operations here and there for vengeance ; we want specific operations that are planned with wisdom and patience			0
" so much for aspirations			0
in its only statement since @entity11 's death , @entity9 issued familiar threats -- to the leadership of @entity109 and the people and interests of the @entity41			1
the @entity109 @entity114 , in a show of solidarity , also declared president @entity115 of @entity109 its @entity117 target			0
perhaps no idle warning : @entity109 blamed a senior @entity9 figure for planning a bomb attack that nearly killed then - president gen. @entity121 , at the end of 2003			1
and the @entity109 @entity114 has assassinated many senior @entity109 officials			0
most analysts concur that @entity9 wants to launch a large - scale attack to prove its resilience and rally supporters			1
but that 's easier said than done			0
@entity9 " central " has spent much of the past decade on the defensive -- deflated by the loss of senior leaders , the drone campaign in the @entity135 - @entity109 border area and a withering bank balance			2
some @entity137 who went to wage jihad in recent years told of being asked for money by their hosts , having to purchase their weapons and being on the run from one mountain refuge to another			1
@entity0 terrorism analyst @entity146 , who studied their experiences for the @entity149 , wrote that one @entity155 - @entity154 group " was trained inside small mountain shacks , away from the all - seeing eyes of the drones			0
the loss of an increasing number of operatives prompted an order from @entity9 's top command that fighters remain inside as much as possible , " according to @entity162 , a @entity154 recruit			1
better intelligence has made it more difficult to launch coordinated attacks in the @entity41 and @entity137			1
in the last decade , @entity41 surveillance of would - be jihadists , and their movements in and out of the country , has improved dramatically - as shown by the arrest and conviction of conspirators such as @entity173 , @entity174 and others			2
similarly , cells in @entity137 have been broken up -- especially in @entity155 , @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179			2
the last major attack attributed to @entity9 sympathizers was the @entity183 subway bombings in 2005			1
so @entity9 may look for other targets			2
@entity185 was deputy assistant secretary of defense for special operations and counterterrorism during the @entity189 administration			0
" the @entity41 homeland is relatively harder now , logistically , " he said			2
" my chief worry at the moment is the @entity194 and @entity195 oilfields			1
energy security has been a principal rationale for @entity41 involvement in the region			2
" such an attack would be highly symbolic , practically significant , and logistically easier " than trying to mount an attack in the @entity41 , said @entity185			1
an attack on oil sources would fit with @entity9 's long - held belief that the @entity41 economy is vulnerable			1
" just as it claimed credit for bringing down the @entity208 because of the cost it imposed on the @entity208 for invading @entity135 , it has the aim of bringing us to our knees economically , " @entity185 said			0
sabotaging @entity195 oil exports would also fit with @entity9 's core goals			1
in 2004 , @entity11 urged supporters : " be active and prevent them from reaching the oil , and mount your operations accordingly , particularly in @entity221 and the @entity195			2
" it became known as @entity9 's " bleed until bankruptcy " strategy			1
since @entity11 's death , jihadist forums have talked of attacks on shipping in the @entity230 at the tip of the @entity195 , and in the @entity232			1
in the last year , @entity9 has launched several attacks on oil installations and pipelines in @entity238			2
in october 2002 , a suicide attack by a small boat on the @entity154 tanker @entity242 , off the coast of @entity238 , left one crew member dead and 90,000 barrels of oil in the @entity195			1
and in february 2006 , militants in vehicles loaded with explosives tried to break through the gates of the @entity251 oil refinery in eastern @entity194			2
however , @entity194 intelligence has been successful in subduing @entity9 cells in the kingdom in recent years , while security at oil refineries and pumping stations has been reinforced			1
for the @entity41 , there remains the threat from " lone wolf " radicals , enraged by @entity11 's assassination but with little in the way of training and infrastructure to carry out an attack on the scale of 9/11			1
@entity269 's attempt to explode a car bomb in @entity272 's @entity271 a year ago is the most obvious recent example of such an attack			1
that 's the foremost concern of the @entity276 and @entity277 , which issued a bulletin to law enforcement saying @entity11 's death " is likely to provide motivation for homeland attacks , particularly from like - minded , ideologically focused lone offenders ... unburdened by organizational constraints			0
" so far , as information from the @entity289 compound is analyzed , no concrete plots to the @entity41 have emerged			2
but according to one document recovered in february 2010 , @entity9 had discussed derailing trains in the @entity41 such a modest objective compared to the 9/11 attacks may be an acknowledgment of the group 's tougher surroundings -- and a sign that @entity9 is moving toward attacks focused on causing maximum disruption and economic cost			1
the @entity238 cleric @entity301 has championed this approach			0
last year , @entity53 -- in its online magazine ' @entity304 ' -- boasted of spending just $ 4,000 in an effort to bring down @entity41 - bound cargo planes by hiding @entity307 explosive in printers			1
assassinations may also play a greater role			0
in 2009 , an attempt to kill the @entity194 security chief , prince @entity312 , using a suicide bomber with @entity307 in his underwear , came within feet of achieving its aim			2
a few months later , a suicide bomber killed seven @entity319 employees at a base in @entity321			0
whatever the future brings , it is likely @entity9 's plans will be more difficult to track			1
in the past 10 years it has spawned cells active from @entity326 to @entity327 -- thriving wherever the authority of the state is absent and the territory remote			0
@entity9 ideologue @entity331 once said : " @entity9 is not an organization , nor do we want it to be			0
it is a call , a reference			0
" counter-terrorism analysts say that operationally , @entity53 , strengthened by some veteran @entity194 jihadists , may now pose a greater threat than @entity9 central			1
in @entity341 , @entity9 affiliate @entity340 has taken advantage of anarchy ; in the @entity344 , @entity345 has made money from smuggling and possibly drug - trafficking			1
some analysts say it may have used the proceeds to acquire sophisticated weapons such as shoulder - launched ground - to - air missiles			0
there is also growing evidence that @entity356 cells have established themselves in the @entity357			0
add to this the risk that @entity9 and other @entity356 groups , after being bypassed by the largely secular nature of the @entity361 , will try to take advantage of new instability in @entity366 states			1
the likely heir to @entity11 , @entity28 , has already spoken at length about such opportunities , focusing on his native @entity370			0
in @entity221 , @entity9 ( whose animosity toward @entity373 almost matches its hatred of the @entity375 ) has already shown it will take drastic steps to inflame @entity378 - @entity373 tensions by attacking shrines and religious festivals			0
growing tensions in @entity382 and the @entity373 - populated provinces of eastern @entity194 could provide openings			0
@entity345 has already warned of the struggle to come against " shi'ites and the apostates and their men so that @entity29 will judge between us and them			0
" for now , @entity9 's core leadership is probably focused on survival , anxious that the " treasure trove " of @entity289 might give away its refuges and tactics			1
but , says @entity185 , " the succession dynamic itself may fuel the urgency of a spectacular attack			0
there may even be regional competition to do this , so @entity11 's demise might make @entity9 more dangerous structurally			1

better intelligence has made an attack on @entity41 or @entity137 more difficult
sabotaging @entity194 and @entity195 oilfields would fit with @entity9 's core goals
@entity53 may be a greater threat now , some say
@entity356 groups may want to take advantage of instability from recent uprisings
