-- @entity2 , people thought that swarming creatures such as fish , bees and locusts communicated their movements by " thought transference , " or telepathy			2
thanks in part to the work of @entity15 ecologist @entity14 , now we know better			1
@entity14 's lab is using computer - vision technology and even the @entity19 's motion - sensing camera , called @entity20 , to try to get a grip on how these creatures maintain their individually but also function so gracefully as a collective			1
" computer vision has been very important to us			1
this is where you program a computer to see the world for us , " he said in an interview last year at @entity26 , a science , technology and big - ideas conference held in @entity30 , @entity31			0
among the lab 's most surprising discoveries : locusts in the western @entity41 swarm because they 're trying to not to be eaten by their cannibalistic buddies			2
" we just discovered by accident that the locusts were trying to eat each other , " he said			0
" so when it looks like a cooperative swarm , in actual fact it 's a selfish , sort of cannibalistic horde			0
everyone is trying to eat everyone else and trying to avoid being eaten			0
" using tools like @entity20 , @entity14 's team is able to collect a much more detailed data set about how various organisms behave , which in turn makes it easier to figure out what they 're doing and why			2
what 's @entity62 : in @entity63 , sunny with a chance of locusts all this may be interesting enough in the abstract ( @entity14 said he 's been fascinated by swarming organisms since he was a young boy )			1
but it 's also a matter of life and death			0
locust swarms are blamed for countless deaths in @entity76 countries including @entity63 , which @entity14 visited to conduct some of his research			1
the swarms buzz across the desert , chewing up all of the crops and vegetation in their paths			0
on tuesday , the @entity84 's @entity83 said in a news release that locust swarms were threatening pastures and crops in @entity89 and @entity90			1
research about how and why the locusts swarm could lead scientists to be able to forecast locust swarms just like they would a weather event such as a tornado or hurricane			1
" why this is important is that we can now build better predictive models and computational models of where swarms may break out , " @entity14 said			2
" so that could be very helpful for control measures			0
" genetically modified mosquitoes fight dengue fever			0

researcher uses @entity19 and computer vision to study swarming behavior
@entity15 researcher @entity14 long has been fascinated with collective behavior
he studies , among other things , why locusts swarm in @entity76
the @entity84 's *agriculture* group says swarms are *impacting* @entity90 and @entity89
