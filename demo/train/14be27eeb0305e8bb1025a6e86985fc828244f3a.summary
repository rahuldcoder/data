-- republicans now have the @entity2 and control of @entity4 going into next year			1
this means there can be no excuses for why bipartisan solutions designed to help the @entity10 people can not pass the @entity2 and land on the president @entity13 's desk for his signature			1
but winning this election is not enough			0
republicans must be prepared to not only keep the @entity2 in 2016 , but also build a foundation that will preserve their majority for the next several cycles			1
republicans will have to thread the needle between opposing the president and pushing forward their own agenda			0
congressional republicans must show they can truly govern and try to avoid excessive high profile fights that are only popular to the party 's base			2
republicans won because the president 's policies were on the ballot and so were the many incumbents who supported them			2
the electoral atmosphere could not have been better for the @entity29 , as the @entity36 mishandled many issues , such as the @entity39 scandal , the immigration crisis , the growing crisis with @entity42 in the @entity43 and the health scares over @entity45 in the @entity10			1
it 's an exciting moment for the @entity29 because it can showcase its policies			1
toward the end of the @entity51 administration , we had lost our way and wandered into the wilderness and let the other side take control			0
for the first time in eight years , @entity29 will have the chance to demonstrate that they are the party of common sense ideas , because they will run the entire show on @entity61			1
they can start the process of putting in place a smarter , leaner and transparent government that restores freedom , grows the economy and creates more jobs			0
figuring out ways to unleash the @entity10 potential will be the solution to keeping a lasting @entity29 majority			1
now is the time for party leaders , rank - and - file members of @entity4 and governors to come forward and present the best ideas our party has to offer			1
we have two steady hands at the helm with speaker @entity82 and soon - to - be @entity2 @entity83 majority leader @entity83			1
they do not overreact in times of intense legislative drama and are able to negotiate solid deals in order to move the ball forward without giving up their core conservative values			0
in addition , @entity29 lieutenants like @entity36 majority leader @entity93 , @entity95 @entity94 and senate republican whip @entity96 are all loyal and very able leaders to help implement the party 's agenda			1
@entity101 is not on the @entity29 's side			1
@entity29 have a very limited window to demonstrate that they are the party of real change			2
they have next year to push through legislation to the president 's desk for his signature			0
that is why @entity29 must not get caught up in the 2016 election year cycle before presidential politics takes over			2
if the @entity29 focuses too much on who sits in the @entity114 too early , many of the party 's efforts will end up in legislative quicksand			2
yes , there will be several high - profile senators who will be positioning themselves for a presidential run , but the focus of @entity2 efforts must not change because of them			2
there is serious work to be done			0
the @entity29 must unveil an agenda that addresses tax reform , reins in spending , offers regulatory reform for business growth , tackles energy issues , pushes through trade deals and improves our educational system			2
while we can continue to show why @entity136 remains a failure , we do not have 60 votes in the @entity2 to repeal it			2
but we can make some changes , such as repealing the medical device tax			0
if @entity13 and @entity2 @entity142 reject these ideas through the veto pen or the filibuster , it will be obvious to @entity10 just who is obstructing progress			1
@entity147 , however , remains the elephant in the room for @entity29			0
the president is likely going to move his chess piece on this first issue through executive orders this year			0
while the @entity29 wo n't ever have an amnesty style bill that the @entity142 have proposed in the past , @entity29 must offer a version of immigration reform in order to attract @entity159 voters and take the issue off the table			0
speaker of the house @entity82 constantly reminded @entity10 that hundreds of bills that have passed the @entity36 now remain trapped in the @entity164			0
that talking point will no longer exist under @entity29 control			0
while members of the @entity29 are slapping each other on the back for the hard - fought and well - deserved victory , the @entity29 brand still remains stagnant outside the beltway and must be fixed			1
the starting bell for next year has already rung			0
it 's time for @entity29 to shine and prove that they can successfully navigate this new journey forward			1
the election victory is theirs to build upon , or lose again very shortly .			0

@entity179 : winning the *midterm* elections is not enough for republicans
@entity179 : @entity29 must try to keep the @entity2 in 2016 and its majority in the coming cycles
he says now is time for @entity29 leaders to present the best ideas that can help @entity10
@entity179 : it 's a well - deserved victory , but @entity29 brand is stagnant and must be fixed
