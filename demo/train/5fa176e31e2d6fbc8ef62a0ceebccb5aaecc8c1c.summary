-- it was far from vintage @entity2 , but it was enough to keep alive the @entity5 club 's dwindling hopes of retaining the @entity8 league title			1
with white handkerchiefs waving in the @entity11 to indicate the fans ' frustration at what appeared to be another disappointing setback , @entity9 came to the rescue on sunday to earn a 2 - 1 victory against @entity18			1
having been knocked out of the @entity21 , then losing the @entity23 final to @entity24 , @entity20 's team had been staring down the barrel of an unthinkable fourth successive defeat			0
with @entity28 having gone seven points clear at the top of the table with friday 's 2 - 0 win over @entity33 , it would 've spelled disaster if @entity2 could not recover from @entity36 's opener for the fourth - placed @entity37			1
the early signs were n't good			0
after @entity9 had a goal ruled out for offside , @entity36 hit the @entity2 woodwork with a spectacular overhead kick , then @entity43 smacked the @entity18 bar when it seemed easier to score			1
@entity36 ghosted through @entity2 's frail defense to slot in a low shot five minutes after the break , and teammate @entity50 had an effort ruled out for offside soon after			0
to the home supporters ' intense relief , @entity52 provided the equalizer in the 72nd minute with his 15th league goal this season , diverting a low shot from @entity43 into the net from close range			1
soon after that , @entity9 picked himself up after being fouled on the edge of the penalty area and fired a free - kick through the wall			0
it ended what , for the four - time world player of the year , was a goal drought -- four games without scoring -- as he netted for the 26th time in @entity73 , leaving him third in the @entity76 standings behind @entity28 's @entity77 ( 27 ) and @entity24 's @entity78 ( 28 )			2
it proved to be the winner , though @entity2 needed @entity81 -- who squandered a great scoring chance not long beforehand -- to make a brave block to stop a goal - bound @entity18 shot in time added on			1
the result left @entity2 four points behind @entity28 with four games to play -- the last of which will be between the two teams at the @entity11			0
it lifted @entity2 into second place above @entity24 , without a match this weekend ahead of wednesday 's @entity21 semifinal first leg at home to @entity95			0
@entity28 , meanwhile , will be seeking to make it an all - @entity8 final as the capital team hosts @entity99 club @entity98 in tuesday 's opening leg			1
earlier sunday , @entity102 consolidated fifth place with a 4 - 0 win at home to @entity106 , @entity101 moved up to mid-table safety with a 3 - 1 win that almost certainly condemned @entity109 to relegation , and @entity111 beat second - bottom @entity112 4 - 2			1
in @entity114 , third - placed @entity113 suffered a shock 3 - 1 defeat at @entity117 which moved the home side four points clear of @entity119 in the relegation playoff place			2
fourth - placed @entity121 moved to within four points of @entity113 with a 4 - 1 win at second - bottom @entity124			1
in @entity126 , second - placed @entity125 clinched a spot in next season 's @entity21 with a 1 - 0 win at home to @entity131 , thanks to an early goal from former @entity135 striker @entity134			2
it put @entity125 seven points behind champions @entity138 , who won the @entity140 on saturday			0
third - placed @entity141 lost more ground , being held 0 - 0 at @entity143			0
in @entity145 , @entity144 clinched a 33rd league title with two matches to play as @entity149 forward @entity148 scored both goals in a 2 - 0 win against @entity152			1
@entity144 had been runner - up to @entity154 for the past three seasons			0
seven points back , @entity156 clinched @entity145 's second @entity21 place with a 1 - 0 win at @entity159 , with @entity154 in third another 11 points adrift with a game in hand			2
in the @entity164 , @entity163 caused a big shock by winning the @entity166 for the first time , coming from behind to beat league - leading @entity168 5 - 1			2
@entity169 and @entity170 scored twice to give the mid-table team a place in the @entity174 qualifying rounds next season			0
it had lost its only other finals in 1928 and 1977 .			0

@entity9 gives @entity2 a 2 - 1 victory with his 26th league goal of season
sunday 's win keeps second - placed @entity8 champion four points off the lead
@entity18 had taken the lead just after *halftime* before @entity52 equalized
