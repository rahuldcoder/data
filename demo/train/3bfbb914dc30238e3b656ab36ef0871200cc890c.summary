@entity0 -- on the @entity4 map of global press freedom , @entity2 appears as one big black spot			2
@entity2 is ranked at 173 in the most recent @entity7 due in part to its track record for imprisoning journalists and censoring the @entity11			1
and the situation shows no sign of improving			2
last month , global viewers witnessed reporters for the @entity16 and @entity1 get shoved and manhandled outside the trial of activist @entity18			1
foreign media were literally pushed away from the story			1
" and it 's gotten much worse in recent years , " says @entity21 , the @entity23 's @entity22 who has over 20 years of experience covering @entity2			2
" particularly in the countryside and in small towns , if you happen to be covering a story that the local officials just do not want to get out , they will do more than push people around			2
they will grab cameras and confiscate them , and in some cases smash them			0
" @entity38 threat foreign correspondents in @entity2 face bureaucratic harassment as well , with the increasing threat of having a visa not renewed or even revoked			1
" this year of course was unprecedented , the pressure on the @entity49 and @entity50 , both of which had written about the private financial affairs of relatives of senior leaders , " says @entity43 , president of the @entity44 of @entity2 and @entity45 for the @entity46			0
" entire bureaus of those organizations were implicitly threatened , because they had to wait for their visas until the very , very last minute			2
" @entity60 adds : " in the absence of any official explanation of why they had to wait this long , it will certainly feed suspicion that it 's retribution for the content of their coverage			0
" but the risks are far greater for @entity71 nationals who can be continually harassed or jailed for contributing to a sensitive report			1
" foreign correspondents are at times vulnerable , but really , the people we most need to protect are our sources , and then our @entity71 colleagues , because unlike a foreign correspondent they ca n't leave , " @entity21 says			1
the government says it wants journalists to cover news in an objective and fair - minded way			0
but at the same time , does what it can to shut down or discredit stories that upset the political balance			0
losing its grip despite its attempts to pressure reporters and their sources and to craft a state - approved version of events , @entity89 appears to be losing its grip on the story			2
" as @entity2 becomes more open and more integrated in the economy , there 's more information available			0
( with ) listed companies in @entity101 and @entity0 , company records are available			0
official affiliations to these companies are available			0
so the new phenomenon now is getting at the data and to mine the information , " says @entity103 , journalism professor at the @entity104 and co-director of the @entity106			0
but if @entity2 wants an open economy , it must be open to transparency			0
and more transparency means more data for journalists to dig into			0
likewise , more access to social media platforms like @entity118 or @entity120 's @entity119 has led to more citizen journalists breaking the story			1
" the proliferation and availability of smartphones means that migrant workers in factories in @entity2 are also communicating through social media , whether it 's through @entity119 or @entity118 , " says @entity21			1
enterprising reporters " the government is trying very hard to get on top of these technologies , but i think the trend is there			1
they 're losing control of the narrative			0
" even from inside @entity2 's media machine , enterprising local reporters are working independently of the official party line			1
" they are doing good work in commercial - run media			1
but also some are doing good work in the state media and that 's interesting , " @entity103 tells me			1
" we can not assume that if it 's a party paper , you must be toeing the party line			2
this is the growing diversity of coverage in local @entity71 media			1
" and if they are censored in print , they can always push the story online			0
@entity103 fires up @entity119 on her smartphone , and shows me an array of independent @entity71 media channels inside the popular messaging app. @entity89 may be playing rough with reporters , but reporters are playing smart			1
there 's still room to maneuver around @entity2 's big black spot on journalism .			0

foreign correspondents falling foul of @entity71 authorities as they take a tougher line
many face bureaucratic harassment with work visas not renewed
risks far greater for @entity71 nationals who can be continually harassed or jailed
but enterprising reporters are using @entity11 , social media to play the censors
