at least 14 people , including a general , were killed thursday when a @entity3 military helicopter was shot down by " terrorists " near @entity5 , acting president @entity6 told @entity7			1
@entity6 said the chopper , which was carrying soldiers for a troop rotation , was shot down with a @entity12 rocket - propelled grenade launcher			1
militants in the rebel stronghold claimed responsibility for downing the helicopter , a spokesman for the militants said			2
the aircraft had flown there from @entity21 , he said , where the @entity3 military has a substantial presence			0
the large loss of life will be a major blow to the @entity3 military , which on monday toughened its approach to the separatist movement when it launched a fierce assault on militants who 'd taken control of part of @entity34 airport			1
also in @entity5 , the self - declared mayor said @entity37 separatist militants are holding four @entity39 observers who have been missing since monday			1
but he declined to say where			0
" our militants got them , " @entity40 said thursday			0
" they were detained because they did n't respect my request			0
i asked them not to leave @entity34 ( city )			2
they decided they were smarter and could come here			0
" @entity40 added that the monitors from the @entity51 were not being held in the town			1
they also are not " exchange material , " he said , indicating that they were not being held to swap for separatists detained by @entity58 authorities			0
@entity40 said he had been in contact with the @entity51 , and they were assessing the situation			1
he said he would probably release the monitors soon but would n't say when			0
on wednesday , @entity64 spokesman @entity63 said that a @entity37 group was holding the monitors and that negotiations for their release were " in process			0
" the four team members , who are @entity74 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 , were on a routine patrol monday east of @entity76 when last heard from , according to the @entity51			2
the last time an @entity51 team went missing in the @entity34 region , its members also turned up in the hands of the militant separatists in @entity5 and were described by @entity40 as " prisoners of war			1
" they were freed just over a week later			0
there were fears wednesday for the safety of another group of 11 monitors who went missing after being stopped at a roadblock in @entity90 , west of @entity76 , but the group later re-established contact with the @entity51			1
the @entity51 said thursday that the 11 had been abducted for seven hours by a dozen - strong armed group but were released			1
separatists : bodies to be returned to @entity12 dozens of @entity37 separatists were killed after @entity3 security forces launched their assault on @entity100 on monday , following the militants ' seizure of a terminal			1
the military 's move -- only hours after president - elect @entity106 declared his election win -- was interpreted by some as an indication that he will take a tougher stance as he seeks to unify the country			1
now , the grim task of returning the dead to their families is under way			0
at least 33 @entity12 citizens are among the militants killed during the violence , a spokesman for the self - declared @entity118 told a @entity123 team at the morgue			1
the bodies have been identified , and there is an agreement with the local police to escort the remains back to @entity12 soon , several separatist representatives said			1
the bodies will be taken across the border to the southwestern @entity12 city of @entity133			2
from there , they will be transported to different cities according to where they are from , reportedly including @entity139 and @entity140 in the @entity12 republic of @entity142			2
the @entity123 team at the morgue in @entity34 city saw at least 10 coffins			2
the separatist spokesman at the morgue said the men were volunteers from across @entity12 who had come to help stand with the separatists against the authorities in @entity58			2
the spokesman also said that there are still about 15 bodies left at the airport that the separatists have n't been able to collect or identify			0
about 20 of those killed are @entity3 , he said			0
the @entity34 mayor 's official website put the airport death toll at 40 tuesday , including two civilians , but did not specify how many were separatists			1
but the separatist spokesman said the death toll could be as high as 70			0
if confirmed , this would make monday the deadliest day in @entity165 since the bloody clashes in @entity58 's @entity167 , or @entity167 , which triggered the ouster of @entity170 president @entity169 in february and led to the current spiral into violence in the east			0
the separatists have until now insisted that their movement is homegrown , so their very public acknowledgment of so many @entity12 citizens among those killed monday marks a shift in approach			2
it could be intended to goad @entity139 into a response at a time when the separatist movement is under pressure to find a way forward and has shown signs of division within its ranks			0
@entity58 and the @entity190 have accused @entity12 of coordinating and supplying the separatists , a claim @entity139 has denied			2
@entity12 has said it will respect sunday 's election results			2
on thursday , a @entity195 official with direct knowledge of the latest intelligence said 30,000 @entity12 troops that had been amassed along the @entity12 - @entity165 border have been moving back to their home bases over the last several days			1
about 10,000 troops -- mainly infantry -- remain along @entity12 's border with eastern @entity165 , the official said , and there are some signs those troops will be pulling back as well			1
@entity208 this week also reported signs that some @entity12 troops near @entity165 's eastern border may be preparing to pull back			1
the @entity195 has been using satellites to track @entity12 troop movements for weeks , and both the @entity195 and @entity208 have released imagery to bolster their case that @entity12 had amassed tens of thousands of troops along the border			1
several @entity195 officials have said it appears the @entity12 have decided to try to work with the new @entity3 government , but officials also point out that it would n't take much to bring a large number of @entity12 forces back to the border via transport aircraft at any time			1
governor in talks with separatists @entity231 , the billionaire governor of @entity34 , acknowledged in a @entity123 interview in @entity58 that a @entity3 military operation was under way in the @entity34 region , but he was unable to comment further			1
@entity231 said he was in talks with @entity37 separatist leaders in the region to try to calm the situation , adding that the aim was to " reach real understanding , " rather than just a deal			1
" we are having dialogue , which is dragging out because they seem to have a constant rotation of their leaders , but i hope that in the final analysis we will reach an agreement and reconciliation to work together , " he said			0
