the family of a @entity2 fighter pilot mercilessly killed by @entity3 is calling for total revenge			1
lt. @entity6 , 27 , was burned alive while confined in a cage			0
in response , @entity2 executed two prisoners -- @entity11 , a would - be suicide bomber whose release @entity3 had previously demanded as part of a prisoner exchange , and @entity15 , a former top aide to the deceased leader of @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20			1
the pilot 's father is demanding his country do more			1
" these were criminals and there is no comparison between them and @entity6			0
his blood is more valued than @entity11 and @entity15 , " said @entity6 's father , @entity27			1
" i demand that revenge should be bigger than executing prisoners			0
" his son 's horrific death was recorded and the video was posted online tuesday			1
@entity4 is not showing the images , which drew global condemnation and prompted protests and vows of retaliation in @entity2			1
@entity41 has promised a strong response , saying that @entity3 is n't just fighting his nation , but warring against " noble @entity44 " itself			1
the country now wants to step up airstrikes against the terrorist organization , according to a source with direct knowledge of the situation			0
but the pilot 's uncle , @entity54 , told @entity4 that he also wants to see ground troops involved in the @entity57 - led coalition against @entity3 in @entity19 and @entity58			1
said the pilot 's father : " i demand that this criminal organization ( @entity3 ) ... should be annihilated			1
" what comes next ? demonstrators took to the streets in @entity64 and the pilot 's hometown immediately after the video was made public			1
one protester held a poster that read : " they burned our hearts , so let 's burn their dens , and their prisoners in our prisons			0
" @entity2 government spokesman @entity77 has vowed " an earthshaking retaliation " and " a revenge that equals the tragedy that has befallen the @entity2			2
" exactly what that response will look like remains to be seen , although the outlines of it are starting to take shape			0
@entity2 's military is seeking to conduct more of the @entity90 airstrikes assigned by the coalition , a @entity57 official told @entity4			1
according to that official , the number of strikes @entity2 can carry out will depend on the location of the targets , weather and other factors			2
@entity3 apparently made a big show of the pilot 's brutal execution in @entity101 , its stronghold in @entity58			1
an activist network , " @entity106 , " reported that the killing was being shown , repeatedly , on large screens across the city			0
one of @entity3 ' propaganda production outlets posted a video online that appears to show a crowd cheering as flames around the pilot grow			2
the video features a tight shot of a boy , looking up as if in awe and saying that he would " burn the pilot " himself if he had a chance and that " all @entity119 tyrants should also be burned			0
" the boy can also be heard saying " @entity121 the dog			0
" because the video is carefully orchestrated propaganda , @entity4 has no way to know if people in @entity101 really feel this way , if other children were present or whether the video participants ' responses were authentic or a result of intimidation			2
there are @entity90 activists inside @entity101 who operate very quietly			0
one of them , with " @entity101 is being slaughtered silently , " told @entity4 on tuesday that on january 8 , he was standing in the street when several @entity3 fighters approached , bragging that they had set the pilot on fire			1
other @entity3 members acted impressed but dubious , and a disturbingly juvenile moment ensued in which the @entity3 fighters making the claim said that it was true , they were there and saw it			2
@entity2 last week said it was willing to release @entity147 , the would - be suicide bomber , in exchange for @entity6 , but the swap never happened			2
the @entity2 government repeatedly asked @entity3 to show proof that the pilot was still alive			1
shortly after the video of @entity6 's killing became public , @entity2 military spokesman @entity153 said that authorities believe the pilot had been killed as far back as january 3 , before @entity3 began making its public demands for the release of @entity147			1
@entity41 arrived back in @entity2 on wednesday after cutting short a visit to the @entity57 , where he met with president @entity121			2
" the brave pilot gave his life defending his faith , country and nation and joined other @entity2 martyrs who gave their lives for @entity2 , " @entity41 said in a televised statement tuesday , describing @entity3 as a cowardly and deviant group that has nothing to do with @entity44			1
@entity170 was captured by @entity3 in december after his fighter jet crashed near @entity101			0
the pilot was one of eight children , according to the @entity173			0
he was from @entity176 governorate and graduated from @entity177 , the newspaper said			0
at the time of his capture , his father told the paper that his son was " a very modest and religious person " who memorized the @entity184 and " was never harmful to anyone			0
" @entity57 secretary of state @entity186 described @entity6 as everything @entity3 is not : " he was brave , compassionate and principled			0
" " that he was murdered after his father 's plea for compassion reminds all the world that this foe has no agenda other than to kill and destroy , and places no value on life , including that of fellow @entity198 , " @entity186 said			0
@entity3 is known to be holding at least two @entity200 hostages still : @entity201 , a @entity203 journalist who has appeared in a number of @entity3 - produced videos , and an @entity57 woman who is a 26 - year - old aid worker			0
@entity4 's @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity216 contributed to this report .			2

the pilot 's uncle tells @entity4 he wants to see ground troops in the fight against @entity3
@entity41 says @entity3 is n't fighting just @entity2 but fighting @entity44 itself
in response to the pilot 's horrific death , @entity2 executes @entity11 and @entity15
