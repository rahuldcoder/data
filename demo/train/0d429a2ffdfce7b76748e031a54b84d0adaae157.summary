-- @entity1 was the definition of " fierce " when she arrived on the @entity4 music scene with one of the big break - up songs of the ' 90s , " @entity8			1
" but behind that tough exterior were secrets of a difficult past			2
" as a teen , i was both anorexic and bulimic , " @entity1 recently told health magazine for its december issue			1
" i was a young woman in the public eye , on the receiving end of a lot of attention , and i was trying to protect myself from men who were using their power in ways i was too young to know how to handle			2
" by the time @entity1 was 14 , she had already starred in a popular @entity24 children 's show , started her own record label and had a publishing contract with @entity27 , according to her web site			1
" @entity29 , sadness and pain hit me hard , and i tried to numb those feelings through my relationship with food			0
for four to six months at a time , i would barely eat			0
i lived on a diet of @entity36 , carrots , and black coffee , " she said			1
" i began recovering at 18 , when a sweet friend confronted me			0
" now that she 's older , @entity1 , 35 , said she 's no longer starving herself and has begun to look at eating as " a sort of spiritual practice			1
" her healthier view of food and nutrition is thanks in no small part to a book she discovered a few years ago called " eat to live			0
" " it 's become my bible , pushing me to completely reorient my thinking about what to put into my body			0
... now i concentrate on eating high - nutrient foods like fruit , nuts , collards , kale and spinach			1
i 'm obsessed with them			0
i even put spinach in my smoothies , " the @entity24 musician admitted			0
the seven - time @entity64 winner has also sworn off dairy , on a tip from @entity67 , no less			0
" @entity67 [ told ] me i needed to get rid of the dairy in my fridge to clear up my skin , " she said			2
it 's had a positive effect : @entity1 said her skin " looks great now			1
" but all of that health consciousness does n't mean @entity1 has lost appreciation for the more delectable things in life			1
" do n't get me wrong , " she said in the interview , " i still indulge in a glass of wine or chocolate -- treats are mandatory			0
without deviating from the day - to - day healthy diet once in a while , it would n't be sustainable for me , and that 's what i wanted : an approach to eating to last my entire life			1
" resolving her issues with food and body image has helped @entity1 to develop clarity in other areas of her life as well			1
" i 'm really clear about what my life mission is now			2
there 's no more depression or lethargy , and i feel like i 've returned to the athlete i once was			0
i 'm integrating all the parts of me -- jock , musician , writer , poet , philosopher -- and becoming stronger as a result , " she said			0
" i hope my effort shows any woman battling an eating disorder or poor body image that she 's not alone -- support is out there -- and inspires her to discover her inner athlete			1
