-- nearly seven months after being shot in the head -- an injury that would have killed most people -- @entity5 rep. @entity4 returned to @entity6 in a dramatic and emotional appearance to vote on the debt ceiling compromise			1
she walked onto the @entity10 floor to thunderous applause and left in a glow of bipartisan cheer , sparking an almost immediate discussion of a possible re-election bid			1
but what is in @entity4 ' future was n't immediately clear			2
despite her astounding recovery , she still needed help to make sure she would n't fall , dr. @entity18 noted on @entity0 's " @entity22			1
" and she has much rehabilitation work ahead of her , he said			2
@entity4 ' spokesman , @entity24 , said his boss has not decided whether she will seek re-election			1
" congresswoman @entity4 is focused on her recovery , " he said			1
@entity4 ' close friend rep. @entity28 told @entity33 's " @entity32 " that preparations are nevertheless under way should @entity4 decide to make such a decision			2
" we 're certainly getting her ready to make sure that she can run for re-election at the point that they 're ready to decide on that , " said @entity34 , @entity35			1
@entity4 was shot in the left side of the head during a session with constituents outside a @entity46 supermarket in january			2
six people died in the attack , including a member of @entity4 ' congressional staff			0
initial reports suggested that she was among the fatalities			0
instead , she survived the initial trauma and surgeries and set out on a recovery that colleagues , friends and medical experts have described as remarkable			2
she was released from the @entity46 hospital in january , traveling to @entity60 for rehabilitation			0
in may , she attended her @entity64 officer husband 's space shuttle launch			0
weeks later , she was released from the rehab hospital			0
and monday night , she returned to @entity6			0
" the # @entity66 looks beautiful and i am honored to be at work tonight , " @entity4 tweeted monday			0
her unexpected appearance on the @entity10 floor ignited a long wave of applause and greetings from @entity10 members in both parties			1
her hair still close - cropped from brain surgery to repair the bullet 's damage , @entity4 waved at applauding colleagues with her left hand and mouthed the words " thank you " repeatedly before casting her vote in favor of the debt ceiling proprosal			0
" it 's been very tough , very , very , very hard - edged , and as @entity88 came in and people realized , it was just this wave of recognition , and the @entity10 erupted , " @entity28 said			1
" @entity10 press secretary @entity92 described @entity4 ' appearance as a " great moment			1
" " it was a powerful moment and a wonderful moment , obviously , because of her courage , her bravery , her unbelievable perseverance , and , through her recovery , her commitment to service , " he said			2
" but also it was a testament to ... how something like that can bring everyone together after such a contentious debate			0
" @entity108 , the former @entity4 intern who rushed to her side moments after she was shot , said he was excited to see her recovery			2
" it was absolutely amazing to be able to see her going back to doing what she 's always loved , which is representing her constituents , " @entity108 said			0
@entity4 ' husband , astronaut @entity114 , said in a @entity116 post tuesday that he was lucky to be married to the congresswoman			1
" @entity88 , i 'm so proud of you for everything you have done & continue to do to make this country a better place , " he wrote			1
that @entity4 is still alive , much less able to return to @entity6 , is remarkable , @entity18 said			1
about three - quarters of people with such wounds do n't survive , he said			0
it 's clear that @entity4 is suffering weakness to the right side of her body that would be expected from an injury to the left side of the brain , @entity18 said			1
she did not move her right arm and required assistance standing			0
he said @entity4 still has a lot of rehabilitation work to do			0
most patients in her situation peak in their recovery after 12 to 18 months			2
for now , @entity4 probably has difficulty expressing herself -- a typical trait for people with traumatic brain injuries -- and may have difficulty recalling words			0
that could be difficult for a politician in a re-election campaign , but were @entity4 to run again , it would probably not be an ordinary campaign			1
as her appearance in the @entity10 showed , she has built up an enormous amount of goodwill as the survivor of a shooting rampage			1
" pity the soul that runs against her , " one supporter wrote tuesday morning on @entity116			0
@entity0 's @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 contributed to this report .			0
