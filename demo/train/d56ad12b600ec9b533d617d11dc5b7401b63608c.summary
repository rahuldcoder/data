-- historically , surveillance was difficult and expensive			1
over the decades , as technology advanced , surveillance became easier and easier			1
today , we find ourselves in a world of ubiquitous surveillance , where everything is collected , saved , searched , correlated and analyzed			1
but while technology allowed for an increase in both corporate and government surveillance , the private and public sectors took very different paths to get there			1
the former always collected information about everyone , but over time , collected more and more of it , while the latter always collected maximal information , but over time , collected it on more and more people			0
corporate surveillance has been on a path from minimal to maximal information			1
corporations always collected information on everyone they could , but in the past they did n't collect very much of it and only held it as long as necessary			0
when surveillance information was expensive to collect and store , companies made do with as little as possible			2
telephone companies collected long - distance calling information because they needed it for billing purposes			0
credit cards collected only the information about their customers ' transactions that they needed for billing			0
stores hardly ever collected information about their customers , maybe some personal preferences , or name - and - address for advertising purposes			0
even @entity48 , back in the beginning , collected far less information about its users than it does today			2
as technology improved , corporations were able to collect more			0
as the cost of data storage became cheaper , they were able to save more data and for a longer time			2
and as big data analysis tools became more powerful , it became profitable to save more			2
today , almost everything is being saved by someone -- probably forever			2
internet companies like @entity48 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 collect everything we do online at their sites			0
third - party cookies allow those companies , and others , to collect data on us wherever we are on the @entity74			2
store affinity cards allow merchants to track our purchases			0
@entity78 and aerial surveillance combined with automatic face recognition allow companies to track our movements ; so does your cell phone			2
the internet will facilitate even more surveillance , by more corporations for more purposes			2
on the government side , surveillance has been on a path from individually targeted to broadly collected			1
when surveillance was manual and expensive , it could only be justified in extreme cases			2
the warrant process limited police surveillance , and resource restraints and the risk of discovery limited national intelligence surveillance			1
specific individuals were targeted for surveillance , and maximal information was collected on them alone			2
as technology improved , the government was able to implement ever - broadening surveillance			1
the @entity107 could surveil groups -- the @entity111 government , the @entity113 diplomatic corps , etc. -- not just individuals			1
eventually , they could spy on entire communications trunks			0
now , instead of watching one person , the @entity107 can monitor " three hops " away from that person -- an ever widening network of people not directly connected to the person under surveillance			1
using sophisticated tools , the @entity107 can surveil broad swaths of the @entity74 and phone network			1
governments have always used their authority to piggyback on corporate surveillance			1
why should they go through the trouble of developing their own surveillance programs when they could just ask corporations for the data ? for example we just learned that the @entity107 collects e-mail , im and social networking contact lists for millions of internet users worldwide			1
but as corporations started collecting more information on populations , governments started demanding that data			2
through @entity147 , the @entity146 can surveil huge groups of people without obtaining a warrant			0
through secret agreements , the @entity107 can monitor the entire @entity74 and telephone networks			1
this is a huge part of the public - private surveillance partnership			0
the result of all this is we 're now living in a world where both corporations and governments have us all under pretty much constant surveillance			1
data is a byproduct of the information society			0
every interaction we have with a computer creates a transaction record , and we interact with computers hundreds of times a day			0
even if we do n't use a computer -- buying something in person with cash , say -- the merchant uses a computer , and the data flows into the same system			0
everything we do leaves a data shadow , and that shadow is constantly under surveillance			1
data is also a byproduct of information society socialization , whether it be e-mail , instant messages or conversations on @entity64			0
conversations that used to be ephemeral are now recorded , and we are all leaving digital footprints wherever we go			0
@entity189 's law has made computing cheaper			0
all of us have made computing ubiquitous			0
and because computing produces data , and that data equals surveillance , we have created a world of ubiquitous surveillance			1
now we need to figure out what to do about it			0
this is more than reining in the @entity107 or fining a corporation for the occasional data abuse			1
we need to decide whether our data is a shared societal resource , a part of us that is inherently ours by right , or a private good to be bought and sold			1
writing in @entity211 , @entity210 said that " information is power , and the necessary corollary is that privacy is freedom			0
" how this interplay between power and freedom play out in the information age is still to be determined			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			1

@entity223 : historically , surveillance was difficult ; now it 's become much easier
@entity223 : government and corporate surveillance used to be very different
he says today @entity107 can piggyback on corporate surveillance ; they 're like partners
@entity223 : we need to decide whether data is a societal resource or a commodity
