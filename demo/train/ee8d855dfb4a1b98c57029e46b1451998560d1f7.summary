@entity0 -- @entity2 in @entity0 say they are breathing a sigh of relief now that the @entity6 secretary of state has ruled that the @entity9 @entity8 candidate will stay on the ballot in november even though he dropped out			1
it 's a case of political whiplash for national republicans , who just hours earlier scrambled to send strategists to @entity6 when it suddenly became a head - to - head race between incumbent @entity2 @entity17 and an independent candidate with libertarian views , who would likely pull @entity2 votes from @entity17			1
the matchup appeared to make it harder for the @entity2 to seize the @entity8 majority			0
now a @entity2 strategist tells @entity1 that @entity2 believe keeping @entity27 @entity26 on the ballot is " enormous " because he was only getting 30 % of the vote when he was actively campaigning			1
@entity2 predict the @entity27 will still get about 10 - 25 % of the vote on @entity32 , making it easier for @entity17 to beat independent candidate @entity34			1
the @entity36 , which works to get @entity2 elected to the @entity8 , was already dispatching veteran @entity2 strategist @entity37 to @entity6 , a @entity2 source tells @entity1			1
the source called it just the first move to try to help bolster @entity17 ' campaign , which national @entity2 worry is lackluster and ill - equipped to run an unexpectedly competitive campaign			2
@entity2 had also enlisted help from former sen. @entity44 , the longtime senator from @entity6 and a former @entity8 majority leader , who was already scheduled in the state this week			1
a source close to @entity44 tells @entity1 he is playing the role as " super consultant " to @entity17 , an old friend			0
the @entity8 race in @entity6 just got more interesting 5 @entity8 races to watch in 2014 republicans were moving fast because of the national importance of the race in the @entity2 quest to regain control of the @entity8 in november			2
the @entity2 has to pick up six seats to take over the @entity8			0
their advantage has been that they are only playing defense in two states : @entity61 and @entity62			0
adding @entity6 to the list has many implications , most immediately with money			0
after 30 years in @entity8 , @entity66 tries to run as ' candidate of change ' @entity2 resources are already spread thin because there are so many neck - and - neck races where they are spending campaign cash -- mostly where they are playing offense trying to pick up @entity9 seats everywhere from @entity76 to @entity77 to @entity78 and @entity79 and beyond			0
when @entity17 narrowly won a @entity2 primary race earlier this year , republicans thought he would have relatively smooth sailing towards re-election			2
@entity6 is so conservative , it has only been represented by @entity2 senators for three quarters of a century			2
@entity87 chamber ramps up efforts in key @entity8 race but then @entity34 began to climb in the polls			0
the three - way race was already making things tougher for @entity17 , but on wednesday night , @entity26 abruptly withdrew , paving the way for a head to head matchup between @entity17 and @entity34 , an independent running on a libertarian platform			1
@entity2 strategists tell @entity1 they had to drag @entity17 over the finish line for his @entity2 primary race , and they hope he understands that he has to work harder than before to win re-election .			0

@entity6 secretary of state rules @entity27 must stay on ballot even though he dropped out
@entity2 *feared* with no @entity27 , an independent could beat incumbent @entity17
@entity108 is running on a libertarian platform , which could take votes from @entity17
