-- it 's well known the fashion industry is one of the toughest to break into			2
to conform to the traditional stereotype of a model you need to be skinny , stunning and have legs that go on forever , right ? try telling that to @entity9 -- she 's breaking all the rules while sashaying down the catwalk as @entity13 's first albino model			1
" i was being tenacious and saying ' no , wait a minute			0
this is a different representation of what @entity13 beauty is , ' " @entity9 tells @entity0			1
" you 're told that a black child should be brown - skinned , but what do you then call a girl like myself ? i 'm not tall either			1
but there i was modeling with the likes of your @entity22 's , your famous models that have really done well			2
" in 1999 , @entity9 was just 13 years old when she was first approached to do a five - page shoot for a youth magazine aiming to showcase how the @entity13 fashion landscape would change with the turn of the millennium			1
it was her first taste of fashion , but she got the bug			0
yet it would n't be until she finished her high school education and entered college ( at the behest of her mother ) that @entity9 found herself in front of a camera again			1
redefining beauty the move kickstarted her career and soon the @entity13 student was staring back at herself from glossy magazine pages and gliding down runways at high - profile events , like @entity46			1
" i was defying everything about what society says defines a model			0
i 'm basically saying ' ok , let 's teach our kids a different definition of beauty , or a definition that 's always been there but has just always been disregarded			1
" albinism is an inherited condition caused by a lack of melanin , a pigment in skin , hair and eyes			0
while it is fairly common globally -- one in every 17,000 people are born with some form of the genetic disorder -- albinos across @entity13 are often subject to discrimination and even , in some countries , hunted and killed because of their appearance			1
" people with albinism are often not given the opportunity to get into such industries because we 're not known as extroverts , we 're not given a chance to be identified in society as people who have the potential to represent something , " she says			0
identity crisis but @entity9 does n't just have to live with the unspoken threat of discrimination hanging in the air			2
born in @entity92 , the feisty , young model has , at times , struggled with her identity			0
the 28 - year - old explains : " @entity13 has a history of apartheid , where race is such a big segregation			1
how do you then place yourself ? you are a girl who is born in a black society : the township			0
and now you have to fit into a world where , you 're told : this is black , this is white and you 're in a country that is constantly fighting these aspects			0
it 's something that is not easy because people try and place you and identify you in a specific way			0
" cementing her status as a household name , she also spends one day a week filming a current affairs talk show with fellow @entity13 television personalities @entity117 and comedian @entity118			2
participation in the show allows @entity121 to reveal more of her personality to the country , and to show she 's more than just a clothes horse			0
though she 's not even 30 , @entity9 is already thinking about her legacy			1
" i will teach through the things that i do			0
( @entity129 ) plan for the future is just to grow myself as a brand and as an entity : to touch the world in different places and to be able to be a huge representative for @entity13			2

traditional stereotype of model is tall , skinny and *aesthetically* *attractive*
@entity13 @entity9 is making waves as the *continent* 's first albino model
