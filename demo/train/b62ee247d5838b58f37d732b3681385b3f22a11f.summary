" having taken @entity5 's assurances in good faith at the outset of the inquiry he set up , i am merely one among many who feel duped and angry in its wake , " she wrote			1
" i thought long and hard about the possible consequences to my family of giving evidence and finally decided to do so because i have made every possible attempt to protect my children 's privacy under the present system , and failed			0
" @entity2 is concerned that members of the public who do not have the money to fight the press in the courts , over such abuses as invasion of privacy or libel , will continue to suffer			1
" those who have suffered the worst , most painful and least justifiable kinds of mistreatment at the hands of the press , people who have become newsworthy because of the press 's own errors or through unspeakable private tragedy , are those least likely to be able to defend themselves or to seek proper redress , " she said			2
" without statutory underpinning @entity22 's recommendations will not work			0
we will be left with yet another voluntary system from which the press can walk away			0

in his report , @entity22 said he had no desire to jeopardize the freedom of the press , which he acknowledged plays a " vital " role in safeguarding the public interest , but that changes are needed to tackle abuses			0
the @entity6 press has ignored its own code of conduct on " far too many occasions over the last decade , " causing " real hardship " and sometimes wreaking " havoc with the lives of innocent people , " @entity22 said			0
