imagine carrying a bowling ball between your legs that weighs close to 200 pounds			0
if that image is too much to stomach , continue reading with caution			0
@entity6 , 49 , spent more than four years with this extra burden before having surgery to repair the damage from a rare medical condition called scrotal lymphedema			1
when doctors placed the swollen mass they had cut from @entity6 's scrotum on the scale , it weighed 132 pounds			1
that 's not counting the fluid or smaller pieces of tissue the surgeons had also removed from the @entity22 man			2
" there are a lot of people that will look and laugh and stare in shock and awe and amazement , " @entity6 says as he walks down the street in a preview for @entity26 's upcoming show " @entity27 with the 132 - @entity28			1
" the one - hour special airs monday at 9 p.m. et / @entity35 " it 's tough to deal with it , you know , because essentially , this is a sort of living and breathing freak show			2
" it began in 2008 , @entity6 told @entity26 , when he awoke to a shooting pain in his testicles			1
the tissue around his penis soon began to swell , eventually growing at an estimated rate of 3 pounds per month			2
one doctor told @entity6 that it might be necessary to castrate him to fix the problem ; others told him that he would probably die on the operating table			1
and the cost of the surgery alone would be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars			0
after @entity6 appeared on the @entity56 radio show , appealing for help , a fellow scrotal lymphedema sufferer referred him to dr. @entity58 , who offered to do the surgery for free			1
@entity58 , director of the @entity60 at the @entity61 , specializes in urethral and penile reconstruction surgery			0
although the headline of @entity26 's special is catchy , scrotal lymphedema is a very real condition , @entity58 said			1
he hopes media attention surrounding the show will encourage other men with the problem to seek treatment			0
here are some more answers about this condition : what is scrotal lymphedema ? @entity77 lymphedema , also known as scrotal elephantiasis , is a " massive enlargement " of the scrotum due to thickening of tissue and accumulation of fluid , @entity58 said			1
what causes it ? outside @entity87 , scrotal lymphedema is often caused by a parasitic infection called lymphatic filariasis that 's spread by mosquitoes			1
" thread - like worms " lodge themselves in the lymphatic system , according to the @entity93 , where they can interfere with a person 's immune system			1
but lymphatic filariasis is virtually unheard - of in the @entity99 , @entity58 said			1
most cases of scrotal lymphedema here are caused by blockages in the lymphatic vessels that prevent fluid from draining from the area			1
doctors are unsure what causes this blockage ; in @entity6 's case , @entity58 believes it was an injury or trauma to his scrotum			1
what are the symptoms ? the most obvious symptom is a large scrotum ; this can range in size from a grapefruit to a basketball			2
but the mass does n't " max out " at any particular size , @entity58 said			0
it will keep growing until the patient seeks treatment			1
@entity6 's scrotum was the largest @entity58 had ever seen			1
" ( @entity6 ) did n't report that he was always in pain , but i think the biggest problem is that the sheer size of the mass made it very uncomfortable for him , " the surgeon said			2
" it 's like lifting weights to take a step			2
" @entity6 's penis was " buried " about a foot under his skin , @entity58 said , but fully functional			1
a tunnel of sorts had formed from the tip to the top layer of his swollen skin , allowing @entity6 to urinate without assistance			2
how common is scrotal lymphedema ? it 's rare , especially in the @entity99			1
definite numbers are difficult to come by , and the condition may be underdiagnosed due to physicians ' lack of awareness , @entity58 said			0
many patients with the condition are also obese and are simply instructed by their doctors to lose weight			0
how do you treat it ? surgery is usually the best option to remove the swollen tissue , @entity58 said			0
a surgeon who specializes in this type of procedure will cut a t - shape in the mass , identify the penis and testicles to make sure they are n't harmed and then excise the excess tissue			0
the surgeon will then use undamaged tissue to cover the penis and scrotum			0
how is @entity6 doing now ? @entity6 is walking again and enjoying life , @entity58 said			2
he 'll need a follow - up surgery to remove some additional skin that was damaged by his condition			0
@entity58 will perform a skin graft to cover the penis and scrotum			0
um , what if i think i have it ? if you are experiencing the symptoms noted above , see a doctor as soon as possible			0
ask for a referral to a specialist if your primary care physician is unfamiliar with these types of conditions			0
an unusually large scrotum can have a variety of causes , @entity58 said			0
one of the most common is a hernia , in which a small part of the intestines enters the scrotum			0
another cause is fluid buildup on one side of a man 's body between the testicle and the skin ; this is called hydrocele			2
all are treatable and usually not life - threatening unless left too long .			0
