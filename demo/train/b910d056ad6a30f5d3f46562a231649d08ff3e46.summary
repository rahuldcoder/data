" the video is concerning , " @entity11 police capt. @entity48 said			1
" we realize what the perception of the video ( is )			2
however , we ask that the public be patient and allow the process to play itself out			0
the @entity58 state attorney 's office is going to investigate this first , and upon completion of that , we 'll conduct our own thorough and unbiased investigation			1
" the man in the video has pleaded no contest to the charge			1

" i 'm pissed off , " he said			0
" most of the police officers around here are very reasonable , good people who just have a job to do			0
this guy , i do n't know what his problem is			0
" the second video , shot monday by attorney @entity77 at the @entity78 , shows @entity58 sheriff 's deputy @entity79 dragging a handcuffed , screaming woman down a hallway by her leg restraints			1

after she cursed at @entity79 while trying to leave the courtroom , @entity79 wrote in his narrative , " i immediately pulled her out of the courtroom , by her waist - chain			2

she clutches onto a sign as he attempts to pull her through a doorway			0
" it reminded me of the @entity125 when they would rope these guys and drag them from a horse by their feet -- but this was actually metal shackles , " @entity77 said			0
" when i first came out i did n't know if this woman had attacked somebody or needed to be on the ground like that , but i 'm telling you , within seconds , it became apparent that she was just completely and totally mentally ill , and this is not how you do things in 2015			2
" he likened her treatment to " torture			0
" @entity77 's wife , @entity143 , the chief assistant public defender in charge of the division that represents the dragged woman , saw the whole incident and called the deputy 's behavior " a huge disgrace			1
" " she was n't just dragged a couple feet			0
she was dragged throughout most of the third floor of the courthouse , and it was not necessary and it was really just egregious conduct , " she said			0
" to treat one of the most fragile , vulnerable people in society that way , there was no reason for it			0
" the woman , who has been in jail since december 30 on a probation violation , had gone before a judge for a competency hearing prior to the dragging incident , @entity143 said			1
she 's been examined again since the incident , she said			2
" we 've had two doctors that have evaluated her and , in their opinion , she is not competent to proceed , meaning that her mental health is so fragile that she ca n't go forward with the charges right now , " @entity143 said			0
" it was disturbing , to say the least , " @entity77 told @entity3			0
" this is somebody who was obviously mentally ill and it was like torture			0
how can you do this to another human being , particularly one who 's mentally ill ? " @entity79 is on restricted duty pending the outcome of an investigation			1
