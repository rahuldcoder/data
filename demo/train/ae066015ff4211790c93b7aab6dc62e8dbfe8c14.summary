-- @entity2 's 3 - 0 win over @entity3 in the @entity5 final brought to an end an event that was designed as a test run for the @entity10 hosts			1
it was a tournament that was permeated by social unrest , with protesters partly unhappy over the degree of public money devoted to the staging of the @entity10			1
@entity0 looks at five things we learned from the event			0
@entity20 is the real deal @entity20 has been touted as the latest in a line of @entity24 superstars that stretches all the way back to the great @entity26 , but outside @entity2 many were beginning to believe the hype surrounding the young star was just that			1
prior to the @entity5 his performances for the national team had been lacklustre , particular in the 2 - 2 draw against @entity33 in april , when he was singled out for jeers by @entity2 's own fans			1
while most would argue that he 's in no position to judge , @entity38 midfielder @entity37 's @entity36 likening @entity20 to @entity39 , and something rather unpleasant relating to cats , seemed to sum up the views of many @entity45 observers			1
following the @entity24 's $ 75 million transfer to @entity47 -- just before the tournament kicked off -- some were even suggesting the @entity51 club had been fleeced by @entity24 side @entity52			1
not any more : this was no tantalizing glimpse of what @entity57 fans might be watching next season , it was incontrovertible proof of what @entity20 can bring			1
the 21 - year - old produced a string of vibrant , flamboyant , but above all effective performances throughout the tournament , his goals and guile serving notice that he is every inch a superstar			1
time may be up for @entity72 and company after winning friends at @entity76 , the @entity74 continued to show that the days of " catenaccio " are long gone , with some fast attacking football			0
@entity74 's run in the tournament was certainly invigorating , lurching from near disaster in an extraordinary first - half capitulation against @entity83 , to a sublime ( albeit goalless ) first - half domination of @entity3			1
in the end they were well worth their third place , but it could and possibly should have been more			0
@entity72 is widely and justifiably regarded as one of the world 's finest goalkeepers ; yet his penalty saves in the third place play - off against @entity95 masked his culpability in goals conceded at key moments in the tournament			1
this was not the dominant , steely - eyed @entity72 of old -- particularly against @entity2 , where he looked anything but solid			1
likewise , there are other old hands whose time in the famous blue shirt may be nearing its end			0
given @entity110 's reluctance to start @entity112 's exciting midfielder @entity111 , major surgery is unlikely			0
the @entity114 national side has always been resistant to change , as its ageing spine suggests , but it may need to pick up the pace of its evolution			0
the likes of @entity72 and the peerless @entity119 may have one more big tournament in them , but @entity110 would do well to blood some fresh talent in the meantime , just in case -- especially given the physical demands next year 's @entity10 will present			1
protests are a wake - up call to @entity128 and @entity2 for a country that is synonymous with football , there were times during this tournament when @entity2 seemed to have fallen well and truly out of love with the game -- or at least , with @entity128 and the @entity24 government 's interpretation of what a @entity10 should look like			1
as simmering social unrest threatened to boil into something more serious , the tournament 's detractors grew in volume and number			2
even former star striker @entity145 joined a critical chorus that cited ticket prices , infrastructure costs and a questionable legacy as reasons why the @entity5 , and next year 's @entity10 , were bad for @entity2			1
in anticipation of trouble , a reported 10,000 police were on duty in @entity155 ahead of @entity2 's clash with @entity3 , but in the end protests were relatively low - key			1
following their team 's emphatic triumph over the world and @entity45 champions , crowds spilled out onto the street and into a carnival atmosphere			0
clearly this story is not over , and there is much work to do ; for now , however , football 's primacy has been restored			0
in fact there was much cause for optimism on the pitch			0
this was a well - deserved win from a team that looks to be gaining in stature , and the atmosphere inside the @entity180 for the final was profoundly imposing			2
of course @entity2 won the @entity182 before limping out in the quarterfinals in @entity184 ; but this time they will be at home			2
the @entity10 will be a tougher test ; but do n't bet against them			2
@entity3 needs a re-boot finally , after a seemingly interminable period of dominance , @entity3 's champions look to have been found out			2
for clues as to how , it is hard to see beyond the @entity194			0
@entity74 really should have beaten the @entity195 after playing them off the park for significant chunks of their semi-final ; @entity2 's 3 - 0 defeat of the world champions was a muscular and ruthless final execution			1
both owed much to the approaches of @entity205 and @entity206 in their @entity208 defeats of @entity47 and @entity209			0
@entity3 were hustled and hassled , with attempts to impose their intricate passing game met by fiercely committed opponents , closing them down until the @entity45 simply folded			2
@entity213 only won the golden boot because of his goals against @entity217 's part - timers			0
@entity218 and @entity219 are still fabulously creative , but elsewhere @entity3 's weak links were exploited with a kind of physicality this team now seems incapable of countering			2
drained of confidence , or possibly just appetite , they looked listless and in dire need of fresh ideas			0
the sight of a defender , @entity231 , taking a penalty that could have brought them back into the final spoke volumes			0
true @entity2 had had an extra day of rest before the final , but the mask of invincibility has slipped ; @entity3 has 12 months to work out how to set it back in place			1
the @entity5 comes of age in theory at least , the @entity5 is the unloved second cousin of the @entity10 , the @entity243 and the @entity244			1
traditionally these games are seen by the cynics as little more than jumped up exhibition matches -- a mere aperitif before the main meal of the @entity10			2
by and large , no one really cares who wins			0
this time , however , something seemed to click			0
maybe it was the location			0
@entity2 may have some serious issues to confront , but there is something about the host country that elevated this tournament onto a different plane			1
in football terms , this is about as educated as any crowd can get			0
the enthusiastic way in which local fans adopted teams such as @entity83 , @entity95 , @entity217 and @entity74 conveyed atmosphere and meaning to fixtures where normally none would exist , and more than made up for the absence of traveling support			0
the outcome , for the neutrals at least , was first class entertainment			0
@entity2 2013 served up some of the most memorable international games of recent memory , played in front of passionate crowds in some spectacular arenas			2
if @entity2 2014 can pick up where this rehearsal left off , then we are truly in for a treat .			2
