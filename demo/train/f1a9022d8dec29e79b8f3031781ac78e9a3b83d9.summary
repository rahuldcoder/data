@entity6 as @entity5 close to @entity1 recover from their @entity3 celebrations and flip their calendar to 2015 , many will notice a seemingly unimportant date is fast approaching			1
for months , @entity9 @entity5 have pointed to early january -- particularly jan. 15 -- as a symbolic date for @entity12 's presidential aspirations			1
in conversations with one another and at strategy sessions about a possible 2016 run , former aides and confidants have quietly said that if @entity12 does n't say " no " to running by the start of 2015 , she is a go for 2016			2
" if she has n't said ' no ' by january , it will be a sign she is running , " said one longtime @entity12 friend at last month 's @entity23 strategy session in @entity24			1

" if she has n't said something after that date , people should assume she is running			2
" the strategist , who said this was the general sense among people close to @entity12 , added , " she has two weeks to say she is n't running			1
" the reason is simple : @entity12 has , so far , sucked up all the oxygen in the @entity5 ' 2016 conversation			0
if she lets that continue well into 2015 and then decides to back out , she puts her party -- which already has a thin bench of second tier candidates -- in a tough position			0
while chatter about former sen. @entity62 , sen. @entity63 and vice president @entity64 have bubbled up throughout late 2014 , neither have caught fire in the polls			0
