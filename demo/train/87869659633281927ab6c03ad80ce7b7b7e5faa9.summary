after paying five homeless people outside his studio in @entity3 to help chew 700 pieces of bubble gum , @entity0 began to wonder what he had undertaken in the name of art. " well , it certainly took longer than i imagined it would , and they thought it would , too " he recalls			1
after two days of aching jaws , the potent mix of gum , spittle and resin went to create one of @entity0 's larger - than - life sculptures ; a bright green figure that is part tribal warrior , part horror flick monster , but all @entity0 's imagination			1
it is now starting to turn brown as the sugar in the gum oxidizes , but @entity0 is still turning his wild machinations of surreal , twisted biomorphic figures into sculptures and paintings , and is one of a group of contemporary artists from the @entity34 turning heads with a vibrancy and unique @entity34 vision			1
awash with tubes of bright acrylic paint , @entity0 's studio in the @entity40 area of @entity3 has been his main base for around 10 years and is situated just a few minutes away from the stadium where @entity46 and @entity47 had their " thriller in @entity3 " bout in 1975			1
working on two new pieces for this month 's @entity52 while sipping industrial strength coffee , @entity0 admits that while his attitude to his work has n't really altered in a decade , local artists are seemingly starting to punch above their weight			1
" things have changed a lot in terms of financial gain and artistic gain			0
for new artists , they have a thing about doing it in the international scene or being represented			1
now it 's a career that has to be strategized , " he says			0
" in @entity3 there used to be more artist run galleries			1
now big galleries are here and looking for the new artist that wants to sell for big money			0
every week now there 's like three openings , before it used to be one show per month			0
" it 's a long way from the 34 - year - old 's life when he graduated from the @entity83			2
back then he could n't afford paint so spent days drawing comic strips ( one of which has gained a cult following in the @entity34 and @entity89 ) or taking illustration jobs to pay the bills			2
joining with friends and contemporaries he also ran artist spaces for impromptu exhibitions			0
since then he 's moved on to feature in joint exhibitions in @entity97 and prominent solo shows including one in @entity100 in 2010			0
inspired by an explosive mix of comic art , pop culture and gore-fest films , @entity0 also retains a strong @entity34 flavor in his art , drawing on everything from jeepney art , turbulent politics and the almost inescapable impact of religion in @entity34 society			1
" we 've been occupied and colonized by @entity117 and @entity118 so most of the artists here contemplate on that concept or hang - ups from it , especially the @entity123 influence that we get from school age upwards , " he says			2
playing with religious imagery can still cause huge controversy in the @entity34			2
last year a collage by artist @entity128 at the @entity129 of the @entity34 depicted @entity130 with a wooden penis glued to his face			2
it was condemned by church groups and even attracted the ire of former first lady @entity136			0
the resulting furor led to the exhibition being closed			0
@entity0 admits to gleefully prodding the country 's cultural soft spots when he was younger with a 2001 piece that mixed in @entity130 and @entity142 , but thinks @entity128 was just unlucky			1
" he was the center of the whole nation 's tensions			0
when i started i was like that , now i 'm not so scandalous with my work ; it 's more like you 're young and full of angst , and you 're very idealistic			2
" if you 're dealing with religion , it 's very sad because people , priests and politicians will condemn you if you touch on that sensibility			0
you can do it , but it can become a circus			0
" it 's fine if you do it just for art people , but for the common people , still not that many go to art exhibition			2
you need that sensation for people to go			0
" if the public 's tastes are not so catholic in the @entity34 , art collectors are starting to wake up to the breadth and diversity of work by contemporary @entity34 artists			1
last month a painting by @entity34 artist @entity178 entitled " @entity179 " sold at @entity180 in @entity97 for $ 1.1 million , making it the first piece by a contemporary @entity184 artist to fetch more than $ 1 million			2
" if @entity178 's work is going for over $ 1million , and the likes of ( established 19th century painter ) @entity190 could n't meet its reserve price , there 's something going on ( in the art market ) , " says independent curator and @entity0 's partner @entity186			1
next door to @entity0 's studio is a fabrication workshop run by @entity197 , where @entity0 's latest projects - thrones made of fiberglass bones and twisted totem polls - are being made			1
a gold mine of curios and industrial oddities , it 's also a hub for local artists , from those fresh out of art school to longer - serving artists like @entity212			1
" i 've been around since the 1980s			0
@entity34 started in a struggle , now it 's the new generation 's chance , and they 're smart , " says @entity212			1
" but for the old generation like me , i 'll keep going , and i 'm happy if someone now wants to pay more for my art. " with an increasing interest in the work of @entity0 and his contemporaries like @entity223 and predecessors like @entity225 , has come a desire from collectors to know where they come from , says @entity229 , director of @entity52 , " it 's relatively early days for the international profile of art from the @entity34 , " says @entity229			1
" but it is becoming more and more the case that collectors are willing to engage with artists from a wide variety of cultural and aesthetic backgrounds			0
" among the sparks of spot - welding and smell of resin in the workshop , @entity0 is content to continue to mix things up in his own work regardless of the changing tastes of collectors or galleries			1
" i do n't know what i 'm doing ; it 's the challenge			0
that 's the reason i do art : to keep challenging myself and saying this is what i want to do			0
