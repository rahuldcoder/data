-- " i took all my @entity3 posters down before you came over , " declares @entity5 , leaning against the arched doorframe of her @entity8 dining room			1
@entity0 : 21 imaginary tv couples we wish were real @entity5 's delivery is thoroughly deadpan , but anyone even mildly familiar with the 39 - year - old would know the claim could n't be dripping with more sarcasm			2
after all , along with co-star @entity17 , @entity18 -- founding member of riot grrrl cult band @entity16 and , more recently , @entity20 -- has made a second career out of portraying a constituent of the kale - eating , craft - beer - drinking , lumberjack - shirt - wearing , jewelry - making crowd on " @entity26			1
" @entity0 : what 's behind @entity26 's comedy chemistry ? while the locally filmed show , which returned for a fourth season on @entity32 in february , has made the @entity33 native something of a hometown hero in her adopted city , she 's quick to point out that @entity8 was merely a convenient backdrop for the series			1
" portlandia is n't as much about a place as it is about a state of mind , " says @entity5			0
" it 's about people who like to feel special , who like to believe that this certain thing has been tailor - made just for them , of which i 'm definitely guilty too , at times			0
" @entity0 : 9 tv actresses who deserve a raise given the show 's penchant for incredibly nuanced observations of hipster culture -- municipal recycling guidelines are enough fodder for an entire sketch -- it should come as no surprise that @entity5 was equally committed to detail when it came to decorating the 1912 bungalow she bought in the trendy @entity59 neighborhood 10 years ago after touring extensively			2
@entity0 : a different way of thinking about lena dunham 's nudity in ' girls ' @entity5 filled the place with sentimental , one - of - a - kind finds : a taxidermied weasel once owned by @entity67 sits on the mantel ; ' 50s - era coastal landscapes by various local artists fill the walls ; and a record collectionâ € ” which , in @entity5 's case , is several thousand vinyls strong and meticulously alphabetized by artistâ € ” testifies that yes , this is a hipster home			0
@entity0 : 21 vintage photos of hollywood couples on the red carpet all in all , the spread is not unlike the one @entity5 's @entity26 alter ego inhabits			1
hard - core fans may recognize @entity5 's real - life mutts from the now infamous episode about dog parks			2
@entity17 , whom she met in 2003 at a " @entity86 " after - party , is clearly her partner in crime in real life , too : the comedian , who rents a house nearby during filming , texts @entity5 in the middle of her elle shoot to let her know that @entity95 has died			1
( a fellow musician , @entity17 is also a frequent guest in @entity5 's basement -- a soundproof practice space tricked out with a loungy @entity100 sofa and no fewer than five guitars			1
) @entity0 : 11 items every fashionable woman should have by 30 of course , inhabiting the blurred line between reality and fiction can have its downsides			0
a particular source of consternation for @entity110 is one of the show 's most famous skits -- " put a bird on it " -- which depicts an artisan couple with a compulsive knack for putting a cutesy bird on virtually everything they make			2
" now i go into stores and see things i want to buy with birds on it , and i ca n't , because i 'm too self - conscious , " @entity5 says			0
" the other day , i was in a store and saw a cute dress with birds on it and i was like , ' no , i just ca n't			0

*rocker* turned " @entity26 " star @entity5 shows off her @entity8 bungalow
a basement full of guitars is a favorite spot for @entity110 and co-star @entity17
@entity5 is burned out on cutsy bird *silhouettes* , thanks to an episode of " @entity26 "
