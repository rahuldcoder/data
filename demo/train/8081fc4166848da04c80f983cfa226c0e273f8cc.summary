-- there is mounting evidence that the electoral threat from the tea party is fading			1
in the power struggle between the @entity4 faction of the @entity8 and the " establishment , " the establishment is winning			1
party primaries are an imperfect way to measure the direction in politics			2
the news from one week can be overshadowed by what happens a few weeks later			0
primaries are just snapshots of the political landscape at a given moment			0
but at least this week the news for tea party advocates was not good			1
the primaries are providing evidence as to how much of a threat the @entity8 leadership really faces when opponents attempt to unseat them for moving too far to the center			2
house speaker @entity29 faced a twin tea party challenge from republicans who claim he has been too willing to compromise			1
the @entity4 campaign in his district picked up some steam after the speaker made disparaging remarks about colleagues who were holding up the immigration bill			2
@entity4 candidates @entity40 and @entity41 both went after him			0
but @entity29 enjoyed an easy victory tuesday , putting aside speculation that discontent with his recent statements about immigration and the budget might cause him problems			1
there was never a genuine threat that he would be unseated , but a strong showing by his opponents would have been enough to send some shock waves to @entity54			0
a more serious contest is taking place in @entity58 , where on may 20 , senate minority leader @entity59 faces off against tea party @entity8 @entity60			1
thus far , all the evidence suggests that @entity63 will do just fine in the primary			2
the primaries are also telling us something about the status of immigration as an issue in the @entity8			1
the immigration reform legislation that passed the @entity72 has been held up by a faction of @entity75 tea party @entity8 , equaling about 30 to 40 members , who have been steadfast in their refusal to let a bill pass			1
the opposition as well as threats of political harm made against anyone who dares speak in favor of reform has been a major barrier to passing legislation			2
yet the evidence is still thin that taking a hard - line , anti-immigration stance is the only way for a @entity8 to survive			2
as @entity94 recently noted , @entity93 founder @entity92 's pro-reform group @entity91 has argued that the threat has been exaggerated , pointing out that few @entity8 who have supported immigration reform have lost			1
@entity8 establishment 1 , tea party 0 after @entity72 primary " purely from a quantitative standpoint , the percentage of @entity8 primary voters who are hostile to what we might call ... all manner of immigration reform is pretty low , " said @entity100 , a pollster working for @entity92 's organization			1
two @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 , survived their primaries despite working on the immigration bill in the @entity75			0
in his primary in march , @entity110 won with more than 80 % of the vote			0
this week in @entity117 , rep. @entity116 defeated @entity118 , a former currency trader , who targeted her for support for more liberal policies toward immigrants			0
" if an individual wants to come to this country to work , to provide for his family and to contribute to his community , he should be allowed to do so , " she wrote			0
@entity126 attacked her for supporting " de facto amnesty			0
the victory provides more evidence that proponents of immigration reform , and there are many , can move forward with legislation and survive			1
as one expert at @entity137 told @entity0 , " if the primaries in spring and summer show immigration is not that big an issue with activists , then @entity8 will feel they can go out on the limb and support reform			1
" the final lesson tuesday has to do with the organizational and financial muscle of the tea party			1
is it mostly bark , but no bite ? this has been an issue that has dogged the tea party since it emerged in 2010			1
can these activists really match the money and resources of the establishment ? in certain campaigns , establishment organizations , allied with business , have been putting substantial amounts of money to shape the outcome			0
they spent big to support conservative candidates who would be viable in the general election against @entity163			0
in @entity117 , the primary between @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 for the @entity8 candidacy in the race for the @entity72 seat currently held by @entity171 has been the center of attention			2
sen. @entity174 of @entity58 traveled to @entity117 to announce his support for @entity167			0
groups such as @entity177 -- @entity179 's organization -- have invested millions to back their candidate , @entity165			2
once again , the establishment won			0
@entity165 secured well over the 40 % threshold he needed to avoid some kind of runoff			0
his victory offers more fodder for those who have argued that tea party organizations such as the @entity190 and the @entity191 have been ineffective , squandering resources by spending more on fund - raising and direct mail than on their candidates			1
@entity197 , who had worked for the @entity198 , even downplayed their ability to shape the grass roots			0
" their influence in terms of on - the - ground activity and spending money is greatly overstated			0
... their influence has generally been in the echo chamber , with talk radio and blogs			0
" it 's important that this trend should not be seen as a victory of " moderate " republicans over " far right " @entity109			0
the truth is that the entire @entity8 has shifted to the right , and these are all contests between different factions of conservative republicanism rather than a true ideological war within the party			2
the tea party still has a lot to prove			1
this week 's primaries only made its case that much harder			0
there are still opportunities for tea party @entity8 to show they can deliver a punch on the campaign trail			1
but more poor showings at the polls will continue to strengthen the @entity8 establishment in its effort to quash the tea party as a political power in its caucus .			1

@entity240 : in battle between tea party and establishment , the tea party is losing
he says *mainstream* candidates such as @entity29 , @entity63 not in *danger* of being unseated
@entity240 says tuesday 's vote showed the power of establishment @entity8 groups
he says the results could help tip the *balance* toward immigration reform legislation
