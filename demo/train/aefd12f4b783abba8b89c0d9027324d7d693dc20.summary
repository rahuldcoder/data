-- the @entity2 is asking countries and donors around the world to send urgent aid to the victims of the flooding in @entity9 , one - fifth of which is now under water			1
the aid requested is only half the amount the world body asked for in the aftermath of @entity16 's devastating earthquake this year -- but twice as many @entity9 are in dire need of help			1
the money poured in for survivors of @entity16 's quake , but the funds are only slowly trickling in for people left homeless or ill in the wake of widespread flooding in the @entity27 nation			1
is it because the earthquake was such a sudden shock , destroying huge chunks of cities and villages within a matter of 35 horrifying seconds while @entity9 's floods evolved over three weeks ? that 's part of the reason , said @entity39 of the @entity40 and @entity40			1
" floods are always more difficult to raise money for than dramatic seismic events that happen suddenly , because the scale of it only creeps up on people , " @entity39 said			0
" however , this is a totally exceptional flood			0
i have seen quite a number of floods in my time , but never anything remotely approaching this scale			0
" much also depends on media coverage and the images that permeate television and computer screens			0
in @entity16 , pictures of the collapsed presidential palace and vast tent cities tugged at hearts			1
" it 's very hard to compare disasters , " said @entity61 , spokesman for the @entity62 ( @entity62 )			0
" @entity16 was instant , extremely visual			1
there was an outpouring of sympathy			0
@entity9 has been a slowly evolving disaster			1
" though it is far from truth , the suffering in @entity9 appears more muted than when dump trucks carried thousands of crushed bodies to mass graves outside the @entity16 capital of @entity76			1
in @entity16 , about 3 million lives were disrupted and more than 200,000 people died in the massive january earthquake			1
the flooding in @entity9 has been of epic proportions : 20 million people affected ; more than 1,400 dead ; 900,000 homes damaged ; 3.5 million children at risk of waterborne diseases			1
more people have been affected than in the 2004 @entity27 tsunami , the 2005 @entity27 earthquake , and the @entity16 earthquake combined			1
but the enormous scale of @entity9 's tragedy has been hard to grasp			1
the death toll has not been nearly as high as it was in those previous disasters			0
ironically , that may be a reason why aid has been slow to come in			0
" the public is not as shocked by a disaster if the death toll is lower , so we are trying to really push this emergency into the headlines so people understand the enormity of it , " said @entity98 , spokesman for @entity62 in @entity9			2
" the slow onset of the emergency meant that nobody knew the real scale at the beginning			0
it is a picture which is still evolving , " he said			0
the @entity2 asked for $ 460 million to cover six million @entity9 over the next three months , but has only raised one - third of that so far			2
in @entity16 , the @entity2 received $ 286 million in just three days			2
its request for $ 1.2 billion for three million @entity16 over a six - month period was fulfilled within a couple of weeks , @entity61 said			2
@entity118 , an expert on @entity9 for the @entity121 - based @entity120 think - tank , blamed the country 's reputation on the international stage for the low donor turnout			1
many people associate @entity9 with @entity128 militancy			2
" @entity9 is seen to have done the international community the disservice of aiding and abetting terrorism , and this perception has almost certainly influenced people 's willingness to dig deep into their pockets , " @entity129 said			1
there are also perceptions that @entity9 is mired in corruption and that money donated in the aftermath of the 2005 earthquake disappeared into a black hole			1
" unless @entity9 can show that it can be transparent , the international community will be wary of pumping in the kind of money that it needs at the moment , " @entity129 said			2
" in the meantime , many more thousands of people in @entity9 will die as a result of these floods			2
" donors like to give money to problems they feel they can help solve			0
they like to make a difference , said @entity155 , a professor of bioethics at @entity157 who has studied the subject			0
" there 's lots of evidence that shows people are less likely to help if they feel it 's a really big problem and they ca n't make a difference , " said @entity155 , author of " @entity165			0
" " when you hear the extent of the problem in @entity9 , i think there is a sense of futility			2
" @entity16 was smaller -- and closer to @entity172			2
@entity172 felt a moral responsibility to help and dug deep into their pockets			0
what was @entity16 's gain has been @entity9 's loss , said @entity178 , country director in @entity9 for the humanitarian agency @entity179			1
he called it @entity16 donor fatigue			1
in the middle of a recession , to boot			0
" there was a great outpouring of aid for @entity16 , " @entity178 said from @entity185			1
" so we know it 's there			0
people are suffering in @entity9			0
he urged people to think of it this way : take the effects of @entity197 in the four coastal states and multiply the misery			0
over and over again .			0

the response to the @entity16 earthquake was *quicker* and more generous
aid experts think it has to do with the evolving nature of the flooding
they also point to @entity9 's global image and donor fatigue
