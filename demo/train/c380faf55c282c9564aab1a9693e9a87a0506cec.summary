@entity0 , @entity1 -- environmentally friendly engineering is really right up @entity0 's alley -- in a city project called @entity6			1
@entity0 workers resurface alleys with permeable concrete that cleans rainwater before it runs into @entity11			1
the program aims to stop polluted rainwater in the city 's alleyways from ending up in adjacent @entity11			1
@entity0 's 13,000 alleys , which allow rear access to buildings , date back to the 1800s			1
the 1,900 miles of back alleys ease access for garbage collection , loading and parking			2
they also make up about 3,500 acres of impermeable surface , which has created a big problem			0
many of the alleys were built without connections to storm sewers			2
@entity33 puddles on the pavement and can run into buildings , sometimes flooding basements			0
" we wanted to come up with a different way of solving that problem other than reconstructing , putting in a sewer system and adding water to our already full sewer system , " said @entity37 , sustainability coordinator with the @entity39			2
so , the extreme alley makeover started with the pavement			2
the alleys are being resurfaced with concrete , asphalt or paving stones that are permeable -- that is , water runs through them like a sieve to the dirt beneath			1
microbes that thrive on stuff like fertilizer and oil are seeded into the pavement or migrate there naturally			1
they cleanse the water of pollutants from cars and lawns			0
the cleaner water makes its way into the groundwater , called an aquifer , and then flows into @entity11			0
that 's a big deal , @entity37 explained , because the city takes about a billion gallons of water out of @entity11 every year			1
but only about 1 percent of that water finds its way back to the lake , @entity37 said			0
" so by infiltrating that aquifer , we have a chance to [ give ] some of that water back			0
" additionally , green alleys feature pavement that 's high in albedo , or the ability to reflect light			1
the surface is lighter in color , reflecting more sunlight and absorbing less			0
" it 's like putting on a white t - shirt instead of a black one on a hot summer day , " @entity37 said			0
" it cools the city off and reduces our carbon footprint			0
" other features of the @entity98 program include the use of recycled materials in pavement and energy - efficient light fixtures that direct light downward to reduce light pollution			0
how green are those alleys ? @entity0 has greened 40 of them , with 48 more scheduled to get the treatment this year .			1

@entity0 covers alleys with *special* concrete that cleans polluted rain runoff
microbes in concrete eat pollutants such as fertilizer and oil
solution *avoids* having to rebuild city 's *massive* alley system
unique concrete also helps to keep city cooler on sunny days
