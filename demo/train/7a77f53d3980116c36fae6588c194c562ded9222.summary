-- aside from winning his home state of @entity3 and the bordering state of @entity5 , @entity1 has had a lackluster performance in the @entity8 race			1
it is about time for @entity10 to step out of the race and endorse @entity12			1
on @entity13 , @entity10 was fourth behind @entity14 , who almost everyone acknowledges has no chance to win the nomination , in no fewer than four states			2
he finished respectably in @entity19 ( 27 % ) and @entity20 ( 23 % ) , but still badly trailed @entity12 -- and even @entity22 -- in these conservative states where he would have had the best chance to garner support			1
since then , @entity12 swept the @entity26 caucuses			0
@entity10 is now making a strong effort in two other @entity29 states , @entity30 and @entity31 , and his staffers are intimating that if he does not do well there he will leave the race			2
it may be dawning on @entity10 that his chance of winning the @entity8 nomination is quickly receding and that he needs to think more about the conservative cause and what 's best for the @entity8			1
@entity10 and @entity12 have been competing for many of the same voters			1
had @entity10 not been in the race , @entity12 would probably have won more contests , including the biggest prize of @entity45 , as well as the @entity47 primary			1
it seems fairly certain that without @entity10 , @entity12 would now be the clear front - runner and some people would be calling for @entity22 to depart the race			1
@entity12 has positioned himself not only as the conservative alternative to @entity22 but the only candidate who can still snatch the nomination from him			1
although @entity22 has been touted for some time as the likely nominee and received many endorsements , he simply has not caught on with a sizable part of the party 's base			0
from the beginning of the campaign season , this has been the case			0
he won a narrow victory in @entity45 and in his home state of @entity47 because of moderate @entity8 voters in urban and suburban areas			0
some republicans believe that @entity22 is the strongest candidate to run against president @entity68 because he is most capable of broadening the party 's electoral base in the fall			2
however , @entity22 ca n't even broaden his own base within the party			1
when november comes , it 's not so clear that he can win the same urban and suburban voters who have reliably voted @entity76 in the past			0
and if at the same time he fails to gain enough support among the rest of the @entity8 base , then he certainly wo n't be able to generate the turnout he needs to win			1
moreover , his weakness with the @entity8 base has been reinforced by questions about his character , including his tendency to give off the impression of @entity88 aloofness , spend lavishly and use negative campaigning			0
the @entity8 establishment has encouraged the semi-marginalization of a substantial part of the party 's base this year by insistently claiming that only a " moderate " can win -- by which it seems to mean someone with an unclear message and unsettled convictions			0
this sounds like a recipe for defeat			0
the establishment has not only disconnected itself from the preferences of many of its rank - and - file -- without whom the party surely can not win -- but it has also shown itself to be oblivious to the historical record			0
while it has not always been the case , @entity8 moderates often lose			0
just think of @entity113 , @entity114 ( twice ) , @entity115 , @entity116 ( his re-election bid ) , @entity118 and @entity119			0
some of these men were much less philosophically murky than @entity22			0
@entity121 has confirmed what most observers intuitively know : @entity10 's voters would mostly go to @entity12			1
if @entity10 were to bow out , it would finally permit the kind of one - on - one race -- conservative versus moderate -- that would make clear where the rank - and - file wants the @entity8 to go and where its true electoral strength this year lies			1
let 's see whether @entity8 voters really want a moderate of @entity22 's stripe to lead them			2
@entity10 has performed his service by showing that clear , pointed and intellectually well - formulated challenges to the country 's current political drift will draw attention and support			2
unless he wins handsomely in the @entity29 , it 's time to let @entity12 -- whose intellectual and rhetorical gifts are not far behind @entity10 's -- lead the charge by himself			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity145 .			0

@entity147 : @entity1 has had a lackluster performance in the @entity8 race
@entity145 : @entity10 should step out of the race and endorse @entity12
he says @entity22 ca n't seem to broaden his support among @entity8
@entity145 : @entity12 is the only candidate who can take @entity8 nomination from @entity22
