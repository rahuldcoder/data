-- sometimes the price of success is losing the thing you most cherish			2
for @entity7 , every triumph in the sporting arena seemingly took her another step closer to an uncertain future			1
billed as " the girl with the @entity14 " after her heroics at the @entity12 , she feared that every time she competed would be the last waltz with her equine partner			1
the mere thought of losing her " best friend " reduced @entity7 to tears			1
@entity24 , the horse on which she won double gold , on which she was crowned double @entity26 champion and on which she aims to repeat the feat at august 's world championships , was attracting big offers			1
he was valued at $ 10 million but , after much speculation , @entity24 's " @entity32 " sign has finally come down -- meaning they now have the chance to continue a remarkable record - setting run together			1
" his future is secure -- he is never going to be sold , we have him forever , " the @entity38 rider says of the 12 - year - old horse , which is co-owned by her mentor and fellow @entity42 champion @entity41 and @entity43			2
" it 's an unbelievable relief			2
it was really , really hard knowing that every competition we did might be our last one			2
i never knew what was going on , i was too afraid to ask , " @entity7 tells @entity0			1
@entity51 , who won team dressage gold alongside @entity7 at @entity12 , hopes to set up a small syndicate to cover the costs of keeping @entity24 in competition			1
" there will be others i can sell on but this one is special , " the 46 - year - old told @entity14 and @entity57 earlier this year			2
" i did n't want @entity61 to feel like he might be sold -- it 's not great to ride under those conditions			2
besides , @entity24 has been with us since he was two so whoever we sell him to , are they going to look after him the way we do ? probably not			1
" @entity7 describes @entity24 -- more affectionately known as @entity69 at his yard -- as a @entity72 and , to all intents and purposes , she is a @entity75 as she wrestles the ultimate horsepower out of him			1
" he 's a real hot horse who likes to work , and he 's just the most willing and comfortable horse to ride , " she says of their " telepathic " partnership			2
" he trusts me implicitly , we both have that trust for each other			2
" as for me , i just do what i do			2
i just have a feeling inside me and i ca n't wholly explain that feeling			2
" @entity7 is the world no. 1 in dressage , which is split into two events ( the set routine and the freestyle ) and holds the world records in all three elements of her sport -- the freestyle , @entity99 and @entity100			1
her most recent record came at last month 's @entity102 in @entity103 with a score of 87.129 % comfortably beating her previous milestone of 85.942 set at the @entity106			2
she scored 92.179 % in the freestyle section			0
surely there is a ceiling to the records ? " well , you 'd think that but he just gets better every time , " @entity7 says			1
" i do n't know what the limit is although i do believe we can at least beat the freestyle record			0
there still feels like there 's more to come			0
" @entity7 is somewhat disbelieving at the success that she has achieved			1
it is true that she has n't gone down the typical route			0
she did not have the privileged upbringing of many of her rivals			0
born in @entity125 , north @entity126 , she only got her chance when her grandmother @entity128 died , leaving a five - figure inheritance to give @entity7 her the chance to buy her first horse of note			1
" it 's odd when i look back , i have to pinch myself sometimes , i honestly ca n't believe it , " she says			0
" i 've done more than i ever dreamed of			0
i 've just worked hard to get to the top			0
i 've had so many letters from people saying i 've inspired them to take up riding and that 's an amazing feeling			0
" getting to the top is one thing but staying there is quite another			0
that 's the difficult bit			0
" @entity7 will take a trip down memory lane on friday when competing at the @entity147 , one of the first events that she ever competed in as a child and a chance to display her and @entity24 's finery on home soil once more			1
her biggest home display will forever be the @entity12			1
the @entity38 team had entered it looking for a first @entity42 medal in the discipline in over a century , and she ended up picking up two golds ) in the space of just a week			0
but she admits : " life after @entity126 was tough			0
the whole experience was incredible			0
i 'd just aimed to be there so that was it , i 'd achieved my goal			0
to get those gold medals was just an unbelievable bonus			2
" but after that died down i almost felt a bit depressed -- understandable after such a high			0
it was difficult coming from doing so little media to suddenly being in the media spotlight			0
" people wanted me to do everything , and i found that really , really tough			0
it was a very difficult time			0
" part of that was down to the uncertainty of not knowing @entity24 's future but obviously that 's all changed			1
" throughout it all , the pair kept on winning and breaking records , but the complete happiness has fully returned in 2014			1
in addition , the @entity12 has brought her all manner of other unlikely facets to her life , ranging from a friendship with chart - topping singer @entity191 , who has come to see her train and compete , to passing on tips to former @entity195 footballer @entity194 on dressage for his daughter , who also rides			1
none of that has fazed @entity7 , who still bears the same trademark smile that delighted the crowds in @entity126 and has made her something of a smiling assassin in which she has decimated her rivals in competition			1
just the world title now is left on the to - do list			1
should she win that , she says : " i will have achieved everything in my career at the age of 28			0
it 'll be time to retire ! " but there are no retirement plans			0
she and @entity24 have plenty of competitions ahead of them			1
but she is relishing their new lease of life together			0
" i know i 'll never have another @entity24 and this is probably the peak of my career , " @entity7 says			1
" but who cares ? there are thousands of people that would like to have had this opportunity			0
i 've been lucky to have it , i will always have it and i will enjoy it			0
" it is a far cry from the rider that first turned up at the yard of @entity51 , himself an @entity42 champion who described her as @entity236 , because of her wooden riding skills akin to the character played by @entity239 in the 1990 movie @entity240			0
hers and @entity51 's relationship can still be a volatile one -- @entity7 admitting " we occasionally scream and shout at each other " -- but it is clearly stronger for the certainty over @entity24 's future			1
@entity7 knows she can save the pair 's last dance for some time .			1

@entity7 rode to double dressage gold at the @entity12 on @entity24
but the fear was the partnership would be separated with @entity24 up for sale
the partnership is now safe and the pair have gone on to break world records
@entity7 now has the world title in her sights , the one major success missing from her *cv*
