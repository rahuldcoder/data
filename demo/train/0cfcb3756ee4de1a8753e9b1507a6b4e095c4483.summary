-- @entity1 , who has wandered for months in his own private wilderness , is superbly poised for a major comeback			1
why ? because he has apologized , and it appears that he means it			2
compared with some other @entity10 public figures toppled by scandal , @entity1 is coming back the right way			1
unlike @entity14 after @entity13 , @entity1 has offered a clear , sincere sounding public apology			1
@entity14 squirmed and sweated and prevaricated for years after he hurled himself out of the @entity16 , but he could never find in himself enough manhood and public relations common sense to declare the simple words that might have saved his presidency in the first place : " i made some major mistakes , i acknowledge them unreservedly , and i ask the nation to consider forgiving me			1
" similarly , a @entity27 comeback was never going to happen			0
not only did he get tangled up with another woman while his wife was dying of cancer , he denied it , and then a " love child " appeared in the tabloids , as did a chatty mistress			0
then @entity27 offered tv quasi-apologies so weird and painful to watch that @entity10 decided just to switch him off permanently , shaking him off like a bad dream			1
in contrast , @entity39 @entity38 sen. @entity38 's career seemed doomed by a call - girl scandal in 2007 , until he held a press conference , took responsibility for his actions and asked for forgiveness			0
result : he was re-elected in 2010 , and is now considered a front - runner for the @entity49 @entity39 gubernatorial race in 2015			0
photos : public figures , private missteps other polarizing figures have come back from messy , highly chaotic personal lives , like @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			1
when i interviewed @entity1 for my book about the @entity61 a few years ago , i held a healthy dose of skepticism about his reputation as the man who turned the war around with the " surge			1
" i felt that momentum for a turnaround had already developed before @entity1 got back to @entity70 in early 2007 , thanks in part to the @entity70 awakening movement of 2006 and its @entity10 supporters , largely fairly junior @entity10 military officers in @entity76 , like capt. @entity77 and his colleagues			1
the funny thing was , @entity1 told me he thought pretty much the same thing himself			1
either he is a self - aware man with a dose of humility or a shrewd manipulator of his audience			0
either trait will serve him well			0
i doubt we 'll see @entity1 in a straight government job anytime soon			2
the circumstances of his @entity91 departure were just too messy			2
but other than public service , the world is his oyster , thanks to the towering reputation he had before the scandal			1
@entity1 might even run for office someday			2
given his intelligence and communication skills , and the often wretched choices voters are presented with , he might even have a shot			0
after that , would a president @entity1 be in the cards ? a real long shot			2
but do n't laugh too hard			0
for now , though , he is well - positioned to become a highly sought - after tv pundit , corporate board member , @entity112 partner , you name it			0
he might write a big book about his career and military insights			0
he 'll be courted by @entity117 and the press			0
in the right @entity117 hands , his book might even make a hell of a good movie			0
he will give big speeches on the national security issues of the day , and might even advise a president or two again someday			0
@entity10 seem to have limited patience for public figures who lie , cheat , steal or make spectacles that make everyone look silly			1
but when people foul up in a spectacular fashion , especially when it involves a personal matter , @entity10 will give them a break and a second chance -- as long as they stand up like a man or a woman , admit they screwed up , say they 're sorry and look like they damn well mean it			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity142 .			2

@entity1 has apologized for his *extramarital* affair since *resigning* from the @entity91
@entity142 : @entity1 is superbly poised for a major comeback
he says @entity10 will give public figures a second chance when the apology is sincere
@entity142 : other than public service ( for now ) , @entity1 can do anything
