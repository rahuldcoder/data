-- patience and persistence paid off for jockey @entity3 on saturday as he helped @entity4 to become only the third woman trainer to win @entity7 's most famous -- and most controversial -- steeplechase , the @entity8			1
the @entity12 jockey , having his first ride in the race , briefly quit horse racing during a frustrating 2011 season			2
but in a fairytale turnaround , the 23 - year - old , who only returned to the saddle this winter , rode 66 - 1 outsider @entity18 to victory in the four - and - a - half - mile marathon			1
after an almost flawless run , the 11 - year - old stormed home ahead of @entity25 and @entity26 in front of a 70,000 crowd in @entity29 , watched by an estimated 600 million television audience			0
" i could n't have asked for a better ride and the old horse was loving it as well , " said @entity3 , after winning by nine lengths on a horse who had failed to finish three of his last seven starts and was well off the pace in the other four			2
mania started working with 65 - year - old @entity4 and her husband @entity40 after a six - month hiatus when his former boss lost his training license			0
" i could n't have come back without them , " he said			0
" the opportunities for jockeys up north are very limited and i am lucky to have such a good yard behind me			0
" there was further welcome news for racing fans as it was confirmed that all 40 of the horses and riders to start the race returned home unscathed -- although only 17 of those completed the course			1
the annual @entity58 event had been under intense scrutiny from animals rights groups after recent editions of the race had been marred by a high number of equine fatalities -- 11 since 2002			2
that prompted race organizers to introduce a number of new safety measures this year , spending more than Â £ 1 million ( $ 1.5 million ) on alterations , including modifying the structure of the jumps themselves to make them safer and more forgiving and watering the ground the ensure going no faster than good - to - soft			1
however , there were two deaths in races in the first two days of this week 's meeting , prompting criticism from animal welfare groups			2
" we are delighted there have been no fatalities in today 's big race , " dr. @entity80 from the @entity81 told @entity0 on saturday			0
" the ( earlier ) deaths of the horses @entity88 and @entity89 reflects current risk of fatalities in steeplechasing which needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency			0
" horse deaths or fatalities at the @entity8 are not freak accidents , but statistical probabilities			1
the risks prove to be high each year			0
we are not calling for a ban of the @entity8 or a ban of horse racing , but merely to make the race safer for the horse and indeed the jockey			1
" in a nonetheless eventful race , on which in excess of Â £ 100 million ( $ 150 million ) was wagered by punters , @entity110 , the 11 - 2 favorite and last year 's third - placer , ran well for @entity113 until running out of steam with a handful of fences to jump , eventually fading to 13th			1
she was seeking to become the first woman rider to win the race , but caused controversy in the buildup when she claimed it would have been " a lot worse if two jockeys had lost their lives " in reference to the two fatalities at last year 's @entity8			1
her brother @entity132 , riding the second favorite on his own , was a casualty at @entity134 , the 25th fence of 30			0
but fortune did smile on swashbuckling amateur jockey @entity137 , who finished a creditable fourth on @entity139 , the runner - up in 2011 .			0

@entity18 *defies* the odds to win saturday 's @entity8 at @entity58
@entity3 rides the 66 - 1 outsider to victory in jockey 's debut *appearance*
only 17 of 40 entrants complete race , but no *repeat* of last year 's two horse deaths
however , two horses died following races earlier in the three - day meeting
