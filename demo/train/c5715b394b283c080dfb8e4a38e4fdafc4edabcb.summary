using the @entity21 app , anyone with a @entity27 account can book and pay for a ride with one of the @entity21 drivers , like a more casual and kooky @entity32			1
the oversized , fluffy mustaches affixed to car grills started as a smart marketing gambit			0
but the silly accessory and @entity11 's social - focused approach ended up infusing the makeshift fleet with peppy , perky and chatty personality and attracting outgoing drivers			1
during orientation , drivers are encouraged to express themselves with their vehicles , to join @entity16 and to offer something extra to passengers , like candy			1
" we really want everyone to have this opportunity to explore their creativity with @entity21 , " said @entity11 co-founder @entity47			1
sometimes it 's the car that 's decorated			0
@entity55 's chalkboard - paint covered car , which was originally made for the @entity57 festival , is covered in doodles from riders and passersby			2
some cars have games and other diversions ; the @entity65 car keeps a @entity66 of rider 's poems			2
all @entity21 cars offer an array of smartphone chargers , but many drivers give out more than electricity			1
there are savory and sweet treats , tchotchkes and fruit			0
@entity78 , a @entity5 driver , makes custom goodie bags filled with candy and cards bearing handwritten inspirational quotes that she says helped her get through a recent motorcycle accident ( she was a passenger )			0
not to be outdone by their cars , the @entity11 drivers can be equally over the top			1
in @entity23 , there is a driver who dresses like @entity90			0
" @entity21 is all about being the friend with the car , treating that person as if they were a friend of yours , " said @entity21 co-founder @entity47			1
friends do n't let friends sit quietly in the back seat playing @entity100 while they give you a ride home from happy hour			2
lyft rides are supposed to be social activities			1
drivers are trained to greet riders with a fist bump as a way of breaking the ice			2
( @entity112 is very un-lyft like			0
) passengers are encouraged to sit in the front seat so they can make small talk			2
the job appeals to artists , actors , djs , and singers who want to fund their fledgling careers with flexible part - time work using their cars			1
classical singer @entity124 fits in a full 40 hours a week around auditions			0
she stocks her car with clementines and @entity128 and says the conversations and random connections she makes driving for @entity21 are the best part of the job			1
snacks are big with @entity21 drivers , but few have taken it as far as entrepreneur and @entity21 driver @entity138 -- aka @entity21			1
in the morning , @entity138 bakes two batches of cookies and packs them in @entity141			2
riders taste each flavor and vote for their favorites			0
the winning cookie is announced on @entity16 and the cookie goes on to compete against a new recipe the next day			0
@entity149 , 35 , is still in the @entity151 full - time , but picks up @entity11 shifts in the evening			2
his spotless @entity153 is posh enough to pass for an @entity32 , with new upholstery , a custom sound system and tv screens that allow passengers to sit back and enjoy episodes of " @entity159			2
" there are others like @entity162 , a " @entity164 " - themed car , and @entity165			2
the vehicles range from scrubby @entity167 to higher - end luxury vehicles			0
there are even a @entity170 and a @entity171			0
the @ @entity16 account keeps tabs on some of the more notable rider experiences and tweeting drivers			1
the @entity21 app does n't let people choose which car they 'll ride in , but the extra personality can still have a financial up - side			1
using the @entity21 app , passengers choose how much to pay to the driver after their ride and can increase or decrease the suggested amount based on how they felt about the experience			1
( @entity11 drivers do n't see how much they were paid until the end of their shifts			0
) in many ways , @entity21 is the opposite of the original @entity194 community ride - sharing experience , a casual carpool			1
the loose network of strangers who grab rush - hour rides at preset stops has its own unwritten rules : the radio should be set to @entity202 and played at a soothingly low volume , and silence is golden			1
@entity32 , which recently ran @entity207 ads that said " shave the stache , " sticks to the usual car service etiquette			0
cars are clean and un-adorned , riders are in the back and conversation is optional			0
@entity214 is a service similar to @entity21 and also asks passengers to sit up front , but it has n't seen the same boom in creativity from drivers			1
a highly social ride is n't for everyone			1
many people who want peace and quiet or a luxury , shiny black car will stick with car companies or @entity32			0
shy people are n't the only ones who do n't enjoy @entity11			0
like @entity32 , @entity21 and @entity214 have become popular alternatives to hailing a taxi or calling a cab company directly			2

the smartphone - app based services also are running into regulatory issues			0
the @entity23 @entity240 recently issued a cease and desist order to the three companies , citing a lack of proper permits and licenses			0
for now , the services are fighting to keep running and also working on expansion plans to other cities			0
starting in @entity250 meant @entity11 had a big pool of disco - loving , baked - goods making eccentrics , actors and @entity57 attendees willing to be drivers			1
@entity256 will tell if newer cities also embrace the weird .			0

ride - sharing service @entity21 has attracted some outgoing drivers and kooky cars
some @entity21 cars offer cookies , movies , *costumes* or karaoke to passengers
the service focuses on making rides social experiences , which may not appeal to everyone
