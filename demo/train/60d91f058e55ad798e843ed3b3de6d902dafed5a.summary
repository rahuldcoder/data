in minutes , the world 's most - watched new father sent a message about millions of dads			2
stepping outside the hospital with his wife , @entity7 , and their newborn son , prince @entity4 was a picture of confidence			2
each parent held the baby , now known to the world as @entity15 -- and they looked equally comfortable doing so			2
he got his newborn all set in the car seat , and drove off			2
analysts noted that he was projecting an image of equality			0
to many dads , he was representing the reality that we know : the image of bumbling , clueless dads is an outdated stereotype			0
of course , that does n't mean we think we 're picture - perfect -- a point that came up when @entity30 recently asked dads what it means to be a father in today 's world			2
some decided to use the @entity37 assignment as a chance to open up about their insecurities			0
" although i know that the intent of this report is to stand up proudly and say , ' ... i 'm a dad and i 'm damn good at it , ' the truth is i do n't feel that way half the time , " stay - at - home dad @entity43 wrote from @entity44 , @entity45			1
" most days , if i 'm being honest , i feel like i 'm faking my way through this			0
" that 's how just about all parents feel sometimes : overwhelmed			0
yes , that includes , i 'm sure , the @entity55 and @entity56 , even in the life they lead			0
" i am far from perfect in my role as a father , " writes @entity58 , who has been a stay - at - home dad in @entity59 for five years and founded the @entity60			1
" i lose my temper , get impatient , too structured , do n't do the laundry , and fail miserably , often			0
it 's the most challenging job i have ever encountered as well as the most rewarding			0
" we were looking for dads ' thoughts on the 30 - year anniversary of " mr. @entity70 " -- a movie that made sense at the time , when a dad taking on traditionally female roles at home was so rare			1
and when it was more believable that he would have so much trouble figuring out how to do basics around the house			0
little did those behind the film know that it would ultimately stand as something of a historical demarcation			0
the funniest thing about the idea of " mr. @entity70 " now is that it was such a funny idea in the first place			1
modern fathers face new expectations statistics tell a piece of the story			1
there are about 189,000 stay - at - home dads now , caring for 369,000 children , according to the @entity98			1
these are defined as married fathers with kids younger than 15 who have stayed out of the labor force for at least a year primarily to care for the family			1
a more striking figure : 18 % of preschoolers are regularly cared for by their fathers during the mother 's working hours			2
as these numbers keep growing , the perception that child - rearing and homemaking are " women 's work " that dads sometimes do becomes increasingly anachronistic			1
" 1983 was mr. @entity70 's year			1
just call me dad , " @entity117 , stay - at - home father in @entity118 , @entity119 , writes on his blog , " @entity121			1
" the @entity123 , which provides support and advocacy to its members , has even launched a campaign to banish the term , citing a @entity130 declaration : " mr. @entity70 is dead			1
" many people who use the term certainly mean no harm			0
but for some dads , getting past the term is an important way to end the mindset that suggests their work at home is any less " manly " than bringing home a paycheck			2
" i was called ' mr. mom ' by a random guy at my wife 's hair salon , " says @entity143 , full - time dad of a 14 - month - old boy in @entity145			1
" he said , ' you ca n't play mr. @entity70 too long			1
' i was pretty stunned			0
" and a female relative asked @entity143 , " when are you going to get a job ? you ca n't stay home forever			1
" " she said ' mr. @entity70 ' without saying ' mr. @entity70 , ' " @entity143 says			1
" i just let the comments go			0
i know i 'm not going to change any person 's worldview with a 30 - minute debate			1
" those of us who work full - time but are more committed to our kids than to our jobs are just as quick to reject the stereotypes of bumbling , clueless fathers in commercials , tv shows , or online			2
that 's partly because negative portrayals of dads can cause problems -- like affecting how the judicial system views fathers ' parental capabilities			2
we also speak out to share ideas and advice -- because modern dads understand each other			2
we know what it is to be fathers in changing times , facing challenges and pressures , and committed to keeping parenthood our top priority			2
there 's a kind of communal celebration going on			0
on blogs and at conferences , dads are sharing with each other how awesome it is to live in a time that 's so far beyond " mr. @entity70			1
" we know we 're part of something special : a generation that 's helping turn @entity203 fatherhood into something more emotional and deeper -- something i referred to in a @entity206 as a part of the ultimate dream			0
but saying a loud , vociferous " no " to " mr. @entity70 " does n't mean claiming the mantle of @entity210			1
it just means we 're trying to do our best			0
just like good moms across the country			0
@entity203 dads have come a long way in 30 years			1
and we 're not alone , as prince @entity4 showed			0
just imagine what 's ahead			0
@entity117 's son was asked in kindergarten what he wants to be when he grows up			0
his answer : " a stay - at - home dad			1
" got a parenting story to share ? post your personal essays here .			0

" mr. @entity70 " was made 30 years *ago* , and created the *archetypical* stay - at - home dad
modern fathers are rejecting the " mr. @entity70 " label as outmoded
surveys show fathers doing more and more primary child care tasks at home
stay - at - home fathers say they are simply doing their duty , not shooting for perfection
