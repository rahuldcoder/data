@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity0 has grown rapidly from a small trading hub into a thriving city , and one of the key players in this transformation is a company called @entity9 -- which in @entity10 means " to develop			1
" executive chairman , @entity11 has been there from the start and played a huge part in the expansion and diversification of the tiny emirate			1
inflation is not the biggest threat to growth in @entity0 , says @entity11 @entity22 talks to @entity24 's @entity23 about the changes he has witnessed , and what he sees for the @entity28 's future			1
@entity23 kicks off by asking @entity22 if he thinks @entity0 's rapid growth has created an economic bubble and whether inflation is the biggest threat to growth			1
( @entity34 ) : i would n't say it 's the biggest threat			1
i would say there are many challenges that we face and have faced in the past , and will continue to face			2
and one of which is inflation , and we have programs to sustain it , and insure that it contributes to development			1
the other is the attraction of talent			2
ensuring that we understand how the world works , and how we can integrate @entity0 in this system is another challenge			1
( @entity53 ) : are you interested in moderating growth here because of the potential bubble ? ( @entity34 ) : i 've personally heard of these reports from many , many organizations over the last five to seven years			1
in order to understand them , i think one needs to break down the statement and this asset real estate bubble that is referred to			1
we need to look at the industry			2
and the industry for us is broken down into three to four different folds , ranging from residential , all the way to hotels , and hospitality assets			2
now , if these were standing on their own , i think there would be merit to the hypothesis			2
but they are not , because in @entity0 they are all clustered around strategies			1
so , personally speaking , i do n't believe there is a fear of that bubble , because it 's managed around certain variables , certain clusters , and we keep our eyes on it			1
( @entity53 ) : what do you accept as a reasonable inflation rate with growth running at 10 or 11 percent for the last six years ? what is acceptable from the @entity9 perspective ? ( @entity34 ) : anything between four and five percent is acceptable			1
( @entity53 ) : and you 're running at nine right now			2
so do you need to bring it down ? ( @entity34 ) : well , it depends which figures you look at , and which industries you examine			2
and our industries , as i said , are predominately driven by the clusters that we are mandated to develop and grow , and those range from hospitality , all the way to entertainment and leisure			2
i think , as far as inflation is concerned , we need to go skin deep , because there is a whole basket of products that contribute to that item			1
it is not just real estate - the price of milk is one item in a basket that contributes to the information number			0
( @entity53 ) : there are strains throughout the region right now related to food security			0
does that concern you ? ( @entity34 ) : these are challenges and fears we have faced , and have overcome over the last 50 years			0
we 've been doing this for the last 20 to 22 years			0
i 'm not saying we have answers for everything			0
that would not be prudent			0
i 'm saying we are a proactive government			0
we are a government that recognizes its faults as in when they happen			0
but we are not egotistic and unable to say ' okay , let 's find a solution			1
' ( @entity53 ) : you are one of the key players here , and you have a number for projects that you 've noted under management right now			1
i understand you threw away a lot of the feasibility studies that were handed to you			0
you did n't think they were grand enough			0
is that true ? that you just said look - this is just way to conservative for my tastes right now ? ( @entity34 ) : that was n't me			0
that was my boss i 'm afraid			0
( @entity53 ) : you 're referring to @entity154 ? ( @entity34 ) : yes			0
at least with two of the clusters that we drive , which are healthcare and entertainment , specifically in @entity162			0
rest assured all have feasibility studies			0
my job as a manager is to ensure that all of those yield an acceptable return to the stakeholder			0
