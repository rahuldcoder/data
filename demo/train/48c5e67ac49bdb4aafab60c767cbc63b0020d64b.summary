could this be the deadliest smartphone app ever ? a @entity3 security consultant , who 's also a commercial pilot , has demonstrated tools he says could be used to hijack an airplane remotely , using just an @entity7 phone			1
speaking at the @entity8 in the @entity10 security summit in @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 said wednesday that he spent three years developing @entity14 , a framework of malicious code that could be used to attack and exploit airline security software , and an @entity7 app to run it that he calls @entity19			1
using a flight simulator , @entity13 showed off the ability to change the speed , altitude and direction of a virtual airplane by sending radio signals to its flight - management system			2
current security systems do n't have strong enough authentication methods to make sure the commands are coming from a legitimate source , he said			2
" you can use this system to modify approximately everything related to the navigation of the plane , " @entity13 told @entity33 after his presentation			2
" that includes a lot of nasty things			0
" he told the crowd that the tools also could be used to do things like change what 's on a pilot 's display screen or turn off the lights in the cockpit			2
with the @entity7 app he created , he said , he could remotely control a plane by simply tapping preloaded commands like " @entity55 " and the ominous " @entity56			0
" the @entity57 said it is aware of @entity13 's claims , but said the hacking technique does not pose a threat on real flights because it does not work on certified flight hardware			1
" the described technique can not engage or control the aircraft 's autopilot system using the ( @entity67 ) or prevent a pilot from overriding the autopilot , " the @entity57 said			0
" therefore , a hacker can not obtain ' full control of an aircraft ' as the technology consultant has claimed			0
" @entity13 says he developed @entity14 in a way that makes it work only in virtual environments , not on actual aircraft			1
but the risk is there , some experts say			0
" his testing laboratory consists of a series of software and hardware products , but the connection and communication methods , as well as ways of exploitation , are absolutely the same as they would be in an actual real - world scenario , " analysts at @entity81 wrote in a blog post			0
@entity13 told the crowd that he used flight - management hardware that he bought on @entity94 and publicly available flight - simulator software that contains at least some of the same computer coding as real flight software			1
analyst @entity98 of @entity99 said it 's unclear how devastating @entity102 's find would be if unleashed on an airplane in flight			0
" no one else has had an opportunity to test this researcher 's claims as he has , thankfully , kept secret details of the vulnerabilities he was able to exploit , " @entity98 said			0
" we are also told that he has informed the relevant bodies , so steps can be taken to patch any security holes before someone with more malicious intent has an opportunity to exploit them			0
" @entity13 said at the summit that he 's reached out to the companies that make the systems he exploited and that they were receptive to addressing his concerns			2
he also said he 's contacted aviation safety officials in the @entity125 and @entity126			1
" from the sound of things , this researcher has got himself a lot of media attention , but still believes in responsible disclosure , rather than potentially putting aircraft and passengers at risk , " @entity98 said			0
@entity102 is n't the first so - called " white hat " hacker to expose what appear to be holes in air - traffic security			1
last year , at the @entity143 security conference in @entity144 , computer scientist @entity141 discussed weaknesses he said he found in a new @entity125 air - traffic security system set to roll out next year			1
the flaws he found were n't instantly catastrophic , he said , but could be used to track private airplanes , intercept messages and jam communications between planes and air - traffic control .			1

a @entity3 security researcher says he has developed an app that could hack planes
@entity13 is a security consultant and a *licensed* commercial pilot
his software , @entity14 , is designed to work only on simulations
he 's contacted makers of air - traffic systems and authorities in @entity125 and @entity126
