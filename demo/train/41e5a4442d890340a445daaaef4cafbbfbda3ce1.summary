-- @entity1 had toiled for months as a @entity3 soldier in @entity4			1
but it was his 7,000 - mile trip home -- racing against the clock to his wife 's bedside , for the birth of their baby -- that he described monday as " pretty intense			1
" the @entity16 specialist told @entity18 's @entity17 that the tight timetable and sheer distance led him to believe that his chances were slim of joining wife @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24 , before their child was born			1
" i did n't really have much hope about making it back , " @entity22 said			2
first , there was the matter of leaving @entity4			2
@entity22 said monday that his unit commanders " sent me back as soon as they could			2
" on the baby 's due date , he was finally back in the @entity3 -- but not with his wife			1
instead , he was in @entity36 in @entity37 , where he had to take a few mandatory classes			0
but the baby was still holding out			0
on @entity40 morning , @entity22 said he boarded a flight to @entity42 , @entity24 , then quickly hopped on the road -- still about one hour , 15 minutes from the base in the western part of the state			1
" i got into a car and pretty much flew down there , " @entity22 said from @entity23			2
" i made it just in the nick of time			0
" specifically , the soldier said he burst into the hospital room about 30 minutes before his son , @entity53 , made his own grand appearance			1
@entity22 said that , throughout the process , he 'd been in regular contact with @entity22			0
but talking online and by phone did n't compare to being with his growing family in person , especially with baby @entity53 in his arms			0
" he 's doing fantastic , " the soldier said of his son			0
" i could n't ask for a better gift than to have him healthy and here with me			0
