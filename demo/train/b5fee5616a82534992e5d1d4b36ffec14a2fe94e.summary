-- @entity1 on friday became the latest state to sue @entity3 , @entity4 and others tied to the 2010 @entity6 , alleging the parties " engaged in willful and wanton misconduct " and seeking penalties and damages " to the fullest extent allowed by law			1
" the lawsuit was filed in @entity14 in @entity15 , more than three years after one of the worst oil spills in @entity19 history			2
listed defendants include @entity21 , @entity4 and @entity22 , in addition to @entity3			1
@entity1 is not the first state to file such a lawsuit			1
@entity27 , for instance , did so last month , joining several other @entity28			0
the @entity1 attorney general 's office , in a news release friday , said the state expects " its case to be consolidated " with others -- all of them intent on recouping " damages associated with harm caused to the @entity38			1
" the @entity1 lawsuit asks for money from @entity3 and other parties for a host of reasons			1
they include sales and hotel occupancy taxes that the state did n't receive , it contends , because visitors and others did n't go to its @entity28 communities due to the spill , as well as " lost " revenue for state park entrance and concession fees			0
the lawsuit also asks for civil penalties for every barrel as well as every day that oil was discharged into the @entity38			1
the disaster began with a rig explosion aboard the @entity62 in the @entity38 , killing 11 workers			2
it took nearly three months to stop the gushing oil , which was done by placing a cap on the well nearly a mile beneath the water 's surface			2
by then , though , the discharge had already caused major environmental damage , not to mention significantly affecting @entity28 economies			0
the spill damaged coral reef formations , according to researchers			0
scientists have previously confirmed that a plume of hydrocarbons from the well settled in the deep @entity38			0
the @entity78 said about 59,200 barrels of oil a day flowed from the well			0
in november , attorney general @entity81 announced that @entity3 will plead guilty to manslaughter charges stemming from the explosion and the spill			1
it agreed to pay $ 4.5 billion in government penalties			0
a month later , a federal judge signed off on @entity3 's settlement with businesses and people hard hit by the spill			1
thousands of businesses and individuals made claims in @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , some coastal counties in eastern @entity1 and western @entity27 and adjacent @entity38 waters and bays			2
@entity3 estimated a settlement of about $ 7.8 billion paid from a $ 20 billion trust			0
with the exception of seafood claims , there is no cap on the amount @entity3 will pay to those who agree to the settlement			2
but that did n't fully settle the incident , as a number of states continue to press for damages			0
@entity1 , for one , does n't specify in its lawsuit how much money it is seeking			1
@entity117 , a spokesman for that state 's attorney general , said there is no estimate as to how much the state is seeking -- or might receive -- adding " any damage amounts in this case would be determined by a jury verdict or final settlement			0
" @entity27 sues @entity3 , @entity4 on spill 's third anniversary @entity0 's @entity129 contributed to this report .			1
