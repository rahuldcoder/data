@entity0 , a junior at @entity1 , is a columnist for @entity2 , a national student newspaper dedicated to coverage of the 2008 presidential race			1
@entity5 is a feature that provides student perspectives on news and trends from colleges across the @entity11			2
the views expressed in this article are not necessarily those of @entity14 , its affiliates or the schools where the campus correspondents are based			1
@entity0 : " i could n't help but be suspicious of everything and everyone			1
" @entity20 , @entity21 ( @entity14 ) -- college students are faced with many challenges each day			1
it 's tough to balance a job with hours of homework , and to pay attention in class while planning an escape route from a lecture hall seat			2
as i sat in class following the @entity34 shootings a year ago , i could n't help but be suspicious of everything and everyone			1
it 's not that i thought someone was going to walk into my particular classroom and start unloading -- i realize the chances of this happening are about as small as my chances of retiring by age 30 -- but the events pushed my mind into " what if " mode			1
going to school on a large campus can be scary at times -- especially for incoming freshmen who are used to high school classes with less than 30 students -- but never more so than the days following tragedy			1
the fear does n't necessarily stem from the notion that danger is imminent , but rather from the idea that you do n't know who people really are and what they are capable of , or how you would react to straits so dire			1
the collective picture of the perpetrators is not an encouraging one , and rightfully so			2
the images of students banding together at memorials and vigils get locked in your mind			1
and after all the fear and frustration and anger and hopelessness dissipate , all we 've got is the future , where we ask , " how do we prevent this ? " of course , to know the accurate prevention measures , we have to know the cause			2
though everything from violence in media to @entity85 culture have been examined , there is only one major link behind the motives of the shooters of past school shootings : mental instability			2
looking back , everything from the @entity34 and @entity92 incidents of the past year to the @entity94 clock tower and @entity96 massacres of 1966 and 1976 , respectively , have had killers who had previously been receiving psychological treatment			0
in the 1989 @entity99 in @entity100 , @entity101 , the psychological and psychiatric profile of the killer contained in the coroner 's report said , " the multiple homicide / suicide strategy is ... known to be a characteristic of individuals who have a serious personality disorder			0
" perpetrators of violent massacres do not think rationally , and if they are social isolationists who do n't have a close support group , prevention via medication and therapy can only be successful in stopping the relatively tame			1
trying to ensure nonviolence on this micro level is like trying to eliminate interethnic combat on the macro level			0
so we focus on our safety			0
what do we do to protect ourselves ? i know ... let 's talk about gun control ! with the increase in both violence and the attention paid to it with respect to college campuses , gun rights have been a topic that 's been under much discussion			0
fantasies of vigilante justice fuel some students ' desires to carry a concealed weapon to class			1
currently , only @entity143 allows students to carry guns on campus			1
even @entity147 has explicit bans			0
three years ago , a @entity34 student was reprimanded for carrying , and ensuing legislation to allow concealed weapons on colleges faltered before reaching the floor of the state @entity154			0
with this knowledge , one wonders if , had decisions been made differently , there is a small possibility there would have been less than 32 balloons released at @entity34 's first home football game			0
on the contrary , guns should n't need to be allowed on campus			1
after all , dorm rooms -- where many a party takes place -- are hardly the ideal setting for a gun to be readily available , and the frequency of school shootings is not high enough to convince many @entity11 that the rewards outweigh the risks			0
unfortunately , it is high enough that all campus and city police departments need to have measures in place for such emergencies			1
in september 2006 , @entity100 's @entity180 learned response lessons from the aforementioned @entity183 episode			0
instead of police waiting until the swat team arrived , they took immediate action , and only one student was murdered			0
@entity21 schools have begun purchasing long - range rifles for use in similar situations , and many other schools are re-evaluating their emergency - response procedures , but even those do n't guarantee safety			2
it takes a collaborative effort to keep us safe , but the burden should not be placed entirely on the students or the institution			2
legislation needs to continue to be passed to help keep weapons from those who are dangerous to us , while preserving our individual rights , and we as concerned @entity11 need to encourage discussion of these matters within our congresses			0
colleges and universities are a place of wisdom and expansion			0
fear and bullets surely seem the antithesis			0
