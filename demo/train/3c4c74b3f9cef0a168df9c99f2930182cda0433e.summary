-- a @entity2 entrepreneur claims to have found a way to buy 1 million air miles for as little as $ 6,500			1
those air miles could translate into two first or business class trips on @entity7 from the @entity8 to the @entity9 , or up to five return first class trips to @entity11 on @entity12			1
best part : he says anyone could do the same			0
the scheme , hatched by @entity17 , principal owner of @entity18 which runs travel deals website mightytravels.com , involves applying for credit cards that offer generous sign - up and spending bonuses and then buying gift cards with the credit cards , which you immediately liquidate back into cash			1
as long as you pay off your credit cards in full each month , that amounts to thousands of air miles for the price of the gift and credit card fees , which in his scheme amount to around $ 6,500 over the course of a year			1
cards for miles " it requires just two credit cards that most people will be easily eligible for and a couple of minutes of your time every day for a 12 - month period , " he told @entity0			1
by using the @entity46 and the @entity47 , which offer generous sign - up bonuses and redemption benefits , and using them to buy $ 1,500 - worth of gift cards each day , @entity17 says he is already 150,000 miles toward his goal of 1 million air miles			1
he has only researched the scheme in the @entity8 so far , and you may need to register for an online payment system such as @entity56			2
but if you 've got the time , this could be a cheap ticket to a first class flight across the world , he says			2
" if you manage to buy an average of $ 1,500 of gift cards every day and use @entity46 and @entity66 to liquidate your gift cards , three gift cards per day [ for a year ] equals $ 6,186.75 in fees , plus a $ 250 partial credit card fee			1
" @entity70 earned : 765,000 @entity71 points and 182,500 aadvantage miles			0
since both credit cards have a sign - up bonus , you 'll actually earn a total of 282,500 aadvantage miles and 790,000 @entity47 points			1
" so what 's the catch ? " it 's 100 % legal			0
however stores could stop selling gift cards with a credit card			2
that has happened , but it 's very easy to find supermarkets / gas stations who are allowing that volume of sales per day ; $ 1,500 is small -- i have done up to $ 5,000 per store several days in a row			0
" @entity17 even has preferred routes to get the most of his air miles once they 're earned			2
" [ my ] recommendation would be to use the aadvantage miles for a trip for two to the @entity9 or @entity98 with @entity7 or @entity99			0
for both airlines the surcharges / fees are minimal			0
" as for @entity71 , the most luxurious option is @entity12 ' [ frequent flyer program ] @entity105 to @entity106			0
this can be had for around 150,000 one - way when redeemed online			2
" @entity109 transfer instantly to @entity105			0
taxes and fees come to about $ 250 per round - trip ticket			0

@entity2 entrepreneur says he is 150,000 miles into a 1 million air mile target
scheme involves buying gift cards with air mile - linked credit cards , and immediately liquidating the cash
only researched for @entity8 so far , but is good for first class flights on various airlines
