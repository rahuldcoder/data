-- " it was like taking a big leap of faith			0
" that 's how @entity4 describes her decision back in 2012 to leave her well - paid job at a major international bank in @entity9 's capital @entity10 to follow her dream and embark on her own entrepreneurial journey			1
having worked for six years as the bank 's only female it specialist , @entity4 quit everything to create @entity16 , a software development company			1
" my friends thought i was crazy , " recalls @entity4			1
" but i was like , ' this is it ! ' " one of @entity9 's first female tech entrepreneurs , @entity4 had to overcome many challenges in starting her business -- beginning with breaking the gender barrier in her country			1
" as an @entity31 woman , the role is you go to school , you get a job , you marry , " says @entity4 , whose startup is now building corporate websites and e-commerce portals for more than 30 businesses in @entity10			1
" @entity35 is not something that you are taught so i never saw myself as an entrepreneur			2
" last summer , out of a passion to pass on her expertise , @entity4 co-founded " @entity40 , " a mentorship and educational initiative aiming to encourage young women to pursue a career in technology			1
along with other female computer scientists , she makes time to visit places like @entity48 , a slum right in the heart of @entity10 , to teach girls how to code and develop mobile and web applications			1
@entity0 's @entity53 caught up with @entity4 to talk about her initiative and discuss the reasons why there should be more women in technology			1
here 's what she said			0
improving technical innovation : " currently we are missing out on valuable perspectives that 50 % of the population can bring to designing the technology of the future			2
research shows that diversity improves problem solving , productivity , innovation and ultimately the bottom line -- we need the female perspective in technology			0
" reducing social inequalities : " computing jobs are among the fastest growing and the highest paying , yet few women are benefiting from these occupations			0
this trend increases social inequalities and barriers to girls ' future life opportunities			0
girls need to have technology skills in order to thrive in the 21st century as more than 95 % of all jobs have a digital component			2
" teaching girls leadership skills and critical thinking : " by learning to create technology girls learn to speak up since they have to explain their work ; they must stand tall in order to be taken seriously in this male - dominated field			1
the process of writing software is essentially solving a problem using critical thinking and a series of steps			0
the girls also get to express their creativity through their software designs			0
" stopping the workforce exit : " more than half ( 56 % ) of women in technology leave their employers at the mid-level point in their careers ( 10 - 20 years )			2
some describe themselves as lone wolves			0
personally i found technology to be very lonely since i was always the only female in the it department			0
" the numbers say it all : " in the @entity115 , women hold less than 25 % of science , technology , engineering and math ( @entity119 ) jobs			2
in the @entity123 , women now make up 46 % of the country 's workforce , but hold only 15.5 % of the @entity119 jobs -- this excludes medicine , which has a high representation of women			0
each year the number of women studying and pursuing careers in technology goes down by 0.5 % thus by 2043 at the current trend less than 1 % of the global tech workforce will be female			1
