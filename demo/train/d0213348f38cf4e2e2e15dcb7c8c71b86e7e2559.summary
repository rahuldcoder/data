@entity0 -- prosecutors in eastern @entity5 have charged six @entity7 investigators who allegedly drowned a local official during interrogation with intentional assault , the victim 's family told @entity1			1
the news reignites debate over the existence of a secretive extrajudicial process faced by accused @entity7 members			0
@entity16 , 41 , who was the chief engineer of state - owned @entity17 in @entity19 province , died in a local hospital on april 9			1
the night before , the six investigators made @entity16 strip and sit in a bathtub filled with icy water , and then repeatedly held his head under water despite his struggling and cries for help , according to the indictment paper , a copy of which was provided to @entity1 by the @entity16 family			1
the @entity34 branch of the ruling @entity7 's @entity35 had detained @entity16 for more than a month to question his role in a land deal			1
prosecutors in nearby @entity39 , who were assigned the case , said that evidence has clearly shown that , frustrated by his perceived lack of cooperation , the investigators tortured @entity16 in an attempt to extract a confession			1
@entity16 's body was covered with bruises in photos taken in the hospital by a family lawyer			1
the official autopsy sent to the family said @entity16 died of " lung malfunction caused by inhaled fluids , caused by others			1
" " he looked so painfully thin that he became almost unrecognizable , " @entity16 's wife @entity59 told @entity1 , adding that she was disappointed by the authorities ' handling of the aftermath despite the indictment			1
" they came only once after his death and told me they would deal with the case in a civilized way , " she said			2
" during the autopsy and investigation , i was not informed at all			0
" as @entity5 president @entity73 vows to eradicate rampant corruption , @entity16 's case has become the latest example of the controversial " shuanggui " process , which often involves lengthy detention and what critics call brutal treatment of accused officials , especially those who refuse to admit wrongdoings			1
" @entity83 " literally means " dual designation " in @entity5 , which is short for a probe conducted in a designated time and designated location			0
since it is based on the @entity7 's own regulations instead of formal laws and procedures , shuanggui is even less transparent than the party - controlled judicial system			0
recent state media reports have highlighted torture allegations in several shuanggui cases , including the sudden deaths of a court official in @entity100 province in april and a seismological agency director in @entity103 province in june			2
both families have described the officials ' bruised bodies as signs of torture and demanded thorough investigations			0
during his high - profile trial last month , disgraced @entity7 leader @entity110 mentioned making false confessions under pressure while in shuanggui confinement			0
" the investigators took care of me and spoke to me politely , " @entity110 said in his closing remarks , according to a court - released transcript			0
" but i was under pressure during the process			0
" some of @entity110 's courtroom comments expunged from the official account , however , include his detailing of threats made against him and his family by investigators , two individuals with detailed knowledge of the trial told @entity1			1
during his pre-trial incarceration , according to those sources , @entity110 said investigators warned him of the possibility of his wife 's execution and his son 's arrest , and told him about the cases of other prominent officials -- one of whom confessed and was spared , and another who did not cooperate and was executed			2
although many legal experts view the prosecution of @entity16 's alleged torturers as a small step forward , they say the key is to address the root cause of his death			1
" the six investigators arrested were mere scapegoats , " said @entity150 , one of the lawyers representing the @entity16 family , blaming the legal team 's difficulty to access the case files on political sensitivity of the shuanggui issue			1
" @entity83 is an illegal process -- abuse and torture during interrogation have become standard operating procedure			0
" @entity150 calls for the abolition of shuanggui , comparing it to the notorious " laojiao " -- or " re-education through labor " -- another extrajudicial system in @entity5 that allows police to jail offenders in labor camps for up to four years without trial			0
the horrific details of @entity16 's case seem to have jolted ordinary @entity5 citizens into reassessing a procedure that has long been hailed as an effective weapon against corrupt party officials			1
many had just applauded the party leadership 's recent decision to launch corruption investigations against several senior officials tied to the state oil industry , including a member of the elite @entity188 whose sacking was announced earlier this week			2
as @entity193 users condemn @entity16 's torture on social media , a number of state - run news outlets have also voiced their concern over an unchecked process			2
" power without powerful supervision makes everyone a potential victim -- whether you are a subject of the shuanggui rules like @entity16 or an imprisoned former enforcer of those rules , " read a commentary published in the @entity199 on thursday , with an apparent reference to @entity110 , who once governed the southwestern metropolis of @entity202 with an iron fist			2
" cracking down on corruption and punishing the corrupt are the common aspiration of the people , " it added			0
" but no matter how just the end is , it has to be achieved through just means			0
" by thursday night , the article had disappeared from the newspaper 's website			0
