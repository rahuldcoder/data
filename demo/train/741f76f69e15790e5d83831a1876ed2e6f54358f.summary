-- it was the closest comet near - miss known to astronomers , but everything is alright			2
@entity4 shaved past a planet 's surface at one third the distance of the @entity8 to the moon			2
but it was n't @entity8 in the cross hairs -- it was our neighbor @entity14			2
@entity8 got lucky in more than one way			0
with a gang of @entity21 orbiters and rovers on and around @entity14 , their cameras and instruments got a historic front row seat on the comet that @entity21 said made the closest recorded pass ever by any planet			1
the three orbiters are just coming out of hiding			0
the comet came so close that @entity29 , @entity30 and the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) had to duck and cover on the other side of the planet			2
otherwise , @entity4 's debris of dust and gas flying at 126,000 miles per hour just 87,000 miles above @entity14 ' surface could have blasted them like a shotgun			1
they 're all ok , @entity21 said in a statement			0
it will take a few days for them to transfer pictures and data to @entity8			0
the comet does not pose a threat to @entity8 and was headed back out to the outer reaches of the solar system , @entity21 said			0
comet spectators the @entity30 was the first of the spacecraft to report it was unharmed as the comet passed			0
it made observations of the comet before sheltering behind @entity14 , @entity21 said			1
" the spacecraft performed flawlessly throughout the comet flyby , " said @entity30 project manager @entity55 of @entity21 's @entity56			1
" it maneuvered for the planned observations of the comet and emerged unscathed			0
" the @entity30 immediately began to transmit information to @entity8 , but the full downlink could take days , @entity21 said			0
see @entity21 's @entity63 video explaining comet flyby several @entity8 - based and space telescopes , including the @entity66 , also took pictures			1
the @entity21 rovers that are on the surface of @entity14 were protected by @entity14 ' atmosphere , @entity21 said			1
they watched @entity4 much like a spectator would watch a comet flyby here on @entity8 .			1

@entity4 came within 87,000 miles of @entity14 -- close for a comet flyby
@entity21 protected its spacecraft orbiting the planet by having them hide
the first of three @entity21 orbiters reported to be in good health
