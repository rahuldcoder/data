-- the growing @entity4 population in the @entity5 has reached a new milestone , topping 50 million , or 16.3 % of the nation , officially solidifying its position as the country 's second - largest group , @entity2 officials said thursday			1
" overall , we 've learned that our nation 's population has become more racially and ethnically diverse over the past 10 years , " said @entity12 , chief of the bureau 's racial statistics branch			1
several trends emerged from the 2010 census , according to @entity19 , director of the @entity2 , and @entity21 , chief of the population distribution branch			1
the country is growing at a smaller rate			1
growth is concentrated in metropolitan areas and in the @entity27 and @entity28			2
the fastest - growing communities are suburbs such as @entity31 , @entity32 , outside @entity33			0
and standard - bearer cities such as @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 are no longer in the top 20 for population , replaced by upstarts such as @entity41 , @entity42 , and @entity43 , @entity44 , the officials said			2
the most significant trend , however , appeared to be the nation 's new count of 50.5 million latinos , whose massive expansion accounted for more than half of the nation 's overall growth of 27.3 million people , to a new overall @entity5 population of 308.7 million , officials said			1
the @entity4 population grew 43 % since 2000 , officials said			1
in stark contrast , all other populations together grew by only about 5 % , officials said			1
the nation as a whole expanded by 9.7 %			2
@entity2 officials declined thursday to say how much illegal immigration has spurred growth among @entity49 and other minorities , saying the sources of the growth are still being studied			0
" those are actually very excellent questions , " said @entity69 , chief of the bureau 's ethnicity and ancestry branch			0
" we are actually in the middle of the process of investigating that			0
" @entity78 , a senior writer at the @entity79 in @entity80 , said the birth rate , rather than immigration , is the primary driving factor in the @entity4 boom			1
hispanics now account for nearly one - quarter of children under the age of 18 , @entity78 said			0
" hispanics are a younger population , and there are just more women of a child - bearing age , " she said			2
although immigration remains a major contributor to @entity4 population growth , the recent recession and high employment rates may have prompted a tapering off in the rate of foreign - born nationals seeking @entity5 residence , analysts said			1
intensified border patrols may have reduced illegal immigration , but those measures " remain at the margins , " said @entity109 , a demographer at the @entity110			0
he added that @entity5 's overall undocumented immigrant population -- estimated at between 10 million and 11 million people -- may have even declined in recent years , though accurate numbers are difficult to acquire			1
while @entity49 are evidence of a growing voting bloc , they may not necessarily spur immigration reform in @entity118 , which has been paralyzed politically for years on whether to reform immigration laws or roll out additional crackdowns such as a beefed - up border patrol , said one immigrant rights advocate in @entity123			0
" we hope these census numbers signal a new era of racial politics in our states , rooted not only in strong economies but also equalities for all people , " said @entity124 , executive director of the human rights organization @entity125			0
home to the busiest border crossing for illegal immigration , @entity123 has been the nation 's hotbed for several laws targeting illegal immigrants , including the much - publicized @entity142 that is now being challenged on constitutional grounds in federal court because one of its controversial provisions allows racial profiling by police , critics charge			0
several states have tried to pass measures similar to @entity123 's , but not with much success , @entity151 asserted			0
the census figures may dampen further immigration crackdowns in @entity123 because the new population count " demonstrates the growing importance of @entity4 voters throughout the state , " @entity151 said			1
as the census figures are used for congressional redistricting in states , @entity4 voters should not be " written off and treated as disposable constituents , " she added			1
the census data show that while the white population increased by 2.2 million to 196.8 million , its share of the total population dropped to 64 % from 69 % , officials said			1
the @entity174 population also grew 43 % , increasing from 10.2 million in 2000 to 14.7 million in 2010 , officials said			1
@entity175 now account for about 5 % of the nation 's population			1
the @entity180 - @entity27 population , which grew by about 4.3 million , is now about 40 million , or 12.6 % of the population , a slight increase over 12.3 % in 2000 , officials said			1
persons reporting " some other race " grew by 3.7 million , to 19 million , or 5.5 % of the nation , figures show			1
the vast majority of @entity5 , 97 % , reported only one race , with whites as the largest group , accounting for about seven out of 10 @entity5			2
the remaining 3 % of the population reported multiple races , and almost all of them listed exactly two races			1
@entity198 and black was the leading biracial combination , figures show			2
" the face of the country is changing , " said @entity201 , demographer at the @entity79			2
demographic data had already been released for all states except @entity206 and @entity207 and for the @entity80			0
in fast - growing states where whites and blacks dominated past growth , @entity4 are now the greatest growth engine , @entity109 said			1
the significance of the numbers to the @entity5 is more than just an increase of an ethnicity			0
research shows that along with the changing demographics , the country has become more diverse in other ways , @entity201 said			2
for instance , there is a substantial mixing of the @entity27 population through interracial marriage , he said			2
another change is the concentration of the growing populations			0
previously , the @entity4 population was concentrated in eight or nine states ; it is now spread throughout the country , @entity201 said			1
meanwhile , most of the data released so far show decreases in the population of white children , @entity109 said			1
minorities will have a greater presence among future generations , he said			0
for example , in @entity241 , 61 % of children are minorities , compared with 41 % of adults			2
in border states like @entity42 , demographers say , @entity4 populations are expected to surpass @entity248 populations within the next decade			1
" without question , we are becoming a @entity4 state , " said @entity42 state demographer @entity249			1
" i live in @entity253 , and there you see @entity256 advertisements , television shows and newspapers everywhere , " he said			0
in cities and towns across the region , there are @entity256 - speaking restaurants , retailers and annual festivals			0
" it 's helpful to be able to speak a little @entity256 if you 're @entity248 , " @entity249 said			0
" my neighbors do n't really speak much @entity269			0
while my @entity256 is n't great , at least we can interact and be neighbors			0
" but while the labor force may absorb @entity256 - only employees , an emerging debate among policy makers asks whether their children face additional challenges in @entity269 - speaking schools			0
" education attainment is the single best determinant for a whole variety of social outcomes , " said @entity279 , director of research at the @entity281 in @entity80			0
analysts speculate that while population levels swell , comparable growth in education levels may take some time			2
" in @entity292 , @entity291 once had a much higher high school dropout rate , " @entity279 said , noting an @entity291 immigration flux in the @entity5 that spanned the years of 1890 to 1920			0
" it took them 60 to 70 years to lower those levels and close the socioeconomic gap			0
" @entity0 's @entity298 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity4 population is now 50.5 million , or 16 % of the country
the white population is *197* million , dropping to 64 %
