@entity0 , @entity1 -- it only takes the touch of a finger to locate the nearest bank , purchase tickets for a movie or find directions to just about anywhere in the world			2
the digital revolution has changed the way the current generation carries out everyday tasks			1
but some say that convenience has come at the price of your privacy			1
your personal interests and where you shop is valuable data for companies that want to effectively target their direct marketing			2
and it 's not just a matter of companies recording your ip addresses and credit card swipes			1
" almost anything you do in today 's society involves leaving a track , " said @entity31 of the @entity32			1
he 's the director of the @entity32 of @entity1 's @entity36			1
as you go about your daily routine , you inadvertently share more data than you realize			2
" it starts the moment you get up , " @entity31 said			2
" just moving around is tracked			2
if it 's on a bus , and you are paying with bus cards , that can be tracked			1
if you are driving your car , there are increasingly video cameras that recognize license plates			2
anytime you have a cell phone on , it 's talking with cell towers and creating a record of where you are down to 100 feet			1
" and that can put your personal information at a higher risk			2
last year , more than 11 million @entity59 consumers were victims of identity theft , according to an annual survey released last month by @entity62			2
it found that the no. 1 targets are people 18 to 24			2
their salaries might be lower than the older , less digitally savvy generation , but they are more likely to share their personal information online			0
and that is n't always a bad thing			1
private investigator @entity72 argues people are in a sense compensated for the personal information they divulge			0
" the average @entity59 finds a very healthy acceptable balance between privacy and convenience , they give up some privacy and get a lot of convenience , " said @entity72 , who regularly gives a talk at conferences titled , " privacy is dead : get over it ! " @entity72 has become an expert using someone 's digital tracks to locate the person , whether they are a fugitive , a missing person or a writer that @entity72 challenged to try and hide from him for a year			1
@entity72 found him nine times just from electronic bread crumbs he left , and the two are working on a book about the experience			0
it 's very hard to function in society and not leave those kinds of clues , @entity72 said			1
" if you want to have access to the largest , most fantastic marketplace in the world , @entity103 has to know what you have searched for , " @entity72 said			0
" if you want to be able pull a phone out of your pocket and talk on it anytime you want , well , that phone reports where you are 24/7			1
if it 's a smart phone like an @entity115 or an @entity117 phone , it tell us where you eat , what books you buy , what restaurants you like			1
" but is it possible for someone who truly wanted to go off the grid to avoid leaving any tracks ? @entity125 helps people who are desperate enough do just that			1
" i teach people how to disappear , " @entity125 explained			0
for more than 20 years , @entity125 was a skip tracer ; his job was to track down people who had skipped town			1
then he realized there was opportunity in aiding people who did n't want to be found			1
@entity125 is something like a one - man witness protection program			0
for a fee , he helps people with personal or financial problems , but who are not wanted by law enforcement , vanish			0
he has also written a book , " how to disappear			0
" one of the people @entity125 said he helped disappear was a female attorney being threatened by a client who blamed her when he lost his case in court			0
" he turned his anger on her , basically started throwing dead animals on her lawn , " @entity125 said			0
" the problem with stalkers is there are no boundaries			0
you do n't know where , how or if it 's going to end			1
" in cases like those , @entity125 says he sets up new identities for people so they ca n't be tracked down by someone like him			1
" if i am looking for you , you have got some problems			0
but if i am helping you to get out of town , you 're going to be ok because i know what they are looking for , " he said			0
" the key is your old life and your new life never connect			0
" but odds are it wo n't be an easy life			1
@entity171 , a writer and editor for @entity173 , decided last year to test out the idea of living without leaving a trace			1
he dared his readers to find him			0
@entity171 moved across the country living under false identities , trying not to leave any electronic clues			1
" i think in the first few hours of it i thought , ' no one 's really paying attention , no one cares about this topic , ' " @entity171 said			1
" then the flood started			0
" dozens of strangers formed social media search parties and traded tips about so - called " @entity171 sightings			0
" " one post after another , they had already started digging up information about me , " @entity171 said			0
" after about the first night , i was fully freaked out			0
" he did n't make it easy , using prepaid cell phones , physical disguises and software that masked his internet usage			1
eventually he was tracked down in @entity200 , @entity201 , living under an assumed name , 2,000 miles from where he started			0
@entity171 said paranoia and suspicion quickly set in when he was on the run			0
there was little romance to living like a fugitive , he said			0
" it 's hard to let go of that idea that if you really did it right , you could end up on a beach in @entity214 for the rest of your life drinking margaritas , " he said			2
" that 's always still there , but i think the actual process of living on the run in the @entity59 -- in the end , it 's almost never going to be worth it			2

@entity32 official : " almost anything you do in today 's society involves leaving a track "
cell phone can leave record of your travels even if you are n't making or taking calls
one expert points out *reward* for less privacy is highly convenient *lifestyle*
*experiment* by writer shows disappearing without a trace is difficult to pull off in digital age
