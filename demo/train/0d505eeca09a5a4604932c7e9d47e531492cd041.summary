@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's traditional iron - handed approach to the media has taken a surprise turn of tolerance with @entity8 's soft handling of a recent dispute with local reporters , in what could well become a more open attitude toward the media under the incoming administration of presumed new president @entity15			1
the new openness is being driven in large part by pragmatism , as the government realizes that both traditional and newer media can serve as powerful tools for achieving many of its goals in the country 's modernization			1
the recent conflict between reporters at the progressive @entity28 and local propaganda officials over a censorship incident left many guessing how the government would respond to the first clash of its kind in @entity1 for more than 20 years			1
the result was a surprisingly mild approach , including mediation by a high - level government official and a vague promise for less censorship in the future			0
the unusually tolerant tack could well reflect a new attitude by @entity15 and other incoming leaders set to take control of @entity1 for the next decade , all of whom have come to realize the media can serve many important functions beyond its traditional role as a propaganda machine			1
at the top of @entity15 's list is the fight against corruption , a problem he has mentioned frequently since taking the helm of the @entity57 last year			1
the party has tried to tackle the problem for years using its own internal investigations , but progress was slow until recently due to protection many officials received through their own sprawling networks of internal relationships , known locally as guanxi			0
all that began to change in the last two years with the rapid rise of social media , most notably the @entity70 - like microblogs known as @entity71 that are now a pervasive part of the @entity74 landscape and count hundreds of millions of ordinary @entity1 among their users			1
those social media have become an important weapon for exposing corruption , allowing thousands of ordinary citizens to pool their resources and build cases against officials they suspect of using their influence for personal gain			1
this increasingly sophisticated machine was on prominent display last year in a case involving @entity90 , a local official in northwestern @entity92 province who infuriated the online community by smiling at the site of a horrific accident scene			0
@entity96 quickly turned their outrage into an online investigation , and uncovered photos of him wearing several luxury watches he could hardly afford on his government salary			0
as a result , the government ultimately opened an investigation into the matter and @entity90 was sacked from his posts			0
in addition to its role in battling corruption , the media has also emerged as an important tool for combating and addressing many of the other social problems that @entity1 is facing in its rapid modernization			1
barely a week goes by without a report on the latest national food safety scandal or case of illegal pollution in both traditional and social media , with such reports often followed by government investigations			2
@entity8 leaders have also discovered that the media can also be an important vehicle for improving communication between the government and general public -- something that was a low priority in previous eras when officials only cared about pleasing their higher - up party bosses			2
following a @entity8 directive in late 2011 , most local government agencies and other organizations have all established microblog accounts , which they use to keep the public informed about their latest activities and seek feedback on upcoming plans			0
such input has become a valuable way to temper traditional public mistrust toward the government , which historically did n't make much effort to include the public in any of its internal discussions			0
lastly , the government has also discovered that media , especially social media , can be an effective tool in gauging public opinion on everything from broader national topics like inflation down to very local issues like land redevelopment			2
such feedback was difficult to get in the past due to interference by local officials , who tried to filter out or downplay anything with negative overtones and play things up to their own advantage			0
as a result , central government officials often received incomplete pictures of what was happening in their own country			0
with all of these valuable roles to play , the media has become an increasingly important part of @entity8 's strategy in executing many of its top priorities			2
the government also realizes that a certain degree of openness is critical to letting the media perform many of those roles , which may explain its relatively tolerant approach in the recent @entity28 conflict			2
such tolerance is likely to continue under @entity15 's administration , helping to shift more power towards a field of increasingly emboldened reporters at both traditional and new media and away from their traditional propaganda masters			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			0
