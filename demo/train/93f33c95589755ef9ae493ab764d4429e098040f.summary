-- when @entity3 organizers announced that the destruction wreaked by @entity5 would not cause the cancellation of sunday 's prestigious race , few people will have been as relieved as @entity8			1
the @entity9 is a man on a mission -- he ran five marathons on five continents before making it to the @entity14 , and cycled the last leg of the journey from @entity17			1
sunday 's race will be his sixth in less than 30 days , all run to honor the memory of his late fiancee and provide an education for @entity25 children			1
" there are fallen trees , electricity poles and stuff like that , " the 34 - year - old told @entity0 from the roadside after the hurricane had caused widespread disruption along the east coast of the @entity31 " it has certainly made it more interesting			2
i imagine the fine people of @entity41 will show their character and come out and represent			0
i 'm sure it will be a special occasion			0
" the superstorm has claimed more than 140 lives across @entity46 and the @entity47 , but that has not deterred @entity8 as he moves closer to the final 26.2 miles of his task			1
" i think people thought we were daft when we said we were going to cycle from @entity17 to @entity41 , but now they know why , as we could n't have flown to @entity41 , " he said after arriving in the @entity31 on tuesday			0
" there has n't been too much of a chance to get a sense of people			0
obviously it is all over the news and i think people , especially here on the eastern seaboard , are a little bit shellshocked			0
" his global quest began in @entity65 on october 7 with the @entity67 marathon			0
he has since completed a punishing schedule which included races in @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and the @entity73			0
the long road @entity8 has traveled began in 2006 when his bride - to - be @entity75 was killed in a cycling accident on her way home from work in @entity9			1
@entity8 established " @entity83 " in her memory to help bring clean water to a region of @entity25			1
" i was fortunate enough to get a lot of time off work and i wanted to do something worthwhile with it , " explains @entity8			1
" i worked with the charity @entity87 to establish a project in @entity25 , which is now up and running			1
as a result of that being set up , children no longer need to spend all day collecting water			0
so there 's now a shortage of classrooms			1
" the shortage gave birth to @entity99 's latest fundraising venture , which he hopes will generate enough money to build four classrooms in the @entity104 area of @entity25			1
he set off with the aim of raising Â £ 10,000 ( $ 16,000 ) , but he is close to doubling that figure			2
to date , @entity8 has collected around Â £ 18,000 in his " adventure of a lifetime			1
" @entity8 comes from a family with running pedigree -- his father @entity112 is a former 5,000 meters world record - holder and was a pacemaker when fellow @entity116 @entity115 became the first man to run one mile in under four minutes in 1954			1
" i wanted to do every marathon close to the three hours and 45 minutes target , " @entity8 said			1
" i thought it was pushing myself close to the limit while also being able to sustain it			0
all of them have been there or thereabouts , my legs have held up to the rigors of it			0
" @entity8 might not have met that target -- clocking four hours and 45 minutes for the @entity131 marathon in @entity72 -- but he did achieve something even his father and the great @entity115 would have struggled with			2
in his schedule , the @entity131 and @entity135 marathons were numbers four and five respectively , which presented a problem			2
the two races were on consecutive days and being staged on different continents			2
" the @entity131 marathon was at seven on sunday , " he explains			2
" i went to the start line in the knowledge i was up against the finest marathon - running nation on the planet , so knew i was on a bit of a hiding to nothing			2
" i daubed myself down with a wet wipe , much to the disappointment of my fellow passengers on the five - hour flight from @entity131 to @entity153			0
" i had six hours on the ground there and just tried to get as much water as i could and some food inside me and stretch my legs			0
i took off from there at 2:30 a.m. and landed in @entity135 at 6:45 a.m. " i got changed at the airport , met friends and family at the start line and i managed to get around the @entity135 marathon in three hours and 38 minutes on slightly weary , but thankfully forgiving , legs			0
" so with just @entity41 left to tick off on this testing trip , what is next for this @entity168 ? " sleep and beer , " he replies			0
