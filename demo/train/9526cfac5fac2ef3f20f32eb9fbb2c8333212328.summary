a series of errors by pilots and a failure to react effectively to technical problems led to the crash of @entity8 , @entity1 's @entity0 said thursday in its final report on the disaster			1
the @entity12 - to - @entity1 flight plunged into the @entity13 on june 1 , 2009 , killing all 228 people on board			1
the report details how the pilots failed to respond effectively to problems with the plane 's speed sensors or to correct its trajectory when things first started to go wrong			1
when ice crystals blocked the plane 's pitot tubes , which are part of a system used to determine air speed , the autopilot disconnected and the pilots did not know how to react to what was happening , the report said			1
" the occurrence of the failure in the context of flight in cruise completely surprised the crew of flight af 447 , " the report said			1
the crew responded by over-handling the aircraft , which destabilized its flight path and caused further confusing readings , the report said			1
" in the first minute after the autopilot disconnection , the failure of the attempt to understand the situation and the disruption of crew cooperation had a multiplying effect , inducing total loss of cognitive control of the situation			2
" the @entity55 went into a sustained stall , signaled by a warning message and strong buffeting of the aircraft , the report said			2
" despite these persistent symptoms , the crew never understood they were in a stall situation and therefore never undertook any recovery maneuvers			0
" the pilots responded to the situation by pointing the nose upward , rather than downward , to recover			0
the report makes 25 new safety recommendations , on top of a number made in an initial report last year			1
some of the recommendations have already been implemented , but it could take years for others fully to come into effect , chief investigator @entity72 told reporters as he introduced the report			1
opinion : why do planes still crash ? the international aeronautic community will likely focus on the crew 's loss of awareness of what was going on , @entity72 said			0
the use of automatic systems on planes has improved safety overall , he explained , but " when it comes down to it , safety will always be based on the capacity of the pilots and the signals which they are given , which they have to understand and react to			1
" it was an " exceptional " inquiry because of the scale of the disaster , the number of countries involved and the difficulty of locating the plane 's data recorders , he said			0
the intense media coverage of the crash added to the pressure , @entity72 said			0
it 's a crash that never should have happened , said @entity112 's aviation specialist @entity111			0
the industry will be studying the human factors of the crew on the plane for many years to come			0
the @entity0 said its report does not examine the issue of responsibility for the crash , which is the subject of a separate judicial inquiry			1
history 's deadliest plane crashes the icing - up of the pitot tubes was " a phenomenon that was known but misunderstood by the aviation community at the time of the accident , " the report pointed out			0
pilots should be trained on how to handle this event and a high - altitude stall with better technical instruction and flight simulator programs , the report said			1
airplane ergonomics should also be improved , it said , " to provide guidance to crews to help them recognize and manage unusual situations			0
" international communications systems should also be reviewed to ensure swifter response and recovery efforts after accidents at sea , the report said			0
it took four searches over the course of nearly two years to locate the bulk of @entity8 's wreckage and the majority of the bodies in a mountain range deep under the ocean			2
the aircraft 's voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered from the ocean floor in may 2011 after an extensive search using miniature submersible vehicles			1
the @entity0 said the data indicated that @entity8 crashed because the aircraft 's speed sensors gave invalid readings			1
who 's really flying the plane ? last year 's report from the bureau said the airplane climbed to 38,000 feet when " the stall warning was triggered and the airplane stalled			2
" it then descended , crashing into the @entity13			2
the descent lasted three minutes and 30 seconds , and the engines remained operational , the report said			0
studies of the debris and bodies found soon after the crash led the @entity1 agency to conclude the plane hit the water belly first , essentially intact			1
oxygen masks were not deployed , indicating that the cabin did not depressurize , the bureau said in a 2009 report			2
flight 447 was passing through an area prone to volatile and dangerous weather known as the @entity192 when it went down			0
the zone is a belt of low pressure that wraps around the planet			0
clouds and storms form along it because it is literally where the winds of the world 's hemispheres meet			0
pilot : ' damn it , we 're going to crash ' a previous report from the @entity1 agency also raised questions about the training of the pilots on the flight			1
the recorders revealed the pilots had failed to discuss repeated stall warnings and " had received no high altitude training " to deal with the situation , the bureau said			0
they failed to regain control of the aircraft , and no announcement was made to the passengers , of 32 different nationalities , before it plummeted from the sky			0
how did you react to the report ? sound off on @entity226 .			2

investigators make 25 new safety recommendations in their final report
the pilots ' failure to react effectively to technical problems led to the crash , the report says
@entity8 crashed in 2009 en route from @entity12 to @entity1
the flight recorder was recovered last year from the bottom of the @entity13
