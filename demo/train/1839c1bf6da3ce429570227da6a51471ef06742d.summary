-- it sounds like something made up just in time for @entity3			2
several reports from @entity5 of attacks by people dressed as clowns -- and armed with anything from knives to baseball bats -- have been making headlines in @entity13			1
taken with the recent sightings reported by some communities in @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 , among others , it is easy to wonder what is going on			0
what is it about clowns ? why these strange sightings now ? but to those of us who have been following what is proving to be an unusually lively period of clown reports -- whether they be actual crimes or simply hoaxes -- neither the reports themselves , nor the peculiar interest in these incidents , is all that surprising			1
for a start , while these developments are notable , the recent outbreak of such activity is actually not without precedent			0
in the mid- 1980s , for example , a number of episodes were recorded on both sides of the @entity46 , first in @entity47 and then in various towns across @entity49 , as people reported clowns in ice cream vans attempting to lure children			2
we also know that clowns inhabit fertile ground in terms of phobias -- after all , they can invoke anything from a fear of masks , to stranger danger , to our anxieties regarding public humiliation			2
( and that 's not to mention the question of why a grown person would dress this way , in a kind of asexual fetishism )			2
meanwhile , the @entity71 , the professional organization representing @entity73 clowns , has reported a significant decline in the number of students attending clown school in recent years			1
so it is possible , then , that these two elements -- the decline in " licensed " clown performers and the rise in the number of " sinister " sightings -- are more closely related than they seem			0
after all , all forms of monstrosity are essentially commentaries on the nature of humanity 's social relations ( the twilight books and movies , for example , offer a straightforward examination of adolescent sexuality explored through the lens of a vampire / human / werewolf menage			0
) indeed , in many ways , the crisis in the clown community mirrors the anxieties that are felt across many sectors of society -- class friction , social estrangement and an economy many still feel uncertain over			1
keep in mind that clowns have always been marginal members of society			1
in the @entity111 , the fool was a scapegoat and outcast , an egregious misfit with license to speak truth to power			0
in the 20th century , the two greatest clowns were essentially homeless indigents : " @entity122 , " the unshaven and ragged hobo clown of @entity122 , emerged straight from the @entity119 , while @entity120 was known simply as " the @entity121			1
" in all these instances , clowns enjoy a relationship to society that is tenuous at best			1
in this sense , it is no great leap to say that dressing up as a scary clown is an expression of anti-social alienation , especially when coupled with another phenomenon that we might term " industrial nostalgia			0
" the stereotypical scary clown almost always takes its inspiration from clowns associated with the golden age of the @entity73 big top circus			1
these white face clowns with their colorful hair and costumes are known as " @entity145 " in honor of the great comedian , @entity147 , and evoke a specific time in @entity73 history , a time of optimism and potential			0
but this golden age has passed , and our ideas of clowns are now set against a backdrop of recession , social atomization and a distrust of traditional institutions			1
when seen from the vantage point of the present , the @entity161 of the big top seem hopelessly naive , the leering remnants of an industrial past whose promises are unfulfilled			0
it also seems no coincidence that the narratives that employ scary clowns so often associate them with failed businesses -- empty music halls echoing with the ghosts of past laughter or abandoned theme parks repurposed as lairs			0
the idea of the scary clown , then , taps into the frustrations and fears of a time in which so many are feeling themselves pushed into the margins			1
so , should you think you see a clown peering through your curtains this @entity3 , take comfort in the fact that it 's nothing personal			2
the image of that grinning , shock - haired psychopath you are imagining is in your wardrobe will probably start to fade when the economy turns around			0
