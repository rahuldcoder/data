-- " @entity1 " is already making critics cheer			1
the follow - up to 2011 's surprise hit " @entity7 " wo n't open until july 11 , but early reviews and strong box office predictions are setting it up for a splashy debut			1
as the sequel to " rise , " " @entity1 " takes place 10 years following the events of that 2011 movie			1
in this future existence , the apes , led by @entity14 , have built a functioning society in the woods of @entity19 's @entity18 , while humans have suffered a severe blow from a global virus			2
when the survivors stumble upon the apes ' community , there 's an initial attempt to keep the peace , but it is n't long before the dawn of a war			2
in addition to @entity33 , who received plenty of praise for his work in " @entity7 , " " @entity37 " also stars @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40			1
interestingly , it 's not the human cast that 's really driven critics bananas			1
" few blockbusters this summer are likely to provide an image as stirring as an angry chimp on horseback , leaping through a wall of fire with a machine gun blazing in each hand -- in @entity53 , " @entity45 's review begins			2
" both the forest settings and post-apocalyptic @entity56 are rich in detail and atmosphere , the action sequences are thrilling without being flashy , and the apes themselves are uncannily expressive , particularly their eyes			0
... we 've arrived at the stage where the soulful expression on the face of a virtual chimp can conjure more sympathy than a real , emoting human			0
" @entity70 's @entity69 goes as far as to call " @entity37 " one of the best movies of 2014 , thanks to its combination of digital expertise and talented direction from @entity77			1
while @entity69 entered his screening just wanting " a solid and respectful follow - up , " what he got instead was " a film that digs deep , that challenges not only the notion of what a studio blockbuster looks like but also how sequels are supposed to work in a commercial world , a movie about real ideas with a spectacular sense of character and mood			2
' @entity37 ' is not just a good genre movie or a good summer movie			0
it 's a great science - fiction film , full - stop			0
" and the effort to make the apes as realistic as possible " pushed performance into a whole new realm , " @entity69 continues			0
" it 's one thing to pull off one or two characters like this , but ... to bring to life dozens of characters , and to have them all register as fully as they do here , is a remarkable accomplishment			0
add to that the idea that so much of this was shot outside , on real locations , and you end up with something that destroys any boundaries in terms of what can or ca n't be done at this point			0
" to put it another way , " ' @entity37 ' is to ' @entity7 ' what ' @entity119 ' was to ' @entity122 ' â € ” it 's that much better , " says the @entity121			1
" [ @entity125 ] irector @entity77 ' synthesis of brains and brawn kicks it over the goalposts and out of the stadium ... whatever anyone might think about the film as a whole , there is no question that @entity33 gives the most expressive , soulful , deeply felt performance of a non-human character the big screen has ever offered as the mature @entity14			0
" with praise like that , it 's no wonder box office prognosticators are imagining huge returns when " @entity1 " opens on july 11			1
according to @entity144 , many observers believe " @entity37 " will easily grab a $ 54.8 million opening , with @entity146 placing its bets that " @entity37 's " first weekend will land close to $ 70 million .			0
