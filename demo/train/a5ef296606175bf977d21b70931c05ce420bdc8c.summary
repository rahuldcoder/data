-- on the night where one of the club 's greats may have played his final game , a new star shone brightly			0
@entity6 may have appeared in the famous red shirt for the last time in his illustrious career although the 40 - year - old has yet to confirm his retirement			1
@entity6 , who has presided over the team as interim manager since the sacking of @entity14 , looked emotional as he spoke to supporters following the 3 - 1 victory against @entity17			1
it was a night when @entity6 gave youth its chance and was repaid handsomely as 18 - year - old @entity21 gave a glimpse of the future			1
@entity21 , who has progressed through the ranks at @entity25 , scored twice on his debut -- not bad for a player who was n't even born when @entity6 won his first title with @entity29			1
@entity6 ' future is unclear with just one match of the season remaining -- and he looked to be feeling the emotion during his short speech			1
" i 'd just like to say a big thank you from all the players and all the staff for your support this year , " @entity6 said as he addressed the crowd at the end of the game			2
" we know it 's been tough this season and over the years we 've been spoiled with the success we 've had , but you 've always supported the team and the staff , and i 'm sure in the coming years we 'll bring you more success			0
" i 'd just like to say keep supporting us , you 've seen a little glimpse of the future , we always play attractive football -- keep supporting us and the good times will come back soon			0
" @entity6 , the most decorated player in the history of @entity57 football , has won 13 league titles with @entity29 , two @entity60 crowns and a host of cups since making his debut as a teenager against @entity65 in march 1991			1
a one - club man , the @entity67 has become synonymous with the @entity69 era where @entity29 dominated @entity71 football			2
he will now await to see who the club bring in to replace @entity14 on a permanent basis -- but whoever takes over appears to have found a gem in young @entity21			0
the striker , who has scored goals for @entity29 's younger teams throughout his time at the club , is one of the most highly - rated young @entity71 players in the country			1
a regular for the @entity86 under - 19 side , @entity21 showed his class to net twice before @entity88 secured victory			1
it was also an emotional night for defender @entity91			2
the @entity93 defender was given a great send - off by the home crowd following his final appearance in an @entity29 shirt at @entity25			1
the 32 - year - old , who will join @entity99 at the end of the season , established himself as one of the best defenders in the @entity104 after arriving from @entity105 in 2005			2
@entity91 won five league titles and the 2008 @entity60 during his time with the club but will test himself in @entity109 's @entity108 " i had so many great times here , " @entity91 told the crowd			2
" it is hard to speak because of the emotions			0
most importantly i would like to thank the players , the manager and all the coaches			0
thank you for everything and especially to the fans , you have been fantastic to me all these years			0
" @entity121 shock meanwhile , in @entity109 , minnow @entity121 produced an astonishing 4 - 3 victory away at @entity124 to secure three vital points in its battle against relegation			0
@entity129 scored a hat - trick for the visiting team and while @entity132 managed his first goal since returning from injury , @entity124 was unable to stave off defeat			0
that result ends @entity124 's hopes of qualifying for next season 's @entity60 -- which was confirmed by third - place @entity140 's win over @entity141			0
@entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 scored the goals to wrap up a comfortable 3 - 0 win for the home side .			1
