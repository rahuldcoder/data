-- the bogeyman of judicial activism is back in the news			1
we owe the latest round of charges to the chorus of commentators , activists and politicians — now led by president @entity11 himself — fearful that the @entity14 @entity13 will upend part or all of his signature health care law			1
like most accusations of activism against the courts , these pre-emptive attacks shed no real light on the constitutional questions at stake			0
indeed , it is time to admit how useless — or worse — the epithet of judicial activism is			1
echoing other critics , @entity11 claimed that a ruling against the @entity31 would be " unprecedented and extraordinary " and complained that " an unelected group of people would somehow overturn a duly constituted and passed law			1
" let 's assume the president did not actually mean to imply that no properly enacted law could ever legitimately be found unconstitutional			2
instead , let 's examine the broader picture those decrying activism mean to paint : one of an imperial judiciary routinely snatching important policy decisions out of the hands of elected representatives			0
a 2011 @entity48 study , " government unchecked : the false problem of ' @entity57 ' and the need for @entity59 , " compared the number of laws struck down by the @entity13 to the number of laws passed by @entity54 and state legislatures			1
from 1954 to 2002 , the court struck down , in whole or in part , just two - thirds of one percent of laws passed by @entity54 and less than one - twentieth of a percent of laws passed by state legislatures			2
over those five decades , the court struck , on average , just two federal and nine state laws per year			0
@entity69 : @entity13 's @entity11 order a ' hissy fit ' these tiny numbers and percentages of laws struck are generally consistent over time — including into the @entity76 era , as a different data set with more recent rulings shows			1
in the balance of power between the elected and judicial branches , the scales tip heavily toward @entity54 and state legislatures			0
nothing the court might do in the health care case will change that			1
by the numbers , charges of rampant judicial activism are wildly overblown			1
worse , they typically serve as a partisan club intended to foreclose healthy debate on constitutional questions			0
@entity11 attempted to hoist conservatives — for years , advocates of judicial " restraint " and " minimalism " — with their own petard			2
but this game of gotcha just shows how " judicial activism " has become code for " decisions i do n't like			1
" both sides play the activism card and demand deference to democratic outcomes , when they like them			1
claims of judicial activism have become a substitute for serious thought about the constitutionality of legislative and executive actions , and one that leads to ever - expanding government power			2
that 's the true meaning of " deference			0
" but in our system of government , courts are meant to be " bulwarks " of liberty , not rubber stamps for government power			0
@entity11 gave the game away when he attempted to walk back his initial comments by pointing out that , since the @entity128 , the @entity13 has rarely , if ever , struck down economic legislation			2
video : aide : @entity11 knows the law that is precisely the problem			2
as the 11th @entity14 @entity138 observed in striking down the individual mandate , when @entity54 exceeds the outer bounds of its authority , " the @entity135 requires judicial engagement , not judicial abdication			0
" it is no accident that president @entity11 and other supporters of the health care law are jumping on the judicial activism bandwagon now			1
but years of judicial abdication in the economic realm should not justify more			0
if the @entity13 strikes down part or all of the @entity31 , it will not do much to upset the balance of power between the judicial and elected branches			0
it might , however , be a small but important step toward jettisoning years of misguided restraint and once again taking constitutional limits on government power seriously			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160 .			0

@entity160 : judicial activism charges raised by many over health care and @entity13
she says @entity11 , others warn ruling against health care act would overturn duly passed law
she says her firm 's study found such " activism " does n't exist . few laws *felled* by court
@entity160 : both sides slam " activism , " demand democratic outcomes , when they like them
