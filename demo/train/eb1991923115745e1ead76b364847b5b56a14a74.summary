-- in the country that ranks second in the harvest of coca , the plant whose leaves are used in the production of cocaine , the idea to get @entity8 farmers to plant alternative crops is not new			1
traditionally , the idea has been met with criticism -- why would growers switch to crops that bring less income , economists ask -- but may have finally found a foothold in @entity8 , thanks to the success of a growing industry in cacao beans , used in the production of chocolate			1
in the upper @entity8 @entity30 forest , in the north - central region of @entity28 , cacao has become a hit , eclipsing the allure of growing coca			1
" some 99 percent of the producers in @entity35 were dedicated to producing coca , " said @entity34 , of the @entity35			0
now , he said , it is cacao that has become " a very strong engine of growth			1
" the transformation was the result of years of programs , backed by the @entity46 , which appear to have paid off			0
in october , the @entity35 , located in the @entity28 , won a prestigious award from the @entity49 in @entity50 for the most aromatic cacao beans , beating competitors from @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			1
the distinction is bringing even more attention to the region locally and abroad , as first reported by @entity59 this month			0
the shift from coca to cacao is significant in a country that has supplied so much coca to international drug trafficking organizations that turn the leaves into cocaine to be smuggled north to the @entity68 and elsewhere			2
" the province of @entity70 is one that suffered many years of terrorism and narcotrafficking , " @entity34 said			0
" i think now our country is heading on a good route			0
" there is much room to grow , he added			0
already between 2006 and 2009 , exports of cacao beans increased from 16 metric tons to 250 metric tons			1
@entity34 estimated that export figure will reach 600 metric tons this year , and even more in the years ahead			0
@entity8 exports of cacao products were almost $ 67 million in 2009 , according to an association of cacao growers , most of it going to @entity89 chocolate makers			1
part of the reason for the switch , @entity34 said , are the high prices that cacao sells for			0
he would n't speculate whether cacao beans pay more than coca production , but he noted other benefits , such as security and access to legal markets , that helped make cacao a winner in the area			1
but is the success enough to turn @entity8 away from coca for good ? " undoubtedly there have been some successes , but it 's not going to resolve the coca problem , " said economist @entity105			2
@entity110 has become the star alternative crop in the @entity28 , but in other areas where coca grows , like the @entity115 in south - central @entity8 , cacao has not caught on in the same way			1
there are high - quality beans that can be cultivated in many parts of @entity8 , @entity105 said , but in most cases it is difficult to transport to markets in @entity8 and abroad			2
in the same way that some feel secure by trading coca production for cacao , growers in areas with a stronger presence of traffickers can be intimidated into continuing with coca production , he said			2
unlike the north , in southern @entity8 , coca fields greatly outnumber cacao fields			1
" unfortunately , coca continues to be no. 1 in the valley of the @entity115 , " @entity105 said			0
meanwhile , production in @entity8 in the subsequent steps in drug production , such as processing the coca leaves into cocaine paste and then into cocaine hydrochloride , have increased in recent years , he said			2
@entity8 also remains the second largest producer of coca in the world , behind @entity146			1
the bottom line , according to @entity148 , who sells @entity8 - made chocolate in the @entity151 area , is " that whole region of @entity28 and @entity153 used to grow a lot of coca			1
now it grows a lot of cacao			0
" @entity148 , owner of @entity8 chocolates , buys his product from a factory that makes the chocolate in @entity28 , the same place where the raw materials are			2
the success of the @entity28 region shows that if governments spent more time nourishing alternative development instead of crop eradication , change can come , according to supporters of such programs			0
" this can be replicated in other parts of the country , " @entity148 said			0
and , supporters hope , to other major coca - producing countries .			0

cacao beans can be a better crop than coca plants for farmers , some say
@entity110 " a very strong engine of growth " in upper @entity8 @entity30 forest
chocolate industry can provide a legal and safe source of income , backers say
@entity8 remains second largest producer of coca in the world
