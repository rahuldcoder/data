-- " i only really have one really major regret , " @entity0 tells @entity1 's @entity2			1
" and it was i had the opportunity to spend a birthday with @entity6 , and i did n't			1
" the actress and co-host of " @entity9 " is a guest on wednesday 's " @entity10			1
" @entity0 said she did n't have an exact reason , other than to lament , " i was young and dumb and -- and he passed like a couple of weeks later			1
and it devastated me because i thought ; you know what , that 's what you get			0
" i just remember that he had been so good to me			0
and we were really , you know , good friends			0
and i -- i should have gone			0
" she also called @entity6 an " amazing performer " who could " do everything			0
" @entity2 asked @entity0 whether @entity6 was the " greatest all - around entertainer that we 've seen			1
" " there are maybe three or four , in my lifetime , that were extraordinary dancers and singers and actors and performers , " she said			0
she mentioned @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38			0
the actress also talked about her well - known fear of flying			1
" i feel like i should n't be flying , " said @entity0			1
" i should be rolling in my bus			0
" she said her fear was instilled nearly 30 years ago when she witnessed a mid-air collision while standing on a balcony in @entity45			1
the actress said that what frightened her so much was that " the people on the plane were aware that they were in some danger			0
" she said she particularly fears for people " who see something that they 're not sure they 're going to be able to live through			0
" " and so i -- i just -- @entity57 -- that 's what stayed in my mind , " @entity0 said			1
" because i 'm a visualist			0
so if i see it , it lives in my brain			0
so i always see it			0
" she said her fears were somewhat alleviated by a course offered by @entity68 that helps individuals work through issues surrounding fear of flying			1
for decades , @entity0 traveled back and forth from @entity72 to @entity73 via private bus			1
with two drivers , she was able to arrive on the other coast in 23 hours			0
" some people are meant to fly			0
and i do n't know if i was meant to fly , but i do it now			1
" @entity0 has no choice but to fly in the near future -- she is producing a stage version of her 1992 hit movie " @entity83			1
" it premieres on @entity85 on april 20 and is set to open soon in @entity86 , @entity87 ; @entity88 , @entity89 ; and @entity90			0
another one of @entity0 's quirks is her self - proclaimed refusal to eat " anything that could be hiding something			1
" she said she does n't " like anything that has a weird consistency			1
" for example ? " creamed corn			0
i do n't understand the point			2
" i do n't understand sauce , because you could hide stuff in sauce			2
like , i like my food naked			0
" @entity2 brought up relationships and @entity0 's three marriages			1
" the first one lasted six years , " said @entity2			2
" the second one lasted two years			2
and the last one lasted a year			0
" @entity0 responded by saying " i suppose that , you know , you have to actually be in love with the person that you marry			1
you have to really be committed to them			0
and i 'm just -- i do n't have that commitment			2
i 'm committed to my family , you know , and so -- hence , for that relationship has lasted , you know , the longest			0
" @entity0 admitted that she was n't in love with her husbands and that she married them because she " wanted to feel normal			1
and it seemed to me that if i was married , i 'd have a much normal -- more normal life			1
but clearly , that 's not the case			0
there 's not a good reason to get married			2
you have to actually want a life with someone through ups and downs			0
and i -- i just discovered that was n't for me			2
" she said has been in love only once but would not elaborate other than to say that it was with a man			2
he 's not famous , she 's still in close contact with him , but they are just friends -- he 's married and had a family with another woman , she said			2
when @entity2 expressed his sorrow over the fact that it never worked out , @entity0 said " lots of other things did			1
so i did n't do too badly			2
" @entity0 was asked about the recent " @entity151 " magazine report that said she was the most popular host of " @entity9 , " and she 's more well - liked than @entity152			1
" well , i -- you know , i mean i 'm thankful , " said @entity0			1
but i do n't know really what it means			2
" so is @entity0 a " @entity156 in the morning ? " " i do n't think of myself as @entity157 , but i do think that sometimes i see things from a different perspective , sometimes because of my race , sometimes because of my gender , sometimes because of my experiences			1
