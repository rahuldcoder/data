@entity0 -- @entity2 , one of the hottest and most controversial comedians two decades ago , sits on his front porch late at night , plotting his comeback			1
" i was almost like self - exiled from the business , you know , other than going out and making a living for myself , i was n't really making any career moves , " @entity2 says , talking with fellow comedian @entity6			1
" i was bringing up my family			0
" @entity6 , who was on " @entity12 " with " @entity2 " in 2009 , had his camera rolling when @entity2 invited @entity1 to hang with him a recent friday night -- just days before his first television comedy special in 17 years airs on @entity15			1
" i want to be able to make people laugh as hard as they possibly can , and i really think they need that , " @entity2 said			1
his tv special premieres at 10 p.m. @entity24 " so people can just have a couple of drinks and just laugh until it hurts			1

critics frequently scorned him , calling his act racist , misogynist and homophobic			0
his jokes about gays , women and midgets are still there in his new material			0
" i make no apologies for anything i did on that special , or any joke i tell because that 's the thing about jokes , " he said			1
" that 's all it 's meant to be taken as			1
whether they 're clean , dirty , it 's just humor			1
you know , it 's just jokes			1
this society today , the politically correct , i think people are just sick of it			0
" politically incorrect jokes , however , have seriously hurt comic careers in recent years			1
think @entity90 and the @entity91 in @entity0			0
or @entity92 and his anti-gay humor			0
" some of these comics are on like @entity96 or @entity97 , so , you know , it 's the powers - that - be that turn around and go ' you 've got to apologize for what you said			2
" and that 's just wrong because , you know , comedy is like the last art form where you can get up there and just do whatever you want			2
you know , like they say , you are the producer , director , writer , star			0
and if they take that away , you know , that 's what @entity118 is , that 's what we were built on , freedom			2
" @entity2 knows what it is like for a network to turn on him for his humor			1
@entity127 banned him " for life " after his performance on a 1989 @entity127 awards show			0
the ban was recently lifted			0
" i 've been getting in trouble my whole life and i really do n't care what anybody thinks of what i do on stage as a comic , " he said			0
" i know there are people out there who do n't even like this kind of comedy			0
turn off the tv , turn the channel			2
but i have millions of fans out there that have been waiting for this special and waiting for me to come back like this			2
" and @entity2 is back -- still with his edgy , expletive - filled humor and a cigarette as a constant prop			1
he chain - smokes through the front - porch conversation , but you wo n't hear the profanity			0
" i certainly do n't walk around my home or being with my family and just using profane language all the time , but on stage , it 's a constant , " he said			2
" because i 'm also hammering these different points across and because a lot of it is sexual , i just use the real words			0
" you will see his sons on stage , though			0
@entity35 , who also does stand - up , plays drums , while @entity36 is on guitar on singing			0
they are two - thirds of a rock group called " @entity174			0
" his ex-fiance -- comedian @entity175 -- is his opening act in the @entity15 special			1
with @entity175 sitting on a child - size plastic chair next to him , @entity2 calls her , " the greatest opening act i 've ever had -- as a woman			1
" as he enjoys her reaction to the backhanded compliment , he throws in , " she 's a killer			2
" despite their romantic history , @entity175 is a frequent visitor at his @entity0 home			0
she and his wife are " like best friends			0
" sister wives , he jokes			0
" when i got together with @entity189 ( his wife ) i told her there 's one woman in my life that , you know , i ca n't turn around and say ' i ca n't see you anymore , ' " he said			2
" @entity175 helped me bring up my boys , you know			0
it 's almost like she is an ex-wife , but one i get along with			2
" as for the smoking , @entity2 got some electronic cigarettes for @entity201			1
while he says he may rotate them into his personal routine , do n't expect to see them in his hand on stage when he 's reciting his infamous versions of @entity209 nursery rhymes			2
for that , it 's the same dice you 've seen for decades .			2
