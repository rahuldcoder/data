on paper , the race in @entity1 between sen. @entity2 and his @entity4 challenger , @entity3 , should be pretty clear - cut : the experienced veteran easily beats a political novice			1
but like most things , it 's not			2
@entity10 must cross the first hurdle by beating his primary challenger , @entity12 , before he engages in what is expected to be one of the most expensive and bitterly fought @entity17 campaigns this midterm season			1
a lot is at stake overall in november : control of the @entity17 and the political fate of one of the most powerful @entity24 in @entity25			0
@entity3 ' advantage @entity3 , 35 , was just 7 when @entity10 was first elected to the @entity17			1
@entity2 would face biggest challenge yet in @entity3 while he rose up the ranks in @entity25 and became @entity17 @entity24 leader , @entity3 practiced law and won statewide office as secretary of state in 2011			1
despite her short political career , like @entity10 , her name carries weight -- for better or worse			1
@entity3 ' family has a long history in state @entity4 politics			1
her father , @entity40 , was the former chairman of the @entity41 and a state legislator			0
but he was forced out of those roles over legal problems facing his catering company			0
while the family name has been battered , its connections survive : she 'll have access to the deep pockets and support of her father 's allies , including @entity56 and @entity57			2
the former president has already hit the trail for @entity3 , raising more than $ 600,000 at one @entity61 event in february			1
that was a significant chunk of cash for the one - time , part - time kickboxing instructor , helping to build her war chest for a race that some experts predict could reach $ 100 million in spending			2
@entity3 has already raised $ 8 million and she outraised @entity10 in two of the past three quarters			1
@entity71 is among her biggest donors			0
ousting the top @entity17 @entity24 has attracted national attention			0
remember when actress @entity74 was rumored to be considering a run ? @entity3 ' political career but @entity3 has built her own credentials in @entity1 politics , @entity79 , political science professor at the @entity81 in @entity82 , said			2
" she has n't made any major errors in her statewide office , " he said			0
" then again it 's also not an office where you can distinguish yourself either			0
" her relative inexperience , however , was an issue early on			0
she was heavily criticized and mocked after her @entity17 announcement last july			0
@entity10 's campaign team created a video that pointed out that she used her secretary of state campaign banner , had no signs and few supporters in attendance			1
she also looked like a deer in headlights			0
while her " official " campaign announcement took place 30 days later and ran much more smoothly , @entity79 said her campaign has so far been " passive			0
" 2014 midterms : what 's at stake even though she announced in july , she did n't release her first television ad until two weeks ago			0
@entity79 said her strategy to lay low saved campaign cash , letting @entity10 get beat up by his primary opponent			1
but critics say she missed an opportunity to define herself when the campaign noise was relatively quiet			0
" both she and the @entity10 campaign will have a tug - of - war over how she will be defined , " @entity79 said			2
@entity117 , senior adviser in @entity10 's campaign , did just that in an interview with @entity121			1
" she was recruited to run by ( @entity123 ) @entity124 to help @entity125 hold onto the @entity17 , and for most people in @entity1 , that 's a pretty easy choice , " he said			0
@entity3 ' campaign defends its strategy , saying the organization has spent its time and money setting up an extensive organization throughout @entity1 that will lead to voter outreach and @entity136 votes			1
on primary night , she is concluding a 10 - day , 50 - county bus tour , an aggressive attempt to introduce herself to voters across the state , effectively launching her campaign in earnest			0
the issues like democrats across the country , @entity3 is touting her support for an increase of the minimum wage , an issue that is intended to persuade working women to vote on @entity136			2
@entity125 take on the @entity153 brothers but politics are still local			0
@entity1 is the nation 's third - largest coal producer and who likes coal more is likely to be a major issue in the race			2
@entity3 says she is a major supporter of coal and her campaign said she opposes the @entity163 's carbon limits on power plants			1
that is a position opposite the one that president @entity168 and most @entity125 in the @entity17 take			0
the @entity10 campaign is charging hypocrisy as she receives funds from @entity125 who support the @entity163 's stricter standards			1
but @entity3 will paint @entity10 as a powerful elected official who stood by and watched coal jobs leave the state			1
with the general election now on the horizon , @entity3 is in a good place			2
@entity10 has low approval numbers and major polls show her about tied with the long - time senator			2
but as @entity79 points out , the number of people who do n't know who @entity3 is or have no opinion about her leaves a blank canvas for her to paint or @entity10 to exploit			1

@entity3 is taking on @entity190 leader @entity2
she 's raising money and has the backing of the @entity194
the race is expected to be one of the most expensive during this midterm season
@entity10 has a tough primary and @entity3 does not ; will that work against her , or for her ?
