-- as @entity5 president @entity4 decides on the best strategy to deal with the threat posed by @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 and beyond , his final plan of action will undoubtedly include the participation of like - minded allied countries and regional partners			1
one such partner are the @entity15 of northern @entity9 who regard @entity8 as the biggest threat since the fall of the @entity19 regime in 2003			1
the @entity15 , however , are hoping for a more robust and lasting @entity5 commitment as part of rekindled @entity15 - @entity5 cooperation			1
meanwhile , it might be timely for @entity24 to reassess its previous refusal to directly engage with @entity15 armed forces			0
as the last few weeks of military battles against @entity8 show , when @entity5 assistance has not been forthcoming , the @entity9 @entity15 have turned to @entity30 for help			1
in terms of identity , the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) in northern @entity9 stands apart from most of the rest of the @entity36 due to its secular way of life and @entity40 orientation			1
and what the @entity15 have put together here since securing autonomy from @entity44 in 2005 is antithetical to the primordial worldview of @entity8 , which calls itself the @entity46			1
now , with its record of relative stability and nascent democracy in danger , officials in the @entity32 are once again turning to the @entity5			2
the @entity15 have welcomed @entity24 's decision to confront @entity8			2
at the same time , however , officials in @entity55 are urging the @entity4 administration to start a long overdue process of helping the @entity15 help themselves by empowering them militarily			2
the simplest of facts about the @entity15 armed forces -- the @entity60 -- are hard to miss. despite the heightened enthusiasm to repel @entity8 , the @entity60 continue to suffer from some elemental structural drawbacks			2
after years of semi-autonomous rule , @entity9 @entity15 still lack an institutionalized , non-politicized armed force			1
the majority of the @entity60 are still made up from armed members from the two largest political parties in the @entity32 : the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) and the @entity69 ( @entity69 )			0
in the past the absence of an organized and well - trained armed force was accepted by the various @entity9 @entity15 parties as an inevitable but tolerable condition			1
the rise of @entity8 , however , has rapidly changed that unsustainable attitude			0
the role of the @entity5 to achieve a better organized and a more capable @entity15 military force requires more than just political horse - trading in @entity55			2
it requires @entity5 mediation and military assistance to the @entity15			2
the fact that the @entity5 has good relations with all @entity9 @entity15 parties gives @entity24 leverage among the @entity15 parties			1
this leverage can be used to set out to help the @entity9 @entity15 build up a more efficient military as they battle @entity8			1
but , before any practical steps can be taken , @entity24 first has to decide whether it wants to go down this path			0
since the fall of @entity19 's regime , the @entity5 has chosen not to train and equip the @entity15 @entity60 directly			2
@entity24 's policy on the provision of military assistance and training has been that all such efforts will have to go through the central government in @entity44			0
the @entity5 is still committed to @entity9 's territorial integrity as a principal policy and dealing with the @entity15 over the head of @entity44 is seen as putting that policy in danger			1
and then there are the bureaucratic hurdles to overcome			0
despite good relations with the leaderships of the @entity68 and the @entity69 , on paper both entities are still designated by the @entity5 as @entity111 terrorist organizations			0
that is why the @entity60 , numbering 150,000 of which some 110,000 are members of @entity68 or the @entity69 , can not receive @entity5 military aid directly			0
as @entity5 policy - makers wrestle with this question in @entity24 , @entity9 's @entity15 have had to look elsewhere for support			1
in june , following the barrage of military victories of @entity8 , @entity30 was at first the only country that proved willing to come to the aid of the @entity15 with military supplies and advisors			2
in a press conference with the @entity30 foreign minister , @entity125 , in @entity55 on august 26 , @entity126 , president of @entity127 , said " @entity127 will never forget @entity30 's support that came at a crucial time beyond our expectation			0
" but @entity30 's appearance as the key backer of the @entity60 is not cost - free			0
under @entity137 's stewardship , @entity30 - backed @entity135 militias from elsewhere in @entity9 have come north to join the fight against @entity8			0
as much as the @entity15 have welcomed @entity30 's role in rolling back @entity8 , there are fears about the longer - term impact of @entity137 's larger footprint in @entity127			0
but given the imminent threat posed by @entity8 , how @entity30 military support has come about is for now a secondary concern for @entity9 's @entity15			1
they are simply pleased that @entity137 has been there to provide much -- needed military aid when it was most wanted			0
@entity137 , meantime , will not be blind to the fact that internal @entity15 divisions and a decentralized @entity60 force provides it with opportunities to intervene and increase its influence in northern @entity9			0
as president @entity4 formulates a long - term strategy to neutralize the threat of @entity8 , he can not ignore the pivotal role @entity15 fighters likely will play in such a campaign			1
it might also be an opportune moment to revisit some of the more archaic @entity5 policies that shape ties with @entity9 @entity127			0
as @entity24 looks for ways to better organize and militarily equip the @entity60 against @entity8 , the one undeniable fact is that the @entity9 @entity15 are hoping for swift @entity5 action			1
they prefer the @entity5 over other foreign partners but are hardly in a position to be overly selective given the imminent threat from @entity8			1
