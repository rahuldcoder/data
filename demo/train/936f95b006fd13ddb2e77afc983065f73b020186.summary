@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is conducting a long - awaited procedure to permanently seal its crippled well in the @entity5			1
it 's proceeding with a complex operation known as a " static kill , " pumping heavy drilling mud down from above to push oil back into the well reservoir			1
the effort could take " something in the range of a bunch of hours to a couple of days , " @entity12 vice president @entity11 said tuesday afternoon in a telephone conference			1
" we 're extremely focused at this point in making sure we execute the static kill as best we can			1
" the operation started about 4 p.m. et. @entity3 may pause the procedure from time to time to measure pressure and evaluate how it 's working , @entity11 said			1
it 's still unclear whether the mud will be followed by cement , according to @entity11			1
engineers will evaluate that as they proceed			2
they may decide to wait until a relief well is completed in an accompanying well - killing effort known as a " bottom kill " -- intended to serve as an insurance policy that the well is sealed			2
that could happen about a week from now			2
the static kill is the biggest development in the long - running saga involving @entity3 's well since a tightly fitting cap was placed on it in @entity41 , stopping oil from flowing into the @entity5 for the first time in almost three months			1
it represents the beginning of the end of the worst environmental disaster in @entity49 history			0
some reporters were allowed on the @entity51 , the ship that is pumping the mud , as the static kill got under way			1
the operation took place under blue skies in clear blue seas -- in sharp contrast to scenes in the @entity5 weeks ago , when oil covered vast swaths of water			2
" all i can say is that everything looks good			0
everything is going the way we want it to , " said @entity66 , a @entity3 representative on the ship			1
in previous operations , when @entity3 was testing the " integrity " of the well , it wanted to see rising pressure readings , indicating the capped well was holding up			1
but in the static kill , declining pressure is a good sign , indicating the mud is proceeding down the well without seepage			1
that was indeed the case tuesday , according to @entity83			0
he said pressure was dropping steadily			0
in late afternoon , it had dropped from more than 6,900 pounds per square inch to about 4,500 pounds per square inch			0
the ship 's captain , @entity88 , said it also was important to keep the ship very stable during the static kill , and the vessel was being kept within a meter of its position			1
@entity3 proceeded with the static kill after conducting a crucial test to determine if oil in the capped well could actually be pushed back down into the reservoir and it was safe to proceed			1
in the " injectivity " test , a surface ship slowly injected small amounts of mud into the well at several different rates to make sure the mud would reach the reservoir			1
senior vice president @entity11 said the test was " textbook			1
it went exactly as we would have expected			0
" @entity3 said that all the operations are being carried out with the approval of the federal official overseeing the response to the oil spill , retired adm. @entity118			1
the injectivity test had been delayed because of a small hydraulic leak discovered in the capping stack hydraulic control system			1
but @entity3 and @entity118 said earlier tuesday the leak had been fixed by crews overnight			1
" the leak involved two valves that are on the kill side of the capping stack and they started to lose pressure			2
we found that out in time and locked the valve shut			0
and , had the valves failed for any particular reason , that might have caused hydrocarbons to go into the environment and that 's not good , " @entity118 said			0
@entity118 emphasized that relief wells being drilled are the " answer " to plugging the ruptured well			0
" i think all of our hopes and aspirations are that this thing will come to an end , " @entity118 said , discussing the entire spill ordeal			0
" it 's been an agonizing period for the people of the @entity5 and the @entity49 in general			0
" meanwhile , scientists charged with determining the flow from the leaking well said monday that roughly 4.9 million barrels ( 205.8 million gallons ) of oil have seeped from it			0
about 800,000 barrels of that were retrieved by siphoning vessels on the surface over the leak			0
previously , the same group had put the total estimate of oil leaked from the well before it being capped on july 15 at between 3 million and 5.2 million barrels			2
according to @entity2 data , this makes it the worst - ever accidental oil spill in marine waters			0
it all started when the @entity169 rig exploded april 20 , killing 11 workers and launching the relentless oil spill			0
that prompted a wide - ranging response that involved dispersants , burning oil on the surface of the water and gathering it with skimming ships , trying to prevent it from reaching shore with booms and collecting oil debris from beaches across the @entity5 with an army of @entity3 workers			1
the @entity3 spill surpassed the 1979 @entity188 blowout in the @entity189 off the coast of @entity191 , which resulted in 140 million gallons of oil being spilled			2
the worst oil spill of all time was intentional			0
during the @entity196 , the @entity195 purposely released 240 million gallons of oil into the @entity198			0
when the @entity3 well was capped in the @entity5 in july , scientists said some 53,000 barrels of oil per day were leaking from it , while roughly 62,000 barrels of oil were likely gushing from it each day at the beginning of the incident			1
" we knew from the start it was a catastrophic spill , " @entity118 said			0
meanwhile , @entity3 said wednesday it has started " a series of actions to expedite claim payments to businesses " affected by the spill			2
" we heard from many business people who are suffering , so we acted			0
these changes are designed to cut through paperwork and expedite payments , " said @entity216 of the @entity3 claims team			2
the company said about 2,600 business claims were processed over the past three days with new guidelines			2
" as a result , business claims totaling $ 9 million were approved saturday , sunday and monday			0
these payments will be mailed to businesses this week , " @entity3 said in a press release			2
@entity2 's @entity229 contributed to this report .			0
