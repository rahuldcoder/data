@entity0 -- the @entity3 administration says that @entity4 was not involved or given advance warning about the operation that killed @entity7 , but top @entity9 officials said the @entity11 leader never would have been found and killed without the counterterrorism cooperation between the two countries over the past few years			1
" @entity4 has contributed greatly to our efforts to dismantle @entity11			2
and in fact , cooperation with @entity4 helped lead @entity9 to @entity7 and the compound in which he was hiding , " secretary of state @entity16 said			1
" we 're committed to this partnership			0
we think it is in the best interest of the security and safety of the @entity9			0
" officials maintain that the relationship with @entity28 is complicated , fraught with difficulties and mistrust , but the fact that @entity4 has allowed the @entity9 counterterrorism operative to operate on its soil , albeit with only a tacit endorsement , is critical to the type of operations that led to finding @entity7			1
" the relationship is complicated and their cooperation is mixed at best and going forward it 's going to be bumpy , but there is no way to do this sort of thing without this partnership , " one senior official said			0
" the idea that this would have happened if they would n't have let our guys in the country is not possible			0
" officials said they do believe that while a few members of the @entity4 intelligence service @entity51 might have known about @entity7 's location , they do n't think it was broadly known that he was there			1
but they acknowledge that @entity4 does have some explaining to do about how @entity7 was hiding in plain sight just miles from the country 's main military academy for close to a year			1
the @entity9 never told @entity4 about its suspicions that @entity7 was hiding out at the compound , officials said			1
" @entity4 has never been and never will be the hotbed of fanaticism that is often described by the media , " @entity4 president @entity61 wrote in a @entity63 column monday			0
" and for me , justice against @entity7 was not just political ; it was also personal , as the terrorists murdered our greatest leader , the mother of my children			0
" some in the @entity9 press have suggested that @entity4 lacked vitality in its pursuit of terrorism , or worse yet that we were disingenuous and actually protected the terrorists we claimed to be pursuing			1
such baseless speculation may make exciting cable news , but it does n't reflect fact			0
" @entity80 , @entity4 's ambassador to the @entity9 , insisted his government had no knowledge of @entity7 's whereabouts at any point over the last several years			1
he did n't rule out the possibility that some in @entity4 who were sympathetic to @entity7 's views provided him sanctuary			1
" @entity4 is a nation of 180 million			0
there are people in @entity4 , unfortunately , who have sympathies with @entity7 and obviously some of them had protected for him while he was there , " he said			1
" if we had really known where @entity7 was , we would have got him			0
" despite being left in the dark , the @entity4 envoy spoke positively about the @entity7 mission			1
" they had superior intelligence , they had superior technology , and we are grateful to them and to @entity101 for having given us this opportunity to bring this chapter to an end , " @entity80 told @entity1			0
in addition to president @entity3 's phone call with @entity4 president @entity61 , administration officials will continue to engage the government " as we learn more about the compound and whatever type of support system @entity7 had , " @entity106 counterterrorism advisor @entity105 told reporters monday			1
the hope , officials said , is that the attack will inspire the @entity4 government to cooperate more fully with the @entity9			1
several officials predict @entity4 will go through a period of soul - searching about the fact @entity7 was hiding in their country in plain sight as well as the fact the @entity9 killed him on their soil			1
" the top four @entity11 leaders were killed or captured in @entity4 ; it 's ridiculous to say this is not their problem , " a second @entity9 official said			2
" and any claims that we violated their sovereignty wo n't resonate because the target on the other end was @entity7			2
" @entity137 of the @entity138 said @entity4 's initial reaction to the news suggested reason for cautious optimism about the relationship going forward			0
" they did n't attack us for entering @entity4			2
they did n't condemn us for being in @entity4			2
those are positive signs , " he said			0
but he added , " they do n't tell us , however , what 's happening in the @entity4 military or @entity51 or the people who in the past have supported the @entity153 or tolerated @entity11			2
" officials said the @entity9 is going to be treating @entity4 gingerly over the next few days as they weigh how the attack will affect the relationship			2
@entity157 , special representative for @entity158 / @entity4 , is in @entity28 on monday for talks with @entity4 officials			0
" we still need @entity4 's cooperation , and we need to see how we can move forward , " the second official said			2
" we need to give them some credit for what they have done , which did lead to this day			0
we ca n't focus excessively on the negative			0
" @entity105 pointed out that despite the " differences of view " between the @entity9 and @entity4 on counterterrorism cooperation , @entity4 has been responsible for killing and capturing more terrorists on its soil than any other country " by a wide margin			1
" " there have been many , many brave @entity4 soldiers , security officials , as well as citizens , who have given their lives because of the terrorism scourge in that country , " @entity105 said , calling the partnership with @entity4 " critically important to breaking the back of @entity11 and eventually prevailing over @entity11 as well as associated terrorist groups			0
" but @entity186 of the @entity187 warns that @entity7 's death does not resolve the big - ticket issues between @entity0 and @entity28 , namely @entity4 's support for the @entity153 and other insurgent groups battling @entity9 forces in @entity158 , such as the @entity193			1
" as long as many of those issues continue to exist , and they have very different interests , and they have very different strategic goals in the area , then some level of conflict will likely persist , " @entity186 said			0
officials said they hope the @entity9 can get @entity4 on board to support a political process in @entity158 with reconciliation between the @entity153 and the @entity158 government -- and they believe @entity7 's death presents an opportunity for progress			1
officials do believe that @entity11 in @entity4 has suffered a huge disruption , having lost a charasmatic leader such as @entity7			2
but they also are bracing for members of @entity11 to avenge his death and believe the @entity9 will see a period of increased threat , where attacks will likely be planned against @entity9 interests .			0

some in @entity9 hope for more cooperation with @entity4
@entity4 given credit for allowing operation on its soil
others *skeptical* @entity4 did n't know @entity7 was near military academy
