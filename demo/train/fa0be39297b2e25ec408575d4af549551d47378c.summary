-- when i saw the story , my jaw dropped			0
has journalism deteriorated so badly that @entity6 's campaign aides are allowed to send quotes to reporters that " come back redacted , stripped of colorful metaphors , colloquial language and anything even mildly provocative , " as the @entity12 reported			1
it 's called " quote approval , " and it 's quite a problem			1
it 's also , as the @entity12 noted , not a practice limited to @entity18			1
" @entity21 approval is standard practice for the @entity6 campaign , used by many top strategists and almost all midlevel aides in @entity26 and at the @entity27 , " the story reported			1
" it is also commonplace throughout @entity29 and on the campaign trail			0
" some @entity32 staffers are afforded the same privilege , the @entity12 said			0
@entity34 : @entity21 approval a media sellout ten years ago when i was @entity27 press secretary , before @entity38 and @entity39 , in an era when reporters used to pick up their phones to conduct interviews as opposed to e-mailing , i would have been laughed out of the briefing room if i tried to get quote approval for something i said			1
occasionally , i talked on background as a senior administration official , but no reporter would ever let me pick and choose which on - the - record quotes they could use nor would anyone let me edit or clean up a quote			1
my how things have changed -- and the change began , it 's important to note -- toward the end of the second term of @entity61			0
@entity62 , another reporter at the @entity12 who has covered the last three @entity64 , told me in an ( on - the - record ) interview that quote approval evolved from something beneficial to a " pernicious practice to be avoided			1
" like @entity71 , it began with good intent			0
reporters covering @entity61 's second term , under pressure from editors not to use unnamed sources in their stories , started asking their sources if a background quote , attributed to a senior aide , could instead be turned into an on - the - record quote , with the aide 's name in print			1
i e-mailed last week with several former @entity61 staffers and many confirmed they engaged in that practice			2
for a very limited number of the most senior aides , that made sense			0
let 's say a reporter is talking to a knowledgeable aide at the @entity96 who wo n't speak for attribution , because their job is not to talk to the press			2
their boss wo n't like it if they do , or their phone will ring off the hook with 20 other reporters who want to turn the aide into a press secretary			1
but the aide will talk to an occasional reporter because their conversation , often about complicated policy matters , may inform the reporter and lead to a more accurate , more nuanced story			0
but since the reporter ca n't quote the official by name , and editors do n't want to use unnamed sources , what 's a reporter to do ? so reporters began pushing back , persuading staffers to let one sentence be quoted by name			2
the sentence was e-mailed to the aide , and when permission was granted to use it , quote approval among the most senior aides got started			2
sunday 's media monitor but pushback has now turned into quote approval for almost everyone , even when the story is n't nuanced or complicated , and that 's where the problem begins			2
reporters are easily acquiescing today to midlevel aides who seek quote approval			1
these aides are n't talking to make certain a story is more nuanced or better informed			0
they 're doing it because they want more control of the story or to clean up a sloppy quote -- and because reporters let them			2
@entity62 called it an " effort to get more transparency but it 's backfired			0
the town has found a convenient way to control the press , " he said , referring to people throughout @entity29 and on the campaign trail			2
as a former press secretary , i 'm all for trying to control the press , but quote approval goes too far			1
@entity162 , the editor - in - chief of the @entity163 , reportedly sent an e-mail to reporters who work for him declaring quote approval off limits			1
" our policy and common sense dictate that we do n't allow public officials to edit @entity172 coverage , " he wrote			2
the problem with quote approval is it 's too easy			0
it turns the relationship between a source and a reporter entirely over to the source			0
and the practice has spread too far and wide			0
too many staffers will speak only if their quotes are approved and too many reporters are happy to oblige			1
the relationship between a source and the press will always resemble a tug - of - war			1
since the early days of our republic , government officials and the media have clashed			0
it 's part of the ongoing , generally healthy dynamic in our noisy democracy			0
over time , the ground shifts and one party gains the upper hand , only to lose it back			0
of course , the media 's focus on the trivial -- see coverage of @entity32 's trip to @entity203 -- makes sources fight even more for control , lest a sentence be misconstrued , exaggerated and hyperfocused			0
but so long as reporters allow their sources quote approval , this round has been won by the sources			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .			1

former @entity27 press secretary says *balance* of power *dominated* by officials
he says making reporters *submit* quotes in advance for approval goes too far
@entity214 says practice *emerged* out of ongoing tug - of - war inside the @entity228
