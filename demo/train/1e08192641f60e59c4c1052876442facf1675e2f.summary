-- over the past year , @entity1 has come full circle in the court of public opinion			1
around this time last year , most people thought of her as the shrewish mother of eight who was constantly nagging and snapping at her laid - back husband , @entity8			2
as soon as they divorced last summer and @entity8 started dating a string of questionable 20 - somethings , @entity1 became the sane and stable one to @entity8 's man - boy			1
then , @entity1 appeared on " @entity13 , " and again she became the shrew , as rumors flew that she was nasty to her fellow cast members behind the scenes			1
well , i 'm going to say something controversial			2
i think she 's smart and appreciate her wry , barely - there sense of humor			2
i think she 's handled herself with restraint and class for the past year while dealing with the end of her marriage under the tabloid microscope			0
i appreciate how open she is about her emotions , and how hard it is to move on			0
and while millions will be watching when " @entity30 " premieres on sunday , i 'm looking forward to having a second dose of @entity1 on television with her brand - new reality show , " @entity35 , " coming to @entity34 soon			1
here are 10 reasons i 'll be watching			2
@entity1 has the best name ever			1
not that i 'm biased			0
the @entity0 : @entity1 and 7 others rejected by @entity39 2			1
the concept of the show is a touch schmaltzy , but interesting			0
@entity1 takes a letter from a fan struggling through some challenge and visits them to essentially live their lives , meeting their family and doing their job			1
" she will be in that person 's shoes			0
and more often than not , it 's not going to be terribly comfortable for her , " @entity34 chief @entity55 told @entity56			0
@entity1 wrote in a blog post today , " i look forward to being dropped into the lives of interesting and unique people and families			1
... @entity1 on the back of a trash truck , anyone ? " is she really going to be a garbage collector for an episode ? need			1
the @entity0 : stars who ended relationships to chase fame 4			0
ok , fine , i want to see what her hair will look like			0
will she keep the extensions or go back to her signature porcupine reverse - mullet ? 5			2
we also know that in one episode , according to local @entity81 press , she will be a waitress at @entity83			1
she was spotted filming in @entity84 , @entity81 , in december			1
will she be able to deal with rude diners without sending them to time - out ? 6			2
it 'll be nice to see @entity1 get a break from caring for eight kids			1
perhaps we 'll get to see her real personality rather than the on - edge @entity93 mom ? 7			1
perhaps during one of the 12 episodes airing this summer , @entity1 will meet a guy			1
how nice it would be to see her out on a date			0
the @entity0 : @entity100 's girlfriend says @entity101 looks like haggard rocker 8			0
that said , we 're thankful she 's not the next " @entity106			0
" we 're glad she decided to go this route instead of straight to a dating show			0
the @entity0 : " @entity113 " dream team - @entity111 , @entity114 , and " @entity115 " are on our list 9			2
it 'll be fun to guess which life she test - drives next			1
here 's hoping that she gets to be a circus performer			0
or maybe she could put her " @entity13 " skills to use , and visit a struggling exotic dancer ? 10			0
hey , it 's better than a show about her ex @entity128			0
the @entity0 : @entity130 to spill her love secrets on her new tv show @entity133 all rights reserved			0

according to local @entity81 press , she will be a waitress at one point
