-- nearly 800 classified @entity2 military documents obtained by @entity3 reveal extraordinary details about the alleged terrorist activities of @entity7 operatives captured and housed at the @entity9 's detention facility in @entity10 , @entity11			1
the secret documents have been made available to several news organizations , including the @entity14 and the @entity15 -- and some have been published by @entity3 , an organization that facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information			2
@entity0 was not among the news organizations granted early access to the latest files			0
the documents shed light on the way detainees behaved while at @entity10 and on how they were assessed in terms of their danger to the @entity2			1
they are intelligence assessments of nearly every one of the 779 individuals who have been held at @entity10 since 2002 , according to the @entity15			0
the @entity30 said in a statement that the documents underscore a need for an independent judicial review of the cases of those being held at @entity10			1
" these documents are remarkable because they show just how questionable the government 's basis has been for detaining hundreds of people , in some cases indefinitely , at @entity10 , " said @entity37 , director of the @entity30 's @entity38 , in the statement			1
" the one - sided assessments are rife with uncorroborated evidence , information obtained through torture , speculation , errors and allegations that have been proven false			0
" these documents are the fruit of the original sin by which the rule of law was scrapped when @entity10 detainees were first rounded up , " @entity52 said			1
" if the government had followed the law , it would have established a meaningful and prompt process to separate the innocent from those who are legally detainable			0
" the classified files described some of the detainees as being compliant while others threatened violence against guards			2
one stated he would fly planes into houses			0
they also paint in great detail a portrait of @entity7 as it grew stronger in @entity75 in the 1990s , prepared for the september 11 attacks and scattered in their aftermath			1
among the files already published by @entity3 and examined by @entity0 is that of @entity81 , recently convicted by a @entity83 court of taking part in the bombing of the @entity86 in @entity87 in 1998			0
the file , from 2006 when @entity81 was transferred to @entity10 , includes details of his time as a bodyguard and cook to @entity92 shortly before the 9/11 attacks			1
@entity81 is cited as telling interrogators that the @entity7 leader had a " normal diet " and usually ate with about 15 bodyguards			1
the document says @entity81 later became one of @entity7 's few forgers of travel documents			1
he also opted for training in using explosives to avoid front - line combat			0
a document from july 2008 profiles another bodyguard for @entity92 , @entity107 , who stated that he " would have been willing to die for @entity92 " ( the shorthand used for the @entity7 leader )			1
it says @entity107 may have had knowledge of @entity7 's nuclear and chemical programs			1
@entity113 escaped from @entity75 after the fall of the @entity115 in 2001 and returned to @entity116 , where he continued to train for terrorist attacks , according to the document			2
he was arrested in 2002 after being lured to @entity119 while planning an attack on @entity121 in the @entity122			0
it adds that while at @entity10 , @entity107 made " numerous threats against @entity2 personnel including the president			0
" @entity113 reportedly said " he would like to tell his friends in @entity128 to find the interrogator , slice him up , and make a shwarma ( a type of sandwich ) out of him , with the interrogator 's head sticking out of the end of the shwarma			2
" another @entity116 , @entity137 , is described as a " senior @entity7 facilitator " with links to the 9/11 plotters			1
he was allegedly responsible for arranging the travel of @entity116 jihadists to @entity75 in the 1990s , and when he also moved to @entity75 , he became a confidant of @entity92 's			1
the 11 - page document about his activities says that " on occasion detainee hiked mountain trails with @entity92 , who hiked them on a daily basis			1
" @entity137 told his interrogators that @entity92 had been in good health , even though he had one kidney			1
the document suggests that @entity7 had plenty of money in the aftermath of september 11 , asserting that " detainee received and passed on over $ 500,000 " while helping jihadists to escape @entity75			1
according to the @entity15 , the documents provide detailed insight into @entity92 's thinking and movements immediately after 9/11			1
" among other previously unknown meetings , the documents describe a major gathering of some of @entity7 's most senior operatives in early december 2001 in @entity171 , a mountainous region of @entity75 between @entity172 and @entity173 , " the newspaper reports			1
" there , the operatives began to plan new attacks , a process that would consume them , according to the assessments , until they were finally captured			2
" the documents show that detainees ' accounts were extensively cross-checked against each other , with at least four detainees confirming that @entity107 was a bodyguard to @entity92			1
among the more remarkable statements is one from a detainee who claimed that @entity92 had written to @entity116 's president , @entity188 , before the september 11 attacks , requesting the release of @entity107 ( who 'd been detained in 1995 ) and another man from jail			1
a short time later , they were freed and went to @entity75			0
the documents include substantial detail about the travel of the detainees			1
in one instance , a @entity201 jihadist by the name of @entity203 , after spending time in @entity198 and @entity199 , is instructed to travel to @entity75 via @entity205			0
the document notes : " travel through @entity205 is a known modus operandi for @entity7 operatives to get into @entity75 via a chain of safe - houses and operatives			1
" according to the @entity14 , the documents show that most of the 172 prisoners still held at @entity10 have been rated as a " high risk " of posing a threat to the @entity2 and its allies if released without adequate rehabilitation			2
but they also show that many others who have been released or transferred to other countries were also designated " high risk , " the newspaper says			0
detainees are assessed " high , " " medium " or " low " in terms of their intelligence value , the threat they pose while in detention and the continued threat they might pose to the @entity2 if released			2
the newspaper says the documents include details about detainees ' illnesses and behavior at @entity10 , including " punching guards , tearing apart shower shoes , shouting across cell blocks			2
" but the documents appear to shed little light on interrogation tactics at @entity10 , which have drawn widespread criticism			0
the @entity14 says the documents lay bare " the patchwork and contradictory evidence that in many cases would never have stood up in criminal court or a military tribunal			2
" the @entity198 newspaper , the @entity251 , also reports that the documents suggest that much of the evidence used to detain jihadist suspects was flimsy			0
it says that " people wearing a certain model of @entity259 watch from the 1980s were seized by @entity2 forces in @entity75 on suspicion of being terrorists , because the watches were used as timers by @entity7			2
" most were subsequently release for lack of evidence			0
others , according to the @entity14 , were not so fortunate despite a lack of evidence			0
one man detained in may 2003 insisted that he was a shepherd and , according to his debriefers at @entity10 , knew nothing of " simple military and political concepts			0
" yet a military tribunal declared him an " enemy combatant " anyway , and he was not sent home until 2006 , the @entity14 reports			0
" it 's not too late to change course and we need more legal process , not less , to make sure we 're holding the right people , " @entity52 said			0
" the cases of the remaining @entity10 detainees cry out for independent judicial review			1
" the @entity287 condemned the release of the documents , known as @entity290			0
@entity292 press secretary @entity291 and ambassador @entity293 , the @entity295 administration 's special envoy on detainee issues , said in a statement : " the @entity298 , established in january 2009 , considered the @entity299 during its review of detainee information			2
in some cases , the @entity298 came to the same conclusions as the @entity304			0
in other instances the @entity305 came to different conclusions , based on updated or other available information			0
" @entity3 gained international prominence after leaking thousands of papers about the @entity2 - led war in @entity75			0
earlier this year it released a huge cache of secret @entity2 diplomatic papers .			0
