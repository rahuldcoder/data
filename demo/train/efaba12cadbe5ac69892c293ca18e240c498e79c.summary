-- the @entity1 is understandably nervous about the election of @entity3			0
the president - elect of @entity5 is taking charge of a febrile situation			1
the economy is contracting and human rights abuses are rampant -- attacks on @entity12 churches by @entity14 groups have forced an estimated 100,000 @entity15 to flee the country			1
@entity3 's @entity17 is philosophically committed to creating a state governed by @entity14 law , and some say that his victory poses a threat to @entity23			1
now he wants to reach out to @entity24			0
but it would be wrong to conclude that @entity14 democracy is a contradiction in terms			1
whatever new state emerges in @entity5 almost certainly wo n't be democratic in the liberal , @entity31 tradition , and there will be a constant fight to protect the rights of women and religious minorities			1
but the presumption that @entity3 's political @entity14 is the vanguard of theocratic dictatorship ignores historical and contemporary evidence to the contrary			1
@entity14 is simply too complex to be stereotyped as the faith of tyrants			1
early @entity17 societies , romanticized by @entity14 , were decentralized in nature and allowed for a large degree of self - government			1
the first caliphs were elected by tribal councils , and their powers were limited by legal scholars in a manner that approximates to constitutionalism			0
rulers could , theoretically , be impeached ; religious pluralism was tolerated			0
when @entity57 conquered @entity58 in 637 , he permitted @entity15 and @entity59 to remain in the holy city and worship freely in their own temples			0
the @entity62 is one of history 's first examples of a state guaranteeing religious freedom			0
the record of modern experiments in @entity14 statecraft is tragically mixed			1
on the good side , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and now @entity5 are all some form of democracy			1
even @entity24 has permitted a degree of popular representation			0
when the liberal - minded cleric @entity82 ran for the @entity24 presidency in 1997 , he was hindered by a media blackout and opposition from @entity24 's clerical leadership			0
yet he won 70 % on an 80 % turnout and was permitted to serve two terms			0
( admittedly , @entity82 's achievements in advancing civil liberties were few , and he was hampered by clerical intervention in parliamentary elections			0
) alas , there are many more examples across the @entity17 world of dictatorships and parties implacably committed to violent fundamentalism			2
@entity100 , for example , has n't stopped the bankrolling of terrorism , forces its subjects to live by a strict reading of @entity106 law and even tolerates beheadings for witchcraft			0
but while the @entity14 emphasis upon submission to religious authority might have hardened resistance to @entity116 values of pluralism and civil liberties , the legacy of western imperialism shares responsibility , too			2
@entity120 countries such as @entity121 and @entity122 are former @entity124 republics , @entity24 had its parliamentary democracy subverted by the @entity1 in the 1950s , and @entity100 politics have been dominated by the international oil market			0
in short , the spread of democracy in the @entity14 world has either been retarded by autocratic practices imported from the @entity1 , or subverted by @entity133 politics and economic globalization			2
pitted against these savage forces , @entity14 has sometimes offered a rare vehicle for anti-authoritarian dissent -- from @entity138 to @entity139			2
the fact that @entity14 parties , such as the @entity17 , have emerged from dictatorships bolstered by foreign arms has colored their politics -- to the degree that they regard @entity150 " democracy " as a byword for imperialism			1
nonetheless , there is some evidence that the @entity17 is a diverse , pragmatic movement more concerned with reducing the influence of the secular state than erecting a theocracy in its place			1
the @entity17 has certainly moderated its views in recent years to accommodate shifting domestic attitudes toward the veil , the presence of @entity150 or alcohol			2
an example of a more temperate @entity164 might be found in @entity165 , where the appointment of an @entity164 prime minister , @entity167 , has shown signs of opening the country up			2
he has promised transparency , a war on corruption and a fairer distribution of wealth			0
crucially , anything more radical that the prime minister might try to do is tempered by @entity165 's monarch and powerful army			1
this arrangement sees @entity164 expanding popular representation while the political establishment safeguards secularism			0
we see some of that careful balance in the new @entity5			1
the military still enjoys enormous power , and it will effectively control the writing of a constitution			0
the army might be motivated by venial desires to protect its power and patronage , but the fact that @entity3 is ultimately answerable to field marshal @entity193 , chairman of the @entity195 and defense minister , means his ability to construct any kind of theocracy is severely limited			0
although @entity150 unease toward @entity3 's @entity164 politics is justified by recent experience , the existence of historical and political variation offers hope that @entity5 wo n't become a new caliphate			1
on the contrary : in democracies , process is all -- and so far the process has been respected by everyone involved			0
the @entity1 's complaint that " the wrong man won " in @entity5 must n't detract from the fact that the country is still undergoing a remarkable , apparently progressive transition -- albeit at the cost of many lives			1
the people overthrew a dictator and then elected a new leader in free and fair elections			0
the very fact that the " wrong man " was even allowed to assume the presidency suggests that @entity5 is embracing a more humane politics			2
so far , political @entity14 has facilitated , not hindered , the building of a democratic country			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity228 .			2

@entity228 : many worry that @entity5 's @entity17 leader will bring theocracy
but @entity228 says historic and modern evidence shows @entity14 societies can be democratic
he says @entity73 , @entity71 and @entity165 seek balance between @entity14 and openness
@entity228 : @entity17 ( and military ) in @entity5 respecting democratic process so far
