@entity0 , @entity1 -- a grassroots activist , a head of state and a symbol of the @entity6			0
three women -- two who struggled in an @entity10 nation plagued by bloody civil war and a third who stood up to absolute dictatorship -- were bestowed with the @entity14 saturday			2
that the three of them shared the coveted prize was unusual			1
that all three are women was unprecedented			1
as was the conversation that followed with @entity2			0
punctured with the gravity of the unspeakable cruelty women have endured in @entity23 and @entity24 and with the humor that can come only from women who have led the battle to end it , the conversation reflected the indomitable spirit for which the @entity30 was awarded			1
" beyond fighting for our individual countries , we are fighting for the emancipation of women and girls , " said @entity31			1
this was no token prize			2
" we worked very , very hard for this			0
it 's been a long time coming , " @entity31 said			1
women 's rights take center stage at ceremony this was no prize given out of sympathy , either , added @entity47 , the first @entity48 woman to win the honor			1
" we deserve it , " she said to thundering applause in the same room where hours before she accepted her medal and diploma			0
" it 's recognition that women can do a lot			1
" and @entity60 , @entity61 's first female head of state , said it was still harder for women to achieve what men can			1
" let 's face it , in a way , women are stronger than men , " she said to laughter			1
the women have much in common , they agreed			2
but each has their own tale set against a backdrop of injustice and violence			0
for most of the 1990s , @entity23 meant bloodshed , a maelstrom of violence that bled across its borders and where , child soldiers became killers and warlords became presidents			1
@entity87 bludgeoned his way into power in 1997 and many , sadly , predicted perpetual conflict in the @entity10 nation			0
no one figured that it would be @entity23 's women who would be the ones to stand up to @entity87			1
@entity31 , a trauma counselor , led them by the thousands			1
they dressed in stark white t - shirts and demanded an end to the violence against them			0
" when you find yourself at a place where there seems to be no hope , you find yourself at a place you are destitute , you find yourself at a place where you are angry -- you have two options , " @entity31 said			1
you either pick up a gun or you try to do something different , she said			0
the women threatened curses on @entity23 's men , organized sex strikes and sit - ins to shame them			1
@entity31 even threatened to shed her clothes as a gesture to show how her dignity had been stripped			1
" it was the women in white looking @entity87 in the eye , " she said			2
@entity31 supposes that many others are deserving of a @entity14 for their roles in securing peace in @entity23			1
but they were mostly people in positions of authority ; people who had the power to implement change , she said			0
but the women she led were ordinary citizens who had nothing in hand			2
" the story of the @entity23 women is a typical @entity140 story , " she said			1
the women braved death to pray for peace			1
their movement found a powerful ally in @entity60 , a former finance minister and champion for women 's rights who also wanted to an end to the war and its perpetrators punished			1
when she became president , her challenge was daunting : to bring @entity23 back from the abyss			1
but she brought with her something new for her people : @entity156 , where there had only been despair			0
days before the @entity30 presentation , @entity60 was re-elected to office after a runoff vote			1
she will serve another six - year term			0
would she consider herself a success if after her six years , there is peace in @entity23 even if little else has been accomplished ? " definitely			1
i am already a success , " she said of the economic strides @entity23 has taken			1
but there will be more than peace , she hopes			2
there will be lights where streets were dark , running water where there were only buckets			0
education , health and all the things that make a nation great			0
" we will make @entity23 a post-conflict success story , " she said			1
" i am certain of it			0
" on another continent , on the southern end of the @entity186 , @entity47 , also dreamed big			2
as president of @entity191 , a group campaigning for press freedom , she was a voice of protest long before the @entity6 took root in @entity24			2
this year , she came to be known as @entity24 's mother of the revolution			1
by late january , the 32 - year - old mother of three children was out on the streets of @entity200 , rallying protesters to call for the ouster of president @entity203			0
she was threatened repeatedly and detained			0
but that did n't stop her			0
@entity24 women , inspired by her courage , followed @entity47 's lead and called openly for change , a daring act of defiance in the conservative @entity212 country			1
saturday , she was asked if @entity24 was perhaps the worst place on earth for women			1
she replied : " it 's the worst place to be human			2
we believe our freedom will come through freedom for all of society			0
" @entity203 has stepped down but not relinquished power , she said			0
and he will never leave @entity24 on his own accord			2
she took the @entity30 interview opportunity to ask the world to step up pressure on @entity203 as they had done on @entity227 and @entity228			0
she did not want the killings and injuries of 28,000 @entity24 to be in vain			2
@entity203 , is a liar , she said			0
" and he will continue lying			0
" she said she would n't mind running for president herself			0
will there be a free and fair election in @entity24 ? " do we have this opportunity ? please ask this to the @entity242 administration ? " she said			2
but one thing she was sure of			0
" if i will run , i will win , " she said			2
" and i will take more than 90 ( percent of the vote )			0
" it was that confidence , that courage that had brought her and her two fellow laureates to the @entity0 's celebratory stage			2
for them , the @entity30 was hardly a finality , but another beginning			0
@entity2 's @entity252 reported from @entity0 , @entity1 , and @entity253 from @entity254			0
@entity2 's @entity255 and @entity256 contributed to this report .			0
