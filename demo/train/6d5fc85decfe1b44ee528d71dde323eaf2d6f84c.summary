-- it 's been six years -- 2007 , if you 're into counting numbers -- since the once sleepy fishing port of @entity5 surpassed @entity6 as the world leader in gambling revenue			1
and the occasional winning night at the tables			0
but there 's a slower side to this city of just less than 600,000 residents , one of cobblestone lanes , colonial mansions , art deco buildings and tranquil parks , all done in a fusion of @entity24 and @entity25 motifs			1
the best part is that @entity5 ( just an hour from @entity27 by ferry ) is compact , making it a breeze to explore			1
@entity31 is the game of choice @entity5 is the gambling capital of the world			1
by far the most popular game is baccarat , a relatively simple game with a low house advantage ( less than 1 % )			0
@entity31 tables dominate the city 's 33 casinos			2
there are plenty of slot machines as well , but they offer a high house advantage and are n't popular			2
this is the reverse of @entity6 where gamblers favor slots			0
@entity5 's revenue from gambling is $ 33 billion , more than five times that of the @entity6			1
tycoon @entity54 's 40 - year reign as the city 's casino kingpin came to an end in 2002 when the @entity5 government ended the monopoly system			1
today , there are six casino operators : @entity63 ( @entity54 ) , @entity5 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			1
@entity5 was the first and last @entity68 colony in @entity24 the @entity25 settled in @entity5 in the 16th century and the island was handed back to @entity24 in 1999			1
today , @entity5 is a @entity70 ( @entity70 ) -- as is @entity27 -- and is governed under the " one country , two systems " principal , which was the brainchild of late paramount leader @entity75			1
although no longer a colony , @entity25 is still an official language and the @entity25 influence can be seen everywhere from blue tiled street signs to tiled floors and beautiful gardens			1

it 's the world 's most densely populated place @entity5 has the world 's highest population density with 20,497 people per square kilometer			1
no surprise then that it needed to do something dramatic to make room for new casinos and 30 million visitors that come every year			0
the solution was a massive land reclamation project that joined the two islands south of the mainland -- @entity99 and @entity100			0
this gave @entity5 an extra 5.2 square kilometers to create a gambling mecca to rival @entity6			1
it 's known as the @entity103 -- drawing on the names of the two islands , @entity99 and @entity100			2
the @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 are all on the @entity103			0
there 's another big one on the way -- @entity112 is spending $ 4 billion on a huge resort called @entity114 set to open in 2016			2
@entity99 is still chill the most southern island , @entity99 , remains wonderfully untouched by the casino craziness			0
this is largely due to strict rules over title deeds that make it difficult to buy property on the island			0
the low - rise houses and quiet tree - lined streets that give @entity99 its charm remain as they have for decades			0
@entity99 is home to lord @entity129 , birthplace of @entity5 's much - loved egg tart			1
not too sweet , these tarts with their crispy pastry are worth queuing for			0
another @entity99 favourite is @entity136 's			2
like the rest of @entity99 , it 's super laid - back and the food is reliably good			2
the garlic prawns and suckling pig are must orders			0

heritage is here to stay before the big casino operators rolled into town the @entity5 government did something clever -- it applied to @entity149 for @entity151 status			1
in 2005 , the historic center of @entity5 was put on the list			2
the city 's historic monuments are one of the city 's biggest draws , a wonderful example of the early encounter between @entity24 and @entity68 civilizations			1
the old heart of the city is small and a walking tour can easily take in the key sites from the iconic @entity165 , the @entity166 , the beautiful churches and temples and the old city wall			0
most of the sites are open daily and free to visit			0
@entity172 cuisine is fusion food @entity172 cuisine is unique to @entity5 and combines the best of @entity24 and @entity25 ingredients and cooking along with influences from @entity178 , @entity179 and other former @entity25 colonies			1
there 's plenty of seafood -- codfish , sardines , crab -- as well as rabbit , duck and chicken			2
@entity25 influence is seen in the flavoring , with plenty of turmeric , cinnamon , chili and coconut			1
dishes are often baked or roasted for a long time to allow the flavors and spices to develop			0
@entity5 's caldo verde soup is a popular starter and is similar to the @entity25 original , but uses bok choy instead of collard greens			1
the national dish is minchi -- minced beef or pork cooked with potatoes , onions , soy sauce and sometimes an egg			0
broken tooth is out and about he was once @entity214 's most feared gangster , the leader of the @entity215 , and after 13 years behind bars he 's now a free man			2
@entity217 was born in @entity5 's slums and worked his way up triads			1
along the way he broke several teeth in street fights and earned his nickname			0
as head of the largest triad society in @entity5 , he and his crew waged a violent turf war against a rival gang , the @entity230 , in the years running up to the 1999 handover			2
it was a time of drive - by shootings and car bombs that came to an end only when he was jailed in 1999			0
@entity212 must have had a shock when he was released in december last year			0
@entity5 changed dramatically while he was in prison and the swathe of new monster casinos has totally transformed the city			2
today , the triads have almost total control of the junket operators and keep a low profile			0
it 's a city of longevity people in @entity5 live a long time -- an average of 84.4 years			1
@entity5 takes second place in global life expectancy			1
only the residents of @entity254 -- ironically another place beginning with the letter " m " that 's known for its casinos -- live longer ( 89.6 years )			1
the fantastic economy is thought to have a lot to do with the great life expectancy			1
this year @entity5 was named the world 's second fastest growing economy ( after @entity263 ) and more than 50 % of @entity5 's revenue comes from gambling			1
so while the chain - smoking high rollers might be knocking off years with stressful , risky gambles , the locals are almost guaranteed their golden years			0

one in five locals work in a casino @entity5 's casinos employ 20 % of the population			1
when a casino takes on new staff , it checks to see if he or she has family working in the casino and in which section , to avoid the possibility of fraud			0
locals rarely visit the casinos to gamble and government employees are forbidden from gambling here			2
the overwhelming majority of gamblers are from mainland @entity24 and @entity27			2
new regulations brought in early this year means that 50 % of a casino floor must be non-smoking			0
the massive open plan @entity291 -- the largest casino floor in the world -- uses a smart ventilation system that creates areas of low and high pressure to ensure that the smoke is drawn up into air vents			2
the beach has black sand @entity301 -- which translates as " @entity302 " -- is @entity5 's largest natural beach			1
it 's on the southeast side of @entity99			2
the beach is a kilometer long and famous for its black sand			0
it gets its unique color from minerals in the seabed that are washed ashore			0
the sand is n't as black as it used to be			0
erosion was gradually chipping away at the beach so the government decided to top up the beach , but the replacement sand is yellow , which has muted the dark sand			0
