@entity0 , @entity1 -- much of the world got to know her as col. @entity5 on the " @entity6 " television series			1
though she later played @entity10 on " @entity11 , " there was something about that spandex that was hard to forget			2
but today , actress @entity14 has found a way to combine her celebrity with the very real business of fan - based conventions			1
at events like @entity23 in @entity0 , the woman known for playing strong female characters now uses her brains to wrangle issues for her celebrity clients as they prepare for close encounters with fans			1
@entity14 runs a company called @entity30 , which represents about 35 celebrity clients at conventions around the world			1
@entity2 caught up with her at @entity23 in @entity0 ( unofficially referred to as " @entity34 " )			2
@entity23 is known for being the most " fan - friendly " convention , which , in itself , can pose both unique opportunities and unique challenges			1
heading into the weekend , there were 35,000 people expected to attend , primarily to see some of the 400 celebrity guests who sign autographs and mingle with the crowds			2
@entity14 knew this meant that there were a lot of things to plan for			1
" we create 30 - page spreadsheets so that we can keep track of where we are in the process , " @entity14 said			1
" are the contracts signed ? have the photos and bios been sent ? are the travel details done ? " today , the former space colonel walks a fine line between getting her clients closer to their fans at conventions and keeping them away			1
" we 've had death threats before , " she said			2
" i 've had my own personal stalker			0
i would get nude drawings of my body with a knife and a message saying ' i 'm watching you ' and ' i 'm going to get you			0
' when you have a baby , you just feel so vulnerable			0
we could n't figure it out because it was happening at the studio , " @entity14 said			1
incidentally , it turned out to be a security guard			1
" the other one , i would get these 10 - page tiny handwritten letters front and back and perfect penmanship , and he would say things like ' do n't tell your husband about our relationship			0
' and you know how i found out who it was ? he said , ' when you waved at me			0
' i waved to my postman			0
this is before we had stalking laws			0
and when something like that happens , you think , ' is being an actress worth it ? ' " luckily , @entity14 does n't have those terrifying experiences anymore , but now she has clients who do			1
" i have a couple of clients who give me the names of their stalkers , and i have to let the promoter know who they are and to keep an eye out for them			2
i have one who is obsessed with a female celebrity , and this guy e-mails me , texts me , and he 'll come to a show and stand about 20 feet away and stare at her			2
we 'll hire security , and they will be with security all day long , " @entity14 said			1
" every actor has their stalker			0
" but the reality is that conventions like @entity23 can help make or break an actor 's career			2
we are no longer living in the age of @entity128 executives determining who the stars will be , @entity14 said			1
we are living in an age of social media , where the fans have a louder voice than ever before			0
for example , @entity14 has one client whom @entity128 paid no attention to			1
so she went out on her own and started a webcast , and today has more than 1.7 million followers on @entity140			0
ouch ! that 's got ta hurt all of those people who told @entity143 , " do n't call us ; we 'll call you			0
" " i think there 's been a major shift in grass roots media because of the internet and because the geeks and nerds rule the world			0
they are in control in so many ways			0
the comic is today 's @entity156 , so many movies , and i think that if actors want to optimize their longevity , it 's important for them to meet the fans because those fans are so loyal and will show up at any movie or tune in to any television show they 're on , " @entity14 said			1
the shift in @entity14 's own career from onscreen heartthrob to celebrity manager was completely unscripted			1
" as an actress reaching her mid- to late 40s and the number of roles not being there and still having kids in private schools , there came a point when i hit bottom , and i was desperate to get a job and understand that being a model and actress my entire life since the age of 15 , i did n't have the qualifications to get a normal job , nor did i want to			0
i could n't see myself in a corporate environment under the thumb of some boss , " she said			0
so she started talking to other female actresses in her position , and before long , they were telling her how she could make money at conventions like these			2
" i went online and started booking myself , and one day @entity195 called me up and said , ' what are you doing ? ' and i told him i was going to a show in @entity199 , and he said , " oh , i want to go , book me , and i 'll pay you 10 percent			0
" then @entity195 went and played golf with @entity202 , and there you have it , a business was born			0
" incidentally , both @entity195 and @entity202 made appearances at @entity23 this year , along with a host of @entity14 's other clients			1
" @entity23 is the number one , in my opinion , fan - based show in the world			2
the entire focus is on the fans for the fans to have a good time , to satisfy their desires and needs and so on			0
" thus the art of managing a celebrity			2
@entity14 says she goes to about one con a month , sometimes more			1
get the spreadsheets ready .			0

@entity14 turned heads as col. @entity5 on " @entity6 "
although not very " @entity128 , " fan conventions are essential , says @entity14 , to making it
@entity14 organizes celebrity clients ' convention *schedules* and deals with security issues
