when you 're a city 's " @entity3 " and have hailed yourself as a " passionate advocate " for job - seekers , you probably ought not blast one of those job - seekers in a snide , dismissive e-mail			1
because the @entity8 hates that sort of thing			0
but that 's what 's happened to @entity13 , who runs a popular online job bank for marketing professionals in @entity16			1
@entity13 's response to an e-mail and @entity20 request from @entity21 , a 26 - year - old planning to move to @entity16 this summer , has made the rounds on @entity24 , @entity25 and other viral hotspots after @entity21 posted it to her @entity29 account			1
and the resulting backlash is yet another cautionary tale about how posting something mean - spirited online can come back to haunt you in the social media age			1
" your invite to connect is inappropriate , beneficial only to you , and tacky , " @entity13 wrote , according to @entity21 's post			1
" wow , i can not wait to let every 26 - year - old jobseeker mine my top - tier marketing connections to help them land a job			1
" and she was just getting warmed up			0
" i love the sense of entitlement in your generation , " she wrote , then continued			0
" you 're welcome for your humility lesson for the year			2
do n't ever reach out to senior practitioners again and assume their carefully curated list of connections is available to you , just because you want to build your network			0
" she wrapped up with : " do n't ever write me again			0
" how social media can affect your job search @entity56 's original e-mail , sent february 19 , was a short message detailing her education , professional and volunteer activities and asking to join the 7,300 - member jobs list			1
she said she got @entity13 's response shortly afterward and , after composing herself , wrote a response			1
" i realize you told me to never write you again , but wanted to reach out as there has been a large miscommunication and i merely wanted to explain myself , " she wrote			0
she said she sent a @entity20 request so @entity13 could see her credentials because a friend told her not to send a resume			1
" i apologize if this came off as arrogant or invasive as that was never my intention , " she wrote			0
" i was again , hoping to join your very impressive job board but i understand you ( r ) reservations			2
" after the posts went viral ( spawning , for one , the obligatory @entity79 parody account ) , @entity13 on wednesday e-mailed an apology to the @entity81			1
she repeated the statement in an email response to @entity84 , saying she has apologized to " everyone involved			2
" " i am very sorry to the people i have hurt , " she wrote			0
" creating and updating the @entity88 listings has been my hobby for more than ten years			0
it started as a labor of love for the marketing industry , but somehow it also became a labor , and i vented my frustrations on the very people i set out to help			2
" @entity13 was named 2013 's " @entity3 " by @entity16 's branch of the @entity98			1
" i 've always been a passionate advocate for keeping talent in @entity101 , and we have so much of it in the region , " she said in her acceptance speech			0
" i want my subscribers to feel like everyone is my little sister or brother , and i 'm looking out for them			0
" on thursday , she appeared to have deleted her @entity79 account and @entity110 blog			1
" the note i sent to @entity21 was rude , unwelcoming , unprofessional and wrong ... , " she said in her e-mail			2
" @entity21 and her generation are the future of this city			2
i wish her all the best in landing a job in this great town			0
" playing it safe in the social media world on @entity79 , @entity21 confirmed having received an apology			1
" would like to let you know @entity13 has sent a very nice apology email , for which i thank her , " she wrote			2
but this may not have been the first time @entity13 has had a nasty exchange with a potential job - bank member			1
@entity130 told @entity84 affiliate @entity131 in @entity16 that he received a similar response in december when he messaged @entity13 saying he 'd been deleted from the jobs list and would like to be added again			1
" i suggest you join the other @entity88 in town			0
there is n't one , " @entity13 wrote , according to an e-mail he provided the station			2
" done with this conversation , and you			0
" according to the @entity81 , she has also apologized to @entity130			0
