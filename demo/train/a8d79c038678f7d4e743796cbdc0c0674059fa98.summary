@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is a single father , unemployed for more than a year and trying to do the best for his daughter , 3 - year - old @entity5			0
the family qualifies for the federal government 's free pre-kindergarten program , @entity9 , but has been on a waiting list for more than a year			1
it 's tough on both of them ; @entity13 has trouble finding work because he 's caring for his daughter , and he worries @entity5 is missing out on valuable early education			0
" my friend 's son got in , and at 4 , he can already spell his name , do simple math , and he is n't so shy any more , " @entity3 said			0
but @entity3 's daughter is one of thousands on waiting lists for the 49,000 @entity9 classrooms around the country - a list that might get shorter after an investigation into allegations of fraud by some applicants and @entity9 workers			1
a @entity35 investigation that concluded in may showed that several @entity9 workers committed fraud to enroll families whose incomes were above the federally mandated limit			1
@entity9 is open to foster and homeless children , kids with some disabilities , families eligible for government assistance and families with incomes below the federal poverty guideline , about $ 22,000 for a family of four			1
programs may enroll limited numbers of kids whose parents make more money			1
$ 9 billion went to support @entity9 in 2010 , and more than 900,000 children are enrolled in programs around the @entity57			1
the investigation began two years ago , after whistleblowers called the @entity35 's tip line and alleged that @entity9 workers in the @entity62 and @entity63 admitted families that made too much money to qualify			1
documents that whistleblowers leaked to the @entity35 showed that some workers admitted children whose parents made more than $ 110,000			0
in some cases , according to the @entity35 , workers may have lied or manipulated documents so their programs appeared to be within mandated enrollment targets			2
" taxpayers are being ripped off , " said @entity75 , the managing director of forensic audits and special investigations for the @entity35			0
" the real risk here is that the over-income children were being served , and the poorest children in our country are losing the benefit of @entity9			1
" a 10 - year study released in 2010 by the @entity57 @entity87 showed that @entity9 kids are better prepared academically and socially to enter kindergarten			1
they have better language skills and are better at making friends and handling classroom settings			0
parenting skills improved , too , among those whose kids were in @entity9 , according to the @entity87 study			1
@entity9 is popular , too , because it 's free , while private preschools and day care can cost more than $ 10,000 per year			1
to investigate the complaints , @entity75 sent staff members armed with hidden cameras to pose as parents interested in @entity9 enrollment			1
when parents apply , they must present tax records , pay stubs or public assistance documents that prove they meet the federally mandated income standards			0
the investigators ' documents showed they made too much money to enroll , but at eight of the 15 @entity9 centers they approached , staff members pretended they had n't seen the income levels , or they urged parents to lie			1
in a tape @entity75 showed to @entity120 in may , one @entity9 worker examined the investigators ' documents and said , " this is over income			1
" when the undercover investigators asked what to do , the @entity9 worker suggested they did n't have to put both parents ' incomes on the form			2
with a laugh , she added , " i 'm not supposed to say that			0
" another staffer joked , " now you see it , now you do n't			0
" @entity75 said he does n't believe these are isolated cases			0
" it 's pretty disturbing , " @entity75 said			0
" i believe the system is very open to fraud			2
" the problem , @entity75 said , is that @entity9 workers only have to sign a statement that they 've seen proof of parents ' incomes			2
federal rules do n't require @entity9 offices to keep income documents on file			2
" if you want to go in and say you are unemployed , you could get benefits even if you were making $ 100,000 because [ @entity9 was n't ] validating anything , " @entity75 said			2
not all @entity9 programs have been letting the income rules slide			2
@entity1 's @entity155 , where @entity3 hopes to enroll his daughter , has long kept copies of parents ' income documents			2
" our goal is to exceed those standards " for documents , said @entity160 , the program 's director			0
" in always maintaining copies of proof of income in our files , that 's enabled us to ensure that the families that deserve to be in the program are the ones who are getting into the program			2
" @entity177 , @entity9 's national director , said she took action immediately after learning about the federal investigation last spring			1
" we know that what went on the tape , [ that the worker ] engaged in some fraudulent behavior , " she said			0
@entity177 said the system is n't broken			0
" i think it 's important to note those are individuals within those programs , " she said			0
" we know the majority of @entity9 programs across the country are doing the right thing			2
" according to @entity177 , @entity9 officials advised local directors about enrollment procedures , bulked up on admissions training and now make unannounced visits to local programs			1
a new @entity87 tip line lets workers report fraud to the department , which oversees @entity9 , instead of going straight to the @entity35			1
" [ president @entity203 's ] administration will not tolerate any type of fraud , waste or abuse , " @entity177 said			0
" we will make sure that when we go out to see these local programs , that they are indeed doing the right things and that every federal dollar that goes to @entity9 is not being misused			1
" still , they have not yet taken @entity75 's suggestion to change the policies about keeping income eligibility documents			0
the issue is up for a 90 - day comment period , but the rule wo n't change unless @entity9 leaders decide it 's the best course of action			1
demand for @entity9 remains strong , even in programs where there 's no suspicion of fraud			1
for parents like @entity13 and kids like @entity5 , that means the wait continues			0
" the time we spend together has meant the world to me , but the things i 've taught her are only things i know , " @entity3 said			0
" i know they could do a much better job			0

an investigation into @entity9 enrollment practices shows some centers enroll families who make too much money
thousands are on waiting lists for the free pre-kindergarten classes
@entity9 leaders are adding more training , checks to enrollment to prevent fraud
