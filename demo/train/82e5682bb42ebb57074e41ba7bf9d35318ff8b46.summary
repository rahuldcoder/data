the letter called for the industry to " fully support @entity2 's decision not to submit to these hackers ' demands , " and to acknowledge " that to give in to these criminals now will open the door for any group that would threaten freedom of expression , privacy and personal liberty			1
we hope these hackers are brought to justice but until they are , we will not stand in fear			2
" in essence , the letter was " basically saying ... ' we 're not going to give in to a ransom , ' " @entity0 told @entity33			1
" as we watched one group be completely vilified , nobody stood up			2
" as far as his petition , @entity0 could n't land a single signature			1
the hack of @entity44 first came to light in november , and in the weeks since has developed into a devastating saga that 's included leaked @entity47 numbers and health information , embarrassing emails from studio execs and a threat that 's led to @entity2 canceling its release of " @entity53			1
" the movie , which stars stars @entity55 and @entity57 , has a plot that involves a plan to assassinate @entity61 leader @entity60			2
@entity63 officials believe the attack on @entity2 was ordered by @entity61 's leadership			1
@entity63 set to blame @entity61 for @entity2 hack to @entity0 , this is n't just about @entity2 , or the celebrity gossip that 's emerged			1
" we 're talking about an actual country deciding what content we 're going to have , " he told deadline			0
" this affects not just movies , this affects every part of business that we have			0
" " what happens if a newsroom decides to go with a story , and a country or an individual or corporation decides they do n't like it ? forget the hacking part of it			2
you have someone threaten to blow up buildings , and all of a sudden everybody has to bow down			0
" @entity2 did n't pull the movie because they were scared ; they pulled the movie because all the theaters said they were not going to run it			1
and they said they were not going to run it because they talked to their lawyers and those lawyers said if somebody dies in one of these , then you 're going to be responsible			0
" that sense of hesitation and fear was evident to the actor as he tried to drum up support for the studio			2
@entity0 would n't mention names , but he did say that " nobody wanted to be the first to sign on			1
" " this is n't finger - pointing , " he continued			2
" this is just where we are right now , how scared this industry has been made			0
quite honestly , this would happen in any industry			0
i do n't know what the answer is , but what happened here is part of a much larger deal			2
... and people are still talking about dumb emails			0
understand what is going on right now , because the world just changed on your watch , and you were n't even paying attention			2
" @entity0 is n't the only actor unnerved by the fallout from the @entity2 hack			1
as news spread wednesday that the studio would not be releasing " @entity53 , " in theaters or anywhere else , a number of celebrities came forward to express their frustration			0
celebrities criticize decision to pull ' @entity53 ' " i think it is disgraceful that these theaters are not showing @entity53			0

in a blog post titled " @entity167 , " @entity159 took aim at the theater chains that declined to screen " @entity53 , " causing @entity2 to shelve the film			1
" i mean , really ? " @entity159 wrote			0
" these gigantic corporations , most of which could buy @entity61 with pocket change , are declining to show a film because @entity60 objects to being mocked ? the level of corporate cowardice here astonishes me			0
" " @entity53 " was intended to open @entity178 as a lighthearted option for holiday crowds			0
but while " @entity53 " may once have been just " a silly comedy , " " what it now says about us is a whole lot , " @entity0 said			1
" we have a responsibility to stand up against this			1
