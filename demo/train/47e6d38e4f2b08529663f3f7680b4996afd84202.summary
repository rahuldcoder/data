-- there were many areas of agreement on past policies monday night in the presidential debate			1
the problem for @entity7 was with the one major disagreement on future foreign policy			2
i 've always taught my debate students that in any argument , whether at home , at the office , or in public debates , it 's important to find areas of agreement			1
there are two reasons for this			0
the first is so that you build up your credibility for when you need it on more important issues			2
in a debate , if you 've already agreed with your opponent on some topics , the audience is more likely to believe you when you finally disagree			0
and the second reason for agreement is that it lets you pick your battles			0
explicitly agreeing with your opponent is a terrific and underused debating strategy that lets you succeed when arguing for bigger , more significant issues			0
opinion : @entity36 in command ; @entity7 plays it safe it was 40 minutes into the foreign policy debate before i heard an area of disagreement on future foreign policy direction			1
the problem was that @entity7 had not actually built up his credibility by agreeing with president @entity36 on any specific future policies			1
in failing to openly agree when possible , @entity7 lacked the credibility needed when that first big disagreement came			1
and when he finally did disagree ? best said by the @entity51 in the @entity53 movie : " he chose -- poorly			0
" the question was posed to @entity7 on how he would pay for his proposed $ 2 trillion increase in military spending , and he flat out did n't answer it			1
he was busy finishing his previous answer			0
so by the time it was the president 's turn , @entity36 actually said , " you should have answered the question			0
" @entity36 then asserted that the @entity64 spends more on its military than the next 10 countries combined			1
that 's a great attention grabber			0
by the time @entity7 finally answered , he simply said we needed a stronger military , and the @entity71 needs more ships because it has fewer ships than it did in 1916			2
but @entity36 countered with the most memorable line of the night			2
" we also have fewer horses and bayonets			0
" @entity36 's debating point was that the nature of our military has changed			2
he continued by saying that the @entity64 has things like submarines and aircraft carriers that should suffice , and reminded viewers that the nation needed to study what its threats are and put money into things like cybersecurity and space			0
@entity36 said that the military neither wants nor has asked for this extra $ 2 trillion			1
opinion : @entity7 endorses @entity36 's national security policies this was terrible for @entity7 for three reasons			1
first , it was the original area of real disagreement , and @entity7 could n't afford to be bested			0
second , no matter what he may actually know , @entity7 looked like a neophyte when it comes to military spending , as though he were repeating old @entity103 talking points			1
viewers could be left unsure whether he knew what century this is			0
and finally , it 's two freaking trillion dollars ! they both talked about the budget deficit and the need to balance the budget , and over three debates , this -- $ 2 trillion on military spending -- was the biggest difference on offer			1
axing @entity116 would net a president @entity7 next to nothing in savings , but adding $ 2 trillion to defense sounded excessive , especially if it 's true that the @entity64 already spends more than the next 10 countries combined			1
i pored over my notes			0
the candidates had some other differences on future policies , such as who could be a better bff to @entity128 ( arguably , with his relationships in @entity128 , @entity7 might be , but he showed no actual specifics on how his policies would differ from @entity36 's ) and what represents the greatest threat to @entity64 ( @entity36 said terrorism , with some @entity136 economic arguments , while @entity7 said a nuclear iran ; but each man failed in monday night 's debate to show why this difference was important )			1
but the topic i could n't forget was defense spending			0
@entity36 also had a theme in the debate , and he played it more often than the melody in @entity147 's " @entity146			2
" the president continually said that @entity7 sends mixed messages and that he 's all over the map			0
@entity36 smartly tied this to specific comments from @entity7 's past ( examples were @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 ) and used @entity7 's own words against him			1
opinion : was @entity36 too relentless with @entity7 ? @entity36 repeatedly chided him , saying that @entity7 needs to be clear in what he says and what he means , while reminding us that in a president , we need steady and thoughtful leadership			1
this was the president 's best debate when referring to @entity7 's ever - changing positions , since he actually tied it to important foreign policy issues and the real challenge of being a commander in chief			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .			0

@entity176 : candidates had many areas of agreement in third presidential debate
he says agreeing is a good strategy to build credibility in debate ; @entity7 missed chance
when @entity7 was asked about paying for $ 2 trillion in military spending , he *dodged* , he says
@entity176 : it let @entity36 deliver a line that would stick ; made @entity7 seem naive on spending
