-- imagine if @entity1 had been a @entity2 feminist living in @entity4 's @entity3			2
imagine she was a lesbian with gravitas , an immigrant rights activist with spunk , sass and a wickedly mischievous sense of humor -- and you have @entity11 , an advice columnist widely known and beloved in the @entity14 community			1
she died this weekend , at 69 , and her dignified and elegant persona , her significance in @entity4 's theater world , its artistic community , @entity20 life , and journalism can not be overstated , even if you 've never heard of her			1
an oldest of three children , ms. @entity11 , who was born in a @entity24 , @entity2 , came to @entity4 in 1961 with her siblings and parents , and before long worked in the theater			1
she would go on to be a playwright , and among the most important plays she wrote was " @entity30 , " a searing exploration of the role of women in society			1
it was written two decades ago , but many of the issues that plagued women then , particularly immigrant women , are still being negotiated today : how to balance the desire for a meaningful career with being a mother and wife when you 're stuck in traditional , strict , and suffocating gender roles			2
she also taught classes at several colleges and wrote political columns for the @entity47 and @entity48			2
but it was in her role as the voice behind @entity53 's advice column , @entity54 , ( @entity55 ) where ms. @entity11 's generous spirit , lyrical eloquence and playful wit would find its glory			1
i had the pleasure of hiring her when i was @entity53 's editor - in - chief 15 years ago			1
though the column name was a sweet coincidence -- a play on the @entity3 verb for pain , dolor -- once ms. @entity11 took it over in the spring of 1998 , it took fabulous form			1
this was the @entity20 woman 's answer to @entity1			2
ms. @entity11 gave the column guts and grit			1
in one of her last responses , published in the current issue of @entity53 , a woman from @entity81 who described herself as being " white and @entity82 " longed to be proud of her heritage			1
news : @entity11 , " @entity85 , " dies ms. @entity11 's response : " when you say you can pass for either , ' depending on how i dress , wear make up and do my hair , ' you are stereotyping yourself based on an imagined cultural identity centered on looks and behaviors			1

" the zinger ? " and stop hanging out with people who judge you based on your hairstyle or outburst of sassiness			0
" in a 1998 column that was vintage @entity105 , a reader sought advice : " i 'm married , but i 've fallen in love with the young man who works at the corner store			2
he does n't know it yet			0
i do n't know what to do			0
" the answer ? " dear @entity113 : do your shopping elsewhere			0
@entity117 ! " -- @entity105 " ms. @entity11 's work as an advice columnist was remarkable because of the many lenses through which she viewed life , among them : immigrant , @entity2 exile , poet , community activist , sister , friend , mentor , immigrant rights advocate , lesbian , cook , smartass -- a candid soul filled with wisdom and fully - lived experiences			1
she 'd been born in 1943 and she delivered good old - fashioned wisdom for women of the 21st century			0
it 's almost a poetic irony that a woman whose name in @entity3 means many pains brought so many of us so much joy and light			1
hours before dying of a heart attack , ms. @entity11 celebrated the 20th anniversary of @entity147 , " @entity148 , sort of , " a women 's group that we are both part of			1
but there is nothing " sort of " about this unofficial group of gals			0
among its members are a publisher of a large metro newspaper , several @entity161 and @entity162 winners , writers , lawyers , producers			0
there 's even a justice in the group , as in @entity170 @entity169 , who decided to pay a surprise visit that night to toast our enduring friendships			0
near midnight ms. @entity11 complained of a slight stomachache and left quietly , as if not to disturb the flow			1
she did not say goodbye , but earlier in the evening she 'd revealed to the group that she would be 70 this year			0
she could hardly believe it herself			0
she looked radiant and bursting with energy and ideas			0
a few blocks from her house , we later learned , she called her sister and asked her to pick her up , as she was not feeling well			0
during the ride to the hospital , the paramedics asked her name , and ms. @entity11 instead of repeating her information , responded by telling them that she was just at a party and she was dancing -- that she was dancing for joy			1
she died several hours later at @entity191 , surrounded by her two sisters and niece			2
she 'd been working on a book , " how to become an @entity198 in 100 films " and told me that finishing was a challenge because she was n't sure she wanted to include modern flicks			2
she did n't care much for them ; she loved the black and white classics			0
of course she did : classic , like her			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204			2

her plays spoke to @entity53 experience in @entity198 ; her advice columns were wise , frank , witty
@entity207 : her last hours were joyous , spent with friends ; she brought many joy and light
