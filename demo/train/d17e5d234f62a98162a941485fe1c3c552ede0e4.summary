the burning death filmed , produced and edited on videotape is a watershed moment for @entity4 and for the @entity5			1
it is clear now that @entity4 was never going to release @entity8 , there was never going to be a deal			1
the hoax of an alternative outcome in exchange for the failed suicide bomber was nothing more than an effort to humiliate @entity5 and demonstrate the growing power of the movement			2
the main objective of such a strategy is simply to widen the base of supporters in the region and inside of @entity5			2
the @entity23 says there are between 20,000 and 31,000 isis fighters in @entity26 and @entity27 , and the great majority of these foreign fighters are from @entity5 , @entity30 and @entity31			2
there are three messages to understand from today 's barbaric footage			2
first , @entity4 is about death or nothing			1
there is no end game			0
this is not a movement that wants longevity as their every action is designed to alienate themselves from moderate @entity45 and all other decent human beings			1
their actions are designed to provoke violent response so that they can achieve martyrdom			1
there is no focus on expanding and maintaining their territorial boundaries as their external pushes are too infrequent to imply a master strategy and their fighting force , asymmetric and able but too thin to maintain an all - out conflict with the technologically superior western forces			0
the wider their spread , the weaker their ability to maintain the gains			0
there are no obvious objectives			0
the only result they want is more violence as violence is what swells their ranks			1
second there is a history between @entity4 and @entity5 , which has cracked down on the group 's supporters , putting many in jail			1
@entity4 started out with @entity80 in @entity26 , whose senior official was the @entity5 , @entity83			1
he split from @entity80 because that group disagreed with his radical approach of even killing moderate @entity45			1
@entity86 took his fighters and joined with elements of @entity89 , which was fighting in @entity27 , laying the foundation for the creation of the modern - day @entity4			1
@entity86 was killed in a @entity93 - led strike in june 2006			0
according to @entity101 from the @entity102 at @entity103 " there is a silent minority of supporters in the country but the majority moderate and outraged population 's cry will get louder			2
many do n't want @entity5 involved in the bombing campaign against @entity4 [ alternative name for @entity4 ]			1
this will cause cracks within the country			0
" there is no underestimating the anger in @entity5 over this			0
lt. @entity8 came from a powerful family and a powerful clan within @entity5			0
this can not be underestimated in terms of @entity5 's next steps			0
" @entity5 is a strong @entity93 ally and it would be inconceivable that the @entity93 is not going to respond to this in some capacity			0
the third message is a lesson taken from @entity123			1
pirates in that lawless country were able to terrorize the @entity127 waters because the world allowed it			0
violence by the pirates became normalized and the west accepted the increased business and financial risk			2
only when a focused crackdown was put in place did the success of piracy abate , however , as soon as the ships move , piracy will see a resurgence			1
this is the problem we face now with @entity4			1
sending troops or assistance , or technical advisers or funding or weapons will only work so long as that assistance is maintained			0
@entity101 adds " what we appease we allow			2
what we fight we make stronger ideologically			0
@entity4 needs to be wiped out but it is the idea that their behavior is acceptable that must be wiped out			1
@entity155 will only consume the whole body , eventually			0
" killing the idea that we accept this barbarism is the mission that must be embraced			0
there will be a response .			0

every action by @entity4 designed to alienate moderate @entity45 and decent human beings , *writes* @entity165
@entity165 : only result they want is more violence as violence is what swells their ranks
in @entity123 only when a focused crackdown was put in place did the success of piracy abate , she adds
