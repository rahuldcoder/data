@entity6 was being transported wednesday to a safe location to receive medical attention , according to a statement from @entity18 , a group that he co-founded			2
" @entity6 spent 18 harrowing days incarcerated in @entity4 , accused of kidnapping a child despite undeniable evidence that the child in question had died at @entity25 last february , " the group said in a statement			1
" no charges were brought against @entity6 ... even though he was held in the notoriously dangerous penitentiary for two weeks , " the statement said			1
@entity6 had been held in the @entity28 in @entity7			1
interviewed by phone from an undisclosed location on wednesday , @entity6 said a judge had found " contradictions " in statements from the boy 's father			1
@entity6 said the boy 's parents had been trying to extort him and that " it was a matter of a father and a mother trying to make a dime off of their kid			1
" a @entity25 judge had concluded that sufficient evidence existed to hold @entity6 while investigators evaluated the father 's complaint that the @entity3 kidnapped his critically - ill son from a hospital , according to @entity51 , a spokesman for the @entity52 in @entity4			1
the @entity18 is a humanitarian organization that seeks to provide logistical support to medical workers in @entity4 , where a major earthquake caused extensive damage in january			0
according to the group 's website , @entity6 lives in @entity60 , @entity61			2
@entity6 was working at the @entity25 in @entity62 in february when a @entity25 man sought treatment for his 15 - month - old son			1
accounts differ as to what happened next , but the father believes the child survived and that @entity6 kidnapped him , according to @entity51			0
@entity6 's supporters , including two physicians , have said the child died , and that his body was cremated because the father would not claim the remains			2
dr. @entity75 , a volunteer physician on staff at the @entity25 , said he was present when the child 's father returned to see his son and " witnessed as the father looked at the baby for several minutes , waiting for the baby to breathe			0

@entity101 said he told the father that the boy had died and instructed him to return within 24 hours to take the body			0

@entity101 and @entity6 's organization said a doctor who treated the boy has signed an affidavit confirming that the child died , saying that the father had viewed the body and that he had declined to claim the remains because he did not have resources to bury the child			1
@entity101 said earlier that he believed @entity25 authorities were trying to extort money from @entity6			2
a friend of @entity6 's recently expressed concern that the relief worker would face danger upon being released			2
" i think the biggest concern i 've got for his safety once he 's out of prison , " said @entity126 , a fellow aid worker , " is that , you know , people surrounding this case may not be happy with the ruling that 's happened and may come after him in some sense			0
" but @entity6 said wednesday that he hopes to do more aid work in @entity4			1
" i would n't say that anybody needs to have second thoughts about coming down here , " he said			0
" if any aid workers want to do work in @entity4 they should absolutely do it			1
the people here absolutely need it			0
" the @entity3 was keeping close watch on the case , the @entity149 has said , but it was unclear whether officials were working for @entity6 's release			2
