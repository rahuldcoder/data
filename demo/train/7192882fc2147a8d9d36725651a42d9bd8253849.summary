-- sporting a head bandage after a painful earlier clash it just had to be @entity4 to perform injury time heroics to salvage a vital 2 - 2 draw for @entity7 against @entity8 sunday			1
@entity9 international defender @entity4 bravely powered a bullet header from an @entity12 corner into the visiting net with his team down to 10 men			2
referee @entity16 had added nine minutes of extra time -- ironically most of it as a result of the injury suffered by @entity4 after being accidentally caught by the studs of @entity22			1
looking a little dazed , he looked set to be substituted but instead was patched up with the bandage and carried on			0
but trailing to goals by @entity27 and @entity22 , @entity7 looked set for another damaging defeat , their cause not helped by the red card needlessly gained by substitute @entity30 at the start of the extended added time			1
then up stepped @entity4 to power the equalizer , but there was still time for @entity36 to almost put @entity8 ahead again , his effort pushed away by @entity37			1
the result lifts @entity7 to 10th , while @entity8 moves up to sixth , four points outside of the top four			1
@entity4 shrugged off his injury when questioned after the match			2
" it was painful at the time , but i think it is all right now			0
injuries are all part of football , " he told @entity45			0
" it was a great cross from @entity12			0
i had missed a header a bit before and i have been waiting for a goal for a long time , " he added			0
@entity7 , who reached the semifinals of the @entity56 in midweek , was the dominant side in the first half and went ahead through a fine strike from @entity60			2
but the lead was short lived and @entity27 leveled with a header just before half time			0
@entity8 went ahead just after the hour mark when @entity22 connected with a @entity36 cross and @entity66 's men looked set to revenge a 5 - 1 defeat in the corresponding fixture last season			1
that came in the middle of @entity7 's superb run which saw the team narrowly fail to win the @entity76 title			0
with @entity77 leaving for @entity78 , this season has been a struggle , increasing the pressure on manager @entity81 , but @entity4 's late brave intervention could prove a turning point			2
earlier , @entity84 beat @entity85 1 - 0 in the @entity86 , with @entity87 scoring a 90th minute winner for the visitors			1
it was the fourth straight win in the fiercely contested derby for the @entity84 , easing them away from the relegation zone			2
in @entity96 's @entity95 , @entity94 tops the table ahead of the @entity99 break after a 2 - 1 win over @entity101 sunday			1
@entity103 striker @entity102 secured a ninth straight home win for @entity94 with the winner			0
it last won the @entity96 title in 2010 but under coach @entity108 leads champions @entity109 by three points .			0
