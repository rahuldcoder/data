editor 's note : @entity3 contributor @entity2 is a best - selling author whose new book , " @entity5 : a @entity6 , " will be published next month			1
@entity2 recalls @entity8 's cheerful greetings to the crew every morning on a movie set			1
( @entity3 ) -- she would come walking across the lawn just after sunrise			1
the days and nights had been long ; everyone else , as darkness turned into dawn , looked wrung out and worn down and weary			2
" morning ! " she would say , flashing that zillion - watt smile , greeting each of us by name			1
" morning , @entity8 , " we would say back , feeling gray and dull in her presence			1
this was at the @entity25 resort near @entity26 , @entity27 , almost 20 years ago			2
the only piece of writing of mine that was ever turned into a feature film was being shot there			1
@entity8 was one of the female leads			1
at least she , and we , thought she was			2
she seemed to be an awfully nice person			2
that much i can tell you , from my limited time with her as she made that movie			2
she did her best to try to make the people around her forget just how all - reaching her fame was			1
there is a stratum of renown that is separate from the variety that accrues to most performers ; @entity48 , who died on the same day as she , knew that type of renown , and so did she			2
regardless of the role , she was always destined to be , in the eyes of the public , @entity8			1
that had to have been both a blessing and an encumbrance			2
most people in show business would do just about anything to possess that level of connection with the people out in the seats -- to move through life having everyone in the world feel they know you			2
it must be difficult , though , to bury yourself in a fictional part when , inside , you are resigned to the idea that , to the unseen ticket buyers in the darkness , you are , now and always , @entity8			1
any person with whom she had contact , however brief , would remember it for years			2
she was golden , literally ; it was her calling card			2
at breakfast , on the mornings she would join the crew , we would sit around long wooden catering tables , and there was a what 's - wrong - with - this - picture aspect to the scene			1
these were mundane meals , and she was anything but			2
or that 's what we thought			0
@entity8 ? she was just getting ready to put in a day 's work			1
the movie itself -- it was called " @entity98 " -- turned out to be quite forgettable			0
the male lead was played by @entity100 ; the three women in his life were played , as the script was written , by @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity8			1
everyone on the set seemed to get along , but what do i know ? i 'd never been on another set			0
after a lifetime of grunted hellos from assistant city editors , this was quite a change			0
those dawns on the desert , those cast - and - crew breakfasts , those " morning ! " s from @entity8 as she strolled across the grass			1
@entity119 , a luminary in the early days of television and a cogent observer of the world around him , said that when people see a person who is regularly on tv , it is as if the television performer emits a glow			0
the glow is invisible , yet it 's there			0
and when a person who once was constantly on television suddenly is n't on television anymore , @entity119 said , it is as if the glow evaporates			0
maybe he was right -- but with @entity8 , the glow endured			1
another accomplished television performer -- @entity142 -- argued that there was no essential difference between @entity146 's fame and the fame of a local tv weathercaster			1
@entity142 's point was that you 're either famous or you 're not ; there 's no in - between			0
if you deliver the weather news on your town 's most popular station , then everyone within the county line knows you			0
the theory made a certain sense , but there was that qualitative difference to @entity8 's fame			1
she could not have gotten rid of it if she had wanted to			0
yet no one always wins			0
the most blessed among us are subject to hurt			0
here is what happened with that movie that was filmed on the desert : months after the final scenes were shot , i received a phone call from one of the producers			0
" @entity8 's not in the movie , " he said			1
i did n't process the words			0
" she asked for her name to be taken off the credits ? " i said			0
" no , " he said			0
" she has been cut out of the final film			1
" the powers that be with the authority to make such decisions , the story went , after some screenings in front of test audiences had decided that the movie did n't work well with @entity8 in it			1
so every single one of her scenes had been excised			0
the movie had been recut as if she had never existed			0
even when you 're golden , it seems , life can blindside you and try to make you feel small			0
even when , to those on the outside , it appears that you have everything , it can vanish			0
somewhere , in metal film cans on some shelf or other , there are colorful motion images of a beautiful woman doing her job , images the world has never seen			1
" morning ! " she would call on her way to breakfast			0
she carried the sunrise with her			0
