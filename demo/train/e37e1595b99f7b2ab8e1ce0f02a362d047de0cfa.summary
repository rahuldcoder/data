-- with my last @entity0 column , i managed to start a small kerfuffle among conservatives			0
i wrote about how pathetic it is that historically , most @entity7 - winning directors and producers have been white men — and how this reflects implicit bias more broadly in @entity11 and our society in general			2
some people on @entity16 criticized my argument			0
among other things , they accused me of playing the race card -- echoing a very contorted line of conservative idea that liberals who call out racism in society are actually the racists			0
and so i responded with a question : this was a question to conservatives about how they would otherwise explain the lack of black @entity7 - winning and nominated directors and producers , if they do n't attribute it to racism			2
however , conservatives interpreted the question as though i was blaming them for implicit racial bias in @entity11			0
for the record , i was not			0
what i was doing was accusing our dominant cultural institution in @entity39 of at the very least failing to challenge the implicit biases of society in general and at worst replicating them			2
in my original essay , i wrote : " @entity11 exclude women and people of color in powerful director and producer roles more than other facets of @entity39 business and society ? probably not , but who cares ? that does n't make the critique any less worth leveling			1
" which brings us to kerfuffle number two			0
saturday evening , while watching the @entity57 animated film " @entity58 " with my 5 - year - old daughter , i tweeted : yet again , i got rapped for it			1
reactions ranged from " children do not need to be indoctrinated into your pro-dyke anti-natural family propaganda " to " kids movies should be off limits to far left ideology			2
" some even accused me of being a pedophile			0
and my tweet was reposted and condemned on several conservative websites , from @entity72 to @entity74 's @entity73 and more			0
and so , since conservatives are jonesing for a conversation about this , let 's have at it ! culture with a capital - c is political			1
the rise of @entity84 or @entity85 is as much about talent as a calculation on the part of the record industry to factor in race			0
women 's necklines and hemlines are conscious decisions about gender and sexuality made by the fashion industry			0
and yes , @entity57 movies are political , too -- from the decision that all the female characters should have one - inch waistlines to the idea that princes are heroes and princesses need saving to the fact that all @entity57 princesses were white until @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 came along			1
choices about what families are portrayed or excluded in @entity57 movies , and children 's movies in particular , are political			1
laws prohibiting interracial marriage were struck down by the @entity117 in 1967 , but as far as i know , there has still not been a biracial or multiracial family at the center of a @entity57 film ( though at least @entity123 is potentially a teeny - weeny step in the right direction )			1
despite the fact that one in four children in the @entity39 today is being raised by a single parent , single moms in @entity57 movies are mostly portrayed as evil ( think " @entity132 " and " @entity133 " )			1
at least single fathers get better treatment ( " @entity136 " and " @entity137 " )			0
while it appears that there is a gay family depicted in @entity57 's latest film , " @entity58 , " and there are six other reasons why " @entity58 " may be the most forward - looking @entity57 film yet , the film still continues a long and unbroken chain of hetero - normative children 's movies			1
@entity148 : meet @entity57 's first same - sex couple ! look , i 'd be happy if we could get a brave , independent , non-offensively - skinny , non-obsessively - boy - crazy princess who is n't then photoshopped for sex appeal			1
that would be nice for my daughter to see			0
but of course i want to see children 's films go a step further and actively reflect the full , positive diversity of families in @entity39 today -- including gay families like mine			1
after all , we 're talking about @entity11 -- land of the gays and those who love them ! is this really too much to ask ? gay rights are sweeping the globe , supported morally and politically by an overwhelming majority of @entity39			2
the fact is mass culture is incredibly , frustratingly reactionary			0
it can seem that @entity174 is twerking far before any of us are ready to see it , but the fact is that 's just the corporate - backed culture industry picking up on underground trends in mass culture and amplifying them			2
conversations about race and gender and sexuality in mainstream film often lag behind society as well			0
there are times when film can propel society in the right direction , whether it 's " @entity193 " or " @entity194 " or " @entity195 " or any other number of groundbreaking films			1
we do n't think of children 's films as a space for social progress and yet that 's exactly where our society 's norms and ideals are most embedded -- how the next generation learns right and wrong and good and evil and inclusion and exclusion can start when people are young			1
@entity11 can do a better job of making inclusive kids ' movies that reflect the wonderful diversity of 21st century @entity39			1
so yes , it 's high time that we have a @entity57 movie in which a princess marries a princess			1
and a prince marries a prince			0
and a plumber marries a schoolteacher — for crying out loud , why must everyone be royal and rich ? ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			2

@entity227 : what kind of families are portrayed in @entity57 movies are political choices
@entity227 : " @entity58 " may be the most forward - looking @entity57 film , but it still has a long way to go
she asks , why ca n't children 's films actively reflect the diversity of families in @entity39
@entity227 : it 's time that we have a @entity57 movie in which a princess marries a princess
