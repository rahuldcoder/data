@entity0 , @entity1 -- a new budget airline backed by @entity5 founder @entity4 will soon take to the @entity7 skies , promising to bring low - cost flights to millions of people in the continent			1
@entity11 , the no - frills carrier is expected to launch in three to four months , aiming to cash in on @entity14 's robust economic growth and a growing appetite for travel by its burgeoning middle class			1
the move comes after @entity20 's @entity19 teamed up earlier this month with pan-african conglomerate @entity21 to create the low - cost carrier			1
@entity23 , owner of budget airline @entity24 , has agreed to sell its aviation business to investment firm @entity27 , in which @entity19 will hold a 5 % stake			2
the new business will start operations using @entity21 existing network in @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 , before expanding to more markets in the future			1
" these four countries are currently experiencing great gdp growth , along with oil and gas discoveries and developments , " says @entity38 , chief executive of @entity11			0
" we believe that the time is absolutely right to change @entity24 into a much bigger airline based on the low - cost model which has been successful in every other part of the world , " adds @entity38 , who is @entity5 's former chief operating officer			1
the business , which will still be majority - owned by @entity21 , has set a target of carrying around 12 million passengers per year , " which creates an airline of roughly 40 aircraft , " according to @entity56 , @entity11 's finance director			2
the low - cost carrier expects to offer average fares of $ 70 - 80 before tax , which could fall to as much as $ 15 - 20 when booked early			1
" that price will absolutely democratize air travel , totally changing the way people are traveling in @entity14 , " says @entity38			1
@entity11 executives say they hope to tap @entity14 's rather underdeveloped aviation network , offering an affordable alternative in a transport environment largely dominated by difficult terrains , long bus journeys and poor infrastructure			1

" " past experience shows by halving fares , a successful low - cost carrier can encourage those people , who have never previously traveled by air , to fly			1
for @entity14 , with its densely populated cities separated by great distances -- this means a potential new market of millions , " he said after the reverse takeover by @entity23			2
in 2011 , low - cost carriers occupied 9 % of the @entity7 market , suggesting that there is a large potential for further development and growth , says aviation expert @entity91			1
he notes , however , that the big challenge for airlines is breaking into cross-border flights and launching intra-african routes			0
" at the moment access to markets on a transnational basis is governed by a set of bilateral air transport agreements , " says @entity91 , founder of @entity14 - based aviation consultancy @entity96			2
" under those agreements , governments stipulate who 's allowed to fly and how many flights			0
that really keeps a lid on things -- if you can break through those barriers and introduce competition then we should see some pretty rapid growth happening in the market			0
" aircraft manufacturer @entity115 has forecast @entity14 traffic to expand by about 6.5 % per annum between 2011 - 2020 and by 4.9 % between 2021 - 2030 , for a 20 - year growth rate of 5.7 %			2
this compares with a 4.8 % increase in demand on a worldwide basis over the next 20 years			0
" it 's no secret that @entity14 represents a massively untapped market , " says @entity91			0
" if we look at where growth is happening in the world , @entity14 is certainly up there			0
" @entity91 says that as @entity14 's cities get more populated and as demand for business is growing , the expansion of the low - cost model should revolutionize the continent 's air transport in the same way that it did in @entity136 , @entity137 and now in @entity138			1
" more people will be able to trade , more people will be able to do their tourism and it should be a good economic driver , " he says			0

@entity38 says @entity11 will raise the bar on safety and security , operating " as though it was an @entity137 airline			0
" " there 's no reason why @entity7 should n't be just as safe and secure as in an @entity137 airline and we will follow those sort of procedures , " he says			0
" now , that adds a bit cost to our operation but to my mind all of those costs are actually worthwhile to provide a safe and secure airline			0
" looking ahead , @entity38 says the biggest challenge for @entity11 is dealing with lack of airport infrastructure , as well as high taxes imposed by governments and rocketing fuel duties			1
" what we 're hoping is that governments will realize that by allowing these tax levels to come down to more normal levels , we will be able to do most markets and their total revenue will actually increase , " he says			0
but despite the challenges , @entity38 says he is " incredibly excited " about the venture , saying that there is n't a better time to enter the @entity7 market			0
" five years ago it just was n't that level of gdp growth , the spread of wealth amongst the population and the level of investment , " he says , " whereas now i think all those factors come to play and now it 's exactly the right time to do this			0
