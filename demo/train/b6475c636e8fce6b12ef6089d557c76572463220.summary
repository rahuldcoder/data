-- unmanned aircraft , for all their utility , are fairly simple beasts			0
they 're good at taking direction , but they 're not so good at processing information on their own			1
now the @entity10 figures it 's time for drones to get a lot smarter , especially as they take off or land			1
as anyone who 's ever flown knows , the runway is a crowded place			0
planes on the runway queue up to get airborne			0
planes in the air have to coordinate with @entity22 for the order in which they can safely land , taking precautions not to get in anyone 's way until it 's their turn			0
there 's a fair amount of information to rapidly process in order to avoid collisions and other accidents			1
pilots can handle that information load			2
it 's one of the big reasons why the @entity41 has been so reluctant to allow unmanned aircraft to fly over the @entity43 even robotic flights over relatively unpopulated areas along the southern border have been canceled when there 's the most routine technical hiccups			2
on tuesday , the @entity49 at @entity51 's @entity50 said it 'll soon solicit engineers to design an algorithm to allow drones to " integrate seamlessly " with piloted planes for takeoff and landing			1
in the algorithm - driven future that the labs want to build , drones will be equipped a database of terminal procedures ; link up with @entity22 ; and " recognize the intent of other aircraft			1
" for instance : aircraft landing on parallel runways can appear to be on a collision course before they turn and land			0
right now , a drone would simply perceive that a plane 's trajectory is going to remain unchanged , making it a threat for collision			0
but a capable algorithm would let the drone process @entity22 information like basic airfield maps to know that there 's no actual danger from the oncoming piloted plane			1
" the developed algorithm ( s ) , optimally , would require no more a priori information than a human pilot , " the labs instruct			2
" intent analysis should be accurate , reliable and real - time , enabling quick and appropriate decisions that are necessary in this time critical environment			2
" there 's a clear commercial application here			0
as @entity0 mentioned on wednesday , @entity95 is starting to think about an airfleet of linked - up drones that can fly in formation at the direction of a piloted aircraft			1
building algorithms that can let drones process complex information in congested airspace sounds like a useful step toward that futuristic cargo fleet			1

drones that process complex information in congested airspace could be useful
@entity49 will find engineers to *create* drones that " integrate seamlessly "
