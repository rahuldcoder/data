-- the startling thing , in the long run , is not that the power went out and stayed out in so many parts of the @entity5 during the week just ended			1
the startling thing is what we so casually take for granted : flip a switch , and the lights in your home instantly blaze to life			1
turn a knob , and clean water comes rushing into your sink or bathtub			1
pick up a telephone , and you 're talking with someone halfway across the country or halfway around the world			2
news : cold front expected to bring relief from heat , but also storms right now , the most pressing matter is to get the electricity back on in the places that are still without it			1
people are in despair ; people have died			1
fierce storms , along with near - record - high temperatures , combined during the final days of june and the first week of july to bring down multiple power systems and leave millions of people sweltering in the dark			1
but once all is up and running again , it might be good to pause and think about how fragile all of our assumptions are			1
for much of the time that the continental @entity5 has been a part of the planet , few of the life - easing developments we nonchalantly take on faith seemed remotely possible			1
electricity ? running water ? air conditioning ? they were the stuff of science - fiction novels			1
ours was a land mass of forests and rivers and deserts and plains , a tangled and disconnected tableau that disappeared from view with the blackness of night			2
we -- not you and i , but our ancestors -- figured out how to change all that			2
by the time recent generations came along , everything seemed so endlessly convenient			2
the battle for civilization had been won			2
which is why a week like the one just past is such a sobering reminder that we are always just an unanticipated disaster away from a trip into the primitive @entity5 that existed before			1
doubt it ? ask your fellow citizens who waited and waited for someone to turn their lights back on last week			2
news : @entity86 brave storms and their aftermath in the blast - oven heat that stifled much of the nation in recent days , the absence of air conditioning felt anguishing			2
but that situation was , for most of @entity5 's history , so commonplace as to be unremarkable			1
summers were for sweating , and for drawing the blinds , and for sleeping on porches			2
it was n't until the 1920s that movie theaters featured early versions of air conditioners , which proved to be an enormous draw for the public who yearned to escape their broiling homes			0
department stores in the 1930s lured customers by offering them a chilled - air respite from the scorching hours they spent in their houses			0
news : gadgets to help you survive a power outage according to the @entity117 , the pioneering air - conditioning manufacturer , as late as 1960 few college buildings featured air conditioning , and virtually no elementary or high schools had it			1
private residences ? for the most part , they were the last to convert			0
window units were available , but by 1965 , according to @entity117 , only one out of 10 @entity5 homes had central air			1
but when our daily lives change for the better , human nature lulls us into all but forgetting what preceded			0
we do n't even question the marvelous advances that once seemed out of reach			0
one of the funniest -- yet most perceptive and provocative -- news - conference questions i 've ever been aware of was asked in the 1970s by @entity135 , who was then the brilliant young television critic of the @entity136			0
if memory serves , the event was some sort of press gathering organized by @entity141 to discuss the network 's upcoming schedule			0
after the preliminary announcements , the floor was opened for questions			0
many of the reporters in attendance asked about the stars of the new shows , and about ratings trends , and about programming decisions			0
news : use caution if you drive in extreme heat then @entity135 raised his hand , and asked : " how do you make the pictures go through the air ? " as delightful as his telling of the story was back then , i thought of it again last week , in a much more serious context			0
how do the essential things in which we place our confidence really get done ? and are we right to think we can forever count on them ? the uneasiness and fear when the power went out last week extended beyond the nuts and bolts of engineering ; instead , it was almost primal			1
it was a reminder of the unthinkable , of scenarios as potentially nightmarish as a sneak attack by foreign enemies			0
it was an unwelcome premonition of things we do n't even want to consider : we flick the light switch , and nothing happens			0
we twist the knob on the faucet , and nothing emerges			0
we punch a number into the telephone , and hear only silence			0
we turn on our computers , and are greeted by blankness			0
and then , darkness falls			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			1

@entity199 : parts of @entity5 lost power ; we should *reflect* on how we take *comfort* for granted
he says not long *ago* , no one had electricity , running water ; people changed that , mostly
he says we are always one unanticipated disaster away from a trip into primitive @entity5
