@entity0 may be in the midst of an economic crisis but one company continues to sleep easy			1
@entity4 , a family business which makes beds and mattresses out of natural materials , is expanding despite the country 's economic crisis			1
the company , which has a workforce of 220 and last year raked in over $ 75 million , is based in the picturesque mountains in north - eastern @entity0			1
but it is now increasing its retail outlets across @entity16 , @entity17 , the @entity18 and the @entity19 @entity4 specializes in manufacturing sustainable mattresses and bed products made of coco fibre , natural rubber , wool , cotton , goose down , horsehair , silk , linen , wood and even seaweed			1
" @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 : they used to sleep on mattresses made out of cotton , made out of seaweed , made out of aroma therapy			2
so the principle is the same , " said @entity4 's co-founder @entity40			0
" we follow the tradition of all these wise people , and nowadays we produce non-metal beds and mattresses , " he added			2
the design and philosophy behind @entity4 has contributed to making it a commercial success both at home and abroad			0
it also has a very different approach to the " try before you buy " policy			0
in @entity57 and @entity58 the company offers potential buyers the chance to test drive its mattresses in a no - strings - attached napping arrangement			1
shoppers looking to find their dream bed are given complimentary food , drink , slippers , a robe and access to private rooms equipped with showers and comfy big beds in which they will hopefully fall asleep for a few hours at a time			0
the idea of giving customers such a different shopping experience adheres to the company 's philosophy that it takes more than five minutes to determine what type of bed you would want for the next 20 years			0
according to @entity40 , @entity0 should take this more natural approach as they seek change			2
" i believe @entity0 like me should listen to the birds , they should listen to trees , to the sea , and not to computers , to solutions in @entity93 to see what 's going on			1
i really mean it , because nature is waiting for us with a lot of chances , with a lot possibilities , a lot of solutions			0
