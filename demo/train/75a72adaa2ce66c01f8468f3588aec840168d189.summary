-- @entity1 wants to eradicate the many nuisances associated with flying			1
should they succeed , missing luggage , delayed flights and long security lines will be irritations of another era			1
even wading through a sea of taxi drivers to find the cardboard placard that bears your name will be a thing of the past			1
this streamlined experience is being delivered with the help of a technology known as the @entity20 ( @entity20 )			1
essentially , it is an overarching platform that allows a variety of devices or machines to communicate with each other			1
this " machine to machine " communication ( @entity28 ) remains in its early stages , but its application is being tested in a number of areas			1
it is the foundation for " smart cars " , vehicles which are tuned in to avoid collision , and " smart lights " , which detect when you 've woken up and then turn on			2
@entity1 is the first airport in the world to test it in the field of commercial aviation			1
technology company @entity43 and retail developer @entity44 will lead the project backed by the @entity47 's @entity46			2
over the next year , the airport will integrate different technologies to provide a taster of what 's possible			2
just what is the @entity20 ? our interactive explains all many of the more advanced features involve tracking passengers through a mix of face recognition and crowd - sourcing software that already exists in airports , plus the gps that is already available in smart devices			1
for instance , a traveler who pre-orders food online or though their smartphone will be able to have it delivered to them as they arrive at the departure lounge			2
" when someone arrives , sensors will detect that person 's frame , and will notify the @entity79 outlet to get everything ready , " explains @entity72 , @entity43 's executive vice president of sales and marketing			2
similar technology can insure that a passenger who booked a taxi in advance can exit the airport and step immediately into a waiting car			1
" there 's no reason you ca n't have an app on your phone tell you the route and the correct exit ( to find your vehicle ) , " says @entity72			2
other features will simply be about streamlining what 's already there			2
for instance , though luggage can be monitored to a degree , there 's no system in place to track it in real - time			0
what this means is that passengers and their luggage can be tracked at the same time			0
if a flyer checks his back but misses his plane , his luggage wo n't be boarded			0
infographic : what the world spends on business travel " if you 're a passenger , there will be no more sitting on a plane waiting for a bag to be found because whoever owns the bag missed their plane and now it has to be unloaded			1
everything that 's uncomfortable , inconvenient or just a pain in the neck about traveling , we 're trying to turn into a more pleasurable experience , " says @entity72			1
on the retail side , stores in the airport will use a combination of cameras and sensors to monitor buyer behavior and to get a better sense of what types of displays work			0
they will also be able to offer shoppers customized offers based on previous purchases			0
" a lot of what they 're doing is putting data together and creating information to give a better customer experience , " says @entity145 , a chief analyst for public sector technology at @entity147			1
" you may get to the point where you walk past a @entity156 , and it says , ' we noticed you bout a blouse last week , we have a sale on a skirt that will go with it			0
' " @entity145 says that some shopping malls have started embedding sensors in the floor to track where people walk , and on hangers to register which items get picked up the most			0

" i believe that as we increase our dependency on @entity20 , and because it is not a fully stable technology per se , the probability of having problems increases , " says @entity172 , the head of the secure infrastructure and services unit at the @entity175			1
" i 'm not saying it will happen , but we need to take measures now before the technology becomes commercially available			0
" @entity172 points out the potential for hackers to interfere with sensitive travel information and the smooth running of airport systems			0
" they might jam a smart device to make systems not available in the airport , or play with the bar code of flight tickets , so that you can have access to a space you should n't have access to , " he says , while admitting that these scenarios are extreme			0
for @entity72 privacy is n't really an issue , as passengers can chose whether or not they " opt in "			0
furthermore , the technology will actually allow airports to have a more sophisticated security system in place			0
" if there 's suddenly a security issue , and someone is suddenly somewhere they should n't be , the authorities can access the day - to - day information more easily , " he says .			0

@entity1 to test @entity20
will create a *network* of machines that communicate with each other
concept should create an *enhanced* and smoother passenger experience
