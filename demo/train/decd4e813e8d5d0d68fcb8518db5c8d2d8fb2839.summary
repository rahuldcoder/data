-- @entity4 's girlfriend , talking to him on the telephone , heard the teenager saying " get off , get off , " in the moments before his cell phone cut off and he was shot dead , according to a recording released friday of the girl 's interview with a prosecutor			1
another witness , however , seems to put @entity4 on top of @entity14 for at least part of the struggle , according to another recording			1
" when i first walked out there , the black guy was on top , and the only reason i can tell that was because the guy that was on the ground under him at that point wrestling was definitely a lighter color , " the man , whose name has not been made public , said in the interview			0
@entity4 was african - american			1
when first interviewed , the witness said the individual on the bottom was calling for help			0
but a few weeks later , in another interview , he said he was n't sure			0
" at first i thought it was the person on the ground , because me thinking rationally , if someone was on top , the person on the bottom would be yelling , " the witness aid			0
" i truly ca n't tell who , after thinking about it , was yelling for help just because it is so dark on that sidewalk			0
you ca n't see a mouth			0
" in his second interview , the witness said when he returned to the window while calling 911 , he saw the person who had been on top sprawled in the grass , not moving			0
another person with his hands in the air said , " the gun 's on the ground			0
i shot this guy in self - defense , " according to the witness			2
another witness said the heavier of the two individuals appeared to be on top			0
" i know after seeing the tv of what 's happening , comparing their pictures , i think @entity14 was definitely on top because of his size , " the witness said			1
the recordings provide the most detailed look yet into previously reported witness statements detailing the last moments of @entity4 's life			1
@entity4 , 17 , was shot to death february 26 while walking in the @entity80 , @entity81 , neighborhood where he was staying during a visit with his father			1
the girlfriend , whose name has not been made public , told assistant state attorney @entity86 that @entity4 got away from the man , who turned out to be @entity14 , but only temporarily			1
he was out of breath from running away and scared , she said , and decided not to keep running because he was close to the house where he was staying			0
and as @entity14 drew closer , the girl said , @entity4 called out , " why you following me for ? " according to the recording			1
" i hear this man , like this old man , say , ' what are you doing around here ? ' " the girl said			0
the girl said she called out to @entity4 , asking what was happening , but he did n't answer			1
the next thing she heard was a bumping sound , followed by what might have been a scuffle			0
" i could hear it a little bit , ' get off , get off , ' then the phone just hung up , " the girl said			0
@entity14 , a neighborhood watch volunteer , is charged with second - degree murder in the death , which sparked nationwide protests and inflamed public passions over race relations and gun control			1
another witness interviewed by police said @entity14 " looked like he had just gotten his butt whupped , " according to a recording released by authorities			1
the witness also said @entity14 seemed nonchalant about the shooting , " like it was nothing			1
" @entity14 told the witness to call his wife and " just tell her i shot somebody			2
" a woman told @entity80 officers she did not hear the sounds of fighting outside her residence			0
" i heard nothing but a little kid scared to death , like crying			1
" @entity14 has claimed self - defense in the shooting , saying @entity4 charged him after the two exchanged words , knocking him to the ground and hitting his head repeatedly against a concrete sidewalk			1
prosecutors say @entity14 profiled @entity4 as a criminal and killed him , even though he was doing nothing wrong			1
@entity14 has pleaded not guilty			2
the recordings and other documents released as part of the court case also touch on the racial component of the case			0
in one recording , a former co-worker of @entity14 's says @entity14 made him the butt of a long - running office joke , ridiculing his @entity150 accent and bullying him in what the witness described as a juvenile but infuriating effort to fit in with other workers			1
in another , an anonymous caller tells a @entity80 police officer that @entity14 and his family are racists			1
" i do n't know what happened			0
i do n't know at all , who this kid was or anything else , " the woman said			2
" but i know @entity14			2
and i know he does not like black people			0
he 's a very confrontational person			0
" some people have also attributed a racial epithet to @entity14 during his call with an emergency dispatcher			2
but an @entity174 analysis , released thursday , determined that the word could not be definitively identified " due to weak signal level and poor recording quality			0

the recordings released friday are the latest in a series of revelations from the official investigation into the shooting			0
authorities are making details of the case publicly available as attorneys prepare for @entity14 's trial			2
among the documents released was one filed with prosecutors by @entity80 police two weeks after the shooting , urging @entity14 's arrest			1
new documents shed light on @entity4 killing " the encounter between @entity14 and @entity4 was ultimately avoidable by @entity14 , if @entity14 had remained in his vehicle and awaited the arrival of law enforcement , or conversely if he had identified himself to @entity206 as a concerned citizen and initiated dialog ( sic ) in an effort to dispel each party 's concern , " the police request to arrest @entity14 said			1
" there is no indication that @entity4 was involved in any criminal activity			2
" other documents released this week include @entity4 's autopsy report and a fire department report on @entity14 's injuries			1
the autopsy report showed that @entity4 died of a gunshot wound to the chest fired from within 36 inches and that he had traces of marijuana in his blood and urine			2
in his 911 call just before the shooting , @entity14 had speculated that the teen looked like he was " up to no good or he 's on drugs or something			1
" @entity4 's blood contained @entity232 , the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana , according to autopsy results released thursday			1
the autopsy was conducted february 27 , the day after the teenager was killed			0
toxicology tests found elements of the drug in the teenager 's chest blood -- 1.5 nanograms per milliliter of one type ( @entity232 ) , as well as 7.3 nanograms of another type ( @entity245 ) -- according to the medical examiner 's report			0

no precise levels on the urine were released			0
what happened that night ? just before the shooting , @entity14 , 28 , called 911 to complain about a suspicious person in his neighborhood			2
in the call , @entity14 said he was following @entity4 after the teen started to run , prompting the dispatcher to tell him , " we do n't need you to do that			1
" prosecutors say @entity14 disregarded the advice , leading to a confrontation between the two			2
a screaming voice could be heard on other 911 calls placed by neighbors , with some speculating that those screams came from @entity4 and others that they belonged to @entity14			1
as part of an analysis released this week , the @entity174 did not make a final determination either way , citing several reasons , including the fact they came during " an extreme emotional state , " that there were n't enough words to make a good comparison and that the sound quality was low and distant			0
@entity174 analysis -- @entity14 's 911 call ( pdf -- strong language ) @entity14 claimed , according to a police report released earlier , that he 'd been " assaulted ( by @entity4 ) and his head was struck on the pavement			1
" according to a report from the @entity296 , released thursday , @entity14 had " abrasions to his forehead , " " bleeding / tenderness to his nose " and a " small laceration to the back of his head " when emergency personnel arrived at the scene at 7:27 p.m. , six minutes after they were first called			2
