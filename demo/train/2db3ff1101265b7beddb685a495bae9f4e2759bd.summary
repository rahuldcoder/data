everybody knows @entity2 has a water problem			1
@entity4 thinks he can help fix it			2
@entity6 , the founder of the @entity2 - based conservation group @entity4 , is n't planning to seed clouds or change @entity9 weather patterns			1
he has a simpler solution : conservation combined with a little old - fashioned technology , like rain barrels , trees and permeable surfaces			1
" people think we 're crazy when i say we 're working on building a new water supply that produces as much as half of @entity21 's water from local rainfall			1
they say , ' that 's great , but it does n't rain here , ' " he said			1
but even during 2013 , one of the driest years in @entity21 history , it rained 3.6 inches -- and that meant billions of gallons were washed away and wasted , he says			1
@entity6 ' organization estimates that the city lost 28 billion gallons of water that year , or 6,500 gallons per @entity21 resident			1
according to the @entity36 , the average single - family residential unit uses about 387 gallons per day , or about 130 per person			0
so that was about seven weeks ' worth , gone			0
and that was a dry year			0
( despite recent rains , 2014 was also fairly dry			0
) in an average year , @entity21 receives close to 15 inches			1
what if more of that water could be harvested instead of washed out to the @entity9 ? along with other organizations , including city and state entities , @entity4 is trying to do just that			1
@entity6 , who is fond of holding up a glass of water and announcing that he 's drinking " dinosaur pee , " likes to emphasize that water resources are finite and that nature is water 's best recycler			1
several groups have combined on a project that captures rainwater in gutters and lets the overflow get sifted through permeable surfaces , allowing nature to cleanse the runoff			0
for the @entity62 , a part of the @entity64 that routinely floods , the groups retrofitted parts of the area with collection devices , trees and landscaping			0
for one project , @entity73 , the result was enough water saved yearly to supply 30 households			2
the city , through its @entity78 agency and other departments , is now expanding such initiatives			2
and along the way it 's become an unlikely model for conservation ; @entity21 now uses less water than it did in 1970 , despite a surge in population			1
other municipalities are following suit			0
nearby @entity90 has installed a groundwater replenishment system that relies on reverse osmosis and microfiltration			0
in parched @entity95 , @entity96 , authorities have turned to recycling wastewater			0
even @entity98 -- not known for its dryness -- has adopted a number of conservation practices , says @entity6			2
education and implementation are still a work in progress , he says			0
there are political and financial considerations at work , he observes , and getting everybody on the same page is a formidable challenge in its own right			0
but @entity6 believes the payoff is huge , including jobs to create the infrastructure and more long - term water for everyone			1
" in the big picture , the state , the regional water boards , the county -- everybody is saying we need multiple approaches to solve the problem , " he said			2
" ( but ) the change is well under way			0
a lot of the fundamentals have been put in place			0
" and that 's as refreshing as a tall glass of ... you know .			2

@entity21 has become an unlikely model for water conservation
despite huge population growth , the city uses less water now than it did in 1970
one group is trying to harness the city 's rainfall instead of letting it wash out to *sea*
