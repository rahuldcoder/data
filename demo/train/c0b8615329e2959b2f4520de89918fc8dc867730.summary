-- " @entity5 " is an uplifting spiritual , one that 's often heard in churches and popularly recognized as the black national anthem			1
@entity6 grew up with its rhythms , but now the song holds a contentious place in his mind			2
" i love the song , " said @entity6 , an associate professor of @entity12 at @entity13 , a historically black college			1
" but it 's not the song that is the problem			0
it 's the label of the song as a ' black national anthem ' that creates a lot of confusion and tension			1
" the song and its message of struggle and hope have long been attached to the @entity28 - @entity28 community			0
it lives on as a religious hymn for several protestant and @entity28 - @entity28 denominations and was quoted by the rev. @entity32 at @entity34 's presidential inauguration			0
after studying the music and lyrics of the song and its history for more than two decades , @entity6 decided the song was intentionally written with no specific reference to any race or ethnicity			1
@entity6 explains his position in the new book , " cultural hegemony and @entity46 : an @entity47 , ' @entity5 , ' " which was released by @entity48 in june			1
the book explores the literary and musical traditions of the song , but also says that a national anthem for african - americans can be construed as racially separatist and divisive			1
" to sing the ' black national anthem ' suggests that black people are separatist and want to have their own nation , " @entity6 said			1
" this means that everything @entity59 believed about being one nation gets thrown out the window			0
" @entity6 first became intrigued with " @entity5 " while working on his master 's degree at @entity64			1
he was a @entity65 music graduate , young , passionate and hungry for knowledge about african - american culture			0
a fellow classmate suggested @entity6 explore @entity64 's collection on @entity70 , an early civil rights activist who wrote the song decades earlier			1
@entity70 first wrote " @entity5 " as a poem in 1900			1
hundreds of @entity28 students performed it at a celebration of @entity77 's birthday at @entity78 , @entity80 's @entity79 , where @entity70 was principal			2
@entity70 's brother , @entity81 , later set the poem to music			2
by 1920 , the @entity84 had proclaimed the song the " @entity5			2
" " i remember methodically going into the @entity64 library every day and sitting there on the floor , rummaging through 700 boxes of @entity70 's work , " @entity6 said			1
" i became so fascinated in his life and letters , that i wanted to know more about the creation of the song and how it related to our modern understanding of it			0
" he found letters of appreciation to @entity70 from individuals of all different ethnic backgrounds			2
at that moment , @entity6 had a revelation : the song he 'd known as the " black national anthem " was for everybody			1
some will call his perspective on the song a contradiction , @entity6 said , especially because he works at a historically black college			1
but he argues that universities like @entity13 accept students of many races and ethnicities ; a national anthem for one race excludes others , and ignores an existing national anthem , " @entity119 " by @entity120			1
" some people argue lines like ' we have come , treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered , ' signify a tie to slavery and the black power struggle , " @entity6 said			2
" but in all essence there is no specific reference to black people in this song			0
it lends itself to any people who have struggled			0
" he 's not the only one who sees fault in a national anthem just for @entity28			1
@entity140 , an @entity28 conservative blogger , responded to @entity6 's claims on his blog , " a free man , thinking freely			2
" he said in an interview that @entity6 is right to make connections to @entity59 's view of one @entity147			2
" @entity59 always appealed to the @entity28 dream for all , " @entity140 said			0
" he was a patriot and he never wanted blacks to deny or separate themselves from being @entity28			0
i think claiming an anthem for ourselves as black people is doing just that			2
" what troubles @entity6 more is that the song became an identity marker for @entity28			0
" who has the right to decide for all black people what racial symbol they should have ? " @entity6 said			2
" identity should be developed by the individual himself , not a group of people who think they know what is best for you			0
" @entity171 , senior vice president for advocacy and policy for the @entity84 , said @entity6 's ideas might be far - fetched			0
" i do n't see anything that is racially exclusive or discriminatory about the song , " @entity175 said			0
" the negro national anthem was adopted and welcomed by a very interracial group , and it speaks of hope in being full first - class citizens in our society			1
" " @entity5 " is n't meant to cloud national identity or persuade @entity28 - @entity28 to be separatists , @entity175 said			2
it 's often sung in conjunction with " @entity119 , " or with the reciting of the @entity189 at @entity84 events			0
" his presumption is that this song is sung instead of our national anthem -- that we are less @entity28 and we are not as committed to @entity147 because we take pride in the negro national anthem , " @entity175 said			1
" it is evident in our actions as an organization and here in @entity147 that we are about inclusion , not exclusion			0
to claim that we as african - americans want to form a confederation or separate ourselves from white people because of one song is baffling to me			0
" this is n't the first time " @entity5 " has sparked debate			0
in 2008 , jazz singer @entity208 substituted the words of " @entity119 " with the words of " @entity5 " at mayor @entity211 's @entity213 address in @entity214 , @entity215			0
@entity216 said it was a matter of artistic expression , but critics viewed the lyrical switch as disrespect toward the national anthem , a lack of patriotism and an insinuation of racial division			1
" i think that we often try to separate the black experience from the @entity28 experience , " said @entity227 , an associate professor of education at @entity228 who studies hip - hop culture			0
" it 's a black national anthem , but it 's also a quintessential @entity28 song because of its message of fighting for freedom			1
it 's not ' lift the black voices , ' it 's ' lift every voice			0
' " @entity6 , though , maintains there 's only one national anthem , " @entity119 , " and that " @entity5 " could take on a new role : a message of victory for all ethnic groups in the @entity147			1
" we need to consider eliminating this alternative label of ' black national anthem ' in order to promote unity , " @entity6 said			1
" i know people will probably think that i 'm a sellout , but i think it is important that african - americans nationally understand that we should be moving towards racial cohesiveness			0
