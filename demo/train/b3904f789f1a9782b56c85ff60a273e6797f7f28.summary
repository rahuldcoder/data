-- administration officials have said that neither the @entity2 nor the actions of allies would affect their response to @entity6			1
apparently producing conclusive evidence to link the regime of @entity6 president @entity9 to the use of chemical weapons against the nation 's citizens may not matter either			1
and yet even a brief review of 25 years of @entity16 military action teaches the tragedy of ignoring law and facts			1
just two years ago president @entity20 recognized the need for a @entity2 resolution to allow military action in @entity24			1
@entity25 authorized " necessary measures " to protect civilians			0
the resolution was needed because the use of military force is banned by the @entity31 unless it is in self - defense to an armed attack , has @entity2 authorization , or , perhaps , is taken with the consent of a government fighting an insurgency , as in @entity38			2
even officials from the @entity41 administration recognized the need for a @entity2 resolution when the @entity16 and @entity43 invaded @entity44 in 2003			2
the two nations tried to recycle resolutions from the 1990 - 1991 @entity47 when it became clear @entity2 members would not vote for a new resolution to attack @entity44			0
the case for war with @entity44 was too weak ; @entity2 members wanted to give @entity2 weapons inspectors more time			2
secretary of state @entity55 also tried to justify the @entity44 invasion by referencing @entity58 's 1999 intervention in @entity59 , which also went forward without the required @entity2 authorization			0
authorization had been withheld because the @entity2 doubted bombing would get the @entity63 to grant @entity59 independence and were not sure who was responsible for some of the conflict 's mass killings			0
indeed , rebels have an interest in showing that they are victims in order to draw in assistance			0
just a few years before the @entity59 intervention , president @entity73 had declared a new world order under the rule of law			0
he could point with well - earned pride at how , in the @entity47 , the @entity16 led a worldwide coalition , authorized by @entity79 , to liberate @entity80 -- in 100 hours of combat			0
the @entity16 received generous assistance to support its military action , with allies sending either troops , material or financial support			0
that war was fought against @entity89 , the last known leader to have used chemical weapons in war			2
he used them to suppress @entity93 @entity44 and against @entity95 soldiers during the @entity96			0
he likely then used them against his own soldiers to cover up the use against @entity95 troops when @entity2 weapons inspectors came to investigate @entity95 's claims of chemical weapons use			1
@entity20 is right to speak against chemical weapons use in the most categorical of terms			1
but the use of chemical weapons is banned by international law			1
responding by violating the international law ban on resorting to force will only undermine @entity16 's standing to condemn the crimes of others			1
@entity115 officials should put their prodigious talents and resources to use finding a lawful and effective way to respond to chemical weapons use in @entity6 and to aid in ending a tragic war without creating more tragedy			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity124 .			0

@entity124 : @entity16 says @entity2 *approval* wo **n't** affect *plans* for response to @entity6
she says ignoring international law , facts can produce tragic results such as @entity96
@entity124 : @entity20 right to denounce chemical weapons , should **n't** react outside @entity2 law
