-- the @entity1 is no longer in the running to host soccer 's @entity3 after its bid committee decided to withdraw from contention and focus on hosting the 2022 tournament instead			1
the @entity8 announced on friday it had made the decision after " several months of careful deliberation " following meetings with the sport 's world ruling body @entity12 and @entity16 's controlling organization @entity15			1
the withdrawal leaves just four candidates for the 2018 tournament -- all of them from @entity16			1
@entity20 and @entity21 face competition from dual bids comprised of @entity24 / @entity25 and @entity27 / @entity26			0
the @entity1 will be up against @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 as it seeks to host soccer 's showpiece event for the second time , having staged it in 1994			1
because the tournament can not be held on the same continent twice in succession , that means none of the 2018 bids can now target 2022 , and vice versa			1
" for some time we have been in conversations with @entity12 and @entity15 about the possibility of focusing only on the 2022 bidding process , an option we have made reference to many times , " bid chairman @entity42 , also the president of @entity43 , said in a statement			0
" we are confident this is in the best interests of the @entity8			0
we wanted to make the announcement now -- still 48 days before the final decision -- in order to make our intentions clear during the last part of our campaign			0
" @entity12 secretary general @entity60 welcomed the decision , saying it made sense given the location of the four other 2018 candidates			0
" we have had an open and constructive dialogue with the @entity8 for some time now , after it became apparent that there was a growing movement to stage the 2018 @entity69 in @entity16 , " he said			2
" the announcement by the @entity8 to focus solely on the @entity71 is therefore a welcome gesture which is much appreciated by @entity12			2
" @entity12 's @entity74 - based executive committee will meet in @entity75 on october 28 - 29 to further discuss the final voting process ahead of the december 2 decision on both tournaments .			0

@entity1 decides to focus on its bid to win right to host the @entity71
