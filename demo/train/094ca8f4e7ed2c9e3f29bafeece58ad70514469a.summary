@entity5 's first trip to @entity12 was n't exactly a success			1
@entity5 's hyper - violent , super cool debut feature " @entity17 " scorched audiences and critics alike when it came out in 1992			1
" if you do this in real life , they 're going to fire your ass , " scolded cinematographer @entity18 , veteran of films like " @entity20 " and " @entity21			2
" the novice filmmaker was participating in a directors ' workshop at the @entity30 -- the film trust founded by @entity32 which also runs the @entity12			2
unfortunately , @entity5 's mentors were just not feeling his experimental approach			1
the following week , a new group of mentors arrived , including @entity38 member and filmmaker @entity39			0
@entity5 and his editor steeled themselves for the inevitable disapproval : " then @entity39 comes in and goes ' oh , your scene			1
just great ! ' " recalls the director			2
he is talking at the @entity46 , following in the illustrious footsteps of directors like @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			0
" it was just like , you know what , that 's gon na be my career			1
people are gon na either really like me or they 're really not and just get f * * * ing used to it ' cause this is the deal , " @entity5 says			1
a second visit to @entity12 in 1992 proved more fruitful			0
his debut feature , " @entity17 , " a sassy , hyper - violent gangster movie , was the hit of the year			1
@entity68 film critic and regular on the @entity70 film festival circuit , @entity66 still remembers the effect it had on him when it showed at @entity73 later that year : " it was a big shock			1
i remember it was the most striking new @entity75 film since ' @entity76 ' 30 years before			0
" despite the impact of his droll , assured debut , @entity5 recalls being convinced he was going to get fired in the first two weeks of production			1
" i just thought it was too good to be true			0
i could n't help but think something like ' they do n't let people like me make movies , ' " he says , laughing			0
follow - up movie " @entity7 " was awarded the coveted @entity85 at @entity73 two years later , cementing his reputation as a movie - maker to be reckoned with			1
it was filled with the dark humor and bloody violence that would become known as @entity5 trademarks			1
the b - movie - obsessed director admits to getting a kick out of creating humor in inappropriate situations			2
" i 'm trying to get you to laugh at things you 've never laughed at before , " he explains			1
he cites his " bigtime " influences as movie brats like @entity51 and @entity100 , as well as @entity101 and @entity102			0
in person , he is a great raconteur and his expletive - littered speech is not a million miles away from the dialogue that 's so central to his movies			0
" i tend to think of myself as more of a novelist who makes movies than a director per se , " he declares			0
but he dismisses his apparent love of language as a product of writing for acting classes : " i started writing as an actor and it was all about dialogue and writing scenes to do			0
" before moving into directing , @entity5 studied acting for six years and says learning to act for the camera gave him an insight into how directors put a movie together -- frame by frame			1
that was what really taught him how to write for the movies			0
" all of a sudden i started seeing [ film ] in a whole different way			0
when you start doing that , then it 's only a few short steps until you start composing shots of your own , " he explains			0
@entity5 has shown himself to be one of the most music - savvy directors of this generation with his use of songs like " @entity143 " by the @entity144 in the opening sequence of " @entity17 " and @entity146 's " @entity147 " in " @entity148			1
" he , not immodestly , puts that skill down to his great music collection			0
" the thing is , i have one of the best soundtrack collections in @entity75 , " he boasts			0
that probably accounts for his scathing determination never to use film composers : " i do n't trust any composers to do it			0
i would just never give anybody that kind of responsibility , " he says , " who the f * * * is this guy coming in here , throwing their s * * * all over my movie ? " and he admits that his inner film buff enjoys the cornerstones of action cinema that some of his later movies have explored			2
" i love action scenes , but they are hard , and in a way that 's what 's fun about them			2
to me , action scenes are some of the most cinematic moments that you can do in film , " he says			0
" @entity185 " and " @entity186 , " starring @entity5 muse and @entity189 a-lister @entity188 , are his movie - geek nod to the kung fu genre			1
when he started filming " @entity190 , " @entity5 had n't made a film for six years and with typical chutzpah challenged himself to choreograph astonishingly intricate fight scenes			1
" if i throw my hat in the ring with the greatest action directors who ever lived ... i wan na be as good as them , " he asserts			0
he continues to work his way through his action movie checklist			0
in his latest movie , " @entity201 , " a homage to sleazy 70s b - movies that stars @entity204 as a murderous stuntman , he puts his own spin on another of action film 's fundamentals -- the car chase			1
@entity5 is critical of @entity211 being used so much in film today			1
all the seat - grippingly tense stunts in " @entity201 " are real and he specifically cast a stuntwoman , @entity214 , in one of the leading roles to achieve this			0
it may have been ambitious , but " @entity201 , " which is one half of " @entity220 , " a b - movie - referencing double bill he made with fellow director @entity219 , got a critical mauling and did n't fare much better at the box office			2
but then @entity5 has long been resigned to people either loving or hating his movies .			2

" @entity17 " and " @entity148 " director @entity5 talks about his films
@entity5 realised early in his career audiences would either love or hate his films
the movie geek 's second film " @entity7 " won the @entity85 at @entity73
on his style : " i 'm trying to get you to laugh at things you 've never laughed at before "
