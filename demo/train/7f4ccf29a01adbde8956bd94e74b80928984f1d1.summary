amid mounting allegations against him , @entity0 has broken his silence			1
@entity0 , accused of rape and other misdeeds by an increasing number of women , was reached at home on friday by a freelance reporter for the @entity9			1
while @entity0 offered @entity10 more than the head - shake that caused several moments of awkward radio silence during an interview with @entity15 , he did not address the allegations			1
instead , he offered his expectations for how the media -- specifically , " the black media " -- should cover the story			0
" let me say this , " the 77 - year - old said			0
" i only expect the black media to uphold the standards of excellence in journalism and when you do that , you have to go in with a neutral mind			0
" @entity29 says @entity0 drugged her @entity0 's reputation has suffered in the wake of the allegations			1
on monday , @entity33 reported that @entity34 , to which @entity0 and wife @entity35 donated $ 20 million in 1987 , has suspended the @entity0 chair for the @entity37 while the controversy continues			1
" the @entity42 and @entity41 was established to bring positive attention and accomplished visiting scholars to @entity34 in order to enhance our intellectual , cultural and creative life , " a school spokeswoman told the newspaper			2
" the current context prevents us from continuing to meet these objectives fully			0

" @entity0 himself cut ties with his beloved @entity57 , where he served on the board , two weeks ago			2
@entity0 attended @entity57 in the early ' 60s			2
despite @entity0 's challenges , @entity10 wrote that the comedian " sounded upbeat on the phone , " especially when it came to a question about how his wife , @entity35 , is holding up			1
" love and the strength of womanhood , " @entity0 said			2
" let me say it again , love and the strength of womanhood			0
and , you could reverse it , the strength of womanhood and love			0
" the actor then resumed his public relations posture of late and ended the conversation , saying , " they do n't want me talking to the media			0
" @entity10 also writes for the @entity77 , a newspaper targeted to the @entity80 - @entity79 community , and he spoke with @entity81 about their conversation			1
@entity10 said he came away with the clear sense that @entity0 actually does n't want to stay silent at all but is nevertheless deferring to the guidance of his representatives for the time being			1
" i definitely came away with the belief that he wants to talk about everything , " @entity10 said			2
" he seemed as if he really does have a lot to say and , oddly enough , he did n't in any way appear worried about anything			0
to me , he sounded like a happy individual without a care in the world			1
" as for how he sort of landed a sort of scoop , @entity10 said he had been keeping in touch with @entity0 's camp for the past three and a half weeks -- and at one point even thought he was close to securing an interview -- but when his people changed their minds , @entity10 did an end - around			1
