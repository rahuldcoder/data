-- every year the holidays bring cold weather , family gatherings , gift - giving , and of course , the perennial debate over the @entity7 and @entity8			0
recently , a @entity10 school district drew criticism following a performance that removed the holier lyrics from the traditional @entity8 song " @entity15			1
" some parents objected when the fifth - grade choir at the school in @entity19 , @entity20 , left out phrases such as " @entity22 "			1
the school superintendent said the principal and choir director removed the references to avoid " offense to people of other faith , " according to @entity30			1
but regardless of the reason , would it be legal for a school choir to perform " @entity15 " in its traditional form ? to enter the fray we have to understand some of the basics about the often - uncertain relationship between the @entity39 and public schools			1
first , let 's dispel the myths : the @entity39 does not ban all mention of any religion in public schools			1
as the @entity49 has noted , " total separation ( between church and state ) is not possible in an absolute sense			0
" after all , when our kids study world history , they are often studying religion			2
wars , civilizations , exploration , and human culture have always been motivated in part by some form of dogma			0
to filter religion out of history leaves something that can not , in good faith , still be called history			2
and while some @entity8 music consists of light - hearted fare , other pieces are authored by @entity69 or @entity70 , and have undeniable value in a musical curriculum			0
religion has always been a part of our civilization ; the @entity7 and our courts recognize this			1
instead , the @entity79 only prohibits the " advancement " or the " inhibition " of religion by the state			2
of course , that 's a distinction that 's much easier to describe than it is to identify in real life			0
when does a school cross the line into advancing or inhibiting religion ? in 1971 the @entity49 decided @entity90 and formulated the " @entity91 , " which is a three - pronged evaluation of the constitutionality of legislation concerning religion			1
a court will consider the following : 1			0
the government 's action must have a secular ( non-religious ) purpose			0
the government 's action can not have the principal or primary effect of ( a ) advancing religion , or ( b ) inhibiting religion			2
it would be impossible to develop a public school curriculum that did not in some way affect the religious or nonreligious sensibilities of some of the students or their parents			2
therefore , the test is not " any effect			0
" rather , the courts will look to the " principal or primary " effect			0
the government 's action can not " excessively entangle " itself with religion -- that is , it can not intrude into , participate in , or supervise religious affairs			0
so how does this apply to singing @entity8 carols in school ? fortunately , the courts have squarely dealt with that issue , in the context of ... you guessed it ... " @entity15			1
" in perhaps the first case to deal specifically with @entity8 music , an atheist father challenged the @entity129 , @entity130 , school board 's use of " @entity15 " ( and other songs ) in the school 's @entity8 program			1
the @entity136 -- one of the last stops before the @entity49 -- applied the @entity140 test in @entity141 v. @entity142 , and held that both the study and performance of religious songs , including @entity8 carols , are constitutional if their purpose is the " advancement of the students ' knowledge of society 's cultural and religious heritage , as well as the provision of an opportunity for students to perform a full range of music , poetry and drama that is likely to be of interest to the students and their audience			0
" the court also reiterated that : " it is unquestioned that public school students may be taught about the customs and cultural heritage of the @entity169 and other countries			0
" and that schools may " allow the presentation of material that , although of religious origin , has taken on an independent meaning			0
" after @entity141 , it appears that the @entity79 does not prevent the singing of @entity8 carols with religious origins by public school choirs , though the line seems very thin			1
for example , if instead of singing " @entity15 , " the kids were made to take a quiz testing them on the religious facts undergirding the song : q : in the song @entity15 , who is the " @entity22 " ? a : @entity22 ! then the school likely crosses into administration of religious training , which is the domain of family and church , not schools			1
if nothing else though , it certainly appears that " @entity15 , " though much more religious than " @entity196 , " or " @entity8 , " is a street - legal public school choir song			1
so it appears that schools may include even religious @entity8 carols in their curriculum without violating the @entity7			0
but , can a school go the other direction , and prohibit all @entity8 carols from the curriculum ? at least one federal court has held that they can			0
in @entity207 of @entity208 , @entity209 , the @entity206 held that a school district 's policy to bar performance of religious holiday music at seasonal shows , while allowing it to be taught in class , had a legitimate secular purpose of avoiding potential @entity79 problems , and was not " hostile " to religion			1
so schools appear to have broad discretion to include or prohibit @entity8 carols , as long as they do n't run afoul of the @entity140 test			1
navigating the constitutional perils of religion in school is not easy -- indeed , every year the holiday season brings with it an @entity79 debate			1
the courts and schools will continue to struggle with defining permissible non-secular content			2
at least there are some less contentious holiday traditions that we can always count on : egg nog , gift returns , and bad decisions at office parties			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity242 .			2

@entity242 : a @entity244 *edited* lyrics of " @entity15 "
he says courts have *delved* into issue of singing @entity250 in schools
@entity39 does n't bar all religion from schools , but courts have set *guidelines* , he says
@entity242 : " @entity15 " is fine for a school choir in most cases
