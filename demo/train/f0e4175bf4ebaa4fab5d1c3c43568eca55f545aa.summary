the @entity1 administration has taken another step in its effort to combat rape on college campuses with the release of a new report			1
the @entity8 to protect students from @entity10 produced the 20 - page report			1
the task force , including attorney general @entity13 and secretary of education @entity14 , spent the last three months talking to " thousands of people " and compiled a number of very specific recommendations : more data : the task force wants to know more about the scope and scale of the problem			1
the report cites a statistic from the @entity26 that one in five women experience rape or attempted rape in college but say the group needs to know more			1
this year , the task force is pushing schools to use its tool kit in 2015 to survey their campuses			1
by 2016 , the task force will be reporting			1
the report said " we will explore legislative or administrative options to require the schools to conduct a survey			2
" survivors need more : in 2011 , the administration first alerted schools about their responsibilities to survivors of sexual violence			0
the administration said that under @entity50 schools had to address sexual violence in order to provide equal access to education			1
but schools have struggled with that			0
in the past three years many have been publicly cited for failing to live up to these standards			0
most recently , the @entity58 announced that @entity62 " failed to comply with @entity50 " in the way it handles sexual assaults			1
the school wrote it was " surprised and disappointed " with the finding , adding it was " deeply committed to the safety and well - being of our students			0
" so now the administration is getting more specific			0
the importance of having confidential advocates is now emphasized			0
this point clarifies what had been confusing for many , namely that not everyone on college campuses has a duty to report			1
" in recent years , some schools have directed nearly all their employees ... to report all the details of an incident to school officials , " the report said , " which can mean a survivor quickly loses control over what happens next			0
" that 's a critical issue for many advocates who emphasize the importance of returning control to survivors			1
the administration calls for further training for those who deal with sexual violence on college campuses			1
" insensitive or judgmental comments -- or questions that focus on a victim 's behavior ( e.g. , what she was wearing , her prior sexual history ) rather than on the alleged perpetrator 's -- can compound a victim 's distress , " the report notes			2
on the enforcement side , the report calls for new models for investigating and adjudicating cases on campus and for a pilot program aimed at rehabilitating offenders			2
tuesday , the @entity8 unveiled a new public service announcement encouraging men to help women who are in danger of being sexually assaulted			2
the @entity116 features several @entity118 stars , including @entity119 and @entity120 and will air in movie theaters beginning in may			0
transparency : one of the biggest problems with sexual violence on college campuses is that no college wants to admit it has a problem			1
parents do n't want to send their children to a school where data shows more sexual crimes occur , that could ding rankings and potentially cause problems with donors			0
paradoxically , advocates say , those schools that have high numbers may actually be taking the problem seriously			0
that 's because they have robust systems in place that allow for students to file complaints			0
now the government wants to centralize all that data on @entity149			0
accountability : it wo n't just be numbers on @entity149			0
the administration will also put forms online making it easier for students to complain if their school fails to live up to the other obligations			0
many of the @entity160 and @entity58 investigations over the years have resulted from student complaints			0
so what does this all mean ? according to know your ix , an organization that seeks to educate college students about @entity50 rights , it 's a good step , but more is needed			1
" these changes will mean little until @entity50 enforcement is finally given teeth , " the organization said			2
know your ix said the administration is reluctant to use the best leverage it currently has , namely pulling a school 's federal funding			2
" the agency has never once sanctioned a school for sexual violence - related violations of @entity50 , " the organization said			1
students accuse @entity185 of mishandling sexual assault complaints student activists fight to end rape on campus teens trained to spot drama before it turns dangerous			2
