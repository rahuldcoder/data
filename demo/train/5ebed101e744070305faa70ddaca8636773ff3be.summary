this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity17 , @entity18 : you can beware the @entity20 , but there 's nothing to fear about today 's broadcast of @entity0			1
reporting from the @entity25 , i 'm @entity26			1
first up : health care push @entity28 : first up , president @entity29 postpones a trip overseas so that he can stay in @entity10 and work on health care			1
he 's called it the top priority for the @entity34 , and the president , along with @entity38 leaders in @entity39 , all think it 's important for him to stay in the @entity34 to help rally support for the health care reform bill being considered by lawmakers			1
a @entity45 committee is scheduled to hold a vote on it today			1
@entity48 are against president @entity29 's health care plan			1
some want to scrap it and start over			1
yesterday , on @entity0 's " @entity53 " with @entity54 , a top @entity48 in @entity39 talked about why a health care bill has n't passed yet , and president @entity29 's top political adviser discussed why it might pass now			1
@entity58 @entity57 , ( r ) minority leader : they tried to do this in june and july last year			1
if they had the votes , then it would be law			1
they tried to pass it in september , october , november , december , january , february			1
guess what ? they do n't have the votes			1
the @entity34 people do n't want to take the step toward government - run health insurance			1
it 's a dangerous step , because we do have the best health care system in the world			1
@entity78 , @entity80 senior adviser : we 're very optimistic about the outcome of this process			1
i think people have come to the realization that this is the moment , and if we do n't act now , there 'll be dire consequences for people all over this country			1
@entity91 @entity28 : heading up the coast to the northeastern @entity34 now , where some areas are recovering from severe storms over the weekend			1
and we mean huge storms			1
@entity5 , @entity4 , @entity7 , @entity6 : all of them hit with heavy rains and hurricane force winds gusting over 70 miles per hour			2
the storms knocked down trees , affected air travel , left more than half a million people without power			2
one official said part of the reason the trees and utility poles fell over is because the ground was so wet from all the snow that the region 's been hit with this winter			1
the force of nature also being felt on the other side of @entity118			2
an avalanche struck a snowmobile competition in @entity8 , @entity9 on saturday			2
as of yesterday afternoon , authorities said two people had been killed and 30 others were injured			2
@entity124 @entity28 : the @entity124 is on its way back home after spending nearly two months helping out earthquake victims in @entity128			2
the @entity130 hospital ship is expected to arrive at its home pier in @entity132 , @entity133 by the end of this week			2
saturday , the @entity124 pulled in to @entity135 , @entity136			2
it had been in the harbor of @entity139 since january , a base for medical care for victims of the catastrophic quake that hit @entity128			2
staff on the @entity124 performed more than 800 surgeries during the mission			2
there were times when 10 different operating rooms on the ship were all running simultaneously			2
female @entity151 @entity28 : @entity153 , whom you see right here , is a science teacher at @entity156 in @entity158 teacher , though , is not her only title			2
@entity160 is the school 's new , head varsity football coach			1
she 's been an assistant coach at other schools and she 's played women 's professional football			1
it is extremely rare for a high school football team to have a female coach , and some women 's groups are calling this announcement historic			1
@entity160 says history is not her focus			2
@entity153 , @entity174 head football coach : some people will undoubtedly want to focus on my gender , and they 'll focus on the historical meaning of this day			1
but i would much rather focus on something that all dedicated coaches already know : i 'm here to give these young men , these student athletes , these wonderful students , the best opportunity and guidance to succeed in the classroom , make good decisions at home , and perform well on the football field			1
and while i 'm proud to be part of what this all means , being female has nothing to do with it			2

where does this passion come from ? @entity286 , @entity300 calculus teacher : you know , i think i have always enjoyed teaching			0

it all started a few years ago when a cousin wanted some online math tutoring			0
pretty soon , other relatives started asking for similar help			0
suddenly , people he did n't know started watching			0
it is now called the @entity311			0
the videos are short and simply produced ; only his voice with a simple black background and graphics			0
@entity311 : there are a lot of people who need help with their math , science , whatever			0
and i think they find these @entity300 videos as kind of the ideal nuggets to fill in their gaps			0
@entity304 : whatever you call him or his teachings , the success of his site has validated that decision to walk away from hedge funds			0
@entity281 , @entity0 , @entity285			0
( @entity412 ) @entity413 @entity28 : the @entity414 is going green ! it has nothing to do with envy or the environment			0
