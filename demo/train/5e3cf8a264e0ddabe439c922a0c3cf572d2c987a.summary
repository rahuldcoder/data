-- when the players line up on the field for the crucial @entity6 - @entity5 match on thursday , fans may see @entity8 's lips moving during both countries ' national anthems			1
@entity8 coached the @entity12 national team in the 2006 @entity13			1
eight years later , he 's coaching @entity14			2
in the run - up to the @entity16 , @entity8 rubbed @entity6 soccer fans the wrong way with his frank early assessment that the team was n't ready to win the championship			1
he irked others when he brought on five @entity12 - born players while dropping @entity24 , @entity14 's all - time highest scorer			0
but the team 's successes under @entity8 this year have silenced the grumbling , as they have fought their way through initial play in @entity30 against competitors with a reputation for being so tough that it has been nicknamed the " @entity34			2
" if the @entity6 pulls through to the next round thursday , it will be as much due to the dogged determination of the players on the field as @entity8 's coaching skills off it			1
a national hero outside of the @entity6 , @entity8 is very well - known			1
in @entity5 , he 's a household name , one of its brightest football stars			1
he likes to tell his life 's story from the start			0
" i grew up in a family bakery where i saw my dad working long hours every day -- 12 , 14 , sometimes 16 hours -- and he barely could get sleep , " @entity8 said			2
that work ethic is in his dna , he said			0
and he stuck it into soccer at the earliest , signing his first pro contract at age 16			2
by age 24 , he became the top scorer in the @entity12 premiere league , the @entity61 , and was celebrated as player of the year			0
two years later , in 1990 , he played on the @entity12 national team , when it took its third @entity13 trophy			1
@entity8 also played in the professional leagues of @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69			0
in 1998 , he retired from play and moved to @entity71 with his @entity6 wife , @entity72 , whom he met , while she was working abroad in @entity73			1
eight years later , @entity8 practically became a national hero in his native @entity5 as its team 's head coach , when the country hosted the 2006 @entity13			1
he changed the way @entity5 played the game , teaching them to shed their conservative defense - minded approach for an aggressive offensive one			1
though he did not lead the team to the top prize -- they came in third -- something even more wonderful happened : @entity5 shed a layer of its dark historic burden			1
feeling despised for @entity5 's ruthlessness in @entity94 , flag - waving patriotism was a taboo for @entity12			1
during the cup , global adoration poured in on them , and they broke out the flags to celebrate			0
@entity8 stood in the center of it all			0
millions thanked him for his leadership			0
fan crowds were dotted with signs reading : " @entity107 , @entity8 ! " a master psychologist the @entity6 coach 's style -- and his main strength -- could be summed up in one word : psychology			1
players seem to connect with him			0
they describe him as personable , easy to talk to			0
he rallies and motivates them ; he irons out ego conflicts , analysts have said			0
tensions over @entity12 - born players existed on the @entity6 national team long before @entity8 took the top coaching job in 2011 , said @entity125 analyst @entity124			1
it fractured the locker room			0
@entity8 seems to have changed that , and players have become greatly committed to the team			2
team spirit has long been his strength , said @entity0 sports reporter @entity133			2
" it 's not a team full of superstars , " @entity133 said			2
" it 's a team that never knows when it 's beaten			2
" @entity8 also handles the public well , @entity133 said			0
his candor about @entity14 's readiness served to downplay expectations			0
he is a pro at controlling narratives , deflecting media hype away from players and onto himself			0
" i think he is a very shrewd manipulator of the media , " @entity133 said			0
meet the team @entity14 players with ties to @entity5 the hero 's shadow " that bugs me , " analyst @entity124 said			1
he feels like @entity8 has contributed to media narratives he has grown tired of : the @entity6 team is @entity156 ; @entity5 is @entity157			1
" he 's not the savior , and we do n't need saving , " @entity124 said			0
the team improved greatly in the 10 - plus years before @entity8 came along , and the new coach is building on that success , he believes			1
the @entity6 has shined in international tournaments , coming in first and second			1
it spent a decade fighting to get the upper hand on the formidable @entity167 national team			1
and it has beaten the @entity67 team in @entity67			2
for all his real strengths , @entity8 has some weaknesses , too , @entity124 said			0
some of his stints coaching professional teams have proved lackluster			2
in @entity5 , @entity8 has come under fire from current national team captain @entity176 , who has said the current @entity6 coach lacks tactical finesse			1
and he has left some vulnerabilities in @entity6 team 's lineup , when he had better alternatives at hand , @entity124 said			1
" a guy like @entity24 gets left at home			0
that frustrates me , " he said			0
the team has also made a serious consistent error			2
" four games in a row now after the 80th minute , we have given up a goal , " he said			0
in his eyes , @entity8 is no better than his recent predecessors -- unless he beats @entity5 on thursday			1
do that , and all is forgiven			0
the moment of truth the strengths of @entity5 's coach , @entity200 , fall right where @entity8 's weaknesses lie			1
he is the master tactician and technician			0
the two once made a great team -- they balanced each other out , when @entity200 worked under @entity8 in 2006			1
and they have become the closest of friends			0
standing across from him , his former team and his native country will feel strange			2
" facing @entity5 , obviously , for me personally will be a very emotional situation , " he said			1
" having both anthems play before the game , looking at their bench			1
" the @entity12 press has reported that he will sing along with them			2
he has already taken a beating from disillusioned journalists there for singing " @entity220			0
" " coach @entity8 obviously sings every national anthem , " wrote one @entity12 news website			1
once that 's over , then it 's game on , @entity124 said			2
he has no doubts @entity8 will do anything to win			0
" he 's a fierce and ruthless competitor			0
" " we have been waiting for this game quite a long time , " @entity8 said			2
" it 's massive , there 's no other word to say			0
" and he has changed the narrative of the @entity6 team : " we are by no means any underdog here			1
" @entity0 's @entity235 and @entity236 contributed to this report			0

in the game against @entity5 , the @entity6 coach may sing both national anthems
he is more than a soccer star in @entity5 -- practically a national hero
he is known as a great team builder and motivator
but tactic and technique could be a weakness , and he has had some coaching *failures*
