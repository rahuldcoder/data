-- the @entity1 has broadened its travel warning for @entity3 , advising citizens to avoid certain areas and steer clear of driving at night			1
the new alert , issued late last week , urges @entity7 to defer nonessential travel in regions where drug - related violence has surged , including the border state of @entity12 and the central state of @entity14			1
it also warns against nonessential travel in parts of eight other states , significantly expanding the scope of an alert issued in september			1
" there 's pretty much no state that has n't been touched by this			0
... we 've seen some major , high - value cartel targets that have been taken down by the @entity3 government , but that does n't appear to have quelled a lot of the violence , " said @entity24 , vice president of the @entity26 global intelligence agency			1
" we see no short - term end in sight			1
" the @entity1 notes that millions of @entity7 citizens safely visit @entity3 every year			1
but it also says @entity3 's ongoing violence and security concerns pose " serious risks " for @entity7 citizens , and urges travelers to take precautions			1
" to reduce risk , you are strongly urged to travel only during daylight hours throughout @entity3 , to avoid isolated roads and to use toll roads whenever possible , " the advisory says			2
@entity7 with connections to @entity3 had mixed reactions to the latest assessment of travel south of the border			1
friday 's warning was " a major red flag " and " quite a bit more expansive " than past alerts , said @entity55 , vice president for global education at @entity56			1
" we do n't have armored cars like the government does , " said @entity55 , who noted that school officials will meet this week to discuss how the new guidelines might affect study - abroad trips			0
but reports of violence can be overblown , the leader of an expatriate group in @entity3 said , describing his trip last month to a butterfly sanctuary in @entity14 , a stronghold of @entity3 's @entity70 cartel			2
" i felt totally safe there			0
we had no problem at all			0
you have to be mindful of what 's going on , but there are n't people attacking anybody , especially expats , " @entity73 said			0
the 69 - year - old retired small - business owner from @entity81 , @entity82 , heads the @entity83 , an expatriate community center in the @entity3 state of @entity86 with more than 3,000 members			2
the country remains a " great place to retire , " he said , despite security concerns			0
the people that live here do not live in fear of moving around freely			2
we 're just , perhaps , more cautious , " he said			0
@entity3 's government has not issued an official response to the latest @entity7 alert			1
tourism officials have repeatedly stressed that violence occurs mostly in areas along the border that are far from @entity3 's popular landmarks and beaches			2
" we should not take the issue out of context , " @entity107 , chief operating officer of the @entity108 , said in a recent interview			0
" the distances are very , very great			0
you would n't stop going to @entity114 because of a problem in @entity116			0
" but @entity24 , of @entity26 , said the latest @entity1 alert shows " the unpredictability of where this violence could happen next			2
" " the fear is that as you are traveling the highways inside @entity3 , that you could be victimized in some sort of roving roadblock , " he said			2
blocking major thoroughfares to prevent police and military reinforcements from arriving has become an increasingly common tactic employed by drug gangs across @entity3			1
the @entity1 advisory warns of carjacking and highway robberies and notes , " violence along @entity3 roads and highways is a particular concern in the northern border region			1
" drug cartel members blocked roads with hijacked vehicles in the border states of @entity144 and @entity12 over two days in march			0
during clashes with federal police in december , suspected members of @entity70 set trucks and buses ablaze on highways in @entity14			0
@entity3 government figures indicate more than 34,600 people have been killed in drug - related violence in @entity3 since president @entity154 announced a crackdown on cartels in december 2006			1
the number of @entity7 citizens killed in @entity3 increased from 35 in 2007 to 111 in 2010 , the @entity1 said			1
more than a third of the 2010 reported slayings of @entity7 citizens occurred in the border cities of @entity163 and @entity164 , according to the @entity1			1
" there is no evidence that @entity7 tourists have been targeted by criminal elements due to their citizenship			0
nonetheless , while in @entity3 you should be aware of your surroundings at all times and exercise particular caution in unfamiliar areas , " the alert says			2
friday 's warning also specifies dangers and advises against nonessential travel in parts of the states of @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity86 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187			0
travelers should exercise caution visiting parts of @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity144 , the advisory says			0
@entity0 's @entity194 contributed to this report .			0
