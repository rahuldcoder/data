@entity0 -- another brick is falling from the @entity5 administration 's highly touted " virtual wall " that was intended to keep illegal immigrants from entering the @entity7			0
homeland security secretary @entity8 said tuesday she will take $ 50 million in federal stimulus money away from the @entity10 , also known as @entity11 , and spend it on proven , off - the - shelf technology to protect @entity7 borders			1
as originally envisioned , @entity11 was to give the @entity7 control of its borders through a system of movable surveillance towers , high - tech sensors , radars , cameras and communication relays that would give @entity25 agents the ability to see and respond to intruders			1
but the system , which is being developed by @entity29 , has come under withering criticism from the @entity31 and others who say that it has been riddled with problems			0
@entity35 said the @entity11 has been " plagued with cost overruns and missed deadlines			1
" she said she is freezing all other @entity11 funding beyond money being spent on a 53 - mile stretch of border in @entity43 until a re-assessment of the project she ordered in january is completed			2
" not only do we have an obligation to secure our borders , we have a responsibility to do so in the most cost effective way possible , " @entity35 said in a statement			2
last year , @entity35 announced that $ 50 million in stimulus funding would be spent to accelerate deployment of @entity11 's surveillance technology and associated command and control technologies			1
but a homeland security official said @entity60 is opting to reallocate the money to something the department believes will be more effective at providing border security			0
@entity35 said tuesday the money will be spent on commercially available technology , including mobile surveillance , thermal imaging devices , ultra-light detection , backscatter ( full body image ) units , mobile radios , cameras and laptops for pursuit vehicles and remote video surveillance system enhancements			2
rep. @entity77 , @entity78 , chairman of the @entity79 , said @entity11 has been a " grave and expensive disappointment			0
" " today 's announcement is recognition that this troubled program needs better management and stronger oversight , " he said tuesday .			0

@entity10 funds will be *diverted* to proven technology
@entity11 was intended to help @entity25 agents respond to intruders
@entity35 says @entity11 has been " plagued with cost overruns and missed deadlines "
