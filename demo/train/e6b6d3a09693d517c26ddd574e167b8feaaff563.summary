-- four months after @entity3 gov. @entity2 signed a new law banning " upskirting , " police have made their first arrest			1
@entity7 , 23 , was the first person in the state to be charged under the new law , according to @entity9 , spokesman for the @entity10 ( @entity10 )			2
@entity10 police were called to the @entity13 @entity10 station in @entity14 , a neighborhood of @entity15 , on tuesday afternoon for a report of a man taking photos up a woman 's dress , according to @entity10 police			1
when police arrived they questioned the 26 - year - old victim who told officers that while she was standing in the upper busway she felt " something " brush against her knees			2
when she looked down she saw a man 's hand " between her legs , holding an @entity33 with the camera on facing up her skirt , " according to police			1
the victim provided a detailed description of the suspect , including turning the table on the man by taking photos of him as he walked away , according to a statement from the @entity44 district attorney 's office			1
police found @entity7 on a bus shortly after and questioned him			2
he admitted to the deed , according to police , and stated to officers he had previously heard on the news it was not illegal to " take pictures up a girl 's skirt			1
" five months ago , @entity7 would have been right			0
criminalizing " upskirting " stemmed from a case against @entity55 , 32 , who was arrested in 2010 for allegedly taking photos up an undercover officer 's dress , according to court documents			1
the charges against him were eventually dropped because @entity3 ' highest court ruled that @entity55 did not violate state law when he took photos up the skirt of a woman because she was not nude or partially nude , as stipulated by an old state law against secretive photography			1
intense media scrutiny followed and state lawmakers quickly called for a revision to the statute			0
they passed a bill making " upskirting " illegal and the governor signed it into law on march 7			2
so what is " upskirting " ? it is the " secret photographing , videotaping , or electronic surveillance of another person 's sexual or other intimate parts , whether under or around a person 's clothing or when a reasonable person would believe that the person 's intimate parts would not be visible to the public , " @entity2 's office said in a prepared statement in march			1
@entity7 pleaded not guilty on wednesday to violating the " upskirting " law and ordered held on $ 150 bail			0
he was also ordered to stay away from @entity10 property , including buses and trains			0
if convicted , @entity95 could face a sentence of @entity97 to 5 years and up to a $ 5,000 fine			0
after wednesday 's court proceeding , @entity7 ' attorney , @entity99 , spoke briefly to @entity0 affiliate @entity101			0
" i believe in the police report it was quoted that he ( @entity7 ) had either heard on the news or read online that this was not illegal , but ... i have n't really gotten into detail with him about that , " @entity99 said			0
@entity0 's @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 contributed to this report .			0

" @entity116 " involves secretly recording or photographing another 's intimate areas in public
@entity3 ' law stems from a 2010 arrest of a man taking photos up a woman 's dress
the woman was an undercover police officer
but those charges were dropped because of *wording* in the law at the time
