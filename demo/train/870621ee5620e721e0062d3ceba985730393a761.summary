@entity0 -- to @entity5 sen. @entity4 , @entity3 president @entity2 invaded @entity6 because the @entity7 failed to avenge the 2012 terrorist attack that killed four @entity7 in @entity9 , @entity10			1
" it started with @entity9 , " @entity4 posted tuesday on @entity11			0
" when you kill @entity7 and nobody pays a price , you invite this type of aggression			0
" nonsense , said @entity18 strategist and @entity1 political contributor @entity17			1
" the whole notion that this is all about the @entity7 or all about president @entity22 , it 's frankly silly , " @entity17 said wednesday on @entity1 's " @entity23			0
" such is the state of political discourse these days in the @entity7 , where every issue -- particularly one that dominates media headlines -- becomes fair game for partisan attack			1
election year rhetoric the dynamic is especially acute in an election year , when candidates and parties seek to score points with voters , and magnified even more when it involves foreign policy , noted @entity39 , the vice president for governance studies at the @entity40			1
" it does n't matter what happens -- republicans attack and @entity18 sound defensive , " @entity39 told @entity1 on wednesday			1
" it 's easy to do in foreign policy because there are so many unexpected things that take place			1
every month there 's going to be a crisis			0
we just do n't know where			0
" @entity53 resolution urges sanctions against @entity3 regardless of what started the events that led to @entity3 's incursion into @entity6 's @entity59 last week , both sides have adopted postures now familiar to @entity7 already disgusted with the political dysfunction permeating @entity0			1
" can you think of any place in the world , any place where we are better off now than we were when he came to office ? " @entity70 @entity5 leader @entity69 said wednesday of president @entity22			1
" he has acted in such a way almost amounting to passivity in many instances			0
" concerned about being labeled a war - monger , @entity75 quickly made clear that " we are not suggesting here that the use of force is appropriate in very many occasions			2
" " only occasionally , " he said			0
" but there is a widespread kind of lack of respect for @entity7 opinion			0
" partisan divide to former @entity89 and @entity91 chairman @entity90 , @entity22 " is doing exactly the right thing " with a measured approach to the @entity6 crisis			1
" he 's ratcheting up the heat , and he 's doing it slowly enough so that @entity2 has a chance to back off , " @entity90 said tuesday on @entity1 's " @entity94			2
" " one problem with @entity2 is not only has he broken the law , but he now has to back down and save face at the same time			2
he needs the opportunity to do that			0
so the president needs to tighten the vise , keep squeezing gently , carefully , and not making it so public			0
and i think he 's doing exactly that , " @entity90 said			0
does @entity2 want a new @entity107 ? most striking about the back - and - forth is that deep down , the two sides generally agree on what should happen			1
no one wants a military confrontation involving @entity7 forces , instead preferring steps to isolate @entity3 diplomatically and economically			0
ideas include a threatened boycott of the upcoming @entity116 in @entity117 , with hints of kicking @entity3 out of the group of industrial powers that includes the @entity7 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126			0
also under consideration are strong economic sanctions , perhaps targeting @entity3 's state - owned banks or wealthy oligarchs who keep and spend much of their money abroad			2
the @entity7 has halted some military cooperation as well			0
tough races mean tough attacks the venom of political dialogue generally depends on the toughness of the electoral challenge facing a particular candidate			2
@entity4 and @entity75 both have conservative primary rivals in traditionally red states of @entity142 and @entity143 , and therefore want to sound belligerent against anything involving @entity22 and @entity18			1
compare their rhetoric to rep. @entity147 of @entity148 , the @entity5 vice-presidential nominee in 2012 who remains open to a presidential run in 2016			1
with his re-election presumably as safe as can be , @entity147 touched on the main points of responses from both sides to the @entity6 crisis			2
@entity147 : @entity155 invited aggression but taking right steps " when you have the world superpower having a foreign policy that , in my opinion , is weak and a defense policy now that shows weakness , i think it invites aggression			1
i think that it creates a vacuum that is filled by these types of actions , " @entity147 told @entity1 on wednesday			0
" but , let 's be really clear			0
who is to blame for this ? @entity2 is to blame for this			0
and , i think the administration is making the proper responses			0
" @entity5 group ties @entity176 to @entity22 handling on @entity6 to @entity39 , @entity5 " always love to make @entity22 look weak on foreign policy			1
" " it 's easy to say that the president was caught off guard , " @entity39 said in a telephone interview			0
" he was caught off guard , but so was every expert in the country			0
i do n't think anybody anticipated that first there would be the overturning of the government in the @entity6 , and then the @entity3 response after that			2
" he called the knee - jerk criticism " a way for people to take advantage of the international uncertainty to score political points , " adding that " political responses are heightened because we 're facing a midterm election			2
" hawks oppose defense cuts @entity4 clearly had the 2016 presidential vote in mind when he linked @entity9 to @entity6			1
former secretary of state @entity204 is the overwhelming @entity18 favorite if she runs , and @entity4 and other @entity5 want to keep the terror attack in @entity10 on her watch fresh in the minds of voters			1
@entity39 , did you really expect @entity3 to ignore @entity6 chaos ? he also is among a group of hawkish @entity70 veterans trying to minimize or even reverse cuts to defense spending in recent years , hastened in part by @entity5 insistence on reduced government spending			1
" a lot of the current discussion is taking place against the backdrop of a conflict over defense spending , " @entity39 noted			1
" @entity22 's budget wants to scale back defense spending , and @entity5 are upset with that			1
it 's easy for them to use @entity6 as an example for not cutting the military			2
" @entity7 strategy for @entity6 crisis : money talks @entity176 compares @entity2 's @entity6 moves to @entity234 , later recalibrates @entity2 vs. @entity22 : facing off over facts in @entity6 @entity1 's @entity236 contributed to this report .			2

foreign policy issues such as @entity6 prompt tough election - year rhetoric
*analyst* : " republicans attack and @entity18 sound defensive "
despite the point - scoring , both parties generally back the same approach
@entity5 hawks use any issue to argue for halting or reversing cuts to defense spending
