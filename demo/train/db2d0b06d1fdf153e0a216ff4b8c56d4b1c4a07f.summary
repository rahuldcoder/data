-- in @entity1 , one could coin a new term for black bears : pets			1
some have gotten into the habit , it seems , of visiting neighborhoods there , and on thursday , one was caught literally hanging around -- in a @entity13 man 's hammock			1
" he got in the hammock like he was a tourist or something , " homeowner @entity14 told @entity0 affiliate wesh			1
usually , @entity14 is the one lounging on his back in the white rope mesh hanging between two trees			2
the bear enjoyed the respite enough to savor it			0
he -- or she -- stayed in the hammock for about 20 minutes , said photographer @entity26 , who snapped pictures of the bear from 60 feet away			1
@entity30 ' presence did not seem to disturb the wild animal 's repose			0
residents say the bear has been scrounging for food in the neighborhood since wednesday , ripping through garbage cans and knocking down bird feeders			0
aw , is n't that cute ? @entity26 and @entity14 may have enjoyed the visit by the large , furry character lumbering among the ranks of chirping birds and foraging squirrels on their lawns , but other @entity45 have n't shared their glee			2
in april , a black bear attacked a woman in her garage and dragged her out onto the driveway			1
she claimed it was a posse of five bears that roughed her up , but authorities said it was only one			0
but there was a handful of black bears roaming the neighborhood at the time of the attack , they said			2
do n't feed the bears ! wildlife officials also discourage the warm , fuzzy feeling some residents have for the black bears , pointing to the dangers they pose			1
wildlife law enforcement officers arrested an 81 - year - old woman from @entity70 in february for feeding loads of dog food to bears on her property			2
she dished out up to 18 bowls at a time to furry bunches gathered in her yard			0
the @entity79 warned her multiple times to stop , but she would not , for fear the animals would starve without her			0
officers were afraid the bears would get hazardously close to humans , and they killed one bear that was frequenting her feedings			1
once a bear feels too at home among people , relocating it does n't help , the @entity79 said back then			0
it will keep coming back .			0
