-- a new movie portraying their rise to the top of the tennis world will debut next month , but the @entity6 sisters are already giving it their best promotion after setting up their first head - to - head clash since 2009			1
both won two matches at the @entity13 event in @entity14 and will meet in the semifinals , with @entity16 hoping to defend her title and @entity18 battling to regain her status after longterm health problems			1
@entity16 triumphed 6 - 4 6 - 2 against fellow @entity22 @entity21 in their third - round match , with the world no. 1 setting up a rematch of last year 's final against @entity27 lucie safarova -- which she then won 6 - 4 6 - 1			1
her older sibling @entity18 was already through to the last four , having battled to defeat @entity22 12th seed @entity31 6 - 2 4 - 6 6 - 2 before cruising to a 6 - 4 6 - 4 win over 18 - year - old compatriot @entity33			2
it will be only the third time they have met on clay , and the first time on the latterly green surface of this @entity40 tournament -- which dates back to the beginning of the @entity42 in 1973 and is the oldest women 's professional event			2
" it was really motivating to see @entity18 win today -- i figured if she can win two matches , i have no excuse not to win my two matches , " @entity16 said			0
" @entity18 is the toughest opponent i 've ever played			0
i think she 's beaten me the most out of any player			0
i know her game and she knows my game			0
" i know her patterns , she knows mine -- she probably knows mine better than i do			0
i think it 'll be a great match tomorrow			0
" while @entity16 has bounced back from blood clots on her lungs after a freak foot injury suffered in 2010 , @entity18 has dropped to 24th in the rankings as she struggles to overcome the autoimmune disease @entity62 's syndrome			0
the 32 - year - old trails her sister 13 - 10 in career meetings , and lost their last one at the 2009 end - of - season @entity66			0
" i 've seen her so many times -- hopefully all the times i 've sat in those stands watching her will give me a little help , " said @entity18 , who won the 40 - year - old tournament back in 2004			0
" i 'm looking forward to it			0
last year in @entity75 i fell short and i did n't hold up my end of the bargain and make the semifinals , so i 'm glad i took it a step further this year			2
" they were joined in the last four by @entity82 , who like the @entity6 sisters has topped the rankings -- but without winning a grand slam			1

meanwhile , @entity92 gave @entity87 the perfect start to the @entity95 quarterfinal against the @entity22 as the world 's no. 1 men 's player defeated @entity99 in friday 's opening rubber in @entity101			1
the big - serving @entity22 had hopes of repeating last year 's win over @entity104 champion @entity92 in the @entity106 event at @entity107 , but was unable to take advantage of the high - altitude conditions in @entity110 as he went down 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) 6 - 2 7 - 5			1
@entity92 also prevailed when they met in the first round of the @entity95 three years ago , as his country went on to win the title for the first time			2
the @entity87 ' hopes of going through to the last four may rest on @entity118 , who was beaten in five sets by @entity22 no. 1 @entity120 in the second singles rubber after being asked to replace the injured world no. 10 @entity122			1
@entity120 won their 2010 encounter -- a dead rubber as the @entity87 had already won through -- and this time came back from 2 - 1 down to triumph 7 - 6 ( 7 - 1 ) 3 - 6 4 - 6 6 - 1 6 - 4 and level the score			1
the winner of this tie will next face either @entity89 or @entity131 , who were also 1 - 1 in @entity133			1
@entity134 gave @entity131 an early lead as he came from two sets down against @entity137 to win 5 - 7 4 - 6 6 - 4 6 - 3 6 - 3 in three hours and 15 minutes , but @entity89 no. 1 @entity138 beat @entity139 6 - 4 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) 7 - 5			2
@entity95 titleholder the @entity27 took a commanding 2 - 0 lead away to @entity141			1

the @entity27 can wrap up the best - of - five tie in saturday 's doubles rubber , which would set up a match with either @entity152 or @entity153			0
that quarterfinal was tied 1 - 1 after the opening day in @entity156 , as world @entity157 battled to overcome 71st - ranked @entity159 4 - 6 6 - 2 6 - 3 5 - 7 6 - 2 in the opening match			1
world no. 19 @entity164 , @entity153 's no. 1 in the absence of @entity163 , gave his country a lifeline by beating 13th - ranked @entity168 7 - 6 ( 7 - 2 ) 6 - 2 6 - 4 on the red clay .			0
