@entity1 vice president @entity0 will visit @entity2 and @entity3 this week as a dispute seethes over @entity6 's recent claim of a large swath of airspace in the region			1
the @entity3 declaration less than two weeks ago has prompted a war of words between governments and flights through the contested air zone by military planes from the @entity1 , @entity3 , @entity2 and @entity17			1
the uneasy situation in the sky over the @entity20 has raised fears that a midair incident could cause circumstances to spiral out of control			0
it has also fueled concern about how far @entity3 is willing to go to pursue its interests in the @entity9 and push back against @entity1 influence			0
" whatever @entity6 's motives in declaring the zone , it will add to the growing international tide of suspicion and sometimes even outright hostility as @entity3 increasingly asserts its growing power , " @entity33 , a geopolitical analyst , wrote in a commentary for @entity35 this week			0
@entity1 officials say that during his visit this week , @entity0 will raise @entity1 concerns about @entity6 's newly declared air defense identification zone -- which the @entity1 and @entity2 reject -- and encourage dialogue among countries in the region to ease tensions			1
he will also " make the broader point that there is an emerging pattern of behavior by @entity3 that is unsettling to @entity3 's own neighbors , " a senior @entity47 administration official said in a briefing last week			0
@entity55 spokeswoman @entity54 reiterated monday that @entity56 does n't recognize the air defense zone nor @entity3 's demand to be notified of plans by jets from other nations to fly into the area			1
@entity54 said the @entity1 position is separate from any @entity1 - based airlines ' decisions to comply with @entity3 's demands			2
reassuring an ally @entity0 will begin his @entity9 trip in @entity2 , the @entity1 ally that is locked in the most direct confrontation with @entity3 and plans to beef up its military			1
@entity73 and @entity6 's bitter dispute over a set of small , uninhabited islands in the @entity20 has already led to frequent tense encounters between the two sides ' ships and planes over the past year			0
now , @entity3 's new air defense zone overlaps significantly with that of @entity2 and encompasses the disputed islands			1
@entity3 is asking aircraft entering its air defense zone to identify themselves and submit flight plans			2
@entity2 has told its airlines not to comply with the new @entity3 demands , but the @entity1 government has urged @entity1 carriers to follow @entity6 's instructions			2
after arriving in @entity73 late monday , @entity0 is scheduled to meet tuesday with @entity2 prime minister @entity91 , who is likely to want reassurances of @entity1 commitment to standing firm against @entity3 's air zone claims			1
the @entity1 has thousands of troops stationed in @entity2 , and @entity1 officials have reiterated that a mutual defense treaty between the two countries applies to the disputed islands , known as @entity101 by @entity2 and @entity101 by @entity3			1
@entity0 will stress that " the @entity1 has a rock - solid commitment to our allies , " a senior administration official said this week			0
he will also push for a reduction in tensions in the region , the official said			0
@entity3 flies fighter jet into disputed air defense zone ; @entity2 remains defiant a bolder @entity3 but the @entity1 opposition to @entity3 's new air defense zone is n't simply a matter of supporting @entity2 and @entity17 , another @entity1 ally upset by the @entity3 claim			1
@entity1 officials say that @entity3 's zone impinges not only on existing zone 's declared by @entity2 and @entity17 , but also on international airspace that is regularly used by commercial carriers , civil aircraft and military planes			1
@entity3 argues , however , that it has the right to establish the air defense zone , just as @entity2 and @entity17 were allowed to set up theirs in previous decades			1
it has also left open the possibility that it could declare more zones in the region , notably in the @entity129 where it 's engaged in territorial disputes with the @entity131 , @entity132 and others			0
after @entity2 , @entity0 will travel to @entity6 , where he 'll meet with several top @entity3 officials , including president @entity135 , who assumed power slightly over a year ago			2
many analysts see @entity135 as the mastermind behind the new air defense zone declaration , identifying the move as part of an assertive new @entity3 foreign policy aimed at testing @entity1 resolve in the @entity144			1
@entity3 says it monitored @entity1 b - 52s that flew through its new air zone @entity1 officials have emphasized the importance of the personal relationships cultivated between top leaders in @entity6 and @entity56			2
the question is whether @entity0 's previous meetings with @entity135 will give him enough traction to defuse tensions over the @entity20			0
in an editorial published monday , the state - run newspaper @entity154 predicted that the air defense zone could be " a hard - to - navigate topic " for @entity0 and @entity160 prime minister @entity159 , who is also visiting @entity6 this week			2
the pivot to @entity9 the final stop on @entity0 's tour will be in @entity17 , another key @entity1 ally , where he will meet with president @entity165			2
@entity3 's new air defense identification zone partially encroaches on @entity17 's existing zone , and has drawn criticism from @entity169			1
but other sensitive issues concerning the @entity1 are also simmering on the @entity171			0
@entity172 is holding two @entity1 citizens prisoner , and @entity56 continues to press for their release			0
beyond the immediate issues , @entity0 's visit aims to underscore @entity1 commitment to its broader foreign policy goal of focusing more on the @entity9			1
that effort was undermined earlier this year when president @entity47 canceled a visit to four @entity183 nations -- including two regional summits -- because of the @entity1 government shutdown			0
" the message is clear and simple : the @entity1 is a resident @entity144 power , we 're here to stay , and we 're actively engaged on the full spectrum of issues in the region , " a senior administration official said last week			0
massive naval power remains at heart of @entity1 's look eastwards			0

@entity55 says @entity1 military and government planes wo n't recognize zone
@entity0 will visit @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity17 during an @entity183 visit
his trip comes as the region has been *roiled* by @entity3 's new air defense zone claim
@entity1 officials say @entity0 's visit is aimed at *voicing* concern but also reducing tensions
