@entity0 -- @entity4 's @entity3 will miss a service celebrating the @entity6 monday , as she continues to recover from an illness that left her hospitalized last week , @entity2 announced in a statement			1
the 86 - year - old monarch was admitted to a @entity0 hospital on march 3 with symptoms of gastroenteritis , an inflammation of the lining of the stomach and intestines , before being released the following day			0
a palace source told @entity1 the queen 's health problems are " nothing serious " and " nothing to fret about , " despite preventing her attending the @entity24 service at @entity0 's @entity25			1
the queen will still attend monday evening 's @entity28 at @entity29 , the statement said , where she will sign a new charter calling for equal rights in all @entity6 nations			1
the charter , adopted in december by all 54 countries over which the queen nominally presides , declares : " we are implacably opposed to all forms of discrimination , whether rooted in gender , race , colour , creed , political belief or other grounds			1
" while some observers believe the queen 's signing of the @entity49 signals her implicit support for gay rights and women 's equality , a @entity2 official said the monarch is merely carrying out her official duties			1
the official said : " the queen is apolitical and is signing the document in her capacity as head of the @entity6			2
" the 16 - point charter also embraces democracy , freedom of speech and the rule of law among its provisions			0
the charter 's principles could be difficult to implement in many @entity6 countries , like @entity68 and @entity69 , where homosexual acts are currently illegal			0
prince @entity71 , the queen 's husband , will attend the ceremony at @entity25 , where a recorded message from the queen will be played			0
this year 's @entity6 theme is " opportunity through enterprise , " and in the message the queen declares : " from climbing the highest mountain , to winning a sporting competition , making a scientific breakthrough , building a successful business or discovering unique artistic talent -- these outcomes all begin as a simple goal or idea in one person 's mind			0
" " our shared values of peace , democracy , development , justice and human rights -- which are found in our new ' @entity49 ' -- mean that we place special emphasis on including everyone in this goal , especially those who are vulnerable			2
" a @entity2 official said the queen , who celebrated her 60th year on the throne in 2012 , hopes to undertake some of her official engagements planned for the rest of this week .			0
