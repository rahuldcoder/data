-- a call for @entity2 brought together 1,253 dressed - up - in - blue people in @entity4 , @entity5			1
a 4,703 - pound cheesecake rolled out in @entity7			2
a 7 - year - old @entity9 boy made a ball of plastic wrap that 's 11 feet across			1
@entity13 of @entity14 has hair measuring 7.12 inches sprouting from the center of his outer ears			2
meanwhile , in @entity18 , @entity19 , 13 - year - old @entity17 is having a hard time fitting into cars			2
at 7 feet 4.6 inches , @entity17 -- who as a kindergartner was taller than his teacher -- has made it into the @entity27 2010 book , released thursday , as the tallest teenage boy			1
it 's a stature he said was earned simply because his 12th chromosome split in half			0
and while the height has its perks -- " you do n't get picked on as much " -- he wishes strangers would n't stare			0
" i 'm another person , just like everybody else , " said @entity17 , who does n't play basketball -- two knee replacements insured that -- and prefers to hang out with friends , camp and ride dirt bikes			1
the tallest teenage boy is one of about 4,000 records listed in this year 's book -- a number that accounts for a mere 10 percent of all the mind - blowing stats that make up the @entity27 database , said @entity49 , a spokesman for the organization that began publishing feats in 1955			1
see more world record holders from the obscure ( most balloons inflated with a nose ? 308 ) to the old standbys ( @entity57 , who died in 1890 , still holds the record for lightest adult at 4.7 pounds ) , it 's the reference - book gift that keeps on giving			1
so why would someone set out to spend the most time in a bumper car ( record : 24 hours ) , or solve the most @entity65 in one hour ( record : 185 ) ? " it 's an innate part of our psyche as human beings to explore how far we can push the boundaries , " said @entity67 , who 's been with @entity27 since 2000			1
" we 're intrigued by extremes in our daily life " and by " the things we 're not familiar with			0
" ireport.com : follow updates on " @entity78 " @entity79 of @entity80 , @entity9 , was only 6 when high school students in his area set out to assemble the largest group of people wearing @entity86 glasses			0
a snowstorm killed the attempt , but the idea of setting a record became an obsession for the young boy , his mom @entity87 said			1
" i told him , ' we 'll get a bunch of books , and we 'll see if there 's anything we can do , ' " she said			0
building a ball of plastic wrap was where they landed			0
and what started with a softball - sized ball grew and grew and grew into a 281 - pound monstrosity , earning @entity108 , now 9 , a spot in this year 's record book			1
" it does take up a nice corner of the garage , " @entity87 said with a laugh			0
and when people comment on how " cool " it is , she said her husband 's response is always the same : " you want it ? take it			0
" ireport.com : massive chess board with human pieces @entity67 , of @entity27 , has seen everything from the innocuous to the extreme and dangerous			1
he 's watched a motorcycle rider crash -- and survive -- trying to outdo the ramp - to - ramp distance jump , just one of the " pushing the envelope " moments that helped him " realize just how out there the world of record breaking can be , " he said			2
some images might be hard to take in at first			0
" over 1,000 piercings in the human body is something you have to get used to looking at , " @entity67 said			0
and while the most tattooed man -- 99 percent of his body is covered -- " may not be my cup of tea , " he said that when it comes to categories there 's something for everyone			0
@entity151 , 68 , of @entity152 , @entity153 , earned the top berth for longest fingernails after not cutting them from 1979 onward			2
as of the last record - setting measurement , her nails were 28 - foot long in total , the longest being her left index fingernail that came in at 3 - foot , @entity67 said			2
but a car accident in february of this year left her nails broken and her hands much freer , the @entity27 spokesman said			1
ireport.com : @entity166 's largest rocking chair ? " they were such a part of her , " he said , before describing @entity151 's attitude as " very stoic , " and her take on the broken nails this way : " if something like that had to happen , it had to happen			0
someone somewhere had decided enough is enough			0
" this year 's book release includes a look at the top 100 records of this century 's first decade , @entity67 added , as well as beefed up offerings on the @entity27 web site , which is also where wannabe record holders can find out how to compete and get recognized -- if not now , then in the next book 's edition			1
since the current record - holding @entity2 gathered in @entity5 and after the 2010 book went to press , for example , 2,510 ambitious blue ones amassed in a nightclub in @entity191			1
ireport.com : large gathering of " @entity194 " does @entity67 have his own eyes on a record prize ? " i want to spin a quarter for the longest time possible , " he said , adding that the current record is 19.34 seconds			2
