the government of the small @entity2 island of @entity3 recently announced proposals to start selling citizenship of its nation to foreigners for € 650,000 ( about $ 888,000 )			1
but faced with rising criticism both in @entity3 and other @entity12 countries , the @entity3 government has temporarily halted the law 's implementation and will review its requirements			1
the @entity16 is to hold a debate on the scheme on 15 january 2014			0
" the citizenship scheme as adopted by the @entity3 @entity16 in recent weeks seems to be a clear abuse of @entity12 citizenship and @entity23 rules , said @entity25 chairman @entity24			1
" even if the @entity3 give in to reason , and drop this scheme , it remains important that the @entity16 debates this issue			1
" but @entity3 continues to defend the program , which is said to target affluent individuals in order to boost @entity3 's economy , but insists : " it 's not an over-the - counter sale of citizenships , said @entity29 , head of communications for the @entity3 government			1
" applicants have to go through a thorough due diligence screening process , he told @entity39			1
" we are still discussing the details and regulations and there might be amendments made , for example to the fee of € 650,000 , " @entity29 said			1
the unique program , would give holders of this @entity3 passport a tremendous amount of liberty			2
unlike other similar programs in the @entity12 , applicants for program are not obliged to live in @entity3 before being granted a passport			1
instead , if the application is successful and the applicant is wealthy enough to spare the large sum , he or she will get a @entity3 passport -- and therefore @entity12 citizenship -- immediately			1
so , the applicant could theoretically live in any of the other 27 member states of the @entity12			0
@entity3 joined the @entity12 in 2004 ; it is a member of the @entity23 borderless travel area , and has a visa waiver agreement with the @entity68 -- all perks that would come with @entity3 citizenship for foreigners			1
@entity3 citizenship already allows a holder to travel to 163 countries across the globe without a visa			1
@entity3 's prime minister @entity77 has predicted that the scheme will bring in more than $ 41 million ( € 30 million ) annually , and help ease the country 's deficit , while also attracting " high value " people who could potentially invest in the island			1
@entity84 , an international firm specializing in international immigration and citizenship law , will administer the initiative			0
" of course @entity3 is trying to raise capital with the program , but it is also opening its doors to a very beneficial segment of the world population , said @entity94 , the company 's ceo			2
" many people conduct businesses abroad , but they are restricted by the passports they hold to do international travel , " he added			0
the change of plan means people can register their interest in the scheme with @entity84 , but can not officially apply until the @entity3 government reveals its planned amendments			1
once the law goes into effect , applicants will have to go through a 4 - tier due diligence process			1
after filling out the application documents , the application is reviewed on online databases , this is followed by a background check and a risk assessment which examines the applicant 's nationality , job sector and where he or she conducts business			0
lastly the information is verified against government databases , including @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity128 police files			0
previous criminal convictions , misstating or fabricating information or issues with the applicant 's source of wealth could all lead to an application being refused			0
in the best case scenario , @entity84 expects the whole process , from filing an application to getting a passport , to take about four to six months			0
" @entity3 is taking many thorough steps in the vetting process , " said @entity94			1
@entity94 says he expected between 200 and 300 people a year to be willing to stump up the estimated $ 1.2 million ( € 850,000 ) cost of applying , once processing fees and other expenses are taken into account			0
whether anything can be done to stop the program 's implementation , still remains to be seen			0
the @entity12 said it could not interfere with citizenship decisions made by individual @entity12 countries			0
" member states have full sovereignty to decide how and to whom they grant their nationality , " said @entity153 , press officer for the @entity154			0
" the @entity161 has on several occasions confirmed the principle of international law , that it is for each member state to lay down the conditions for the acquisition of its nationality , " he said			0
@entity170 , leader of @entity3 's opposition @entity171 , called the program 's passage a " black day for democracy			2
" some critics also claim that the program favors the super-rich and provides a fast - track entry into the @entity12 , while foreigners with no financial means are excluded from the program			2
@entity183 , director of the aditus foundation , a @entity3 - based human rights @entity184 , said : " many people who desperately need to come to the @entity12 simply can not do it and the boat tragedies out at sea are witness to this , " he said			2
" we have men , women and children fleeing wars and persecution who are unable to obtain legal entry to the @entity12 simply because no embassy will grant them an entry visa			0
" several @entity12 countries offer residence permits that include free movement within the @entity23 area , in exchange for high fees and the requirement to invest in the country , like @entity128 's tier 1 investor scheme for @entity212 citizens with £ 1 million ( $ 1.6 million ) or more of private funds available for investment in the @entity128			2
in contrast to other existing immigration programs , the @entity3 version is an expedited citizenship program			2
" the program is aimed at cash - rich but time - poor people			0
there is a growing breed of individuals who do n't have the time to be in one country for more than four months , @entity94 said , praising @entity3 's pm as " a visionary who sees the benefits of globalization			2
