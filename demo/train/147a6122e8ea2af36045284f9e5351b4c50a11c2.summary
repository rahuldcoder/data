-- technology issues might not be the most pressing topic facing @entity3 — @entity5 's running mate — as he campaigns for the @entity6			1
in fact , given the state of the economy and the other high - level issues facing the country , it 's unlikely that @entity3 or any of the other national candidates will be asked substantial questions about technology policy in the coming months			1
however , even if @entity3 does n't get asked a single question about technology or the @entity19 , it 's still possible to glean some of his positions from his voting record and prior interviews			1
here , we have done just that			0
@entity25 & @entity19 piracy the @entity25 , or @entity25 , was almost universally vilified by those in the tech community			1
@entity3 never co-sponsored the bill , but that did n't stop rumors from circulating that he supported it			2
eventually , @entity3 was at least partially forced to make a statement on the bill by pressure from a group of @entity38 users who either found his stance vague or believed he supported the bill			0
that group began " @entity48 , " a grassroots effort to support @entity3 's opponent in an upcoming @entity47 race			1
soon after the @entity38 group began gaining momentum , @entity3 announced his opposition to @entity25 , saying that it would create " the precedent and possibility for undue regulation , censorship and legal abuse			1
" he added that the @entity19 is " one of the most magnificent expressions of freedom and free enterprise in history " and it should " stay that way			2
" he did , however , add that @entity19 piracy was a " legitimate problem			1
" the opponent supported by the @entity66 , @entity65 , declared his opposition to @entity25 and did an " @entity67 , " a form of crowdsourced interview for which @entity38 has become famous			0
later , @entity65 credited the @entity72 's efforts to get @entity3 to commit to an @entity74 stance			2
" @entity38 was able to force the @entity75 to reverse course — shock waves will be felt throughout the establishment in @entity78 today , and other lawmakers will take notice , " wrote @entity65			0
net neutrality net neutrality , the idea that @entity19 networks should n't distinguish between the types of traffic carried across them , is a contentious issue in @entity47			2
many liberals feel it would prevent @entity90 from slowing the web services of competitors , while many conservatives believe it interferes with the free market by regulating private industry			0
@entity3 , a conservative @entity96 , falls into that latter camp			0
in 2006 , he voted against a @entity99 - sponsored amendment that would have established network neutrality as law			1
last year , @entity3 voted for a @entity6 resolution disapproving of @entity104 regulations mandating that any traffic management on the part of @entity90 be " reasonable " — a step towards net neutrality			1
open government @entity3 , who has an active online presence , is a proponent of open government and a fan of technology 's impact on governance : " when i started in @entity47 it was 90 % paper , 10 % electronic , now it 's 90 % electronic , 10 % paper and constituent correspondence is up tenfold , " said @entity3 of technology 's impact on the relationship between voters and elected officials during an interview at @entity122			2
" [ technology and social media ] strips away the intermediary that media plays between people and their government			0
it gets rid of that middleman and allows people to interact directly with their elected officials			0
the flattening of that process has been tremendously helpful to those of us who want to hear what people think			0
" is it important to you that the president and vice president share your opinion on technology issues ? do you want @entity3 , @entity5 , president @entity146 and vice president @entity147 to directly address their stances on tech policy ? share your thoughts in the comments			1
