-- at least one member of the jury that sentenced @entity3 to death in the arson homicides of his three children says she is struggling with the idea that she might have convicted an innocent man			1
it has been 17 years since @entity3 was convicted in @entity10 of setting a house fire that killed his children , a crime @entity3 vehemently denied right up until his execution in 2004			1
since that time , three investigations have concluded arson was not the likely cause of the 1991 fire , including one that arrived in @entity10 gov. @entity22 's office 88 minutes before the scheduled execution			1
@entity22 replaced four of nine members of the @entity25 in recent weeks , just before the commission was to receive a report from the latest of the three investigations			2
the controversy has led juror @entity29 to think twice about the decision she made in a jury room in 1992			1
" i do n't sleep at night because of a lot of this , " @entity29 said			1
" i have gone back and forth in my mind trying to think of anything that we missed			0
i do n't like the fact that years later someone is saying maybe we made a mistake , that the facts are n't what they could 've been			1
" @entity29 spoke with @entity0 by phone from her @entity45 home			1
she has long since moved away from tiny @entity46 , @entity10 , where the fire took place			0
" i do have doubts now , " she said			0
" i mean , we can only go with what we knew at the time , but i do n't like the fact now that maybe this man was executed by our word because of evidence that is not true			1
it may not be true now			0
and i do n't like the fact that i may have to face my @entity59 and explain what i did			1
" " when you 're sitting there with all those facts , there was nothing else we could see , " she said			0
" now i do n't know			2
i ca n't tell you he 's innocent , i ca n't say 100 percent he 's guilty			2
" @entity29 had another revelation			1
she said she thought she would be excluded from the jury because of her family 's close relationship with key witness and then - @entity46 assistant fire chief @entity73			0
her father was also a fire marshal for eight years before the @entity76 fire			0
" i was raised with my father being a fire marshal , " she said			0
" he went around proving that stuff , so he was n't here at that time			2
but i knew @entity81 , who was one of the witnesses			0
it was no secret , but i did n't think they would pick me as a juror because of it			2
" critics say @entity22 's recent actions to shake up the commission were politically motivated , a charge he denies			0
@entity22 's office said it received a five - page fax on the day of the execution that contained an arson expert 's findings that the fire was not deliberately set			1
it is unclear whether @entity22 read the fax. " given the brevity of the report and the general counsel 's familiarity with all the other facts in the case , there was ample time for the general counsel to read and analyze the report and to brief the governor on its contents , " @entity22 spokeswoman @entity98 said			0
@entity3 was executed less than two hours later			1
death - penalty opponents say an impartial review of @entity3 's case could lead to an unprecedented admission -- that the state executed an innocent man			1
the latest report concluded that the arson ruling at the heart of @entity3 's conviction " could not be sustained " by modern science or the standards of the time			1
@entity22 said he remains confident @entity3 was guilty , as do authorities in @entity46 , south of @entity125 , who prosecuted @entity3			2
@entity3 's wife 's brother , @entity127 , said in a signed affidavit that @entity130 told her family that @entity3 confessed to killing the children during her visit to him on death row a few days before the execution			1
but @entity130 testified for her husband during his trial , while her family argued he was guilty			0
@entity0 could not reach her for comment			0
even @entity3 's defense attorney , @entity139 , remains confident his client committed the crime			2
" there was no question whatsoever that he was guilty , " @entity139 said on @entity0 's " @entity142 " thursday night			0
@entity139 slammed the most recent report on the @entity147 ham case , by @entity149 arson expert @entity148 , as " one of the least objective reports i 've ever read			2
" on thursday , @entity22 also lambasted the @entity148 report as having " a very politically driven agenda " and being propaganda for the anti-death penalty movement			0
@entity148 , asked about @entity22 's statements , said they were " strange and clueless			0

@entity3 maintained his innocence up until his execution in 2004
@entity29 says new evidence makes her think she made *wrong* decision
" i do n't like the fact that i may have to face my @entity59 and explain what i did , " she says
3 inquiries have concluded that arson was not likely cause of deaths
