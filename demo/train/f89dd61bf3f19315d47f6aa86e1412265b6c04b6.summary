-- back in the mid- 1960s , a @entity2 guerrilla group called @entity3 -- the @entity4 -- began launching cross-border attacks against @entity7 civilians			2
sponsored by @entity8 and led by @entity2 activists , among them the young @entity10 , @entity3 aroused admiration throughout the @entity13 world			0
so much so that @entity15 , then @entity8 's rival , formed its own group and called it the @entity17 -- the @entity17 -- which also staged attacks into @entity7			2
the @entity7 would n't sit passively , though , but struck back at @entity3 's @entity8 hosts , who in turn shelled @entity7 villages			0
not to be outdone , @entity15 in may 1967 evicted @entity24 peacekeeping forces from the @entity25 and amassed troops along @entity7 's border			2
this precipitated an @entity7 pre-emptive strike against @entity15 which , within hours , ensnarled @entity8 and even @entity30			0
six days later , @entity7 troops controlled the territories , whose final status remains bitterly unresolved			0
recalling the background to the @entity36 -- a conflict almost nobody wanted and even fewer anticipated -- is crucial today in the face of a frightfully similar process unfolding along @entity7 's southern border			1
if left unchecked , the rising violence in @entity43 could quickly spiral uncontrollably			0
another conflagration , no more desired or foreseen than that of 1967 , could once again engulf the @entity46			1
though @entity3 and the @entity17 merged long ago and are now headed by @entity10 , who has since forsworn terror , other @entity2 groups are vying for power			0
by attacking @entity7 , they gain credibility in the @entity2 street and prestige throughout the region			0
one such group was @entity56 , a wing of the @entity58 , that violently expelled @entity10 ' men from @entity43 in 2007 and proceeded to fire thousands of rockets at @entity7			1
still not passive , @entity7 retaliated with punishing operations in @entity43 in 2008 and 2012			1
those blows , together with the @entity58 's fall from power in @entity15 , subdued @entity56 , but now another @entity43 organization has risen to challenge it			1
@entity66 has been firing rockets and aiming ground attacks at @entity7			1
characteristically , the @entity7 responded with force and earlier this week killed three @entity66 operatives engaged in mounting a strike			1
the terrorists then fired some 50 rockets and mortar shells at southern @entity7 towns , spurring @entity7 fighter jets to bomb 29 targets in @entity43			1
( an @entity66 leader told @entity0 on thursday a truce had been declared , but the @entity7 government has not commented			1
) but @entity7 regards @entity56 as the sovereign authority in @entity43 and holds it ultimately responsible for any attacks emanating from there , even those conducted by @entity66			1
if the rocket fire and shelling continue , @entity7 is likely to retaliate against @entity56 , which could be dragged , however unwillingly , into the fighting			2
@entity66 is funded and armed by @entity88			0
just last week , @entity7 naval commandos intercepted a cargo ship -- the @entity90 -- carrying 400,000 bullets and 40 rockets capable of hitting @entity93			2
made in @entity88 , the arms would have enabled @entity66 to join with @entity95 , @entity88 's chief proxy in @entity97 , to rocket every @entity7 city			2
the goal is to deter @entity7 from striking @entity88 's nuclear facilities and to paralyze it with multiple existential threats			0
but what if @entity88 -- much like @entity15 in 1967 -- miscalculated ? what could happen if an @entity7 reprisal for @entity66 's rockets results in a confrontation between @entity7 and @entity56 ? would @entity95 then join the clash , unleashing its arsenal of more than 100,000 rockets against the jewish state , and would @entity7 forces have to invade @entity97 to stop them ? would @entity88 watch idly while its closest @entity46 ally was crushed by the " @entity116 enemy , " or would it , too , leap into the fray ? @entity43 remains a combat zone as of this writing , and rocket alert sirens are wailing in southern @entity7 cities			1
as in previous exchanges , a de facto cease - fire might be worked out and relative calm restored to the region			0
or the confrontation could widen , and what began as a skirmish could inexorably expand into war			0
as the example of 1967 reminds us , a single spark in the combustible @entity46 can swiftly fan a flare - up into a firestorm			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity138 .			0

@entity138 : the flare - up in @entity43 could ignite a wider war
in 1967 , conflicts in the @entity46 spiraled into the @entity36 , he says
@entity138 : @entity66 , challenging @entity56 for *supremacy* in @entity43 , launched rockets into @entity7
he says the question is whether a truce can prevent conflict from becoming conflagration
