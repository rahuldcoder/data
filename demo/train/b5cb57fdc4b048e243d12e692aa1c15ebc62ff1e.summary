@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's very rarely @entity5 cities get compared with their flashy @entity7 counterparts , yet , when it comes to cost of living @entity0 is n't just competing with its neighbors in @entity7 -- it 's beating them			1
hotel rooms in @entity0 , now the 30th most expensive city in the world , now cost hundreds of dollars a night			1
@entity1 's coastal economic and financial capital is the shock entry in the top 50 cities of this year 's @entity18 survey			1
the vibrant home to almost eight million @entity1 beat off the likes of @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , and even @entity25 locations such as @entity26 and @entity27 -- to be rated the 30th most expensive city in the world			1
its streets are now home to @entity33 , its waterways play host to multi-million dollar super-yachts , and its hotel rooms fetch hundreds of dollars per night			0
yes , if the @entity18 survey is anything to go by this is an economic " boom - town			0
" but , how can a city from such a notoriously poverty - stricken region of the world rise to join this list of riches ? the answer : a mix of democracy , private investment and tourism -- according to @entity0 governor , @entity50			1
part of the city 's current level of development undoubtedly rests with the growth achieved during the oil boom of the 1970s , which saw a population explosion and unrestrained economic growth			1
but @entity50 believes there are number of contemporary factors pushing the seventh fastest growing metropolis in the world forwards into a " truly international city			1
" there is a wealth of local resources which has helped the region grow , and now private sector business is becoming the major driver to financial success			2
" the government is trying to engage with the private sector			0
it 's about engaging in partnerships with the private sector -- partnerships that other countries have used successfully for a long time			2
" i think [ @entity0 is ] beginning to take its rightful place in the community of top international cities			1
" @entity50 believes the democratic climate in @entity1 has helped the @entity0 region develop by offering new - found freedom to local governments , private investors , and other independent groups			1
" there 's no perfect democracy			2
but , if you look at where we came from almost nine years ago , when you could n't criticize government , we are better off today			0
elected officials can now be held to account			0
" he said that the environment allowed for more robust planning between the government , individuals and the wider public			0
independent investors are helping improve local services by investing in private hospitals and schools , but @entity50 admits there is still plenty of work to be done , with infrastructure still not up to the standards of other major cities around the world			1
" these other cities like @entity114 have reliable and efficient power supply 24 hours a day			0
we still do not have that in @entity0			2
" he told @entity2 he did not agree with @entity120 's cost of living survey placing @entity0 as the " 30th most expensive city in the world			1
" " life can not be measured like this			0
you ca n't compare @entity0 with other cities across the globe and across the continent			1
" you can not put them on the same scale as they do not have the same resources and infrastructure , " @entity50 said			2
he added that @entity0 is expensive compared to other parts of the country , but that was like comparing prices between " @entity138 and @entity139			1
" " the greater the population and the greater the demand for goods , then the forces of demand and supply will push up the price , " he said			0
despite this , @entity50 believes the development of @entity0 has not made the city unaffordable for locals			1
some central city rents are said to be as high as us $ 6,000 - $ 7,000 per month , but @entity50 said the situation was the same in many @entity7 cities , and locals were surviving			1
however , if prices are high now , there 's little to suggest they will ease in the near future			0
@entity50 said the growing number of tourists are bringing a lot of new money into the city			2
" people are coming in as tourists , but tourists are also investors			0
they come here to do business at the same time , " he said			0
he believes the key to @entity0 ' future is catering to these groups			2
" we are providing a mix of business and pleasure			0
a city where people can live , work and play			0
" i would like it to become a truly international city , and a center of tourism and business			2
it has a wonderful @entity186 coastline and we need to use it , " @entity50 said			0
if cost of living measures and growth meters are anything to go by -- @entity0 is well on the way to that end .			0
