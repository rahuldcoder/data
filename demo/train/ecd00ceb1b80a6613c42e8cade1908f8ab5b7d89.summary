the future of space travel will depend on our ability to make rockets that can be used more than once , says @entity6 ceo @entity5			1
and on saturday , he gave a crowd at the @entity9 festival the world 's first look at a step in that direction			1
@entity5 , whose @entity14 is currently docked on the @entity15 , showed a packed exhibit hall a two - day - old video of @entity18 , an experimental rocket			1
if fully realized , the rocket would propel spacecraft out of the earth 's atmosphere , then flip around , sprout landing gear and return intact to the launch pad			0
in the video , a 10 - story - high @entity18 rocket did just that -- except for the leaving - the - atmosphere part			0
it blasted off , hovered , and then set itself down at virtually the same spot where it began			0
the video , with its @entity37 " @entity38 " soundtrack , drew cheers from the crowd			0
friday was n't the first time @entity18 has left the ground , but it was the most ambitious test to date , @entity5 said			1
" with each successive test , we want to go higher and further , " he said			0
@entity5 , a festival keynote speaker , made his fortune as the founder of @entity48			1
from there , he 's taken on private spaceflight as ceo of @entity6 , electric vehicles as ceo and chief designer of @entity54 , and solar energy as chairman of @entity57			1
" @entity60 may be the planet 's most exciting entrepreneur , " said @entity59 director @entity58			0
historic launch of private rocket heralds new era during a question - and - answer session with " @entity67 " editor - in - chief @entity68 , @entity5 said that affordable commercial space travel will never be possible with the current model , which relies on single - use booster rockets			1
" every mode of transportation we 're used to ... they 're all reusable , but not rockets , " @entity5 said			1
" if we ca n't make rockets reusable , the cost is just prohibitive			1
" he said a reusable rocket could make space launches 100 times cheaper			2
the price of fuel , oxygen and the like for a launch currently amounts to just a fraction of 1 % of its overall cost , he said			0
@entity5 also recounted the stressful moments around last week 's launch of the unmanned @entity14 cargo vessel , which linked up with the @entity89 last sunday			1
" it 's extremely nerve - wracking , " he said			0
" the thing about a rocket launch is that all your work is distilled into these few minutes , especially the few seconds before liftoff			0
" @entity98 mission had some extra nail - biting moments			0
once in space , three of its four thruster pods malfunctioned			2
engineers were able to write new code and beam it to the capsule and " pressure slam " oxygen into tanks that had failed to oxidize			0
" we were sort of trying to give it the spacecraft equivalent of the @entity113 maneuver , " he said			0
i do n't want to go through that again			2
" @entity5 also confirmed that , while he 's in @entity117 , he 's meeting with state lawmakers about the possibility of building a commercial launch site in the state			1
currently , @entity6 -- which both works alongside @entity123 and counts the agency among its clients -- launches from @entity127 in @entity128 and @entity129 in @entity130 , which are both government sites			2
@entity5 said @entity117 is the leading candidate for the launch site and that , if things go smoothly , construction could begin as early as next year .			2
