-- from the single , centrally - positioned seat to the crash - proof frame , this @entity2 - like car is an alluring piece of kit			2
it would make any driver stand out in a traffic jam , and it 's completely road legal			2
but the truly ground - breaking feature of @entity13 's ultra-sleek design is still under wraps			1
the company are developing an autonomous rear wing that self - transforms according to the conditions			2
in rainy weather it curves to increase downforce for a safer drive , and straightens out when the downpour clears			2
this process is powered by the rain itself			2
the startling concept is the result of collaboration with @entity30 's pioneering @entity29 , which seeks to programme materials to build themselves , and transform how we make things			1
" any place that uses robotics today , you could use materials and have the same capabilities , " says @entity34 , a computational architect who leads the @entity29 and the movement			0
" with planes , we have done a great job of making articulated wings to have lift , to change aerodynamics and make the plane functional			0
but the weight , energy and control mechanisms involved are pretty excessive at this point			0
trying to find more elegant solutions seems an obvious target , and what we 're proposing is a single material with the same actuation capability , the same sensing , the same range of movement , if not more			2
" the self - assembly process has been described as 4d printing			1
@entity34 ' team produce composite materials that react in predictable ways when exposed to external stimulus such as water			0
the materials are 3d - printed into specific shapes and then autonomously transform into another , with wide - ranging implications for industry from automotive to medical to military			1
but the dream for a new paradigm of component - free , labor - sparing robotics requires further breakthroughs			1
" more materials , more energy sources , " @entity34 says are the current priorities			0
@entity82 and carbon fibers are responding well , but " can we do it with everyday materials , with repeatability ? can we fuel it with heat and light ? " if he can , the results would not merely match existing capabilities			0
" we can develop material compositions that respond to many different triggers , or find solutions that have n't been programmed but fall within an acceptable range			1
they could self - optimize based on logic and sensing			2
" @entity34 acknowledges that " not every industry likes surprises , " but the lab 's client list indicates a huge appetite for self - assembly			1
in addition to @entity13 , the team are collaborating with @entity109 to develop the wing design			0
they are working with engineering giants @entity112 to deliver autonomous pipes that expand , narrow and regulate the flow , taking on the function of pump and valve			0
fashion and furniture are also targets -- making the self - lacing sneakers of ' @entity123 ' a possibility at last			1
@entity126 's dr. @entity125 is leading a wide - ranging exploration of @entity129 printing , which recently received a grant from the @entity132 military , along with two other research institutions			1
morphing camouflage is among the mooted targets			0
demand for @entity129 is reaching a fever pitch , says dr. @entity138 , founder of @entity139 , which produces the materials used by the @entity29 , as well as supplying them to major business clients			1
" our clients are looking for the next big idea , they are actively seeking innovation and believe this could transform manufacturing , " says @entity138			1
" if you have products that know how to mould and assemble based on energy , it takes out the menial labor that has forced manufacturers to relocate abroad where it 's cheaper			1
" @entity138 believes transport is the fastest - progressing sector for the concept , and expects automotive examples to be on the market as early as 2016			1
once self - assembly is proven , it could spread as rapidly as its precursor 3d printing , along with concerns about the implications			1
" everyone is always scared that technology will take our jobs , " says @entity166 , rolling his eyes			0
" but it has always created jobs rather than destroyed them			0
another fear is it will get out of control , or be abused			0
but we should be afraid of people not technology , we should n't stop inventing			0
" if the full scale of his vision is realized , we might need to do little else			0

self - assembling *vehicles* ready to hit the market
almost any material could be programmed to build itself , a process known as @entity129 printing
@entity30 's self - assembly lab have *partnership* in industries from fashion to aviation
the process will transform manufacturing and labor
