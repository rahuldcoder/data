@entity0 -- like a partisan version of the proverbial blind men touching the elephant , members of @entity3 have starkly differing views of the scope and magnitude of the @entity10 targeting of conservative groups seeking tax - exempt status that dominates headlines and committee hearings			1
depending on their party , legislators offer particular takes on the controversy based on which part of the @entity10 elephant they are describing			1
@entity20 portray the controversy uncovered by an inspector general 's report last month as another example of big government gone wild under president @entity26			1
" it is his administration , it is the @entity26 @entity10 , and we intend to try and get to truth here as to what exactly happened and get to the facts , " house majority leader @entity27 , a @entity28 @entity20 , told reporters on tuesday			1
@entity37 chairman @entity36 said after a hearing on tuesday with victims of the targeting that the scope of the problem was larger than first thought			1
" this is a nationwide , systematic approach targeting people and groups of conservative beliefs , " @entity36 declared			2
as part of their messaging for next year 's congressional elections and the 2016 presidential vote , some @entity20 try to draw parallels to the @entity53 of the 1970s that led to @entity20 president @entity55 's resignation			1
" we will not tolerate another political enemies list , " @entity57 chairman @entity56 , a @entity58 @entity20 , said monday in a clear reference to the @entity55 administration			1
" we 've been there before			0
having an enemies list harkens back to a dark page in our past , and the arrogance of power that we 've seen from those involved in this instance is deeply , deeply disconcerting , " @entity56 said			1
@entity70 say they are equally outraged that the @entity10 unit based in @entity72 that handles requests for 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) tax - exempt status used a list of criteria including group names that included " tea party " and other conservative labels to assess the level of scrutiny applied			1
however , they argue , no evidence of an administration - wide conspiracy has emerged so far , with the inspector general 's report that revealed the problem blaming poor management and stating there was no known political motivation			1
" there is no smoking gun , " said @entity70 rep. @entity93 of @entity94 at tuesday 's hearing , while his party colleague rep. @entity96 of @entity97 added that similar targeting of liberal groups occurred under @entity20 president @entity100			2
" where was the outrage then ? " @entity96 asked			0
some democrats said tougher scrutiny of groups seeking tax - exempt status was warranted after the 2010 @entity110 ruling in the @entity112 case that removed limits on some campaign spending by corporations and unions			0
rep. @entity117 , a @entity0 @entity118 , told the panel of witnesses representing conservative groups who underwent greater @entity10 scrutiny that the issue involved a gray area of potentially political organizations seeking tax - exempt status			2
" each of your groups is highly political , " @entity117 told the panel that included organizations opposed to gay marriage and abortion			0
" you all are entrenched in some of the most controversial political issues in the country			0
" by applying for tax - exempt status , " you 're asking the government to help fund that , " he added			0
@entity20 rep. @entity140 took exception to @entity117 's point , telling the panelists " welcome to @entity0 " after his @entity70 colleague completed his comments			0
" you 're to blame , i guess is the message here , " @entity140 said , noting that there was no evidence presented to the committee that liberal groups received the same extra scrutiny and delayed responses as the conservative organizations			0
on monday , the new head of the embattled @entity10 was asked how he would restore public trust in the agency after the targeting scandal and a new report on tuesday that described wasteful spending			1
" it is going to be a difficult process , " acknowledged @entity161 , a career public servant appointed by @entity26 last month to clean up the mess dominating the early months of his second term			0
@entity161 described a process of identifying what happened , who was responsible and steps to ensure it can never happen again to address what republicans depict as politically motivated harassment that abused the constitutional rights of conservative groups			2
' liar ' charge a step too far for some @entity20 at tuesday 's hearing , the fifth so far on the controversy with another scheduled for later this week , witnesses from conservative groups targeted by the @entity10 described themselves as shocked by what happened and fearful over what it meant			1
@entity188 of the @entity189 in @entity190 declared that additional questioning and other @entity10 delays over her organization 's application " was a willful act of intimidation to discourage our little group			2
" " they think they are our master , and they are mistaken , " she said , her voice quavering with emotion			0
" i want to protect and preserve the @entity204 that i grew up in			0
i am terrified it is slipping away			0
" @entity206 , chairman of the @entity207 , accused the @entity10 of leaking this organization 's confidential donor list in violation of felony law			1
he took issue with a statement by a @entity70 panel member that the @entity10 targeting was inadvertent , saying the agency " deliberately provided our donor list to a political adversary who had been seeking it for a long time			1
" @entity70 rep. @entity220 of @entity221 argued that @entity206 's description of the @entity223 as a political foe raised questions about whether his group was devoted to social welfare , as required for tax - exempt status			0
that prompted another witness , @entity230 of @entity231 , which describes itself as a conservative education group for young people , to criticize @entity220 for political bias			0
" some of the @entity70 on the committee implied that what 's social welfare to them is social welfare , but what 's social welfare to us is negotiable , " he said to applause from the public gallery in the hearing room			0
on thursday , the @entity247 will examine the wasteful @entity10 spending reported by a separate inspector general 's report made public on tuesday			1
it showed that the @entity10 spent about $ 50 million on 225 conferences between 2010 and 2012			2
one of those , an august 2010 meeting for 2,600 employees in @entity256 , @entity257 , cost more than $ 4 million for everything from event planners ' commissions to speakers ' fees to guest prizes to parody videos			0
the audit notes that a large chunk of that money - about $ 3.2 million - came from unused funds allocated for hiring			0
this was in the same year that the @entity10 began to single out conservative and tea party groups that sought tax - exempt status , in part because the agency said it did not have the personnel to handle increased applications that year			2
in response , the @entity10 said it has cut training costs and reduced spending on meetings by 87 % since 2010			2
" the expenditures related to this 2010 meeting are not reflective of the current spending environment at the @entity10 or the spending that has occurred over the past several years , " wrote @entity282 , the agency 's chief financial officer			2
at the same time , @entity282 defended the need for large - scale conferences at the time , noting that nearly a third of managers in the division under scrutiny were inexperienced , and the agency faced added concerns about security after a @entity298 man crashed his plane into the @entity10 office in @entity301 , killing himself and two other people			2
" although the average cost per employee was reasonable , the @entity10 recognizes that a number of less significant costs warranted additional scrutiny and were not the best use of government resources , " @entity282 wrote			2
@entity10 faces new battle on overspending meanwhile , the @entity10 targeting also is under investigation by the @entity314 , the @entity317 inspector general 's office and @entity318 in his new capacity			1
a former @entity321 official , @entity161 took over from former @entity10 commissioner @entity322 , who resigned under pressure after news of the targeting emerged			1
@entity326 : @entity72 @entity10 employees say direction came from @entity0 republicans at tuesday 's hearing expressed frustration with what they called a lack of government accountability so far , as well as the need for more information on who was responsible for the targeting			1
" for anyone to suggest that these individuals ' rights should be limited because of political differences is discrimination , " said @entity20 rep. @entity339 of @entity340 , adding that there would be no question of wrongdoing if the bias involved " white versus black " or " jews versus @entity346			0
" @entity70 sought a legislative solution , saying the lack of clarity over what constitutes political activity left @entity10 bureaucrats in the position of having to make that assessment			2
read @entity10 watchdog 's report by the @entity362 : @entity10 the @entity10 controversy has provoked an increasingly bitter dispute between the @entity365 and congressional republicans that included harsh accusations by both sides last weekend			1
@entity365 spokesman @entity369 declined to comment directly monday on the accusation by @entity247 chairman @entity326 that he was a " paid liar			1
" on tuesday , @entity27 dodged questions about whether he agreed with @entity326 's insult			0
@entity10 investigation takes nasty turn when asked by reporters about @entity326 's comments , @entity27 instead deflected the issue back to the @entity365 , saying " there 's been an abuse of trust on the part of this administration towards the @entity204 people			1
we 're going to remain committed to getting to the bottom of this and let the truth come out			0
" meanwhile , @entity27 's @entity70 counterpart blasted @entity326 , calling the comment about @entity369 " outrageous " and saying an apology was in order			0
" he ought to retract that statement unless he has specific evidence which i do n't believe he does , " said @entity393 @entity392 of @entity394			0
" i think it was a reckless statement and undermines his presentation as someone as a judicious leader of oversight			0
" @entity392 added that such " wild accusations " indicated " real political bias " on the part of @entity326 , making it difficult to trust him to conduct an investigation of the @entity10 targeting and other issues			1
other democrats have accused @entity326 of dirty tactics in previous investigations , including one into the botched " @entity420 " gun - walking operation that led to @entity414 citing @entity70 attorney general @entity415 for contempt of @entity3 in a dispute over access to documents			1
@entity1 's @entity421 , @entity422 , @entity423 and @entity424 contributed to this report .			0
