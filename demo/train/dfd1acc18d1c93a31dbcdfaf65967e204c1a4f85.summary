twenty - nine patients at the @entity1 in @entity2 have been diagnosed with @entity4 ' disease since january 2011 , raising questions about the institution 's safety practices			1
five of the cases " are known to have acquired the disease from the hospital , " the @entity8 said			1
another eight were infected elsewhere , and the source of the infection in 16 cases can not been determined			0
the spate of illnesses has led relatives of two veterans who died after contracting the disease , a type of pneumonia , to blame the hospital			1
@entity23 has learned that hospital officials knew they had a problem with the water system as far back as last december , but chose not to reveal that until a month ago			1
that 's when the hospital began turning off the water in parts of the hospital , staff and patients told @entity23			1
" they should have the best and utmost care than anybody else , even better than a normal civilian , " said @entity33 , whose father , @entity34 , died last month at age 87			0
according to his death certificate , he died of heart failure and @entity4 ' disease			1
@entity33 entered the hospital last month for treatment of dehydration ; the @entity47 veteran initially appeared to be improving , but his condition reversed , his son said			0
the man 's doctors told the family shortly before he died that he had contracted @entity4 '			1
" i mean , they fought for their country , you know , " @entity33 said			0
legionnaires ' disease kills 10 in @entity54 " they go to battle , they love their country and where do they go ? they go to a hospital and they basically die in there			1
" another @entity47 veteran -- @entity64 , 83 , -- died july 18 , 2011 , after being diagnosed with @entity4 ' at the hospital , his daughter @entity63 said			1
though the @entity66 veteran had been living in the hospital for several months after he became unable to live on his own , the hospital said he could not have contracted the bacteria in the hospital			0
when she questioned how that conclusion had been reached , she said she was told , " if he had gotten it here there would have been other cases			0
" " i felt guilty , very guilty , thinking he got it when i took him out the sunday before @entity77 2011 , " @entity63 said			0
the @entity8 's problem extends beyond @entity2			1
this week , it turned off the water in a building at its campus in @entity83 , @entity84 , 30 miles from the facility in @entity2 , said @entity86 , a spokeswoman for the facility			0
the action was taken after @entity90 bacteria were identified in a preliminary sample on tuesday , she said in a statement			0
no cases of @entity4 ' have been identified in the @entity83 facility " as a result of this preliminary finding , " she added			1
the @entity1 would not say if any of the patients known to have been sick with @entity4 at the hospital in @entity2 had died , but it told the @entity99 that one of them did , a health department spokesman said			1
legionnaires ' disease , which is spread through water , is preventable and treatable			2
" being a veteran myself , i 'm shocked and appalled that the @entity8 would put their veterans in that type of situation , " said @entity33			1
according to data collected by the hospital and obtained by @entity23 , hospital water over the past year did not contain enough disinfectant to prevent @entity90 bacteria from reaching dangerous levels			2
records from the company that manufactured the water systems show that , in december 2011 , a site visit noted , " they have legionella " and " systems are not being properly maintained			1
" five months later , the same company -- @entity127 -- concluded that the problems were continuing : " obvious evidence that the systems had not been properly regularly maintained , " the records say			1
" they were not doing the monitoring ; they were not doing the things critical to the efficacy of the system , " said @entity127 chief operating officer @entity131			0
he said his staff alerted hospital officials twice to the deficiency in their maintenance practices			0
but he said there is no evidence that hospital officials fixed the problem and that the deaths " absolutely " could have been prevented had the system been maintained			2
@entity131 's view was shared by @entity149 , an authority on @entity4 ' disease who worked as a microbiologist at the hospital for 23 years			1
" this outbreak was absolutely preventable , " she said			0
@entity149 and her colleague , dr. @entity156 , pioneered the research on the ionization filtration system now used in hospitals nationwide			0
but six years ago , the scientists ' laboratory was closed by the hospital , which described it as " not productive " and " a drain on clinical resources			0
" the researchers , who left the hospital after their lab was shut , dispute that characterization			0
they said that , during the decade before their departure , hospital water had not been linked to a single case of @entity4 '			1
had the laboratory remained at the hospital , the deaths of @entity174 and others could have been prevented with the turn of a knob , @entity149 said			0
" this is not , as they say , rocket science , " she said			0
" a source told @entity23 that , about six months ago , the hospital did bring in a consultant who made recommendations about how to fix the water , but the @entity8 apparently did not tell that consultant that the hospital had had any @entity4 ' cases			1
had the consultant been told , the source said , the consultant 's recommendations to the hospital would have been different			2
the source said it was not clear whether the hospital had followed any of the consultant 's recommendations			2
@entity198 hotel shuts fountain , spa after fatal @entity4 ' outbreak last month , the federal @entity202 sent a team to the @entity8 to investigate and make recommendations			1
their findings are to be issued to the @entity8 in the coming weeks			2
@entity8 spokesman @entity206 would not agree to an interview			2
instead , he released media advisories , one of which concluded : " @entity8 is committed to providing safe facilities and quality care for veterans			1
" it added that an investigation was under way and tests had shown that remediation efforts had proven successful			0
outside his suburban @entity2 home , @entity174 ' flag still flies over his front lawn			0
he would have turned 88 last weekend , but instead of celebrating his birthday , his family held a memorial service			0
he leaves three sons , five grandchildren and a wife of 59 years			0
the family has retained a lawyer and begun the process of filing a claim against the @entity8			2
in the meantime , sen. @entity232 , @entity233 , and other members of @entity235 are calling for a full accounting of the outbreak			0
the disease has long existed , but got its name in 1976 , when an outbreak occurred among people attending an @entity244 convention			0
some 8,000 to 18,000 people are hospitalized with @entity4 ' each year in the @entity246 , according to the @entity202			2
though it proves fatal in 5 % to 30 % of cases , most cases can be treated successfully with antibiotics , the disease agency says			1
people contract the disease when they breathe in droplets of water contaminated with the bacteria , it says			2
hospitals are vulnerable because of their complex water systems , and because many of their patients already have illnesses that could put them at increased risk of infection			1
older people , smokers , people with impaired immune systems or chronic lung disease also tend to be at higher risk , the @entity202 said .			2

*29* cases of @entity4 ' disease have been diagnosed at @entity8 since january 2011
at least 5 of the cases were acquired from the hospital
relatives of two veterans who died after contracting the disease blame the @entity8
records indicate the hospital 's water systems were not properly maintained
