students gathered as the chef sliced tomatoes with a plastic knife in a @entity5 public school cafeteria			2
their eyes followed as she held up a slender green cylinder before the crowd of parents and kids in plastic aprons and hairnets			2
" what 's that ? " kids shouted			2
" it 's a scallion			2
but do n't eat it now , " warned @entity18 , a culinary student and volunteer chef			1
" it does n't taste like celery			1
" @entity18 was helping at @entity23 , a free , six - week class that teaches parents and kids how to shop for and prepare healthy , inexpensive meals			0
the program launched 20 years ago through the nonprofit @entity29 , and it now serves more than 11,000 families across the country			1
most participants use or have used food stamps , free or reduced - price school lunches or food pantries to cover their nutritional needs , and almost all are still looking for ways to stretch a few ingredients into meals			1
the number of families that struggle to get enough food has increased in recent years			1
the @entity45 @entity44 reported that in 2010 , 14.5 % of households in the @entity45 -- about 17.2 million -- lacked the resources to provide enough food for everybody			1
among those , about 6.4 million households saw normal eating patterns disrupted or reduced because there was n't enough food			1
food insecurity -- uncertainty about where the next meal will come from -- is particularly hard on one group : children			1
the nonprofit @entity59 , a network of more than 200 food banks around the @entity45 , reports one in five children are at risk of hunger			1
for children in african - american or @entity69 households , it 's closer to one in three			1
they 're likely to have trouble focusing in school			0
they might experience illness or poor health as a result			0
they 're also likely to struggle with stress at home or in class			0
while many are eligible for free or reduced - price food at school , those programs do n't provide food at night , on weekends or during breaks from school			1
hunger is still a more frequent problem for homes headed by single parents and for homes below the federal poverty line , the @entity44 reports , but it has also crept into homes that have never experienced it before			1
" it 's invasive and real , " said @entity98 , a @entity59 spokeswoman			0
" it 's a time of record need , a time when you 're seeing people from all walks of life needing to turn to assistance to meet their food needs			1
" for adults , the most important step might be talking about it , @entity109 - @entity98 said -- reaching out to friends and family who can help and learning what government and nonprofit food programs are available			1
" at some point , we 're all in need of something , " she said			0
" it 's reflective of a society experiencing a huge downturn			0
it 's not reflective on one individual			0
" for kids , it might mean getting adults more engaged in teaching nutrition and stopping hunger before it starts			0
on tv , a new " @entity133 " puppet , @entity132 , is talking about food insecurity from the perspective of a 7 - year - old who does n't always have enough to eat			1
in @entity141 , @entity142 , chef and restaurateur @entity139 feeds pasta to about 300 children every night			1
@entity139 , one of the @entity145 of 2011 , began cooking for kids when his mother visited from @entity148 and saw a child eating potato chips for dinner			0
the boy , like dozens of others near his restaurant in @entity155 , lived in a motel , where his family had limited access to food and cooking space			1
" ' @entity139 , you must feed them pasta , ' " he recalled her saying			0
@entity139 continued the nightly pasta feast throughout the recession , even as his restaurant struggled			0
" they 're customers , " he told @entity169 earlier this year			0
" and back in @entity5 , it means teaching parents to shop and cook with kids in tow			0
the @entity23 curriculum includes taking families to grocery stores and then getting them into kitchens at schools , community centers or even housing units			1
today 's menu : breakfast burritos with eggs , cheese and homemade salsa			0
the cost : less than $ 2 a serving			0
at @entity192 's first @entity23 class this month , the 25 - year - old mother of three said her kids first told her about the class			0
" i 'm hoping to learn a lot , " she said , as she helped her 4 - year - old daughter , @entity195 , cut a tomato to make salsa			0
" i 'm hoping to learn to cook with my children , because you need patience			2
" while parents will usually be the ones to budget , buy and cook food , getting kids excited about preparing and eating homemade meals can keep everyone engaged in healthier choices and smart shopping			2
@entity210 , the @entity23 program coordinator for @entity211 in @entity212 , said some members of the class rely on food stamps , but it 's designed for anyone with food insecurity -- people who recently lost jobs and have to rethink their food budgets , or families that occasionally seek assistance from food banks			1
it also gets parents and kids spending time together and talking about the food the fuels them			2
" i remember baking with my grandmother , but that does n't happen anymore , " @entity210 said			2
" the reality is parents are busy ; you have some that work two jobs			0
but the kids come here and they are so excited , and they go home excited			0
and that inspires parents to cook with their children			2

millions of @entity45 households do n't have enough food for everyone
the problem is *spreading* to families who have never experienced it before
food insecurity can be especially tough on children , experts say
