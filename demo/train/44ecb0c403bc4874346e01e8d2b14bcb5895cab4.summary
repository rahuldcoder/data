-- about a decade ago , while walking through the spring training clubhouse of the then - @entity3 , a third baseman summoned me toward his locker and -- pants down , while changing out of his uniform -- farted in my face			1
i did not know the man			1
he did not know me			1
he simply thought , in some odd way , that farting into a stranger 's face constituted good humor			1
and , amazingly , it did			1
teammates laughed and laughed and laughed			2
ultimately , a catcher i 'd interviewed before walked up , tapped me on the shoulder and said , " typical bull --- -			2
the professional athlete who breaks wind in a man 's face is not an anomaly			2
neither is the athlete who -- as a joke -- sticks a pornographic film in the clubhouse tv 's dvd player			2
or the one who gives a teammate a wedgie			2
or ... you name it			2
that 's why , as the world -- in and out of sporting -- chatters over the 144 - page report commissioned by the @entity45 to explore allegations of bullying within the @entity48 , i ca n't help but sigh , shrug and accept the reality that -- even with @entity52 's warranted public flogging , even with @entity54 's announcement of his homosexuality , even with continued societal enlightenment -- little will change			1
as anyone who has spent time covering athletics will tell you , life in a male professional clubhouse is often akin to the worst fraternity on campus -- minus the rules , regulations and governing bodies			2
there is a caste system , but it has little to do with the most intelligent and mature rising to the top			2
here , the skinny backup quarterback who attended , say , @entity71 or @entity72 gains no points for his pedigree			0
the strong debater or the @entity78 fan is n't considered a guide or guru			1
no , this is the heartland of @entity82 -- large , loud , oafish dunderheads who would be branded bullies elsewhere but are here leaders			0
as the @entity45 report detailed , @entity87 appeared to take a sadistic pleasure in torturing @entity90 , a teammate considered to be weak			1
@entity91 , a defense lawyer who investigated the scandal and produced the report for the @entity45 , called it " a classic case of bullying , where persons who are in a position of power harass the less powerful " -- and truer words have rarely been written			1
@entity90 was mocked racially , mocked sexually , subjected to obscene jokes about his sister and mother			0
another teammate , according to the report , was besieged with homophobic taunts and touched in a " mockingly suggestive manner			1
this is not particularly surprising			0
truth be told , the world of professional team sports is about as open - minded as a corpse			1
yes , blacks and whites and @entity115 and @entity116 come together to fight for a common goal			0
once the final whistle or buzzer sounds ( or the last out is recorded ) , the " @entity119 " spirit evaporates , and everyone wanders off into their groups and corners			0
many go about their lives			0
some -- the meek -- cower			0
others -- the @entity82 -- pounce			0
they do so for the simple reason that others before them have also done so -- no one dares stand in the way			0
i vividly recall covering the @entity137 when @entity138 was the team 's star			0
he was ( to be blunt ) an awful man to others -- rude to teammates , dismissive to fans , crude to the media and indifferent to @entity137 employees			0
when a @entity148 front office executive or public relations official would tiptoe up to @entity138 with a question or request , he would be unceremoniously rebuffed			0
he might technically have held the power , but @entity138 was bigger , stronger , more famous , more important -- and his way became the way			0
no matter what the so - called experts say on the morning talk shows ( and @entity159 knows , it 'd be helpful if some of them ever even stepped foot inside a locker room ) , that 's how it goes in sports			1
unless pro sports commissioners @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 make a concerted effort to begin enforcing better behavior in their sports ' respective locker rooms , that 's how it will always go in sports			1
and the @entity82 will continue to rule the terrain			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			1

@entity182 : @entity45 report on bullying among @entity48 *horrified* many but should n't
as a *sportswriter* , he says he often saw the immature behavior of players
he says the strong bully the weak , while racism and homophobia are n't uncommon
@entity182 : the *culture* of the locker room will remain unless sports chiefs change it
