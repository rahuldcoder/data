teens are losing some of their rebellious reputation with this news from the federal government			2
the latest monitoring the future survey , released on tuesday by the @entity6 , finds children are smoking fewer cigarettes , drinking less alcohol and abusing fewer prescription and synthetic drugs			1
deadly high : how synthetic drugs are killing kids marijuana rates are stable , even with the increase in the number of states that allow people to use marijuana recreationally			2
some 6.5 % of eighth graders said they had smoked marijuana in the past month , 16.6 % of 10th graders did and 21.2 % of 12th graders had , according to the survey			1
in states with medical marijuana laws , 40 % of 12th graders who reported using marijuana in the past year said they had it contained in food			2
that 's compared to 26 % who said the same in states where the drug is not legal for any kind of use			2
agonized parents plea : beware synthetic drug dangers there has been a decline in the number of children trying synthetic drugs like @entity46 , also known as synthetic marijuana , in the two years the survey has measured this in all three grades			1
use among 12th graders this year was 5.8 % , compared to 7.9 % last year and 11.3 % in 2012 , the survey said			1
there was also a sharp drop in binge drinking among high school seniors , which is now under 20 % , compared to 1998 when binge drinking among high school seniors was at a peak of 31.5 %			2
the number of young adults who have tried e-cigarettes is up , according to this report , but that 's in large part because e-cigarette use has never been measured before by this survey			1
frequent teen marijuana use linked to issues later in life an unrelated study published monday in the journal @entity70 found that 29 % of teens surveyed in @entity72 in 2013 used e-cigarettes , a number much higher than reported in previous surveys			1
the general decline in drug and alcohol use by teens is part of a two - decade long trend among @entity83 teens			1
" the main highlight is that for most indicators the news is very good , " said @entity85 dr. @entity84			2
a research psychiatrist and scientist , @entity84 said she is encouraged by this significant decline , particularly in synthetic drugs and prescription drugs , which had been a growing problem for teens			0
she does n't , however , think parents and teachers should be complacent			0
" we need to continue to be very aggressive as far as interventions and to continue to curb abuse			1
" growing number of calls to poison centers involve kids an increasing number of children have tried e-cigarettes : some 17 % of 12th graders surveyed had used them in the last month			0
sixteen percent of 10th graders did , as had 8 % of eighth graders			0
" if you think about a new device , those rates are very high , " @entity84 said			0
the patterns for other drug use are similar to other surveys			0
researchers have seen a decline over the past five years in use of prescription pain medicine and have n't seen an uptick in use of other drugs like heroin to compensate for the decline			0
the rate of abuse of the painkiller @entity130 , for instance , has dropped significantly from the peak abuse use five years ago , according to @entity84			1
it fell from 9.5 % of those surveyed using it to 4.8 % now			0
" this is quite significant because it is so addictive , " @entity84 said			0
she credited an increase in education campaigns and an increased awareness in the health care system about the abuse for slowing the abuse of these drugs			1
government drug buy - back programs have also had an impact , @entity84 said			0
" we still have a lot of work to do and we can still bring those numbers realistically lower , " @entity84 said			0
compared to other countries , even with the decline in use , the @entity83 still has a higher drug use rate than many other countries			0
" we do n't ( want to ) stand out as a country with high rates of drug abuse among teenagers			1
