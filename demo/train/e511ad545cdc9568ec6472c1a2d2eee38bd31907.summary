-- not too long ago , students had to craft an essay if they wanted to win a scholarship			1
now , they just can craft a tweet			2
the @entity5 is asking eligible high school seniors to tweet a photo that illustrates their commitment to education and enriching their communities			2
the @entity15 colonel 's @entity13 winner , announced december 15 , will receive up to $ 5,000 per year to pursue a bachelor 's degree at a public university in his or her home state			1
@entity15 started the @entity21 contest last year as a way of reinvigorating its scholarship program for the social media age			1
the competition saw over 2,800 applicants , with the winning tweet coming from @entity29 high school senior @entity28 : " # @entity30 hey colonel ! your scholarship 's the secret ingredient missing from my recipe for success ! got the grades , drive , just need cash ! " other organizations , perhaps weary of wading through applicants ' lengthy essays , also are offering eager students ways to turn a 140 - character message into money for college			1
last summer @entity48 awarded a " @entity50 " $ 1,000 cash prize and @entity52 e-readers to three students who tweeted winning answers to questions like , " what would an extra $ 1,000 for college mean to you ? " " no lengthy essay , no pile of paperwork -- just your thoughts , in real time , " promised the contest 's website			2
" to enter , simply log on to @entity21 ... " in place of an essay , the @entity67 's @entity66 offered a full $ 38,000 scholarship to its @entity72 program for the best tweet from a prospective student			1
" that 's right , it 's a 140 - character application that pays $ 271 per letter , " said the school 's website			2
why a tweet ? @entity79 , the @entity67 's director of @entity72 admissions and financial aid , told @entity83 that application essays were " becoming unoriginal			1
" she said " we 're hoping that incorporating social media in the process will help bring back some of that creativity			0
" applicants were encouraged to include in their tweet links to blogs , videos or @entity94 accounts			2
the college plans to bring back the tweeting scholarship next year to international applicants			0
competitions like these are done more for marketing purposes than finding qualified candidates , said @entity102 , a digital - media professor who teaches classes on @entity21 at @entity106			0
he cited a scholarship sponsored by @entity108 that was awarded to a girl who threw the most football passes into a giant @entity108 can at the @entity111			0
" how is that better or worse than @entity21 ? " he asked			0
@entity102 believes these scholarships get buzz because they are " marketing to the extreme			0
" he said he would not be surprised to see more competitions like this in the future , because marketers are very imitative			0
this year 's @entity15 scholarship competition explores students ' creativity in a different way by asking them to tweet a picture instead of just a snippet of text			1
the ideal image should capture their high school experiences and collegiate dreams			0
@entity15 public relations manager @entity129 says snapping pictures and sharing them online comes naturally to this generation of students , and the scholarship is a new way to connect with social - networking teens			1
" @entity136 was a lifelong learner , reinventing himself at the age of 65 when he turned a $ 105 @entity138 check into what would become a global chicken chain			0
he would have been thrilled to see how @entity15 continues to adapt to fit the changing consumer landscape , " @entity129 said			1
@entity129 said @entity15 is watching for new technological trends to help the company decide what to do for next year 's competition			1
in the meantime , students may submit photos until december 13 , and the winner will be named around december 15 .			0
