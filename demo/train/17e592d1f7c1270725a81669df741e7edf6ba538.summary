@entity6 's a big place			1
how do i decide where exactly to go ? to the uninitiated , planning a safari can seem daunting , but it does n't have to be			1
wildlife excursions are largely confined to eastern and southern @entity6 , where the @entity2 ( lions , leopards , rhinos , elephants , and @entity19 buffalos ) converge			1
within those regions , there are some basic rules that help distinguish the kind of experience each country offers			1
on the approachable end of the spectrum , @entity26 and @entity6 are among the easiest - to - navigate nations in @entity6			1
both have well - developed tourism infrastructures with accessible parks , plush lodges , and plenty of flights and outfitted trips , so safaris there tend to be simple to arrange and comparatively cheap			1
on the more adventurous side , @entity38 and @entity39 in the east and @entity41 and @entity42 in the south offer more rugged , unique experiences and fewer crowds , although generally at a higher price			2
once you decide which type of adventure you 'd prefer , it seriously helps to zero in on specific trips by tapping a safari - savvy travel agent			1
@entity55 has a robust database that lists hundreds of travel agencies , and it allows you to search specifically for safari specialists			1
26 stunning @entity60 photos how much can i expect to pay ? regardless of how you do it , safaris do n't come cheap			2
a weeklong trip is typically at least $ 4,000 : guided safaris start at roughly $ 250 per person per day -- and that 's before you 've paid for airfare to @entity6			1
international flights are n't usually included in safari packages and typically cost $ 2,000 or so			1
that said , there are some strategies that help keep prices relatively low			0
booking your initial flight through an @entity6 - focused ticket consolidator , such as @entity80 or @entity81 ( 800/228 - 2208 ) can save you up to 30 percent			1
also , if you do n't mind a little rain , you can cut the cost of lodging in half by traveling during the wet season , from november to march			0
the @entity87 in @entity26 's @entity89 reserve , for instance , charges $ 260 for a double room in early december and $ 600 for that same room during the peak july -- october period			1
also , storms are brief and usually limited to the afternoon			0
" personally , i think you 're missing out if you never see a rain shower in @entity6 -- they 're spectacular , " says @entity95 , a biologist and researcher at the @entity98 who also guides custom safaris for his company , @entity100			1
" the worst that happens is you get a little wet and wind up spending a few hours indoors watching a powerful display of @entity107			0
" 17 breathtaking @entity108 finally , make sure to read the fine print			0
much like an ocean cruise , a safari with a higher price tag may end up being cheaper than one that costs less up front but requires paying extra for one - off experiences as you go			1
upgrades such as traveling in a private group , visiting private game reserves , and hopping around on charter planes will quickly ratchet up costs , sometimes to the tune of $ 1,000 a day			0
and those splurges do n't always pay off : " you do n't necessarily get better wildlife experiences by spending lots of money , " given says			0
" at some point , the steep rates are because the lodge has a spa and you 're eating gourmet , six - course meals			1
" 15 places every kid should see before 15 how do i find a good outfitter ? bottom line : it 's all about your guide			1
" that person will absolutely make or break your trip , " says @entity143 , who chronicled his own adventures in " whatever you do , do n't run : true tales of a @entity150			0
" " a good guide will not only point out where the lions are , but will also teach you how to listen to calls , follow tracks , and spot that lion tail in a field of tall grass			0
" @entity160 recommends looking for outfitters that specifically tout the expertise of their trip leaders			0
@entity166 's the @entity165 , which lists descriptions of 24 reliable agencies , is a good place to start			2
when you speak to the company representatives , do n't hesitate to ask about the strength of individual guides , and be sure to request references			0
finally , because animals move based on migratory and weather patterns , a good safari operator will adjust itineraries throughout the year to maximize wildlife sightings			2
consider it a red flag if a company offers the exact same trips year - round			2
@entity185 any other general tips ? focus on the experience , not your photo album			1
if your head is behind a lens the whole time , you may not be able to take in the bigger picture			0
also , do n't have unrealistic expectations about the number of animals you 'll see			0
" some novices expect every plain to be carpeted with cheetahs chasing gazelles , " @entity160 says			0
you 're not on a @entity203 show ; it 's a vacation			2
so keep an open mind and remember that every animal has its charms , from warthogs ( " possibly the only animal that looks better from the back than the front , " @entity160 says ) to zebras ( " no less fantastic - looking than unicorns " )			2
@entity214 : the @entity215 in the @entity216 do blend in			0
now is not the time for tie - dye			2
stick to muted brown , khaki , and light green clothes when spotting wildlife			0
that said ... do n't wear camo			0
in @entity6 , it 's associated with the military -- often negatively			1
you 're a tourist , not @entity228			0
do pack soft - sided luggage			2
hard - shell bags are typically packed at the bottom of the pile in buses and @entity234 , and they 're the last to be unloaded			2
do n't wear cologne or perfume			0
the animals will smell you from miles away and keep their distance			0
@entity241 has its place -- but it 's not on safari			1
by the @entity244 8,000 approximate number of wildebeests born each day in @entity38 's @entity247 , from december through march 29 number of elephants per square mile at @entity41 's @entity250 -- some 120,000 in all @entity251 , in square miles , of @entity38 's @entity253 , @entity6 's largest national park ( about the same area as 19 @entity255 ! ) get the best travel deals and tips emailed to you @entity258 ! copyright Â© 2010 @entity260 , all rights reserved .			1
