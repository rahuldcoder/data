-- the decisive and positive terms of @entity3 's response to monday 's " declaration " in @entity5 by the @entity7 group is to be welcomed , as is the response of the @entity10 government and others			1
it has taken many years of patient work to get to this point and every effort must be made to build momentum into the process			0
i first became involved in the efforts to build a peace process in the @entity22 country at the time of our own peace agreement in 1998			1
an @entity27 priest , @entity28 @entity26 , who i have known for almost 40 years , had played a key role in creating the @entity27 peace process and he was asked by a priest in that region to bring his expertise to bear			1
in the years since then , @entity34 © in leaders , including myself , have traveled regularly to the region and met representatives from the @entity22 country and the @entity10 state			1
it is obvious that many of those in the @entity22 region who we met are committed to peace and that they have consciously sought to learn from the @entity27 experience			1
almost two years ago a new group @entity48 , which includes the banned @entity50 party agreed on a new political strategy for progress			1
for those familiar with the peace process in @entity27 the language used by @entity48 is strikingly similar to that used in @entity27			1
@entity48 committed itself to using " exclusively political and democratic means " to advance its political objectives			2
and it seeks to advance political change " in a complete absence of violence and without interference " and " conducted in accordance with the @entity64			2
" these principles were devised by former @entity67 sen. @entity66 who was chair of the peace negotiations in @entity27			1
last monday i returned to @entity5 in @entity22 for an " international conference to promote the resolution of the conflict in the @entity22			2
" an international group of leaders -- myself , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , and @entity79 -- had been asked to speak on that issue and to set out our view of the next steps needed to encourage a step change in the @entity22 peace process			1
in my contribution i pointed out that violence usually occurs when people believe there is no alternative			1
transforming a situation from conflict to peace requires creating an alternative			2
it demands that we seek to understand what motivates , what inspires , what drives our opponent			0
each conflict is different but in the course of our efforts @entity103 learned that there are general principles of peace - making and methods of conflict - resolution that can be applied elsewhere and which can help end conflict if applied properly			2
these elements include : dialogue , tackling the causes which lie at the heart of the conflict , a good faith engagement by all sides , an inclusive process with all parties treated as equals and mandates respected			0
all issues must be on the agenda -- there can be no pre-conditions , no vetoes , and no attempt to pre-determine the outcome or preclude any outcome			0
and there should be time frames			0
most importantly , participants must stay focused and be prepared to take risks and engage in initiatives and confidence - building measures			0
but if there is a starting point , it must be dialogue			0
i emphasized this again and again			0
this is the foundation upon which any progress will be built			0
following our deliberations the @entity145 expressed the opinion that " it is possible to end , the last armed confrontation in @entity151 "			0
we called upon @entity3 to " make a public declaration of the definitive cessation of all armed action and to request talks with the governments of @entity10 and @entity157 to address exclusively the consequences of the conflict			1
" thursday 's statement meets that requirement			2
the @entity10 government has also welcomed the statement			0
so , a breakthrough has been achieved , but it must be built upon quickly if its potential is to be achieved			0
the next steps should now focus on promoting reconciliation , addressing the issue of victims and recognizing that a serious effort has to be made to heal personal and social wounds			0
there are other issues which will need to be addressed and which can act as confidence - building measures within the process			0
for example , among these are the issue of prisoners and of demilitarizing the environment and of respecting and acknowledging the democratic rights of all political parties and treating them as equals			0
and there is for the @entity22 people the key issue of the right of the people of that historic region to self - determination			1
as we learned from our own experience , making peace is very difficult			2
but as the peace processes in @entity27 and in @entity196 demonstrate , no conflict is intractable			1
if there is political will and imagination and a preparedness to take risks for peace it is possible to rewrite the script , make progress and achieve agreements			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			2

@entity22 *separatist* group @entity3 said thursday it is laying down its arms
@entity209 says there are key lessons from @entity27 's experience with *peacemaking*
he says violence usually occurs when people believe there is no alternative
@entity209 : political will , imagination and courage can make peace possible
