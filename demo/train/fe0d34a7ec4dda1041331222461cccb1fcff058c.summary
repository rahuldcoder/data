-- when an earthquake hit @entity3 in 2010 a quarter of a million people lost their lives , homes were flattened and communities torn apart			1
the capital @entity8 became a sea of devastation in which shelter was hard to find			0
those affected flocked to find safe ground			0
amid the chaos , the @entity16 stadium became a makeshift refuge for those hordes rendered homeless by the disaster			0
thousands poured through the gates at the national home of soccer , seeking sanctuary on turf that usually only plays the role of host for 90 minutes at a time			1
a year on from the disaster some 7,000 people still live in and around the stadium , a grim reality replicated on nearly every green space in the rubble - strewn city			1
but slowly , soccer -- like the community it represents -- is starting to reassert itself			1
the scene is still far from normal as helicopters laden with medical supplies use the pitch -- once the preserve of players only -- to land and take off from			0
for the man charged with trying to rebuild the country 's decimated football community , it provides yet another challenge to etch onto an exhausting list			1
@entity3 's @entity50 ( @entity52 ) president , @entity51 , recalls how the earthquake that brought the country to its knees spared nothing for the beautiful game			1
" our national headquarters collapsed in just a few seconds , " he told @entity0			2
" of the 50 people present at the time of the earthquake one dozen were injured and 32 found dead			1
" we also lost inventories of national equipment ; the federation 's archives were not recovered			1
our trophies , the awards we have received throughout the history of the federation , pictures of witnesses of our glorious years were not found in the rubble			2
it was a complete disaster			0
" on top of it all , right after the earthquake all fields were occupied by millions of refugees of the earthquake who had lost everything			2
currently we no longer have any soccer field that we can use in @entity8 and surrounding towns for a decent game			2
" this represents a big problem for the country , whose passion for football is described by soccer 's governing body @entity92 as " amongst the most intense on the planet			1
" yet despite the infinite challenges , the @entity52 have worked tirelessly to get soccer back on its feet and were still able to launch their domestic league and cup tournaments , if a little later than advertised			2
just two months after the tragedy , and despite losing their coach @entity104 to the earthquake , @entity3 's under - 17 women 's team competed in a qualifying tournament for the @entity107			1
this courage of purpose saw the team given @entity92 's @entity112 award at a recent ceremony , where the team captain , @entity114 , summed up the country 's feeling towards soccer when she told the audience : " if there was no football , we would be nothing			1
" it is this enthusiasm that has been the catalyst for recovery according to many , allied with offers of assistance from the likes of @entity128 , the @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133			0
@entity135 star and @entity136 international @entity134 felt moved to visit the country to support the @entity139 charity , founded by his friend , hip hop star @entity140			2
the @entity142 midfielder was stunned by what he saw			0
" we went to @entity8 and it was chaos , " he said			0
" people were trying to rebuild their lives but there was no water , no electricity			0
some of the first tent camps on the road from the airport had already been destroyed by the wind			0
" i wondered how they could live in such difficult conditions			0
but when you spoke to people you could feel that , no matter what happens , they were still positive and they still believed in life			0
" for @entity134 , @entity3 's love for soccer remains despite the crisis : " i 'd say football must be their second religion			1
they know everything about football			2
that 's the power of football			1
it 's all about joy and passion , and it lets them forget their problems			2
" @entity92 have been at the forefront of the international aid effort , donating $ 3.25 million , and its president , @entity184 , told @entity0 : " one year after the earthquake , we have not forgotten about @entity3 and we are still committed to supporting them			1
" we know that football remains a contributor to the positive spirit of many youngsters in @entity3 , and that it can bring some hope for them in these difficult times			1
" the tragedy galvanized the international football community and help flooded in from companies such as @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity202 television station @entity201			2
plans to bring the crumbling @entity16 stadium back up to scratch are in motion and construction of a new headquarters for the @entity52 has already begun			2
once completed it will be a particularly poignant reminder of dr @entity51 's colleagues who were entombed in the previous @entity52 hub			0
" we held a memorial service for our colleagues who did not make it in april on the site of our collapsed headquarters , an extremely moving ceremony , " he explained			0
" on our new website as well as our new headquarters we will have a special place dedicated to their memory , but we know it will never be enough to demonstrate our gratitude for all that they have done for soccer			1
" the @entity52 has n't replaced any of those who were lost , and now operates with a threadbare staff , but thanks to help from around the world dr @entity51 says the future is dominated by hope			0
" overall , we would say that it is thanks to all the 208 associations of @entity92 , who showed us their support and affection that we never felt alone throughout this long journey			1
" since 2003 we 've been going from one catastrophe to the next			0
personally , i never imagined that there was so much solidarity in our family , such a passion to get back on track , everyday i see that the courage and the willpower is getting stronger and stronger			0
" what we are most satisfied with is being able to keep doing of all our activities just like before the quake			0
we are extremely proud of being able to get back up and handling every situation going on in our country			0
" @entity3 never really had much except for talent and the passion for soccer			1
