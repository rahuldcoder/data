hornets have killed dozens of people in @entity2 and injured more than 1,500 with their powerful venomous sting			1
the @entity4 , known scientifically as @entity4 , carries a venom that destroys red blood cells , which can result in kidney failure and death , said @entity9 , an entomologist at the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12			1
but perhaps a bigger problem than the toxicity of the venom is allergy , @entity9 says			2
some people are naturally more allergic to stinging insects than others ; a sting can trigger a deadly anaphylactic reaction , which may involve airway closure or cardiac arrest			1
since july , hornet attacks have killed 42 people and injured 1,675 people in three cities in @entity29 province , according to the local government			1
among those attacked , 206 are receiving treatment in hospitals			2
what are these hornets ? in person , the @entity4 , which is the largest hornet species in the world , looks like " the wasp analog of a pit bull " with " a face that looks like you just ca n't reason with it , " said @entity44 , professor of entomology at @entity46 in @entity47			1
these hornets are found throughout @entity49 and @entity50 , in countries such as in @entity2 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			1
the giant hornet extends about 3.5 to 3.9 centimeters in length ( 1.4 to 1.5 inches ) , roughly the size of a human thumb , and it has black tooth used for burrowing , according to an animal database at the @entity63			1
the queens are even bigger , with bodies that can grow longer than 5 centimeters ( 2 inches )			2
the species feed their young the larvae of other insects and use their mandibles to sever the limbs and heads of their prey			2
the giant hornets are attracted to human sweat , alcohol and sweet flavors and smells			1
they are especially sensitive to when animals or people run , according to @entity82			1
every breeding season , the giant hornets produce an average of 1,000 to 2,000 offspring , @entity9 said			2
they feast on other insects such as wasps and bees , launching coordinated attacks on the hives of their prey			0
most hornet hives or nests are tucked away in secluded places , such as tree hollows or even underground			1
" it 's very difficult to prevent the attacks , because hornet nests are usually in hidden sites , " said @entity96 , director general of the @entity97 in @entity53			1
@entity103 giant hornets and other terrifying creatures what is the human impact ? over the summer and early fall , hornets have invaded schools full of children and descended upon unsuspecting farm workers in @entity2			1
one of them is @entity113 , who was attacked in @entity115 while looking after her millet crop			0
" the hornets were horrifying , " she told @entity82 , the @entity2 state - run news agency			1
" they hit right at my head and covered my legs			0
all of a sudden , i was stung , and i could n't move			1
" even now , my legs are covered with sting holes			0
" two months , 13 dialysis treatments and 200 stitches later , @entity124 still remains hospitalized and unable to move her legs			0
@entity96 , who specializes in entomology , warned that the sting from an asian giant hornet was severe compared with those of other insects			2
the influx of venom to the human body can cause allergic reactions and multiple organ failure , leading to death			1
patients like @entity124 have been receiving dialysis to remove the toxins from their bodies			0
in photos , patients bore deep , dark craters scattered across their limbs , the size of bullet wounds			0
dr. @entity148 , director of the intensive care unit at @entity150 of @entity151 and an expert of the provincial hornet sting treatment guidance unit , warned in a @entity29 government release that hornets tend to be aggressive and more active during september and october , their breeding season			1
the hornets do not go into hibernation until december , according to local government authorities			0
local authorities have deployed thousands of police officers and locals to destroy the hives			0
about 710 hives have been removed and at least 7 million yuan ( about $ 1.1 million @entity165 ) sent to areas affected by hornets , according to a government press release			0
why so many attacks now ? the spate of attacks could be caused by the unusually dry weather in the area , authorities say			1
the arid environment makes it easier for hornets to breed			0
urbanization could also be a contributing factor , as humans move into hornets ' habitats			0
some experts cited in @entity82 stated additional factors such as increased vegetation and a decrease in the hornets ' enemies , such as spiders and birds , because of ecological changes			2
in other words , it 's a good season for the hornet population , which makes it a bad season for people who encounter them			1
the provincial government of @entity29 has warned residents to wear long sleeves when outdoors and not to attempt to drive the swarms away or remove the hives			1
@entity53 is familiar with asian giant hornet stings , too			1
about 30 to 50 deaths are reported each year in @entity53 from such attacks , according to @entity53 studies			1
most of the deaths are due to allergies to the venom , @entity96 said			0
the giant hornets are also destructive to western honeybees			2
research in @entity53 suggests that tens of thousands of honeybee hives are damaged by the giant hornets each year			1
how to protect yourself people run into trouble when these hornets form a nest : a basketball - shaped nest that looks like it 's made of gray paper , sometimes under an eave , @entity9 said			2
if you disturb one of these , or happen to whack a tree that has a nest in it , the hornets may respond as if they 're under attack			0
humans can get themselves in danger by reacting poorly to these large hornets			0
if you see a nest or a hive , just avoid it , @entity9 says			0
if one of them buzzes around you , do n't panic			0
" do n't flap or scream or freak out , " he advised			0
" just calmly walk away			0
" one victim told local media this month that " the more you run , the more they want to chase you			0
" some victims described being chased about 200 meters ( 656 feet ) by a swarm			0
an area of research that has n't been explored is how many people get stung by these hornets while taking down a nest in order to use the larvae as fish bait , or even to eat			1
the larvae do not have venom , @entity9 explained			0
but in general , people should not tamper with these nests			2
as powerful as their sting can be , it is highly unlikely that these hornets would travel all the way to the @entity165 to find a new home , @entity9 said , or in the @entity258 for that matter			0
to go to @entity261 , they 'd have to cross some " nasty deserts " to which they are not adapted			0
as deadly as live adult giant hornets can be , some people do n't shy away from them altogether			2
there is a sports drink in @entity53 called @entity268 that incorporates amino acids derived from hornets			1
in @entity271 , where the giant hornet is known as the " tiger head , " the insect is sometimes used in alcoholic drinks , @entity44 said , the idea being that " the essence of this great big strong hornet will go out into the booze , and when you drink it , you 'll become strong			2
" that 's one way to get a buzz .			0

hornet stings have killed 42 people and injured 1,675 in @entity2 since july
@entity29 province sees unusual level of activity ; dry weather , human moves are factors
people who have been stung are dying from allergic reactions or multiple organ failure
type of hornet is also a threat to honeybees , often seen in @entity53
