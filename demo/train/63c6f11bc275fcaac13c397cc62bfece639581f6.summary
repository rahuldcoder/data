@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 experienced many hardships growing up in @entity5 , @entity6 , during the 1930s and ' 40s			1
her family 's first house had no lights or running water			2
but even during tough times , she and her twin sister , @entity13 , were taught to be selfless			2
" my daddy taught us not to take the last piece of bread from the table ; somebody may come by that 's hungry , " @entity15 remembered			2
since 1986 , @entity15 has been leaving a whole lot more than bread on the table			1
as the founder of the @entity28 in @entity0 , @entity1 , she has helped serve more than 1 million free meals to those in need			1
aided by her sister and a team of volunteers , @entity15 serves those whom she calls the five hs : the hungry , the homeless , the helpless , the hopeless and the homebound			0
" we have so many people that are in need , " said @entity15 , 83			1
" that 's what keeps us going			0
" the @entity28 prepares and distributes about 2,000 meals a week from a large community center that 's equipped with a restaurant - style kitchen			1
on wednesdays and thursdays , the @entity28 serves a lunchtime meal where everyone is welcome			1
hundreds often dine in , but the majority of meals -- 1,500 on average -- are delivered to @entity0 residents who can not physically leave their homes			1
many of these people are elderly and suffer from debilitating illnesses or diseases			1
" each week , we get a list of people that are either hospitalized , too old to come in to eat , or homebound , " volunteer @entity61 said			1
" then on thursday , they take a stack of these seven meals , and the volunteers deliver to that person			1
" each takeout box has an entr√©e , a vegetable , bread and dessert so recipients receive well - rounded meals for a whole week			2
but they also get much more			0
" it feeds their body , and it also feeds their soul , " @entity61 said			1
" they have somebody that comes and talks to them , gives them some encouragement			0
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2011 @entity91 @entity15 does n't typically deliver the meals herself			1
she and her sister stay at the community center , greeting volunteers , recipients and even fans who drop by to say hello			0
" my sister @entity13 is a blessing to me , " @entity15 said			0
" she always says the @entity28 was in the making			1
and that 's why the @entity103 sent two : because it 's so much work to do for one			0
" the two enrolled in nursing school in the late ' 50s , and after graduation , they began working at what is now the @entity109			0
at the time , @entity15 said , segregation was in " full force			0
" she saw many of her black patients struggle for food and transportation			0
" they did n't have money , " @entity15 said			2
" they did n't have transportation home			2
the @entity103 put it into my brain for me to do something about this			0
" @entity15 said she used her own funds when she could to help those in need			0
however , she dreamed of a place " where people could come and eat and would n't have to pay anything			1
" in 1986 , that dream became reality when the pastor of a nearby church said she could set up shop in the basement			2
the first day the @entity28 opened its doors , it served 22 meals			1
" i think our first meal was fried chicken with some fried potatoes and a little salad on the side , " said @entity142 , 66 , who has been coming to the @entity28 since it started			1
the number of recipients grew over time , as did the venue size			0
but more than two decades later , there 's still down - home @entity154 cooking and some good old - fashioned @entity154 hospitality			0
" you leave with love and some higher spirits when you talk to these two ladies here , " @entity142 said			2
the @entity28 's food is donated by an area grocery store			1
local farmers and specialty shops also bring in fresh vegetables , fruit and baked goods			0
meals are served fresh in a kitchen that is up to @entity171 standards			2
volunteers range in age , and many are local professionals who have been inspired by @entity15 's vision and work			0
@entity15 gives all the credit to @entity178 and her wonderful parents			0
her motto remains the same as the day they opened their doors			0
" we work for what we got , and we share what we get , " she said			0
