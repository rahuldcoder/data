i do n't trust cops and i do n't know many black people who do			1
i am appreciative of the work they do			0
but when you 've been pulled over for no good reason as many times as i have ; when you 've been in handcuffs for no good reason as many times as i have ; when you run out to buy some allergy medication and upon returning home , find yourself surrounded by four squad cars with flashing lights and all you can think about is how not to get shot , you learn not to trust cops			1
the first instance of injustice surrounding the @entity21 tragedy occurred february 26 , the night @entity22 decided to pursue , confront and ultimately shoot and kill @entity21			1
the second started the moment the @entity26 police failed to properly investigate what , given the 911 tapes , is clearly a questionable claim of self - defense made by @entity22			0
but seeing that @entity21 's parents were forced to sue the police department just to hear the tapes , it seems as if @entity22 is n't the only questionable component in this case			1
thursday , @entity26 police chief @entity37 stepped down " temporarily			0
" on wednesday , @entity26 city commissioners had voted " no confidence " in him			0
opinion : what every black mother fears but at a town hall meeting hosted by the @entity45 on tuesday , @entity26 's black residents said they lost confidence in the police long before because of the extensive history of prejudicial treatment in the area			1
law enforcement is n't easy			0
in fact , it is extremely dangerous			0
but that in no way excuses improper procedure and lies			0
and given the amount of effort put forth by the @entity26 chief to exonerate @entity22 , a volunteer neighborhood watchman with a history of 911 calls that suggests paranoia , versus efforts to find out the truth , it sure feels like another case of racial profiling and police trying to cover up an impropriety			1
the shooter may not have been a police officer , but the story of how the police handled this case is oh - so - familiar			1
it 's the same story the nation heard from blacks in @entity77 surrounding the 1991 @entity79 beating			1
it 's the same story heard from blacks in @entity82 surrounding the murder of @entity84 , who was only carrying his wallet when he was shot 41 times by four plainclothes policemen in 1999			1
opinion : how " duty to retreat " became " stand your ground " that same story was heard in @entity93 , where black men were shot and killed for sport by police officers off the @entity97 in 2005			2
the police department covered it up for two years before any arrests were made			0
charges were even initially dismissed by the district judge before the @entity103 got involved and finally , last summer , officers were convicted			0
and people wonder where the impetus behind @entity108 's " _ _ _ the police " came from			2
i 'll tell you where it came from			0
it came from knowing there are far more stories like @entity21 's that the world never hears about			1
in fact , we almost did n't hear about this one			0
the nation heard the 911 tapes from last month 's tragic shooting at @entity121 in @entity122 within 24 hours of the incident			2
@entity21 's parents had to file a lawsuit before they could hear the ones in this case			1
why ? if the police department had done everything it was supposed to do , if it was truly " prohibited from making an arrest based on the facts and circumstances they had at the time " as the letter released by the city manager states , then why hold back until there is national media attention ? opinion : killing shows flaws of @entity145 - backed law the letter said the department was still investigating the case and did n't want to compromise it , but the authorities never brought @entity22 in for questioning			1
they tested @entity21 's body for drugs and alcohol , but not @entity22 's			1
the only person with a weapon was zimmerman			0
just like the victims in @entity93 , @entity159 , @entity79			2
... in 2010 , the family of @entity161 was awarded $ 7 million by the city of @entity82 after five police officers sprayed his car with more than 50 bullets , killing him			2
he was unarmed and to be married the next day			0
" no amount of money can provide closure , no amount of money can make up for the pain , " his fiancee , @entity161 , said after the ruling			2
" we 'll just try to learn how to live with it and move on			0
" those are words members of the black community have to say to each other far too many times when it comes to treatment by the police .			2

@entity184 says he 's been *repeatedly* stopped , *hassled* by police for no good reason
he says @entity21 's shooting shows similar injustice
he says it has *echoes* of how police handled @entity84 case , @entity79 , @entity161
@entity197 : cover ups , *lax* investigations show black people why they ca n't trust police
