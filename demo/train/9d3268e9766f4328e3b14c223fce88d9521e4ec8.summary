@entity0 -- the @entity2 confiscated a potent drug commonly used in lethal injections from a state correctional facility cache			0
@entity6 @entity8 spokeswoman @entity7 said the department contacted the dea about its management of sodium thiopental , a powerful sedative			1
" the department requested assistance from the @entity2 to ensure our handling of controlled substances is in compliance , " she said in a statement			0
" because this is an ongoing regulatory matter , we will reserve further comment until the review is complete			0
" @entity1 did not receive a reply to an inquiry on how the correctional facility obtained the drug			0
the @entity2 seized " a quantity " of sodium thiopental tuesday , and is now actively investigating the matter , spokesman @entity28 said			2
" as such , @entity2 is currently working with the @entity6 @entity8 to ensure that they are in compliance with federal regulations , " @entity28 said			0
states that carry out lethal injections during death - row executions have historically administered a three - drug cocktail to carry out the process			1
sodium thiopental is typically injected first to act as a sedative ; the second drug paralyzes the inmate ; the last stops the heart			1
@entity47 , the only domestic manufacturer of sodium thiopental , stopped producing the drug in august 2009 because of a shortage of raw materials , a company spokesman said in december			1
the @entity53 - based pharmaceutical company has said for years that it does n't support the use of the sedative in lethal injections			1
" sodium thiopental was only made for medical use and to improve patients ' lives , " @entity47 spokesman @entity55 said			2
the drug , sold under the name @entity60 , was intended to be made at the company 's plant in @entity64			2
but due to concerns with @entity64 authorities on the use of the drug in capital punishment procedures in the @entity70 , @entity47 announced in january it would stop producing sodium thiopental completely			2
" @entity64 's intent is that we control the product all the way to the ultimate end user to prevent use in capital punishment , " @entity47 said in a statement			0
" based on this understanding , we can not take the risk that we will be held liable by the @entity64 authorities if the product is diverted for use in capital punishment			0
exposing our employees or facilities to liability is not a risk we are prepared to take			0
" the resulting shortage of sodium thiopental prompted 13 states to appeal to the @entity91 in a letter early this year to question how the sedative could be obtained elsewhere , and whether the federal government would allocate some of its own supplies			1
" sodium thiopental is in very short supply worldwide and , for various reasons , essentially unavailable on the open market , " the letter said			1
" for those jurisdictions that have the drug available , their supplies are very small -- measured in a handful of doses			0
the result is that many jurisdictions shortly will be unable to perform executions in cases where appeals have been exhausted and governors have signed death warrants			2
" therefore , we solicit your assistance in either identifying an appropriate source for sodium thiopental or making supplies held by the federal government available to the states , " the letter said			1
some states have been substituting other chemicals			0
wednesday , the @entity124 approved the use of pentobarbital on death row inmates , a powerful anesthetic more commonly used to euthanize animals			2
@entity130 is already being used by prison systems in @entity132 and @entity133 , spurring controversy			0
in december , the 10th @entity135 allowed the substitution of sodium thiopental with pentobarbital in the execution of @entity132 death row inmate @entity140 despite claims from his lawyers that pentobarbital was risky and unproven on humans			1
the court replied in an order , " according to the record , sodium thiopental is now effectively unobtainable anywhere in the @entity70 , thus requiring @entity132 and other death - penalty states to revise their lethal injection protocols			1

powerful sedative used in death - row executions now in short supply
