-- my mother was no domestic goddess			2
she was a golfing , blackjack - playing , martini - drinking sort who had little to do with cooking , sewing , or , @entity9 forbid , " crafts			1
" throughout my childhood , we ate @entity14 dinner at the golf club			2
this was essentially my parents ' place of worship			0
both my sister and i were eventually married there , and we recently scattered my mother 's ashes on the ninth hole			1
the best thing about @entity14 at the club , as far as i was concerned , was the magnificent centerpieces the staff assembled : towering assemblages of nuts , fruit , chocolates , and candles in the shape of @entity36 children that made my sister and me twitch with acquisitive longing			2
@entity0 : upgrade your @entity14 table settings once i left home , i did things rather differently			1
starting at the age of 19 , i cooked myself silly every @entity14			2
even during my vegetarian years , and on through brining and turducken and other frivolities , i compensated for my mother 's uninterest			1
this particular rebellion of mine was just fine with her , as she was widowed early on and happy to have a reason to visit me			0
she would come clear across the country if necessary , always bringing her contribution : the centerpiece , a creation soon known as mr. @entity57			1
mr. @entity57 had a simple red - felt turkey head , with a black - bead eye on either side , and was attached to the butt end of a pineapple with straight pins			1
you laid the fruit on its side so that the leaves took the place of tail feathers and ... ta - da ! faux fowl ! @entity0 : 7 authors share tales of family @entity14 traditions even though the s - shaped seams of the neck were ironed together in the manner of a third - grade art project , i am quite sure my mother did not make the turkey head herself			1
perhaps it was a gift from one of the ladies at the bridge table			0
when an eye fell off , we drew one on with a @entity89			0
and it was charming , in an outsider art - meets - @entity93 kind of way			0
i put it at the center of my table every year , always surrounded by a flock of hand - carved apple swans i had learned how to make in my early 20s from a chef friend			1
@entity0 : the best turkey essentials we found mr. @entity57 's head up in the closet with the wrapping paper after my mother died , its edges rotting slightly from seeping pineapple juice			1
since she has been gone , i somehow feel less like cooking			0
last year i stuck his head on a bottle of @entity114 in the dining room of a nearby hotel			0
i ordered the smoked - salmon appetizer			0
i know my mother would have approved			0
