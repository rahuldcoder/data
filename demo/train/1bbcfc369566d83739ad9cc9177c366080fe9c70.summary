" we want change because @entity3 is poor and @entity2 has done nothing , " said @entity28 , 18 , who voted for @entity4			1
" today we are proud to be @entity3			2
" with 5.3 million voters registered in the country , early turnout was heavy with large crowds waiting to vote in the capital city			0
