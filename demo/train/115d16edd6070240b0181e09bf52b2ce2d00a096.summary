-- " @entity1 , " the 23rd installment in the @entity4 series , one of the longest - running film franchises in history , recently landed at the top of the box office with $ 87.8 million in ticket sales			1
it was the largest opening ever for 007 and the fourth largest opening this year , behind " @entity13 , " " @entity14 , " and " @entity15			0
" @entity17 's agent has always been a man of wish fulfillment			1
after all , he brought heat during the chilliest parts of the @entity21 and had the requisite women and weapons			0
now , @entity4 is proving that he still has a place at @entity25 by tackling a much more modern dilemma : tactical cyberespionage and terrorism			1
while the methods for wreaking havoc have changed , the confidential case files are as classic as the man 's martini			1
@entity0 spoke to @entity34 , a decorated former law enforcement officer who has done work relating to cyberterrorism for the @entity38 , the @entity39 , and the @entity40 about what " @entity1 " gets right and wrong			1
in the end , the evolving franchise portrays a very real scenario that the @entity45 may soon struggle with from a policy standpoint : when does cyberterrorism necessitate a physical response ? busting @entity4 : the myths of movie spycraft ( warning , there are movie spoilers ahead )			1
information storage shaking disbelief : one of the standout moments in " @entity1 " is the film 's opening sequence in which @entity4 , played for the third time by @entity59 , and field operative @entity60 , played by @entity61 , chase a man through the streets of @entity64			1
they 're after a hard drive containing confidential information about @entity25 agents			2
it 's information that " @entity1 's " bad guy @entity70 , played by @entity71 , plans on uploading to @entity72 , putting the agents ' lives at risk			1
but how likely would it be for a terrorist to obtain and store this information in one place ? stirring reality : terrorists and intelligence agencies handle the management and distribution of intelligence in radically different ways , @entity34 said			2
" if you take @entity90 , for example , they 're not going to have big classified systems or safeguards that go with that , " @entity34 said			0
it 's true that after @entity90 's compound was raided , stashes of flash drives , cds and tapes were discovered			2
he had everything in one place			0
" that 's very consistent when you 're not part of the government and you lack the infrastructure to build out a big system that a national security agency does , " @entity34 said			2
" bad guys need everything in one place because that 's how they operate			2
" unlike the 15 different members of the intelligence community -- ranging from the @entity114 to the @entity115 â € ” terrorist groups would be unable to have a secure worldwide network or to participate in cloud computing			0
however , it 's implied that the man they 're chasing is more than your common terrorist			2
he 's a man with access			2
still , it 's unlikely that he would be able to have all of this information in one place			1
" it 's not very plausible that the government is going to put all of their sensitive information on one hard drive that manages to get stolen because that would be a violation of what they call @entity133 , " @entity34 said			1
when it comes to top secret information , there are special access programs that are very restricted , so , @entity34 said , it would be virtually impossible for someone to have access to all of that information as " everything is regulated on the government side			1
" hacking in shaking disbelief : while @entity4 is sipping tequila as everyone assumes he is dead , @entity70 goes after his main target , @entity149 , played once again by @entity150			2
the villain hacks into @entity25 to gain control of the agency 's gas pipeline , which allows him to target and blow up specific rooms			1
the act brings @entity4 out of retirement			0
but would it be possible for a bad guy to hack into @entity25 -- or any infrastructure -- to target it for destruction ? stirring reality : @entity34 said many critical infrastructures are connected to @entity167 systems , controlling our electricity grid , water , and sewers , and are therefore are a huge soft target for terrorism			1
" now you can use it for transmissions of data communications that control everything from power in hospitals to controlling the cell doors inside a prison , " he said , adding that targeting a specific office is highly unlikely			0
transportation safety shaking disbelief : after hacking into the @entity25 mainframe , @entity70 accesses the @entity187 and manages to send one of the @entity187 's trains off the rails , launching it toward @entity4 in rapid succession			1
would it be possible for @entity70 to access something like a train , and how much control could he actually have over it ? stirring reality : " transportation is one of the softest terrorism targets there is , and quite frankly i 'm shocked that public transportation has n't been targeted more often and that there have n't been more successful attacks , " @entity34 said			1
" you can create a small explosion or diversion using a computer to change the lights from go to stop or interfering with the traffic control capabilities of the track by overriding a command			0
airlines could also be at risk , the expert said			2
" there are some gaping holes in the air traffic control system in terms of being able to access frequencies or being able to talk directly to pilots			0
" still , just like @entity149 's office , @entity34 said the idea that @entity70 could target a train so quickly and send it to @entity4 's location is based predominately in fantasy			1
snagging the villain shaking disbelief : when things get really bad , @entity4 and @entity149 decide the time has come to create a digital trail that will lead @entity70 directly to them , but they want to make it look like they 're actually hiding			0
this leads them to the final battle in a place called @entity1 , which fans of @entity17 's books know as a very personal place for @entity4			1
it 's the final showdown and the final act of tactical cyberespionage in the film			1
however , would anyone ever really need to create a fake geosignal to make someone like @entity70 think that they 're actually hiding from them ? stirring reality : according to @entity34 you can create a computer network that looks legitimate to someone else but in reality uses its weakness for your own benefit			0
" there 's actually a term for this in the computer world called ' @entity263 ' , " he said			2
" when we were concerned about the financial sector , there was actually a project called the @entity269 project			0
it was a deception project where we created what appeared to be a bank front end , a web - based front end where transactions were taking place			0
" by doing so , @entity34 and his team were able to see the latest techniques being used and which vulnerabilities cyberterrorists were willing to exploit			0
" we looked at how they went about scanning the system , what tools they used , and what vulnerabilities they went after			0
" often , @entity34 would patch the most obvious vulnerabilities but leave esoteric ones unpatched , allowing hackers to exploit the system as he monitored their behavioral patterns			0
in the movie , @entity290 explains that if he makes it too easy for @entity70 to find them , he 'll know something is up			1
likewise , if the signal is too hard to find , @entity149 could possibly remain in hiding			0
" people tend to get comfortable using their own techniques , and they use the same approach over and over again , " @entity34 explained			0
" you can get a profile of an attacker , determine if it was the same group doing something else , and see what methodology they 're using			0
" @entity34 said it 's a cat - and - mouse game , and " the old saying is that government has to be right 100 % , but the bad guy has only got to be lucky once			0
" in the case of the latest film from the 50 - year - old @entity4 franchise , it 's safe to assume who comes out on top .			1

a cyberterrorism expert takes on " @entity1 's " take on cyberespionage and terrorism
he says accessing top secret information is n't as easy as the movie implies
like in the film , transportation remains a soft target , according to the expert
