" it breaks my heart to think how many people would not have chosen to keep that precious angel			2
" -- @entity6 attorney general @entity5 , speaking about abortion and @entity8 at the 2012 @entity9			1
" i highly approve of ( @entity10 ) @entity12 's decision to be kind and gentle to the retard			1
" -- @entity14 , tweeting about the third presidential debate			1
" no one would call someone with @entity8 ' retard			1
' i call you a ' retard			1
' " -- @entity22 on @entity24 ' @entity23 show			2
let 's pretend that @entity14 is telling the truth in that last comment			1
yes , she called president @entity28 a retard , but at least she claimed she 'd never insult someone with @entity8			1
even if she 's lying , we have come a long way			2
children with @entity8 still get bullied or even abused , and adults with any disability face an uncertain future , particularly in an era of austerity , but today few would call someone with @entity8 a retard to his or her face			1
for this , as the father of a boy with @entity8 , i am grateful			1
in fact , over the last 50 years or so , the lives of people with @entity8 and other disabilities have improved in many remarkable ways			1
most parents are now raising their children with @entity8 in their homes rather than sending them to live in institutions			1
government programs , especially through early intervention and special education , employ teachers and therapists who have helped these children learn beyond our wildest dreams			0
medical advances not only prevent many of the most dire threats to their health but begin to promise new treatments to make it easier for them to learn			0
extended families , churches , community groups and nonprofits all work to support families such as mine			0
and sometimes , when relatives or church members or kind strangers meet my son or hear that i have a boy with @entity8 , they smile and tell me that " people with @entity8 " or " downs kids " are @entity81 's angels sent down to earth			1
i smile and thank them and agree that people with @entity8 can be pretty great			1
but while good intentions count for a lot , " angel " makes me no happier than " retard			2
" most parents who have spent time changing diapers , dealing with tantrums or trying to get a sleepy child , with or without @entity8 , ready for the school bus in time know that " angel " does n't always cut it			1
people talk about @entity8 " special angels " or " hidden angels " across the @entity100 and media			1
@entity105 's @entity104 , an organization that does spectacular work finding homes for orphan children with @entity8 , has an " angel tree " on its website , with pictures of children in need of adoption			1
the founder writes , " the beauty and innocence that a child with @entity8 brings to the world is truly one of @entity122 nature			2
" this is a little more complex than " angel , " but the focus on innocence points in the same direction			0
@entity14 's backward use of the ' r - word ' no human , including my son , is entirely innocent or angelic			1
symbols , labels and representations -- in media , literature and our daily conversations -- shape reality			2
the words " retard " and " angel " represent images that dehumanize and disempower			2
both words connote two - dimensional , simple or limited people			0
neither angels nor retards can live in the world with the rest of us , except as pets , charity cases or abstract sources of inspiration			2
i am delighted to see the tide turn against the " r - word			0
" after @entity22 tweeted about the president , @entity157 , a man with @entity8 , took to the @entity100 and to @entity158			2
he argued that comparing the president to people such as him ought to be a " badge of honor " given the pathways he has forged through life 's complex problems			2
the wave of support and publicity received by @entity157 gives me hope for my son and for all of us who think our lives are improved by a society that includes everybody			0
language changes as knowledge and attitudes change			0
doctors started using the word " retarded " to replace " @entity181			0
" a lot of good came with that shift , because it indicated a new understanding that people with @entity8 were not monstrously limited creatures best locked up in an institution			1
today , we talk about " developmentally delayed , " and a lot of good has come with that shift , too			0
people see a child with developmental delays as having the potential to learn , to grow , to develop and to become a self - advocate			0
and even @entity22 , as a result , claims she would never call my son a retard			1
but other words will replace it			0
people will find new ways to use language to divide , to objectify and to dehumanize			0
the issue is n't language , not specific words , but representation			0
my son is neither angel nor monster , just human			0
it 's true that he 's more confident in the world of empathy than of language			0
he reflects and intensifies the emotions of those around him			0
he meets love with even more love			0
these traits can be wonderful , and they 're pretty typical of people with @entity8			1
but complex emotional lives define us as human , not angelic			0
so let 's listen to the rueful laughs of so many of my fellow parents who insist : " my child is no angel			0
" let 's stand with @entity157 as we fight against hate speech			0
let 's include people with developmental disabilities fully into our society			2
most of all , let 's always think of people with @entity8 as people , first , not syndromes			1
then the cruel words employed by clownish bigots will vanish into historical memory .			0

@entity14 's " retard " comment not aimed at @entity8 , she said
@entity247 has son with @entity8 and says *culture* has come far in accepting disability
he says some call down syndrome kids " angels " but that 's little better than " retards "
@entity247 : we should see humanity of those with @entity8 -- they 're people , not syndromes
