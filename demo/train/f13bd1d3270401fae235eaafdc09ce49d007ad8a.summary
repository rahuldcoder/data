-- @entity2 authorities on friday made contact with a 16 - year - old @entity5 girl who triggered a distress signal while attempting to sail solo around the world			1
but it could be a day before a @entity10 fishing vessel pulls @entity11 and her boat , @entity13 , to shore , the @entity8 said			1
" she 's in the boat			1
it 's not taking on water , and she 's equipped for the conditions down there , we believe , " said @entity16 of the @entity8			2
@entity23 triggered the distress signal thursday during rough seas			1
" she 's been dismasted			2
the rigging 's over the side and in the water , " @entity16 told reporters friday			2
he said @entity31 was in the @entity32 about 2,000 miles southwest of @entity33 , @entity2 , when rescuers contacted her friday			1
" that 's a long way from any merchant shipping , " he said			2
" we 're just fortunate that the @entity10 fishing vessel was in that region			2
" family spokesman @entity41 said @entity23 communicated with rescuers via marina radio			1
" we know that @entity2 search and rescue has contacted her ... and she is alive and well , " @entity41 said early friday morning			1
@entity23 's parents , @entity48 and @entity49 , wrote on her blog : " we have just heard from the @entity51			1
the plane arrived on the scene moments ago			0
@entity31 is upright but her rigging is down			0
the weather conditions are abating			0
radio communication was made and @entity11 reports that she is fine ! " we do n't know much else right now			0
the @entity10 fishing vessel that was diverted to her location will be there in a little over 24 hours			0
where they will take her or how long it will take we do n't know			0
" @entity68 talks about dangers her daughter faces on high seas earlier friday , the @entity8 had taken over the search for @entity23 , noting the stormy seas that prompted her to activate her distress beacons had calmed			1
" the weather is moderating			0
it is improving slightly , " @entity77 of the @entity8 said at the time			0
" now , it 's not perfect , but any improvement in the weather is a positive when you 're looking at a search and rescue operation			0
" @entity23 's vessel is adrift in the middle of the @entity85 some 2,000 miles east of @entity86 , 2,000 miles west of @entity2 and 500 miles north of the @entity87			1
@entity23 's family began scrambling to organize a search - and - rescue effort for her after they learned her emergency beacon was detected just an hour after they last spoke to her on thursday , according to @entity91 , an engineer on her support team			1
the government of @entity95 -- a @entity10 island -- diverted a fishing boat toward her last known position , but it is not expected to reach the area until saturday , @entity91 said			1
an @entity2 military ship , more than two days sail away , has also been dispatched , @entity91 said			1
electronic signals from the boat indicate it is drifting at just a mile per hour , which means it is still afloat but not under sail , @entity91 said			0
@entity107 follows the story @entity23 began her journey from @entity111 , @entity112 , on january 23 with the goal of sailing her 40 - foot boat around the world without stopping			1
mechanical troubles forced her to make two stops for repairs , including at @entity120 , @entity121 , in may			0
she has kept in touch with family and followers through a satellite telephone			0
her website has published frequent blog updates , including one posted wednesday			0
" the last few days have ( been ) pretty busy out here , " @entity11 wrote in her last blog entry			0
" i 've been in some rough weather for awhile with winds steady at 40 - 45 knots with higher gusts			1
with that front passing , the conditions were lighter today			0
" @entity23 is a " very determined " and " very capable sailor , " @entity137 said			2
" she 's pretty much unfazed by most everything , but she had been fatigued by this period of winds which she 's been going through for several days now , " he said			0
when @entity11 's older brother @entity144 sailed around the world alone last year , with stops , he became the youngest person to ever do so at 17			2
@entity148 of the @entity149 , a younger 17 - year - old , took over the distinction weeks later			1
last month , @entity2 @entity153 , days before her 17th birthday , claimed to have become the youngest person to have completed a non-stop , unassisted solo circumnavigation -- a mark held by then 18 - year - old @entity157 of @entity2 since 1999			1
however , sailing journalists have said -- and her team has n't disputed -- that @entity153 's route was less than 21,600 orthodromic nautical miles , which is the length of the equator and the distance generally used for round - the - world sailing records			2
@entity11 has been on a schedule to complete her global journey about two months before her 17th birthday , which is on october 19			0
@entity0 's @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 contributed to this report .			0
