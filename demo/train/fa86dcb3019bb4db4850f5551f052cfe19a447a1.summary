-- @entity1 has nice hands , and he knows it			1
he 's fussy about moisturizing them and takes extra caution around the oven , although he uses power tools without hesitation			0
these hands are the stars of " the @entity11 , " a piece of performance theater about how various people 's hands have become impaired and what effect that 's had on them , both practically and psychologically			1
it 's a collaboration between @entity1 and neuroscientist dr. @entity18 , and supported by the @entity19			1
" i mix up performance and lecture and basically talk about human stories , " @entity1 says			1
" it just happens that i 'm using my hand as a vehicle , but really i 'm talking about what it is to be human			0
" in the show , which he hopes to perform again this year , he talks about various people who have lost complete use of their hands and demonstrates to the audience , through his own body 's movements , what these people 's lives are like			2
" i am looking for that unique balance between science and art , so that medial practitioners and researchers learn something about the work they are doing from a new perspective , without feeling that the performance is ' not for them , ' @entity1 said			1
" and that the art audience in turn learn something about their very structure , of what it takes to be a human without confusing them with science			0
" in october at @entity57 , a gathering of notable researchers , thinkers and other professionals in the health care space , @entity1 performed a few powerful segments of " the @entity11			1
" for one portion he takes on the movements of @entity66 , a woman who injured her spine when she dove into a swimming pool , glided across it and hit the wall			0
@entity71 broke her neck , and is quadriplegic as a result			0
@entity71 received bionic hand technology called the @entity75 , which involves electrodes under her skin connected to a receiver driven by a radio transmitter on the skin			0
in this way , moving her shoulder backwards and forwards makes her hand open and close			0
@entity18 wrote about @entity71 in a book called " @entity86 : narratives of @entity88			2
" " she can hold her fork herself or a brush and brush her hair , and that 's what gives her what she desires the most , and that 's independence , " @entity1 says			2
@entity1 and @entity18 met after @entity1 saw the neuroscientist 's documentary about a man who can not sense the relative position of his own joints and limbs			1
the pair worked together on a piece called " @entity104 , " which deals with experiences of people who are paralyzed , or for whom movement is difficult			2
recognizing @entity1 's " extraordinary hands " and artistic talent , it made sense for @entity18 to focus on that for their subsequent collaboration			1
" human hand function really reflects the evolution of the movement and creative [ areas of the ] brain , and one way to reflect on how we are defined by our hands is to look at the consequences of loss of function , " @entity18 told @entity0			2
" so our next project had to be about the hand and neurology			0
" @entity18 explains on " the @entity11 " website that there are parts of the brain called the motor and sensory cortex areas that are critical for the hand 's coordinated action , as well as sensation that helps you to act -- for instance , when you reach into your pocket for coins , and you have to feel and grasp them in order to pick them up without seeing them			1
he supplied the scientific insights and the patients that inspired " the @entity11			2
" @entity18 and @entity1 also created short videos with the patients so that people can see what they are like in real life , in addition to @entity1 's portrayal			1
" we never pathologize the conditions but rather show you individual people living with their altered hands , so asking the audience to look beyond the problem to the person , " @entity18 said			1
the show has been performed in the @entity167 in 2010 and at the @entity168 in june 2011			0
@entity1 took it to @entity170 last year also at a @entity19 event			2
he is exploring multiple possibilities for 2012			0
@entity1 started out wanting to be an actor , and then got interested in dance , studying with the legendary dancer and choreographer @entity175			2
he also studied theater in @entity178			0
his interest in mime illusions started at 16 or 17 , but he credits that more to his imagination than to his hands			0
besides " the @entity11 , " he 's also created and performed " @entity183 , " which depicts the @entity185 moon landing with @entity1 's hands alone , and a hand - based dance performance called " @entity188			1
" he 's also a hand model			0
if you want to try your hands at this sort of performance , @entity1 has this advice : keep them moving , and keep them agile			1
" there 's a lot of bones there			0
you have more bones in hands and feet than you have in whole of the rest of your body			1
you need to keep them supple			0

' the @entity11 ' is a piece of performance theater about living with impaired hands
artist @entity1 and neuroscientist @entity18 collaborated on it
more than half the bones in the body are in the hands and feet
