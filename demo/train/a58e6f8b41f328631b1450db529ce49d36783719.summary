-- moments after the explosion , as he lay in a canal in rural @entity3 , cpl. @entity1 screamed twice at the top of his lungs			2
he was hurt so badly , his right leg blown away , his left one barely hanging on , but then he thought of two things			1
his wife and his men			2
he did n't think of dying			2
he wanted to concentrate on getting home , and before that , he did n't want his squad 's last image to be its leader wailing in pain			2
" i just [ told myself ] keep breathing , keep breathing			2
if you do that you 'll make it back to your wife , " he said recently by phone			2
" i knew i was injured			2
it was whether i could bring myself to remain calm and not freak out and cause my vitals to go crazy			2
" what @entity1 , who had stepped on the pressure plate of a roadside bomb , did n't realize at the time was that he had lost more than his legs			2
his arms also would need to be amputated			2
in another war , another time , @entity1 would have died on the battlefield			1
truth be told , there 's a strong chance his heart did stop at some point on that day in march 2011			2
but thanks to modern body armor and a helicopter that arrived in just six minutes -- as well as quick reactions by his fellow @entity44 -- @entity1 lived and became just the second quadruple amputee to survive battlefield injury wounds			1
they are a small group , the quadruple amputee combat vets -- just five of them			1
there are also 40 triple amputees			1
when they come home , they have their own set of issues , but many face the problems of every wounded vet			1
they start their new lives together			2
" when you are out on the battlefield , you do n't realize how many amputees there are because you are not there and you do n't see them , " @entity1 said			1
" but when you are in the hospital and see all the amputations			0
... but it 's like one big support group			1
it does n't matter whether you are a quad or missing one leg , it does n't matter , everybody is in it together and it 's like one big family in there			0
" for many wounded service members , the process of moving from military life back to civilian life can be confusing and fraught with delays			1
for @entity1 , it was the frustrating wait for his discharge paperwork			0
for many injured troops , it can be getting their benefits straightened out			1
" despite the @entity92 ' best efforts , oftentimes the transition feels like you 've been thrown off a cliff , " said @entity85 , who as an @entity87 captain lost a leg in @entity89 in 2003 and now works for the @entity90			0
organizations step up on september 11 , 2001 , an off - duty @entity98 firefighter named @entity99 found the @entity100 blocked to traffic during the chaos after the terrorist attacks on the @entity104			1
@entity99 , who was headed to play golf that morning , instead returned to his firehouse to grab his 60 pounds of gear , put it on and run the three miles to the burning towers , where he was killed			0
@entity111 's brother @entity110 created the @entity100 to @entity112			0
last year , he heard the story of @entity114 , a 22 - year - old soldier from his @entity116 neighborhood , who was the first quadruple amputee wounded in war			1
" we know that we 've been at war because of what happened on 9/11 , so we knew that we had to take care of our military , " @entity99 said			0
@entity99 went to visit @entity124 at @entity126 's @entity125 , where he promised the @entity87 specialist his organization would help with one of the soldier 's greatest needs , a home with smart technology			0
@entity99 's organization worked with other groups , including a foundation headed by actor @entity137 , to raise more than $ 800,000 for the home , which has special features like stoves and sinks that move up and down , elevators , heated outdoor wheelchair ramps ( to melt snow ) and appliances that @entity114 controls by computer			1
the @entity100 to @entity112 has agreed to build homes for the other quadruple amputees and -- it hopes -- for triple amputees			1
the foundation plans to build 11 houses this year			1
@entity151 : watch as @entity1 visits his future home " when you meet these kids they are so inspiring , " @entity99 said			0
their spirit , the way they work so hard to get back to living every day in what is their new normal			0
" @entity1 said his new home , being built in @entity163 , @entity164 , will lift a big burden			0
" having to rely on my wife to do a lot of things for me kinda takes a toll , " he said			0
" when you 're not able to do things for yourself it kind of sets you back a little bit , so getting in there and getting to run at everything with a full head of speed is going to be pretty nice			0
" other organizations , like the @entity178 , also help wounded service members face obstacles			1
the @entity178 helps veterans file disability claims			0
@entity183 , @entity178 assistant director for veterans ' health policy , said agents from the organization scour medical records to find everything a veteran should claim			1
they also explain to vets what conditions can not be claimed as related to their time in the military			1
the agents also explain what to look for in the future			0
" there are certain presumptive conditions for veterans of @entity89 and @entity3 that may pop up in one year or five , " @entity183 said			0
" but if no one tells them , they wo n't know			0
" more than 624,000 veterans from @entity89 and @entity3 have filed disability claims , @entity202 reported in january			0
more than two - thirds of all applications for benefits take the @entity208 more than 125 days to process			1
@entity85 , the former @entity87 captain who is an alumni manager for the @entity90 , is concerned that as wars end , @entity92 funds for the severely wounded will dry up and the @entity208 will struggle to fill the void			1
" our big concern is that the @entity208 is not prepared to fill those shoes either in research or long - term rehab care , " @entity85 said			1
" additional funding , additional staffing and ongoing oversight from @entity220 are important			0
" the next steps @entity1 , who now walks with prosthetic legs , plans to go back to college soon , after he and his wife , @entity224 , move into their new home			0
he thinks he 'll end up working for tunnels to @entity228 one day when it opens an office in @entity230			0
he wants to raise public awareness on the plight of this new kind of veteran , the triple or quadruple amputee , and help them get homes that work for them , he said			1
he also wants to counsel other wounded troops			1
recently he met with @entity87 staff sgt. @entity240 , who lost his four limbs in a similar way			1
@entity1 wanted to actually walk into a room at @entity125 and show @entity244 something important			0
" there 's life after the hospital bed , " he said			0
" you just have to put in the time and energy			0

more troops surviving bad wounds thanks to battlefield medicine , body armor
badly wounded vets find help via special organizations
one group raises money to build special homes for triple , quadruple amputees
