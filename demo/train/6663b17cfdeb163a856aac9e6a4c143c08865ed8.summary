-- ask teens the object of social media , and they 'll all tell you the same thing : to get " likes			1
" whether on @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 or @entity11 , young users understand the coin of this realm , and are more than happy to do what is necessary to accumulate it			2
but is the currency value neutral , or does it come with an agenda of its own ? living for likes makes a teen 's social career a whole lot easier , in some respects			1
now there 's a number letting kids know how popular they are , how well a photo is resonating with their friends , or whether their video stands a chance of vaulting them into the professional world of singing , skateboarding or twerking			2
what they may not understand , however , is that this game of likes is not taking place on a level playing field			1
it was constructed by companies whose multibillion - dollar stock valuations are depending on little more than generating traffic -- more likes , follows and favorites -- and then selling the data that can be gleaned from it			1
in a sense , major parts of our economy ( or at least the inflated valuations on the @entity56 exchange ) are now depending on the social media activity of kids			1
i 'm not sure that 's a pressure worth putting on them			2
on the surface , it all looks pretty empowering			0
for the @entity68 generation , changing the channel via remote control was about as interactive as mainstream media got -- and that only brought a kid from one corporate media conglomerate 's commercial programming to another 's			2
clearly , the social media universe , with its countless @entity8 pages , @entity76 channels , @entity9 feeds and @entity10 photos , offers a whole lot more choice			1
instead of watching a tv channel , today 's teens get to watch each other			2
that in itself amounts to power , freedom and agency , right ? maybe			0
for while all these clicks and keystrokes and photos and videos may be free , they come with a price			0
kids are n't paying with money , but with their attention and their hours of meticulous profile tweaking			0
they 're paying with their likes , their favorites , and their follows			2
and they get paid back with a new path to popularity or even fame			0
sometimes , the exchange is explicit			0
brands from soft drinks to automobiles ask kids to like an ad or promotion , all for the chance to be liked back or re-tweeted by the brand to its millions of followers			0
the teen gets more of those coveted likes			2
the companies get a real - time portrait of their potential customers and influencers , as well as all their friends			1
and this is n't just some virtual game			0
likes really do matter out here in the real world , too			1
new musicians and new writers alike must demonstrate that they have social media followings in order to find distribution and sponsors			1
a new kind of talent agency , the audience , has arisen to help young up - and - comers cultivate a social media presence , and then sell that network of followers to the appropriate advertisers			1
it 's actually a science			0
thanks to the immense data pools created by social media users , a firm like @entity141 can find the overlaps between fans of a certain pop star and those who have interacted with particular brands			1
that little venn diagram is marketer 's gold			0
and , to be fair , the @entity133 is helping young musicians build careers in a landscape where there are no record labels left willing to develop talent -- and no one buying music , anymore , anyway			0
by pairing talent with sponsors , the @entity133 creates a new revenue stream for artists , or at least the ones with the most viewed selfies			0
but it does create an oddly circular culture : kids develop social media audiences in order to become " stars , " which really just means having enough social media followers to sell out to a brand for sponsorship			1
perhaps more amazingly , none of them seem to mind			0
when i asked kids what they thought about " selling out " for my @entity182 documentary on social media , none of them could even tell me what " selling out " meant			1
they thought it had something to do with there not being any tickets left for a concert			0
the language barrier aside , young social media users today draw no distinction between art and commerce , culture and advertising			1
while kids engaged with social media have the ability to express themselves and their values to pretty much the rest of the developed world , they seem unaware of the extent to which these platforms shape the values they choose to express			1
as i learned from a 13 - year - old skateboarder who calls himself @entity211 , you get fewer likes for making videos of board tricks than you do for getting gorgeous girls to pose for you in the near nude , or just doing crazy antics in the street			2
he 's a massive success on @entity76 , where his videos often generate more than a million views			0
another teenager , a girl from near @entity223 , started making videos of herself singing , but is quickly learning that shots of her in her bedroom , or full body , or in a bathing suit , get her more attention			0
her videos no longer include her vocals			0
that 's the part i do n't think most teens grasp			2
nor do most adults have enough of a handle on this whole social media universe to fully articulate our misgivings			1
we know something is amiss , but saying it out loud feels so , well , out of touch			0
the reality here , however , is that it 's our young social media users who are out of touch -- or at least painfully oblivious to the way the tools and platforms they 're using in turn use them			1
they grew up with this stuff in their lives , and they accept these tools at face value , as features of the natural landscape			0
they were made by companies whose interests go far beyond helping kids express themselves and make friends			2
our kids are not the customers here ; they are both the product and the unwitting labor			0
our social media platforms are embedded with values that shape our perspectives and our behaviors			1
if we live in the social media landscape without an awareness of what it really wants from us , no one is really being empowered at all			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity282 .			1

@entity282 : teenagers aim to get as many likes as possible
likes have real value for teens but even more value for giant companies that profit , he says
@entity282 : getting liked on social media can be a route to getting your talents recognized
but he says behavior *designed* to gain more likes may not always be *beneficial*
