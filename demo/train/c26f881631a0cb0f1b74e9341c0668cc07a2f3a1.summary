@entity0 , @entity1 -- while @entity2 gets ready for the finale of " @entity4 " and tunes into hot new shows such as @entity8 's " @entity7 , " @entity9 is busy watching the continent 's annual vocal competition that many say gave rise to the entire phenomena of televised singing throw - downs : @entity16			1
since 1956 , @entity9 nations have sent representative artists and songs to battle for the boasting rights as top songsmiths			1
on tuesday evening the first semi-final of 2011 took place in a @entity0 , @entity1 , arena			1
and just like on @entity25 shows such as " idol , " losers went home and winners advanced			0
the only difference is that in this competition , entire countries are left saddened when songs fail to impress the voting public in @entity9 -- and members of a jury : the vote is split 50/50 between fans and a panel of experts			1
@entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 all advanced tuesday evening , while countries such as @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 were sent packing			2
the biggest shockers were arguably @entity48 's inclusion and @entity53 's exclusion from the finals			0
the winners advance to saturday 's final , where they will join the top contenders from thursday 's semi-final in an anticipated live broadcast of 25 artists from 25 countries singing their country 's representative tunes in a winner - takes - all evening that is among @entity9 's most watched events of the year			1
between 100 million and 120 million are expected to tune in this year for all three events			1
@entity1 -- last year 's winner -- the @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 all automatically qualify for saturday 's final as members of the " @entity16			1
" @entity25 largely ignore @entity16 , as they have little reason to pay attention : @entity25 broadcasters do not show the telecast and @entity2 has no official entry			2
but this year , some in the @entity25 are taking more interest than ever , thanks to a fresh crop of singers and increased exposure of the @entity16 brand brought about via @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98			1
to be sure , the @entity99 has a long way to go to gain fans in @entity2			0
for starters , they have no official media partner to show the semi-finals this week or the finals on saturday			0
fewer than 20 @entity25 journalists were accredited out of over 2000 total print , television , radio and @entity112 journalists at @entity16 in 2011			1
@entity79 , by comparison , has around 125 journalists , many representing major news outlets			0
still , interest in @entity16 is up in the @entity25 the number of @entity25 media outlets attending @entity16 this year has more than doubled from 2010 and @entity16 officials say website traffic from @entity2 overall is comparable to last year and even up slightly			1
many view the competition as a curiosity			0
this year 's crop at @entity16 has already produced two giggle - inducing entrants : @entity127 's official song in contention this year is simply titled " @entity131 " while @entity129 went with the not - exactly - subtly titled " @entity130			2
" but the level of songwriting across the board seems to be on the rise at @entity16			2
after all , this is where @entity137 first made their mark on the world stage and every year great songs rise above the din at the event , with several this year piquing interest -- many are raving about a song from @entity44			0
this year 's hopefuls might surprise curious @entity25 pop fans			0
@entity149 's " @entity150 , " from the @entity78 and @entity152 's " @entity151 " from @entity153 , rival anything on @entity25 top 40 radio at the moment , with slick production and memorable hooks			0
it remains to be seen just who will get the final nod saturday			0
odds makers have @entity79 and the @entity78 atop many lists at the moment , but that could change			0
whatever transpires at @entity16 this week , one thing is certain : it wo n't be dull .			2
