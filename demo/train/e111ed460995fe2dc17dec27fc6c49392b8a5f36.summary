-- two @entity2 - bound turkeys can thank good looks and personality for saving their lives			1
the 45 - pound birds endured months of rigorous training and rose to the head of a class of 20,000 feathered friends vying for a pardon from the dreaded @entity13 buffet			1
president @entity14 on wednesday continued a tradition of sparing turkeys from the chopping block , as each of his predecessors since @entity20 has done			1

then , last friday , the remaining birds competed in a high - stakes beauty contest			0
" we had the birds walk around to make sure they had a good strut on them and they were walking well			0
we were looking for nice white plumage on them , good feathering and a nice fanning tail , " @entity72 said			0
the finalists were selected and separated for a final round of handling and two standouts were dubbed the winners			0
the turkeys had two days to prepare before boarding a plane for the @entity108			2
( and yes , they did get their own version of a pat down )			1
" the birds made it great			0
no broken feathers or anything like that			0
that was a great trip for them , " @entity72 said			0
