-- it is a familiar tactical strategy at the @entity2 : when an oral argument gets too dense over regulatory interpretation -- turn it into a sports analogy			1
an @entity7 administration lawyer did that tuesday in closely watched environmental appeal , comparing federal efforts aimed at curbing air pollution to basketball scores			2
the court seemed impressed , with chief justice @entity13 calling it a " pretty good " analogy			0
after that the athletic aphorisms just would not stop			0
at issue is whether an " upwind " state that is polluting a " downwind " state is free of any obligations under the so - called @entity23 provision , unless and until federal regulators have quantified the upwind state 's contribution to downwind state 's air pollution problems			1
the case is an important test of federal regulatory power , and the rules issued two years ago by the @entity33 are being challenged by a coalition of 15 states , as well as several energy companies and labor unions			1
leaders in some mostly conservative states say lost jobs and higher energy costs are at stake from what they see as arbitrary and ambiguous regulations			1
but the administration and its environmental allies counter @entity48 ' health should come first , and that as many as 45,000 deaths could be prevented each year if the @entity50 would be allowed to go into effect			0
overall , it appeared the @entity33 may prevail in the complex regulatory case , based on the comments from the justices during 90 minutes of arguments			1
it would be a rare environmental victory in a conservative majority court , if that were to occur			2
the arguments come just hours after eight of nine governors from the affected downwind states signed a petition urging the @entity33 to force nine southern and midwestern upwind states to reduce smog and soot emissions from power plants			1
the one downwind governor who did not sign was gov. @entity70 , the @entity72 @entity71			0
those @entity74 or @entity75 governors criticized a federal appeals court ruling last year against federal oversight , saying it " allows upwind states to postpone the costs of air pollution controls for years , while in the interim downwind states and their residents are forced to suffer the present consequences of that pollution			1
" enforcement of what is known as the @entity88 was adopted by the @entity33 in 2011 , but remains on hold while the court cases work toward a final conclusion			1
in tuesday 's session , @entity93 lawyer @entity92 got the ball rolling when he said the @entity33 should be allowed to use the somewhat discretionary standard " contribute significantly , " when determining a state 's cost - based share of transported air pollution			1
" there are various reasons to think that @entity33 reasonably construed that term to include a component of difficulty of achievement , " he said of a downwind state 's inability to comply , in the face of continuing pollution from its neighbors			1
" we might say that dunking a basketball is a more significant achievement for somebody who is 5 feet 10 than for somebody who is 6 feet 10			0
" @entity13 took up the challenge when sharply questioning the lawyer representing corporate and union interests , @entity119			0
" if you ask the coach what significantly contributed to the loss , he 's going to talk about the missed layup rather than the missed desperation throw , " said the chief justice , " even though as far as amount , each was going to count for two points			2
" justice @entity130 used the metaphor to turn the point on its head			2
" the question you should ask the coach , when you lost 101 to 100 : which of the 101 points contributed most to your loss ? " he asked , bringing laughter in the courtroom			0
" i mean , he would not answer the one that was the layup			0
he 'd say what do you mean ? all of the 101 points			0
" @entity130 added the proposed @entity33 rule changes were not what @entity145 had in mind when it passed the landmark @entity149			1
adding to the sports talk , he said the agency has " hidden the ball " with its ambiguous standards			2
" we 're not going to tell you what the target is , " he said , relying on his own interpretation of what federal regulators are doing to some states			1
" it 's up to you to come up with a @entity165 ( state implementation plan ) and we 'll tell you after the fact whether that @entity165 happened to meet the target that we 've invented			2
" among the provisions being challenged is the @entity33 's cost - based formula , using what it calls a balance between an upwind state 's obligation to reduce coal - fired pollution , and the amount of money that would be required for a downwind state to feasibly meet its own obligations			1
that calculation was a key part of the oral argument , which critics of the policies say unfairly punishes some states more than others , by placing a greater financial burden for their share of unhealthy air particulates			1
@entity190 solicitor general @entity189 , representing one of the states challenging the rules told the court , " @entity33 's actions in this case have written the states out of the @entity149			1
... @entity33 has left the states completely in the dark about the meaning of the phrase ' contribute significantly			1
' " justice @entity202 called it a tough problem and questioned the upwind states ' position			2
" but it 's supposed to advance the ball " using yet another sports reference			2
" so there is a procedure for the states to come in if they can come up with a better plan			0
that 's what you 've just heard , and so do it			0
so what 's arbitrary or capricious about such a system ? " @entity189 said it was up to the @entity33 to issue clear guidelines before enforcing those standards , and the burden was on the federal government , not the states			1
@entity202 , in response : " there 's six states that contribute to the seventh state 's pollution , and how much each state can cut back depends			2
it depends on what it costs			0
it depends on how much they contribute			0
it depends upon what the other states will do			0
it depends upon where the wind blows , and that changes all the time , " he said			0
the justices next february will hear a related case : can the @entity33 tighten emission standards for " stationary " greenhouse gas sources -- such as power plants -- in what the government says is an effort to stem the effects of global warming			1
the high court in 2007 affirmed the conclusions by much of the scientific community that greenhouse gases are an air pollutant , but that case just dealt with emissions from motor vehicles			0
the high court will decide if the agency properly extended its regulatory authority			0
the consolidated cases argued tuesday are @entity33 v. @entity265 ( 12 - 1182 ) and @entity266			2
v. eme @entity265 ( 12 - 1183 )			0
a ruling is due in the next several months .			0

states that pollute are under fire from those that do *n't*
fifteen states , other *groups* challenging new federal *anti-pollution* rules
there 's a chance the @entity33 may prevail in the case before conservative @entity2
oral arguments over 90 minutes take on sports metaphor theme
