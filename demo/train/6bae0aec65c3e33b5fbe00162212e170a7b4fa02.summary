@entity1 's interest in drones began with a bit of playful drone - on - drone violence			1
he began attending " @entity14 " - like meetups in the @entity7 where enthusiasts pit the amateur flying machines against each other in bloodless battles of strength and flying technique			1
" we were beginners , so just getting off the ground caused damage , " @entity15 said of the dogfights , which were won by whichever drone lasted the longest and got back up in the air fastest			1
and so the idea for an " indestructible " drone design was born			1
@entity15 , along with @entity24 , started game of @entity26			0
using an extremely durable plastic called @entity29 , the company creates inexpensive but rugged drones capable of surviving everything from high - impact crashes to shotgun blasts			1
for many , the word " drone " still conjures images of military strikes or a near - future retail fleet delivering packages or pizzas			2
but while commercial uses of unmanned aerial vehicles are banned while tangled up in federal regulations , a growing number of drone enthusiasts are embracing the still - young technology as a creative new pursuit			1
the result is a lively community of hobbyists , entrepreneurs and aerial photographers , some of whom gathered this week for a picnic and flying demonstration in a suburban field south of @entity58			1
the " drone fly - in " event was the brainchild of @entity62 , which is celebrating a new all - drone issue			2
" the technology is still very much in the hands of the do - it - yourselfers and the enthusiasts , " said @entity64 , @entity62 's executive editor			2
rise of the @entity70 drones the maker movement , with its legions of tinkerers , is an ideal community to embrace drones			1
the @entity70 drone technology has grown organically from existing popular maker interests , including micro-controllers , robotics and radio - controlled vehicles			2
drones combine all those disciplines to create advanced and programmable versions of what look like toy helicopters			2
the most practical and popular use for the devices is aerial photography			1
lightweight cameras like @entity89 can be affixed to drones such as the @entity92 quadcopter or the forthcoming $ 750 @entity93 from @entity94			2
specialized drone rigs can even hold larger professional cameras			2
soaring up to several hundred feet above the ground produces some unbeatable angles			0
but to get a perfect shot , hobbyists program their drones with precise routes and mount the cameras on gimbals , which keep the camera steady and pointed in one direction even as the drone moves about			1
" for us , drones means ' capable of autonomy , ' " said @entity109 , founder of @entity94 and the former editor of @entity111			2
being able to program an exact path for a drone instead of manually steering it is what makes the technology so promising for commercial and photography use , enthusiasts say			1
experimenting and making playing pilot is part of the fun for hobbyists			0
just as there are a variety of uses for drones , there 's a number of ways to steer them			2
the more traditional controls are hand - held joysticks and knobs			0
more advanced controlling can be done through computers and increasingly , tablets and smartphones , although some purists claim the touchscreens lack the tactile satisfaction of physical controls			0
a startup called @entity143 is working on a $ 129 accessory ( it bears a slight resemblance to walrus tusks ) that clips onto the end of an @entity149 and can be used to control standard , mid-range drones over a radio connection			2
with the app , you can program a route and monitor the device 's flight progress , though full manual controls are coming in a future update			0
the most immersive , and arguably most fun , way to pilot a drone is through first - person view ( @entity162 )			0
a small camera is affixed to the front of the drone , and a person on the ground views a live stream from the drone 's point of view though a pair of goggles			0
users can control the drone 's direction in real time , which feels similar to piloting an aircraft from inside a cockpit			0
some enthusiasts even use @entity162 setups for drone races			1
many drones are square quadcopters and it can be difficult to tell which way they 're facing at any given time			0
the @entity162 live stream clears up any confusion , though sometimes it 's tricky to find a downed drone when you did n't see where it landed			0
flying under the radar the @entity195 is expected to complete standards and rules for commercial drones by late 2015 , though senators and lobbyists are pushing for an earlier deadline			1
until the @entity195 clears drones for flight in general airspace , the devices are only allowed to be flown for recreation and below 400 feet			1
manufacturers of professional drones are stuck on the sidelines for the time being , but this has left the door open for hobbyists to experiment and invent			0
the consumer - first approach might help pave the way for more widespread acceptance of commercial drones whenever they take to the air			1
some enterprising drone companies are already doing business while avoiding the glare of the @entity195			1
aerial drone photographers are selling their services to real estate companies and the movie and tv industry			1
journalists have used the devices to capture footage of news events			0
a handful of people have been sent cease and desist letters from the @entity195			1
because they can be outfitted with cameras , microphones and other surveillance equipment , drones will no doubt be used by law enforcement			0
but such drones will have to battle public privacy concerns in the @entity243 " people decide what they 're comfortable with , " said @entity109 , who pointed out that it will continue to be illegal to fly drones over built - up areas like housing or cities			0
play on drones , called @entity252 by large companies and industry groups , are expected to be a $ 89 billion business worldwide in the next decade , according to the @entity256			0
for example , agriculture will be a huge market for the devices , which could allow famers to monitor crops autonomously			0
for now , inventors and hobbyists are enjoying improving the technology while waiting for the commercial industry to catch up			0
photographers are skirting around regulations , companies are selling new commercial models in the @entity243 and in countries with more relaxed regulations , and the game of @entity26 guys are busy with their high - tech endurance tests			1
" i took [ the drone ] out into the wasteland with a baseball bat and my anger , " said @entity15			0
" i 've wanted to destroy them but i 've been unable to do so , so i decided to sell them			0

while commercial drones wait on @entity195 approval , a lively hobbyist community takes to the air
amateur drone enthusiasts have meetups , races and drone dogfights
some photographers are charging for aerial photography while skirting @entity195 rules
