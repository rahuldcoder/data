imagine shocks radiating across your cheek , a knife cutting into your skin or the feeling of hot coal burning your face , but not being able to find relief from the pain for months , or even years			1
that 's what some trigeminal neuralgia patients say they endure on a regular basis			1
@entity14 is a facial pain disorder associated with the trigeminal nerve , which carries sensation from your brain to your face			1
slight touches to the face , whether it 's a breeze , hair falling onto your temple or simply brushing your teeth , may trigger flashes of pain			1
the pain is most commonly caused by a blood vessel pushing on the trigeminal nerve			1
it affects approximately 12 out of every 100,000 people per year , according to the @entity36 , and is more common in women and people over 50			1
" @entity14 is an uncommon disease and as a result , most physicians have very little experience with it			1
that is one of the reasons it 's difficult to diagnose , " said @entity44 , a @entity45 neurosurgeon who specializes in the disorder			1
the unbearable pain and search for a cure , as well as the medical field 's unfamiliarity with the disorder , has led a group of about 30 trigeminal neuralgia patients to fight for awareness			1
several of them , in addition to others with the disorder , started by sharing their personal stories with @entity65			1
' i want to imagine a world where nobody has ... this pain ' @entity70 is one of those people			1
her goal is to educate others about the disease , as well as let people know about the first @entity76 on october 7			1
dozens of buildings and structures across the world are lighting up teal for the day			0
" if we know that somebody , somewhere is looking for a cure and not just another medication or an even more invasive , risky procedure , it gives us hope , " she wrote in her @entity65			1
" i want to imagine a world where nobody has to survive with this pain			1
" @entity91 started experiencing the facial pain in 2005 and was diagnosed with @entity93			1
a variety of medications were ineffective and in 2008 , the registered nurse from @entity97 , @entity98 , admitted defeat and resigned from her job			0
" i had achieved my dream and there it was , being taken away from me by this relentless , debilitating pain , " she said			2
it was seven years from her first pangs of pain before she was diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia			2
as a way to cope , the 41 - year - old has turned to online support groups			2
" my online friends have been my lifeline , " she said			0
" trigeminal neuralgia has taken away many things , but it has given me the chance to ' meet ' some amazing people and to make lifelong friendships			2
" ' i have forgotten what a pain - free day feels like ' one of the people @entity91 met online was @entity123 , a former high school history teacher from rural @entity124			1
@entity91 's bravery inspired him to write about his experience , @entity123 said			0
leaving his classroom on september 7 , 2011 , the sunlight seared his eyes , bringing on what he thought was his first migraine			2
the searing pain never left			2
after getting lidocaine injections to treat the migraine a month later , he said he started experiencing strange facial pains			2
" there were shocks and pangs in my right cheek , " he wrote on @entity65			1
" it felt as if a hot coal was lying on my right eye socket			0
" since then , wind , noise and even a random touch have all intensified his never - ending pain			2
@entity123 was later diagnosed with two disorders : " atypical " trigeminal neuralgia and a persistent unilateral headache on the same side			0
the " atypical " form of the disorder is marked by constant aching , burning and pain , according to the @entity155			1
numerous migraine and anti-seizure drugs have n't worked for him , and he 's not a prime candidate for surgery to relieve pressure on his nerve			0
there are n't any blood vessels pushing on the trigeminal nerve , so the cause of his case is unknown			0
" i have now forgotten what a pain free day feels like , and that changes you , " said the stay - at - home dad			2
" you lose parts of yourself			0
you lose friends and family that ca n't deal with the fact that they can not give you a hug , say a prayer and make you better			0
" watch video from another trigeminal neuralgia patient ' watching him suffer has broken me ' @entity186 has crossed the country trying to find relief for her 16 - year - old son , @entity189			2
he was diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia when he was 11 , she said			0
" watching him suffer has broken me , " the mother said			0
" @entity189 used to be an all - star baseball player , gifted student with high academic scores and awards , with tons of friends , and now he barely leaves our home			0
" @entity189 has had four surgeries to alleviate his pain , and four more surgeries after a complication occurred during one of the procedures			2
" trigeminal neuralgia has taken over our lives and is relentless , " she said			0
" it has robbed my child of his life			0
" the @entity215 , @entity216 , mom wishes people knew about the real pain that patients with this invisible illness experience			1
" if @entity189 walked around with a hatchet sticking out of his face , then people would get it , but trigeminal neuralgia is invisible , and i hate it			2
" ' i am a trigeminal neuralgia warrior ' when a flash of pain shot from her eye to her jaw one day in 1998 , @entity229 hurried to the mirror looking for a mark on her face			0
the @entity241 , @entity242 , resident tried to describe the pain to her doctor , but she felt like a lunatic			0
she spent five years struggling to find answers before she was diagnosed			0
even after multiple medications and surgeries to treat the disorder , none have helped ease her facial pain			1
" a typical day in my life knows no real time and follows no structure			0
pain wins over all else and many days are spent in bed , " she said			0
" i have missed many family functions , important birthdays and reunions with friends because the pain won on those days			0
" to stay positive , @entity229 calls herself a " trigeminal neuralgia warrior			0
" surviving the " horrendous pain , the harsh medications and lack of awareness " has inspired her to fight for help and understanding of this outwardly invisible disorder			1
" if my story has been read and shared then i know i did my part to start people learning , talking about and becoming more aware that such an evil condition exists and needs attention so desperately , " she said			1
" it 's hopefully just the beginning , there is still so much that needs to be done			0
