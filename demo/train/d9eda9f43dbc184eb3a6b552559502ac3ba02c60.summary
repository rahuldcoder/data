-- the @entity2 men 's basketball team can not compete for next year 's national championship after the @entity4 denied the school 's appeal of a postseason ban based on its athletes ' academic performance			1
the @entity10 earlier had been ordered to sit out the 2013 @entity4 tournament , because of its past players ' sub-par academic performance rate			1
led by longtime coach @entity15 , the program had won that tourney last spring and , thus , captured the national title			1
the @entity2 appealed that ruling , but to no avail , both the school and the @entity4 said thursday			2
" it is disturbing that our current players must pay a penalty for the academic performance of students no longer enrolled , " @entity2 president @entity21 said in a statement			0
" no educator or parent purposefully punishes young people for the failings of others			0
" the @entity4 defended the decision , with spokesman @entity35 stating " schools have known since 2006 " about the " serious penalties , including postseason restriction " for programs that did not meet set academic requirements			1
" also , in @entity2 's first waiver denial , @entity4 staff noted the men 's basketball team 's overall lack of academic achievement and minimal academic progress over several years , " @entity35 said by e-mail to @entity0			1
the move is a result of the @entity4 's decision to implement a recommendation , backed by @entity54 education secretary @entity53 and the @entity55 , to penalize programs that did not or were not on track to graduate at least half of their student athletes			1
" if you ca n't manage to graduate half of your players , how serious is the institution and the coach and the program about their players ' academic success ? " @entity53 , who played basketball while attending @entity70 , told reporters last spring			1
" are you actually preparing your student athletes for success -- is it just on the court or in life ? " the @entity4 notes that a 930 @entity79 , or academic performance rate , equates to a program being at the fulcrum to meet that criteria -- with higher scores indicating that a program is on track to graduate more than half its players , and lower ones indicating it is not			2
the apr score for the @entity2 men 's basketball 's team , based on data from the 2009 - 2010 academic year , was an 893 , according to the @entity4 's website			1
that led to the @entity4 immediately determining that the @entity10 must offer two fewer scholarships , as well as setting the stage for next year 's postseason ban			1
any university team in an @entity4 - sanctioned sport had to " achieve a 900 multiyear apr or a 930 average over the most recent two years to be eligible " for postseason play during the 2012 - 2013 school year , according to @entity35			0
because the @entity4 is " still in the waiver process , " there is no " exact figure " yet as to how many other programs will be penalized like @entity108 's men 's basketball team , added @entity35			0
the academic standards will get even more stringent next school year , the spokesman noted			0
by then , a 930 apr score average will be required over four years , or at least a 940 for the two most recent years , for an interscholastic athletics program to compete in a 2014 - 2015 postseason tournament			0
the @entity2 said , in its release issued thursday , that its men 's basketball team is well ahead of that requirement			0
that includes a " nearly perfect 978 " apr score for the squad that won the national title and a " perfect apr score " for the fall 2011 semester			0
" while we as a university and coaching staff clearly should have done a better job academically with our men 's basketball student athletes in the past , the changes we have implemented have already had a significant impact and have helped us achieve the success we expect in the classroom , " @entity15 said			0
this is n't the first blow by the @entity4 to the @entity10 program , which traditionally has been among the best in its @entity137 and the nation as a whole			2
in february 2011 , the @entity4 suspended @entity15 for three conference games , reduced the number of scholarships and mandated recruiting restrictions after determining that team staff members violated rules by exchanging 150 calls and 190 text messages with prospective recruits and providing complimentary game tickets			2
the @entity4 's infractions committee also found that @entity15 knowingly allowed a booster and certified @entity153 agent to participate in recruitment and make prohibited financial contributions to a potential student athlete			2
the coach responded that he was " very disappointed with the @entity4 's decision in this case			0
" a 2005 inductee into the basketball hall of fame , @entity15 has won three @entity4 national championships in his career -- including his last 26 seasons with the @entity10 -- and ranks sixth all - time with 873 victories , according to the official @entity2 athletics website			1
@entity0 's @entity167 contributed to this report .			0
