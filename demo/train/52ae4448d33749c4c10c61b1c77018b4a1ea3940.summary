-- as a long - time aviation journalist and regular traveler , i 've been following the debate on whether the use of cell phones and other wireless devices should be allowed on airplanes			1
and now that the @entity9 has said it will weigh in on the matter , let me add my voice to the growing chorus of those who are firmly opposed to the idea			1
letting passengers talk nonstop during flights would be like being stuck in hell			1
i 'm a working mother who is a student pilot and active in several professional and church activities			0
the airplane is one of the few places on ( or over the ) earth where i can sit quietly and not worry about answering or making phone calls			1
yes , i have used airline @entity24 to sneak in some work or surf the @entity26 , but mostly i put on my noise - canceling headphones and relax as much as one can on a commercial coach flight			1
but all that peace would be ruined if cell phones were allowed to be used on planes			1
could you imagine the cacophony of chatter you would hear on a @entity36 - to - @entity37 flight ? i can , because i 've heard it already			1
i used to take the @entity40 train between @entity36 and @entity41 pretty regularly			0
on those rare occasions when i could n't get a seat in the @entity45 , it was sheer hell , even with headphones			1
i heard privileged conversations that would get lawyers fired			0
i listened to talk that was n't fit for children under 17			2
i was forced to eavesdrop on people discussing personal , private matters -- all done in normal tones			0
and people did n't hesitate in trying to have their loud conversations even in the @entity45			0
so sit back , close your eyes , and imagine hearing all those conversations trapped in a high - speed metal tube flying between @entity62 and @entity63 , or @entity41 to @entity64			0
how many hours is that ? do you really want to hear the chatter of people sitting right next to you or 15 feet away ? even if the talks are muffled through your noise - canceling headphones , that does n't make it any better			2
what if you just want to sleep through the flight ? or take a respite from the always - on connected life you have on the ground ? travelers already get a sense of what this sounds like when a plane lands			2
you hear the chirps and beeps of phones turning on and snippets of conversation starting before the aircraft wheels have even touched the ground			0
" yes , @entity89 , we just landed			0
" " i 'll meet you at @entity91 12			0
no claim 12 ! i 'm here ! @entity93 's the party ? " if i still have n't convinced you , then consider the flight crews who will be forced to referee any cell phone disputes			1
despite what travelers may think , flight attendants are not there to help you with your bags or serve you drinks			2
they are actually there to ensure your safety on your flight			2
safety could be compromised if flight attendants are too busy refereeing -- or not -- people who are fighting about loud conversations all around them			2
passengers are already on edge these days as civility in travel seems to have diminished greatly			0
allowing the use of cell phones on flights will push us all closer to the cliff of our sanity			1
so here 's hoping the airlines and related aviation groups fire up their public relations machines to squash this idea and instead , urge the @entity9 to continue the inflight cell phone ban			1
and travelers -- enjoy the down time			0
watch an in - flight movie			0
the calls will be waiting for you when you land			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity137 .			1

@entity9 is considering rules to allow the use of cell phone during flights
@entity144 : letting passengers talk nonstop would be like being stuck in hell
she says the airplane is one of the few places where one can have some quiet
