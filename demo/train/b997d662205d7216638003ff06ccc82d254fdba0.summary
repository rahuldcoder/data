@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 aircraft targeted warships overnight , striking eight of @entity1 leader @entity9 's vessels in @entity0 's seaport , the organization said friday morning			1
a @entity1 government official said the targets included commercial vessels as well as military ones			1
" all @entity5 's targets are military in nature and are directly linked to the @entity9 regime 's systematic attacks on the @entity1 people , " said rear adm. @entity15 , deputy commander of @entity16			1
" given the escalating use of naval assets , @entity5 had no choice but to take decisive action to protect the civilian population of @entity1 and @entity5 forces at sea			1
" in a statement , @entity5 said the attack occurred after two weeks of escalating use of government maritime forces that had disrupted the flow of humanitarian assistance			1
all the vessels targeted were naval warships with no civilian utility , said @entity15			0
but a @entity1 official who led @entity2 personnel on a tour of the area said the commercial port , not the nearby military port , was hit			1
from the distance at which @entity2 was allowed to view the area , it was not clear what sort of vessels were hit			0
the port 's general manager , @entity49 , told reporters that six rockets struck in three strikes that hit five coast guard boats and one navy vessel , which had been in dock for maintenance			2
the port remained operational , he said			0
@entity1 government spokesman @entity59 called the attack a " clear attempt to bring the nation to its knees , " and said the port serves as the main entry point for food and other critical supplies into the country			1
" the nation will starve , " he said			0
still , though the port was in disarray , the damage did not appear major , he said			0
@entity59 's claims came as president @entity74 , addressing a global audience , condemned the use of force against @entity79 protesters by longtime allies and adversaries alike			1
" @entity74 is still delusional , " @entity59 said			2
" he believes the lies that his own government is spreading around the world and his own media is spreading around the world			2
they have not proved one single charge against us and they refuse to investigate us			0
" he added , " it 's not @entity74 who decides whether @entity9 leaves @entity1 or not			1
it 's the @entity1 people who decide their future			2
" the report of the attack came shortly after at least three explosions could be heard in the city			0
a government official said five airstrikes had targeted the port and the police academy was also hit on thursday , during which @entity5 jets could be seen been flying overhead throughout the day			2
@entity1 state - run television reported the strikes with a " breaking news " font that said , " military source : residential and military locations in @entity0 are currently being shelled by @entity5 forces			1
" earlier thursday , crowds of @entity1 took to the streets of @entity0 , honking horns and dancing in the streets in support of the country 's leader , @entity9			1
more than 100 people outside the headquarters of state television chanted " @entity125 , @entity9 and @entity1 only " and other @entity124 and anti-rebel slogans			1
the demonstrations were sparked , apparently , in response to state - run television reports that parts of the rebel capital @entity133 were " rejecting the colonialists and their followers , " as the government describes @entity5 and the rebels			2
a group of journalists , including a @entity2 team , was taken by government minders to see the celebrations in @entity0			0
among the crowds composed predominantly of young men were a number of families -- including fathers carrying children on their shoulders			0
one woman , who brought her 10 - year - old - daughter , carried a portrait of the @entity1 leader and said they were celebrating their country being united again			0
many then drove toward @entity0 's @entity154 singing and honking their horns , waving @entity1 's green flag and portraits of @entity9			1
but @entity2 journalists in @entity133 saw no indications of counter-revolutionary uprisings or protests there			0
and the @entity164 denied government claims that @entity167 forces had seized control of the city			0
and residents of @entity133 said they had not seen or heard of @entity167 rallies there			0
two months ago , @entity9 loyalists in @entity0 erupted in similar cheers when state media incorrectly reported that @entity175 and @entity133 had fallen to government troops			2
@entity9 has been fighting to keep control of his country in the face of an uprising that has led to a number of key cities falling into rebel control			0
the chief prosecutor of the @entity185 this week requested a warrant for @entity9 's arrest on charges of crimes against humanity			1
@entity2 's @entity191 and @entity192 contributed to this report .			0
