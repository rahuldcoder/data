-- this is all we know for sure : @entity3 , 27 , and @entity4 , 26 , were backpacking in @entity5 while on break from their jobs teaching @entity9 in @entity10			1
on july 30 , the friends were admitted to @entity12 in @entity13			1
both were vomiting , had difficulty breathing and showed signs of severe dehydration			1
@entity18 was eventually released from the hospital			2
she returned later that night to hear the devastating news -- three hours after being admitted , @entity3 had gone into respiratory failure and died			1
two days later , @entity18 was dead			2
what we do n't know for sure is what triggered their deaths			2
the travelers ' stories are just the latest in a string of mysterious tourist deaths in @entity31			1
investigators with the @entity33 suspect poisoning is to blame , but determining the origin has proven difficult			1
meanwhile , friends and family are desperate for answers			2
" it 's been a nightmare trying to get information , " @entity3 's sister @entity39 said			1
whatever happened to her we need to make sure does n't happen to somebody else			2
" not yet determined almost immediately , international media reports began linking the deaths to an incident in @entity52 in june in which two @entity54 sisters died			1
a hotel maid found @entity56 and @entity57 , 25 and 20 , in their room on @entity60 more than 12 hours after their deaths			2
the sisters were covered in vomit , according to @entity65			2
in february 2011 , @entity67 resident @entity66 , 23 , died in @entity68 , @entity52 , after arriving at a local hospital with low blood pressure , difficulty breathing and dehydration from vomiting , according to the @entity67 television network @entity73			1
in the @entity75 where @entity76 had stayed , the @entity74 says three other visitors -- a @entity52 tour guide and an elderly @entity80 couple -- died between january and may 2011			1
other media reports linked @entity3 's and @entity18 's deaths to the 2009 deaths of @entity84 and @entity85 , who had similar symptoms in adjacent rooms at the @entity89 on the island of @entity60			1
( the hotel has since changed its name )			2
speculation on the cause arose with each death -- ranging from alcohol poisoning to something the victims ate			1
as @entity3 's relatives read story after story , they realized they were n't the only family frustrated and confused			1
the cause of death in every case was eerily similar to the one written on @entity3 's death report : " not yet determined			1
" global citizens @entity109 says it was " heartbreaking " to unzip her sister 's backpack			2
@entity113 was a big map of @entity5 , a book about the history of the region and a list of historical sites she wanted to visit			1
her belongings had been returned home to @entity124 , @entity125 , where the girls grew up			2
fundraisers helped offset the more than $ 10,000 it cost the family to repatriate her cremated body			2
@entity109 is still in shock			0
@entity3 -- beautiful , adventurous , full - of - life @entity3 -- is dead			1
born just a year and 10 days apart , the sisters talked every day , even when @entity3 was halfway around the world			1
" she was the funniest person i know , " @entity109 said			0
" she always made me laugh			0
she never wasted a day ... every weekend she was doing something exciting			0
" both @entity3 and @entity18 were experienced travelers			1
@entity3 had applied for the teaching abroad program after graduating from @entity138 in @entity139			1
she had already taught for two years in @entity10 when the school asked her to come back for a second stint			0
" those kids adored her , " @entity39 said			0
@entity18 , originally from @entity144 , @entity145 , had vacationed in @entity146 , @entity147 and the @entity148 , her high school friend @entity143 told @entity0			0
both women had been to @entity5 before and @entity18 spoke the language			1
among the belongings returned to @entity18 's family was detailed information about the @entity154 and emergency contact numbers			0
" i encouraged her to follow her dreams , go where her heart wants to go , " @entity143 said			0
" i wanted to live vicariously through her adventures			0
" when @entity3 's friend @entity163 posted about her death on @entity165 , e-mails started flooding in			1
a frequent traveler himself , @entity163 had a large network of international acquaintances whom had never heard about this series of mysterious deaths and expressed concern			0
he launched a @entity165 page last week called @entity175			0
he said he hopes the site will become a community of global citizens who are eager to educate others on the challenges facing travelers abroad			0
five ways to stay healthy while traveling abroad at the top of the @entity165 page is a collection of photos of those who have died in circumstances similar to @entity188 and @entity3			1
" all these girls , you see their faces , " @entity163 said			0
" ( they 're ) all young , 20 - somethings that just wanted to have a life - changing experience			0
" seeking answers in 2011 , @entity73 traveled to @entity68 , @entity52 , to search for evidence in the @entity66 case			0
show producers spoke with dr. @entity198 , a @entity200 toxic chemical consultant , who had reviewed @entity76 's pathology reports and believed she died of pesticide ingestion			1
the swabs collected by @entity73 in the @entity75 showed moderate levels of chlorpyrifos , @entity198 told @entity0 in an email last week			0
according to the @entity209 , chlorpyrifos can cause nausea , dizziness , confusion and , in high levels , respiratory paralysis and death			0
the chemical is banned for use in homes and hotels in most countries , @entity198 said			0
yet it 's still legal in @entity52 and @entity5 , he said , and was included in the pesticide sprayed in the @entity75			1
" the level of ( chlorpyrifos ) in this product is quite low and should not normally cause a problem			2
however , in my work we have found many sprayer companies ' top up ' the level of ( chlorpyrifos ) when they are battling bedbugs in @entity31			1
" evidence for the insecticide theory is mounting			0
@entity52 police recently announced they found traces of the insect repellent deet in the @entity57 sisters ' bodies , according @entity65			0
investigators believe the deet was added as an ingredient to a popular cocktail served on the island			0
the @entity75 was torn down this summer after the @entity247 concluded three of the deaths were " probably connected to the use of pesticides , " according to the @entity74			0
the problem is that chemical poisoning is very hard to verify , @entity198 says			2
@entity254 ' half - life -- or the amount of time that passes before half of the original amount disappears -- in humans is about one day			0
@entity5 authorities have released very little information about the cause of death for @entity3 and @entity18			1
investigators might know more when autopsy results come back in a couple of weeks			0
but for the survivors , just knowing the answer is n't good enough anymore			0
they are determined to raise awareness and are searching for the next step , whether that 's better education , tougher insecticide regulation or banning these chemicals outright			0
" @entity4 could have been alive today , " said @entity143			1
" i feel like if we can at least let the world know that this is happening ... maybe when a parent 's daughter ( or ) son tells them that they are backpacking in @entity283 , it will not be the last goodbye			0

@entity3 , 27 , and @entity4 , 26 , died in @entity5 on july 30
their symptoms matched others ' who have died in @entity31 : vomiting , low blood pressure , dehydration
experts suspect pesticide poisoning from a spray used to combat bed bugs in the region
