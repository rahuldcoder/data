-- a @entity3 woman convicted on misdemeanor charges in the death of her son after he darted out into traffic will receive a new trial , a judge ruled			1
@entity10 's trial is set to begin october 25 , according to an order filed by @entity13 state court judge @entity12 on tuesday			1
@entity16 's case had attracted national attention from parents , the @entity15 and transportation advocates , who said @entity16 , from the @entity18 suburb of @entity19 , was being unfairly prosecuted because she chose to cross the road at the bus stop across from her apartment instead of traveling to the nearest crosswalk , three - tenths of a mile away			1
in april 2010 , @entity16 and her three children had just gotten off the bus across from their apartment building when her 4 - year - old son , @entity30 , broke away from her and ran into the street			1
a car struck the boy , causing fatal injuries			2
@entity16 and one of her two daughters also suffered minor injuries			2
five weeks after the accident , investigators came to @entity16 's home , said her aunt , @entity42			1
@entity16 was charged with three misdemeanors : second - degree vehicular homicide , failing to cross at a crosswalk and reckless conduct , according to court records			2
a jury convicted her this month			0
although prosecutors did not recommend jail time , each count carried a potential sentence of one year in jail -- for a total of 36 months			1
she potentially faced more jail time than the man driving the car , @entity61			1
@entity61 fled the scene after the accident but later admitted being involved , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity64			0
he was sentenced to five years in prison but served only six months			0
he is serving the remainder of the sentence on probation			0
@entity16 on tuesday was sentenced to 12 months of probation and 40 hours of community service , but @entity12 also gave her the option to seek a new trial			1
during the hearing tuesday , @entity16 's attorney , @entity74 , asked for mercy , saying his client had suffered enough			1
" do n't think for one moment that this mother of three does n't blame herself for what happened , " he said			0
but , he said , the white stripes of a crosswalk are not " impenetrable walls of steel " that could have prevented a driver from striking someone crossing the street			0
such accidents happen every day , he said			0
assistant solicitor general @entity89 said her office would accept whatever sentence the court suggested			0
" these cases are inherently difficult because they are unintentional , " she said during the hearing			0
" i 'm walking out of here , " @entity16 told reporters after her sentencing tuesday			2
" i do n't think you could be more satisfied			0
" @entity16 told @entity103 's " today " on monday that the jurors who convicted her probably could n't relate to her because she is a single mother and they do n't regularly use public transportation or need to walk on busy streets			1
many members of the public , however , supported her			0
" your office 's decision to prosecute @entity10 for the death of her 4 - year - old son on a vehicular homicide charge is disgusting and inhumane , " one poster wrote on the @entity108 page of the @entity13 solicitor @entity109 , which handled the case			1
more than 135,000 people signed an online petition calling for leniency			0
the @entity15 had called the case against @entity16 a " grave miscarriage of justice when the mother who is still grieving is forced to fight harder for her freedom than the man who killed her son			1
" the case also attracted attention from transportation advocates , who said @entity16 was treated unfairly because transportation planners fail to take into account the needs of pedestrians when designing roads			2
" because she did as her fellow bus riders , who crossed at the same time and same place , and because she did what pedestrians will do every time -- take the shortest reasonable path -- she is guilty of vehicular homicide , " transportation for @entity146 communications director @entity145 wrote on the advocacy organization 's blog			2
@entity0 's @entity149 and @entity151 's @entity150 contributed to this report .			0
