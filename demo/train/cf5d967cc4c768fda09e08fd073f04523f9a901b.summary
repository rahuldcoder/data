@entity0 , @entity1 -- amid increasing optimism that a deal could be within reach , @entity4 secretary of state @entity3 is heading to @entity0 to help in negotiations over @entity10 's nuclear program			1
@entity3 will fly to @entity0 on friday " in an effort to help narrow differences in negotiations " with @entity10 , two senior @entity12 officials said			1
@entity18 high representative @entity17 invited @entity3 to the talks , the officials said			1
news of @entity3 's travel plans came hours after @entity10 's foreign minister said that officials could reach an agreement by friday evening			1
" i believe it is possible to reach an understanding or an agreement before we close these negotiations ( friday ) evening , " @entity10 's foreign minister and chief nuclear negotiator , @entity27 , told @entity2 's @entity28			1
though he would not detail what such an agreement could include , he told the state - run @entity36 , " we expect to make a breakthrough			0
" @entity4 president @entity38 also said thursday night that a deal could be reached			1
there is the " possibility of a phased agreement " with @entity10 on nuclear issues , @entity38 told @entity44			1
the first step , if agreed upon , would require @entity10 to halt advances in its nuclear program in return for " very modest relief " from economic sanctions , he said			1
but the @entity4 would still keep " core sanctions " in place , @entity38 said			2
" so that if it turned out during the course of the six months when we 're trying to resolve some of these bigger issues that they 're backing out of the deal , they 're not following through on it , or they 're not willing to go forward and finish the job of giving us assurances that they 're not developing a nuclear weapon , " @entity38 told @entity44 , " we can crank that dial back up			2
" the comments came after a day of meetings in @entity0 between @entity10 negotiators and technical teams from the @entity4 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and non-nuclear - armed @entity73 -- a group referred to as the @entity75 or @entity76			1
uranium enrichment is the key issue on the table during the talks with @entity10 over the future of its controversial nuclear program			1
" we are at a very sensitive stage of negotiations , and it is best if these negotiations are done at the negotiating table rather than on live television , " @entity27 said			2
" but i can tell you that we are prepared to address some of the most immediate concerns that have been raised , and we expect reciprocally our concerns to be met by the @entity75			0
" @entity10 negotiator : various issues on the table the framework has been agreed to , he said			2
" i hope by tomorrow morning we can start serious work in order to prepare some sort of a joint statement			0
" it would address an end game " that we all try to reach within a limited period of time , hopefully in less than a year " and a series of actions that both sides would take reciprocally " in order to build confidence and address the most immediate concerns , " he said			0
many of those concerns center on @entity10 's nuclear ambitions , which some countries worry seek a nuclear weapon , an assertion that @entity118 has denied			2
@entity27 said the nuclear program would continue -- in some form			2
" there wo n't be a suspension of our enrichment program in its entirety , " he said			0
" but we can deal with various issues , various issues are on the table			0
" the concerns of each side have been dealt with , he said			0
@entity27 said @entity132 's assumption of the presidency in august has opened a window of opportunity that needs to be seized			2
he acknowledged that international sanctions have resulted in economic hardship for @entity10 , but said they represent a failed policy			2
" instead of 160 centrifuges that were spinning 10 years ago or eight years ago , today we have 19,000 centrifuges , " he said			0
" so that is what sanctions and pressures and intimidation has brought these people who are continuing to advocate that type of behavior			0
" @entity4 officials outline possible deal two senior @entity4 administration officials said a deal on @entity10 's nuclear program is in the works			1
one of the officials said the deal is designed to " stop @entity10 's progress by stopping the shortening of time by which they could build a nuclear weapon " while also providing temporary , reversible sanctions relief to @entity10			1
that official cautioned the deal is not done , but said it could happen if the @entity10 agree to the @entity75 's demands			2
they said that , under the potential deal , @entity10 would agree : -- to stop enriching nuclear fuel to 20 % purity ; -- to render unusable most of its existing stockpile of such fuel ; -- to agree not to use advanced @entity177 centrifuges , which can enrich nuclear fuel five times faster than older centrifuges ; -- not to activate a plutonium reactor at @entity182			2
in turn , the @entity75 would agree : -- to unfreeze some @entity10 assets held in banks overseas ; -- possibly to consider easing sanctions banning trade in gold , precious metals and petrochemicals			0
other sweeteners were also under consideration , they said			0
the officials added that the measures could be reimposed if @entity10 did not comply with its end of any bargain			1
' getting to the root of the problem ' the details were hashed out during a bilateral @entity4 - @entity10 meeting -- part of an apparent effort on each side to mend fences -- which lasted about an hour on the sidelines of broader talks under way in @entity0			1
the @entity4 delegation was led by under secretary of state @entity210			0
the @entity10 delegation was led by deputy foreign minister @entity213			0
@entity10 talks : do we want a deal or a war ? " the main issue is getting to the root of the problem , which is the enrichment issue and all things that lead from that , " @entity218 , spokesman for @entity219 , said on the sidelines of negotiations			1
@entity10 's supreme leader ' not optimistic ' about nuclear talks moments later , the @entity10 state - run @entity228 tweeted a quote from @entity213 : " enrichment is our red line and its suspension is unacceptable			1
" when @entity2 asked @entity213 about the issue of uranium enrichment , he declined to answer			1
" the talks are extremely complex and are now going into a serious phase , " @entity218 said			0
" we want to focus on substance and hope there will be concrete progress over the next couple of days			0
" @entity242 nuclear watchdog : program could have ' military dimensions ' @entity4 official : we think @entity10 wants a nuclear deal -- and fast the @entity4 and its partners have accused @entity10 of diverting resources from its civilian nuclear program to try to develop a nuclear bomb			0
@entity10 has repeatedly denied those assertions and says it has no desire to build nuclear weapons			0
resolutions and sanctions passed by the @entity242 in 2006 called on @entity10 to halt all enrichment activities and clarify that its nuclear facilities were being used for peaceful purposes only			1
in its august report , the @entity242 nuclear watchdog , the @entity262 , estimates that since declaring its nuclear program , @entity10 has processed 10 metric tons of uranium to 5 % purity , the level used for nuclear power plants			1
the @entity262 estimates that @entity10 has a stockpile of 185 kilograms of uranium at 20 % purity			1
weapons experts warn that this uranium could be further refined for use in a nuclear warhead			0
although experts suggest that amount would not be enough for a single warhead , the @entity262 has warned that it believes @entity10 's nuclear program could have " possible military dimensions			0
" @entity2 's @entity281 reported from @entity0			0
@entity2 's @entity282 reported from @entity283 .			0

@entity38 : there is the " possibility of a phased agreement "
