@entity0 -- few @entity2 have any real idea how the @entity4 operates , since cameras are barred , and the case arguments and opinions are often dry and confusing for nonlawyers			1
that 's too bad because the high court 's impact on @entity2 is incalculable			1
when disputes arise , the nine justices serve as the final word for a nation built on the rule of law			2
they interpret the @entity18 and all that it brings with it : how we conduct ourselves in society , boundaries for individuals and the government , questions literally of life and death			0
as the late justice @entity33 once wrote , " the law is not an end in itself , nor does it provide ends			2
it is preeminently a means to serve what we think is right			0
" and whether right or wrong , when it came to deciding who won the 2000 presidential election , it was the court 's conclusions that ultimately ended the issue , but not the controversy			1
preview : ' the implications ... are impossible to overstate ' a similarly epic constitutional showdown is now before the court over challenges to the health care reform law promoted by congressional @entity51 and president @entity52 -- and opposed by a coalition of 26 states			1
@entity58 of the @entity18 says , " the judicial power of the @entity2 , shall be vested in one supreme court ... the judges , both of the supreme and inferior courts , shall hold their offices during good behavior			2
" read a transcript of monday 's court arguments on health care here 's a look at the history of the court , how it works and how you , the citizen , can interact with it : @entity4 goes back the late 1700s the @entity4 first met in 1790 , as the ultimate part of the judicial branch of government			1
there are nine justices , led by the chief justice of the @entity2 ( that 's the official title )			1
all justices -- and all federal judges -- are first nominated by the president and must be confirmed by the @entity84			1
they serve for as long as they choose			0
the court has occupied its current building in @entity0 only since 1935			2
previously , it borrowed space in @entity84 chambers in the @entity92			0
the @entity18 's framers envisioned the judiciary as the " weakest , " " least dangerous " branch of government			2
and while the court has often been accused over the years of being too timid in asserting its power , there is little doubt when the justices choose to flex their judicial muscle , the results can be far - reaching			1
just look at how cases such as @entity106 ( 1954 -- integrating public schools ) , @entity108 ( 1973 -- legalizing abortion ) and even @entity110 ( 2000 ) have affected the lives of @entity2			1
blockbuster decisions by the high court over the years traditionally , each term begins the first monday in october , and final opinions are issued usually by late june			1
justices divide their time between " sittings , " where they hear cases and issue decisions , and " recesses , " where they meet in private to write their decisions and consider other business before the court			1
court arguments are open to the public in the main courtroom , and visitors have the option of watching all the arguments or only a small portion			1
you will notice the justices wearing black robes , and quill pins still adorn the desks , as they have for more than two centuries			2
where to sit ? seniority counts the justices are seated by seniority , with the chief justice in the middle			1
the two junior justices ( currently @entity145 and @entity146 ) occupy the opposite ends of the bench			2
before public arguments and private conferences , where decisions are discussed , the nine members all shake hands as a show of harmony of purpose			2
in the past , all lawyers appearing before the court wore formal " morning clothes , " but today only federal government lawyers carry on the tradition			2
the solicitor general is the federal government 's principal lawyer before the federal bench			2
as the gavel sounds and justices are seated , the marshal shouts the traditional welcome , which reads : " oyez ! oyez ! oyez ! all persons having business before the honorable , the @entity4 , are admonished to draw near and give their attention , for the court is now sitting			1
@entity174 save the @entity2 and this @entity175			0
" @entity176 asked questions about the court and the case arguments usually begin at 10 a.m. and since most cases involve appellate review of decisions by other courts , there are no juries or witnesses , just lawyers from both sides addressing the bench			0
the cases usually last about an hour , and lawyers from both sides very often have their prepared oral briefs interrupted by pointed questions from a justice			0
this give - and - take , question - and - answer repartee can be entertaining , and it requires lawyers to think concisely and logically on their feet			0
and by the tone of their questioning , it often gives insight into a justice 's thinking , a barometer of his / her decision - making			1
you can listen if you like no cameras are allowed , but the public sessions are audio recorded , and are available for listening , usually several days later			1
the health care arguments -- for this week -- will be available only shortly after each of the four separate arguments end , at the court 's website			1
after the arguments , conferences are scheduled , where justices discuss and vote on the cases			0
in these closed - door sessions , the nine members are alone			0
no clerks or staff are allowed			0
no transcripts of their remarks are kept , and it is the role of the junior justice ( @entity146 for the past two years ) to take notes and answer any inquiries from the outside			0
justices spend much of their time reviewing the cases and writing opinions			0
and they must decide which cases they will actually hear in open court			0
when asked just before her 2006 retirement what the jurists do most of the time , @entity241 said bluntly , " we read			0
we read on average 1,500 pages a day			0
" added justice @entity247 : " we try to squeeze in a little time for thinking			0
" want your case heard ? do n't get your hopes up each week , the court receives more than 150 petitions for review , decisions by lower courts appealed to the high court			2
relatively few are granted full review			0
about 8,000 to 10,000 such petitions go on the court 's docket each term			1
only 75 to 85 cases -- about 1 % -- are accepted			1
oral arguments will then be scheduled , but final opinions may not be written in all such appeals			0
in addition , some 1,200 legal applications of various types are filed each year that can be acted on by a single justice			0
those include stays of executions			0
the rulings are handed out in both written and electronic form , but the justice writing the majority opinion will usually deliver an oral summary at the beginning of a public session			1
in extraordinary occasions , the lead dissenting justice can demand equal time with an oral rebuttal			0
the court 's opinions are final			1
the only exception is the court itself , which can over time overturn its own precedent , as it did with racial segregation			0
but most justices rely on the principle of " stare decisis , " @entity295 for " to stand by a decision , " where a current court should be bound by previous rulings			2
case arguments and the opinions are posted on the @entity2 @entity4 's web site : @entity302 .			1

@entity4 's in session : the marshal shouts the traditional welcome -- " oyez ! oyez ! oyez ! "
the justices are seated by seniority , with the chief justice in the middle
no cameras are allowed , but the public sessions are audio recorded
up to 10,000 petitions go to court 's docket each term ; only about 1 % are accepted
