-- @entity1 scored twice and strike partner @entity2 also found the net as @entity4 recovered from going a goal behind to beat @entity6 3 - 1 in the first leg of their @entity9 last 16 tie			1
after @entity11 's 4 - 0 thumping in @entity12 last week , @entity6 had an ideal opportunity to restore some pride for @entity16 clubs against @entity18 opposition			2
and they got off to a superb start on a wet evening in southern @entity20 , by taking a 27th - minute lead			2
@entity23 - @entity6 owners backing me in private @entity26 broke on the right for the visitors but his ball into the penalty area should have been dealt with by the @entity4 defense			1
however , @entity32 sliced his attempted clearance up in the air and @entity36 international @entity35 was lurking behind the defender to side - foot his shot past goalkeeper @entity40			0
however , both defenses looked vulnerable in difficult conditions and it was no surprise when the home side leveled just 11 minutes later			0
@entity45 striker @entity1 collected the ball on the edge of the box and jinked inside @entity6 's @entity49 before curling a sublime shot into the corner of @entity53 's net			2
and , @entity4 completed their turnaround in stoppage time at the end of the first half when @entity60 's deep cross was bundled home by @entity2 , who had drifted in behind the @entity6 defense			1
both sides wasted opportunities to score in an end - to - end second half , but it was @entity4 who found the net again with a third goal in the 65th minute			0
@entity70 failed to deal with a long ball out of the @entity4 defense and allowed @entity2 to nip ahead of him			0
the @entity73 did superbly to steady himself and slide the ball across for the on - rushing @entity1 to stroke him his second to double @entity4 's lead			1
a poor night for @entity6 could have become worse late on , when @entity80 's goalline clearance deprived @entity81 of scoring a fourth goal which would surely have sealed @entity4 's qualification into the quarterfinals			1
@entity6 have now gone five matches without a victory as speculation continues over the future of under - pressure manager @entity89			0
and the result also means the very real possibility of no @entity16 sides reaching the last eight of the competition for the first time since 1996 .			0

@entity1 nets a double as @entity4 come from behind to defeat @entity6 3 - 1 in @entity20
@entity2 scores @entity4 's other goal after @entity35 had given @entity6 the lead
the result means @entity103 are in *danger* of having no teams in the @entity9 last eight
