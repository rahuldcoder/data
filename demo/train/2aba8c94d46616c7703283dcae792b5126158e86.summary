-- for many , the creative relevance of @entity3 cinema remains very much an open question			0
but when the history of @entity8 's 21st century embrace of @entity3 is written , it very well may point to this weekend as the moment when the format definitively established its commercial power at the box office			1
" @entity14 " scared up by far the most box office receipts , banking $ 28.3 million			1
despite a moviegoing weekend dominated with @entity17 - rated violent thriller - type films ostensibly shooting for the same audience , " @entity14 " scared up by far the most box office receipts , banking $ 28.3 million for an easy no. 1 berth , according to early estimates from @entity21			1
that 's almost $ 10 million better than the opening frame for the last film in the creatively - dispatching - model - perfect - unknown - actors franchise ( which , for those keeping track , was " @entity28 " )			2
there 's really only one reason why : although just over half its 3,121 theaters were screening the flick in @entity3 , fully 70 percent of its box office take was from @entity3 theaters , which typically charge an extra few bucks per ticket for the privilege of watching the film with those comfy stereoscopic glasses			1
rest assured , despite its title ( and its abysmal " c " cinemascore grade ) , this is by no means the final " @entity47 " movie			0
the folks at the @entity49 , meanwhile , continue to enjoy good news for their much scrutinized bottom line : @entity56 's " @entity55 " landed at no. 2 with a rather spectacular $ 20 million , just 47 percent down from its opening weekend for $ 73.7 million total			1
@entity49 's sister company @entity57 , meanwhile , saw its " @entity59 " debut at third with a nothing - to - sneeze - at $ 17.4 million			2
granted , director @entity61 's second re-imagining of the 31 - years - old slasher franchise made nothing close to the $ 30.6 million @entity65 weekend debut of @entity61 's first night out with @entity66			2
but given the steep competition , and the film 's $ 15 million budget , dimension must be breathing a sigh of relief that their film will most likely see a decent profit			0
the box office love continued through much of the weekend 's top 10 : @entity77 dropped just 41 percent with $ 10.7 million , strong enough to hold on at fourth place and , with a $ 90.8 mil running total , well on its way to joining the $ 100 million club			1
at number five , " @entity83 : the @entity86 " banged out $ 8 million , a 34 percent drop and $ 132 million total			1
and @entity87 savored a tiny 16 percent drop for sixth , with $ 7.4 million in its forth weekend for $ 70.9 million total			0
in fact , the only true disappointment for the weekend was @entity94 ' " taking @entity93			0
" director @entity96 's trip back to the iconic three - day concert debuted at ninth with just $ 3.7 million , doubly disappointing since it opened wide in 1,393 theaters ( after a wednesday opening in @entity101 and @entity102 ) , with a feeble $ 2,691 per theater average			0
by contrast , two limited release debuts did rather well : vogue magazine documentary " @entity113 " bowed on six screens with a very fashionable $ 40,000 per theater average ; and the extreme - sports - fandom - gone - wrong dramedy " @entity107 " won $ 13,000 per theater on two screens			0
