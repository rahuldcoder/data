-- it 's happened to all of us : you print something from the @entity5 , and all you get is a sheet of paper with nothing but a url or something equally useless			0
new software is designed to prevent printing blank pages from the @entity5 , its inventor says			1
this printing pain in the neck happened to @entity17 so much that he invented a solution : @entity19 , software that analyzes what a computer sends to a printer			1
it looks for pages that have no type or just a few lines of type ( users can set the parameters )			1
then , the software automatically eliminates these pages from the print job			1
users can reselect the pages if desired and deselect any other pages they do n't want to print -- say , the pages of legal jargon at the end of an airline reservation			1
the software lets users eliminate images from a print job -- for instance , the maps generated in online driving directions -- thus saving ink			2
@entity19 also allows users to avoid printing altogether by saving documents as @entity50 files			2
" the average employee prints about 10,000 pages a year , and roughly 20 percent of that is waste , " @entity17 said from his @entity19 office in the @entity53 section of @entity54 , @entity55			2
" we estimate if [ @entity19 ] got into widespread use , in the @entity63 alone it would save tens of millions of trees a year and hundreds of millions of pounds " of polluting carbon - dioxide gases			1
@entity66 , a vice president at the @entity68 architectural firm , heard about @entity19 from bloggers and decided to give it a try			0
" i 'm an architect by education and print a lot of large drawings as well as a lot of documents , " she said from her @entity72 office			0
" so the ability i have to self - select just a little bit saves a lot of paper fast			0
" with @entity19 , it takes a few extra seconds to print			0
but , @entity85 said , " in a way , that 's a good thing , because you take that pause and decide if you really wanted to print it or not			0
" @entity19 tells users how many pages , and how much money , they have saved			1
@entity85 said that based on a rate of 6½ cents per page , she paid off the $ 35 cost of the software in one day			1
but now , @entity19 is offering a free version of the software for non-business use , supported by advertising			2
tens of thousands of people have downloaded the program in the weeks since its january 28 debut			0
" our goal is nothing short of ending wasteful printing worldwide , " @entity17 said			2
the @entity111 , a member of the @entity113 , is using @entity19 in a pilot project , sending feedback to the company to help fine - tune the software for the corporation 's needs			1
and @entity17 said that more than two dozen @entity121 companies are testing out the product			1
he 's hopeful that several deals will be closed this year			0
so , is @entity17 getting rich off this ? " not yet , " he said with a laugh			0
" it 's still early days , but hopefully over the next couple of years i 'll start at least making a salary			0

it might save millions of trees , millions of pounds of pollution , *creator* says
