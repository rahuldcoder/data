-- car giant @entity1 is shifting up a gear in its efforts to tap @entity5 's emerging middle class			1
@entity6 , managing director of @entity1 @entity5 , said the auto manufacturer sells one out of three premium cars in the country			1
he now wants the company to replicate the successful @entity5 model in other parts of the continent			1
" we clearly see that there is a growing middle class coming through in @entity5 and that there is a lot of interest in development and we assume that the middle class as we have seen it in @entity5 is growing and there is purchasing power and there is a demand for our cars as well , " he told @entity0 's @entity14			2
last week , @entity1 unveiled plans to increase the production capacity at its @entity31 - based @entity30 plant , the company 's first production facility outside @entity34 , built in 1973			2
the move is expected to enable @entity1 to double its exports from the country -- @entity6 says that 80 % of the cars produced at the plant are exported to countries across the world			1
an edited version of the interview follows			0
@entity0 : what is it about @entity5 that you find good and what are the challenges of working in this country ? @entity6 : we are proud to have a plant here in @entity5 which is a member of the @entity1 production network and we are proud that we are able to deliver the same quality			1
certainly there are always challenges , there are challenges all around the whole world and if you talk in @entity5 about challenges , it 's a skills issue , it 's the supplier base , it 's education of the people , it 's logistics and everything but so far we were able to deal with this and to overcome this and we have a successful future ahead as we are planning to double the production volume in this plant			1
@entity0 : logistics -- getting the cars out -- how difficult is it , particularly with a port like @entity76 for example ? see also : long delays at @entity5 's busiest port @entity80 : it 's a challenge , especially if you 're talking about the @entity76 port , if you have the lowest efficiency and the highest prices for your port operation it 's not a good position to be in			2
so , @entity5 needs to change this and there have been measures taken at least to talk about and to bring it forward			2
we need efficient ports but we just do not need @entity76 alone -- i would say we need in @entity97 sufficient ports , we need to have one in @entity98 , maybe in @entity99 and we need to have an infrastructure which links these ports to each other -- it 's all about proper infrastructure in order to get production volumes which are increasing out of the country to our customers			0

( that ) certain improvements will be done and i trust that this will come through			0
@entity0 : from your point of view , has this been one of the things that has kept you awake at night , how to get the cars of this country ? @entity80 : yes , we have fantastic cars , we produce them with the right quality and we should have a very smooth process in a combination between transit and the port operation to get them out as quickly as possible and this is what we 're working for			0
@entity0 : how has the euro crisis impacted the @entity1 globally ? @entity80 : we have not been affected directly , it 's more a financial crisis than an industrial crisis			1
it 's very important that we have a successful euro and from a @entity34 point of view -- talking for a @entity34 - based company with a lot of international operations -- it 's very important , as we are a big exporter , to have a common currency			0

@entity80 : the majority of the cars , 80 per cent to be exact , is exported around the world -- main markets are the @entity161 states , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , all these kind of countries			0
@entity0 : and @entity5 ? @entity80 : we sell through the whole @entity5 continent , i think 33,000 or 35,000 cars , the majority of this certainly in @entity5 at the moment			0
in @entity5 we are clearly the leader in the premium car segment , one out of three premium cars is a @entity1			1
yes , it 's different if we go north in @entity5 because we are not selling so many cars over there -- we have a huge market in @entity181 and we have importers who sell our cars through @entity5 , but what we do now ( is ) we try to use the model which we have used in @entity5 to increase our footprint			0
@entity0 : why are you taking this decision now ? @entity80 : it 's that we clearly see that there is a growing middle class coming through in @entity5 and that there is a lot of interest in development and we assume that the middle class as we have seen it in @entity5 is growing and there is purchasing power and there is a demand for our cars as well			0
