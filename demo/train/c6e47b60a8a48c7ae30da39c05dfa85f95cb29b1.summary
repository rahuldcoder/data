@entity0 , @entity1 -- the glow from the @entity4 still is wonderfully blinding on bright days			1
@entity5 , the nickname of the skyscraper - sized mural on the side of the @entity10 , continues to inspire with its version of @entity5 stretching his arms high and wide as a football referee signaling for a touchdown			0
the @entity16 of @entity17 , where folks have n't stopped lighting candles for miracles			0
the basilica of the @entity23 , which resembles something straight from the @entity25			0
the immaculate trees , with leaves that dance in the autumn wind while dressed in various october colors			0
for a guy born and raised a few punts away from all of this on the campus of the @entity35 , i keep hearing a depressing question : is @entity39 football relevant anymore ? the answer is yes , definitely yes			1
" talent-wise , we 're pretty much there , because players keep coming here to be great , and they know there is life after football when they choose to play for @entity39 , " said @entity41 , now a senior financial analyst , who had several gigantic catches as a wide receiver for the @entity44 during the late 1980s and early 1990s			1
those were the last of @entity39 's glory days			2
thus the question of relevancy			0
" i live in @entity58 , and i hear that question all the time , " @entity41 said , chuckling , while many @entity57 eyes are crying			0
here 's why : with @entity39 spending another season tumbling into obscurity , there are more than a few reasons to doubt its relevancy			2
for one , this 125 - year - old football program that made dominance famous has n't won a national championship since 1988 , when that other @entity69 was in the @entity70			1
the original @entity69 was @entity69 , @entity39 's icon of yore			2
years after legendary @entity39 coach @entity73 satisfied the wishes of a dying @entity69 by delivering his " win one for the @entity69 " speech before a @entity39 game against @entity81 during the 1920s , @entity69 was portrayed in @entity75 by future @entity77 president @entity76			1
that @entity69 speech was about the last time @entity39 won a bowl game worth mentioning			2
actually , we 're talking about 1993 , when @entity41 helped @entity39 beat @entity87 in the @entity88			2
after that , the @entity44 dropped a @entity90 ( @entity90 ) record nine - straight bowl games , spanning from the mighty @entity92 to the lowly insight			2
they 've won their last two bowl games , but nobody who participates in either the @entity96 or the @entity97 is considered a national power			0
they 've had four coaches since @entity102 inductee @entity101 resigned after the 1996 season			0
three of those @entity106 coaches were fired , and the fourth is @entity108 , whose team in his second year at @entity39 had a disturbing 31 - 17 home loss last saturday to archrival @entity111 it dropped @entity39 's record to a sloppy 4 - 3			2
of the 120 schools at the top of the @entity90 's two - tier system , 119 of them have a better turnover margin than the @entity44			2
worse , @entity111 players accused @entity39 players and coaches of quitting during saturday 's game			1
@entity111 coach @entity122 apologized to @entity108 for the remarks , and @entity108 joined @entity39 players in denying the charges			1
then again , those things happen when the mighty has become the meek in the minds of many			0
" for anybody to say that @entity39 ca n't win again is the most ridiculous , asinine comment i 've ever heard , because they 've got more going for them now than they 've ever had before in the history of the school , " said @entity101 , 74 , now a college football analyst for @entity129			0
he finished his 11 years at @entity39 with a 100 - 30 - 2 record , featuring that 1988 national championship and three other seasons with one loss or less			1
@entity101 's legacy at @entity39 is even more astounding when you consider the following : back then , @entity39 officials did n't allow " red shirting , " which gives players a chance to spend an extra year with a team while retaining their normal four years of eligibility			1
@entity101 had several five - year players at @entity39 , but that mostly was because they were exempt for medical reasons			1
now , even though @entity39 officials do n't call it red shirting , they allow five - years players for a variety of reasons			1
there also is @entity39 's change in recent years to allow freshmen to enter the university in january instead of september			1
it has expanded the @entity44 's recruiting possibilities			0
then there is the acceptance of transfers			0
it was discouraged for academic reasons during the @entity101 era , except in rare cases			0
transfers happen slightly more frequently these days at @entity39			0
@entity167 , former @entity39 coach @entity168 and his strength coaches often complained about players suffering huge weight losses near the end of seasons			1
because of football and @entity39 's fierce academic schedule , players were n't eating properly			1
unlike other major programs , @entity39 lacked a training table , which allows players to eat structured meals each day around class and practice times			1
@entity39 finally got a training table during @entity168 ' last year there in 2009 , and since then , players have enjoyed meals at the @entity44 's state - of - the - art football complex that was built across 96,000 square feet in 2005			1
that was nearly a decade after @entity101 's era			0
with its multiple fields , extensive weight - training area and huge locker rooms featuring the latest in technology , the so - called @entity189 complex ( nicknamed @entity190 ) is eye candy for recruits			0
in other words , those who keep saying the @entity44 ca n't recruit anymore are n't paying attention			0
they had more players ( 11 ) on preseason " watch lists " this year for major individual awards than any team outside of @entity206 ( 12 )			0
wide receiver @entity207 and linebacker @entity208 are among several @entity39 players tagged as future high picks in the @entity212 draft			1
speaking of the future , there were around 50 of the nation 's top recruits at the @entity111 game , and despite the @entity44 's ugly loss , the @entity218 reported that most of the recruits said they were highly impressed with the @entity39 atmosphere			1
" in the end , @entity108 will figure it out , just the same as @entity227 did and every other coach before him , " said @entity101 , referring to @entity39 's legacy that has produced 11 national championships and seven @entity225 winners under the likes of @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity73 and , of course , @entity101			2
what @entity108 must do to join them at @entity39 is win , and he must do so for just shy of forever			0

@entity0 , @entity1 , native @entity237 : players come to @entity39 " to be great "
@entity44 remain relevant , despite lack of national championship for 23 years , he says
several @entity39 players are *speculated* as future high picks in the @entity212 draft
