-- whether you are shooting with a dslr or a smartphone , one goal all photographers strive for is photographing a scene that quickly gets to the heart of the story without explanation or embellishment			1
so how do you do that ? well , the answer does n't always lie with a fancy camera			1
excellent visual communication is primarily driven by your unique visual sense , the time spent shooting and a deep connection to the story			1
in essence , you must do more than take pictures			2
images that transcend snapshots require extra effort			1
once you 've gone through the above gallery and learned how to compose your images , you may find the following tips helpful to take your photojournalism skills to the next level			1
personal projects when i meet someone trying to break into photojournalism , i try to get a grasp of their motivation and inspiration			2
one of the best ways to do this is to have them show me personal pictures , frames they made that were not for an immediate assignment			1
it is important to photograph things you care about , even if they may be insignificant to others			2
what matters is that you get invested in a subject and continue to photograph it over time			2
this is considered a personal project			2
almost every story i have done for @entity0 was a subject i was interested in and pitched to the editors			1
for starters , i recommend choosing something simple			2
i have seen terrific projects that people have done on their relatives or friends , or on the places they live or hobbies they enjoy			2
you should photograph every aspect of your project			2
get the details and get the wide shots that show the entire scene			1
by dedicating yourself to a project , you 'll become more in tune with the way your camera works			2
you 'll also begin to understand how to tell a story and how to make informative pictures			2
a personal project will not only improve your photography skills , it will also prepare you to capture breaking news when it unfolds			1
one lens it is no secret that most photographers love gear , but it is easy to get bogged down worrying that you do n't have the right gear for the job , or maybe you feel like you could do a better job if you just had that one other thing			2
i disagree with this premise			2
photojournalism is about the subject , not about the camera			2
whatever you shoot with , if you find the moment or composition that tells the story , then you 've done well			0
many of the greatest photojournalists have worked with very minimal gear			1
i personally shoot the majority of my work with one lens , roughly a 35mm			0
it is great for getting close to the subject and allowing me to show bits of the environment they are in			1
if you focus on mastering whatever equipment you have at your disposal , then you 'll be better prepared for whatever news situation you encounter			0
spend time learning all of the options that you can get from a specific lens , and then you 'll find you are able to think less about the equipment and more about subject			0
start by figuring out how close you can focus with your favorite lens , then practice shooting tight			0
take a few steps back to shoot a wider environmental portrait			0
finally , get as far back as you can to show the scene and try different angles on your subject			1
you 'll find each lens is extremely versatile and you 're only limited by how you can navigate the scene			0
after you get comfortable with composition , you need to learn how your aperture ( and exposure ) can help you tell the story			0
shooting wide open , using aperture f2.8 on most lenses , gives you a shallow depth of field that emphasizes the part of the images you are focused on			1
a good example might be focusing on a single person , isolating him from a crowd			0
stopping down , using a smaller aperture like f11 , or f16 , will give you a maximum depth of field , which can help to show a wider scene like devastation from a tornado			1
smartphone photography one essential part of being a photojournalist is having access to a camera that shoots large enough files to be useful			1
for many professionals , this means a few heavy , expensive dslrs with an array of lenses and other equipment			0
but for many , this type of photo equipment is out of reach , so point - and - shoot cameras or camera phones are a viable alternative			0
for small cameras , the same principles of good photography apply			1
thoughtful composition , proper exposure and excellent storytelling will help your images get noticed			1
the smaller cameras do have a few challenges that need to be addressed			1
because many of these cameras shoot only in an automatic metering mode , it is more critical that you know how the camera function works			0
camera phones are small and lightweight , which makes them easy to carry and unobtrusive to use in chaotic situations , but this also makes them more difficult to hold steady			0
consider purchasing a small , flexible tripod , and use it when the light levels are lower			0
also , hold and release the " shutter " button , rather than tap it			0
this will reduce the amount of camera shake			0
shoot in bright light with the sun to your back			0
this will solve many of the technical limitations of a camera phone			0
your pocket is not really the cleanest place to keep your camera			0
do n't use the digital zoom			0
the digital zoom crops the images , reducing the file size and the overall quality of the image			1
set your resolution as high as possible			0
you can always reduce the file size later			0
shoot lots , and edit out the poor images			1
the more you shoot , the more choice you have when editing			0
go easy of the photo editing apps			0
tools such as @entity219 and @entity220 are fun to play with and can lend a certain personalization to your images , but they can harm or destroy the journalistic integrity of your images			1
as a rule , image alteration should not change the content of the image			0
technical alterations , such as color correction or contrast change , are acceptable as long as they do not change the content of the photograph			0
