-- the second inaugural address is always more difficult than the first			0
when a president - elect first steps onto the national stage , he still enjoys a certain degree of innocence and hope			0
@entity10 are waiting to see if the new president will be different			1
when a new president delivers his speech , voters do n't yet have a record that might make them cynical			1
but by the second term , voters are familiar , and often tired , with the occupant of the @entity19			0
even though they liked him more than his opponents , the president has usually been through some pretty tough battles and his limitations have been exposed			0
it becomes much harder to deliver big promises , when the people watching have a much clearer sense of your limitations and of the strength of your opponents			0
so president @entity33 faces a big test when he appears before the nation monday			1
opinion : presidents should n't swear in on a @entity38 @entity33 now is @entity39 , and no longer someone who will be able to shake up the way @entity39 works			2
voters believe that @entity42 is dysfunctional and have little confidence that legislators will respond to his proposals			0
overseas , the instability and violence in the @entity49 has shaken the confidence of many @entity10 that @entity33 can achieve the kind of transformative change he promised back in 2009			1
@entity33 , who is a student of history , can look back at some past second inaugural addresses if he wants guidance			1
three of the best of these addresses offer a roadmap			0
@entity60 , march 4 , 1865 : the strongest was from @entity60 , who gave his talk amid the brutality of the @entity63 but chose to stress the theme of healing and unity , @entity60 gave a masterful performance that offered inspiration and encouragement for the reunification of the nation			2
@entity60 famously said : " with malice toward none , with charity for all , with firmness in the right as @entity77 gives us to see the right , let us strive on to finish the work we are in , to bind up the nation 's wounds , to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan , to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations			2
" rather than boasting of military victory or threatening @entity94 forces , he stepped outside the battle to offer the nation , as a whole , the path forward			0
@entity98 , march 5 , 1917 : although @entity98 had run on a campaign to keep @entity10 out of world war , he was aware that such intervention was inevitable			1
during his second inaugural address , @entity98 took the opportunity to start preparing the nation for what was about to come			1
he told @entity10 to think about the global responsibilities it had to accept , even if much of the nation was not prepared to do so			2
" we are provincials no longer , " he said , " the tragic events of the thirty months of vital turmoil which we have just passed have made us citizens of the world			0
there can be no turning back			0
" opinion : why ' @entity115 ' remains unsung @entity117 , january 20 , 1937 : @entity117 gave a rousing performance that outlined the fundamental vision which shaped the wide array of policies he had put forward in his first term			1
while many people had criticized @entity117 for lacking any ideology and for being a pragmatist without principle , in his second address he explained the rationale behind his actions : " i see millions denied education , recreation , and the opportunity to better their lot and the lot of their children			2
i see one - third of a nation ill - housed , ill - clad , ill - nourished			0
" for @entity141 , the speech remains a powerful defense of government and the rationale behind his program			0
to replicate some of this success , @entity33 will need to figure out how to inspire a nation that is frustrated by the gridlock of @entity39 and the laggard state of the economy and worried about instability overseas			2
@entity33 can learn from all three of these presidents			1
like @entity98 , he can talk to @entity10 about goals they should aspire to achieve , ways in which the country can accept new obligations in a changing world			1
like @entity60 , he can urge the nation to move beyond the discord and division that have characterized political debate in the past four years			1
finally , like @entity117 , he can use his speech to provide some of the justification and outlook that has shaped his policies			2
this would undercut the ability of @entity170 to define his policies for him , as has been the case for much of his first term , and motivate supporters who have often felt that @entity33 remained too much of a mystery			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			0

@entity177 : second term inaugural addresses are always a *challenge*
he says the public has had four years to make a judgment about the president
@entity33 can learn from second term speeches of @entity60 , @entity98 , @entity117
@entity177 says they did a good job of unifying @entity10 and sketching vision of the *future*
