@entity0 , @entity1 -- misery hates company			2
following the nuclear power plant crisis in @entity6 , @entity1 has ordered safety inspections of its existing nuclear plants and suspension of new plant approvals			1
the decision was made on march 16 during a meeting of premier @entity13 with the @entity14 , @entity1 's cabinet			2
" development of nuclear power must put safety the top priority , " the government said on its website			1
@entity0 's top nuclear power regulatory body quickly unveiled a series of guidelines advising nuclear power plants to take disaster stress tests on planned and existing projects			1
@entity27 , the @entity1 director of @entity28 , a non-profit group advocating environmental protection , applauded the decision			0
" they are reviewing and reassessing nuclear power plants , " she says			1
" i believe they are going to find a lot of issues there			0
" read whether the fear for nuclear disasters is realistic @entity1 operates 13 nuclear reactors , a small number compared to the 104 in the @entity41 , but @entity1 is poised to catch up			1
it 's building more than two dozen others -- roughly 40 percent of all the reactors under construction worldwide -- and 50 more are being proposed			1
read more special coverage on @entity1 such an aggressive nuclear power program is understandable			1
in the last two decades , @entity1 's energy needs have grown exponentially due to its rapid economic boom and urbanization			1
@entity1 last year overtook the @entity41 as the world 's largest consumer of energy			1
it depends on fossil fuel for 91 % of its needs			0
@entity1 has turned to alternative sources of energy -- wind , solar and nuclear power -- to improve air quality and curb global warming			1
" nuclear power is seen as cost - effective , low carbon , and more reliable than renewable energy such as solar and wind power , which can only provide power some of the time , " noted @entity62 , a @entity63 popular among intellectuals			1
in light of the human and environmental disaster looming in @entity6 , however , many @entity71 are asking : how safe are @entity1 's nuclear plants ? @entity6 's nuclear crisis has served as a wake - up call , said @entity27			1
" as in @entity80 and other countries , people here are saying , ' wait a second , let 's really think about it , ' " she said			0
experts say @entity1 is now reviewing the risks associated with earthquakes and tsunamis			0
it has had its share of major earthquakes , like the 7.9 - magnitude quake in 2008 , which killed over 80,000 in @entity92 , @entity93 province			0
its existing and planned nuclear plants are all located along its eastern and southern coastlines -- prompting questions of whether they are vulnerable to a tsunami			1
another concern is lack of transparency			0
although @entity1 has signed and ratified the @entity104 's @entity103 , critics say @entity1 is slow in providing public information on safety and waste - management			2
@entity110 , a senior @entity111 member and head of @entity1 's nuclear power program , was convicted last november in a $ 260 million corruption case in which he was accused of rigging bids connected to nuclear power plant construction			1
he was sentenced to life imprisonment , but his case raised concerns about lack of supervision			0
" do we have enough manpower to manage and monitor so many nuclear plants ? " @entity125 asked			2
" if accidents happen , do we have emergency response in place ? are we ready ? i am not so sure			0
" these questions are causing public concerns , @entity27 said			0
" already we have started to see the ' not in my backyard ' mentality , " she noted			0
" before the @entity6 disaster , most people do not necessarily understand the risks they are facing , but now people are actually more alert			1
" there is little public debate , except in cyberspace , where some netizens anonymously resort to sarcasm			0
some expressed surprise to find themselves living in close proximity to nuclear plants			2
other blogs listed locations of plants , with maps attached as well			0
one posting suggested that " @entity1 should put all government officials ' homes next to the plants			2
" experts say there are robust debates among @entity71 policy - makers , too			0
" some are quite convinced that the third generation technology in @entity1 's nuclear plants currently under construction is superior than @entity6 's , " said @entity159 , a political science professor at the @entity160			1
" others are more cautious , calling for more reviews and more safety measures			0
" still , @entity1 is not about to abandon its nuclear power ambitions			1
" the construction of nuclear plants will continue , but it will be a more cautious process , " he said			2
" call it lessons learned from @entity6			0
" advocates of clean energy hope those lessons will inspire @entity1 to switch to renewable energy sources			2
" hopefully we need not panic and kill nuclear energy altogether , " said @entity125			0
" in the long run , we hope wind , solar and other safer renewable sources of energy will grow really fast to replace high - risk energy sources like nuclear and large - sized hydropower projects			0
