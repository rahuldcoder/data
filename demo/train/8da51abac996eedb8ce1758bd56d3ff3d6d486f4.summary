" " the outcome is very clear			0
the court works for the police ; the tax bureau also works for the police ; the police is becoming a superpower in @entity7 ... and they decide everything because we have a policy : it 's called ' maintain stability ' ... but what is stability ? is it stability of the nation ? or of the people ? or stability of the controller ?
