at 7:35 a.m. in @entity2 , children who 've brushed their teeth , combed their hair and stuffed their wheeled backpacks rub their eyes awake and shuffle onto the street			1
they gather at the intersection of @entity8 and 35th street in @entity9 for the school bus			2
but this school bus does n't carry the kids			1
by its handles , the children hoist a yellow bus - shaped sign that reads , " @entity19			2
" the other students wave triangular orange flags to warn cars to slow down			2
they walk along the street and stop at another designated spot to pick up more kids at the " bus stop			1
" adult supervisors follow them for the half - mile walk to the elementary schools			1
all of them are exercising and they hardly know it			2
walking to school is the practice of a bygone era and it 's also a small piece of an extensive project to bring simple , healthy changes to a grand scale			1
three @entity2 cities , @entity9 , @entity42 and @entity43 , are undergoing a three - year health makeover under a program designed by @entity46 , an author and explorer			1
his mission is to " make the active option , the easy option			2
" @entity46 's program called @entity52 aims to make the healthy choice , the convenient choice by changing an entire community 's environment			1
he 's devising ways to change that environment by making it harder to find junk food , more convenient to get physical activity and easier to adopt healthy habits			1
the changes do n't ask for " marathon and diets , " @entity46 said			2
it 's small changes that add up , such as bike lanes , better pedestrian access , encouraging personal interactions and walking to school			2
@entity71 , a mom who coordinates the walking bus for @entity73 , said the walks have become more popular in just two weeks			0
when they walk to school , " people come out and wave like we 're a parade , " she said			1
" it 's nice to get cars off the street and the traffic , " she said			0
" it 's also nice meeting other parents			0
" the simple act of walking to school " engineers three to five miles a week , so you do n't have to worry about gym class and you get people moving , " said @entity46 whose project finds the best practices in healthy communities to apply to @entity96 cities			1
as @entity96 grow bigger and unhealthier , @entity46 , an author of books about longevity and happiness , does n't chalk it up to people being dumber or lazier			1
the blame for the obesity crisis can not fall squarely on the shoulders of personal responsibility -- there 's a bigger factor , he posits			1
it 's the environment , he said thursday at @entity109 , a conference discussing innovations in health			1
" we are all part of a system			0
we need to address the system			0
" " you ca n't rent a movie , fill up on gas without running through the gauntlet of junk food that can pound you all day long , " he said			0
" when you go to a @entity125 game , you ca n't go without seeing parents bring the pop and cookies			0
you ca n't get away from empty calories			0
" there is a degree of personal responsibility , but " discipline is a muscle that fatigues , " he said			1
the three neighboring @entity2 beach cities were chosen among 50 to undergo the health makeover under the project called @entity52			1
a major criterion was that the local government and schools had to be on board			1
the mayor of @entity9 hosts public hours in form of walking meetings with his constituents			0
a local food chain , @entity151 , offers calorie counts and nutritional facts including fat , carbohydrates and protein in its menu			0
the employees of the local @entity159 organized a walking group with 70 members			0
at @entity163 , a water sports brand , managers got rid of the candy and chips in the office and replaced them with sliced fruit			0
the businesses that have signed on to the @entity52 's effort receive free pedometers and free smoking cessation classes			1
@entity174 , an employee at a call center called @entity176 in @entity42 , said health issues at work also should be addressed			1
at the call center , workers sit in cubicles , staring into the computer screen and answering calls from stranded people using @entity186 highway call boxes			1
on a busy morning , there is hardly any movement , only the hum of conversations and typing			0
when @entity174 came to work at the call center six years ago , she gained 50 pounds			0
" when we get here , we gain weight			0
we were sitting down the whole eight hours			0
during breaks , we were sitting down			0
when we were n't sitting down at the call center , we were sitting down in the break room , " she said			0
the company decided to get involved with the @entity52			0
every week , the office gets free lunch -- but the only rule is that it has to be healthy			1
the workers usually prefer @entity208 sandwiches			1
the owner started filling a bowl in the break room with apples , pears and bananas			0
the employees also share an office bicycle for those who want to bike rather than drive to lunch			0
if small efforts like this means that workers " eat fewer calories , have less stress in the workplace , then all of this helps the overall emotional and physical well - being of the business , " said the owner , @entity218			1
it 's more expensive to lose workers to sick days than to provide healthy snacks , he said			1
since the efforts began , one employee has lost 20 pounds , and another has lost 12			0
about 75 employers , including aerospace company @entity234 , the public school systems and municipalities , have signed up for the beach cities ' efforts			1
the efforts that started in @entity2 this year are based on the same principles of the pilot project helmed by @entity46 in 2008 in @entity242 , @entity243 , a city of 18,000			1
in @entity242 , they banned junk food snacking in schools , started walking school buses , organized community - walking groups and identified the most socially influential people to spread healthy habits			1
the three - year project ended with an average weight loss of about three pounds , extended life expectancy of three years and a 40 % drop in health care costs for the city			1
@entity46 hopes to translate @entity242 's results to bigger cities			1
so they arrived to the three @entity2 cities			1
they found that the local governments and schools supported their efforts			2
plus the funding came from @entity52 , a well - being company and the @entity266 , a preventive health agency			2
a @entity269 poll of the three cities of 1,300 people found that 60 % of the population was overweight or obese			2
forty - six percent reported significant stress and their anger level was at 16 % , which was on par with @entity278 , @entity279 , according to the poll			0
" what has changed is the environment , " said @entity46 of the recent rise in obesity issues			1
" the price of calories , we 've engineered physical education out of our lives			0
we 're good people but we need to think of health in a different way			2
" in the early 2000s , @entity46 , on assignment for @entity293 , sought to find longevity hotspots			0
after spending five years , he wrote a book identifying five cities where people enjoyed longer and healthier lives			2
the five are @entity300 , @entity301 ; @entity302 , @entity303 ; @entity304 , @entity2 ; @entity305 , @entity306 ; and @entity307 , @entity308			1
he and his team distilled the reasons why these communities were successful			0
people there had social and community networks ( the in - person type , not @entity317 ) , had daily purposes in their lives			0
and they did not seek out exercise , because their daily routines were " landmined with opportunity " for physical activity , @entity46 said			0
to incorporate those lessons , the cities ' program includes walking moais -- essentially a social group that walks together based on common interests and schedules			2
there are 150 of them exercising through the three beach cities			1
@entity335 , 83 , and his wife , @entity336 of @entity42 , are the leaders of one of these walking groups			0
before joining the walking group , they never exercised			0
now they walk 12 miles a week			2
" walking alone at a health club is boring , " said @entity335			2
" it 's more fun to walk with a group			2
if we do n't feel like walking , we go anyway because the group expects us to be there			0
" it 's better than trying to do it on our own			0

three beach cities in @entity2 are attempting to change their health outcomes
schools encourage kids to walk , businesses encourage workers to adopt healthy habits
founder believes environment is bigger factor in obesity than individual responsibility
