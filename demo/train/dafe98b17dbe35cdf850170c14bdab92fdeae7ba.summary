a university student cowers in a pharmacy as a mob outside threatens her with sexual violence			1
a law student is groped by her classmates , the dean cites her " inappropriate attire			2
" frightening allegations but advocates say this is an everyday reality for women in @entity12			1
@entity13 is a college student			2
@entity14 is only using her first name to protect her identity			2
she readily recalls the day a group of men chased her down the street			2
" come on ! you know they want to , " they shouted at her , while making lewd gestures she said			2
finally she ducked into a pharmacy but found no refuge inside			1
'' no one in the pharmacy did anything to help me despite my pleas , they just wanted me to leave , '' @entity13 said			2
@entity13 says the men would n't leave but after two hours like this , she got tired of waiting			2
'' i was so afraid that one of them would touch me ... you just do n't forget something like that , '' she said			2
incredibly , @entity13 says this kind of thing happens to her daily			2
and she 's not alone			2
a 2013 @entity47 report entitled " @entity48 and the @entity49 " found that 99.3 % of @entity51 women have experienced some form of sexual harassment			1
the statistic shows how widespread the problem is , the stories get at the horror these women face			1
last month , a group of male students groped one of their female colleagues			0
crying , she shut herself in the bathroom			0
only when the men laid siege outside the bathroom did the university 's security move to accompany the girl safely off campus , according to witnesses			0
the university 's dean , @entity72 , blamed the woman for her '' inappropriate attire '' on a local talk show last month			0
he said that she was wearing a black cloak that she took off as she entered the university			0
a @entity81 video showed what she had on underneath : a long sleeved pink shirt , black pants and bleached blond hair			0
he later retracted his comments on his official twitter account , apologizing for the misunderstanding and denying the victim would be reprimanded			0
'' we will not relent in the punishment of these harassers , '' he added			0
@entity13 said it does n't matter what women wear			1
'' even veiled girls get harassed all the time , " she said			0
" it 's a lack of ethics and culture more than anything			1
'' but some say the women themselves need to be doing more to change the culture			1
colonel @entity105 , a female member of an @entity51 interior ministry task force set up to tackle violence against women , says the problem of harassment lies not with the state or the laws , but with women not taking action to report crimes			1
for example , she says , the law student did not file a complaint to the authorities			0
@entity120 runs the research and studies department at the @entity122 ( @entity122 )			1
she told @entity14 : '' the problem is very difficult because the women and girls themselves do n't take an action for these assaults			1
'' some women , including @entity131 , are speaking up			1
last year she says she was harassed in @entity12 by a 37 - year - old man			1
she says he catcalled her and made sexual gestures			1
@entity136 stood up to him and said , '' shame on your beard , '' referring to his beard , which is perceived as a sign of piety in @entity144			0
she says he then got angry , followed her and then slapped for having the audacity to talk back to him			0
she said he thought it was " his right ( to sexually harass me )			0
'' eventually other passers by intervened to stop her attacker , and she convinced them to take him to the nearest police station			0
'' the ( people ) tried to talk me out of taking him to the police station , '' @entity136 told @entity14			0
'' they said it 's just a waste of time , a waste of effort and he has learned the lesson			0
'' ultimately the attacker was arrested and charged with assault			0
but the prosecution released him before trial			0
he was tried in absentia , and found guilty			1
to this day he walks free			0
@entity164 is frustrated that despite the court order , her attacker remains at large , and the verdict has n't been implemented			0
'' they ( the authorities ) are telling women ' you 're on your own , ' and they 're saying to the harassers ' we 're not going to punish you , '' ' she said			1
colonel @entity176 insists that women are at the top of the interior ministry 's priorities			2
she argues that sexual harassers often leave the scene quickly , making it difficult to catch them			2
@entity176 's unit was established in 2013 to face the mounting incidents of sexual harassment and violence against women			1
it consists of four female police officers who have been trained in the @entity192 on how to '' face crimes of sexual harassment and implement them in @entity51 , " according to @entity176			1
'' to make things easier for the victim , we have three telephone lines and we work 24 hours a day			0
we have a fax and an e-mail , so there is constant contact with victims , '' she said , adding that they offered legal advice , as well as psychological and social support			0
@entity122 's @entity208 , however , said that despite the interior ministry 's efforts and cooperation , four female officers in a population of more than 86 million is n't enough			1
the @entity122 had been pushing the government to quickly pass a draft law they proposed in early june 2013 that would combat violence against women , include harsher sentences against sexual harassers and a specific definition for sexual harassment			1
but @entity176 explained to the organization that the term " sexual harassment " is not explicitly covered under @entity51 law			1
@entity227 spokesperson @entity226 told @entity14 the ministry 's human rights department is working to finalize a modified version of @entity122 's anti-sexual harassment law and have it approved by the country 's president			1
the draft law , intended to target sexual harassment , states that if one perpetrator is found responsible for actions that have sexual or pornographic overtones , or stalks , gestures or speaks in a way that violates a female in public or private , he could be detained for at least one year and / or fined up to us $ 2,800			1
if more than one perpetrator is involved , they would also be fined and could be detained for up to seven years			0
if the perpetrator is armed or is the victim 's boss or someone who has authority over the victim , the offender could be detained for up to seven years and fined up to us $ 2,800			0
@entity251 cited the current instability in the country and the absence of parliament , which is responsible for legislation , as reasons for the delay in implementing such a law -- although interim president @entity260 does have the power to issue laws unilaterally until a parliament is elected			0
yet @entity260 issued a law in november 2013 imposing more restrictions on protesters			0
@entity122 's @entity208 argued that a law protecting women should be just as important			1
@entity208 and @entity176 say they will continue to encourage @entity51 women to fight for their rights and speak out against the perpetrators			1
they also aim to encourage men to honor and respect women			2
in the meantime , @entity51 women like @entity13 will continue to struggle with sexual harassment from day to day			1
'' i do n't feel safe and there 's nowhere to go , '' she said .			0
