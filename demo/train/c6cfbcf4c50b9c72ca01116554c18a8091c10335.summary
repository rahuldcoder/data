@entity0 -- in @entity1 's @entity0 newsroom , right next to my desk , there 's a " douche jar			1
" inspired by the tv series " @entity8 , " the " douche jar " was placed in our cubicle cluster to prevent general douchebaggery or acts of egregious self - promotion			1
it works like this -- if you say or do something like a douchebag , you put a fistful of local currency into the jar			2
in case you 're not familiar with the term , the @entity23 offers up this definition			2
the douchebag " has an inflated sense of self - worth , compounded by a lack of social grace and self - awareness			2
he behaves inappropriately in public , yet is completely ignorant to how pathetic he appears to others			0
" in the newsroom , the jar is usually low on cash			0
most of its contributions are made in jest by a colleague out to channel a self - absorbed jerk			0
but on @entity45 , the " douche jar " is always full			1
there are tweets that claim to be breaking news , when they are not			0
there are tweets that overuse # hashtags			0
and tweets that are whiny and excessively personal			0
the general douchebaggery across @entity45 is so profound it 's prompted one user to launch " @entity56 " -- a @entity58 - like site that generates your douche score			1
for the uninitiated , @entity58 uses analytics to determine a user 's influence across social networks			1
is @entity45 slowing down ? on @entity66 , the ever - # winning @entity68 registers as " a bit of a douchebag " with a score of 50			1
for the record , i registered a score of 46 or " quite noisy " on the @entity76 scale			1
but instead of hanging my head in shame , i 'll blame the medium			0
@entity45 is , after all , is the one - to - many platform where you can sound off on anything			1
a bit of pride and pretense are bound to spill forth			0
well , maybe more than a bit			0
according to a recent study by researchers at @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 , only around one third of a @entity45 feed is actually valued by users			1
in a survey based on 43,000 responses to find out what people like and loathe about microblog posts , they found that followers described only 36 % of the rated tweets as " @entity103			2
" they thought 25 % were " @entity104 " and were neutral about the remainder			0
as for what works and does n't work on the microblog ? according to the study , " informative " leads the reasons for liking a tweet			0
" @entity112 " dominates the reasons for disliking -- scoring higher than " arrogant " and " mean " combined			0
so on @entity45 , it 's worse to be a bore than a douche			1
perhaps that can explain the popularity of faux @entity45 accounts that celebrate the self - love and pomposity of certain figures in popular culture			1
there 's " death star @entity126 , " the official mouthpiece for the @entity125			2
sample tweet : " @entity130 to @entity131 choke a few idiots			0
" and " the @entity132 " -- a @entity45 feed that satirizes a @entity135 official with gems like : " we 're confused			1
what part of intrusive policing , rabid anchormen , pandering websites and fenqing douchery is n't soft power genius ? " " not @entity151 " had been issuing regular missives to her " @entity144 " on how to achieve the actress 's mysterious aura and oneness with nature with tweeted tales like : " i once waded the entire length of the @entity153			2
i lost an arm to a hippo , but won it back in a game of @entity157			0
i am stronger for it			0
" sadly , the fake @entity45 account has been retired to keep the joke from getting stale			1
sometimes , we need a little douchebaggery in our lives to have a laugh at the self - centeredness of others and , thanks to downward comparison , feel better about ourselves			2
i went back to @entity171 to see how i stacked up against @entity172 on @entity45			1
i outscored him by a solid 32 points			0
and there 's another 20 bucks in the douche jar .			1

@entity1 's @entity178 says there 's no *shortage* of douchebaggery on @entity45
@entity171 calculates @entity45 users ' douche score to see how they rank
recent survey finds only one third of a @entity45 feed is actually valued by users
