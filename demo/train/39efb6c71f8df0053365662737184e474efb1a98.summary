we leave genetic traces of ourselves wherever we go -- in a strand of hair left on the subway or in saliva on the side of a glass at a cafe			0
so you may want to think twice the next time you spit out your gum or drop a cigarette butt in public			1
@entity15 artist @entity14 might pick it up , extract the dna and create a @entity19 face that could look like you			1
her project , " @entity21 , " fashions portrait sculptures from bits of genetic material collected in public places			1
" the idea for the project came from this fascination with a single hair , " @entity26 told @entity27			1
" this turned into a research project for me exploring exactly what i could discover about someone from an artifact they left behind			1
" as it turns out , she could discover a whole lot			1
her process starts with finding a sample in a public place -- a strand of hair , a cigarette butt or a chewed piece of gum -- anything that might contain cells from a person 's body			1
" you want something that is relatively fresh , " she said			0
" nothing that has been stepped on or that looks like it 's been sitting around for ages			1
" @entity26 takes the sample to a community biotechnology lab in @entity61 called @entity62			0
there she uses a standard dna extraction protocol to mine the dna , purify it and use it in polymerase chain reactions			1
the technical process is outlined on her blog			0
" from a cigarette butt , i can learn where someone 's ancestors likely came from , their gender , eye color , hair color , complexion , freckles , their tendency to be overweight and a handful of dimensions of the face as well with a certain likelihood , " she said			1
once she obtains the sequencing information , she takes the traits she 's gathered from the individual 's dna and feeds it into a computer program to generate a 3 - d model of a face			1
" the way that i use code is a lot like how a sketch artist would use a pencil , " she said			0
" i 'll take the code , and then i 'll generate different versions of a face			0
i 'll use the code to enhance certain facial features or decrease them based on what i find in the dna			1
" it takes about eight hours to print one of @entity26 's faces in @entity19 at @entity106 's @entity105			1
once it 's printed in what looks like a block of powder , the face is dug out , baked and hardened with a superglue - like substance			2
the faces are not exact replicas of the stranger who left the dna behind			1
@entity117 considers it more of a family resemblance			0
" it 's important to understand that these portraits are a general likeness			2
they 're not exact reconstructions , " she said			0
" they 'll have things in common with the person , but they wo n't look exactly like the person			0
" she is also unable to determine ages from the dna samples			2
so all of her faces look around 30			2
@entity26 started the " @entity21 " project with her own self - portrait about two years ago			1
" even though i was the one developing the code and training the system , i was n't really sure how much it would end up looking like me , " she said			0
" i was particularly impressed with how much the overall facial shape resembled me			0
" reaction to the project has been mostly positive , although some observers feel her work raises thorny ethical questions			2
" this is very creepy , " wrote a commenter on a @entity149 blog post			0
" we need to pursue our privacy post haste , if this is what is available to the public			0
" @entity26 said she understands that some people could be put off by the portraits or consider them an intrusion of privacy			0
but that 's also the point			2
she wants her work to raise questions about genetic surveillance and privacy issues			0
" if people find it to be a little creepy , that 's ok , " she said			2
" it 's meant to make you aware of these issues and make you aware that this is possible			2
" after all , " @entity21 " is an art project			1
and most conceptual art produces more questions than answers			0
" it 's meant to be an exploration at the intersection of art and technology and science , " she said			2
" and it 's meant to be a provocation			0

@entity14 extracts dna from material and turns that into @entity19 faces
her project , " @entity21 , " fashions the dna into portrait sculptures
" from a cigarette butt , i can learn where someone 's ancestors likely came from *...* " she says
