-- @entity2 's strong debate performance and his apology for his callous remarks deriding 47 % of the @entity6 public appear to be moving his poll numbers up in some states			1
but @entity2 's reinvigorated campaign is unlikely to move black voters			1
black support is at 0 % , according to a @entity14 / @entity13 poll ( @entity15 ) reported in late summer			1
the reasons for this may have powerful implications for the future of black political strength in presidential elections			0
it 's worth recognizing that the unwillingness of black voters to offer any measurable support for the @entity27 presidential candidate is unprecedented			1
it 's not enough to say that blacks are voting for president @entity30 because he 's black and that racial solidarity trumps politics			1
or to note that black voters are overwhelmingly affiliated with the @entity33			1
sen. @entity34 and vice presidential candidate @entity35 ran against a considerably more charismatic and untarnished @entity30 -- who was still black in 2008			1
@entity34 received 4 % of the black vote			2
black voters offered measurable levels of support to @entity39 , 8 % in 2000 and 11 % in 2004 ; @entity40 , 11 % ; and even @entity41 , 18 %			1
opinion : @entity2 's foreign policy twilight zone one of the reasons @entity6 voters do not support @entity2 is that they see the @entity27 's treatment of @entity30 , from the first weeks of his presidency , as an assault on a kind of racial collective dignity			1
this includes remarks such as @entity27 trash - talker @entity55 's description of the first black president of the @entity57 as " lazy " after his poor debate performance			1
it may seem like a long time ago to most @entity6 that @entity30 gave his first post-state of the @entity62 speech before a joint session of @entity64			2
but for many african - americans , it seems like yesterday that the shaky credibility of the @entity27 began its final downward slide			2
what we now know as the " you lie " moment , when @entity72 rep. @entity72 actually heckled the president of the @entity57 , will one day be remembered as a watershed moment in racial politics			2
only the immediate , fierce and united @entity27 condemnation of @entity72 could have possibly mitigated the effect of that moment on millions of @entity6			2
that kind of condemnation did not happen			0
interactive : racial voting bloc at its very core , racism has always been experienced as an attack on dignity			2
whether it was referring to a black man as " boy " or to black women by their first names , exiled to the back of the bus or to a separate water fountain , racism was a daily indignity for many early 20th - century blacks			0
segregation itself was an attack on dignity			0
the idea that the very presence of blacks would sully white schools , lunch counters or hotels struck at the dignity of blacks as human beings and fellow @entity6			2
the civil rights movement worked to bring about economic and political power , to be sure			0
but at the core of those rights was that people be treated with dignity and respect			0
so when the @entity119 - educated , eloquent , high - minded first black president of the @entity57 is heckled in front of his wife by a member of @entity64 during a nationally televised speech , it is a game - changing moment for millions of blacks			1
rather than an isolated event , the @entity72 affair was followed by other affronts , both big and small			0
@entity27 leadership 's priority of ensuring @entity30 's failure in office			1
the refusal of formerly moderate republicans to stand by positions they had advocated in the past in order to isolate the president			0
parental protests against @entity30 's desire to send a message about studying and working hard to schoolchildren before the first day of school in 2009			2
@entity144 refusing to give the @entity145 and @entity119 - educated president of the @entity57 an honorary degree			0
the rise of the tea party and the @entity27 ' cowardly refusal to call out racist elements in the movement			0
the video image of a tea party advocate apparently spitting on a black congressman			0
tea partiers and others who bring weapons to events marked by vitriolic @entity163 rhetoric			0
the entire " birther " movement and the ongoing attacks on @entity30 's legitimacy and nationality			0
the bumper sticker that reads " do n't @entity169			0
" opinion : @entity2 's sorta - kinda call to arms each of these affronts was directed at @entity30 -- but was experienced viscerally and personally by millions of black voters			1
the phenomenon is not easily reversible , at least not in the short term			0
it could even get worse : @entity179 strategists might ramp up racial appeals to increase white voter turnout , efforts such as @entity2 's " welfare president " tv campaign and the party 's crude efforts to suppress the black vote with voter @entity188 laws			1
in effect , having fully alienated black voters , the @entity27 may now see its only option as doubling down in an effort to increase the voting strength of white voters			1
it 's a cynical ploy , to be sure , but it explains @entity198 's recent assessment of the vote in @entity200			0
and it may explain why the chairman of the @entity27 insists on invoking the image of @entity30 as a stick - up kid who " stole " millions of dollars from @entity205 " to fund @entity206 " and whom @entity27 should " prosecute			1
" the ironic result is that the election of the first black president may well have moved us further back in removing race from politics than forward			0
what will this mean ? for the immediate future , we should expect @entity27 partisan politics to be fronted by an increasingly no - holds - barred use of racial appeals , particularly in places where @entity198 and like - minded strategists believe that working - class whites can still be manipulated by race			2
this will also mean stirring up hostility to policies that have been successfully racially identified in the minds of many working class white , male voters			1
these include welfare , criminal justice reform , support for cities and for public schools			0
until @entity235 , we wo n't know whether the @entity27 assault on the president 's dignity will translate into passionate black voter turnout for @entity30			1
but what is certain is that black voters have collectively cut ties with the " @entity27			1
" instead , for blacks , the 21st - century @entity27 may one day be remembered as the party of @entity72			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity246 .			0

@entity14 / @entity13 poll found black support at 0 % for @entity2
@entity246 : black voters see @entity27 treatment of @entity30 as an assault on racial dignity
@entity246 : *tipping* point was a @entity27 *lawmaker* heckling the president during a televised speech
the upshot could be a more *covertly* racial @entity27 campaign to gain white male voters , she says
