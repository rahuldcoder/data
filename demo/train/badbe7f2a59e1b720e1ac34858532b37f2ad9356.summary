pdf ) named @entity1 as one of the top three most innovative companies in the world			1
@entity15 , which took the second spot overall , ahead of @entity17 , was listed in the top three by 43 percent of respondents			0
but what is innovation ? how can it be quantified , and what does it mean that @entity1 comes out on top ? reticle research analyst @entity26 notes there are different kinds of innovation , and different companies excel in different areas			1
@entity1 and @entity33 end patent battle " @entity1 's innovation focuses on bringing together different parts of an ecosystem and tightly integrating them together with meticulous attention to detail " @entity26 told @entity0 via e-mail			1
" they refine consumer capabilities in an approachable offering with broad appeal			0
" @entity45 , number four on @entity5 's list , takes a different approach than @entity1 , making a point to incorporate the latest technologies into its products , like large oled displays and @entity53			2
" other companies , like @entity55 , focus on relatively unglamorous innovation in process and manufacturing , " @entity26 said			2
and then there are companies like @entity15 , whose innovation is largely left to prototypes and concepts , things like @entity66			2
" i think @entity1 is a leading innovator among tech companies â € ” but innovation comes from many companies , and it 's easy to point to clear examples from many of @entity1 's competitors , " @entity68 analyst @entity67 told @entity0			1
" a big distinction for @entity1 is the breadth of areas in which it innovates : hardware , industrial design , software , usability , retail			0
many of its competitors are strong in one or more of these areas but not across the board			0
" @entity88 review : more than just a smaller face interestingly , innovation ( at least in the surveyors ' eyes ) is not tied with r&d spending			0
@entity1 's absolute r&d expenditures rank it 16th within its industry			1
@entity97 , the top r&d spender in the software and internet area , was ranked as the sixth most innovative company			0
in recent months , @entity1 has come under criticism for its products being largely " evolutionary , " rather than " revolutionary " ( and even , in some respects , " utterly boring " )			1
because of @entity1 's history of innovation , many of us hold higher expectations for @entity1 than for its competitors			1
@entity67 thinks @entity1 will continue to be a leader in innovation in the coming years , despite doubts about the company now that @entity114 is out of the picture			2
" [ @entity114 ' ] leadership and imprimatur persist in the people that he hired , like @entity121 , " @entity67 said			0
