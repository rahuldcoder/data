" i believe you will not deny that one should hardly back those who kill their enemies and eat their organs			0

explosion , fire at @entity37 military airport the video referenced by @entity0 first surfaced online in may and generated outrage			0

@entity0 said those actions do not represent the " humanitarian and cultural values " of @entity51 or @entity1			1
opinion : why a man eats another man 's heart " if we speak calmly , in a businesslike fashion , let me draw your attention to the fact that @entity1 supplies arms to the legitimate government of @entity4 in full compliance with the norms of international law , " he said			1
" we are not breaching any rules and norms			0
let me emphasize that : we are not breaching any rules and norms , and we call on all our partners to act in the same fashion			0

@entity18 's administration announced the move last week after it said @entity4 crossed a " red line " with the use of chemical weapons , including sarin gas , against the opposition			2
@entity18 has not detailed the increased military support , but @entity98 officials told @entity99 that the plan includes providing small arms , ammunition and possibly anti-tank weapons to the rebels			0

it is the onslaught that he is inflicted on his own people which is the primary cause of the suffering , the humanitarian catastrophe and the deaths we have seen , " he said			0

@entity0 did not address @entity1 concerns that the @entity15 may attempt to enforce a no - fly zone over @entity4 , using @entity146 fighter jets and @entity148 missiles based in @entity149			1
on saturday , @entity1 foreign minister @entity150 warned the @entity15 against taking such action , saying it would be a violation of international law , according to @entity1 state broadcaster @entity155			1
@entity1 television reported that @entity150 's comments followed speculation in the media that a no - fly zone could be imposed through the deployment of the missile systems and fighter jets sent by the @entity15 to global military drills in @entity149			1
those reports followed news that the @entity15 had approved a @entity149 request to keep the fighter jets and missiles in the country after the conclusion of a joint military exercise			0
@entity175 spokeswoman @entity174 has dismissed media accounts that @entity18 has decided on establishing a no - fly zone			1

that 's not a problem you can solve from the air , " he said			0
@entity4 rebels have pleaded for anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons , saying they are outgunned by @entity42 's miltary			2
in recent weeks , the rebels have suffered a series of devastating setbacks , including the loss of the stronghold of @entity204 near the @entity4 - @entity206 border , that coincide with the arrival of @entity209 fighters who have been reinforcing government troops			2
in recent days , @entity42 's military and the @entity209 fighters , backed by @entity206 and @entity136 , have been battling rebels for control of @entity213 , @entity4 's largest city .			2

@entity0 *blames* both sides for the bloodshed in @entity4
@entity1 president says alleged acts by rebels do *n't* represent the values of @entity51 or @entity1
@entity1 's arms contracts with @entity4 are in **''** full compliance **''** with international law , he says
