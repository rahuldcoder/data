-- @entity1 broadcast on thursday an audiotape on which a voice identified as @entity4 declares " @entity5 is the perfect base to set up the jihad to liberate @entity8			1
" terrorist leader @entity4 spoke on a video released by @entity10 in september			1
the voice calls for the people of neighboring countries " to do their best in supporting their mujahedeen brothers in @entity5			1
" " my speech to you is about the siege of @entity20 and the way to liberate it , " he said			1
" the @entity20 siege is a direct result of @entity25 , " he adds , apparently referring to the site of november 's summit in @entity25 , @entity26 , where @entity28 and @entity29 leadership agreed to work toward a two - state solution			2
the voice also calls on " muslims in the neighboring countries " to support the " mujahedeen in @entity5			1
" the broadcast comes a day after another statement attributed to the @entity10 leader condemned @entity40 countries for siding with the @entity41 in @entity42 and for allowing the publication of cartoons considered insulting to @entity46 's prophet , @entity45			2
" this is the greater and more serious tragedy , and the reckoning for it will be more severe , " the speaker in the five - minute audio recording says			2
the speaker said @entity34 have not responded by mocking @entity52 , whom they consider a prophet as well			2
" the laws of men which clash with the legislation of @entity57 the @entity58 are null and void , are n't sacred and do n't matter to us , " he said			2
the speaker dismissed claims of free speech in his statement , citing @entity40 countries ' laws against denying the existence of the @entity67			2
@entity4 also said in his earlier message that " the crownless king in @entity70 " -- @entity72 's @entity71 -- could have prevented the publication of the cartoons " if it mattered to him			1
" " if there is no check on the freedom of your words , then let your hearts be open to the freedom of our actions , " he said			0
though the voice sounds like @entity4 , @entity0 has not been able to confirm that it is him			1
however , a radical @entity85 web site reported earlier wednesday that a statement from @entity4 was coming soon			1
the notice appeared on @entity88 , known for carrying statements and videos from @entity10 and its allies			0
analysis of previous statements has indicated that @entity4 was the speaker , and a @entity41 intelligence official said there was no reason to think the recorded voice was not @entity4 's			1
@entity4 , who was behind the terrorist network 's september 11 attacks , has been in hiding since the @entity41 assault on @entity42 that followed those strikes			1
his last public statement was an audio message issued in december , when he urged his followers in @entity5 to continue battling @entity41 troops there			1
wednesday marked the fifth anniversary of the @entity41 - led invasion of @entity5			1
the latest statement included no date reference beyond the cartoon controversy , which began in late 2005 when a @entity112 newspaper published a dozen cartoons about @entity46 , including one that depicted @entity45 wearing a turban resembling a bomb			0
violent protests erupted in early 2006 after other @entity40 newspapers reprinted the images as a matter of free speech			0
some @entity34 believe it is forbidden by the @entity124 to show an image of the prophet at all , and others were offended that the cartoon by artist @entity129 appeared to depict @entity45 as a terrorist			0
@entity129 said he wanted his cartoon to say that some people exploited the prophet to legitimize terror			0
several newspapers in @entity112 reprinted the controversial cartoons in february after @entity112 authorities arrested several people who were said to be plotting a " terror - related assassination " of the cartoonist			0
that sparked violent protests in three @entity42 cities this month , with @entity34 students burning flags and chanting anti-western statements			0
the message said the publication of the drawings in question " came in the framework of a new crusade in which the @entity149 of the @entity150 has played a large , lengthy role			0
" pope @entity155 is scheduled to visit the @entity41 next month , with scheduled stops at the @entity157 , the @entity158 and @entity159 , where the @entity160 stood until @entity10 's attack			0
deputy commissioner @entity162 of the @entity163 said the department " has been working closely with the @entity164 to provide the highest level of protection possible " during the @entity149 's visit to @entity168			0
e-mail to a friend @entity0 's @entity172 and @entity173 contributed to this report .			0
