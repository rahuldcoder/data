@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's form with @entity5 has been sensational again this season , scoring 34 league goals to help the club retain the @entity10 title , but the burning question is whether he can reproduce that on the biggest stage			1
@entity4 , the @entity14 , has been hailed as the natural successor to @entity17 legend @entity16 , who is now his national coach			1
he played in all 18 of @entity17 's @entity19 qualifiers but netted just four times as @entity17 struggled to reach @entity21 by snatching @entity23 's fourth and final automatic place in the last round			1
some critics have questioned whether @entity16 is capable of getting the best out of @entity4 , but the 23 - year - old told @entity2 's @entity28 that the two have a close relationship			1
" the truth is that @entity16 has always been very nice to me , even before he was our coach and i took my first steps as a professional , " @entity4 said			1
" now that i have him as a coach , he 's even more close and he gives me a lot more of his confidence than he did before			2
" is @entity4 better than @entity16 ? the comparisons with @entity16 have been inevitable , especially after @entity4 's stunning goal against @entity41 that evoked memories of his sometime mentor 's solo effort against @entity1 24 years ago			1
" he 's a legend in @entity17 , everyone from a young age knows who @entity16 is			1
at first , it was strange to have him as our coach			2
the truth is he was a little imposing			0
" but afterwards , we started getting used to him and he 's been our coach for a while , so now it 's normal			2
also , he 's really close to the players , he 's one of the guys , so there 's no problem			0
" he wears the no. 10 shirt made famous by @entity16 , who won the @entity19 for @entity17 as captain in 1986 with a series of dazzling displays in @entity61			1
" it 's very special for me to wear the shirt of the national team			0
i think it 's a beautiful responsibility to be playing with this shirt , especially with such a football - crazy country watching everything we do			0
it 's something very beautiful , " he said			0
@entity16 has had well - documented troubles with drugs and his party lifestyle , even being kicked out of the 1994 @entity19 , but @entity4 maintains a much lower profile off the pitch			1
" i 've always had my family really close by , and my friends , " he said			0
" the truth is that i 've never been one to go out much , to go out partying			0
i 've never had those problems because , yeah , my family has always helped me out with that			0
" the @entity84 - born forward said that he is hoping to make the @entity19 " mine " despite the weight of expectations on his shoulders			1
hopefully , it will be my @entity19 , @entity17 's @entity19 and that we hit the ground running and play up to peoples ' expectations and win the @entity19 , " @entity4 said			1
who will be the @entity19 's best player ? @entity4 acknowledges that @entity5 's free - flowing style under coach @entity96 gives him more chance to shine than with @entity17 , where he has a different role			1
" they are different systems and different styles and everything , no ? at @entity5 , @entity96 decided to use me more in midfield and that 's when i had more touches on the ball and played more around the front of the area			2
and well , i 've had the luck to be able to score more goals , " he said			0
" people have an opinion and i respect it			0
i 'm the first person who wants to do well with my national team and perform like i do with @entity5			2
i know that this is a really good opportunity for me and i 'm going to try to do it			0
" @entity4 insists he feels no extra pressure going into the @entity19 , with @entity17 's first @entity118 match against @entity119 on june 12 , as the intense media cauldron in @entity121 has prepared him well			1
" i already live with constant pressure to play well , to win titles and , as a result , i do n't worry about pressure , " he said			0
" i do believe that @entity17 is n't @entity4 alone			1
it 's a group where everyone is going to keep moving forward			0
" once i step onto the pitch , i try to concentrate and get myself into the game			0
sometimes , it 's hard , but i try to stay focused when i step onto the pitch			0
" who will win the @entity19 ? @entity17 are not among the favorites after struggling to impress under @entity16 , and @entity4 admits that @entity135 champions @entity121 , five - time @entity19 winners @entity136 and 1966 titleholders @entity1 are the teams to beat			1
" i think that right now , the strongest sides going into the @entity19 are @entity121 , @entity1 and @entity136			2
they had a strong , easy qualifying and are very tough , " he said			0
" but you have to show up in the @entity19 , and in the @entity19 anything can happen			2

@entity4 tells @entity2 he is determined to live up to high expectations in @entity21
the @entity5 star has yet to reproduce his stunning club form on *international* stage
he *reveals* that he has close relationship with his @entity17 coach @entity16
@entity4 wears the same no. 10 shirt as @entity16 and hopes to emulate his @entity19 success
