@entity0 painted an earlier version of his famed masterpiece " @entity3 , " claims a private @entity5 art foundation dedicated solely to the alternate painting , which it unveiled thursday			1
but an expert on @entity0 in @entity8 says there is evidence that the @entity12 master may not have been behind the picture presented as the " earlier @entity3 " but known more commonly as the " @entity14			1
" the @entity15 , based in @entity16 , offers a wealth of documentation to support its argument that the painting it represents is a predecessor -- from the master 's own hand -- to the world 's most famous portrait hanging in the @entity27 in @entity28			1
@entity29 , professor emeritus at @entity30 , who has examined the arguments , says the " reliable primary evidence provides no basis for thinking that there was ' an earlier ' portrait of @entity36			1
" @entity0 's lost masterpiece may be found in addition to a 320 - page art book titled " @entity3 : @entity0 's earlier version , " the foundation 's website makes its case using visual widgets of painstaking side - by - side comparisons of the " @entity45 " with " @entity3 , " magnifying their similarities down to the small details			1
the obvious resemblance , easily visible to the untrained eye , could be evidence that the work is just another copy of the portrait of @entity36 that was painted after @entity0 's masterpiece was completed -- and probably by someone else , @entity29 said in a news release			2
the " @entity3 " that millions of art lovers flock to gaze upon behind its protective case in the @entity28 museum was altered from a previous state			2
" the @entity45 picture follows the final state of the @entity27 painting , " @entity29 said			0
" it does not therefore precede the @entity27 painting			0
" the foundation and @entity29 also disagree on the results of modern technical examinations of the " @entity45 , " which the foundation has invested in			0
" the images produced by infrared reflectography and x-ray are not at all characteristic ( of ) what lies below @entity0 's autograph paintings , " @entity29 says			2
museum displays earliest known @entity3 copy the @entity15 presents historical notations by artists and intellectuals in the 16th century and beyond to back up the possible existence of a second portrait , but @entity29 finds it inconclusive			1
in a 20 - minute art history video , its own in - house expert @entity83 , main author of the book , presents the foundation 's detailed arguments			2
the video also includes sound bites from the director of an @entity92 museum dedicated to @entity0			0
" i believe it is more than possible that there existed two pieces of art , " said professor @entity93 , director of the @entity94 , pointing to features that could tie the painting to historical references to an earlier work of art. what the brain draws from : art and how we see it but @entity93 does not say directly that he believes the " @entity45 " is the predecessor of the world - renowned coyly grinning " @entity110			1
" in a speech in @entity112 on thursday , @entity93 again hedged his bets , not backing the foundation 's claim outright but saying it had presented a " fascinating possibility " that merited further study			0
" the ' @entity14 ' is an important work of art deserving respect and strong consideration as well as a scientific , historic and artistic debate among specialists rather than a purely media interest , " he said			0
he is conducting parallel research in conjunction with another expert , @entity127 of the @entity128 for @entity129 of the @entity130 in @entity131 , @entity93 said			0
meanwhile , @entity29 recommends " that questions are asked about the relationship of the foundation to the current owners			0
" the @entity5 nonprofit was established by bank chairman @entity137 , financier @entity138 and auctioneer @entity139 , who shares his last name and hometown of @entity143 with the foundation 's art historian			1
it does not divulge who owns the " @entity45 " on its website but explains that " the owners of the painting have endowed the @entity15 with exclusive rights to carry out its objectives			2
" if the " @entity45 " is not a @entity0 original , as the foundation claims , but a copy , which @entity29 thinks is more likely , then it 's not a great one , he says			1
it does n't quite have that @entity3 smile			0
scientists unlock secret of @entity3 's face			0
