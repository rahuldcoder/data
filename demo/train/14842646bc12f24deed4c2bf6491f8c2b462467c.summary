detailing the true story of how the author had spent two years emulating the lifestyle of the lowly cockroach in order to prepare himself for the upcoming @entity21 apocalypse			1
the disgruntled friend has just grandly exclaimed to her laughing pal something akin to , " it 's good that he 's studying up to be the last dude on @entity27 , because that 's the only way he 'll ever get a date , " when the young man across from the duo stands up , spills his coffee all over the table in a state of extreme agitation and cries , " i 'm sorry you hated my book so much ! and for your information , tons of girls are into entomology ! " in the @entity46 realm , such an instance could be seen as completely serendipitous , and the girl is n't really to be faulted for her less - than - favorable view of the book in question			1
but transpose this scenario into what is essentially the digital coffee shop of the @entity54 -- @entity55 -- and you have another situation altogether			1
more and more , @entity55 is becoming a kind of online comment box , a place for fans and customers to weigh in with their myriad opinions			1
which is good , in many instances			1
brands get constructive feedback ! musicians and fans make friends and collaborate ! an open dialogue is forged ! in other cases , however , we have scenarios like those above -- scenarios where words a fan thinks are falling on deaf ears result in an explosion and scads of useless fighting			1
read on for four ways you can drop a comment in the @entity55 box without making enemies			1
( @entity90 : if your aim is to instigate , that 's all well and good			2
still , do so at your own risk , because there 's a fine line between a taunt and a threat			2
be constructive your favorite band , @entity97 , has just posted their upcoming tour dates , and your hometown of @entity100 , @entity101 , is unfortunately not on the docket this go - around			2
rage and disappointment flood your eyes and a torrent of salty tears cascade onto your keyboard , effectively shorting out the " f " key			2
blasting @entity113 's number - one hit , " @entity114 : your @entity117 , " you take to @entity55 , sending off the following waterlogged words into the abyss , " uck you , emo screamo ! uck youuuuuuu ! " @entity113 's lead singer , @entity119 , happens to see your tweet and takes it to his black , black heart , shooting back at you in rage , " uck you , too , you illiterate toolbag			1
" at first , the joy at seeing the you - addressed tweet in your timeline blinds you to his rageful words , and then the slow realization that your favorite singer likely hates you fills you to the eartips with anguish			2
" i 'm sorry , man , " you type back rapidly , " i just really wanted to you to play in @entity100 , ya know ? i was just disappointed			2
" but it 's too late , friend , @entity136 has retreated into his dark cave of sadness , and has vowed to never set foot ( or " oot " ) in @entity100 as long as @entity142 is a band ( which will be about six more months , tops )			0
yeah , that was all a little dramatic , but the main takeaway is : be specific about your gripe , do n't just rage			0
if you 're sad that your favorite band is skipping your burg , tweet a special invite to play your church and crash on your couch ; if a journalist gets a fact wrong , tweet a correction , do n't call him / her an expletive , expletiving , expletive -- because you never know when the object of your ire will actually take note of your blistering display of inner turmoil			0
be careful how you at - reply tweeting directly at a person , brand , etc. is equivalent to running up to him / her / it on the street and yelling , " hey , @entity169 , @entity169 , listen to me			1
i have something to say to you and only you ! " when it comes to people , before you hit " @ " try to imagine yourself saying your piece to said person 's face			0
are you looking for a direct reaction from said person ? would you speak your tweet to his / her face ? if not , maybe just tweet something a little more general ( taking # 1 into consideration )			0
when tweeting at brands , think about your end game : are you trying to get faster service from @entity188 ? sure , send a ( see number one , constructive ) tweet to the company			1
expressing a blanket distaste for @entity193 ? maybe do n't personify the snacks by sending a tweet reading , " @ @entity199 , your new candy - corned flavored spawn was obviously crafted in the bowels of hell			0
" unless , you know , you want to be openly mocked on @entity201			0
special exception for the dude who elicted this tweet from @entity205			0
will your job take a hit ? this should be obvious , but if you work in a certain industry , you should probably be careful what you say about that industry in a public sphere such as @entity55			1
still , people are getting fired for doing just that , it seems , so we 'll just leave this here			0
does the medium fit the message ? tons of musicians got all up in arms the other week when singer @entity223 put out a call on her blog asking for volunteers to play horns and strings -- for free -- during select gigs on her current tour ( after raising more than a million dollars on @entity231 for her new album )			0
obviously there was a plethora of meeping on the microblogging site , but musician @entity236 scored the undivided attention of @entity223 herself -- in the form of a lengthy open letter -- after she posted a thoughtful epistle to her idol on her website			0
yeah , @entity223 and @entity243 may still agree to disagree , but at least the latter managed to open up a dialogue with her considered and articulate letter -- a dialogue that would have lost a lot of its cohesion and luster if confined by character limits .			0
