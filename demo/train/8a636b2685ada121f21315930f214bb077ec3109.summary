-- many trials in recent years have implicated our ongoing national struggles with race			0
but few have gotten as much attention as that of @entity8 , who shot and killed young @entity9 17 months ago in @entity10 , @entity11			1
perhaps the uncertainty of what really happened that night is part of what drew us : since only two people knew exactly what transpired and one of them is dead , we 're free to speculate and argue to our heart 's content			0
it may also be the fact that this young black man was n't killed by the police , but by an ordinary citizen			0
so anybody could put himself or herself in the place of @entity8 or @entity9			2
the verdict by itself says very little about race in @entity31			1
juries do n't ponder such things ; their job is to answer particular legal questions ( in this case : did @entity8 kill @entity9 in self defense ? ) -- which may not be the ones the rest of us are asking			2
and so @entity8 's acquittal was n't much of a surprise			1
opinion : when blacks killed by non-blacks , justice rarely served @entity9 could n't give his side of the story , leaving ample room for reasonable doubt			1
more importantly , under @entity11 law , it 's perfectly legal to follow someone for even the worst of reasons , confront them , and even start a fight with them			1
then when you lose the advantage to the point where you believe you 're in danger of " great bodily harm , " you can shoot the other person dead			0
the law forgives , whether forgiveness is deserved or not			0
@entity8 could have had the soul of @entity65 or @entity66 , and it would n't have made a difference to whether he was innocent or guilty under this law			1
social media erupts in anger , sadness over @entity8 verdict that 's " standing your ground , " the legal world that gun advocates have created and this case has highlighted			1
gun rights supporters have a @entity79 fantasy in which a brave homeowner uses his gun to fight off a vicious criminal gang intent on killing his family , but this case showed a far less romantic reality : a nebbishy neighborhood watch volunteer with a never - to - be fulfilled dream of becoming a cop chased down a kid who just wanted to get his @entity90 back to his dad 's house to watch a basketball game			1
the state laws governing who you 're allowed to shoot and when may not have been built with race in mind , but out in the real world , our perception of what 's threatening is still colored profoundly by race			1
@entity104 wondered the other day if , after an acquittal , people would " run out and cause trouble			2
" after all , you know how those people are			0
the head of the @entity112 police went to a black church to warn , " riots are not acceptable and riots are not expected			0
" well , if they are n't expected , why was the warning necessary ? there were warnings of riots from many corners , just as there were those who saw in this case an excuse to pick at race like a scab , for no reason other than sending their audiences to greater heights of resentment			0
@entity134 , for instance , read a story about the @entity136 sending mediators to @entity10 to help local officials defuse tensions , and saw a conspiracy from a @entity141 practically taken over by @entity142			2
opinion : doing what 's right not just about law " stoking the racial stuff is the way @entity149 was raised , " said @entity134 , the most prominent race - baiter in @entity31			1
" he 's got a chip on his shoulder about it , and he 's here to square the deal			0
and ( attorney general eric ) holder too			0
i think all of these guys have an anger about them			0
" even as we scorn repellent hate - mongers like @entity134 , it 's good to remind ourselves that we all make assumptions about other people , and we 'd all benefit from examining them			1
much of our reaction to cases like this one is built on what we assume other people are like , regardless of what we know about them as individuals			0
that 's what turns a kid walking down the street with candy in his pocket into a threat that should be met with a gun at the ready			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			2

@entity182 : @entity8 trial reflected much of @entity31 struggle with race ; verdict did not
he says reasonable doubt and @entity11 law made acquittal *unsurprising*
he says it may not have been law 's intent , but the threat it addresses is colored by race
@entity182 : @entity104 , @entity134 , others are race - baiting when they warn of *unrest* after verdict
