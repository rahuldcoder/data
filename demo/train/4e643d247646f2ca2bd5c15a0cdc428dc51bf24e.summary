@entity0 worth of art. some impressive sales were clocked wednesday , with a painting by @entity15 artist @entity14 selling for $ 1.35 million , according to a spokesperson for @entity19 dealer @entity17 , who sold the piece			1
but @entity8 -- one of the world 's foremost contemporary art fairs and a good barometer of the market -- is expanding its borders and developing another fair dedicated to art throughout history for next year 's edition			1
" the fact of it is that the art fair world is highly competitive and it 's actually overcrowded , " said @entity30 , art market editor - at - large for the @entity32			1
" the view from the outside is that the @entity8 organizers obviously feel that they need to occupy that ( older ) space , " she continued			2
@entity41 is the director of the new fair , which is called @entity43			0
she explained that it will feature presentations from a select group of around 70 dealers , and will showcase art from antiquity all the way through to the year 2000			1
" i think @entity0 has traditionally been the international center for historical arts and a big center of that market , which is why it makes sense for us to have ( @entity43 ) , " she said			0
but while the art fair world is highly competitive , @entity41 stressed that @entity43 will be different from more traditional fairs of arts and antiquities , such as @entity61 in @entity0 and @entity62 in @entity63 , the @entity64			1
" i think the key differentiator will be that @entity43 will be a very contemporary presentation of historical works , " she said , adding that architect @entity65 will be designing a clean , modern environment in which to house the fair and that contemporary artists will give talks about the influence of old masters on their own work			1
it is hoped that the new fair will open up fresh perspectives on both historical and contemporary arts while emphasizing the links between the two , said @entity41			0
it will also , according to @entity80 , introduce a new set of art collectors to the annual fair			0
" they 'll bring in galleries who are outside the contemporary art field , and those galleries invite their clients , " said @entity80			1
" the ( organizers ) are presumably hoping it might go the other way as well , that collectors of contemporary art might cross over to collecting more traditional art , " she said			2
and established , historical art is often a surer outlay for those looking to invest in art as a tangible asset , @entity80 explained , though she stressed that investors are different from collectors , who buy art in theory because they love it			2
" if you were taking about people buying art as an investment , there 's an overall feeling in the art market that an artist who has got an established track record , presence , has had museum shows , publications written about them , is a better investment because it 's safer , " she said			2
" on the other hand , you can also take a punt on a completely unknown contemporary artist and hope they 'll go up in value , " @entity80 said			0
" but that is far more risky , " she added			0
both collectors and dealers are behaving cautiously at this year 's fair , she said			2
" dealers are playing safe and not bringing anything challenging to this year 's @entity8 , " she opined , remarking on the lack of art dealing with issues including sex , politics and the economic situation			1
while there were some big sales on preview day , she said , there has n't yet been a buying frenzy			0
@entity143 is a director at @entity145 gallery , which has spaces in @entity0 , @entity147 and @entity19 , and represents young , emerging artists alongside the estates of more established ones			2
its president , @entity151 , is on the committee for @entity43			0
@entity143 said that despite the gloomy financial outlook , the gallery clocked impressive sales of works by some of its younger artists			0
" i found it a very serious crowd , i thought ( the buyers ) were committed , very focused on what they were looking for , i think the galleries that showed more interesting material that was posing an alternative to art fairs of the past did well , " he said			0
as for @entity43 , he is confident that it will add an exciting dimension to the nearly ten - year - old fair , which launched in 2003			0
" for us , it 's a very natural thing and ( collectors ) will find it an added benefit to come to @entity0 and have that new dimension in the way in which they look at work and re-evaluate the contemporary , " he said			1
@entity8 , @entity0 2011 takes place in @entity0 's @entity185 , 13 -- 16 october .			1
