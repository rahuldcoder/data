@entity0 , @entity1 -- for thousands of years , @entity1 has seen itself as the @entity3 , the center of the universe -- a view that shapes @entity1 's understanding of the world and contributes to an indifferent attitude toward other countries			1
the world may be watching the @entity12 election , but @entity1 is n't concerned with who wins			1
and many here believe @entity12 has lost the credibility it once had on the world stage			2
unlike the 1960s or ' 70s , when @entity12 had a more convincing claim as the moral arbiter of the world , many @entity1 officials now believe the @entity12 is only concerned with its own economic gain			1
map : @entity24 weighs in on @entity12 election in @entity1 there is little understanding of @entity12 society , or its politics			1
people stand on the sidelines of the @entity33 debate ; they do n't pick up on the nuances of the discussion , and they ca n't tell the difference between the parties ' positions			0
the mainstream @entity1 media are n't reporting on the @entity12 elections , nor are mainstream websites , which is exactly how the @entity1 government wants it			1
in fact , media coverage at all regarding the @entity12 rarely strays from local or regional events and their relations to @entity1 , like the current dispute between @entity49 and @entity0 over the @entity50			1
@entity1 intellectuals , and indeed the public at large , believe that no matter who wins the race , @entity12 will have to be soft in its approach to our country because there is so much at stake			1
postcard : how @entity62 see @entity12 election as for the candidates , people know @entity66 as a personality , but few could tell you what his government has accomplished in the last four years -- and @entity71 remains a complete unknown			1
for all the tough talk about @entity1 during the presidential debates , @entity71 and @entity66 evaded any mention of @entity1 's suspect human rights record , corruption , and rule of law			1
by not tackling these controversial topics , the candidates are protecting a strategic partnership with @entity1 at the expense of essential human values and beliefs			1
personally , i think @entity66 seems more reliable than his opponent , even though i 'm disappointed with his stance on @entity1 's human rights record			1
and although his administration has done very little to further rights here , i still wish him luck on @entity93			0
postcard : is @entity66 still @entity96 's favorite son ? while the @entity1 people desire democracy , they are skeptical of the @entity12 system because its elections do n't seem to engender progress for @entity12			1
democracy is a societal practice , and elections are only a part of it			2
the @entity12 elections are certainly an exercise in democracy , but wealthy individuals and corporations can now pour significant amounts of money and advertising into manipulating the public			1
the campaigns are mere showcases , extravagant yet empty -- and the time , money and energy spent on the grand spectacle could have been used to solve specific problems for @entity12			2
postcard : @entity125 enjoy election soap opera regardless , @entity12 should still be proud			2
it is essential for politicians and leaders to have open discussions about their policies , character , and beliefs			0
it is the key to public trust and understanding in an open society			0
i do n't think people like the way the debates and elections are designed , but at least they 're an outlet for people to make a stand			0
in contrast , all major decisions in @entity1 are made behind closed doors			2
here the public knows very little about who their politicians are , the decisions they have made and what they believe in			0
in a world that demands social change , this approach can not survive forever			0
recently i tweeted : " judging from recent events , @entity1 has not met the requirements that constitute a country			2
there is no consensus on recognized elders , no clear set of values , no independent state military , no full citizenship , no international respect , no transparency for leaders ' whereabouts , no clear borders , no equal access to defense attorneys , no proper administration of justice , no taxpayer rights ... as a country , @entity1 is missing all the qualities it needs to call itself a country			1
@entity1 is merely a faulty conjecture			0
" postcard : @entity66 finds support among @entity185 the one - party system in @entity1 is inhuman			1
it stands against the weight of civilization			2
it rejects the foundations of modern living , humanity and individualism			0
the @entity193 and the @entity194 show just how much effort @entity1 is willing to spend to enter the global stage			0
but while @entity1 desires to understand the world , it fails to accept its universal values			1
@entity1 and the @entity12 are two societies with very different attitudes towards opinion and criticism			2
in @entity1 , i am constantly under surveillance			0
even my slightest , most innocuous move can -- and often is -- censored by @entity1 authorities			0
recently i danced in a video spoof of the song " @entity209 , " and it was quickly banned across multiple @entity1 online video platforms			0
but the story still traveled all over the world , carried in hundreds of international media reports			0
postcard : drug war being ignored in @entity12 election ? that sort of censorship would n't happen in the @entity12 -- but even though @entity12 's government allows its critics to speak out , it is difficult to create any real impact in a country where a vast number of voices are at risk of being drowned out by others			2
in other words , regardless of your location , social background or political system , it is never easy to speak up against authorities -- it requires a lot of skill and persistence			0
it is impossible to compare @entity1 society with the @entity12 , as each system has its own dangers			1
but as the world 's two great superpowers , the upcoming @entity12 election and @entity1 leadership reshuffle demonstrate two different extremes in handling shifts in political power			1
postcard : why @entity251 , @entity12 are kindred spirits the people in both nations share a sense of hopelessness ; they feel empowered and disappointed at the same time but on different matters			0
no matter the country or system , it 's clear that the relationship between the masses and their leaders must be transformed			0
it wo n't be easy , and there will be constant challenges ahead , but it can be done			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity269 .			0

ai : @entity71 , @entity66 evaded mention of @entity1 's suspect human rights issues in campaign
while not perfect , @entity269 says @entity12 should be proud of its elections and democracy
ai : @entity1 's one - party system is inhuman , stands against weight of civilization
while @entity1 desires to understand the world , it fails to accept its universal values
