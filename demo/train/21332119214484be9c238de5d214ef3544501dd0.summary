@entity0 -- ready for @entity4 , the super pac urging @entity4 to run for president in 2016 , raised over $ 2 million and had 21,000 new donors in the last three months , officials from the group said wednesday			1
ready for @entity4 's haul came from more than 38,000 contributions , according to group spokesman @entity11 , giving the group an average contribution of $ 52			1
the $ 2 million is in line with what @entity8 has raised in the past , but slightly less than the record $ 2.5 million the group raised in the second quarter			1
@entity8 is part of a cadre of @entity20 outside groups that are organizing for @entity22 's likely run at the presidency			0
unlike other super pacs , which are focused on communications and large - money donors , ready for @entity4 has tried to focus on small , grass - roots donations			1
so far , the group has raised over $ 10 million			1
but in the third quarter of 2014 , @entity8 also moved to do more than just raise money and began to raise its profile in the eyes of many longtime @entity22 confidants by having a large presence at events like september 's @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity39			2
led by former @entity22 aides and supporters , the super pac also began to dish out money to state parties , local candidates and other @entity47 groups , as well as helping raise money for 2014 candidates whom @entity22 has endorsed			0
after @entity22 endorsed @entity52 in @entity39 , for example , the group blasted out an email to its supporters asking them to donate money to the @entity58 's @entity57 campaign			2
ready for @entity4 also maxed out contributions during the third quarter to @entity60 , @entity61 's @entity47 candidate for governor , @entity63 , the state 's @entity47 candidate for lieutenant governor and the @entity67			1
donating money to state parties has been a ready for @entity4 strategy for much of the year			2
last month , a source with the group said @entity8 had donated thousands of dollars to 29 state parties			0
most of these donations were close to $ 10,000 , the maximum the group can give to a state party			2
part of this stepped up involvement in early states is in reaction to the fact that other possible 2016 democrats are already making moves there , too			0
@entity89 gov. @entity88 moved political staff into @entity61 in august and has been raising money for state democrats for months			0
vice president @entity93 also has been heavily involved with helping local @entity61 politicos raise money since 2013			0
@entity8 began sending political staff to 14 states -- including @entity39 , @entity61 and @entity98 -- on october 1 .			0

number is in line with what the group has raised in the past
third quarter sees ready for @entity4 focus on more than just *fundraising*
so far , the group has raised over $ 10 million
