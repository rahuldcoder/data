we 've all been there			0
you 're in the middle of cooking a great meal or just sitting down to eat at a restaurant or in the last five minutes of a favorite tv show when your phone rings			0
you do n't recognize the number , but you answer it anyway			0
" it 's a robocall			0
more than 210,000 people complain to the @entity14 monthly about robocalls , those annoying and frustrating illegal automated messages			1
in the words of @entity20 contributor @entity18 , they are " like cockroaches : irritating , despised , always multiplying , seemingly indestructible and undefeatable			0
" that was before the @entity14 announced last october it was launching a nationwide contest to get the public 's help in solving a difficult problem			1
nearly 800 eligible submissions were received and two winners were announced on tuesday			1
@entity29 and @entity30 will each receive $ 25,000 for their " real breakthrough solutions " which focus on " intercepting and filtering out illegal prerecorded calls , " according to the @entity14			1
the prize money will come from last year 's agency funds			1
they will use technology to " blacklist " robocaller phone numbers and " whitelist " numbers associated with acceptable incoming calls			1
" we 're hoping these winning proposals find their way to the marketplace soon , and will provide relief to millions of @entity51 consumers harassed by these calls , " said @entity43 , acting director of the @entity14 's @entity44			1
the agency does n't endorse either winner , but encourages the private sector to reach out to @entity29 and @entity30 to develop their proposals			1
@entity30 's idea is called @entity58			0
it is a " cloud - based solution that would use ' simultaneous ringing , ' which allows incoming calls to be routed to a second telephone line			1
this second line would identify and hang up on illegal robocalls before they could ring through to the user , " explained @entity43			2
@entity29 's proposal , if nothing else , probably deserved an award for the longest name			0
his winning entry was titled , " @entity72 and @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76			0
" it would " analyze and block robocalls using software that could be implemented as a mobile app , an electronic device in a user 's home or a feature of a provider 's telephone service			2
" additionally , the @entity14 handed out a non-monetary prize to @entity88 for a robo challenge achievement award			1
the judges considered whether an idea would work , was easy to use and could be rolled out for production			0
more than 217 million @entity51 have joined the @entity93 since june 2003			0
but that has n't guaranteed calls will stop			2
many companies are using autodial technology that 's capable of sending out thousands of calls a minute			2
" many calls get through the system , " @entity43 said			2
" even if someone is not on the @entity103 , it 's still illegal to place calls without expressed written authorization			0
