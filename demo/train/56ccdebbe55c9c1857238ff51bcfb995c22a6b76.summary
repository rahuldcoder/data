there 's fresh evidence that @entity3 teenagers may be growing weary of @entity4			1
they do n't like the fact that their parents , grandparents and other adults are also there , diluting @entity4 's " cool " factor			0
they complain about their friends ' oversharing , and about too much " drama " on the site			0
and they 're increasingly flocking to other social platforms , such as @entity21			0
these are some of the findings of a new @entity25 survey of @entity3 teens ' social media use			1
released tuesday , the survey finds that teens are sharing more personal information on social media , but are also taking a variety of steps to manage their privacy online			2
but it was the @entity4 stuff that generated the most headlines			0
according to @entity25 , focus - group discussions with teens revealed " waning enthusiasm " for @entity4 for the reasons cited , including feeling " drained by the ' drama ' that they described as happening frequently " on the site			1
" the stress of needing to manage their reputation on @entity4 also contributes to the lack of enthusiasm , " the survey said			2
the @entity25 survey found that 24 % of online teens now use @entity21 , up from 16 % in 2011			1
other social platforms such as @entity53 , @entity54 ( which is owned by @entity4 ) , @entity55 and @entity56 also have seen big growth among young users in the past year			1
" those teens who used sites like @entity21 and @entity54 reported feeling like they could better express themselves on these platforms , where they felt freed from the social expectations and constraints of @entity4 , " the @entity25 survey said			1
" nevertheless , the site is still where a large amount of socializing takes place , and teens feel they need to stay on @entity4 in order to not miss out			2
" @entity4 has 1.1 billion users worldwide and remains the most popular social network among @entity3 teens			1
a @entity4 spokesperson declined to comment specifically wednesday on the @entity25 report but pointed to statements by cfo @entity76 in a recent conference call about quarterly earnings , in which he emphasized @entity4 's popularity among users under 25			1
" we continue to have really high penetration rates among that age group , both in the @entity3 and globally , and ... younger users remain among the most active and engaged users , " @entity76 said			1
" younger users are extremely active users of @entity54 as well			0
" @entity4 executives maintain that teen use of their social network has remained steady			1
they argue that @entity4 is not losing users to other platforms -- instead , they say , more users are visiting other social media sites in addition to @entity4			2
" the urban legend ( that @entity4 is losing younger users ) flows more often than not from surveys people have done of younger users that indicate that they 're using other social services ... much of the concern stems from the assumption that this is a zero - sum game , and that 's not how we see it , " @entity76 said			2
" we think the overall amount of time spent on services that enable you to connect and share is growing and will continue to grow			0
" @entity112 , a professor of communication at @entity114 and a frequent social media analyst , mostly agrees			0
" @entity4 's attraction to youth is based in part on being connected , but also on being an ' ingroup ' and ' cool ' thing			0
to the degree that the cool of @entity4 wears off , we should see some migration of teens to other platforms , " he said			0
" people are unlikely to fully leave @entity4 but simply to diversify their tools for accomplishing social interaction			0
instead of @entity4 being the @entity130 of social media , it will become just one platform in a big ecology , including photo sharing with @entity135 , broadcasting with @entity21 , etc. " @entity25 's findings are based on a nationally representative phone survey , run by its @entity138 , of 802 teens ages 12 - 17			1
it was conducted between july 26 and september 30 , 2012			0
@entity25 also conducted two online focus groups of teenagers ages 12 - 17 in june 2012			0
@entity25 found that the typical ( median ) teen @entity4 user has 300 friends , while the typical teen @entity21 user has 79 followers .			2
