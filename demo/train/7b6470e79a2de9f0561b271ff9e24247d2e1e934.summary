@entity0 -- new figures show that tough trading conditions across @entity4 are forcing many firms to making even tougher financial decisions -- particularly when it comes to their travel budgets			2
@entity9 , the managing director of the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) in @entity4 , says it 's not surprising that companies are slashing spending on business trips			1
" what we 're seeing are companies putting in place critical - only travel plans and that has a knock on effect , " he added			1
" it 's not about growth now for a lot of companies -- it 's about survival			2
unless something is considered critical to the running of the business , then it wo n't be authorized			1
" with travel expenditure often one of the biggest expenses within a business it becomes fundamental to reduce budgets			1
so where are the cuts being made ? hotels that were once perceived as cheap are now viewed as adequate and comfortable			0
the days of expensive flights are also long gone			0
" the standard now , is people travel in economy rather than business class , " said @entity9			1
" when trips are authorized , companies want more out of them			0
they want more bang for their buck			0
" latest figures from the @entity10 show varying levels of growth and decline across five critical markets in @entity4 in 2012 : @entity56 , @entity55 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59			1
together they make up nearly 70 % of business travel across the continent -- but @entity56 is the only nation where an increase has been reported			1
spending there will have grown by 1.6 % by the end of the year			2
elsewhere , the picture is n't as rosy			0
in the @entity55 spending has flat - lined , while in @entity57 it will have dropped by 2.2 %			1
the situation in the south of @entity4 is worse still , with spending on business travel in @entity59 and @entity58 dramatically decreasing			1
overall it means a reduction in spending of 2.2 % across @entity4 -- and paints an even bleaker picture than the projections issued by the @entity10 during the spring			1
" the spring 2012 outlook was formulated in may and since that time conditions in @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity80 , and @entity57 , among others , have worsened , " said @entity9			1
" the debt crisis may have been moved to the media 's and stock market 's back burner at the moment , but the crisis is still problematic and has caused economic conditions to worsen			0
" for some companies , it 's obvious that cutbacks are a necessary evil			0
but what kind of effect do they have on productivity ? " i take dozens of trips a year , and around 30 to 35 of those are international , " added @entity9			2
" if i had to travel in economy all the time it would take its toll on my well being			2
it 's about finding a balance			0
you do n't want your employees becoming less productive individuals			0
" @entity106 says he 's not surprised by downgrading of the figures by the @entity10			0
as the commercial director of @entity55 corporate services provider @entity110 he specializes in ensuring companies make the most of their travel arrangements			2
he says a growing number of firms are exercising caution around their travel budgets			0
" businesses are not out to stop traveling , " he said			0
" but there 's a lack of confidence and they 're putting controls on what they are spending			1
" they want to record the purpose of the trip			0
why are their employees going and who are they going to see ? is it external or internal ? are they going after a customer or extracting more business ? " people are being conservative and cautious because they are thinking about their whole business and they do n't know what 's ahead			1
" although the @entity10 's projections for 2012 are bleak , particularly for southern @entity145 countries , its outlook for next year makes for slightly more pleasant reading			1
the association predicts a 1.4 % bounce back in 2013 , which it links to job growth and any likely increase in gdp			1
is this a barometer for the region 's wider economy ? " there is coloration , " said @entity9			0
" there are suggestions that there 's a one quarter time lag between growth in business travel and growth in economies			1
" but with lingering debt challenges and continued austerity measures , the @entity145 economy is likely to continue to be challenged for years to come			2
the @entity10 's fall report therefore remains cautious			2
" but @entity106 is n't convinced the projections for growth next year will come to fruition			2
" how on earth would we know that ? we do n't have a crystal ball with that assurance , " he said			0
" in our experience , most companies are n't looking that far ahead			0
planning for the long term is now viewed as three to four months in advance			0

@entity145 businesses are putting " critical - only " travel plans in place
report : @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 have cut business travel spending in 2012
some fear employee productivity could suffer
growth projections for 2013 remain cautious
