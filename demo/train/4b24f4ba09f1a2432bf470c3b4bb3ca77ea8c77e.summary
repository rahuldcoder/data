-- the waves up to 30 feet high that climbed over houses thankfully are now a memory , as are related floodwaters that covered one quarter of one seaside @entity7 town			1
some streets that had been littered with trees and about 2 feet of snow are finally passable			0
and by late monday morning , temperatures should rise well above freezing , perhaps accompanied by rain			1
that 's the good news			0
but it 's still hard for scores of people still in shelters , and for many more huddling for heat overnight , to celebrate			2
" it looked like a war zone , " said @entity21 , a state representative for the @entity7 towns of @entity23 and @entity24 , where about 90 % of customers remained without power late sunday			1
" the devastation we have seen here would lead one to believe that it 'll be days before we get power back			2
" the blizzard that struck the @entity35 starting friday was historic by many measures -- most of all , by the amount of snow that fell			2
@entity40 , @entity41 , for instance received a whopping 40 inches , making it difficult for even plows to get out on the roads -- with @entity44 saying streets there had transformed into " white , wide , soft blanket ( s ) of snow			0
" tornado strikes in the @entity50 the tally in @entity40 was the most recorded by the @entity52 in any community , but even lesser amounts led to major headaches , especially when combined with , at times , hurricane - force wind gusts , powerful storm surges and snow drifts that buried cars and most everything else			1
" there 's a ton of snow , and there 's nowhere to put it , " said @entity61 of @entity62 , where 24.9 inches fell			1
" so it 's really frustrating to find nooks and crannies			0
" nine people were killed in accidents related to the storm , including five in @entity41 , two in @entity74 , @entity75 , one in @entity76 and one in @entity7			1
a 14 - year - old @entity62 boy who hopped in a snowed - in family car to get a break from shoveling ended up suffering carbon monoxide poisoning			1
about 270,000 utility customers remained in the dark late sunday afternoon , a significant improvement from the 635,000 without electricity about 24 hours earlier			0
these outages were the result of a combination of whipping winds and power poles and lines sagging , and sometimes snapped , under the weight of especially heavy , wet snow and ice			2
the storm by the numbers " there was a phenomenal amount of trees that went down , " @entity21 said , noting that 100 % of @entity24 residents had no power sunday morning and estimating it may be thursday before all the lights are back on			1
about 200 people were in shelters sunday in southeastern @entity41 , gov. @entity103 said			2
and more than that number found refuge at schools - turned - shelters on the @entity109 of @entity7 , where dozens of @entity110 were on the ground to help local authorities and residents deal with flooding and storm damage there			1
the forecast for the days ahead in the hardest - hit areas seems mostly a blessing , though there 's a chance of a curse			2
daytime temperatures should climb into the 40s monday in much of southern @entity41 , @entity123 and @entity7 , where rain may fall as well			1
that may help melt some snow , though it could make what 's there even heavier and increase the risk of roof collapses and more			0
@entity132 said sunday that there are reports of a barn , sports facility , commercial building and more caving in			0
the mix of snow and rain will also contribute to a messy monday morning commute into cities like @entity62 , though schools will remain closed there and many other locales as the snow clean - up effort continues			1
there have been notable signs of progress , at least			0
flights resumed at @entity62 's @entity153 on sunday , for instance , and @entity155 resumed limited service as part of its general ramp - up			1
" we 're working as hard as we can , " @entity123 gov. @entity159 said of efforts in his state , a sentiment echoed elsewhere			0
" we 're seeing efforts every hour			0
" snow woes were hardly confined to the @entity35			0
@entity165 is also brewing for northern @entity167 states , where a major winter storm will bring heavy snow and strong winds from northeast @entity171 to central @entity172 from sunday into monday , the @entity52 said			1
eastern @entity174 could see more than a foot of snow and 50 mph winds , " creating whiteout conditions , " the weather agency said			0
for all the headaches in @entity181 , meanwhile , there was also many enjoying the wintry conditions			0
@entity183 said students @entity184 in @entity62 , who were set to return to class monday , had enjoyed the weekend storm , engaging in massive snowball fights and building snowmen everywhere			1
people were even skiing down one street , he said , where students earlier took a series of photographs tracking the storm over 26 hours			2
the streets around the small school were still a mess , but they were no longer closed			0
" people have been going all over the roads with no problem , " he said			2
@entity203 , time line of the storm @entity0 's @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 contributed to this report .			0
