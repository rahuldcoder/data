@entity1 , @entity0 -- all agree that scores angry at @entity0 's military - backed government and the ouster of president @entity7 died in late - night clashes in the volatile nation 's capital			1
but they are of opposite minds as to who began firing first and who is to blame			0
dr. @entity15 , chairman of @entity0 's ambulance services , told @entity2 that 72 had been killed in @entity17 , an area of @entity1 the @entity18 has made its base after the group 's former leader was forced from power and ordered jailed			1
medics in a @entity18 field hospital there earlier saturday had put the death toll at 66 , with another 61 on life support and thousands more wounded			0
how did they end up in such straits ? ask the @entity18 -- the @entity29 group that was sidelined under longtime @entity0 leader @entity30 only to become the country 's dominant political force after his forced exit in 2011 -- and its members will say police fired live ammunition on protesters friday and saturday			1
a wounded protester getting medical treatment at a field hospital said he saw men in plainclothes fire on @entity44 demonstrators with shotguns			2
he referred to them as " thugs , " a term commonly used for young men who support the government and resort to violence			2
" police forces were standing behind them			2
also , military forces were outside blocking three entrances to @entity62 neighborhood , " the protester said , adding he had also seen corpses with gunshot wounds at the hospital			0
yet the prosecutor general 's office , according to a report early sunday on state - run @entity64 , concluded that protesters not only initiated the clashes but also fired live bullets on security forces			1
a police spokesman likewise rejected any allegations police opened fire , saying they only used tear gas canisters and were not responsible for the deaths			1
interior minister @entity79 offered a similar view during a televised news conference			0
the protesters were at fault for starting violence that wounded 14 police , none of whom fired back , he said			1
" i want to emphasize here that the @entity90 police force has never and will never fire its weapons at any @entity0 citizen , " @entity79 said			1
fresh clashes erupted early sunday in @entity96 south of @entity1 between residents there and @entity44 protesters , reported state tv , citing witnesses			1
meanwhile , an attorney has filed a lawsuit at a district court in @entity1 , asking that the military overthrow of @entity7 be overturned			1
@entity105 is basing his challenge on the country 's constitution , specifically sections that stipulate that a presidential term is four years and that the president is the commander in chief of the armed forces			0
a hearing is slated for october 8			0
large , rival rallies in @entity0 after judge orders deposed president jailed @entity7 may join @entity30 -- in prison @entity7 has not been seen publicly since the military forced him from office july 3			1
the military has not commented on his whereabouts , though a @entity18 spokesman told @entity2 he was initially under house arrest at the presidential @entity126 headquarters in @entity1 and later was moved to the @entity127			1
@entity128 -- a lawyer who met with @entity7 's former chief of staff , @entity130 , who also is being detained -- told @entity2 that the former president is being " treated with the utmost respect ... like a statesman			1
" yet @entity128 said that @entity7 and others who are being held " ca n't contact the outside world or lawyers			1
" the former @entity18 leader became @entity0 's first democratically president in june 2012 but found himself at odds with the opposition before the military removed him from power and detained him this month			2
state media reported he 's being held in relation to a jailbreak that took place during @entity0 's 2011 revolution but well before he came to power			2
prosecutors , who ordered a probe two weeks ago , said the escape of @entity7 and 18 other @entity18 members ( among others ) was plotted by " foreign elements " including @entity156 , its military wing , the @entity158 and @entity159			1
the @entity18 was named as a domestic group that cooperated with those who broke them out of prison			0
@entity7 -- who local media reports say was in prison for a single day without any formal charges against him -- is accused of escaping , destroying the prison 's official records and intentionally killing and abducting police officers and prisoners			1
now he could be headed back not just to prison , but the same one where @entity30 , the ousted dictator he and his allies have long railed against , is being held			0
@entity79 said saturday that such a move will probably happen , though an investigative judge will make the final decision on @entity7 's next destination			2
@entity178 opts not to define @entity0 ouster as a coup government awaits legal ok ' to end the protests ' neither side gave any hint of backing down -- not just on who 's to blame for the latest violence but on the bigger question of whether @entity7 should have been deposed and , more recently , ordered jailed over his alleged actions well before he rose to power			1
since @entity7 's ouster , supporters of the @entity18 and its political arm , the @entity192 , have staged mass rallies and sit - ins across the @entity197 nation			1
there have been rival rallies as well such as the ones friday called by military chief gen. @entity200 to show support for the army 's effort to end what he calls " terrorism " -- a statement condemned by the @entity18 as " inciting violence and hatred			0
" mutual trust appears absent as does the prospect of a peaceful resolution anytime soon			0
leaders of the @entity44 movement refuse to recognize the interim government or cooperate with it			2
the interior minister , meanwhile , had pledged that these rallies will be brought to an end soon			0
" we have complete coordination between the police and the armed forces to end the protests at the proper time , " @entity79 said			2
" ... but we are waiting for the prosecutor 's office to issue orders so can we have the legal cover for it			0
" opinion : why the @entity18 ca n't back down officials worldwide express concern @entity0 has been on edge since the military forced out @entity30 in early 2011			2
yet the situation has clearly gotten more dire in recent weeks			0
the @entity237 's foreign minister condemned the killings of @entity44 protesters in @entity17 as well as bellicose language by some @entity0 officials			1
" there is no room for hate - speech and other forms of incitement , " according to a statement released by @entity249 's office			0
@entity178 defense secretary @entity250 spoke saturday with @entity200 , his @entity0 counterpart , to encourage restraint , said @entity253 spokesman @entity252			0
and @entity178 secretary of state @entity254 talked saturday with @entity0 's interim vice president and its foreign minister to express @entity258 's deep concern about the bloodshed			0
" this is a pivotal moment for @entity0 , " @entity254 said in a statement			0
" over two years ago , the revolution began			0
its final verdict is not decided , but it will be forever impacted by what happens now			0
" @entity7 a victim of @entity0 's revolution of the mind @entity2 's @entity269 reported from @entity1 , and @entity270 and @entity271 reported from @entity272			1
@entity2 's @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 and @entity277 contributed to this report .			0
