" soon afterward , the army responded			0
" what was published in the @entity11 newspaper @entity10 is merely journalistic speculation and not a direct statement from @entity32 , " it said in a statement			0
if he does run , @entity6 will have to resign his military post			0
but with no clear contender , his chances of winning the presidency are high			1
he will become the sixth military leader to rule @entity3 since its independence			1
the only one who was democratically elected , @entity39 , was ousted by the military on july 3 after months of mass protests against his rule			0
