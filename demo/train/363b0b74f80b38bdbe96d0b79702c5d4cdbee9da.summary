-- president @entity1 has proposed expanding high - speed internet access in public schools across the country			1
that seems like an obviously good idea , to me and probably to you too			2
but of course , there is a rub : money			0
the initiative is expected to cost $ 4 to $ 6 billion			0
the federal government is hardly flush with cash these days			0
how then will it pay the price of doing something good ? the president is suggesting that the @entity20 raise the charges on cell phone users -- that is , basically , all of us ( there are today more cell phones than people in the @entity28 ) -- by $ 4 a year for the next three years			1
that is small change , to be sure , in a world of trillion dollar deficits			0
who among us would begrudge today 's youth better internet access for a penny or so a day ? and that may well be the " right " answer , from a moral and public policy perspective			2
but it is still worth pausing to make an important bigger point			0
we see here the same old deal with the devil that our government has been making for decades now			0
liberals like president @entity1 propose doing something good -- better internet access for all today , health insurance for all @entity28 some days back			1
but , heaven forbid , we can not ask wealthy @entity28 to pay disproportionately for the change			1
indeed , we can not even touch the income tax -- the one major @entity28 tax that at least pretends to be progressive -- to pay for any new social wants and needs at all			1
the fact is that the changes we made to the income tax in the @entity57 -- the " fiscal cliff " fix deal from the wee early days of 2013 that raised the marginal rate on married couples earning more than $ 450,000 a year ( yes , $ 450,000 a year ) back to its 2001 level of 39.6 % , and so on -- are supposed to be permanent			0
even if " permanent " means something like a wedding vow in my home state of @entity70 -- a year or two ? -- it is clearly too early to revisit that political hot potato			0
raising tax rates on the rich is a once - a - decade affair at best			0
raising taxes on the middle class has become more like our daily bread			1
all of the 2013 changes to the income and other taxes -- such as the gift and estate tax , which was " permanently " made largely irrelevant for 99.7 % of @entity28 -- brought in far less revenue to the government than the expiration of the " payroll tax holiday			1
" this latter change happened quietly , without need for any congressional action , as with the proposed mobile phone fee			2
as a bottom line , payroll taxes on all wage earners increased by 2 % of earnings up to approximately $ 110,000			0
the social security " contribution " -- not labeled a tax , mind you -- thereby went up by as much as $ 4000 for a married couple			0
we 're talking over $ 10 a day , now			0
this politically well hidden tax increase brought in almost twice as much revenue to @entity103 as all other 2013 changes combined			2
and so the fundamental things continue to apply as time goes by -- it is the middle class that pays , and the more hidden the " surcharges , " " user fees , " " contributions " and so on , the better			1
back to the episode du jour			0
@entity1 's proposed increase in mobile phone fees is especially well hidden , as a " charge " that the @entity20 alone can impose , without congressional action , on account of the " @entity118 tax " from 1996 , whereby then - vice president @entity118 helped give the @entity20 this power			1
@entity1 's proposal continues a trend of various forms of " excise " and user taxes -- on cigarettes , gasoline , alcohol , and telephone use , on both state and federal levels -- that is rising and accelerating			1
@entity1 was unable to deliver on his campaign pledge to raise income taxes in his first term , but he did raise federal cigarette taxes , for example , by 64 cents a pack in 2009 , to just over a dollar , and he recently proposed nearly doubling that level			1
meantime , there are already 17 % worth of various taxes and users fees on cell phones , which the new proposal would only increase			1
states and localities have been raising sales taxes for years now			0
no one who follows government or tax policy will be shocked if we one day , likely sooner rather than later , get a national sales or " value - added " tax ( @entity153 ) to ... well , to fund all the good that government does			2
now i happen to be a liberal who supports all this government good			0
but i am also a tax lawyer and professor who see the reality of the new class warfare in the @entity28 here 's that reality : the middle class is being gouged to pay for programs for all , including the poor			1
that may all be fine and good , until one day we realize that you can not keep getting blood from a stone , and the middle class becomes poor , too			1
then we will be left with only the rich to ask for a fair share -- unless , of course , the rich have gotten ahead of the curve , and are no longer hanging around in @entity28 for the asking			2
but they would n't do that , now , would they ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			2

president @entity1 's plan to fund @entity185 is to charge cell phone users
@entity188 : the middle class is being gouged to pay for programs for all
he says @entity1 's proposed increase in cell phone fees is hidden as a " charge "
@entity182 : why not ask wealthy @entity28 to pay disproportionately more for it ?
