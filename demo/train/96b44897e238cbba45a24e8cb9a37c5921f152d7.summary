-- seeking to blunt a sharp backlash to recent privacy policy changes , @entity1 has offered to share " the real story " about a system that compiles information about users based on their activity on all of @entity1 's sites and products			1
this week , @entity1 announced new privacy settings			1
they spell out the fact that the company collects and compiles data about its users based on their activity on its various sites -- from its search page to @entity19 to @entity20 to phones running its android operating system			2
the announcement gave some privacy advocates cause for alarm , even though @entity1 says the information is assembled to enhance user experience , such as better targeting ads that will be of interest to its customers			1
perhaps most notably , eight members of @entity35 , both @entity32 and @entity33 , wrote a letter to @entity1 ceo @entity37 asking for clarification about the changes			1
" while @entity1 suggests that the purpose of this shift in policy is to make the consumer experience simpler , we want to make sure it does not make protecting consumer privacy more complicated , " reads the letter			1
the lawmakers also noted that because of @entity1 's global reach , the change " potentially touches billions of people worldwide			2
" it asks @entity1 to share what kind of data it currently collects and explain how information collected under the newly announced system will be used			0
in a post on the company 's public policy blog , @entity1 's @entity56 wrote that there have been misconceptions about the changes			0
" a lot has been said about our new privacy policy , " she wrote			0
" some have praised us for making our privacy policy easier to understand			0
others have asked questions , including members of @entity35 , and that 's understandable too			1
" among the points that @entity56 makes in the post : _ users do n't have to be logged in to use many of @entity1 's products , including search and @entity20			1
no data is collected when a user is not logged in			0
_ when logged in , users can edit or turn off their search histories , switch @entity19 chat to " off the record , " use " incognito mode " on the @entity83 or employ other of @entity1 's privacy tools			1
_ quite simply , web users do n't have to use all of @entity1 's products			1
she noted that @entity1 wo n't be collecting any more data about users than it was before			2
" we 're making things simpler and we 're trying to be upfront about it			0
period , " she wrote			0
while noting that there are some advantages to having your information stored in one place , @entity94 wrote for tech site @entity100 that there are some scary aspects to it as well			0
" there are certainly reasons to be concerned about keeping all of your eggs in one basket			0
it means there 's a single point of failure , which makes me nervous , " @entity110 wrote			0
" the fact that you ca n't opt - out of shared search data , and that @entity1 will know more about you than your wife ? that 's a little creepy			2

@entity1 seeks to clarify its new privacy plan after backlash
changes will create a user *profile* based on what users do on all @entity1 products
members of @entity35 have asked for clarification
@entity1 notes there are privacy tools in place to opt out of some aspects
