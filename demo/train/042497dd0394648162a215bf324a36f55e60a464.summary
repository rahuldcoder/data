@entity0 , @entity1 -- the military judge overseeing the trial of admitted @entity0 gunman maj. @entity5 told defense attorneys thursday that they ca n't drop out of the case -- even though they believe it 's tantamount to helping him commit suicide			1
" this is nothing more than their disagreement with @entity5 's strategy in conducting his defense , " said the judge , col. @entity11 , rejecting a motion by the standby counsel who are tasked with assisting @entity5 as he represents himself			1
the attorneys argued wednesday that @entity5 is trying to help the prosecution achieve a death sentence			1
@entity11 's decision sparked a bitter fight in a trial focused on charges that @entity5 shot and killed 13 people and wounded 32 in the november 2009 rampage at the army installation near @entity30 , @entity1			1
" we believe your order is causing us to violate our professional ethics			0
it 's morally repugnant to us as defense counsel , " said lt. col. @entity35 , head of @entity5 's legal team			1
he asked for a stay on her order , which would prevent it from going into effect			0
the judge then asked for a written document from the state bar establishing that continuing to work with @entity5 would be an ethical violation			1
" i will make it easy for you			0
i 've given you an order ... and that relieves you of every ethical liability , " @entity11 said			0
@entity35 would have nothing of it , his voice raised in obvious frustration			0
" the order does not relieve us of the responsibility			0
... we believe we are doing something that is morally repugnant			0
this is not about saving my license ... this is about what you are requiring me to do today : assist this man in achieving the goal , which we believe is achieving a death sentence			1
" the lead prosecutor chimed in , questioning the defense team 's claims , saying that @entity5 is mounting a legitimate defense			1
" the government sees only two defenses : either ' i did n't do it , ' or ' i did it , with an excuse			0
' he was caught with a gun in his hand , " said col. @entity77			0
" i do n't understand how that 's repugnant to defense counsel -- i 'm truly perplexed			1
" in a military capital trial , a guilty plea is not an option			0
@entity5 's official plea is that he is not guilty of the charges			1
but on tuesday , @entity5 used his opening statement to declare " i am the shooter			1
" after the standby counsel argued wednesday that @entity5 was seeking the death penalty , @entity5 objected , calling it " a twist of the facts			1
" but he refused to submit his objection in writing , a move that @entity11 requested to avoid revealing privileged information in open court			0
the defense attorneys thursday immediately appealed @entity11 's ruling			1
but she gave no stay in the meantime			0
" we 're going to move forward , " the judge said , allowing the trial to continue unless a higher military court weighs in			2
the trial resumed with the prosecution calling to the stand soldiers who were witnesses of @entity5 's shooting spree			1
the attorneys ' request wednesday halted what would have been the second day of testimony			2
although @entity5 , a @entity116 - born citizen of @entity118 descent , was granted his request to represent himself , @entity11 ruled before the court - martial began that defense lawyers would act as standby counsel during the proceedings			1
expert : judge ca n't let attorneys stop @entity127 , a military justice expert at the @entity128 in @entity129 , said the defense lawyers are in " a terrible predicament			1
" " they have to stand by and watch the person they are ostensibly charged with assisting to represent himself essentially put a noose around his own neck , and they view this as fundamentally inconsistent with their ethical obligation as lawyers , " he said			0
but @entity127 said @entity5 not only has the right to defend himself , " he has the right to do it poorly " -- even to the point of asking for death			1
" the defense lawyers would love to get off this case , because it becomes unbearable , " @entity127 said			2
" if you imagine having to sit there , being an ardent opponent of capital punishment , watching this guy seal his own fate with every move he makes , it must be torture			0
but the judge ca n't let them off the case			2
" military death row : more than 50 years and no executions witnesses describe horror of shooting @entity5 , an @entity167 psychiatrist , was paralyzed by a police bullet during the rampage			1
he listened impassively as one of the first witnesses recounted the horror unleashed that november day at a processing center for soldiers heading to @entity175 and @entity176			0
staff sgt. @entity177 stared hard at @entity5 , appearing to brace for a cross-examination from the man who had admitted to shooting him seven times			1
but @entity5 just stared back			1
the courtroom turned silent as @entity177 was called as a witness			0
he was the first of several survivors scheduled to testify against @entity5			1
@entity177 recounted how the gunman rose from a chair in the processing center , shouted " @entity188 , " pulled out a pistol and began shooting			2
" it was a state of panic , " @entity177 said			0
@entity177 , a health care specialist , described how his friend and colleague , physician 's assistant @entity195 , tried to hit @entity5 with a chair to stop the shooting ; @entity5 shot him dead			1

after the prosecution finished questioning @entity177 , the judge asked @entity5 whether he had any questions for the witness			1
" i have no questions , " @entity5 said			2
@entity5 also declined to question @entity230 , who worked at the deployment center and was inside when the shooting began			2
prosecutors played a recording of her 911 call , where she pleaded for help			0
scheduled to go to @entity175 @entity5 had been scheduled to deploy to @entity175 before the killings			1
prosecutors hope to show that the devout @entity240 had undergone a " progressive radicalization , " giving presentations in defense of suicide bombings and about soldiers conflicted between military service and their religion when such conflicts result in crime			2
@entity5 did not want to deploy to fight against other @entity240 and believed " that he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible , " said col. @entity77 , the lead prosecutor in the case			1
investigators found 146 spent shell casings in the room where the attack began , @entity77 said			0
@entity5 carried two laser - sighted pistols and 420 rounds of ammunition , his pockets lined with paper towels to muffle the sounds of the magazines banging together , he said			2

@entity5 told the panel in his opening statement , " we mujahedeen are trying to establish the perfect religion			2
" but , he added , " i apologize for the mistakes i made in this endeavor			0

witness : ' his punishment will come ' @entity5 told his family he had been taunted after the @entity288 attacks of september 11 , 2001			2
investigations that followed the killings found he had been communicating via e-mail with @entity292 , the @entity293 - @entity116 radical cleric killed by a @entity116 drone attack in 2011			0
the case was first set to begin in march 2012 , but was delayed repeatedly , notably over a previous judge 's unsuccessful demand that the beard @entity5 has grown while in custody be forcibly shaved			1
