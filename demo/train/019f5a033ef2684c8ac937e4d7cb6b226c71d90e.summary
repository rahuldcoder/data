-- just as @entity2 are staring down flu season , @entity1 grabbed headlines this week with news confirming that a chicken was infected with the @entity8 virus and that many more suspected of harboring the dangerous disease were slaughtered			1
in the recent movie " contagion " , @entity13 's version of a pandemic , the government successfully executes a response plan			2
but our real - life encounter with a pandemic , the @entity23 flu , raises serious questions of whether the @entity2 public is prepared for such a crisis			1
it should have been good news that the @entity23 epidemic we confronted in 2009 - 10 was less deadly than feared , but instead , it was used as political leverage			1
conservatives , in particular , claimed the vaccination recommendations were overhyped , more " big government " meddling in citizens ' lives			1
what 's worse , many media outlets highlighted the critical narrative while minimizing strong evidence that the government handled the threat quite well under the difficult circumstances			2
this occurred as opinion polls revealed the public 's growing lack of confidence in government officials and institutions , which are now at record levels is it any wonder , then , that , despite extensive planning and billions of dollars , the public will be unprepared for the next time ? the reason lies in our deep distrust of government and thus , our unwillingness to believe the experts ' claim that vaccination is the single best method for preventing the spread of disease			1
to be sure , @entity2 have both historical and contemporary reasons for suspecting that government officials may not be diligent in protecting the public 's health over powerful interests			1
the history of epidemics is replete with boneheaded government actions that trampled the rights of marginal populations in the interests of protecting the so - called larger public			1
nearly every major @entity2 epidemic has targeted the poor or an ethnic minority group as objects of blame in efforts to prevent the spread of disease			1
as late as the 2003 @entity85 outbreak , @entity83 shunned the city 's @entity86 amid rumors that undocumented immigrants had brought the disease to @entity2			1
by some estimates , business fell by 70 % although not a single case from that neighborhood was ever diagnosed			0
in this media environment it is harder than ever for us to know who to trust and how to separate fact from fiction			0
during the @entity23 pandemic , radio personalities such as @entity101 and @entity102 implied that choosing not to take the vaccine was a litmus test of ideological commitment to opposing the @entity108 administration			0
some opponents of the administration 's proposed health care reform legislation delighted in the vaccine production delays and questioned its safety and effectiveness , saying it was proof of the government 's incompetence to " run health care			2
" two senators commanded a news cycle by demanding the secretary of health and human services explain the shortage , joining the chorus of those accusing the government of wildly overestimating the production schedule and making false promises within two weeks of such grandstanding , there was a surplus of vaccine , although well over half of those questioned in polls said they believed there was not enough vaccine for all who wanted it			2
too many are willing to accept , if not engage in , factual distortions to create their own comfortable reality			0
public opinion polls around the time of the @entity23 danger revealed nearly a 20 - point difference between @entity147 ' and @entity149 ' intention to seek the vaccine			2
republicans not only were less inclined to take it , they were also more inclined to doubt the disease was as serious as health officials claimed			1
our continued willingness to follow politicians who are leading us astray is to our own detriment			0
admittedly , it takes considerably more effort to critically evaluate the accuracy of information we receive , especially if inconvenient , than to simply accept what we want to hear , but we have no other choice			0
acting responsibly will literally be a matter of life and death			0
in the end , fewer than 20 % of @entity2 took the vaccine , with over half of the population indicating they did n't believe the government message that the vaccine was safe and effective			1
ironically , @entity13 has now legitimated the public 's skepticism by including a scene in " contagion " in which a reporter asks the fictional @entity180 official how he knows the epidemic threat is not " another false alarm " like the @entity23			0
take it from me : @entity23 was not a false alarm , nor were the government recommendations to address it hyperbolic			0
in the uncertainty of a crisis environment , government officials provided effective leadership			0
the distortions of politicians , ideologues and certain media outlets did us a disservice			0
fewer @entity2 than expected died or required hospitalization , but next time , we might not be so lucky			1
ultimately , it 's up to us to see through the politicizing and headline grabbing and protect ourselves			0
as @entity203 observed , " we have met the enemy and he is us			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			2
