-- fresh white smoke rose again monday from @entity4 's @entity3 nuclear power plant , caused by an explosion at a building tied to the facility 's no. 3 reactor			1
@entity4 's chief cabinet secretary @entity9 said that , according to the head of the nuclear facility , the container vessel surrounding the reactor is still intact			1
initial reports suggest that radiation levels rose following the explosion late monday morning , but @entity9 said he does not believe there has been a massive leak			1
" we are now collecting information on the concentration of radiation , " he said			2
a wall of the building collapsed due to the blast , according to @entity4 public broadcaster @entity25 , which showed plumes of smoke above the plant			1
the secretary said that water continues to be injected into the plant 's no. 3 reactor			1
that fact , and the pressure levels , has led authorities to believe that the reactor itself remains intact			2
the incident is the latest affecting the @entity3 , the hardest hit of several nuclear plants affected since friday 's 8.9 - magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami			1
officials said that the explosion was likely caused by a buildup of hydrogen gas , similar to what had happened saturday at the same nuclear plant 's no. 1 reactor			1
the 600 residents remaining within 20 kilometers ( 12 miles ) of the plant , despite an earlier evacuation order , have been ordered to stay indoors , according to @entity9			2
officials earlier said that they were operating on the presumption that there may be a partial meltdown in the no. 3 and no. 1 nuclear reactors at the @entity3 plant			1
authorities have not yet been able to confirm a meltdown , because it is too hot inside the affected reactors to check			1
the @entity63 , which runs the plant , said in a press release late sunday that radiation levels outside that plant remain high			2
@entity4 's @entity69 , citing the same company , said that there were measurements of 751 microsieverts and 650 microsieverts of radiation early monday			1
both are above the legal limit , albeit less than one reading recorded sunday			0
a microsievert is an internationally recognized unit measuring radiation dosage , with people typically exposed during an entire year to a total of about 1,000 microsieverts			0
on sunday , chief cabinet secretary @entity9 said accumulating hydrogen gas " may potentially cause an explosion " in the building housing the no. 3 reactor at the @entity3 plant			1
at another plant , in @entity90 , authorities early sunday noted high radiation levels			1
the @entity93 said later -- using information from officials in @entity4 -- levels returned to " normal " and found no emissions of radioactivity " from @entity90 's three reactors			1
" the current assumption of the @entity4 authorities is that the increased level may have been due to a release of radioactive material from the @entity3 nuclear power plant " located 135 kilometers ( about 85 miles ) north of @entity90 , the agency said			1
@entity4 's nuclear and industrial safety agency said late sunday the wind was moving north / northwest -- which could carry airborne radioactive material near the city of @entity112 and toward the @entity90 facility			1
most experts are n't expecting a reprise of the 1986 @entity117 meltdown , which killed 32 plant workers and firefighters in the @entity120 and at least 4,000 from cancers tied to radioactive material released by the plant			1
but in some ways -- especially the fact multiple reactors are affected , versus one in @entity117 -- @entity4 's crisis is unique			2
" this is unprecedented , " said @entity128 , the author of " in @entity129 : a @entity131			0
" " you 've never had a situation with multiple reactors at risk			0
" these issues come despite @entity4 's solid reputation in the nuclear power field			0
@entity4 is heavily dependent on the energy source , with 54 plants and eight slated for construction , said @entity142 of @entity143 , an environmental group			0
@entity145 's no. 1 reactor -- the oldest of the six units at the site , according to @entity149 , all of which are boiling - water reactors -- became operational in november 1970			1
" nuclear facilities in @entity4 ... were built to withstand earthquakes -- but not an 8.9 earthquake , " said @entity152 , a @entity0 contributor and research associate at @entity155 's security studies program			0
the crisis has stoked fears of a full - on nuclear meltdown , a catastrophic failure of the reactor core that has the potential for widespread release of radiation			2
high levels of hydrogen , as evidenced at @entity3 , is one sign that a meltdown may be occurring			2
so , too , is the detection noted of radioactive cesium outside that plant , according to @entity174 , an official with @entity4 's nuclear and industrial safety agency			1
this could be caused by the melting of fuel rods inside the reactor , indicating at least a partial meltdown			0
despite such evidence , @entity182 , a spokesman for prime minister @entity183 repeated @entity9 's assertion that the situation is " under control " and said he would not describe what was occurring in the reactors as a " meltdown			2
" but @entity128 , also editor of @entity191 for the atomic - energy community , said she 's not convinced authorities have a full handle on what she called " this hugely dangerous technology			2
" " the more they say they 're in control , the more i sense things may be out of control , " she said			0
the @entity3 plant has a containment vessel , which theoretically would capture radioactive material if a full meltdown occurs			1
in the meantime , government and power company officials are working to prevent even such a calamity -- even if it means rendering the @entity3 plant inoperable			1
authorities ordered the injection of sea water and boron into the affected reactors , even though salt and boron will corrode the reactor			1
" essentially , they are waving the white flag and saying , ' this plant is done , ' " @entity219 said			0
" this is a last - ditch mechanism to try to prevent overheating and to prevent a partial or full meltdown			0
" @entity9 has said there have been no leaks of radioactive material at any plants			0
radioactive steam has been released intentionally to lessen growing pressure in the two @entity145 reactors -- in an amount authorities have described as minimal			1
still , on sunday , @entity9 said nine people who were evacuated from near the @entity3 plant tested positive for high radiation on skin and clothing			1
this is in addition to at least three electric company workers who fell ill due to possible exposure , the @entity63 said in a statement			0
even if there 's is no further catastrophe , the nuclear situation -- part of what prime minister @entity183 called the " toughest and most difficult crisis for @entity4 " since the end of @entity254 -- has clearly made an impact			0
@entity128 said that it may take years to fully assess the damage at the worst - hit reactors , much less to get them working again			0
and authorities may never definitively determine how much radiation was emitted , or how many got sick because of it			2
then there 's the short - and long - term impact of @entity4 's electric grid : soon after the quake , power was knocked out to 10 % of @entity4 's households			0
most of those people now have electricity , though experts say it is highly unlikely the most affected reactors will ever be operational again			0
beyond that , the crisis may have a significant impact the nuclear power movement			0
@entity219 noted that while some countries , like @entity280 , may go forward in creating new reactors , others planned for @entity282 , @entity283 and elsewhere may pull back			0
but assessing the far - reaching implications of the crisis is n't the top priority now			0
instead , the focus is more on making sure that the situation does not deteriorate even further and put more lives at risk			0
if the effort to cool the nuclear fuel inside the reactor fails completely -- a scenario that experts who have spoken to @entity0 say is unlikely -- the resulting release of radiation could cause enormous damage to the plant and / or release radiation into the atmosphere or water			1
that could lead to widespread cancer and other health problems , experts say			0
authorities have downplayed such a scenario , insisting the situation appears under control and that radiation levels in the air are not dangerous			2
still , as what they described as " a precaution , " at least 180,000 people who live within 20 kilometers ( 12 miles ) of the plant have been ordered to leave			0
" the bottom line is that we just do n't know what 's going to happen in the next couple of days and , frankly , neither do the people who run the system , " added dr. @entity316 , a member of the board of @entity318			2
@entity0 's @entity325 and @entity326 contributed to this report .			0

new : a blast occurs monday at the @entity145 's plant no. 3 reactor building , an official says
new : the official says he does n't believe there 's been a massive radioactive leak
@entity93 says the radiation near the @entity90 plant " normal , " may be from @entity3
authorities have not confirmed meltdowns , because the reactors are so hot
