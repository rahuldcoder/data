@entity0 , @entity1 -- a lifelong nature lover , @entity3 studied biology in college and knew he wanted to work somehow with animals at sea			1
but he did n't find his calling until years later , when he was summoned to a beach and saw a gruesome scene that would change his life			2
" i found a turtle chopped in pieces in a bucket , and its heart was still pounding , " @entity3 said			1
" [ the police ] needed my help to decide what to do			0
" when you see how the people kill [ sea turtles ] and how they are just using them for their meat and eggs -- it 's sad			1
" there was nothing @entity3 could do to save the turtle that summer night 10 years ago			1
but ever since then , he has patrolled @entity0 's beaches as an unofficial keeper of the sea turtle maternity ward			1
@entity3 's conservation group , @entity31 , is dedicated to protecting turtles that nest along @entity1 's northwest @entity34 beaches			1
from june through december -- prime nesting season -- @entity3 and his unpaid volunteers watch over the shorelines where the turtles lay their eggs			1
" the turtles are not safe , " @entity3 said			1
" [ a pregnant turtle ] comes out in the dark , and a poacher can be hiding			0
" we are not the police , but we just want to take care of [ the turtle ] and be there when she comes out to lay eggs			2
" there are seven sea turtle species worldwide , and six of them return to @entity1 's shores each year to lay eggs			1
according to the @entity56 , all six species are " currently in danger of extinction			1
" for @entity3 , this reality is daunting			1
" the sea turtles have been here since the dinosaurs , " he said			1
" turtles are basically the link between the land and the ocean , and that movement is very important for many animals			2
some species keep the reefs healthy , and there are many animals that depend on [ sea ] turtles to survive			2
they continue the life cycle			0
" @entity77 : sea turtles struggle for comeback @entity3 's group , which is also known as @entity81 , is nonprofit and relies entirely on private donations			1
to earn a living , @entity3 works during the day as an ecotourism boat driver			2
at sunset , he heads out to what he calls the perfect job in the perfect place			0
" we go out to the beach and we wait for the turtles to come , " he said			0
" sometimes we may see one , sometimes there are 13			0
we might miss a turtle , and then we dig for the nest she left behind			0
we have to be there all night			0
" twenty years ago , the @entity1 government outlawed commercial fishing of sea turtles			1
it started fining people up to $ 16,000 for killing turtles or trafficking turtle eggs , turtle meat or products manufactured with turtle hides			1
but @entity1 still has one of the highest rates of turtle poaching in the world			2
" very few poachers are caught or arrested each year , " says marine biologist @entity113 , who has been tracking sea turtles ' behavioral patterns throughout @entity116 , @entity117 and the @entity118			1
" poaching remains a big problem in @entity1 partly because the people who buy sea turtles are often powerful , and partly because it 's not a high priority " for law enforcement			1
@entity3 believes the poaching business is sustained by cultural curiosity and tradition , not financial profit			2
a single turtle egg sells for about 50 cents			0
" i think it 's how the people feel eating something forbidden , " he said			0
" they want to try what is illegal , but [ they also ] believe the eggs are aphrodisiacs and they want to feel more strong			0
they have seen their parents and their grandparents eating them , and it 's a way of thinking that is very hard to change			0
" changing the locals ' perspective is part of what drives @entity3 to stay awake during his night patrols in @entity0			1
a good night , he says , is any night when a single turtle is spotted and protected from poachers			0
" we clear the path for her to dig the hole , [ we ] wipe her clean of dirt and sand , and after that the babies are left alone and she returns to the ocean			0
" the team digs for the eggs , collects them and re-plants them in a protected hatchery on the @entity164			0
the hotel has donated @entity3 hatchery space in exchange for offering their guests turtle conservation lessons and participation in a sunset turtle release ceremony			2
" as soon as the eggs hatch , we want the people to see them and learn , " @entity3 said			1
" to give them an opportunity to be part of releasing a baby turtle [ is ] something that they will never forget			0
" since 2004 , when he started his conservation group , @entity3 has facilitated the rescue and release of more than half a million baby turtles			1
the turtles ' determination to keep nesting despite natural and manmade threats inspires him to continue -- all night , every night			0
" they are endangered because of us , " @entity3 said			2
" @entity192 , they continue coming			0
if i 'm healthy , i 'll be here			0
i ca n't see myself doing anything else			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity195 website at www.vallartanature.org and see how to help .			2
