lately , @entity0 has been bringing an extra gun to his office in @entity3 , @entity4			1
@entity0 runs @entity5 on @entity6 close to where looting and vandalism briefly broke out in early august after a police officer shot to death teenager @entity11			1
" i bring an extra gun now only because it has a bigger magazine , " @entity0 says			1
he began carrying it after tensions increased in the area following the shooting			1
he says he would never use it to protect his business , but he would use it to save his life			1
" so maybe i get trapped here or something and have to have a @entity25 shootout , " @entity0 says before interrupting himself , smiling			1
" that 's the silly part about it : is that going to happen ? not a chance			1
but i guess , could it ? i 'm the only white person here			1
" @entity0 is particularly cautious now , as all of @entity3 and much of the nation waits to see whether a grand jury will indict officer @entity34 for the shooting			1
though the grand jury has until january to issue its ruling , the prosecutor 's office has said a decision could come in mid-november			1
@entity0 warns others considering getting a gun not to be reckless			1
when his adult son told him he wanted a gun to protect himself after the grand jury decision , @entity0 warned him not to rush into it			1
" people like him need to think about it , and not think about ' i 'm worried about this stuff , ' " @entity0 says			1
on monday , @entity51 , who owns @entity52 , told @entity53 that customers bought 100 guns this weekend			1
a typical weekend brings in about 30 buyers			1
" people are afraid they are gon na throw @entity62 cocktails , " says @entity51 , referring to the mostly nonviolent protests that have taken place in @entity3 since the shooting			2
the increase in gun sales reaches across racial and ethnic lines , he says			2
" a lot of black people are coming in saying they are afraid of the hooliganism , " he says			2
" but not all of @entity3 is hooliganish			2
the media portrays us that way			2
if the world can just see this is one little street in @entity3 going crazy , they 'd understand that we 're not just one big burning city			2
" at @entity78 in nearby @entity79 , @entity4 , manager @entity77 says gun sales are up 40 to 50 % as of last week			2
and lots of folks are coming in to the gun range for training , which he says is important for new gun owners			2
" every time that door opens , we 're seeing new faces , " @entity77 says			2
many new customers tell him they 're concerned about the response to the grand jury decision			1
the bulk of the weapons sold to new buyers are home defense shotguns			2
" we 've sold tons , " he says			2
@entity3 mayor @entity96 says a good number of residents have told him they 're buying guns for protection			2
the mayor has warned law enforcement to be mindful that there are a flurry of new gun owners			2
" it is a little frightening to think that somebody who is less trained may not have that restraint			2
" a gun owner himself , @entity96 says gun ownership is a responsibility that should not be taken lightly			1
@entity11 's parents push @entity114 for ' global intervention ' into @entity117 policing preparing for a hurricane just down the street from the @entity121 , hair salon owner @entity119 is praying for the best , but her brothers are helping her prepare for the worst			1
the shop she 's run for 11 years , taste of honey , on @entity125 , now looks like it 's ready for a hurricane , completely boarded up			1
she takes one look at her shop and shakes her head at the sight			1
" it 's hurtful , it 's really , really hurtful , " @entity132 says over the sound of hammers and drills behind her			2
" we do n't have the constant flow of customers that we normally have coming through here because everybody is afraid			2
" but some protesters say that fear is unfounded , that violence and crime among the protesters has been minimal			0
@entity150 , who can be found on any given night verbally lashing out at police , says it is unfair to call the protests violent			0
they are simply loud , he says			0
@entity150 claims to say whatever he wants to police and believes they should be trained to take it			0
" as far as what 's happened within the last 90 days , people would know if you had been paying attention			0
there has n't been any looting or violence or whatnot			0
we 've been keeping it peaceful and they are just worried about us using our freedom of speech such as we 've been doing			0
and we 've been pushing the limits on that if it 's even possible to do that			0
" in the early days in august , police were roundly criticized for their aggressive militarized response			1
now they tend to stand strong , but not react in the face of verbal abuse and on the few occasions where water bottles have been thrown at them			0
but police have faced threats			0
exhaustion and frustration among them is high			0
" it only takes one in 10 with bad intentions to make the entire situation spiral out of control , " says sgt. @entity187 with the @entity188			0
" a few protesters take it above and beyond not just aimed at police anymore but sometimes these threats are going against police officers ' families			0
" @entity34 , a 28 - year - old white police officer , shot and killed the 18 - year - old @entity11 , who was @entity199 , in a confrontation on august 9			0
since then there have been protests every single day outside the @entity121 calling for his arrest and indictment			0
in this normally quiet town of 21,200 , the majority of people -- those who support @entity34 and those who think he should be arrested -- do not believe he will be indicted			0
though the daily protests have been mostly peaceful since the shooting , few doubt that some level of violence will follow if there is no indictment			0
@entity216 , the prosecuting attorney for @entity217 , said monday that his office will announce when a decision has been reached by the grand jury and cautioned that until that decision is released , any claims made on social media " should be ignored			1
" @entity0 , the insurance company owner , hates to see the business that he 's run for 20 years look the way it does			1
" i hate the boards , " he says			0
but he obliged his landlord who offered to install them			0
" i do n't like them here , but i do n't want my windows smashed out either , " he says			0
@entity0 is one of the few white business owners in this part of @entity3			1
he says he knows most residents just want to speak their minds without violence , but he says it 's " the crazies " that worry him			0
" people who are n't afraid are stupid because fear keeps your mind alert and keeps yourself protected , " @entity0 says			0
and for him , so does the concealed weapon he carries			0
@entity3 mayor sees possible protests in region when grand jury decides fighting the fear on the surface , it looks like @entity251 is boarding up and cleaning out an old @entity253 restaurant on @entity254			1
instead , he 's renovating it			0
" we can change the face of @entity3 , and that 's what we 're doing here , " @entity251 says			0
he and a handful of volunteers , some of them also protesters , worked hand in hand with mayor @entity96 for a day to turn the old boarded up building into the @entity268			1
when it opens , @entity251 says the @entity268 will help local residents with job training and plug them into existing social services			0
" even though we have some bumps in the road , we stick together , " @entity251 says			0
steps away , at a strip mall with more boards than windows , the @entity278 and more restaurant stands out			1
not just for its signature @entity282 , topped with a fried egg , but also because it 's one of the few on @entity6 that is not boarded up			1
the owner , @entity287 , opened the restaurant the day before @entity11 was killed			1
" i want to make a statement to the community , " @entity287 says			0
" i 'm here , i 'm open and i 'm not going anywhere			1
" he suffered through the first round of protests and he plans to stand firm no matter what the future holds			0
" i refused to shut down then , i refuse to shut down now , " @entity287 says			0
" i fear only one thing : @entity298			0
