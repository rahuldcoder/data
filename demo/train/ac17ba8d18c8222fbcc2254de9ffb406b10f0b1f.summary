@entity0 -- two years after his death , music legend and celebrity icon @entity3 's legacy remains clouded by the debate over how he died and who , if anyone , is to blame			1
a @entity0 coroner ruled that a surgical anesthetic called @entity11 killed the then 50 - year - old @entity3 , in combination with several sedatives found in his blood , on june 25 , 2009			1
ever since , there have been ongoing efforts -- from awards to statues to new songs -- to keep his memory , and music , alive			0
still , much of the talk about one of the world 's most celebrated singers has occurred in courtrooms , centered around a host of cases related to his untimely death			0
authorities claim that his personal doctor , @entity32 , administered the fatal dose			1
he has been charged with involuntary manslaughter in the singer 's death			1
the doctor 's defense attorney , @entity40 , contends @entity3 was " a desperate man in many respects " and gave himself the fatal dose of surgical anesthesia while the doctor was not watching			1
one of @entity3 's sisters , @entity46 , told @entity1 's @entity47 this week that her brother " told me that they were going to murder him " -- identifying " they " only as " the people involved in his life , the people that were controlling him			1
" the late singer 's father , @entity57 , also fingered unidentified individuals in an interview with @entity1 on saturday			0
" we 're striving for justice , because there 's more to it than they 're claiming , " said @entity57 , who has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against @entity32 and also said he 's still fighting over who controls his son 's estate			1
" there is somebody else involved			0
" the singer 's mother , @entity72 , has filed a lawsuit accusing @entity75 of causing her son 's death by pushing him to rehearse for his comeback concerts despite poor health			1
in the suit , she described @entity3 in his last months as " confused , easily frightened , unable to remember , obsessive , and disoriented			1
" yet for all the legal entanglements , the last 24 months has also been marked by numerous attempts to celebrate , give new life to and capitalize on the singer 's historic career			1
according to @entity87 , @entity3 's estate brought in a whopping $ 275 million between october 2009 and 2010			1
the singer 's good fortune is due in large part to licensing deals cut by executors of his estate , a surge in sales of his music catalog and the $ 250 million box office of the @entity100 film , " @entity101			0
" that documentary , focused on the singer 's preparations for his world tour , came out within months of his death			0
@entity100 was under a contractual obligation with @entity3 's estate to not use anything that showed the icon in " a negative light " -- though @entity112 ruled that additional , raw footage could be used in @entity32 's upcoming trial			1
in a rare public appearance , two of @entity3 's three surviving children -- prince @entity3 and @entity118 -- appeared in january 2010 at the @entity119 to help accept a @entity120 on their father 's behalf			1
the singer 's music and dance also inspired a @entity127 show , " @entity3 : the @entity128			2
" and for months , there 's also been talk about a full - length album entitled " @entity3 , " featuring 10 songs and collaborations with rapper @entity134 and rocker @entity135 -- including a duet with @entity137 that was released online last november			2
but not all such @entity3 - related efforts have been directly tied to his music			2
@entity141 , for instance , helped erect a statue of @entity3 to stand outside the stadium of @entity145 football club @entity144 , which he owns			2
the @entity147 - born businessman , who had owned @entity149 department store and was a friend of the singer , told fans -- some bemused and others questioning the statue 's relevance -- they can " go to hell " if they object			0
also in @entity158 ( but not the @entity159 ) , the @entity157 planned to broadcast a special early this year featuring a re-enactment of @entity3 's autopsy			2
but the program , " @entity3 's autopsy : what really killed @entity3 , " was dropped before airing after repeated complaints			2
investor @entity166 said this spring that he will use cash from the sale of 130 unpublished photos he had taken of a then - 19 - year - old @entity57 to fund testing of a motor that he claims generates more electricity than it uses			0
and this weekend , the @entity3 's signature red and black jacket with " winged shoulders , " which he wore during the filming of the iconic " @entity178 " music video , was one of several pieces of music memorabilia up for sale at a @entity184 auction			2
in his interview saturday with @entity1 , @entity57 touted his plan to further develop his son 's dream and build amusement parks -- called " @entity190 " -- around the world			0
( in the same interview , he also publicized his new " @entity3 " cologne and vodka , called " @entity195			0
" ) " i 'm grieving over @entity3 , " the late singer 's father said			0
" it 's going to take me a long time to get over what happened to him			0
" @entity72 told @entity1 this past spring that she struggles each day without @entity3 , even as she cares for his children , whom she has legal custody over			0
" there 's not a day that passes i do n't think about my child , and he should be here right now , " his mother said .			0
