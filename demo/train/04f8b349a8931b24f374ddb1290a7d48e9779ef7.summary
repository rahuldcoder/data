@entity2 , as anyone who has lived or worked in the city knows , is simultaneously @entity3 , and not @entity3			1
the complex legal framework that was put in place when the city reverted to @entity3 rule in 1997 makes it a unique case , and one which means that the delineations between the @entity2 ( @entity11 ) and the mainland are rarely straightforward			1
the differences between the two provide a wealth of reasons why they are often at loggerheads -- and no more so than now , with tens of thousands of @entity19 taking to the streets to protest what they see as @entity24 's undue encroachment into @entity2 's civil affairs and political structure			1
certainly @entity2 's unique history has set it apart			1
while the former colony was returned to @entity3 sovereignty , the @entity29 colonial legacy has endured , and with it a set of institutions and historical , cultural , economic , legal and lifestyle differences			1
here are just a few of them examined			0
historical compared with @entity3 throughout much of the city 's modern history , @entity2 has been a bastion of peace , prosperity and , in the 1960s and 70s , a haven from the horrors of the @entity48			1
the city has welcomed refugees from across @entity3 , notably @entity51 , since the civil war and the rise of the @entity54 in 1949			2
indeed , @entity3 migrants to the port city provided the pool of skilled and unskilled labor that made @entity2 the manufacturing hub that it once was , setting it on the path to economic success			1
when a @entity29 landing party planted their flag at @entity64 on @entity65 over 170 years ago , they set in motion one of the most complex political relationships to endure to the present day			2
while the island of @entity2 was ceded in perpetuity following the first @entity70 , the bulk of @entity2 's landmass , the @entity73 peninsula and the @entity74 , were leased from @entity3			1
when the @entity74 ' lease was due to expire , in 1997 , it was decided that the former colony would be returned , in its entirety , to @entity3			2
since then the city has endured a " brain drain " in the 1980s and the early 90s , after @entity29 and @entity3 had agreed the handover of sovereignty , and particularly when the @entity85 crackdowns in 1989 were fresh in the memories of those @entity19 who could find their way out			1
there are some who fear that clampdowns on civil liberties might mean the city could soon face another exodus : " i 'm worried that people might migrate again , " @entity89 , a law professor at @entity90 , told @entity99 's @entity98			2
. " that would be a disaster			0
" the @entity102 : " one country , two systems " @entity2 's defacto constitution , the @entity102 , states that @entity2 will co-exist with @entity3 as " one country , two systems " for 50 years after the handover of power in 1997			1
due to expire in 2047 , it states that the city " shall safeguard the rights and freedoms of the residents			0
" one of the tenets contained in the @entity102 , and reaffirmed by @entity115 , @entity3 's then - top official on @entity2 , was the right to develop its own democracy			1
" how @entity2 develops its democracy in the future is completely within the sphere of the autonomy of @entity2 , " @entity115 was quoted as saying in the state media @entity118 in march 1993			2
" the central government will not interfere			0
" @entity24 , however , has repeatedly reinterpreted the document , and in june of this year released a @entity125 reaffirming its " complete jurisdiction " over @entity2			0
while the city enjoys many more legal freedoms than @entity3 -- including , crucially , the right to assembly -- this can be a brickbat for @entity134 voices			1
" the stability of @entity2 is crucial , " @entity135 , director of the @entity136 told @entity99 from @entity24			0
" there are better channels for people in @entity2 to express their positions , rather than resorting to illegal means of creating disturbances and counterproductive means of preventing other people ... to go along with their lives			0
" culture and lifestyle it is hard to foster a sense of togetherness after almost two centuries of being separate			0
linguistically -- cantonese is the common tongue here -- socially and culturally , @entity2 and the mainland can seem worlds apart			0
sometimes the differences are seemingly minor ; one prominent , telling example is of a video , shared on social media , of an altercation over a mainland tourist eating noodles on the @entity165 , @entity2 's pristine subway system			1
but even what appear to be surface differences can explode , and videos like this often go viral here , highlighting the differences between locals and their mainland cousins			0
much of the frustration is borne of the impact mainland visitors have in @entity2 -- crowding locals out of everywhere from maternity wards to high end boutiques , and pricing them out of the housing market			2
around the time of the @entity165 incident , a crowdsourced newspaper ad warned against an " invasion " of " locusts " -- mainlanders who would figuratively devour everything in their path			0
for those across the border in the mainland , the perception of @entity19 ranges from admiration to a feeling of contempt : following the media storm that followed the @entity165 noodle - eating incident , a prominent @entity3 academic , @entity196 professor @entity195 , called @entity19 " bastards " and imperialist " running dogs			0
" @entity2 identity every six months since the handover in 1997 , @entity90 has surveyed a sample of @entity2 residents to gauge feelings of identity in the city			2
the last poll was conducted in june , when over 40 % of those questioned said they identified as a " @entity19 , " rather than " @entity3 " ( amongst other options ) , a percentage that has crept up in the past 17 years			0
" the protesters are unhappy because @entity2 is becoming more and more like @entity3 , " @entity3 tourist , 24 - year old @entity213 , from @entity214 , told @entity99 at spillover protests in the @entity217 region of @entity73			1
" i support them because growing up , we always admired @entity2			0
if @entity2 became like @entity3 then that would be a real shame			2
" " in the mainland , first of all , we would never hear about something like this because of censorship			0
in the mainland , this protest would be forcibly dispersed within two hours , " she said			0
" here it 's different			0
i do n't think police will open fire because @entity2 is a safe place			0
" " i 'm not sure the protesters will get what they want , but i support them			0
" legal @entity2 is rightfully proud of the near - universal respect of the rule of law			2
for many , it is what sets @entity2 apart from the mainland and its reputation for honesty is one of the reasons that so many multinationals have based their regional headquarters in the city			2
the police generally have the trust of the population -- although how this trust will be affected by the events of the past few days remains to be seen			0
it was n't always thus ; until the creation of the @entity255 ( @entity255 ) , a nongovernmental watchdog in the 1960s , graft was as much of a problem here as it is in @entity3			0
@entity2 retains a legal system which closely mirrors the @entity29 one , another holdover from the colonial era , but one which prizes transparency and due process and is largely welcomed by the populace			1
the ruling @entity54 controls all aspects of @entity3 's judicial process			2
however , the @entity102 , guarantees the independence of the @entity11 's judiciary			0
economic @entity2 maintains its own currency ( which is pegged to the @entity271 dollar ) and the city 's " capitalist " system is also enshrined in the @entity102			1
@entity3 's oft - touted economic miracle is , at least in part , traceable to @entity2 's influence			1
not only was the presence of the city 's free market a huge influence on the economic reforms of the late 1970s and 80s , but investment in the mainland from @entity2 tops that from everywhere else combined			1
the rest of @entity3 has benefited greatly from @entity2 's " investment , energy and entrepreneurship , " @entity90 's @entity89 , says			1
however , as @entity3 's economic clout grows , so does @entity2 's dependence on it			1
as a logistics center and the world 's " gateway to @entity3 " the city relies heavily on re-export of @entity3 manufacturing , and inwards tourism and retail demand from the mainland is a significant earner for @entity2			1
the mainland 's promotion of its own cities as rivals to @entity2 -- @entity51 as a free trade and financial hub , for example -- could further complicate the relationship between @entity2 and @entity3 .			1

@entity2 's " one country , two systems " governance guarantees the city a high *degree* of autonomy
the relationship between @entity2 and @entity3 is often complex
@entity29 colonial legacy and institutions , as well as historical , cultural , economic , legal and lifestyle differences , remain
