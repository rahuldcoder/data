@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 , eyesores , nightmares of architecture -- call them what you like , ugly buildings are sadly all around us			2
worst in @entity12 : the @entity13 in @entity14 was voted as the country 's ugliest building			1
and you can not simply define one category of hideous architecture			2
there is ugly , and then there is @entity22			0
the latter often open in controversial circumstances : there may be protests from local residents , and there can even be calls to knock them down			0
yes , these are the world 's ugliest buildings			1
from the divisive @entity33 ( @entity34 ) in @entity1 , to the @entity35 in @entity36 , and the incomplete @entity37 in @entity38 -- we have compiled a gallery of ten of the world 's ugliest buildings for your viewing displeasure			1
although the buildings shown are scattered across the globe , they share several things in common			0
all of them had big budgets , most were attempts at creating contemporary or futuristic styling , and they have all divided opinion among local residents , architects , and the general public			0
click here to see photos of the world 's ugliest buildings Â» and these largely unpleasant buildings should not be treated as a joke			1
sometimes the architecture can have a grave impact on the perception of a city or region			0
@entity14 , in the @entity67 of the @entity12 , for example , was recently voted the ugliest city in the country through a national poll			1
this came after the city 's @entity13 and the @entity73 were named as the number one and two ugliest buildings in the country			1
and far from it being a case of the rest of the country bashing the area , in a local poll some 40 percent of local residents agreed that their city was home to the single ugliest building in the country			2
