@entity0 -- did you think the @entity3 had cornered the market on racism , nativism and ethnic demagoguery ? if so , think again			1
that is the @entity3 's modus operandi when it comes to the immigration issue			1
in an ugly trend that started in the @entity12 in the 1990s but has now moved on to the @entity13 and @entity14 , @entity3 have learned to scare up votes by exploiting fear of changing demographics and the anxiety that many @entity19 have about an " invasion " of illegal immigrants across the @entity19 - @entity23 border			2
but this fear of foreigners has proven just effective enough that @entity26 are now borrowing the @entity3 's playbook to advance their own causes			1
here 's the difference : the voters who fear - mongering @entity26 want to manipulate are n't so much afraid of what worries many conservatives -- that immigrants are supposedly lowering our standard of living , changing the country 's complexion and weakening our sense of national identity			1
they 're more afraid that foreign workers -- either here in the @entity19 or even in their home countries -- are going to take their jobs , lower wages , or prove so attractive to companies and factories that jobs go overseas			0
in other words , the fears are n't cultural ; they 're economic			0
but the way that @entity26 exploit those fears is still the same : racism , nativism and ethnic demagoguery			1
which takes us to @entity56 , where a super pac allied with @entity26 recently took the low road in attacking its no. 1 @entity3 target : senate minority leader @entity60			1
in a juvenile and insulting display , @entity61 recently resorted to @entity64 fear mongering to stir public resentment against @entity66			1
the goal might be to soften up the @entity3 a bit before his 2014 re-election campaign , where he could find himself running against @entity72 actress @entity71			2
politics is about finding your opponent 's soft spot and then pounding away at it like @entity78			0
@entity61 thinks that @entity66 's soft spot is that he has -- gasp ! -- an @entity83 - @entity19 wife , who happens to be former labor secretary @entity84			1
the group has been pounding away at this absurd idea that @entity66 's wife 's ethnic heritage ( @entity89 was born in @entity90 and came to the @entity19 with her family when she was 8 years old ) has led him to support outsourcing jobs to -- wait for it , wait for it -- @entity96			1
in a february 14 tweet that was " re-tweeted " several times , @entity61 said this about @entity89 : " this woman has the ear of @ mcconnellpress -- she 's his # wife			2
may explain why your job moved to # @entity96 ! " not really			0
you want an explanation for why your job went to @entity96 -- or for that matter , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 or some other country ? fine			0
how about the fact that powerful unions have driven up wages and benefits and pension plans to the point where they 've placed many @entity19 workers out of the market and made foreign labor more attractive in comparison ? tweet that , pal			0
other @entity64 tweets from @entity61 included : " @ mcconnellpress @entity60 and his $ $ $ have very strong ties to # @entity96 ( that place your job moved to ) " " i think you 'd have to go to @entity128 & @entity96 to find the people # @entity130 represents ! @ mcconnellpress " " is # @entity130 too close to @entity96 ? @entity131 ' very surprised ' at @entity89 pick po.st / v4qoi7 via @ worldnetdaily.com " " @entity132 grateful to @entity66 father - in - law / @ kygop contributor - 4 his role in developing @entity96 industry ow.ly / @entity136 # kyga13 " characterizing the @entity138 messages as " racial slurs " and " the ultimate outrage , " @entity66 quickly came to his wife 's defense -- and his own			1
" they will not get away with attacking my wife in this campaign , " he said			0
" @entity84 is just as much an @entity19 as any of the rest of them			2
in fact , she had to go through a lot more to become an @entity19			0
" earlier , @entity151 , campaign manager of @entity66 's re-election campaign , accused @entity61 of " race - baiting " and said the people responsible ought to be fired and should " really be ashamed			1
oh yes , they absolutely should be ashamed			0
when @entity26 do things like this , they lose the moral ground to criticize @entity3 the next time			1
they also tell the rest of us that maybe that outrage they claimed to feel when criticizing @entity3 for similar tactics was n't all that authentic			2
you know who did come off as authentic and admirable in all this ? @entity71			0
as someone who seems more and more interested in challenging @entity66 in 2014 , she wasted no time in condemning the attack			2
@entity71 tweeted : " whatever the intention , whatever the venue , whomever the person , attacks or comments on anyone 's ethnicity are wrong & patently unacceptable			2
good for her for saying so			0
but the intention of @entity61 is quite clear -- to paint @entity89 as un-american and her husband to be under her influence			0
after initially trying to downplay the whole affair and denying any intent at " race - baiting , " @entity61 eventually had to swallow its medicine and apologize			0
but , juvenile to the end , the group did n't apologize to @entity66 , who was after all the subject of the attack			1
in a statement posted online , executive director @entity192 apologized only to @entity89 for what he called an " unnecessary comment			0
" speaking of medicine , let 's hope now that @entity3 have had a strong dose of their own , and having been subjected to this line of attack , they 've learned a lesson and will think twice before engaging in nativist shenanigans in the immigration debate			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210			0

@entity210 : @entity26 borrow the @entity3 's playbook of nativist shenanigans
@entity210 : a *progressive* super pac attacks @entity84 , wife of sen. @entity60
he says the group resorted to @entity64 fears to stir resentment against @entity66
@entity210 : when @entity26 do such things , they lose the moral ground to criticize @entity3
