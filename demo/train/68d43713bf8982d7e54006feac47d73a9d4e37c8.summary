@entity0 -- @entity4 has begun high - level internal discussions on how to protect @entity7 's mustard gas supplies if the stockpile suddenly was deemed to no longer be secure , an @entity3 administration official tells @entity1			1
at this point the effort is considered " prudent planning " only , the official said , but this is the first indication the international community could be prepared to secure the stockpile currently at the @entity15 site south of @entity16			1
the mustard gas is not weaponized and would be difficult to use in any immediate attack			1
but much of the concern is that material could be diverted or sold to third parties such as terrorist groups			1
the @entity24 is involved in the safeguard discussions , but there is no current consideration of sending @entity24 troops the official said			0
the focus of the planning effort is what to do " if a force of some type is needed to secure the site , " he said			2
" the discussion is : who is best suited to do it ? " any force could include both military personnel as well as intelligence or contractor personnel with the technical expertise in monitoring chemical stockpiles			0
a @entity4 official said if there is a need to send personnel to @entity51 it might be done by individual nations rather than the alliance which would have to reach a consensus on sending @entity4 forces on a new mission			0
at the moment no one has publicly said whether @entity60 's forces or rebel forces are in control of @entity15 , although @entity24 officials have said for days they believe the stockpile is secure			2
the discussions have accelerated in recent days as the @entity60 regime began to collapse			0
" we are watching the chemical weapons and scud missiles to make sure they are not used in the endgame , " a senior @entity4 official told @entity1 .			0
