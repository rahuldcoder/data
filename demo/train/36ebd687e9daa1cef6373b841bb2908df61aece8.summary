@entity0 -- a federal judge has again temporarily blocked enforcement of key parts of a tough immigration law in @entity6			1
the ruling wednesday is a partial victory for both sides			0
the @entity9 had brought suit against state officials to block the law , but @entity6 was given the power to enforce some controversial sections			2
other opponents of the measure -- including state church leaders and the @entity18 -- had asked @entity20 judge @entity19 to stop the law , which had been scheduled to go into effect last month			1
" there is a substantial likelihood that the @entity20 will succeed on the merits of its claim that ( parts of the law ) are pre-empted by federal law , " @entity23 wrote			0
" the court further finds that the @entity20 will suffer irreparable harm if these sections of @entity34 are not enjoined " from taking effect			2
the ruling means certain parts of the law can not be enforced until a hearing on the larger issues raised in the appeal are resolved , a process that may take several months at least , and may ultimately have to be settled by the @entity20 @entity43			1
at issue is whether @entity34 intrudes on the federal government 's power over all immigration matters			2
state officials argue the law would help @entity6 and not violate civil rights			2
the court upheld a section of the @entity6 law requiring that police " attempt to determine the immigration status of a person who they suspect is an unauthorized alien of this country , " according to an @entity62 fact sheet			1
that provision is similar to other laws aiming to crack down on illegal immigration passed by other state legislatures over the past year			1
but @entity23 blocked the following provisions from being enforced : -- one saying undocumented aliens in the state are not allowed to " knowingly apply for work , solicit work in a public or private place , or perform work as an employee or independent			1
" -- one banning the " concealing , harboring , transporting , etc. , of unlawfully present aliens			2
" -- one prohibiting employers from " taking of a state tax deduction for wages paid to an unauthorized alien			1
" but the @entity6 law also includes more expansive measures , including requiring the state to check immigration status of students in public schools , that the judge allowed to go into effect for the time being			1
during court hearings earlier this summer in @entity89 , @entity6 , an attorney with the @entity91 argued the public school portion of the law is unconstitutional			1
@entity6 attorney general @entity95 told the judge at the hearing the law would not prevent undocumented immigrants from having access to public school education			1
@entity95 also argued that the law is not an anti-immigrant measure , and that the state welcomes visitors			1
the judge in late august had issued a preliminary injunction against enforcement , saying she needed more time to decide the complex legal questions raised			2
in august , leaders from the @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 churches of @entity6 separately sued @entity6 's governor , its attorney general and a district attorney over @entity34			0
on wednesday , bishops from two of those churches welcomed the decision to block the provision preventing the harboring or transporting of undocumented aliens , releasing a joint statement saying it " protects our churches ' ministries from prosecution under this over-reaching law , and substantially protects our religious liberties			2
" " we will continue to provide food , shelter , transportation , housing , and the church 's sacraments to all of @entity144 's people , regardless of race , class , or citizenship status , " said the statement from bishop @entity133 of the @entity112 's @entity134 and bishop @entity135 of the @entity113 's @entity136			0
but @entity6 gov. @entity148 , who signed the law in june , said after wednesday 's ruling that " judge @entity23 upheld the majority of our law and temporarily -- and i say temporarily -- enjoined in four sections			0
in those parts that were upheld we have the strongest immigration law in this country			0
" he said law would not have been needed " if the federal government would have done its job and enforced the laws dealing with this problem			0
however , they have failed to do that			0
" and he added , " this law was never designed to hurt fellow human beings			0
" @entity167 @entity6 state rep. @entity166 told @entity1 in june that the legislation would be " good for @entity6 " because it would reduce illegal immigration to the state and " provide equal opportunities for all people who want to come to @entity6 legally			1
" @entity18 attorney @entity173 noted the complexity of @entity6 's law compared with other state measures			0
the @entity178 government had also appealed , arguing the law would promote racial profiling , targeting @entity181 especially			0
@entity6 's law is considered the strictest in the nation			0
key portions of @entity185 's immigration reform law have also been blocked while a federal appeals court and the @entity20 @entity43 consider various challenges			1
the @entity6 case is @entity20 v. @entity6 ( 2:11 - cv - 2746 )			0
@entity1 's @entity191 and @entity192 contributed to this report .			0

the measure ca *n't* be enforced until a hearing on larger issues
the @entity43 may end up taking the case
the judge allows the state to check the immigration status of public school students
