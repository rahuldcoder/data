-- @entity1 has a new prime minister			0
and its first female premier , defeated in a decisive vote 57 - 45 in favor of the man she ousted in 2010 , has now resigned			1
with observers suggesting her government faces a landslide defeat in september 's election , prime minister @entity9 was very much a leader under siege from within her own ranks when she called for a leadership ballot			1
" i would n't be putting myself forward unless i had a degree of confidence about the support of my colleagues , " she told @entity1 's @entity17 in an exclusive interview ahead of wednesday 's ballot			1
@entity9 added that she would retire from politics if she lost the vote and the support of her parliamentary colleagues			1
she urged whoever challenged her to do the same			0
@entity9 did not however name @entity29 who promised to exit political life if he failed to win the support of his parliamentary colleagues			1
the change in the leadership of the @entity34 comes a little over three years since @entity9 toppled @entity29 in a coup dubbed " the night of the long knives , " and backed by key party power brokers			1
that was june 24 , 2010			0
@entity9 went into a federal election in august 2010 with the @entity34 failing to win an outright majority in the parliament			1
she has since ruled with the support of three independents and a @entity45 member			0
but the political and public disquiet over the toppling of a sitting prime minister never abated			0
hugely popular among @entity50 , @entity29 , then foreign minister , challenged @entity9 for the leadership in february 2012			1
he overwhelmingly lost the ballot and was relegated to the backbenches			2
@entity9 's strength of character has consistently been on display throughout her leadership			1
as leader , she is widely acknowledged to have deftly dealt with the challenges of a hung parliament			2
her government has formulated and negotiated several critical pieces of legislation : a national disability insurance scheme and , on the day she lost power , a new formula to fund government schools			0
her feisty performance in parliament in october 2012 , when she described opposition leader @entity69 as a misogynist , won her much admiration around the world			2
but among voters at home , she has experienced a steady decline in popularity			0
in the past two weeks , polls showed her government would be overwhelmingly defeated in the election she had called for september 14			0
if the poll numbers hold through to the election , more than 30 @entity34 members of parliament will lose their seats			2
the slings and arrows rarely stopped coming throughout her three - year tenure -- with much of the criticism becoming personal			0
@entity9 has been criticized over her voice ( described by many as nasal and monotone ) , the length of her nose , her fashion choices , and even her figure			2
whether @entity50 found it difficult to accept a female prime minister or not , her leadership placed sexism , particularly in public life , firmly on the agenda			1
@entity9 put the issue of misogyny back under the spotlight three weeks ago when she spoke to a new " @entity107 " support group and questioned if the opposition coalition would re-open the abortion issue in @entity1 if it won power in september			2
@entity112 , rather than federal , law governs abortion			0
many @entity34 backbenchers openly criticized @entity9 for re-opening the issue , along with high profile feminists			1
it was viewed largely as a political stunt as was her reference in the same speech to the opposition coalition 's " men in blue ties , " who she said would banish women from political life			0
the speech saw a 7 % decrease in support for her @entity34 in a poll subsequently released			2
but the sexism issue also proved to be as damaging for political opponents -- particularly when the menu at a @entity135 fundraiser recently was leaked to the media			0
it described a main meal of quail with " small breasts , huge thighs and a big red box			0
" strongly condemned by opposition leader @entity69 , and despite denials that the menu was written as a joke by the owner of the restaurant where the fundraiser was to be held and was not endorsed by the @entity135 , " menu-gate " as it became known , added credence to @entity9 's argument			1
in the same week , while in @entity1 to discuss her reforms to education funding , @entity9 was asked by a radio shock jock whether her partner , @entity152 , a former hairdresser , was homosexual			2
the implication of the question was that her relationship was a sham given @entity9 's refusal to marry , which has played poorly among some voters			1
" well , that 's absurd , " responded @entity9			1
@entity160 who was later sacked			0
" you hear it ! he must be gay ; he 's a hairdresser , " @entity160 continued			0
shortly afterward the shock jock was suspended by his employer over the interview a few days later , another radio announcer criticized @entity9 for showing too much cleavage			2
" i do n't think it 's appropriate for a prime minister to be showing her cleavage in parliament ... i just think it is inappropriate			0
i do n't want to see any politician 's flesh in parliament , " @entity174 told an @entity176 program			0
following these comments , @entity9 's army of female supporters took to posting photographs of their breasts on @entity184 using the hashtag " convoyofcleavage			1
" but over the past two weeks , @entity9 's staunchest parliamentary and ministerial supporters have declared their continued support for her			1
as her popularity among voters waned , @entity29 took to the streets where reaction to his every appearance was of a rock star proportion			2
@entity29 consistently denied he would challenge @entity9 for the leadership			1
he was a " no show " in march this year when @entity9 reacted to leadership chatter by calling a ballot that was not contested			1
but on wednesday , as his supporters gathered signatures to a petition calling for another ballot , he changed his mind			0
he said @entity50 wanted a real choice			0
" at present , they do n't feel as if they have got one , " @entity29 told a news conference ahead of the ballot			1
" they are frustrated and angry that we are leaving them with little choice other than to vote for mr @entity69			0
" widely credited with having steered @entity1 through the global financial crisis , @entity29 told the conference @entity1 needed his steady economic leadership because the country 's resources boom was ending			1
" given our economic relationship with @entity220 accounts for 10 % of our economy this is a massive challenge , " @entity29 said			2
" diversification is essential for @entity1 if we are to protect our jobs and maintain our living standards			0
" @entity29 also promised he would not seek retribution against any of his parliamentary colleagues who , since the last leadership ballot he lost in march 2012 have paraded their disdain for him			1
he said he would embrace those wanted to continue working with him and would thank those who refused , for their services			0
the decision to change leader may now trigger a constitutional crisis if the country 's governor general demands proof that the @entity239 speaking @entity29 can harness the support of the parliament .			1

@entity243 's @entity34 voted her out of its leadership for former premier @entity29
