" if i was from the @entity32 , i 'd vote for @entity9 , " @entity6 said buoyantly on state television just a week before he won his third six - year term two weeks ago , potentially extending his tenure to two decades			1
" @entity9 is a good guy			1
" @entity1 is still hungover from its own presidential election and in this fervently political country — mostly thanks to @entity6 's ubiquity , strength of personality and polarizing policies — the @entity32 election campaign offers some light relief after a trying few months			1
map : the world weighs in on the @entity32 election the contest between @entity6 and @entity45 , the @entity1 opposition 's first real hope in 14 years , made the @entity13 - @entity9 matchup look like child 's play			1
@entity6 welcomed his opponent to the ring in february by calling him a " low - life pig " who would be " pulverized			2
" there were no debates here as @entity6 felt @entity45 was below him			0
" the eagle does not chase flies , " said a defiant @entity6			0
postcard : why @entity59 , @entity32 are kindred spirits the self - styled socialist leader 's supporters see @entity9 taking a leaf out of @entity6 's book			1
" @entity9 is working for the people just like @entity6 , " said @entity65 , 42 , stood under a huge @entity21 mural in a primarily @entity6 - supporting @entity0 barrio			2
however , it is the contenders ' world views which really matter here			0
@entity73 helped organize prayer vigils for @entity6 as he suffered cancer last year			0
" @entity9 's policies towards @entity12 have n't been aggressive , " she said , offering her support for the @entity32 incumbent before adding : " the other guy does n't seem to have any friendly intentions towards us ! " @entity1 has come up a number of times in @entity85 rhetoric during the @entity32 race			1
@entity13 branded the @entity1 government a " threat to national security " earlier this year , adding that @entity6 had spread " dictatorships and tyranny throughout @entity12			1
" postcard : @entity9 's ' hope ' a mirage for hostile @entity95 @entity13 's running mate , @entity96 , added : " in a @entity13 administration , we will not keep practicing this policy of appeasement ... we will be tough on [ @entity102 president @entity101 , tough on @entity6			1
it 's because we know that 's the right policy for our country			0
" this antagonism from the @entity13 camp towards @entity6 — compared to @entity9 's softer approach — has attracted some of @entity1 's more wealthy hard - line opposition			1
" @entity13 named @entity6 in his manifesto ; @entity9 did n't , " said @entity112 , eating breakfast at one of @entity0 ' high - end hotels			1
" @entity9 has closed his eyes to the problem , a regional problem , and he is too friendly with @entity6			2
" postcard : war - scarred @entity120 has little faith in election the lubricant between @entity0 and @entity124 is the world 's highest oil reserves on which @entity6 sits			2
it is that wealth that has kept @entity1 's economy from collapsing -- despite epic mismanagement which has led to the region 's highest inflation rate and a severe shortage of @entity32 dollars			1
@entity12 is @entity1 's biggest oil market and the @entity12 country is among the top five exporters to the @entity32			1
" the @entity32 remains the only actual customer paying cash and at full - price , " said @entity136 , head trader at @entity0 ' @entity137			0
" @entity13 may want to use that leverage to stop subsidizing a thorn in @entity12 's side			2
" @entity136 adds that @entity1 , or at least the @entity6 government , needs oil prices to stay high , and @entity9 may be a safer bet for that			1
" @entity9 is more willing to tolerate high gasoline prices because gas at $ 4 a gallon makes people more willing to invest in alternative technologies and for those technologies to be more cost effective			0
" postcard : @entity9 , @entity13 ignore @entity156 at own peril @entity6 is unlikely to be thinking in such depth			1
his support for @entity9 recently marks the apex of the 58 - year - old strongman 's relations with @entity124 since coming to power in 1999			2
the infamous nadir came in 2006 when @entity6 stood at the @entity166 lectern , theatrically sniffing the air			0
" the devil came here yesterday , " he said , a day after former president @entity169 's speech			0
" it smells of sulfur still			0
" he then went onto describe @entity169 's " domination , exploitation , and pillage of the peoples of the world			0
" @entity6 quipped two weeks ago that @entity9 would support him too , had he been born in @entity1 's slums			1
after some shaky relations , @entity6 is prepared to start again			0
" with the likely triumph of @entity9 , and the extreme right defeated both here and there [ in the @entity32 ] , i hope we can start a new period of normal relations			2
