-- it may have taken a while , but travelers struggling to get home after @entity5 weekend will get to sleep in their own beds soon			1
after more than 4,000 @entity9 flights were delayed and 244 were canceled sunday -- one of the busiest travel days of the year -- airports should be much less chaotic monday			1
as of early monday morning , about 130 flights were delayed and 22 were canceled , according to @entity13			1
air travelers monday probably wo n't see a repeat of the enormous lines like one at @entity18			1
there , the line for security screening got so bad that reporter @entity21 of @entity0 affiliate @entity22 measured it : 1.2 miles			2
so what caused this ? " this happens sometimes , " @entity27 spokeswoman @entity26 said , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity28			0
she said that between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. sunday , lines were long because " that is when most people are traveling for the holiday period			1
" but weather did n't play a big role at many major airports			0

ninety percent of travelers were expected to go by road , @entity60 predicted , helped by the lowest gas prices in five years			2
