expensive works of art offered as inducements are at the center of the latest series of damaging allegations around the bidding process for the @entity8 , a published report claimed			1
a painting , believed to be a @entity10 , was allegedly gifted to @entity11 ( @entity11 ) president and @entity14 executive member @entity13 in return for his support for the eventually successful @entity18 bid for the 2018 global showpiece			1
another @entity14 voting member , @entity21 , from @entity22 , was also the recipient of a landscape painting , given to him in a package wrapped in brown paper by @entity26 , a former @entity18 executive committee member working for his nation 's attempt to host the 2018 tournament , it is alleged in a report in @entity31			1
" allegations ' in the @entity31 relating to my actions in the 2018 and 2022 bidding processes are total fabrications , " said former @entity32 international star @entity13			1
" the matter has now been passed to my legal advisers			0
" @entity21 told the @entity31 that he believed the painting given to him , was " absolutely ugly " and he believed it had no value			0
he said he had not voted for the @entity18 bid			2
the newspaper 's latest revelations are based on evidence it supplied to a @entity46 parliamentary committee , which itself has been investigating the circumstances around the award of the @entity51 host countries , particularly in the light of @entity54 's failed bid for the 2018 competition			1
the @entity56 ( @entity57 ) has now published details of the investigations by the @entity31 which claim the @entity54 bid commissioned " high - level intelligence gathering and and surveillance on the other countries bidding to host the 2018 and 2022 @entity8			1
" it also claims @entity54 's bid used private security companies and a former member of the @entity46 government 's intelligence service @entity68 to gather information on its rivals			1
the previously unreported material contains a series of claims around the role allegedly played by @entity18 president @entity76 in making sure his country would host football 's premier competition , hard on the heels of winning the rights to stage the @entity82 earlier this year			1
it claims that @entity76 was initially skeptical about @entity18 's bid but had later thrown his full weight behind the process			1
" he ( @entity76 ) took a personal interest in the running of the bid in mid- 2010 , " the committee report reveals			2
under the heading , " intelligence relating to @entity105 " a series of allegations are revealed about @entity76 's role in brokering a major bilateral trade deal for gas with @entity95 , the winners of the 2022 bid , in exchange for each others votes and the votes of others of their supporters			2
the allegations also detail the plundering of @entity18 's national art collection , either from the vaults of the @entity112 in @entity113 or the @entity115 archives , as alleged kickbacks to @entity13 and @entity21			1
in a statement given to @entity120 , officials behind the @entity18 bid have also strongly denied any wrongdoing			2
" @entity18 2018 categorically rejects all of the allegations made in the @entity31 today as entirely unfounded speculation , " it said			1
" these allegations are not new , but the evidence has only ever indicated that @entity18 2018 behaved professionally and fairly throughout the bidding process			1
" the @entity18 2018 @entity128 operated in full compliance with the spirit and letter of @entity14 's @entity132 , and sought to abide by the @entity14 bidding guidelines at all times			1
" this kind of speculation will not affect @entity18 2018 's focus on doing what we have been doing for nearly four years already : making great progress towards our objective of hosting the best ever @entity51 in 2018			1
" the alleged pivotal role of @entity14 president @entity143 in the bidding process is also highlighted in the published reports of the @entity57 and the @entity31			2
the claim is made that @entity143 and @entity76 " jointly ' hit the phones ' to drum up votes for @entity18 on the eve of the secret ballot in @entity151 on december 2 , 2010			1
" @entity143 was " absolutely committed " to the @entity18 bid it was said			2
earlier this month , football 's world governing body published a report that cleared @entity18 and @entity95 of any wrongdoing in their winning of the hosting rights for the 2018 and 2022 @entity8			1
but within hours of the announcement , @entity160 , the @entity161 attorney who had led the investigation , went public with his disappointment at the findings , labeling them " incomplete and erroneous " and claiming that his work had been misrepresented			0
the saga took a further twist when @entity14 later announced it had lodged a criminal complaint in the @entity172 courts into the " possible misconduct of individual persons in connection with the awarding of the hosting rights of the 2018 and @entity178			0
" @entity14 told @entity120 sunday that it was unable to comment on the specific allegations in the @entity57 and @entity31 reports			2
" matters related to the 2018/2022 inquiry are solely handled by the @entity184 of the independent @entity185 , " it said			0
" therefore we are not in a position to comment on on - going proceedings nor on names and other information circulated in the media , particularly as we do not know against which individuals and for what reasons investigations are in process nor do we know the details of what is actually in the investigation reports			0
" it added : " the independent chairman of the audit and @entity202 is currently evaluating the matter to decide on the next steps including the compiling of relevant information from the investigation which needs to be provided to the @entity208			0
" in parallel , the entire reports have been provided to the @entity172 general attorney			0
as such , @entity14 has no further comment for the time - being			0
" meanwhile , the @entity213 also responded sunday to the reports , claiming that the 2018 bid chairman @entity215 and his team had fully co-operated with the original @entity14 investigation			2
" the @entity220 made specific requests and responding to these requests involved searching in excess of 500,000 documents , " the @entity219 newspaper reported			0
" the search parameters were established with mr @entity160 's office			0
the documents searched included intelligence gathered by the bid team			0
all documents within the search parameters were disclosed			0
" it added that @entity215 had only shared with @entity160 information that could be substantiated			0
" everything else was hearsay , gossip and rumor , " it added			0
