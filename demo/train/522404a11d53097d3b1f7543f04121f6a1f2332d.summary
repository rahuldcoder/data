the @entity0 unanimously approved a resolution on @entity2 on wednesday that calls for an immediate ceasefire and includes sanctions for those involved in violence there			1
the @entity0 's move came amid worsening conflict in @entity2 -- and a day after the @entity10 said it believes @entity11 and the @entity12 have been conducting secret airstrikes in the @entity15 nation			1
that claim has been denied by @entity11 leaders and apparently dismissed by a @entity12 minister			1
the allegation was first made at the weekend by militants from an alliance of @entity23 and @entity24 militias -- known as the @entity2 @entity26 forces -- who have been battling rival moderate militias from the western city of @entity30			0
the alliance wrested control of @entity33 from the @entity30 militia groups saturday night after airstrikes targeting locations held by their own forces			0
the claims of outside military intervention have sparked fears that @entity2 has become the latest arena in a regional battle for influence between @entity11 , @entity44 and the @entity12 on one hand and @entity46 and @entity47 on the other			1
@entity2 continues to be beset by instability -- politically , militarily and otherwise -- nearly three years after the revolution that toppled former strongman leader @entity51			0
that has included extensive violence , much of it involving increasingly powerful militias that have outgunned the nation 's central government			0
late last month , the @entity58 @entity57 in @entity33 , the @entity59 and other international organizations and businesses evacuated their staffs due to the unrest			0
the @entity59 resolution calls for an end to the fighting and for those responsible to be held accountable			2
it also urges " all parties to engage in an inclusive @entity2 - led political dialogue in order to help restore stability , and to forge consensus around the next steps in @entity2 's transition			0
" the resolution does not mention any claims of bombing by outside forces			0
@entity58 urges political process rear adm. @entity80 , the @entity10 press secretary , confirmed at a briefing tuesday that the @entity58 believes that airstrikes were undertaken in recent days by the @entity12 and @entity11 inside @entity2 but declined to give further details			1
asked if the @entity10 supported independent action by the @entity12 and @entity11 in @entity2 , he said it , like the @entity58 government , wants @entity2 's problems to be resolved " peacefully , and through good governance and politics and not violence , and that we discourage other nations from taking a part in @entity2 's issues through violence			1
" @entity95 spokeswoman @entity94 gave a similar message , saying , " we understand that there were airstrikes undertaken in recent days by the @entity12 and @entity11			1
" she pointed to a joint statement issued monday by the @entity58 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity104 governments which calls for an immediate ceasefire in @entity2 by all sides and engagement in the democratic process			2
" we believe outside interference in @entity2 exacerbates current divisions and undermines @entity2 's democratic transition , " the statement concludes			0
the @entity58 does n't believe there is a military solution in @entity2 , @entity94 said			0
" the political process is what the focus needs to be on			0
and , hence , the concern that we have			0
" in a tweet later tuesday , @entity94 appeared to seek to clarify her earlier remarks			0
" comment today on @entity2 intended to refer to countries reportedly involved , not speak for them , " she said			2
@entity11 ' has no forces in @entity2 ' @entity11 has repeatedly denied any military involvement in @entity2			1
" @entity11 is not involved in any military activity and it does not have any military presence on @entity2 territories , " @entity11 foreign minister @entity125 said tuesday			1
" we respect the @entity2 people 's will represented by the parliament and all its decisions			0
" @entity11 @entity135 spokesman @entity134 told @entity136 on monday that suggestions @entity11 was involved in recent airstrikes are " nonsense			1
" a day earlier , @entity11 's president @entity140 also denied any @entity11 involvement in @entity2 , according to the official @entity11 news agency , @entity142			1
he told newspaper chiefs that are no @entity11 aircraft or forces in @entity2 and that no @entity11 aircraft took any military action inside @entity2 territory			1
@entity140 added that @entity11 , like its neighbors , is interested in the safety and security of @entity2 and has been consulting with @entity153 and @entity154 and others over political action to achieve stability there			2
the @entity12 has not given an official response to the allegation it was involved in airstrikes			2
but @entity12 minister of state for foreign affairs @entity161 appeared to dismiss the initial claim by @entity2 islamists in remarks on @entity165 , translated by @entity136			1
" the attempt to drag the @entity12 into the @entity2 issue is an escape from facing the results of the elections and the legitimacy that it brought about and the desire of the majority in @entity2 for stability and security , " he said in one tweet			2
his comment referred to elections in june that brought a new @entity181 government to power in @entity2			0
however , the new administration has so far proved ill - equipped to quell the violence plaguing @entity2 .			2

@entity0 resolution includes sanctions for those involved in violence in @entity2
it demands an immediate ceasefire and end to fighting in @entity2
the @entity10 believes @entity11 and the @entity12 carried out airstrikes in @entity2
