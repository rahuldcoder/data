@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 told @entity2 saturday that in defending the right of @entity7 to build a community center and mosque near ground zero in a speech on friday night , he was " not commenting on the wisdom " of the project			1
instead , @entity3 said he was trying to uphold the broader principle that the government should treat " everyone equal , regardless " of religion			2
his comments were seen as step back from the support he appeared to give the controversial project during a @entity22 dinner on friday , though a spokesman for the administration quickly moved to clarify the president 's remarks			1
" just to be clear , the president is not backing off in any way from the comments he made last night , " @entity22 spokesman @entity27 said in a statement saturday afternoon			1
" it is not his role as president to pass judgment on every local project			2
but it is his responsibility to stand up for the @entity40 principle of religious freedom and equal treatment for all @entity43 , " @entity27 added			0
@entity3 , speaking on saturday after giving a speech on the @entity46 oil disaster in @entity0 , @entity1 , told @entity2 he " was not commenting and i will not comment on the wisdom of making the decision to put a mosque there , " referring to the area near ground zero			1
" i was commenting very specifically on the right people have that dates back to our founding , " the president added			2
" in this country , we treat everybody equally and in accordance with the law , regardless of race , regardless of religion			0
" at a @entity22 dinner celebrating the @entity66 holy month of @entity67 , @entity3 seemed to throw his support behind a controversial proposal to build an @entity66 center and mosque near @entity73 's ground zero , saying friday that " @entity7 have the same right to practice their religion as anyone else in this country			1
" " that includes the right to build a place of worship and a community center on private property in lower @entity83 , in accordance with local laws and ordinances , " @entity3 said			1
the president 's remarks drew praise from @entity73 mayor @entity90 , who announced his support for the @entity66 center last week			1
@entity90 compared @entity3 's speech to a letter former president @entity95 wrote in support of a @entity98 congregation in @entity99 , @entity100			1
rep. @entity101 ( @entity102 - @entity73 ) , whose district includes ground zero , praised @entity3 's remarks on saturday			1
" the @entity43 was founded on the principle of religious liberty and tolerance , and it is equally important 234 years later that we uphold this principal			0
hate should have no place in @entity43 , " @entity101 said in a statement			0
still , critics of the proposed @entity66 center -- including @entity117 and rep. @entity118 ( r - @entity73 ) -- quickly denounced @entity3 's comments			1
" president @entity3 is wrong , " @entity118 said in a statement friday night			1
" it is insensitive and uncaring for the @entity7 community to build a mosque in the shadow of @entity126			1
unfortunately , the president caved into political correctness			0
" @entity117 , the former @entity129 candidate for vice president , also weighed in			0
" we all know that they have the right to do it , but should they ? " she tweeted on saturday			0
@entity3 , who on friday said he was speaking both as a citizen and as president , invoked the attacks of sept. 11 , 2001 , which critics of the @entity66 center cite as the main reason for blocking its construction			1
" we must all recognize and respect the sensitivities surrounding the development of lower @entity83 , " he said			0
" the 9/11 attacks were a deeply traumatic event for our country			0
" " the pain and suffering experienced by those who lost loved ones is unimaginable , " @entity3 continued			2
" so i understand the emotions that this issue engenders			0
ground zero is , indeed , hallowed ground			0
" the proposed @entity66 center has provoked vocal opposition from some families of 9/11 victims and other groups			0
nearly 70 percent of @entity43 oppose the plan , according to a @entity2 / @entity160 released wednesday			2
" in a breathtakingly inappropriate setting , the president has chosen to declare our memories of 9/11 obsolete and the sanctity of @entity126 finished , " @entity165 , co-founder of 9/11 families for a @entity167 , said in a statement			0
the @entity66 center 's leaders say they plan to build the $ 100 million , 13 - story facility called @entity173 three blocks from the site of the 9/11 attacks			2
the developer , @entity177 , describes the project as an " @entity179 " that would include a 500 - seat performing arts center , a lecture hall , a swimming pool , a gym , a culinary school , a restaurant and a prayer space for @entity7			1
other families of 9/11 victims said they support the proposed @entity66 center , and the president 's position			1
" @entity43 , the concept and the people and the land thrive when we chose to trust in our principles rather than cave to our basest fears , " @entity191 , spokeswoman for september 11th @entity192 , said in a statement			0
" what better place for healing , reconciliation and understanding than @entity126 ? " she added			0
on wednesday , the project 's developers declined an offer by @entity73 gov. @entity208 to relocate the project to a state - owned site			0
earlier this month , the @entity211 unanimously denied landmark status for the building where the proposed @entity66 center would stand , allowing the project to move forward			2
