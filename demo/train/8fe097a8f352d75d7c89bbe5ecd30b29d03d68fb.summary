@entity0 , @entity1 -- the young cheetahs chirped as a veterinarian gave them a quick but thorough checkup at the @entity6			1
" people always expect them to sound like scary carnivores , but they sound more like little birds , " @entity7 said			0
the two cheetahs had been separated from their mother so they could be vaccinated , weighed and swabbed for @entity13			1
while both cubs are attached to their mother , only one can truly call her mom			1
zoologists at the @entity17 have cross-fostered a cheetah cub , persuading a female cheetah to become a foster mom to an at - risk cub			1
cross-fostering cheetah cubs is rare , having been done six times within the @entity25 captive cheetah population			1
single - cub cheetahs are usually at risk because their mothers do n't produce enough milk			1
after two cubs were born to different mothers at the zoo , officials decided to have one mom tend to both to ensure their chance of survival			2
the male cub was born first in december to first - time mother @entity38			1
" a cheetah female ca n't produce enough milk for just one cub because a single cub wo n't stimulate mom enough to keep producing milk , " cheetah biologist @entity40 said			1
" we hand - raised the first cub for about 13 days			1
" when another singleton female cub was born to 9 - year - old @entity50 , the zoo biologists decided to sneak the first cub in with the second and see if @entity50 would raise both as her own			1
they took steps to transfer the smell of one cub to the other by doing things such as rubbing them together			2
then they put the two cubs in a box together and let @entity50 in			0
the big cat immediately went to the cub that was n't naturally hers			2
" she picked him up , she immediately started grooming him			0
and then laid down in the nest box with him , and it took about 20 to 30 minutes before she realized that there were two cubs in there with her , " @entity40 said			0
@entity50 has since proven to be a model mother			0
within an hour , she was feeding and grooming both			0
cheetahs are considered to be vulnerable on the @entity74 's @entity73			2
researchers estimate that there are 7,000 to 12,000 cheetahs in the world , down from about 100,000 at the beginning of the 20th century			1
" hey buddy , nice teeth , " @entity80 told the young male as he took a look in his mouth and swabbed a sample for dna testing			0
the female let out a loud chirp as the veterinarian tried to swab her mouth			2
" she 's getting a little worked up , " @entity80 said			0
biologists are not sure who the real father of the little girl is , hence the dna testing			0
" last year , we had our new young male coalition , and we wanted to literally teach them about female cheetahs and how to breed because they were very young and inexperienced , " @entity40 said			1
" it 's always a good management tool to put experienced cats with inexperienced cats			0
so we were training our younger males with that older experienced female , and she actually bred two of the boys in one day			2
so we are not sure which of the boys fathered the second cub			0
" @entity40 pointed out that genetics will determine the future of the cubs			0
they 'll stay with @entity50 for another year , but they will likely get a breeding recommendation and go to other breeding centers .			0
