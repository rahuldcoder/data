@entity0 , @entity1 from the @entity8 stadium as a show of force from @entity0 's working poor			1
in a matter of weeks , more than 3,000 families joined the squatters settlement known as the " @entity14 , " hoping to use the global sporting event as a platform to pressure the government to provide low - income housing			1
on a recent morning , @entity19 was working in the communal kitchen -- a lean - to made from plastic tarps and plywood -- preparing lunch for families in her quadrant			1
she said her rent in @entity0 's @entity27 nearly doubled when the stadium was being built			1
" we paid 700 reais ( $ 314 ) on rent , then food and clothes , it was too much , " she says			0
she , her husband and four daughters now camp out in a small tent stacked with mattresses , hoping to persuade the government to build subsidized housing on the occupied land			2
" we do n't want anything for free , but we need something we can pay , " said the young manicurist			0
" if we can pay 700 reais a month for rent , we could pay that in installments for a housing unit			2
" rising rent during the day , the tent city is a maze of mostly empty lean - tos			1
new arrivals show up to pitch tents and get themselves on the list of house seekers coordinated by the @entity56			0
sometimes it is an entire family living in a tent			0
in other tents , family members take turns in spending the night there			0
rents in the city have risen by double digits in recent years , far outpacing the increase in minimum wage , which is $ 360 a month in @entity0			2
in the @entity27 , a simple two - room apartment now costs around $ 300			0
but it is hard to say whether the @entity8 has had an impact on rents as the increases have been felt across the city , not just in the @entity27 where the stadium was built			1
at night , thousands of people pour into the settlement as families return from work and others show up for the nightly assembly			0
they tell us they wo n't even watch the @entity8 now			2

" let 's hear it for quadrant @entity94 , " she shouts and is greeted by a cheer from the crowd			0
@entity96 has been coordinating land invasions for the movement for eight years			0
she says the @entity8 has done nothing for @entity1 's lowest classes			1
" @entity101 and the stadium here in the @entity27 are n't going to leave the legacy that was expected , " she says			0
" the legacy is higher rents and pushing people further outside of the city to the peripheries			0
" popular pressure in the protests leading up to the games , @entity111 has become the biggest force out on the streets of @entity0 , with marches of more than 10,000			1
they lash out at the government for spending $ 11 billion on the @entity8 instead of schools , hospitals and public housing			1
all the pressure appears to have paid off			0
the government said this week that it is drawing up plans to build low - income housing on the land occupied by the @entity14 and that details of the project will be made public this month			1
but the families at the tent city say they 're ready to march on the @entity0 stadium at a moment 's notice if those guarantees fall through .			1

more than 3,000 families have put up tents and lean - tos near @entity8 stadium
they say they have been *priced* out of the rental market in @entity0 , @entity1
they hope to pressure the government to do more on low - income housing
