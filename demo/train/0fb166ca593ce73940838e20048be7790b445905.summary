-- may 17 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 , @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity14 , @entity15 : an economic face - off , a special graduation speaker , and a look at what happened on this day in history			2
i 'm @entity22 , and @entity0 is ready to take flight			0
first up : @entity24 unidentified @entity25 announcer : ... liftoff for the final launch of @entity28			2
expanding our knowledge , expanding our lives in space			0
@entity33 : the space shuttle endeavour taking off on its final endeavor			2
the launch was delayed due to mechanical problems , but @entity25 officials said those were all fixed			2
the shuttle and its crew are headed to the international space station			2
this is a 16 - day mission and the next - to - the - last mission for the space shuttle program			2
@entity46 has flown on @entity28 before			0
on that mission , she became the first @entity50 - @entity49 woman to travel into space			1
she said yesterday 's launch brought up mixed emotions			1
@entity46 , former astronaut : it 's very bittersweet , because it was a wonderful , beautiful launch			1
i was on the second mission of @entity28			0
when we spoke last year , we were there talking about the fact that the shuttle era was coming to an end , and now the @entity49 was putting more of its research money into how to do interplanetary travel , how to come up with the kinds of engines that are needed to go , to taking us to an asteroid			1
so , that transition is great , but it 's sort of hard to see the shuttle program ending			1
@entity72 @entity73 , @entity15 : today 's shoutout goes out to mrs. @entity76 's business class at @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity79 ! which of these words means failing to make required payments on time ? is it : a ) arbitration , b ) bankruptcy , c ) collusion or @entity88 ) default ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! when you default , it means you have n't made your payments on time			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity96 @entity33 : there 's a chance the @entity49 government could default on its debt , money that it has borrowed			1
@entity102 actually sets a limit on how much money the government can borrow			0
it 's called the debt ceiling			1
it 's kind of like the limit on a credit card : once you 've maxed out , you ca n't borrow any more			2
and the government is there , at that maxed - out limit : $ 14.294 trillion			0
if it ca n't borrow any more money , the government might not be able to pay its bills			0
that 's not a good thing			2
treasury secretary @entity118 told @entity102 yesterday that there are ways to keep things running for a few months , but he 's urging lawmakers to raise the country 's debt ceiling			1
that 's something lawmakers have been debating for a while now			2
@entity128 looks at some of the arguments from both sides			0
( begin video ) @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 , @entity136 : @entity137 want trillions in cuts and no tax hikes			0
@entity141 say tax hikes should be included in the mix. and they caution against tying the debt limit too closely to deficit reduction			2
@entity146 , white house press secretary : we believe that we can reach an agreement on significant deficit reduction within the same time frame that @entity102 needs to take action to raise the debt ceiling			1
but it simply would be folly , as i 've said before , to say that if we do n't get an agreement , or if we do n't get the agreement we want , then we 're just not going to raise the debt ceiling , come what may			1
lake : as politicians squabble , treasury secretary @entity118 has vowed to take " extraordinary measures " to allow the @entity49 to continue paying its creditors , including borrowing from federal pension plans			1
because of this , the @entity49 will not default on its debt immediately			1
but @entity118 says he 'll run out of options in early august			0
many in the @entity169 believe @entity102 must act by then , and creditors will be watching every step of the way			0
creditors like @entity174 , which holds more than $ 1 trillion worth of @entity49 treasuries , and @entity176 , which holds more than $ 890 billion worth of debt			1
over the years , the @entity49 has been forced to raise the debt ceiling 74 times since 1962 to pay for tax cuts , foreign wars and other spending increases			1
in fiscal year 2000 , total national debt stood at $ 5.5 trillion			2
since then , debt has almost tripled			2
most in @entity185 agree , not raising the debt ceiling , and defaulting on debt , would trigger a spike in borrowing rates and a loss of confidence in the ability of the @entity49 government to honor its obligations			1
a high stakes game of political chicken is underway , and the national debt clock is ticking			1
@entity197 , @entity0 , @entity136			0
( @entity198 ) this day in history @entity33 : on this day in history , may 17th , in 1792 , 24 stockbrokers and merchants signed the @entity203			0
in 1875 , @entity206 rode @entity207 to victory			0
it was the first running of the @entity210 , now one of the world 's most famous horse races			2
and in 1954 , the @entity49 @entity214 ruled on the case of @entity216 vs. @entity217 , saying that racial segregation in public schools is unconstitutional			1
border violence @entity33 : increased tension around the nation of @entity4 after protesters who support the @entity225 people fought with @entity4 forces on sunday			0
the violence broke out on " @entity228			0
" @entity229 is arabic for " catastrophe			0
" the day marks the time in 1948 when @entity231 were moved out of their homes after @entity4 was established			0
at least 12 people were killed in the fighting on sunday			0
hundreds of others were injured			0

@entity4 said the protesters were illegally crossing the border			0
@entity4 's prime minister said he hoped for a quick , peaceful resolution			2
but he added that @entity4 is determined to defend its borders			0
@entity49 & @entity5 @entity33 : there 's also been some tension between the @entity49 and @entity5 recently , especially after @entity49 forces killed terrorist leader @entity250 in @entity5			1
the country accused the @entity49 of violating @entity5 law by launching the attack on @entity250 inside of @entity5 borders			1
the @entity49 has questioned how @entity250 lived near a @entity5 military academy without being discovered			1
yesterday , @entity49 senator @entity256 , who 's the chairman of the @entity257 , traveled to @entity5			1
during the visit , he said the @entity49 does n't need to apologize for the raid that killed @entity250			1
but he said that it 's important for the two countries to find a way to resolve their differences , and he pointed out that the @entity49 and @entity5 still share the same goal			1
sen. @entity256 , ( @entity88 ) @entity265 : we must never lose sight of this central fact : we are strategic partners with a common enemy in terrorism and extremism			0
both of our countries have sacrificed too many citizens and troops in the fight , and many too many to consider abandoning this important relationship for one reason or another			0
far too much is at stake here			0
@entity280 @entity33 : @entity281 in @entity6 , @entity7 had a high - profile graduation speaker for this year 's ceremony : president @entity284			1
he was there because the school won this year 's @entity287			1
public high schools across the country were judged on how they prepare students for college and for careers			1
@entity293 used this video to show off some of the school 's achievements			1
that includes test scores higher than the state average and the school 's dramatically improved graduation rate			1
at yesterday 's commencement , president @entity284 said that @entity293 's progress should be an example for schools around the @entity49 @entity49 president @entity284 : today , @entity293 is a place that has proven why we ca n't accept excuses -- any excuses -- when it comes to education			1
in the @entity49 , we should never accept anything less than the best that our children have to offer			1
before we go @entity33 : before we go , we offer for you a little case of identity crisis			0
golden retrievers are supposed to hunt ducks			0
this one adopted them ! they even follow her around , as if she 's their mother			2
for instance , when it gets warm outside , they all cool off by pooling their resources			0
though with any other retriever , these feathered friends would be duck soup			0
the retriever will raise them for two months with dogged determination before they leave the nest ... or the pool			0
goodbye @entity33 : of course , the dog could 've ducked that kind of responsibility , but that kind of behavior would n't fit the bill			0
oh yeah : duck puns ! you ca n't deny it : they quack you up			0
i 'm @entity22 , and i 'm out !			0
