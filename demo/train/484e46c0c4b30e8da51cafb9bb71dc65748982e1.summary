@entity0 , @entity1 -- scared			1
and more than a little surprised			0
that 's how residents of northeast @entity1 are feeling some six weeks into the search for suspected cop killer @entity6			1
@entity6 , 31 , is accused in the september 12 ambush shooting that left cpl. @entity8 dead and trooper @entity9 wounded outside the @entity11 barracks in @entity12			1
he has eluded capture despite a massive manhunt around @entity15 , @entity1 , where his family has a home			1
late last week and early this week , @entity6 was reportedly spotted in a wooded area in the town of @entity0 , about 8 miles southeast of the @entity15 area			1
" it 's kind of scary -- a little bit nerve - wracking -- because we live so close to it , " said @entity22 , who rode the bus to school with @entity6 when they were children			1
now , she drives a bus for the @entity31 , which closed schools tuesday because of the search for @entity6			1
@entity22 remembered him as quiet , but not " weird , " and definitely not the type of person you 'd expect to kill a cop			0
" you hear of stuff like this , but you never know the person , or it 's like hours from you			2
you know , it 's on the news but it 's not ever close to home			2
so it 's a little bit scary , " said @entity22			1
' ready for a fight ' the hunt for @entity6 has turned life upside down for people inside the search area			1
helicopters buzz overhead and police seem to be everywhere , all the time			0
" every night , every day , but mostly at night , the helicopters would be flying over our house , waking us up at 1 o'clock in the morning , " said @entity56 , in @entity0			0
he said he 's not afraid , except at night , when he believes @entity6 might be on the move			1
" during the day , there 's too many police around and too much action going on , " @entity56 said			2
@entity64 described the presence of law enforcement in @entity0 as " constant			0
" the area is typically quiet			0
" big armored cars , and the police have all their vests and stuff on so they 're , like , ready for a fight it looks like to me , " he said			0
police have not spoken about a possible motive , other than that @entity6 has talked and written about hating law enforcement			1
authorities have said a review of a computer hard drive used by @entity6 shows that he had planned the attack for years			1
the manhunt has already cost several million dollars			2
it has involved as many as 1,000 officers at times , some from other states			2
" i did n't expect him to last out there this long , " @entity64 said about @entity6 , a self - styled survivalist			1
" but he must be , you know , prepared more than i thought or , you know , a lot of people thought			0
we did n't think he would make it this long			0
we did n't think it 'd go this long			0
" ' rather ... safe than sorry ' the search for @entity6 landed on one @entity0 resident 's doorstep			1
@entity103 arrived home from work recently and found his woods flooded with law enforcement			0
he said officials told him dogs had tracked @entity6 's scent to @entity103 's back door , but that 's as far as it went			1
" supposedly they got the scent to my house , so that does make me feel a little scared but , i mean , the way those guys looked , they were ready to go , so i know if i called 911 and they came here , i 'd be safe , " he said			0
@entity6 is familiar with the @entity0 area , having attended the high school and worked summers at a camp just to the west			1
fearing his possible presence , nearby @entity127 postponed a @entity130 parade and canceled trick - or - treating , urging children to celebrate at a local high school instead			2
officials who canceled school in the @entity31 similarly chose not to take the chance			0
parents , in large part , seem to agree that 's the right move			2
" they could have called us last night and told us , you know , hey school is closed			0
i could still be laying in bed for another hour , " a parent of a fifth - grade boy told @entity2 affiliate @entity145 on tuesday			2
but , he added : " i 'd rather them be safe than sorry			0
i mean , if he 's in the area they should keep the kids home			0
" @entity153 reported from @entity0 , @entity1			1
