would sending weapons to @entity1 block @entity3 from grabbing territory and stem violence in the volatile region ? or would it fuel further conflict and destabilize @entity9 ? that 's a key issue @entity12 leaders are weighing			1
and even as they tried to present a unified front at a press briefing monday , it was clear that it 's an area where @entity19 president @entity18 and @entity21 chancellor @entity20 do n't quite see eye to eye			1
@entity18 said he has n't decided yet whether to send arms to @entity1 forces defending their country against @entity3 - backed separatists , and he has n't set a deadline for when he will			1
but he insists it 's an option that should be considered if diplomacy fails			0
any weapons the @entity19 sends would not be meant to help @entity1 defeat the @entity3 army in an all - out battle , @entity18 said			1
" our goal has not been for @entity1 to be equipped to carry out offensive operations , " he said , " but to simply defend itself			2
" @entity20 said @entity9 diplomats are making " one further effort " at negotiating a deal			2
a key step is in the works : a possible meeting wednesday between @entity3 president @entity43 and @entity1 president @entity44			1
" i 've always said i do n't see a military solution to this conflict , " she said			1
" we have to put all our efforts in bringing about a diplomatic solution			0
" both @entity18 and @entity20 stressed the importance of working together			1
" there may be some areas where there are tactical disagreements			0
but the broad principle that we have to stand up for ... the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty is one where we are completely unified , " he said			0
@entity12 leaders can not stand idly by " and simply allow the borders of @entity9 to be redrawn at the barrel of a gun , " @entity18 said			2
@entity20 said the strong alliance between @entity9 and the @entity19 would thrive despite any differences			1
@entity3 's incursions on @entity1 's borders , she said , are too dangerous for @entity9 to tolerate			2
" i can only say that if we give up on this principle of territorial integrity of countries , then we will not be able to maintain the peaceful order of @entity9 that we 've been able to achieve , " she said			0
of course , those borders have already been redrawn once in the conflict			0
last year , @entity1 and @entity19 officials say @entity3 flooded @entity78 with troops ahead of its widely disputed annexation of the territory			1
@entity3 has steadfastly denied accusations that it 's sending forces and weapons into @entity1			1
but top @entity12 and @entity1 leaders have said there is n't any doubt that @entity3 is behind surging violence and separatists ' efforts to take over territory in eastern @entity1			1
@entity20 in the middle of a @entity19 - @entity3 standoff representatives of @entity3 , @entity1 , @entity21 and @entity95 were making preparations monday for a planned meeting wednesday in @entity98 , @entity99 , to discuss efforts to reach a ceasefire			1
if those talks fail , @entity19 lawmakers will likely ratchet up pressure on @entity18 to send weapons to @entity1			1
but even that gathering , which could be a significant meeting between @entity43 and @entity44 , is n't set in stone			0
" we are planning for wednesday if we succeed in settling the various points that we have discussed so intensively over these last days , " @entity43 said sunday			0
the big challenge facing @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity20 and @entity95 president @entity111 is whether they can reach a peace agreement that will stick			2
a peace agreement was signed in september in @entity98			0
it called for a drawback of heavy weapons , self - rule in the eastern regions and a buffer zone to be set up along the @entity3 - @entity1 border			2
but the agreement quickly disintegrated , and the violence continued			0
the new plan envisions a much broader demilitarized zone to run along the current front lines			0
all the while , the crisis in @entity1 , which stemmed from a trade agreement , has killed more than 5,000 people , including many civilians			0
at least 224 civilians were killed in the final three weeks of january alone , the @entity133 high commissioner for human rights said			0
@entity2 's @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 reported and wrote from @entity138			0
@entity2 's @entity139 in @entity140 , @entity141 in @entity142 , @entity143 and journalist @entity144 in @entity145 , @entity1 , and @entity146 in @entity138 , contributed to this report .			2
