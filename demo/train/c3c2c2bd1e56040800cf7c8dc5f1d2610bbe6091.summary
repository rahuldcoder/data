-- @entity2 astronomers say they have discovered conclusive proof of a supermassive black hole at the heart of the galaxy			1
the center of the galaxy is a " unique laboratory " for astronomical study			0
the 16 - year study involved tracking the movement of 28 stars at the center of the @entity14 using telescopes at the @entity16 in @entity17			1
using the data collected , astronomers were able to calculate important properties about the black hole -- called @entity22 -- such as its size and mass. professor @entity25 , who led the study at the @entity28 - based @entity27 , said the data collected proved the existence of the black hole " beyond any reasonable doubt			2
" " undoubtedly the most spectacular aspect of our long term study is that it has delivered what is now considered to be the best empirical evidence that super-massive black holes do really exist , " said @entity25			0
the black hole had a central mass concentration of four million solar masses , he added			1
the study also enabled astronomers to calculate the distance of the earth from the center of the galaxy , now measured to be 27,000 light - years , and enhanced by six times the accuracy to which they were able to measure the positions of stars -- the equivalent of seeing a one euro coin from a distance of 10,000 kilometers ( 6,214 miles )			1
one star , called @entity56 , orbited the center of the @entity14 so quickly that it completed one full revolution within the duration of the study			0
@entity25 said the center of the galaxy was a " unique laboratory " for the study of the strong gravity , stellar dynamics and star formation with a level of detail " never possible beyond our galaxy			0
" @entity71 , the chief author of the study , published in the @entity73 , said : " the @entity74 harbors the closest supermassive black hole known			2
hence , it is the best place to study black holes in detail			0
