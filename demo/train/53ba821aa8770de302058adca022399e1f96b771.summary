astronauts on the @entity3 will make a spacewalk sunday despite the appearance of water inside an astronaut 's helmet after a spacewalk earlier this week , @entity0 reported friday on its website			1
@entity0 said the suit worn by @entity0 astronaut @entity12 has a history of " sublimator water carryover			1
" water in the sublimator cooling component can condense when the suit is repressurized after a spacewalk , causing a small amount of water to push into the helmet , @entity0 said			1
@entity0 said @entity3 managers had " a high degree of confidence " in the suit			1
on the upcoming spacewalk , @entity26 and @entity27 will install antennas to provide data to visiting vehicles and deploy 400 feet of cable along the edge of the station			0
@entity12 said he first noticed traces of fluid and dampness in his helmet wednesday while he was waiting for the crew lock cabin to repressurize in the @entity3			1
he and @entity27 had been outside the space station for nearly seven hours working on the station 's robotic arm and performing some maintenance			0
@entity26 immediately alerted fellow astronaut @entity44 about the water and she alerted @entity46 in @entity47			2
@entity44 helped @entity26 out of his helmet and examined it			0
she confirmed the presence of moisture , mostly in the helmet absorption pad , or @entity53 , describing it as " wet and cold			0
" at the request of @entity46 , @entity54 used a syringe to draw as much water as he could from the top of the helmet			0
water had collected in the white plastic at the top and around both ear cups			0
@entity54 estimated there was 15 milliliters of water in the helmet			0
that 's a far cry from the amount of water that accumulated in @entity71 's suit during a spacewalk in july 2013			1
between 1 and 1.5 liters of water backed up in the suit and helmet , prompting fears @entity71 could drown in his own helmet			0
the spacewalk was cut short and @entity0 implemented some changes to its suits , including the addition of absorbent padding in helmets			2
there was another intrusion of water into the helmet during another spacewalk on december 24 , 2013			2
@entity0 commentator @entity89 said it was noticed at the same point in the mission as wednesday 's leak -- during the repressurization of the crew lock , the area from which astronauts enter and exit @entity3 while in space .			1

@entity0 says @entity3 astronauts will make a spacewalk on sunday
astronaut @entity12 found a small amount of water inside his helmet this week
