in the audio clips , @entity2 attempted to discredit an eyewitness in the case against him and downplayed what head coach @entity22 may have known about his activities			1
@entity22 family : @entity27 report ' factually wrong ' it was harmless fun @entity2 recalled in one anecdote trading swats with an undressed boy who was showering near him , but mentioned no sexual acts			1
he depicted it as mutual amusement for both the boy and him			0
" he would get the last smack , " @entity2 said , " and then i would chase him , like , and i ran him into a wall ... " @entity1 combined @entity2 's account with what he called evidence corroborating it			1

" i never saw @entity47			2
i do n't know if the young man saw him , " @entity2 told @entity1			2

@entity1 then held up a paper to @entity5 , allegedly a statement from the victim in @entity2 's narrative , saying that nothing happened			1
@entity47 was lying , the filmmaker suggested , because prosecutors encouraged him to			1
still , @entity1 said he believes @entity2 committed abuse with the horseplay behavior he described			2

@entity22 's family has objected to the recording 's release			1
" the @entity22 family would prefer to remain silent on this matter , " the family 's attorney , @entity102 , said in a written statement , " but they feel it is important to make it clear that they had no role in obtaining or releasing this recording			1
moreover , they believe that any attempt to use this recording as a defense of @entity22 is misguided and inappropriate			0
" the family advised the public to inform themselves via the website @entity121 and reports from official legal and law enforcement sources			0
but on their website , they have defended the iconic late head coach 's reputation , saying the allegations that he knew of the danger @entity2 posed are overblown			1
letters by @entity2 , wife blame everyone else a man on a mission @entity1 is passionate about his mission , and he has confidence in his opinion			0
those appear to be defining qualities , whenever he tackles an issue			0

he regularly lambasts the media			0
his list of favorite topics can be found on his website			0
