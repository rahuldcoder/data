-- a survey of @entity3 pilots has found concerns about the low - cost carrier 's safety culture , and support for an inquiry by regulators			1
@entity3 , @entity10 's largest budget airline by revenue , declined to comment on the survey on sunday , but said it had an " unblemished 29 - year safety record "			1
the survey was commissioned by the @entity15 , which is seeking to have the airline 's pilots represented by trade unions in negotiations on pay and working conditions			0
it contacted more than 1,000 captains and first officers at @entity3 -- more than one - third of the total number of pilots at the company			1
the survey was prompted by a warning in april by @entity30 , @entity3 's chief pilot and a senior manager , that any pilot signing a petition -- organised by the @entity15 and calling on regulators to evaluate whether the company 's employment model had an impact on the safety of flight operations -- would be liable for dismissal			1
of those participating in the survey , 89 per cent said that , following this memorandum from mr @entity30 , they did not consider that @entity3 had an open and transparent safety culture			0
mr @entity30 said in his memo that any pilot who had legitimate safety concerns should raise them through @entity3 's confidential safety reporting channel or with the @entity51			2
the survey found that 67 per cent did not feel comfortable raising safety issues through @entity3 's internal reporting system			1
it also found 94 per cent believed regulators should conduct an inquiry into the impact of @entity3 's employment practices on safety			1
@entity61 , chairman of the @entity15 's interim council , said it had a " strong suspicion " that the airline 's employment practices may be affecting flight safety , but had no proof , which explained why an inquiry was warranted by regulators			1
he added a majority of @entity3 's pilots were not employed directly but instead hired through agencies , and expressed concerns about their terms and conditions , saying many have so - called zero - hours contracts where there are no guaranteed working hours			2
" the results of the survey are reason for very great concern and call for immediate action [ by ] all involved parties , to get working on a solution and lowering these [ survey ] percentages sharply down , " said mr @entity61			0
@entity3 said it would not comment on the @entity15 or its survey , which is due to be outlined in a @entity89 " @entity90 " programme on monday			0
it also would not comment on whether any of its pilots were on zero - hours contracts			0
@entity3 's 2013 annual report said safety is the company 's " primary priority " , starting with the hiring and training of its pilots , flight attendants and maintenance staff			2
employees earn productivity - based incentive payments , including some for pilots based on their number of flying hours			0
but the annual report said @entity3 pilots are subject to limits of 900 flying hours each financial year , as determined by @entity112 regulators			0
it added the average number of flying hours by pilots in 2013 was approximately 798 -- a 5 per cent decline compared to 2012			0
