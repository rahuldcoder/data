-- for centuries , man has been on a quest to find the elixir to eternal life			0
alchemists struggled fruitlessly to create the legendary philosopher 's stone , a mythical substance capable of turning base metals into precious gold and said to hold the key to immortality			0
but perhaps they were going about it the wrong way			0
instead of searching for answers on land , maybe they should have been looking to the sea			0
in the seaside town of @entity22 , in @entity23 , one man thinks he knows what holds the key to everlasting life : jellyfish			1
@entity28 is a professor at @entity30 's @entity29			2
he began studying the gelatinous sea creatures in 1979 , and there 's one type with which he 's particularly preoccupied : the scarlet jellyfish			1
" they do n't die , " @entity28 says , " they rejuvenate			2
" he adds that they are one of three jellyfish species in @entity23 that are considered " immortal			1
" " one day in my plankton net , there was a small scarlet jellyfish from ( the ) south , which had many sharp sticks stuck into its body , " he recalls			1
" i thought ' poor thing ' and removed all of the sticks , hoping it may become better and swim again			0
but it did n't and shrunk			0
however , it rejuvenated ! " swimming with sharks , without a cage it 's less immortality and more regeneration , but @entity28 believes these tiny marine animals could hold the secret to perpetual life			1
when an adult scarlet jellyfish -- or medusa -- is injured , it goes to the bottom of the ocean floor			1
from there , it morphs back into its infant state , known as a polyp			0
then the polyp becomes a new medusa , allowing the jellyfish to move between an adult and infant state in about two months			0
@entity28 has succeeded in making one jellyfish rejuvenate an incredible 12 times in the lab. but there remain many unanswered questions			2
" there should be a key to rejuvenation in the system of scarlet jellyfish , " says @entity28			1
" i 'd like to believe it could be applied to human beings , because genetically , jellyfish and humans are not so different			2
" watch the video below to see more about @entity28 's work at the @entity29 and @entity23 's " immortal " jellyfish			1
photographer puts you face - to - face with sharks , by swimming uncaged ready for this jelly ? strange sea creatures invade beaches why are ' mousetronauts ' headed to space station ?			0
