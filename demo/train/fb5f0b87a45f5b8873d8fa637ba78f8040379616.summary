" but he said that the planned may 25 presidential vote @entity9 wants to hold would " not solve anything unless all of @entity1 's people first understand how their rights will be guaranteed " once the election has taken place			1

separatists in @entity1 's @entity27 region have scheduled a referendum for sunday			1
@entity3 called for the delay " in order to give this dialogue the conditions it needs to have a chance			2
" he said that direct talks between @entity9 authorities and representatives of the @entity38 sympathizers in southeast @entity1 were key to settling the escalating crisis			2
@entity1 interim prime minister @entity40 dismissed @entity3 's comments on the referendum as " hot air			1
" " there is no point in dealing in hot air , especially for the president of a big country			0
since @entity4 is asking to postpone some referendum on may 11 , i think the @entity4 president needs to be informed that there was no referendum planned on may 11 in @entity1 to begin with			1
" but if terrorists and separatists supported by @entity4 got an order to postpone something that does n't exist , then this is an internal matter , " he said			1
in march , voters in @entity1 's @entity60 approved a controversial referendum to secede from @entity1 and join @entity4 , which subsequently annexed the @entity60 region			1
that event highlighted the turmoil rocking @entity1			2

" @entity3 spoke after a meeting with @entity24 chairman @entity86			2
also from the @entity73 , president @entity87 notified @entity88 he intends to withdraw @entity4 's eligibility for trade benefits under the @entity91			1
" @entity4 is sufficiently advanced economically that it no longer warrants preferential treatment reserved for less advanced developing countries , consistent with the requirements of the @entity91 program , " the @entity73 said in a statement			2
violence in southeastern @entity1 also wednesday , @entity3 spoke about the release of @entity101 movement leader @entity100 , who was arrested on march 6 for leading an occupation of the regional administration office			1
" we welcome the release ... but we hope to see all the other political prisoners released , too			0
we think the most important thing now is to launch direct dialogue , genuine , full - fledged dialogue between the @entity9 authorities and representatives of southeast @entity1 , " he said			2
elsewhere , five @entity38 activists were killed overnight when @entity1 forces attacked barricades on the outskirts of @entity1 's southeastern city of @entity0 , a spokeswoman for the @entity38 camp said			1
@entity1 forces detained 15 other activists , @entity118 said			1
the violence comes amid an escalation of tensions as @entity1 forces seek to regain control of some of the administrative buildings seized by @entity38 separatists in a swath of the country 's south and east			1
the activists briefly abandoned the @entity132 building , according to @entity118			0
but the security forces remained in the building for only a short time , saying they had been ordered to leave			0

@entity1 's security services said 30 " heavily armed " militants had been killed in recent days as part of the " anti-terrorist " operation in the area			1
referendum plan as the tensions rise , uncertainty reigns			0
the eastern @entity27 and @entity169 regions had said they would hold a referendum on autonomy sunday , but there have been no visible preparations for a vote			0
in @entity9 , the interim government plans to hold presidential elections on may 25 , but it acknowledges it has lost control of part of the country			0
@entity4 foreign minister @entity180 on tuesday said it would be " unusual " to hold a presidential election in the country when the army was being deployed against the population			0
" in the situation where they use the army against their own population , it 's quite unusual			0
this is not @entity195 ; this is a completely different situation , " he said , adding that constitutional reforms promised by @entity9 's new leaders would not be implemented in time for the vote			0
@entity180 , speaking after a meeting of @entity199 foreign ministers in @entity200 , also ruled out holding a second international meeting in a bid to defuse the crisis in @entity1 , saying that the provisions of a first international pact signed in @entity206 , @entity207 , last month had yet to be put into force			0
the agreement called on all parties to refrain from violence and required illegal armed groups to disarm and vacate seized public buildings			0
' gravest crisis ' @entity9 and many in the @entity216 believe that the separatists are backed by @entity218 and fear that @entity3 is fomenting trouble to increase his influence in the region			0
in a briefing to @entity228 senators on tuesday night , the @entity87 administration provided a " sobering " assessment of @entity4 's intentions in @entity1 , including a concern that @entity3 will ultimately landlock the former @entity233 nation , multiple sources on @entity223 and in the @entity224 said			1
@entity4 now has its sights set on the southeastern port city of @entity236 and will not allow it to stay under @entity1 control because @entity218 views it as too crucial to both trade and the resupply of @entity4 troops in the occupied @entity242 region of @entity243 , the sources said			1
the ultimate goal would be to create a landlocked @entity1			0
in addition , the @entity228 sees no letup in @entity218 's direction of @entity38 separatists and paramilitaries inside @entity1 and the continuing presence of @entity4 agents and special forces on the ground , the sources said			1
but @entity218 says that right - wing , ultranationalist groups are behind the violence in @entity1 and that it has no direct influence over the pro-russian groups			0
the rising tensions could have an impact far beyond @entity1 's borders , @entity66 secretary general @entity259 warned tuesday			1
" today we are facing the gravest crisis to @entity267 security since the end of the @entity269 , " he told reporters			0
" but this is not just about @entity1			0
this crisis has serious implications for the security and stability of the @entity277 - @entity276 area as a whole			0
" a week in eastern @entity1 @entity1 crisis : small numbers , global impact @entity2 's @entity282 reported from @entity0 and journalist @entity283 from near @entity27 , while @entity284 wrote from @entity285			2
