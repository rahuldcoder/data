-- @entity1 , 57 , was anxious and depressed			2
after two years of intensive chemotherapy for late - stage colon cancer , and having outlived her prognosis by several months , she 'd finally lost hope			1
she was living in fear and was worried how her impending death would affect her husband			2
@entity1 's doctor prescribed antidepressants , but they did n't do any good			2
so , at her wits ' end and feeling that she had nothing to lose , @entity1 volunteered for an experimental depression treatment being studied at @entity18			2
in january 2005 , with a pair of trained therapists at her side , @entity1 took a pill of psilocybin -- a hallucinogen better known as the active ingredient in " magic mushrooms			2
" it may seem far - fetched that a psychedelic drug associated with muddy hippies at @entity30 would help a cancer patient at a university hospital			1
yet it 's an increasingly familiar scene			2
although mind - bending drugs such as psilocybin are still used most often by people looking to get high , researchers around the country have begun to explore whether these and other illegal drugs can help treat intractable depression , anxiety , and other mental - health problems			1
@entity0 : should you take antidepressants ? in the past month alone , studies have been published on the benefits of @entity48 ( better known as @entity48 ) in people with post-traumatic stress disorder and on the fast - acting antidepressive effects of the club drug ketamine ( aka " @entity53 " )			1
the study in which @entity1 took part is scheduled to appear in a major journal in early september			2
so far the studies have been small , but the results have been encouraging and bigger trials are on the horizon			1
drugs such as psilocybin and @entity48 can be dangerous in the wrong hands			1
but when taken under professional supervision and combined with therapy , researchers say , just one or two doses can help patients unlock the sources of their troubles and experience therapeutic breakthroughs that otherwise might take months or years			1
" it can be like psychotherapy sped up , " says psychiatrist @entity71 , @entity72 , an addiction expert at @entity73 who is leading a study on psilocybin treatment in cancer patients with severe anxiety			1
" their defenses are lowered , [ and ] they have enormous access to unconscious material			0
as the effects of the drug were wearing off , the therapists called in her husband , @entity88 , to see her			0
" there 's my @entity90 , " @entity88 recalls thinking			0
" she 's just beaming with light , and i have n't seen that joyousness for so long			0
she was just totally alive , she was totally happy			0
" @entity0 : 7 types of therapy that can help depression the return of the acid test scientists have been investigating the therapeutic effects of hallucinogens , mdma , and other synthetic drugs since the 1940s			1
in perhaps the most famous example , a team of researchers led by psychologist @entity105 explored the effects of psilocybin and @entity110 ( lysergic acid diethylamide , or " acid " ) in a series of experiments conducted at @entity114 in the early 1960s			1
but research into the potential benefits of psychedelic drugs ground to a halt in the early 1970s , after the federal government criminalized lsd and psilocybin -- and after the drugs were eagerly adopted by college students and the hippie counterculture			1
" these studies had to be shut down because of the cultural reaction , " says @entity124 , @entity72 , a professor of psychiatry at the @entity126 , in @entity127 , @entity128 , and the lead researcher of the study that included @entity1			1
" it kind of tarnished the image of the entire field			0
" the new wave of research on psychedelics -- " version 2.0 , " as @entity71 calls it -- began in the early 1990s , when the @entity140 sanctioned a few preliminary studies on psilocybin and @entity48			1
( the latter had been used in psychotherapy beginning in the 1970s , without the @entity140 's blessing , and was ultimately outlawed in 1985			0
) the research has picked up dramatically in the past few years			0
@entity0 : supplements for depression : what works the researchers are " going at it in the right way this time , " says @entity153 , @entity72 , a retired @entity140 medical officer who has been following the new crop of studies			1
" these drugs in the 60s were just let loose without any proper study			1
[ now ] they 're going through the @entity140 , through the process of clinical trials			0
" researchers have not been able to get federal grants , however			1
while the @entity140 has signed off on the studies , they have all been privately funded , most notably by nonprofit organizations such as the @entity165 ( @entity165 ) , in @entity166 , @entity128 , and the @entity167 , in @entity168 , @entity169			1
do n't try this at home the psilocybin study @entity71 is leading at @entity73 is typical of the new - generation research			1
on two separate occasions during the nine - month study , which is being funded by the @entity167 , patients are given a silver chalice containing either a psilocybin pill or a placebo			1
the patient then lies down on a brown sofa surrounded by artwork , sculptures of @entity184 , and , on a nearby bookshelf , a little glass mushroom with a red cap			0
for the next six hours , the patient listens , with eyes shaded , to a combination of classical , @entity192 , and tribal music			0
a pair of therapists -- who do n't know whether the patient has taken an active drug or placebo -- stay in the room for support , though they encourage the patient to remain in a meditative state			0
this may sound a bit trippy			0
but the science behind the research is sound , says @entity207 , @entity72 , a psychiatrist at the @entity209 , in @entity210 , and a member of the @entity167 's board of directors			0
according to @entity207 , who has conducted brain - imaging studies on the effects of psychedelics and @entity48 , these drugs appear to affect levels of serotonin and other chemicals in the body and brain that help regulate mood			1
@entity0 : could hallucinogenic drugs have healing properties ? when everything goes well , the drugs induce a " peaceful and blissful " state of unity with oneself and the cosmos , resulting in a new level of self - awareness and knowledge that can make an individual more responsive to cognitive therapy and other forms of psychotherapy , @entity207 says			1
( ironically , the drugs show promise in the treatment of alcohol addiction , he adds			1
) in cancer patients such as @entity1 , " these spiritually oriented altered states ... potentially allow patients to have an abrupt shift of consciousness from being scared about dying and feeling their life is over , " says @entity124			1
" it was quite remarkable to me to see changes in these people who were very anxious and in distress , and [ to ] see how they got better			1
" but it 's not always a smooth trip			0
depending on the dose , as well as an individual 's personality , the drugs can elicit fear , anxiety , paranoia , and , in some cases , a state akin to psychosis			1
" it 's not so easy -- it can be excruciatingly painful , " says @entity124			0
" those six hours that one is immersed in the experience can feel like the longest hours in a person 's life			0
" for this reason , the drugs should only be given in exact doses in a carefully controlled setting , researchers say			1
moreover , months of follow - up therapy are recommended to sort through the insights gleaned during the session and to ensure that they are applied productively to everyday life			2
a prescription for psilocybin ? the early results of the new research are promising			0
in the @entity48 study published in july , for instance , 10 of the 12 people who took the drug no longer met the criteria for post-traumatic stress two months later			1
and all five of the patients that have enrolled in @entity71 's study so far -- eventually it will include a few dozen -- have shown significant decreases in anxiety and depression			2
@entity0 : can @entity48 help ease post-traumatic stress ? " they 've all improved , " @entity71 says			1
" there appears to be something there			0
" researchers hope that if the ongoing preliminary studies prove the safety and effectiveness of these drugs for certain treatments , the government will step in to fund larger trials			1
@entity315 , @entity316 , the founder and president of @entity165 , says that this could happen in the next three years			0
but do n't expect to get a prescription for magic mushrooms from your psychiatrist any time soon			0
it will likely be a decade before the @entity140 approves a psychedelic as medicine , if it does so at all , says @entity315			2
the most likely candidate is mdma for post-traumatic stress , he adds			0
" what we 're trying to move towards is this legitimization of this field of psychedelic medicine , but we have to do it through the @entity140 , one drug at a time			2
" @entity335 , @entity72 , an addiction psychiatrist at the @entity337 , in @entity338 , and a former chair of the @entity341 's committee on addiction treatment , emphasizes that psychedelics are far from being a mainstream treatment			0
" this is a line of research that does have some data that show a potential for some positive outcomes , " he says			0
" but we are very , very far from recommending hallucinogens for the treatment of terminally ill patients			2
" still , the experiences of people like @entity1 hold out hope for people who have struggled to overcome depression and anxiety			2
@entity0 : 10 things to say ( and not say ) to someone with depression @entity1 's depression gradually lifted after her psilocybin session , which her husband credits with bringing about an " epiphany " and a " revival			0
" her depression and anxiety had prevented her from being active and enjoying life , but before long she and her husband were going to concerts again and hiking the north rim of the @entity374			0
meanwhile , @entity1 's cancer had continued to spread			0
on november 10 , 2006 , she died at home in her husband 's arms , just a few days after speaking at a fund - raiser for the @entity167 , which funded @entity124 's study			2
in a video on the institute 's website , @entity1 described the surge of emotion and newfound perspective that she experienced on psilocybin , and which had such an impact on the final years of her life			0
" i do n't think the drug is the cause of these things , " she said			0
" i think it 's a catalyst that allows you to release your own thoughts and feelings from some place [ where ] you 've bound them very tightly			0
