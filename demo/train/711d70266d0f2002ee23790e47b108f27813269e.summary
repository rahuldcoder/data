-- two days of testimony by a former partner of reputed mob boss @entity3 ended dramatically tuesday when @entity5 and @entity3 -- once so close that they spoke nearly every day for more than a decade -- shouted at one another across a federal courtroom in @entity8			1
@entity3 's lawyer , @entity9 , tried to portray weeks as an opportunist who knew how to manipulate the system , someone who cut a deal with prosecutors to serve just five years in prison for aiding and abetting five killings , several of which , @entity5 testified , he saw @entity3 commit			1
" you won against the system , " said @entity9			0
" what did i win ? what did i win , " @entity5 said , his voice sounding strained and tired			1
" five people are dead			0
" asked whether that bothered him , @entity5 shot back , " we killed people that were rats , and i had the two biggest rats right next to me ... " at that , @entity3 turned and hissed , " you suck			1
" " f --- you , ok , " snapped @entity32			1
" f --- you , too , " shouted @entity3 as the jury watched			1
" what do you want to do ? " said @entity5 , his eyes locked on @entity3 , who was flushed and staring right back			1
@entity40 marshals stood between the two men , and @entity40 district judge @entity42 instructed them both to follow the rules of the court before @entity5 was dismissed , his testimony over			1
@entity3 is charged in the deaths of 19 people during some two decades when prosecutors say he ran @entity8 's @entity50 mob			1
he also faces charges of extortion , racketeering and money laundering			0
why we ca n't get enough of the gangster life prosecutors spent most of the morning questioning weeks about killings he said he saw @entity3 commit			2
weeks recounted to the court graphic details of how @entity3 killed @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			2
in the summer of 1983 , @entity5 said @entity3 organized a meeting with @entity63 under the guise of having stolen diamonds that he needed to have taken off his hands			1
when @entity63 arrived at the house , @entity3 , his crime partner @entity70 and @entity5 were waiting			1
the group then chained @entity63 to a chair and grilled him for hours about a rival gang and local drug dealings , @entity5 said			2
@entity63 tried to buy his way out of being killed , describing to @entity3 where he had hidden $ 40,000 in cash			2
weeks said @entity3 left the house to pick up the cash while he and another associate watched @entity63			2
when @entity3 returned to the house , he instructed @entity63 to walk down to the basement			2
then @entity3 put the gun to the back of @entity63 's head , pulled the trigger , and according to @entity5 , " nothing happened			1
" when @entity3 realized that the gun 's safety was still on , he removed it and shot @entity63			2
weeks said he also saw @entity3 shoot @entity94 in the same house where he killed @entity63			2
his methods were the same , too -- he chained @entity94 to a chair , where he admitted to letting authorities capture a boat carrying 40 tons of marijuana slated for sale by @entity3 and his gang			2
" @entity105 took out a rope and started strangling @entity94 ; it was too thick , it just gagged him and then @entity105 asked the victim , ' do you want one to the head ? ' " @entity32 said			0
@entity94 said , " yes sir , " and @entity3 shot him five times			0
@entity5 said he also witnessed the killing of @entity65 in that same home			0
on a day in early 1985 , @entity5 said he came downstairs after hearing a " thud " and saw @entity3 strangling @entity65 , whose lips turned blue as her eyes rolled back into her head			1
after each of the three slayings , @entity70 prepared the bodies to be buried by removing the victims ' teeth			0
this practice earned him the nickname " dr. @entity128 , " after the infamous @entity127 physician , @entity5 said			0
the victims were buried in the basement of the house only to be moved to another makeshift grave because the owners of the house were selling it			0
" it was cheaper to move the bodies than buy house , " @entity5 explained			0
most of the cross-examination focused on weeks ' decision to testify against his former crime partners , including @entity3 , @entity143 and rogue @entity145 agent @entity144			1
@entity5 acknowledged that @entity3 hated informants , explaining @entity8 's code as : " you never give up your friends			1
you never rat on your enemies			0
you take care of your own business			0
" at times @entity5 seemed apologetic , saying he had hoped @entity3 would never be caught " so he would n't be in the circus we 're in			1
" after escaping a 1995 indictment , allegedly on a tip from a rogue @entity145 agent , @entity3 went into hiding for 16 years , landing himself on the @entity145 's most wanted list before being arrested with his girlfriend in @entity161 , @entity162 , in 2011			0
however , @entity5 defended his actions , saying he had been shown @entity3 's informant file by fellow @entity165 , or " @entity8 , " and disgraced @entity145 agent @entity144 and that , " you ca n't rat on a rat			1
" he says no one has given him any trouble since he returned to @entity8 , not even the @entity172 mafia , which allegedly continues to operate			0
in ' @entity175 's gang , death was way of life when @entity3 's lawyer suggested @entity5 had lied at times , @entity5 shot back almost in disbelief : " i 've been lying my whole life			1
" but he clarified that his lies were confined to smaller matters , not the testimony he has provided at nearly five trials			0
@entity9 asked , " what lies do you tell your wife ? " " i 'm not cheating , " said @entity5 by way of explanation			0
" does she know you 're lying ? " asked @entity9			0
" we 're divorced , " @entity5 responded .			0
