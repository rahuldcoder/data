@entity0 -- at a gathering of his safety - minded peers , @entity2 had a confession to make			1
last month , while driving to @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity2 glanced down to review a playlist on his car 's mp3 player			2
he scrolled through the titles , looking for @entity13 songs , " wanting to avoid the @entity15 songs that my wife had put there			2
" then @entity2 looked up ... and continued driving			2
unremarkable ? @entity2 does n't think so			0
@entity2 , an expert at human - machine interactions at the @entity23 , had just co-authored a paper titled " scrolling while driving			1
" and despite his own heightened awareness about the dangers of distracted driving , he had spent three to five seconds with his eyes off the road , a time lapse that placed him well into the danger zone			1
the incident , he said , demonstrated the insidious creep of distracting technology into the automobile			1
" it seems like the old technology , " he said of his car 's audio system			0
" it seems like a radio			0
" and if @entity2 -- who has forsworn cell phone and text messaging in his car -- can be lulled into a distracting experience , anybody can , he said			1
" i 've been very well - trained to the dangers of distraction , and yet i 'm vulnerable , " he said			1
@entity2 's anecdote at a @entity53 all - day forum tuesday hit upon two themes -- the invasion of pernicious technology in automobiles and the precious few seconds it takes to go from an attentive driver to a distracted one			1
@entity2 and a panel of experts said that any distraction of two seconds or longer significantly increases the likelihood of a crash			1
novice drivers are 16 times more likely to take a dangerous glance inside the vehicle than experienced drivers , the experts said , citing one study			1
and the risk of a crash increases " four-fold " if a driver was on the phone , regardless of whether they were using a hand - held or a hands - free device , they said			1
some agreement ; some dispute the forum comes at a time when the @entity53 and the @entity82 are at odds over just how far the government should go to restrict digital devices in cars			1
the @entity82 is recommending that states ban the use of handheld cell phones and text messaging devices			1
but the @entity53 wants to take it a step further , banning the use of hands - free devices , except those that aid driving			1
" things that are hands - free are distracting too , " said @entity53 chairman @entity97			1
" we 'd like to see requirements and standards that look at all distractions , not just the manipulative or the visual distractions , but recognizing that there 's a cognitive distraction , " she said			1
experts call it " looking but not seeing			2
" " the issue of cognitive distraction seems to have been left off the table -- forgotten a little bit , " she said			2
distractions everywhere driver distractions are hardly new , safety board members and panels acknowledged			0
everything from billboards , to beautiful scenery , to pretty girls , have distracted drivers since the advent of automobiles , they said			0
but new texting technology creates a " perfect storm " of activities that create danger , prompting users to look and engage			0
in addition to taking a driver 's eyes off the road and hands off the wheel , texting devices can engage people 's minds so that they 're paying less attention to the task of driving , the experts said			1
and the technology is evolving faster than its impact can be appreciated , @entity2 said			0
" the pace of change is daunting			0
the pace of change far outstrips the pace of regulatory response , " he explained			0
an often - quoted study on distracted driving known as the " 100 car study " was conducted in 2003 and 2004 -- before the introduction of @entity155 ( 2004 ) , @entity148 ( 2006 ) , the @entity149 ( 2007 ) , and @entity149 apps ( 2008 ) , @entity2 said			2
driver distraction is a growing contributor to @entity159 traffic fatalities , said @entity160 of the @entity161			2
in 1999 , there were 4,563 distracted driving fatalities , accounting for 10.9 % of all fatalities			0
in 2008 , there were 5,870 distraction fatalities , 15.8 % of the total			2
but police reports are not a reliable source of information for the cause of distracted driving accidents , said @entity173 of the @entity174			0
the cause of accidents is frequently not reported , and there are very large differences across the states , @entity173 said			0
the best studies , she said , used phone records to determine if drivers were possibly distracted at the time of a crash , she said			0
cell phones vs. conversations cell phones are more distracting than conversing with passengers , said @entity189 of the @entity190			1
a passenger is " an extra set of eyes , " and can moderate their conversation during challenging driving periods , unlike a person on a phone , @entity189 said			0
they can serve as a collision avoidance system , " pointing out hazards and screaming in the extreme case , " said @entity2			0
passengers can be distracting too , said @entity160			1
some modulate conversations ; some do n't , he said			0
but for all the study on distracting driving , a lot is still unknown , the experts said			1
experts , for example , do n't know to what extent drivers self - regulate , confining dialing and texting to less dangerous times , such as at stop lights			1
and they do n't know whether people who choose to buy hands - free devices differ from those who use hand - held devices , and how that may impact test results			1
but experts at the @entity53 forum say distractions of two seconds or more appear to divide safe driving from dangerous driving			1
the challenge , they said , was getting drivers to understand just how fleeting two seconds is			2
fighting fire with fire the experts say the solution to technological distraction may be technology itself			1
already , smart phones have applications that can regulate use , restricting the use of cell phones or texting services while the device is moving , for instance			1
industry has become a major force , using dashboard cameras to keep tabs on fleet drivers			0
increasingly , new cars are equipped with collision warning systems			2
and those systems are becoming more sophisticated			0
at the @entity256 's @entity255 , scientists have tested a seat belt that tightens to warn the driver of a possible crash			0
" what we 've learned is that auditory displays can be a nuisance , " said @entity260 , of the @entity255 lab. " they are annoying			0
they alert other passengers that something is going on and that 's embarrassing to the driver			2
" however , a seatbelt that tightens , a vibrating seat or a pulsing brake are " very driver - centric			2
" " the driver can say , ' oops , something 's going on here ' and sort of reorient their attention			0
" back to those play lists in @entity2 's study , 50 people searched for songs on playlists of varying lengths using either an mp3 player or an aftermarket controller while driving on a simulator			0
the results : searching through long playlists containing 580 songs resulted in poor driving performance and required long glances of two seconds or more			2
" drivers did not adequately adapt their behavior to roadway demand , as evident in their degraded driving performance , " his study concludes			0
@entity2 says he now knows that from scientific research and from personal experience			0
@entity1 's @entity302 contributed to this report .			0

experts say a distraction of more than 2 seconds is dangerous
the @entity53 wants to ban use of hands - free devices in cars
cell phones are more distracting than talking to passengers , experts say
