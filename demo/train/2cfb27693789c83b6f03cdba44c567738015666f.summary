@entity0 -- the closed shops and empty streets that once gave @entity0 the feel of a ghost town teemed with life again saturday as a cold morning rain stirred residents to grumble about a more familiar @entity10 grievance : the weather			1
yet for many across the region , monday 's marathon attacks and a terrorist manhunt spurred changes more subtle and difficult to quantify than those wrought by the deadly force of two bombs that detonated near the finish line			1
the manhunt spanned @entity0 and its surrounding suburbs , riveting the nation and deepening concerns about the origins of the attack and the likelihood of another			2
" i think i understand a little better how people feel in other countries that go through this , " said @entity29 , 39 , who had huddled in her @entity31 apartment as authorities combed the area in search of the suspected bomber			1
" we were just so paranoid			2
" ' a million questions ' for bombing suspect others said the experience offered a rare front - row seat to a phenomenon unfamiliar to most @entity47 cities , tested their faith or simply reminded them of life 's fragility			1
" never have i seen anything like this , " said @entity31 resident @entity51 , as businesses shuttered and streets closed , leaving many to wonder how long the manhunt would drag on			1
" it makes you wonder how safe we all are			1
" @entity60 also seemed cautious , even after police made an arrest , despite hundreds of college - aged revelers who poured out of their homes friday evening when the lockdown expired			2
" there 's always this thing in the back of my head that wonders if all of this is a little premature , " she said			2
for @entity74 , the experience of crouching in his bathtub with his wife , @entity77 , as bullets whizzed through his @entity31 home left him tired and still shaken a day later			1
" there 's no real going back to normal after something like this , " he said			2
" it feels today like we 're waking up from a nightmare			1
" as @entity0 reeled , younger suspect partied as the overnight shoot - out unfolded between police and suspected terrorists , the couple had been directly in the line of fire			2
" i knew that i could n't protect her , " he said			1
" there was nothing i could do			0
" when it was all over , shell casings littered his front yard and seven bullet holes were scattered across his home , including one in his living room that left his television shattered			0
at least one other round pierced the walls of his neighbor 's home and blasted harmlessly into their children 's bedroom			0
" it 's terrifying to hear about something like that , " @entity74 added , saying the shootings had forced things into perspective			0
" in the midst of feeling really safe , there was this reality yesterday that we could die from bullets and explosions in our @entity47 home , " he said			1
" that 's not something you 'd expect			0
" on saturday , as life returned to normal , local bars and coffee shops in @entity0 were abuzz with talk more reflective of the nature of the attacks than the specific ways in which the teenager had initially evaded authorities			1
@entity137 began with intense firefight in dark street " we 're all still in shock , " said @entity140 , a local resident who had watched friday as traffic trickled through @entity0 's normally bustling downtown streets			1
" this type of thing just does n't happen here			1
" the violence has left many grappling without answers , which president @entity149 echoed in a hastily arranged address to the nation on friday night			0
" why did these young men who grew up and studied here as part of our communities and our country resort to such violence ? " the president said			0
" how did they plan and carry out these attacks ? and did they receive any help ? the families of those killed so senselessly deserve answers			0
" by saturday afternoon , security across @entity0 remained tight			0
checkpoints were still visible in parts of the city , as were flower memorials set up near the marathon finish line , where three people suffered fatal wounds and more than 170 were injured			0
but at @entity181 , in an attempt to regain a sense of normalcy , more than 35,000 @entity177 fans bellowed out the lyrics to their eighth - inning signature tune , " @entity180 , " led personally in a surprise appearance by @entity183			0
" i bring love from the whole country , " the 72 - year - old singer told the crowd , drawing raucous cheers			0
the @entity177 then rallied to beat the @entity189 after trailing 2 - 1 in the top of the eighth			0
suspects : immigrant dream to @entity47 nightmare			0

@entity31 residents say after dodging bullets , life wo n't be the same
" it makes you wonder how safe we all are , " @entity31 resident says
says another : " we 're all still in shock "
