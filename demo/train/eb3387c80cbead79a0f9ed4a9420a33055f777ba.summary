-- when does a cult become a religion ? when the cult leader dies			0
only then do @entity8 's @entity7 practitioners become the religion of @entity10 , the followers of @entity5 become full - fledged @entity11 , or -- by the same logic -- a few anti-establishment apostles become @entity14			0
what then of the cult of @entity17 after the death of its own leader , @entity19 ? i like @entity17 products as much as any user , and respect the contributions that @entity17 under @entity19 ' leadership made to the co-evolution of human beings and their technologies			1
but all along i have also been aware of the closed nature of @entity17 technologies , as well as the leap of faith that has been required to accept @entity19 ' promise that doing things in some new way will be " fantastic			1
" without @entity19 telling us to cross the chasm , will we continue to embrace each of @entity17 's future revolutions in hardware , software or both ? for most of us , particularly those of us who want to know as little as possible about technology in order to use it , @entity17 has been a perfect answer			1
as members of the first generation of a digital society -- digital immigrants , if you will -- we could not relate to computers and software directly			1
@entity19 found and employed interfaces that quite literally translated the directories and sub-directories of computers to the files and folders of a desktop			1
he promoted real world metaphors for otherwise obscure processes , making the immense power of computers accessible to many of us much sooner and more completely than we would have achieved without him			0
and moving on from there , he and his teams liberated digital music files with @entity67 and the @entity68 , and popularized the smartphone with the @entity70			0
at each step , however , we consumers and users had to make certain compromises			1
some of them we know about , and others most of us are much less aware of , at least right now			0
back when @entity19 returned to @entity17 and came out with the @entity79 , many users were aghast at being asked to purchase a computer with no floppy drive ! sure , @entity19 saw the writing on the wall ( or felt confident enough to scribble it up there himself ) , and decided for us that floppy drives were obsolete			1
if you can burn cds , why mess with floppies ? besides , internet speeds were starting to increase and it was just a matter of time before people exchanged files by e-mail instead of handing and mailing physical disks to one another			0
but to take this leap required a bit of faith from consumers			0
it was a level of faith that i suspect only a leader as charismatic as @entity19 could elicit from us			1
time after time , @entity19 told us to trust him , and time after time we did			1
no serial port ? no firewire ? no flash ? no keyboard ? just trust @entity19 , he has a vision for how this is all going to work out			1
meanwhile , all along the way , we were also being asked to surrender a certain degree of authority over our own devices			0
part of the reason @entity17 products work so well is that they are closed to our intervention			1
unlike @entity126 's , early @entity17 products only worked with @entity17 - made peripherals			1
that 's why @entity17 machines never ( or very rarely ) had conflicts or crashes			1
they were n't trying to accommodate everybody else 's printers and modems and drivers			0
likewise , @entity137 are closed systems			0
unless we " jailbreak " our phones , software and content must be purchased from @entity17			2
the @entity70 's capabilities are similarly limited to activities that @entity17 deems appropriate and profitable for itself and its partners			2
as beginning users , which most of us are , these are compromises we do n't really care too much about			2
who wanted to do something with his phone that @entity19 said was unnecessary , anyway ? but as we get increasingly comfortable with computers and networking , we may start to want to have more of a say in the way we use our devices and for what purposes			1
just like @entity161 subscribers who finally decided they could leave the wading pool and swim out to the real @entity163 , @entity17 users might eventually trust themselves to make their own decisions about what constitutes the appropriate use of a computer or smartphone			1
at the very least , our willingness to trust @entity19 may be compromised by the fact that he is gone			2
without him telling us to take a counterintuitive leap with him into the future equivalent of @entity67 , tablets or gesture - based displays , will we go ? until now , the strangeness , learning curve and doubt have been assuaged by the voice of @entity19 himself			1
from here on , we 'll have to believe that this is what @entity19 would have meant for us			2
the struggle to divine the will of @entity19 has already begun			2
plans for a future @entity17 tv are already rumored to be a secret @entity188 project			1
and the next few iterations of the @entity191 and @entity70 operating systems , as well as whatever will one day replace them , will no doubt be credited to plans and conversations with @entity19 before his death			2
the bigger an adjustment any new @entity17 technology requires of us , the more heavily it will be touted as the will of @entity19			1
once the last secret plans penned by @entity19 himself are revealed , it will be up to his innermost circle to claim they now speak for @entity19 , that they really do know what it is he meant and meant for us			2
some will argue that he meant for @entity17 to become a content delivery system that secured the financial interests of creators			2
others will claim he meant for technology to be free			0
still others will see @entity19 guiding @entity17 technologies from production to consumption in order to stave off the content glut and create a market for professionals			1
meanwhile , those who lose internal @entity17 battles will spin off their own companies , convinced they are the true lineage of @entity19			1
yes , very big corporations have survived after the departure of their founding visionaries			0
as many have argued , @entity227 managed to do pretty well after the departure of @entity227			0
but @entity227 is a content company			0
like the founders of the most successful religions , @entity227 left behind a mythology that stood in his place : @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238			0
@entity227 is embodied by this bible of stories			0
operating systems and technologies are not content , and they do n't live on in the same way as foundational myths			0
one device or system is simply replaced by another , which creates discontinuity , fear and confusion			0
great technology ideas require us to change the way we actually do things			0
without @entity19 to confirm the insane greatness of such changes , it will be up to us to judge whether a given innovation really is in the spirit of @entity19			2
and i 'm not sure @entity17 can afford for us to stop and think before rushing to line up outside the @entity262 for the next sacrament			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity266 .			0

@entity266 : now that @entity19 is dead , will cult of @entity17 endure ?
he says @entity19 guided many into digital society with user - *friendly* computers
he says @entity19 told users what they did and did n't need ; they trusted his judgment
@entity266 : as consumers rely on their own judgment , not @entity188 ' , will they stay with @entity17 ?
