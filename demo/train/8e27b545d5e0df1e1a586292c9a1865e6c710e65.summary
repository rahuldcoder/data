many of our immediate responses to @entity3 were successful			1
scientists accurately forecast the storm ; authorities ordered the proper actions ; many people heeded the orders ; and there was a massive government response in the aftermath			2
what went most wrong , and continues to go wrong , is our handling of environmental risks in the long term			1
even when the present has delivered an unprecedented shock , we still have trouble accepting that the future will bring new ones , unlike those before			0
@entity3 was forecast with remarkable precision			1
some models saw the storm coming more than a week ahead of time			0
five days before it made landfall , the @entity28 predicted the rest of the storm 's track confidently , and almost perfectly			0
forecasts this accurate are the result of decades of research and development , much of it done by government - funded scientists and engineers			1
their remarkable achievement should not be taken for granted			0
many aspects of the immediate government response to @entity3 were also successful			1
having learned from his predecessor 's failure with @entity49 in 2005 , president @entity46 took @entity3 seriously from the outset			1
a battered community , an unexpected angel the @entity53 had people and assets in place early , and mobilized reinforcements quickly after the storm to bring help to those in need			1
there were many successes at the local level as well			0
@entity66 's @entity65 did a remarkable job restoring subway service so quickly			1
our real problems are long - term			1
our infrastructure is not prepared for the climate we 've had in the past , let alone the one we 'll have in the future			2
it was clear for years that the @entity66 subways were dangerously vulnerable to hurricane flooding			2
it was considered too expensive a response to a problem that would arrive at an unspecified future time			0
one of the storm 's most expensive casualties was the new , half - billion dollar station at @entity85 , built in the flood zone			2
this is not to single out the @entity65			1
similar examples line our coastline -- houses and businesses built on the beach and in coastal wetlands , power lines vulnerable to trees that come down even in tropical storm - force winds			2
the consequences of poor planning will become all the more serious as climate warms and sea level rises			2
@entity103 : photographer revisits @entity3 's path @entity66 is actually a world leader in urban environmentalism			1
mayor @entity108 and @entity110 's @entity109 , more resilient @entity66 " may be the most serious proposal by any city yet to become more climate - ready			1
i hope that it survives the end of @entity108 's term , and that we find the funds and political will to implement it , or something like it			2
but political and economic pressures discourage long - term investment			1
this is more true at the federal level than the local , and becomes still more frightening when we consider the most large - scale and long - term problem : human - induced global warming itself			1
floods like @entity3 's will become more common as sea level rises			1
rain - driven floods like those in @entity136 a few weeks ago will also happen more often , as warmer air holds more water vapor			2
less dramatic , but perhaps ultimately more harmful , the coolest summers in a hundred years will be hotter than even the hottest summers that have occurred in our lifetimes			0
this has still not sunk in			0
it is outside our experience , and hard to grasp			0
but we know these things will happen			0
this , too , is a confident forecast			0
the changes are already under way , results of human greenhouse gas emissions , and consistent with the predictions of climate scientists decades ago			2
reducing greenhouse gas emissions takes long - term vision			1
it also takes faith in science			0
@entity162 , at its heart , is just the practice of taking reality seriously			0
under @entity46 , the @entity165 has taken some modest measures			0
but we need to do much more			0
so far , the long - term costs of inaction have not been taken as seriously as the short - term costs of action			1
most disturbing , the primary tactic of those opposed to action has not been to argue about the real costs and benefits , but to pretend that reality is not what it is			0
we human beings are all a little shortsighted by nature , but there is no excuse for willful ignorance , or for conscious , intellectually dishonest denial			0
when science delivers a threatening forecast , action is the only responsible course			0
our leaders have shown great capacity to act upon a forecast for a superstorm in a few days ' time			0
we need to convince them to take the climate change forecast equally seriously .			1

@entity197 : the short - term responses to @entity3 were successful
forecasts were very accurate , @entity53 and @entity65 responded *effectively* , he says
@entity197 says the one failure was that it has *n't* *prompted* *sufficient* concern about climate change
threat of storms , flooding will *increase* ; cities need to prepare now , @entity197 says
