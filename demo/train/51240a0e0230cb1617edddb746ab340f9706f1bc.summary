-- @entity1 woke up angry the first time she dreamed of herself as an amputee			1
she 'd found a certain measure of comfort in late - night reunions with her two - legged self , but for the first time since her surgery , the reality of her altered body seeped into her sleeping hours			2
she felt cheated , took a moment to mourn , and went about the business of her day			2
living with limb loss requires a certain toughness			2
the graphic images and accounts from the @entity19 have thrown the issue of amputation into the national spotlight			2
as tragic and violent as the circumstances of their injuries were , the 14 people who lost arms , legs , hands or feet as a result of the attack represent a fraction of who undergo amputation in the @entity34 on any given day -- roughly 500 people , according to figures from the @entity37 , the nation 's largest limb loss advocacy and support group			1
it is @entity1 's mission to let every person who has lost a limb know they are not alone			1
through her blog , the tales of an @entity47 , the 38 - year - old writer and social media manager receives 10 to 20 e-mails a day from people newly dealing with limb difference , and feeling severed from the world as well			1
by 2011 , @entity1 had been dealing with her own limb loss for nearly eight years			2
what started as an accident at a work conference -- a computer monitor falling off a cart and crushing her foot -- spiraled into a five - year nightmare of excruciating pain , endless and ineffective surgeries and finally a legal battle to win the right to the amputation that would finally end the physical part of her suffering			2
( her insurance company contended that she could live a " happy , healthy and active lifestyle on narcotics and crutches			2
) frustrated that she rarely saw people like herself outside the confines of her prosthetist 's office , @entity1 declared the last saturday of that april , which is @entity79 , to be " @entity80			1
" in a blog entry titled " starting a movement , " she encouraged her readers to forgo cosmetic coverings , wear shorts and other clothes that reveal prosthetics and residual limbs and " bring the amputee community out of the shadows			1
" it hit a nerve			2
now in its third year , @entity1 's movement has been adopted by the @entity37 and retooled as " @entity94 , " with public outings and awareness events planned around the country for saturday			1
there is also a @entity100 contest for people to share pictures of themselves in public with the absence of their limbs evident			1
winners , determined by number of @entity100 " likes " in four categories ( individual , family and friends and community , support groups and facilities , or workplace ) will receive recognition in several of the organization 's publications			1
for each photo uploaded to the page during april , prosthetic limb maker @entity120 will donate $ 1 to the coalition			0
the feedback @entity1 has received steels her belief that this exposure , however uncomfortable it might be for both participants and onlookers , is a force for forward motion			0
" i was astounded that so many people are n't living their lives out of fear of what other people are going to think , " she says			1
" this event gives people a reason to stand up and say , ' this is who i am			1
' not every amputee uses a prosthetic , but every amputee in their own right has shown that they 're strong and they have gumption and courage to persevere			1
that 's the definition of ( showing ) your mettle			0
" the journey toward public exposure can be terrifying , but both experts and members of the community agree on its importance in the process of seeing one 's self as whole again			1
" people are afraid of what they do n't know , " says @entity163			1
the 41 - year - old registered dietitian lost her leg ( and the family dog ) four years ago in a car accident 90 miles from her home in @entity171			1
@entity163 vividly recalls her first public outing , picking up her children at day care , before she received her prothesis			0
" i remember walking into my children 's classroom and all the little kids tilting their heads sideways , like they were looking for the rest of my leg , " she says			0
" the looks on their faces were priceless			0
it was such a sweet moment , explaining to a group of 3 - and 4 - year - olds what happened to my leg			0
but somehow , explaining it to those innocent little kids was kind of healing			0
" @entity163 also said goodbye to an emblem of her former self in the form of a " shoe funeral			0
" no longer able to wear shoes with a heel higher than two inches , she had to get rid of 40 pairs of shoes and adapt her signature style to work with her new prosthetic -- a " realistic " model that cost her $ 20,000			0
for her , the price was worth it			0
" i do n't see it as being ashamed of my leg , " she says			1
" for me it 's just a matter of feeling more whole and beautiful			0
we all dress or style our hair a certain way as an expression of ourselves , and i felt a part of that was taken from me			0
" while she does n't always care to draw attention to her prosthetic , @entity163 does always make sure the socket that fits around her residual limb has a bit of fun or sparkle to it			1
it 's part of the process of embracing her changed physical self			0
over the past two years , @entity80 has inspired people to go out in their community for the first time without a cosmetic cover , reveal to co-workers that they 're living with a prosthetic , or even leave the confines of their own homes , which they had n't done since their limb loss			1
@entity1 designed an awareness ribbon that incorporates the image of a prosthetic leg , and last year received a large order for merchandise			0
a boy was about to return home from having his leg amputated , and his soccer team wanted to rally around him on @entity241 with the ribbon emblazoned on their jerseys			0
" that 's what it 's about , " @entity1 says , " getting the community 's support , raising awareness and letting people know that you can be missing a limb and still be very whole and live a fulfilling life			1
" @entity1 says that , like most amputees , she still has " bad leg days			1
" but she says the acceptance of her limb loss came about without fanfare one day when she realized what she had been missing			0
" i knew i was going to be ok when i got through my lunch and i realized i had n't cursed out my prosthetic yet			1
" artificial limbs push boundaries of art going out to strut your stuff ? dr. @entity268 is a psychologist who specializes in dealing with limb difference			1
( she lost her arm below the elbow in a car accident and opts not to wear a prosthetic			1
) here are some of her tips for situations your might encounter , both from friends and loved ones			0
if people stare at you , look back and smile			1
it is part of human nature to be curious , and they do n't necessarily mean anything by it			1
if you do get positive feedback , put that in your self esteem bank for later when you might be having a difficult time			0
do not define yourself by your lost limb			1
if people have a negative reaction , it is not personal toward you			2
it is natural to feel repulsed upon first seeing the absence of a limb , even when it 's a loved one or romantic partner			0
neither one of you should feel ashamed by this , and know that it does pass			0
there are tremendous resources available on the @entity37 website			0
educate yourself as much as possible , so you can be open to discussion if it arises			0
see someone showing their mettle ? @entity1 has some advice for those who may have questions for people with limb loss			2
if a person seems open to questions , you may ask them politely			0
otherwise , just leave them alone			0
do n't conduct the @entity321			2
let the person share whatever they 're comfortable with , but do n't press			2
not everyone is at the same place in their journey , and they do n't owe you a story			2
for goodness ' sakes , do n't make fun			2
within the community , a good sense of humor is necessary for survival and we 'll make plenty of jokes -- but that does n't mean you are free to as well			1
do n't tell them what they " should " be doing			2
yes , @entity344 has those cool sport legs			0
the most basic prosthetics are almost a luxury item for most people and often are n't covered by insurance			1
are you or someone you love dealing with limb loss ? we would love to hear from you			0
please share your story in the comments below ; we 're paying close attention			0
