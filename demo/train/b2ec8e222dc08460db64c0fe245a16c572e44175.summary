-- going into monday night 's @entity0 / @entity2 , the anticipation was that the two frontrunners -- @entity5 gov. @entity4 and former @entity7 gov. @entity6 -- would continue their argument over who created more jobs or whose position on @entity12 was more electable			1
but early on it became clear that @entity4 , who holds a double - digit lead over all of his rivals , would be everyone 's target and one - time frontrunner @entity6 tried to bring @entity4 back closer to the pack and his other rivals tried to score points at the governor 's expense			1
here 's how @entity0 's analysts and contributors saw the debate : who scored and who did n't ? @entity29 , @entity0 contributor and conservative talk show host : i think the overall standout , @entity6 and @entity4 really went at each other , they shot each other in each other 's foot			1
i think [ @entity41 rep. @entity40 ] @entity39 ultimately had some of the most solid answers of the night			1
if she expected to stay in or be in the top tier of candidates in this primary , she needed to be aggressive , hard - hitting and go after other candidates			2
that 's what she did			2
" overall , i would give it to @entity39			1
[ @entity52 ] @entity51 always does well , but he 's been doing it for an incredibly long time			0
in terms of jobs , whenever @entity55 spoke , every single time he spoke , he backed it up with a plan that he 's already published on his website			0
@entity69 , @entity0 contributor and @entity72 strategist : " this is , in fact , i think long - term , strategically , the real achilles heel for governor @entity4 , that is where @entity39 took it -- she took it to ' crony capitalism			1
' she 's trying to suggest that @entity4 will depart from conservative values if there is money to be made for lobbyists			1
if this notion begins to take hold that @entity4 might sell out those conservative principles because he 's connected to a lobbyist , then mrs. @entity39 may get back into the race , mr. @entity6 may start to press this			1
when i talk to people in @entity5 , they think his achilles heel is cronyism and pay to play			0
@entity6 vs @entity4 @entity87 , @entity0 senior political analyst : " there 's no question that @entity6 and @entity4 will remain the frontrunners @entity6 has a better command of the facts			1
he 's a more practiced debater			0
he gave one of the best answers of his entire campaign when he was asked how he would balance the budget			0
but @entity4 has the command presence , and even though people took shots at him as you said , he deflected reasonably well , he came in as a better debater , he was more even this time			1
" he talks a lot of @entity5			0
he 's going to need to move beyond @entity5			0
he 's clearly going to have to beef himself up on the international side			0
i would have to tell you , @entity4 walked in here as a frontrunner tonight			1
and i imagine he walked out as the frontrunner			0
@entity110 , @entity0 contributor and @entity113 blogger : " i think this may be the first debate where @entity6 did n't come out the clear winner			1
@entity4 needed to do well			1
i think he did well			0
i do n't think the social security exchange helps @entity6 at all at a @entity119 primary			1
he 's foolish to continue , and he may want to go after @entity120 on immigration or @entity122			0
i think the majority of @entity119 voters agree with @entity4			1
for the life of me , i ca n't understand why @entity6 would go with this			1
[ @entity40 ] @entity127 was going to make this a key point and backed down from this			0
" @entity131 , @entity0 chief political analyst : " i think that @entity6 started chipping away at the economic miracle of the state of @entity5			1
and it 's clear he 's going to continue to go back at that			0
he said , you know , when you 're dealt four aces , it 's easy to win the hand			0
and i remember that happening with [ 1988 @entity72 presidential candidate ] @entity143 , talking about the " @entity144			0
' they started chipping away at that , it was a big problem for him			0
" on the ideological battle within the @entity119 @entity69 , @entity0 contributor and @entity72 strategist : @entity6 was cool , @entity4 was hot			1
@entity6 was factual and @entity4 was a little more emotional			1
it was really an interesting study in contrast			0
the real question is , which party ? not who won , but which party ? if this is still the party of investment bankers who carry a putter at the country club , then @entity6 wins			1
if it 's people carrying a pitchfork to a tea party rally , @entity4 wins			2
in the hall it sure sounded from the audience , a strikingly conservative , almost radically conservative audience which helps @entity4			2
@entity175 , @entity0 contributor and former president @entity178 press secretary : " @entity4 's gamble is that the @entity41 people want to push for greater change in entitlement programs , that they 're ready for something fundamental			1
@entity6 's gamble is that they do n't want to do anything bigger fundamental , they really just want an expert to go in and change things around the edges and make some smart reforms			2
" who is going to be ascendant ? will it be the tea party movement to change @entity189 or the more conventional traditional @entity119 -- keep what 's there , make it a little better , a little more cost - efficient			2
this is the dynamic in play right now			0
" @entity131 : " i think what you 're seeing is this fight within the @entity119 , i could n't help but watch the debate and you saw @entity201 and @entity6 , they looked like the old - time , establishment @entity119 candidates struggling to kind of say , ' ok , this is the way we 're going to take the party			1
' @entity6 , it 's his turn to be nominated , he ran last time			2
" and then you saw the other candidates , they 're saying , ' wait a minute , wait a minute , we 're not going to go along with you			0
' and then you saw @entity4 , essentially trying to walk both sides of that , saying , ' you know what , yes , we passed the @entity217 in my state			2
yes , i ordered this vaccine for young women , ' something that @entity165 folks do not like , conservative @entity119 do n't like			2
" trying to walk both sides of that , and come across as somebody who can appeal to independent voters while also appealing to tea party @entity119			2
that 's very difficult , but that 's what i think we saw @entity4 try to do , and we 're going to continue to see him try to do that as he has to look at the general election			1
" on how this will play out into the general election @entity175 : " i think that @entity119 have to be careful here that @entity12 does not become the defining issue that divides them in this primary			1
they have to remember in these debates to bring it back to @entity241 , to jobs , to debt and deficits			0
this is the core strength that have made @entity119 so strong in this cycle			2
the bigger perspective can not be lost as these debates continue			0
" @entity250 , @entity0 contributor : " if you 're a @entity254 voter , the last thing you wanted to hear was some of the stuff you heard tonight			0
@entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 will be critical states when it comes to november 2012			0
the @entity119 did themselves no favors tonight with @entity254 voters			2
" education did not come up in this debate at all			2
the only moment it came up was about abolishing the @entity268			0
if you 're a parent trying to get your kid educated , not a single candidate offered anything to speak to the crisis we have in this country when it comes to education			0

@entity6 and @entity4 entered as frontrunners and left as frontrunners , said @entity87
@entity29 : @entity39 was aggressive against *opponents* , improved her standing
debate demonstrated the ideological battle within @entity119 , said @entity69
@entity175 : @entity290 scored points with conservatives but raised questions about general election
