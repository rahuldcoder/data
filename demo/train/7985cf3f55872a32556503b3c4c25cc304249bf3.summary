there is a saying that @entity2 are born on horses			2
" that 's how important these animals are to our culture , " says @entity4 , as he smooths his leathery palms over a 200 - year - old saddle			2
his collection of more than 400 @entity13 horse saddles has been a labor of love since he stopped riding			0
after more than 40 years of training and riding horses , the ethnic @entity2 says they 're as much a part of him as the air he breathes			1
" as a kid , everyone rode horses to herd sheep , but now we only see motorcycles " the 68 - year old says , as he lights a cigarette			0
he reveals a toothy smile that carves even deeper wrinkles into his weathered skin			0
" we learned to ride when we could walk			0
" @entity4 , who like most @entity2 goes by one name , has witnessed many changes around the street where he runs an antiques shop			0
this was once a trading area for livestock in downtown @entity40 , capital of @entity42 's @entity41			1
unfortunately the most significant -- and damaging -- change is taking place on lands beyond the city that most @entity2 traditionally lived on			0
overgrazing and drought have combined to threaten @entity41 's grasslands			1
desertification in the @entity52 grasslands , some 120 miles from @entity40 , has forced the government to place restrictions on some herders			2
but ethnic @entity2 complain their nomadic lifestyle is being threatened			1
though some have been handed government subsidies , others have reported being forced to move from grasslands into brick apartments in cities like @entity40			1
the nomadic way of life dates back to the days of @entity65 , leader of one of the largest empires in history that stretched from the @entity69 to @entity70			0
grazing cattle , sheep and horses on the @entity13 steppe while living in circular white tents known as gers was the traditional way of life for many			2
@entity79 is one of a decreasing number of herders still living off his family 's land , which has been passed down three generations			0
he says he 's content doing what his father and their ancestors have passed down and has no plans to move			0
" we @entity2 used to have a big population here , but now our numbers are getting smaller and smaller , " the 41 - year old says			2
he has 400 sheep and goats , and sells them for about 1,000 yuan ( us $ 160 ) each , making a decent living for his family			0
but not all ethnic @entity2 in the region are as content			2
the threat to traditional @entity13 culture , which includes allegations of illegal land seizures , has led to an uptick in protests in recent years			1
according to the @entity107 - based @entity106 , repeated appeals have been made to the government to protect the nomadic culture from activities such as mining in this resource - rich country			2
the group said at least 22 ethnic @entity2 were detained earlier this month after hundreds clashed with police during a protest against land seizures			2
the government says it has introduced initiatives to protect @entity13 culture , such as promoting folk music , encouraging @entity13 language in schools and building heritage centers			1
but critics argue that without a nomadic lifestyle , it is impossible for young @entity2 to learn about their ancestors ' way of life			1
" @entity2 have peacefully led a nomadic lifestyle for centuries so we need to ask why it 's being threatened now ? " says @entity130 , the lead singer of @entity131 , a @entity13 throat - singing band			1
" it 's important to prevent desertification , but at what cost ? why is this happening now and what other solutions are there ? " rapid development and the spread of @entity42 's dominant @entity144 population to minority regions , has meant that ethnic @entity2 only make up about 17 % of the region 's 24 million population , according to @entity42 's @entity148			1
like @entity150 and @entity151 from the restive of @entity147 , experts say an underlying tension exists between ethnic @entity2 and @entity144 people			1
@entity131 hopes to bridge that gap by educating the masses with their music			0
the @entity40 - based band consists of 10 band members who play around the world with indigenous @entity13 instruments such as the horse head fiddle , three - holed flute and mouth harp			0
in march , the group played at the international music festival @entity167 in @entity168 and @entity169 in @entity170 , with plans to tour @entity70 this summer			0
during a performance in their home town , the group demonstrated their music -- known for its rich blend of movement between hoomai , a deep guttural throat song , and the clear long notes of @entity180 , which uses the throat to create a whistle effect			0
but ownership over throat singing has struck a sensitive chord with ethnic @entity2 in recent years after the @entity186 ( @entity186 ) declared it an art native to @entity42			1
the @entity186 website states that @entity13 regions in @entity41 , western @entity2 and @entity190 all practice the art , but the country of origin is stated as @entity42			1
" personally , i think throat singing is part of our @entity13 culture , and it should belong to @entity2 , " says @entity130 , who oversees a workshop that teaches students to make traditional @entity13 instruments			1
" by teaching our art , we 're hoping the next generation can carry on our culture			0
