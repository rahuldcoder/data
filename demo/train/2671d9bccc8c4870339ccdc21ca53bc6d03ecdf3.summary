editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			1
@entity9 is @entity5 's site devoted to the overlap between culture and technology			1
the reports , which are being produced solely by @entity5 , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			1
we believe this unique approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			1
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- @entity23 may have given the world precision watches , but its biggest contribution to humanity is a giant time machine			1
buried beneath the @entity31 countryside and stretching across the border to @entity33 , the @entity29 is n't just any science experiment			1
the underground particle racetrack is present - day summation of questions about matter -- really , our entire puzzle - like understanding of the natural world -- that humans began to ask over a millennia ago			2
but it goes back much further than that			2
as it smashes trillions of protons together at near the speed of light in the hopes of breaking them apart to see what they 're made of , the @entity29 takes us back to the moments just after the birth of the universe			1
nearly a year after the proton beams were successfully circulated in the main ring of the collider , the project 's overseer , the @entity54 , or @entity54 , invited @entity9 to come by for a visit			1
in interviews with the research students and their bosses , including @entity64 , the project manager , we learned all about the $ 9 billion machine that 's 17 miles in circumference and straddles the border of @entity31 and @entity33			2
it 's arguably the fastest racetrack in the universe , able to create things like quark - gluon plasma and , if theory holds up , the @entity74 , the so - called @entity75 of particle physics			2
that might help explain why protons and neutrons weigh 100 times more than the quarks they 're made of , what dark matter is , and how the universe came to exist			2
but we were n't satisfied with merely a visit to the most intricate machine ever built			2
we also wanted to clear the air about something that had been bothering us , in a few different ways -- the imminent collapse of @entity91			2
that 's at least the theory of people like @entity95 , a professor of biochemistry at the @entity97			2
he argues that @entity54 's proton collisions could generate dangerous miniature black holes			1
these wo n't necessarily bring about the @entity102 -- there 's just a one - in - six chance			2
this kind of planetary @entity108 , @entity95 says , " is a risk you mus n't take			0
" while at least two separate scientific panels have certified the safety of the project , the doomsday theory has gained traction on the @entity116 , where , laments @entity54 spokesman @entity117 , " many sensible , intelligent and rational people have been unnecessarily worried by some some completely baseless speculation			1
" @entity95 's theory , meanwhile , has been met in kind from another left field - @entity121 's simultaneously serious and funny proposition that the many technical problems that have plagued the @entity29 are the work of a time - traveling @entity74 boson particle , hell - bent on preventing us from ever finding it , lest we say , opening up some sort of fundamental particle @entity131			1
this wonderfully absurd theory does n't stand up , according to @entity54 researchers , at least not since they observed cosmic rays with energies equal to and much higher than the @entity29			1
says @entity117 , " if he were right , we would not see such rays			0
" watch " @entity139 and @entity140 " at @entity9 still , technical issues have dotted the project 's history over its decades of construction and scant three years of operation			0
everything from electrical failures to minor explosions have given the project 's leaders , not to mention thousands of scientists around the world , a bit of indigestion			0
at the end of 2012 , the experiment will be shut down for a 15 - month upgrade , which became necessary after a nearly catastrophic accident in 2008 that cut the collider 's design energy in half			0
but the scientists have little to complain about			0
it 's not often that the stars align to allow for a project of this magnitude , and nothing this complex has ever been built before			0
it could have happened here			0
during the 1980s , @entity171 physicists looked with a fevered hope to a giant construction site in @entity174 , where the @entity175 was building the @entity176 , a particle accelerator intended to be the last word , for a few years at least , on particle physics research			0
but funding for the project was cut in the early 1990s , and today the giant tunnels built for the project lie fallow			0
it was a missed opportunity for the @entity171 , says physicist @entity185			0
" here 's this huge project , and we would have led the field in this subject , and now we just stand on the shores looking across the pond to @entity31 as @entity193 leads the way			0
" scientific competitiveness aside , the @entity29 is a truly international project , built in collaboration with over 10,000 scientists and engineers from over 100 countries			1
to process the data collected by the collider 's six particle detectors and distribute it to researchers around the world , @entity54 relies on another of its inventions			1
in 1990 , @entity54 physicist @entity208 , created the @entity209			1
today , the lab is developing a new approach to distributed computing it calls the grid			0
( no relation to " @entity216 " -- yet			0
) the aim is to make internet access to computing resources -- cpu and storage -- as accessible to users as the @entity209 makes access to information			0
the @entity209 has also been crucial in generating public interest in the @entity29 , with an assist , of course , from a strong marketing push			1
@entity54 has sought connections with @entity230 ( the collider played a starring role in @entity234 's version of @entity236 's " @entity235 " ) and the arts ( the lab has established an artist - in - residence program )			1
" we have been working for many years to build up @entity54 's public profile , " says @entity117 , " seeing the @entity29 as a unique opportunity to raise the profile of science in general			1
" as for the absurd theories , he says , " we 've had to build the buzz surrounding the more fanciful ideas into our communication strategies			0
" even if the popular fascination with the collider may sometimes stray into science fiction , it has made made its research not only the object of popular fascination , but a cause of inspiration too			0
in that way , the project is n't just looking for the @entity74			0
it 's helping humanity examine practically everything .			0
