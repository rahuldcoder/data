@entity0 maybe the thieves did n't know what they were stealing			1
a @entity5 car stolen from outside the hotel where the team was staying turned up on a rural @entity9 road saturday -- the day before the scheduled race at @entity0 , but not in time for the team to qualify			1
the no. 44 @entity12 was in a 26 - foot trailer , which was hitched to a pickup truck that was stolen early friday morning from the hotel in @entity16 , @entity9 , according to its owner , @entity18			1
the car normally travels in an 18 - wheeler , but the hauler arrived at the @entity0 early to escape bad weather back in @entity23 , @entity24 , the team said			1
the car remained behind for some minor work , said the team and driver @entity27			1
" it was n't quite ready to go to the racetrack yet , " @entity27 told @entity1 on saturday			2
" the guys had to continue to do some more work on it at the shop , so they stayed back with the car and then just sent it down a day later with the truck and smaller trailer and parked it in the hotel parking lot			1
" the trailer with car inside arrived at the hotel thursday night at 11 p.m. and hotel surveillance video shows the theft occurred at 5:32 a.m. friday , the team said			1
" i bet when whoever has it , opens the trailer and is going to be like ' oh snap ' , " @entity27 tweeted friday			1
early saturday , the team tweeted photos of the recovered orange and blue car , in the dark on the side of a road			1
the @entity12 was found by itself , minus the stolen @entity57 truck and trailer , in @entity59 , about 50 miles northeast of @entity0 , the team wrote in a series of tweets saturday			1
the truck was found later saturday on the side of a road in @entity67 , just north of the @entity0 , @entity64 sgt. @entity63 said			1
the driver 's side door handle was broken and there was damage to the ignition , he said			2
the spare motor and extra parts that had been with the car were not found , according to @entity18			1
the man who found the race car , @entity76 , says he was in disbelief when he saw it a few feet off the road			2

" i was like , that looks like a @entity5 ( car ) , " @entity76 told @entity1			0
" i turned around , put my headlights on it , and there it was			0
" @entity76 says he called police , who at first did n't believe him			0
in front of the car were ramps and next to it were the straps that secured the car in the trailer , he said			2
there were also dusty handprints above the driver 's door , he said -- though it 's not clear whether they were from the thieves			0
" obviously they are someone that knows the area -- that 's what was going through my head , " @entity76 said			0
" it 's got to be someone from around here			0
you do n't stumble across that road			0
" the theft forced the team to withdraw the car from sunday 's @entity121 500 , which was going to be the first @entity5 start of the season for @entity124			1
" the biggest thing is , we found that racecar , " @entity27 said			2
" it 's a small team and this ( would have been ) a big setback for us if that was missing			2
it was enough of a setback as it was , not being able to qualify and run the race at @entity0 this weekend			0
" @entity27 said he is " really thankful and happy for all the guys who worked so hard on this car			2
they put a lot of hours into it , and it would have been a real shame if it was gone			0

so far , @entity27 said , " it looks shipshape			0
