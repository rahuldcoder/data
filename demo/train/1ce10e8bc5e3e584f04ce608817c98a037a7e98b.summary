-- @entity2 's second stint as @entity4 manager did n't go nearly as well as the first			1
a dozen years after leading @entity4 to the @entity7 title in @entity8 , he resigned in the wake of the @entity4 's capitulation in the semifinals and third - place defeat on home soil last week			1
@entity14 thrashed @entity4 7 - 1 in the last four -- it was the first time a team scored seven goals in a @entity7 semifinal -- before the host meekly lost to the @entity20 3 - 0 on saturday			1
" @entity2 and his fellow coaching staff surrendered their positions to the board , " @entity4 's football federation , the @entity21 , said in a statement on its website , adding that the resignations were accepted			1
" @entity2 and all his backroom staff deserve our respect and thanks , " @entity21 president @entity29 told the website			2
" they were responsible for returning to the @entity37 people a love for the national side , even if they did not achieve our highest aim			0
" @entity2 's decision was fully expected , since he said he was " responsible " for the loss to @entity14			2
without injured talisman @entity43 and captain @entity44 in the heart of defense , @entity4 conceded four times in six minutes in the first half in @entity50 , leaving fans in tears in the stands			0
there was no respite in the third - place game as the @entity57 set the tone by netting in the third minute			0
@entity4 's @entity59 , who last guided @entity60 in his 20 - plus year coaching career , is the favorite to take over from @entity2			1
@entity64 boss @entity63 , @entity66 manager @entity65 and @entity68 striker ronaldo are also among the big names linked with the job			1
even with a team that was considered far from vintage -- especially compared to previous @entity4 sides -- many expected @entity4 to win the @entity7 after defeating @entity75 in the @entity77 final			2
but the warning signs that @entity4 were not exactly buzzing were there in the opening game of the group stages of the @entity81			0
@entity2 's side were fortunate to top @entity83 , benefiting from a dubious penalty			0
since cutting ties with @entity86 in 2008 , @entity2 has n't had success with any of the sides he 's managed , including @entity66 and @entity89 .			0

@entity2 resigns as @entity4 manager after @entity4 *thumped* in last two games
eventual champion @entity14 thrashed @entity4 7 - 1 in the semifinals before another defeat
@entity59 is now the favorite to succeed @entity2 , who guided @entity4 to 2002 @entity7 *glory*
others linked with the job include @entity63 , @entity65 and @entity103
