-- @entity1 and @entity2 remained on course for a semifinal showdown at the @entity5 with untroubled passage to the third round on wednesday , but top @entity9 hope @entity10 became the first high - profile casualty of the men 's draw			1
second seed @entity1 won in straight sets for the second match in a row , beating former world no. 2 @entity18 , while @entity2 had a walkover against another @entity20 , @entity21			1
@entity1 showed no signs of the recurring knee problem that troubled him before monday 's opening win as he triumphed 6 - 4 6 - 3 6 - 4 against the oldest player in the singles draw			1
the 33 - year - old @entity18 has reached the semifinals three times in @entity29 , but has fallen to 190th in the rankings after a series of injury problems			1
" i really practiced well , " said @entity1 , who next faces @entity35 's world no. 119 @entity33 -- a four - set conqueror of @entity9 @entity37			1
" i had very good preparation			0
i won already two matches in straight sets with positive feeling			0
" @entity2 , seeking his fifth title in the season 's opening grand slam and his 17th overall , will face big - serving @entity46 @entity45 in the last 32 following @entity21 's pre-match withdrawal with a back injury			1
the @entity50 third seed , whose last major title came in @entity53 in 2010 , had been due to play away from the main @entity55 court for the first time in 52 matches			2
but he said he was pleased that women players were getting more of a chance to play in marquee night matches this year , which means fewer late finishes for the men			0
" i do n't think it 's good that they always had the women 's match first			2
i think it 's good to mix it up , " the 30 - year - old said			0
eighth seed fish was less happy to play in the scorching afternoon heat , complaining about the timeouts that @entity74 opponent @entity73 took for treating cramps before sealing a 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) 6 - 3 7 - 6 ( 8 - 6 ) victory			1
" i thought he was having some physical issues			0
but then in between , on every point , he was totally fine , " fish said			0
" i have a hard time calling the trainer for anything			0
i would n't want the other guy to know that i was hurting in the first place			0
to be able to get help for lack of fitness ... i mean , if you saw how much water i drank in the past three days just to hydrate to make sure that something like that did n't happen -- i did all the right things there			0
" @entity73 , ranked 71st , will next play @entity20 's @entity96 , with the winner of that match likely to take on @entity100 11th seed @entity99			1
the 2009 @entity102 champion set up a third - round clash with @entity106 's world no. 79 @entity104 by beating @entity108 's @entity107 6 - 4 7 - 5 6 - 3 , continuing his career revival following longterm wrist injury			1
@entity113 seventh seed @entity111 went through after beating @entity115 's @entity114 in straight sets , and will next play big - serving @entity118 no. 30 @entity117			1
@entity9 16th seed @entity119 survived another marathon match as he defeated 2006 semifinalist @entity122 4 - 6 6 - 3 2 - 6 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) 10 - 8			1
the match lasted more than four and a half hours , and the deciding set went for 99 minutes -- with @entity122 furious that he was denied a video challenge at 8 - 8 when he held a break - point on @entity119 's serve			0
" obviously the ump did n't think he challenged in time , but maybe because of the crowd noise the ump could n't hear it or what not , " @entity119 said			0
" the break went in my favour , for sure			0
" @entity119 , who was involved in the longest match in tennis history at @entity136 in 2010 , won the game and then broke the @entity100 's serve in the next to set up a clash with @entity141 18th seed @entity139			2
his fellow @entity9 @entity142 lost to @entity53 's 19 - year - old rising star @entity143 , who will next face @entity145 13th seed @entity146			2
@entity141 10th seed @entity147 came from 2 - 1 down to beat @entity151 's @entity150 in five sets to book a tie with @entity50 21st seed @entity154 , who beat 2006 finalist @entity157 of @entity158 , 7 - 6 6 - 4 5 - 7 6 - 1 .			2
