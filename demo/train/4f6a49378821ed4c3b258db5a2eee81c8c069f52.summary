-- @entity2 , the state hardest hit by @entity5 's tainted egg scandal , has lifted a quarantine on 3,000 poultry and hog farms after tests proved negative for increased dioxin levels , officials said monday			1
the state may lift the quarantine on more farms once additional test results come in monday , said the state 's ministry for consumer protection and agriculture			1
also monday , @entity5 's minister for agriculture and consumer affairs , @entity21 , published an initiative for animal feed safety in reaction to the scandal			1
the initiative calls for consideration of harsher punishments for violations of the law			2
the list was published after a crisis meeting between @entity21 and representatives of the country 's animal feed industry			1
" today , events like the discovery of dioxin animal are not merely local in nature anymore			2
they have regional and possibly even global effects in concerning public health and economic damage , " the initiative says			2
" the federal ministries for consumer protection and justice together will explore the need to adjust current laws			0
" the initiative also calls for stricter registration rules and a strict separation of ingredients for animal feeds and those for other industrial processes			2
meanwhile , @entity56 investigators said monday they are looking into the possibility that contaminated animal feed from @entity5 may have been given to hens in @entity56			1
the feed , contaminated with dioxin , was purchased by a @entity56 firm late last year , said @entity63 with the @entity65 and @entity64			1
" there is an ongoing investigation to see if the contaminated feed was consumed by breeder hens , which are not meant for consumption , " he said			1
such hens are bred for their eggs , and not sold for their meat , he said			0
@entity63 said his agency was warned about the feed entering @entity56 by the @entity77 's food safety system , the @entity78 , on sunday			1
last week , @entity5 filed criminal charges against the company at the heart of the country 's tainted egg scandal			1
the company , @entity84 and @entity85 , apparently knew for months that fatty acid it was delivering to animal - feed makers was contaminated with dioxin , said @entity90 , a spokesman for the agricultural ministry in the @entity5 state of @entity93			1
criminal charges have been filed against the company , @entity90 said , " because they did not immediately inform " the agricultural ministry that dioxin levels surpassed the allowed amount			2
authorities allege that the company sold about 3,000 tons of contaminated fatty acids to dozens of companies making animal feed across @entity5			1
in response , the government quarantined more than 4,700 pig and poultry farms			0
@entity109 and @entity85 laboratory tests from march 2010 showed they exceeded the ceiling level for dioxin , he said			0
" at that point they had to stop delivering this product and immediately inform the authorities			0
they did not do either , " @entity90 said			0
government officials learned of the higher concentrations of dioxin in december , he said			0
several attempts to reach @entity109 and @entity85 last week for comment were unsuccessful			0
dioxin levels in the final feed product were diluted and it is likely they did not exceed allowed amounts , @entity90 said			2
" of course that is no excuse			0
the conduct is still wrong , " he said			0
the farms shut down include not only ones raising chickens and other poultry , but also pig farms , said @entity134 , a spokesman for @entity5 's @entity135			2
state authorities quarantined all farms that received animal feed from companies affected , regardless of whether there is proof that the feed was contaminated , the ministry 's website said			1
" the state authorities are right to quarantine products -- eggs and meat -- that may have been exposed to contaminated feed , even if there is no concrete scientific evidence in all cases , " @entity21 said in a statement			1
about 130,000 possibly contaminated eggs were exported from a company in @entity5 to a food company in @entity157 , where they were to be used in industrial food production , said @entity159 , a spokesman for @entity5 's @entity135			1
the @entity160 said a pasteurized mixture including some of the contaminated eggs was distributed in @entity163			0
" the mixing of the eggs will have diluted the levels of dioxins and they are not thought to be a risk to health , " the agency said in a statement			0
dioxins are a family of toxic chemicals that share a similar chemical structure and have been characterized by the @entity177 @entity176 as likely human carcinogens			0
@entity0 's @entity179 in @entity180 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 says it may lift the quarantine on more farms
@entity56 thinks some contaminated feed may have been given to hens there
