@entity0 -- president @entity2 and his @entity4 counterpart , @entity3 , in 1971 discussed ways their countries could work together to overthrow the socialist government of @entity8 in @entity9 , according to a newly declassified document			1
president @entity2 , right , and his @entity4 counterpart , @entity3			1
during a meeting of the two leaders at the @entity14 on december 9 of that year , @entity3 was discussing the possibility of a coup by the @entity9 military with assistance from @entity4 military officers when @entity2 said that it was " very important that @entity4 and the @entity21 work closely in this field , " according to the document			1
@entity2 offered money or other discreet aid for the effort if it could be made available , the document shows			1
" we must try and prevent new @entity28 and @entity29 , and try where possible to reverse these trends , " @entity2 said			0
@entity3 said he was " happy to see that the @entity4 and @entity33 positions and views " were so close			2
the declassified document , a previously top secret memorandum for @entity2 's file written by national security adviser @entity38 , was published by the @entity39 , a nongovernmental research institute in @entity0			2
the memorandum , along with other documents , were declassified in july as part of the @entity43 's @entity45 series			2
" this is an explosive document that details collusion between the colossus of the @entity52 [ the @entity21 ] and the colossus of the @entity54 [ @entity4 ] , " said @entity46 , the director of a @entity9 and @entity47 for the @entity39			1
he called it " a smoking gun of confirmation of @entity4 's effort to engage in operations to overthrow the government of @entity9 and a discussion of collusion with the @entity21			2
" the two leaders also discussed the creation of a back channel for direct communication outside normal diplomatic protocols , according to the document			0
each designated personal aides to carry handwritten communications back and forth to keep discussions out of official records			0
" i think there is precedent , but we 've never seen it detailed in a document this way , in which two presidents set up the utmost secret of back - channel communications so they can discuss the most sensitive aspects of collusion and collaboration in efforts to challenge the left in @entity33 and change the futures of select @entity33 governments , " @entity46 said			0
he added that " there 's a significant paper trail of evidence of what that collusion was that remains secret , and we 're going to have to press @entity4 and @entity0 to recover those documents			0
" despite the leaders ' effort to keep the subject of their talks secret , word got out			0
a declassified @entity102 memorandum written some time after the @entity104 meeting in @entity0 said that word of the secret talks between the two leaders about shaping @entity4 foreign policy filtered down to @entity4 military officers by a " @entity110 leak			1
" gen. @entity112 , commander of @entity4 's @entity113 , reacted to this by saying that the @entity21 obviously wanted @entity4 " to do the dirty work , " it said			1
a declassified @entity102 national intelligence estimate written in 1972 concluded , " @entity4 will be playing a bigger role in hemispheric affairs and seeking to fill whatever vacuum the @entity21 leaves behind			1
it is unlikely that @entity4 will intervene openly in its neighbors ' internal affairs , but the regime will not be above using the threat of intervention or tools of diplomacy and covert action to oppose leftist regimes , to keep friendly governments in office , or to help place them there			0
" the newly published documents do not offer any conclusive proof of @entity4 involvement in the @entity9 coup of 1973 , which the @entity2 administration supported			1
@entity46 said that with the passage of time and change in governments in all of the countries involved , the real story of diplomatic and covert collusion between the @entity21 and @entity4 in @entity9 can finally be told			2
the @entity39 will push for the declassification and publication of more top - secret documents from the @entity148 , he said , and will approach @entity4 government officials to ask for their cooperation in getting documents released in @entity0 and @entity152 , the capital of @entity4			0
@entity46 said he also hopes that surviving @entity9 government and military officers from the era who knew of any arrangements with the @entity4 government will come forward and tell their stories			0
" this is history for history 's sake , but history will not find closure until it 's fully aired , " he said .			0
