-- navigating a narrow channel through the reef , our zodiacs slide onto a crushed coral beach and we scramble onto mature - vavao , an uninhabited atoll at the eastern edge of @entity8			1
it 's a gorgeous little island , shaded by thousands of coconut palms and encircled by bands of water that run a dozen different shades of blue			2
expedition leader @entity15 thinks this might be the first time a cruise ship has ever visited the island and there 's a good chance nobody has set foot on the atoll in 30 years			1
the landing party turns left along the shore			0
but i blaze my own path straight ahead to the lagoon that dominates the middle of the island			0
boobies , terns and other seabirds pay me scant attention			0
most have probably never seen a person			0
wading into the lagoon to cool off and spy on the tropical fish , i 'm overcome by the sense i 'm one of the few people who has ever set foot on this small patch of planet earth			2
it 's as close as i 'll ever come to the emotion that @entity45 must have felt when he first set foot on the moon , or the rush that mariners like @entity49 and @entity50 no doubt got when they came across terra incognita			1
discovering the remote but that 's what this cruise is all about			1
a three - week journey between @entity59 and @entity60 , it calls on some of the world 's most remote and least - visited islands			1
organized by @entity65 - based @entity64 , the voyage includes gourmet cuisine , top - notch lecturers and a bartender who can make even the most obscure cocktails			2
but the real reason that 60 - odd passengers have paid five figures for this cruise is geographical bragging rights -- a chance to boast to friends and colleagues back home that you 've hobnobbed with @entity81 's kinfolk on @entity82 , explored ancient @entity8 cave dwellings on @entity84 and frolicked with manta rays off @entity86 before visiting @entity88 's grave on the same secluded island			1
you know a cruise is something special when your fellow passengers include renowned marine archeologist @entity94 and best - selling author and shipwreck detective @entity96			2
even for men like these , with all the adventures already under their belts , the voyage is unique			0
we 're three days out from @entity59 before land is spotted again -- uninhabited @entity104 , a small atoll in what really is the middle of nowhere			1
tumbling into the water , i explore the reef with @entity15 , one of @entity112 's founders and a veteran marine biologist			2
grove wants to show us something he found 25 years ago -- three rusty anchors -- all that remains of the mail ship " @entity118 , " which ran aground on @entity104 in 1881			0
an incredible array of sea life floats around the wreck -- moorish idols , butterflies , turquoise parrots and white tip reef sharks that warily watch us from afar			2
island stops the following day we land on @entity84 , an uplifted coral block that resembles a huge white table that 's emerged from the ocean			1
other than odd geology , the island 's claim to fame is the real - life " @entity135			1
" when the @entity139 whaler " @entity138 " was rammed and sunk by a sperm whale in 1820 , this is where the survivors took refuge			0
( no , their captain was n't named @entity145			0
) but those shipwrecked whalers were n't the first residents			0
i follow expedition anthropologist @entity149 up a cliff face and into a cave where there 's evidence of long - ago human occupation -- a fire pit and stone scraping tool			1
" we do n't know for sure , " says @entity149 , " because nobody was around to record their history , but we think a small @entity8 colony existed here more than 500 years ago			1
" @entity82 is the first populated island we come across in nearly a week			1
and it 's just barely inhabited -- roughly 50 people , nearly all of them related to @entity81 and other " @entity167 " mutineers			2
it 's a strange little corner of the @entity169 , with a long and sometimes dark history			2
the only way to land on @entity82 is literally surfing 12 - foot waves into the tiny , jetty - enclosed harbor			1
from there it 's an uphill climb to @entity176 , the only settlement , where the residents greet us with a fish - and - chips lunch , cold beer and open - air craft stalls hawking @entity82 flags , postage stamps , organic honey and " @entity167 " replicas -- one of the islanders ' only means of making foreign exchange			1
one of those i meet at lunch is seventh generation @entity82 resident @entity194 , who invites me to hop on the back of his atv for a spin around the steep volcanic isle			1
covered in tattoos and body piercings , he seems every bit as roguish as his mutinous ancestor			0
like most everyone on the island , @entity204 is a jack of several trades : @entity209 and photographer , government warehouse supervisor and cemetery caretaker , black pearl jewelry artist and website creator			0
his mountaintop home looks out over the vast @entity216 , both an inspiring view and a constant reminder of how isolated @entity82 remains even in the 21st century			1
spear throwing and octopi from @entity82 we sail north towards the @entity222 , calling on several isolated atolls along the eastern edge of @entity8			1
the residents of @entity226 entertain us with a spear - throwing contest and a demonstration of barehanded octopus fishing			2
in the tiny @entity231 on @entity232 -- the first island that @entity49 spotted on his trans - @entity216 passage -- local @entity230 spontaneously bursts into a @entity236 hymn he remembers from his choir boy days			1
the fabled @entity222 finally come into view near the end of our second week at sea			2
like something out of " @entity243 , " towering volcanic pillars and jungle - shrouded cliffs mark the entrance to the @entity247 on @entity249 island			0
rising behind the shore are cloud - shrouded heights that look as if they just might harbor giant apes or some other mystical creature			1
but the most menacing thing we encounter hiking into the @entity249 highlands is a pond full of spotted , foot - long eels			2
@entity260 tries to catch one with his bare hands , but they 're far too slippery			0
further up the trail we come across the remains of three old marae -- shrines made from dark volcanic stones and now almost hidden by the jungle			0
this spot was somehow sacred to the ancient polynesians who built these temples			0
perhaps they thought their gods lived up here or maybe it was the splendid isolation			0
we explore even higher , bushwhacking our way with machetes to the base of a colossal cliff laced with veil - thin waterfalls			0
nearby is a natural rock pool that offers liquid relief from the sweaty uphill climb			0
nobody , not even @entity260 , has been here before or even knew it existed			0
lying on my back in the water , staring up at the misty volcanic peaks , i find myself wondering yet again how many human beings have ever been here			0
@entity64 offers its @entity59 - @entity60 cruise once per year , with rates from $ 11,970 per person			1
@entity295 is a freelance travel , business and entertainment writer based in @entity299 .			0

three - week journey from @entity59 to @entity60 stops at remote @entity8 islands
@entity84 's claim to fame is the real - life " @entity135 "
the only way to land on @entity82 is to surf 12 - foot waves into the tiny , jetty - enclosed harbor
