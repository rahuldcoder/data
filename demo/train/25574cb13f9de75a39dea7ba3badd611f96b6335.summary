-- my favorite part of academic debate has always been the cross-examination period			0
we got a little piece of that ( but not enough ) in the @entity9 presidential debate tuesday hosted by @entity10 and the @entity11			0
the presidential hopefuls were allowed to ask an opponent one question			0
@entity15 faced seven opponents , and four of them directed their questions at him because he is seen as the frontrunner			1
while this can be a good idea in theory to try and trip up the frontrunner , it actually helped @entity15			1
the only two people to get significant air time in the first hour were @entity15 and @entity27			1
so by asking @entity15 more questions , the other candidates gave him even more time to present his case to the public			1
the strategy of the other candidates might have worked if he was on the ropes or was stumbling in the debate , but @entity15 had not given his opponents any obvious openings			1
in his answers to the four questions from his opponents , @entity15 did well			1
his answer to @entity41 's question was one of @entity15 's strongest moments of the debate when he highlighted how his economic plan would help the middle class			1
he underscored that the middle class has been hit the hardest by the economic downturn , so any presidential candidate should begin by focusing on helping them			0
@entity27 is pretty clever in these exchanges			1
you can tell he has a few lines that are well rehearsed			0
in fact , when it was his turn to ask a question , i actually thought he might try to ask himself the question			0
that way he could insert 9 - 9 - 9 into both a question and an answer ( which would be a feat even for him )			0
instead he asked @entity15 if he could list off all 59 points of his plan			1
this question was designed to showcase the simplicity of @entity27 's plan in comparison			1
the question was effective enough , but might have backfired when @entity15 used it to his advantage to say that simple answers are oftentimes inadequate			1
@entity15 took a unique approach			1
his question was directed at @entity74			0
on its face , it seems like a puzzling approach , but i actually like the strategy			0
it gave air time to someone @entity15 does not think will be a factor , thereby taking time away from his main rivals			2
plus , he simply asked @entity74 how she could help the economy by putting people to work , which guided her answer away from attacking @entity15 in her free time			2
it was a smart choice			0
three of the candidates used their questions to also make solid points			2
@entity96 asked @entity27 about his time spent chairing a @entity98 , which is a negative with @entity96			2
@entity96 's question made the argument that he was correct all along about not trusting the @entity98			0
@entity74 used her question to attack @entity102 and remind everyone that she has always been a conservative while @entity102 used to be a @entity105 working for @entity106			2
@entity107 also asked @entity27 a question that made an argument			2
as part of his question , he attacked the 9 - 9 - 9 plan by asking the audience who wanted to pay a 9 % sales tax			0
@entity107 then asked the audience if they believed the federal government would stick to a 9 % income tax			0
he used their silence to question and attack @entity27			2
share your view on the debate @entity102 does n't seem to get any part of these debates right , and that included the section where he was allowed to ask any other candidate a question			2
@entity102 asked @entity15 a question about health care , but he failed to have depth in his question or attack			1
@entity102 failed to make a positive point about his own health care policy and forgot that in answering the question , @entity15 would get to freely blast away at the lack of health care for children in @entity102 's home state of @entity142			1
this was a perfect example of the person answering the questions turning it against the questioner			0
as is becoming a trend in these debates , @entity102 came out on the wrong end of that exchange			0
presidential candidates should get to ask each other more questions in the future			1
such an approach would add substance , and allowing follow - up questions by the candidates would be even better , since we could more easily judge the depth and knowledge of each candidate			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			0

@entity166 : candidates directed their questions at front - runner @entity15
he says @entity15 handled the questions *deftly*
@entity166 says @entity27 seems well prepared while @entity102 fares poorly
he says candidates should get to ask each other more questions in the future
