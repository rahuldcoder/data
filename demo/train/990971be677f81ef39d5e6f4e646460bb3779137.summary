@entity1 's ruler handed over the reins of the tiny but influential @entity4 nation to his son tuesday -- a development seen as remarkable for several reasons			2
sheikh @entity9 's decision to cede power willingly is a first in the modern history of the region			1
the norm is for @entity4 leaders to rule for decades until their death or until circumstances conspire to overthrow them , such as the @entity19 uprisings that toppled leaders in @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			2
@entity9 himself came to power in 1995 by overthrowing his father in a bloodless coup			2
the second reason tuesday 's transition is historic is because the son , @entity30 , now becomes the youngest monarch in the region			1
while the timing of the handover was unexpected , @entity30 has been heir apparent for the past decade and was appointed deputy commander - in - chief of @entity1 's armed forces			1
he was educated in @entity38 , first at private school and later at @entity41 military academy , also attended by @entity38 's @entity42 and @entity43 , from which he graduated 15 years ago			2
@entity9 made the announcement in a televised speech on tuesday , a national holiday			2
" @entity48 only knows i never wanted power for personal reasons and i never sought power for any personal motive , " the outgoing emir said			1
" it is all about the best interest of the nation that made us decide that it is time to start a new page in our history where the new generations take over with their great qualifications and ground - breaking ideas			0
" the outgoing emir is 61 and appears to be in good health			1
the energy - rich emirate has backed @entity67 rebels in their fight against the @entity70 regime , and @entity72 militants have set up an office there amid diplomacy to end the @entity76 war			0
the prestigious soccer @entity78 will be held there in 2022			0
@entity30 was involved in the bid to bring the tournament to @entity1 , as well as heading his country 's @entity82 since 2000			1
opinion : @entity1 changes leaders , now can it start reforms ? unusual power transfer @entity89 , a @entity90 analyst at @entity91 , said that while @entity30 had been groomed for power for some time , especially over the past two years , it was still a surprise to see the handover come so soon			1
" in terms of modern @entity97 , this is very significant			0
it 's the first time in recent history we have seen such a transfer of power from a living monarch to the next generation , " he said			1
it 's also a marked contrast to what is happening in @entity108 , he said , where the rulers are quite reluctant to hand over leadership to the next generation			0
the transfer of power is unlikely to lead to major policy changes , at least initially , said @entity89 , since @entity9 would have been unlikely to hand it over unless his son was " capable and willing to take @entity1 down a broadly similar path			1
" but @entity89 predicts that @entity30 is likely to focus more on domestic issues than @entity1 's international role to start with			1
his father worked to " put @entity1 on the map " by extending its network of alliances and influence to counter the sway of its powerful neighbors , @entity120 and @entity108 , he said			0
but how greatly it will be involved in @entity67 under @entity30 " is the big question , " said @entity89 , since @entity1 has already started to pull back on that front and let @entity108 take a lead			2
critics have suggested @entity1 gives too much support to islamists in @entity67 , @entity22 and elsewhere , he said			0
@entity1 's huge foreign investment program will probably continue under @entity136 , @entity1 's prime minister and foreign minister , although his future role is unclear , he added			0
the @entity139 , a prominent opposition group , congratulated @entity1 on what it described as a " pioneering and unprecedented step that gives the @entity19 an additional big boost			0
" the council 's statement also praised the outgoing emir for his hard work and vision for the region , adding that it is " confident that the ever evolving @entity1 with its new young leadership will always align itself with the rights of the @entity67 people			1
" in a @entity155 statement , @entity153 president @entity152 welcomed @entity30 to his new role , saying @entity1 was an " important partner " and paying tribute to his father 's leadership			1
" the @entity153 looks forward to working with @entity30 to deepen the ties between our two countries , and to continue our close partnership on issues of mutual interest , " @entity152 said			1
reaction on social media social media has been abuzz over the news of the power transfer , with people thanking @entity9 for his efforts			1
one tweeter said , " @entity175 changed a tiny desert hamlet to a powerful economic empire			0
" another said , " i have watched @entity1 become an economic , sports , education and political leader			0
you will always be in our hearts			0
" @entity38 foreign secretary @entity187 also chimed in , tweeting , " historic day for @entity1 as the new generation takes over			0
" @entity9 was probably motivated by the desire for an orderly transition , having seen close - up what can happen if an older generation clings to power or an impatient crown prince plots a coup , said @entity89			2
however , @entity30 's youth " does n't mean that he will be more open to democratic reforms , " as some might hope , he cautioned			2
" his age is largely irrelevant to a conservative mindset			0
nothing is proven yet -- we shall have to wait and see what line he will take			0
