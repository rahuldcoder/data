-- pirates boarded an @entity3 yacht off the coast of @entity5 three days after the boat 's owners split off from the relative safety of a sailing group traversing a dangerous section of the @entity11 , according to the group , the @entity12			1
the yacht , the @entity14 , was overtaken by pirates on friday , according to @entity3 officials			1
@entity18 and @entity19 and two other people on board , @entity22 and @entity23 , had been traveling with yachts participating in the @entity12 since their departure from @entity26 , @entity27 , the rally group said sunday in a statement on its website			1
but they broke off on february 15 after leaving @entity31 , @entity32 , to take a different route , the group said			1
" we feel desperately sorry for our four friends onboard and our thoughts are with them and their friends and family , " the @entity35 - based group said in a posting on its website			2
" all the yachts still on the rally are fine and well			0
" @entity3 officials have not identified the people on board the ship , but have confirmed that four @entity3 citizens are involved			1
@entity3 officials have made no further comment on the situation since rear adm. @entity49 , deputy commander of the @entity51 's @entity50 , said saturday that the government is evaluating its options			1
another @entity3 official , who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation , said previously that the @entity3 is determining what military assets are in the region and the capabilities of the personnel onboard			1
the official said that the pirates are believed to be onboard the yacht with the @entity3 , and the next step would be to determine whether the military could keep the yacht from reaching the shore -- either by blocking or harassing it			1
the @entity69 are experienced boaters , having started a world tour in 2004 , and were very much conscious of the threat from pirates , said a friend of the @entity69 , fellow boater @entity74			2
. @entity19 said several weeks ago that he was concerned about pirate activity in the area , which he had never visited before , @entity74 said			0
but he said @entity19 was determined to traverse the world himself as opposed to shipping the boat -- as some other yacht owners have done			1
@entity74 also said the @entity69 had also been traveling with others on a " buddy boat , " but those people decided not to continue			2
on their website , the @entity69 say their mission " is to allow the power of the @entity86 to transform lives ... ( and ) seek fertile ground for the word and homes for our bibles			0
" but @entity74 said vigorous evangelism was n't a major emphasis for the couple			2
" they use the @entity98 as an ice breaker , " he said			0
the couple posted to their website earlier this year about their travel plans , including a refueling stop in @entity105 , another pirate flash - point			2
" @entity105 is a big refueling stop , " said the post , which is not dated			0
" i have no idea what will happen in these ports , but perhaps we 'll do some local touring			0
" they also sent out an e-mail several days ago expressing some unease , @entity74 said			0
piracy has flourished off the coast of @entity120 , which has not had an effective government for two decades			0
in april 2009 , pirates seized the @entity3 - flagged @entity123 , leading to a standoff in the @entity11			1
@entity3 forces moved to rescue @entity3 capt. @entity127 after seeing a pirate aiming a weapon on his back , officials said at the time			2
three pirates were killed and one was arrested			0
the @entity120 man arrested was sentenced to more than 30 years in prison			0
