it swept across 214 countries worldwide and killed more than 18,000 people			2
the 2009 h1n1 influenza outbreak , dubbed " swine flu , " put the entire world on alert			1
the outbreak was declared to be a global pandemic until august 2010			1
but threat of deadly disease outbreaks did n't stop -- or start -- there			1
in 2003 , @entity13 ( @entity13 ) crossed the world , originating in @entity15 and reaching @entity16 in less than a day			1
then , in 2012 , a new virus emerged in the @entity18 and has now entered the global arena			1
aptly named @entity21 ( @entity22 ) it continued to spread globally with outbreaks now taking place in @entity25			1
as of june 3 , 1179 people have been infected with @entity22 across 25 countries -- including 442 deaths -- according to the @entity29			2
the current outbreak in @entity25 has led to 35 confirmed cases -- including 3 deaths -- and as of june 2 , 1369 people were under quarantine			2
the virus began its spread slowly initially but is now gaining momentum			0
in 2014 , the disease on everyone 's mind was @entity41			1
the ebola virus has infected more than 27,000 people across ten countries to date , with more than 11,100 deaths as of 13 june 2015			0
however , despite the high number of infections , the spread of @entity41 remains technically an outbreak , not a pandemic , because it has n't spread globally			1
" it will only be over when the last person with @entity41 is either dead or recovered without infecting other people , " stated @entity51 , who co-discovered the virus in the 1970s , at the 2015 @entity54 meeting in @entity55			1
but he warned that risks from such outbreaks were far from over , saying : " there will be other @entity41 outbreaks and there will be other epidemics , not least influenza			1
" but is the world ready ? hundreds of infectious diseases continue to plague the planet in both urban and rural locations , from ones spread by insects , such as @entity72 , which is currently sweeping through the @entity74 , to those spread by water , such as cholera , or human contact , such as @entity41			1
" infectious organisms can travel in humans , food and insects ... you ca n't stop disease from crossing borders , " says @entity79 , head of the @entity80 at think tank @entity81			0
one initiative in place to identify those posing a more global risk is the @entity29 - led @entity92 and @entity93 ( @entity94 )			1
" [ it 's ] a series of laboratories , national public health institutions and groups like @entity99 who report regularly when an outbreak occurs , " says @entity79			1
the goal is the rapid identification , confirmation and response to outbreaks of international importance			1
" the ones with most risk are airborne , " says @entity79			1
the greatest pandemic to date was the @entity112 flu which spread in 1918 and is estimated to have infected a third of the world 's population at the time and caused approximately 50 million deaths			2
more recently , the hardest hitting outbreaks were the @entity119 in 2003 , followed by @entity121 influenza virus in 2009			2
all of which were respiratory infections with the potential to spread far and fast			2
" with flu i 'm quite sure there will be another pandemic , " says @entity125 , chair in influenza virology at @entity127 , @entity128			2
@entity132 researches the origin of pandemics and why some viruses cross species to jump from animals into humans			0
in the case of @entity121 , the virus was a re-assortment of bird flu and pig influenza viruses , resulting in a new form infectious to humans and with no immunity among those at risk			2
" if it 's a new one , there 's no pre-existing antibodies to hold that off ... and you may then pass it on to someone else , " says @entity132			0
experts agree that future outbreaks and potential pandemics may occur , but the lessons learned from previous ones should enable a faster response			1
the key is to identify the virus , estimate its threat and its potential to spread across a population as quickly as possible to then put a pandemic preparedness plan into action			1
" @entity173 is difficult to control in terms of an outbreak , " says @entity132 , as the virus has the ability to spread before people show symptoms , meaning measures such as airport screening are ineffective			0
the converse is true for viruses such as @entity41 and particularly @entity13 , where people are only contagious once showing symptoms of the disease			1
" we were able to contain @entity13 , " says @entity132 , because patients could only transmit the virus days after symptoms had begun			1
if a patient was admitted to hospital soon after their symptoms appeared , there was a lesser risk that they had already infected others in their wake			0
the challenge facing public health teams across the world is the fact they must be ready to expect the unexpected			2
@entity13 , swine flu and @entity41 took everyone by surprise			1
" it 's completely unpredictable in the end , " says @entity132			0
confronting this unknown are mathematical modelers , including the @entity204 ( @entity204 ) -- a network of scientists who visualize how a disease might spread			0
" it 's useful to predict where an outbreak is going , " says @entity208 , the former scientific director of @entity204			0
under @entity208 's leadership , the modelers in her program predicted scenarios for various big outbreaks , including @entity121 and currently @entity41			1
information about the biology of the virus , the mode of transmission , and the geographical spread can be used to predict who will be affected next and how fast they 'll be reached			0
the various scenarios modeled are then used to inform policy decisions such as travel restrictions and school closures by determining their impact			0
it 's also crucial to envision the distribution of vaccines , to ensure the most vulnerable are reached first			0
in the case of @entity41 , models helped determine the number of hospital beds required in high - risk areas			1
the likelihood of disease models accurately reflecting reality are regularly called into question but @entity208 states they are crucial when working with the unknown			0
" infectious disease models are never going to accurately predict the future , " she says			0
" [ they ] are better at saying ' if we do this , here 's the range of things that can happen			0
' " when a virus is well understood , such models can be generated quickly			0
" models can integrate complexities in a way our brains ca n't , " says @entity208			0
however , the spread of a disease is about more than its biology			0
human behavior plays a key role and is much harder to predict , as was the case for @entity41 , where burial traditions and cultural practices aided transmission when the outbreak emerged			1
the lack of trust between those affected in @entity273 and their health authorities also prevented people from seeking diagnosis and treatment			2
" [ there 's been a ] great deal more collaboration in @entity41 , " says @entity208 speaking of weekly phone calls between those working on control , including scientists , researchers , homeland security and national laboratories			1
" the world is unprepared , " stated @entity29 director general @entity289 at a session alongside @entity51 in @entity55			0
" after @entity121 , the conclusion was the world is ill prepared for severe and sustained disease			0
" in her eyes , the scale of @entity41 last year was unprecedented			1
new ideas are needed to prevent this happening again in the future			0
" we need to think outside the box in the future , " says @entity132 , whose team works on the development of vaccines to stop the @entity302 in its tracks			0
but she does n't think disease - specific vaccines are the way forward for all outbreaks			2
" for @entity41 , @entity72 , @entity313 fever , @entity311 ... are we really going to invent one for each one ? " @entity132 instead thinks one way forward could be therapeutics that tackle the symptoms of disease , meaning where diseases have similar symptoms -- such as @entity41 and marburg virus disease -- there could be a drug against the symptoms of all of them to reduce further spread of infections			1
but when it comes to influenza , where the greatest global risk lies , the experts seem more optimistic			1
" if we had another flu pandemic we would be fairly well set to run models quickly , " says @entity208			2
given the likelihood of another pandemic , @entity132 's team see it fit in this case to develop disease - specific antivirals and vaccines against influenza when it arrives			0
in 2009 , the development of an @entity121 vaccine slowed down the spread of the virus during the second wave of its transmission			0
the time taken for development meant it was n't available during the first big wave of infections			0
at the core of it all , the global monitoring systems in place are constantly being tuned to spot any strange , or new , occurrences			2
" i look at @entity94 as a safety net , " concludes @entity79			0
@entity357 is growing its capability to both spot and control disease outbreaks , with a network of labs , provision of advice and assistance when a new outbreak occurs			2
it is also building capacity within countries through improved labs , technology and skilled staff , to enable systems to be in place worldwide to tackle new or emerging infections spreading throughout a population			0
" countries that have had @entity41 are more ready to deal with it , like the @entity381 ( @entity381 ) , " says @entity79 of the country where the disease was first identified in 1976			1
@entity381 communities now have a word for the disease and messages are in place to send out when a new outbreak occurs			0
with @entity22 now climbing to the top as the infection on people 's minds , its worth knowing that whilst we may not be quite ready to prevent disease outbreaks , we are , at least , more ready than ever before			2
