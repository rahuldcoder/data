-- in " @entity6 , " @entity2 's shrewdly revved - up and exciting dystopian thriller , @entity4 's character , @entity5 , spends most of the movie with a spidery black - metal exoskeleton implanted in his skull and spine			1
the surgically attached machinery serves several functions at once			0
it 's there to make @entity5 strong — a boost he critically needs , since he 's been exposed to a dose of radiation that will leave him dead in just five days			2
it also allows him to download the contents of someone else 's brain			0
but the most important purpose served by that added hardware may be visual and symbolic : it transforms @entity5 into a hulkingly damaged yet superheroic man - machine — a variation on the title character of " @entity28			0
" and it has the unmistakable look of a cross that he 's been nailed to			0
box office preview : ' @entity6 ' may lift off faster than ' planes ' @entity5 is n't just fighting to save himself or his fellow earthlings			1
he 's a guy who 's been souped up into a post-apocalyptic , action - movie @entity36			1
" @entity6 " confirms the talent — for razory mayhem and shocking satire , for the crazed spectacle of future decay — that @entity2 showcased in his amazing first feature , " @entity43 " ( 2009 )			1
i 've never forgotten that film 's images of gargantuan alien spaceships hovering in the air , or of droid wars as bloody and frenzied as a heavy - metal version of the @entity51			2
in " @entity6 , " @entity2 comes up with sci - fi conceits that sear themselves into your imagination			1
the film is set in 2154 , and much of it takes place in a crumbling shantytown @entity60			0
@entity61 has become a great big slovenly police state , with citizens kept in check by clanging robot officers programmed to presume that you 're guilty			0
@entity5 , a former car thief who now works on an assembly line ( that 's where he gets zapped with radiation ) , is hauled before his parole officer , who turns out to be an old carnival mannequin that speaks like a voicemail menu and says things like '' stop talking ! '' ' @entity6 ' : @entity73 suspended above this hellhole society is a twirling , man - made satellite called @entity6 , where the elite live			1
from a distance ( it can be glimpsed in the noon sky ) , @entity6 looks like the steering wheel of a ' 60s @entity81			2
up close , we can see that the vast metal rim contains a sprawling prefab suburban paradise — acres and acres of pristine lawns and @entity86			0
the people who live there have all they want , yet @entity2 's sly joke is that even the world that everyone on @entity61 covets is a paper - thin and almost virtual place			1
the key advantage of living on @entity6 is that each home is equipped with a healing chamber that will cure everything from flesh wounds to cancer in five seconds			2
that 's why @entity5 , joining forces with his old underworld cronies , will do anything to get there : it 's the only way his irradiated body can survive			0
" @entity6 " takes off from a pure existential thriller situation ( which it borrows from the great 1950 film noir " @entity110 " ) , and it 's been shot in an incredibly effective mode of raggedy , quick - cut anxiety			1
yet apart from that health care allegory ( and the 1 percent -- versus -- 99 percent theme it emerges from ) , the plot is fairly basic			2
i wish that the film had more of the tasty futuristic detail promised by that dummy parole officer			0
i also wish that @entity2 took us deeper into the world of @entity6			1
@entity5 has to outwit the fascist politician who 's plotting to take over ( she 's played by @entity124 with angry clipped diction and not a lot more )			0
but once he 's up there , @entity6 turns into a virtuoso gun battle that might be taking place almost anywhere			1
what makes it matter is @entity4 , who has kicked butt before but never with this kind of underlying brotherhood - of - man melancholy			1
