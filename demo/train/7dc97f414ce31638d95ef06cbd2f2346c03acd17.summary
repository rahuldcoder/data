-- it was the moment the world had been waiting for , and as he has so often in his glittering career , @entity3 delivered			1
after a frantic opening to the @entity9 in @entity10 with entertainment and goals aplenty , one of its gold - plated stars announced his arrival in style			1
a trademark slaloming run from the @entity17 striker ended in the fashion soccer fans have become well accustomed to -- with the net rippling			0
in truth , @entity20 were far from their best against the @entity9 debutantes @entity24 despite going 1 - 0 up thanks to the quickest goal at the @entity9 to date			1
@entity27 was the unwitting scorer , diverting the ball into his own net after a @entity3 free kick was glanced on by @entity31			2
@entity33 's men could n't build on that early lead though as @entity24 and @entity35 held their own until the interval			1
@entity20 's lead was doubled on 65 minutes thanks to a piece of magic from their talisman			1
@entity3 swapped passes with @entity43 and sidestepped two challenges before firing home off the inside of the post via a slight deflection			2
his vigorous celebration perhaps showed the pressure he was under to perform , as the endless comparisons to @entity20 's other world famous player -- @entity54 -- go on			2
a goal from substitute @entity56 ensured a nervy final six minutes but @entity20 held out to secure three important points			2
@entity58 3 - 0 @entity59 the first @entity9 goal to be awarded via goal - line technology helped @entity58 to a convincing 3 - 0 victory over 10 - man @entity59 in @entity64			1
@entity65 , who had put @entity58 ahead thanks to a first half penalty , fired a shot against the post only for @entity59 keeper @entity69 to inadvertently nudge the ball towards goal			1
it was awarded by the referee after goal - line technology -- introduced for the first time at this @entity9 by @entity76 -- instructed him the ball had crossed the line			1
replays inside the stadium led to boos from some supporters , as the big screen flashed up ' no goal ' for the initial effort that hit the upright , then ' goal ' after the ball had cannoned off @entity87			0
aside from the confusion it was a routine win for an energetic @entity58 side , whose task was made easier when @entity59 went down to 10 men			1
@entity94 , who plays for @entity96 side @entity95 , had already been booked when he barged into @entity97 , conceding a penalty and attracting a second booking			0
@entity65 duly dispatched the spot kick as @entity58 seized the initiative just before the interval			1
then just three minutes after the break came a landmark moment for the world game when @entity65 's volley from an exquisite @entity108 pass flashed back off the post			2
@entity69 tried to parry the ball clear as it hurtled towards him but only succeeded in flicking it over the line , the referee confirming the goal a few seconds later			2
@entity59 protested and the replays led to confusion but the goal was awarded , four years after the incident in @entity119 that led @entity76 president @entity120 to change his mind on technology			1
a shot from @entity125 's @entity124 flicked off the bar and bounced down a yard over the line in their quarterfinal with @entity131 but the goal was n't awarded			1
there was no doubt about @entity65 's second , as he fired emphatically into the roof of the net after pouncing on a loose ball , completing a perfect opening night for @entity58 coach @entity140			1
@entity142 2 - 1 @entity141 the other game in @entity144 on sunday was a tale of two super subs for @entity142 as an injury time winner from @entity149 broke @entity151 hearts in @entity152			1
the striker came off the bench to pounce in the dying seconds of the game after another sub -- @entity156 -- had canceled out @entity158 's early header			0
it meant that after nine matches at the @entity9 , there is still to be a draw			2
after a low key opening it was @entity141 who struck first , as @entity158 planted a firm header into the net from @entity169 's center			0
@entity142 , tipped by many as @entity9 dark horses , struggled to get into any sort of rhythm and squandered a succession of set pieces			0
but its two - time @entity177 winning coach @entity176 got his half time tactical tinkering just right and it drew level within minutes of the restart			0
@entity176 brought striker @entity156 on for @entity181 and the @entity182 forward nodded home from close range			0
@entity186 goalkeeper @entity185 saved well from @entity187 before @entity188 had a goal ruled out for offside as the match neared a dramatic conclusion			0
@entity141 had a great chance to find the net but @entity195 was tackled brilliantly by @entity196 , who then launched a counter attack			0
the referee played an excellent advantage after @entity196 was fouled and the move ended with @entity201 finishing off @entity203 's low cross			0
" we 've done it , and that 's unbelievable , " @entity176 was quoted as saying by @entity76 's website			0
" we never stopped believing in ourselves			0
i 'm extremely happy with the three points and it means it 's a good start			0

@entity3 announces his @entity9 arrival with brilliant goal for @entity20
@entity3 's strike lifts @entity20 to a 2 - 1 win over @entity24
@entity65 brace helps @entity58 beat 10 - man @entity59 3 - 0 in @entity144
match sees first @entity9 goal awarded via the use of goal - line technology
