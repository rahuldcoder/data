@entity0 , @entity1 -- election results in four major @entity1 states friday marked a momentous comeback for the country 's ruling @entity7 - led coalition , although it was undercut in one state by backlash against a graft - tainted coalition member			2
analysts say the good showing for prime minister @entity15 's coalition is a much - needed boost for the government , battered by a series of corruption scandals , rising inflation , and low investor confidence in @entity23 's third largest economy			1
in the eastern state of @entity26 , more than three decades of communist rule came to an end as the @entity7 led by populist leader @entity28 won a landslide victory			1
the @entity30 of @entity1 also lost its strong hold in the southern state of @entity33			0
analysts say the left 's @entity36 economic policies seem increasingly outdated in the world 's second - fastest growing major economy			0
the only remaining red state in @entity1 is @entity41 in the northeast , with a scant population of 3.6 million people			0
meanwhile , in the southern state of @entity47 , the federal coalition was defeated as its key ally , the @entity49 , lost its political monopoly			1
the @entity49 party has been badly hit by a multibillion - dollar telecoms corruption scandal that has cost the country up to $ 31 billion , according to a government audit			1
the man at the center of the scandal , @entity58 , is a @entity49 member and former telecoms minister			1
he was arrested last month for his alleged involvement in the selling of telecom licenses at rock - bottom prices			0
" the @entity49 party has institutionalized corruption in @entity47 for years and their defeat clearly shows voters will no longer tolerate corruption , " said political analyst @entity64 of the @entity65			1
@entity47 's chief minister and the head of the @entity49 party , @entity71 , resigned after his party 's defeat			1
@entity71 's daughter and @entity49 lawmaker @entity75 also faces charges for her alleged involvement in the telecom scandal			2
a court will is expected to decide whether @entity75 will be sent to jail on saturday			0
" for the longest time , local elections in @entity1 were fought along caste or religious issues , " @entity64 said			0
" but now people are awakened , they are saying no to politicians or political families who have dominated for so many decades			0
" analysts say these election results are crucial as the coalition will be in a better position to act on long - awaited reforms such as a new legislation on land acquisition			0
they say the regional elections could be considered a referendum ahead of the national elections in 2014 .			2

the regional elections give a boost to the prime minister 's government
three decades of @entity30 rule end in @entity26
but the coalition loses in @entity47 as a scandal *hurts* the @entity49 party
