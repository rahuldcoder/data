-- @entity1 does n't much like the @entity2 -- and the feeling is mutual			2
but on thursday the @entity2 will be coming to the @entity4 to meet with @entity1 and his fast - track gun reform task force , formed after the @entity6 and due to submit its recommendations by the end of the month			1
there are obviously deep divisions between the two -- they are never going to agree on the vast majority of proposals , especially the assault weapons ban ( despite the fact that it was once backed by @entity17 ) and a ban on high - capacity ammunition clips			0
but there may be some surprising opportunities to find common ground , even on this most contentious issue			2
the @entity2 has backed specific plans to crack down on gun violence in the past that the president could enact through executive order , and polls of @entity2 members suggest there is even more unexpected common ground to be found			1
for example , the @entity33 is an existing law that has been underfunded and insufficiently implemented			0
updated after the @entity37 shootings , backed by the @entity2 and signed into law by president @entity39 , the law requires federally licensed gun dealers to check with a coordinated federal database to see whether the would - be gun buyer has any history of dangerous mental health problems -- as well as criminal record , arrest warrants , or orders of civil protection -- that would stop them from owning a firearm under existing law			1
the @entity37 shooter , @entity53 , who killed 32 people in the span of a few hours , had been previously diagnosed as mentally ill and could have been stopped from purchasing his murder weapons if the information had been available to the background check system			0
but since @entity37 , states have made only limited progress in reporting the critical mental health information , primarily because @entity63 has failed to provide the necessary funding , granting just 5.3 % of the total authorized amount during the @entity66 years			0
increased screening for mental health is one of the few areas the @entity2 agreed should be focused on in the wake of @entity6 and yet the @entity66 administration and @entity63 have failed to enforce the existing law by depriving it of funds needed for implementation			1
politics : how the @entity2 wields its influence likewise , the @entity2 has long championed @entity76 , a pilot program first implemented in @entity78 , @entity79 , which prosecuted serious local gun crimes committed by felons under federal law , putting repeat offenders in federal prisons far away from their communities			2
this get - tough approach , which inspired president @entity39 's national initiative @entity88 , ended up cutting the " gun carry " rate in half and reducing the murder rate in @entity78 by more than 60 %			0
the five - year mandatory sentence for committing a crime with an illegal gun changed criminal behavior			0
similar initiatives have been implemented in cities throughout the country , but the coordination has been spotty and the @entity66 administration has failed to follow through on the model or add innovations to it			0
finally , president @entity66 could order the @entity104 to increase the prosecutions of people who falsify information on their gun background checks			1
in 2009 , the @entity109 reported 71,000 instances of people lying on their background checks to buy guns			0
but the @entity104 prosecuted just 77 cases -- that 's about 1/10th of 1 %			0
a lack of follow through from the federal government is letting these gun criminals walk , and that sends a message about lack of enforcement that only encourages systematic disrespect for existing gun laws			1
there 's a pattern here			0
before the @entity6 shootings , the @entity66 administration had not made enforcement of existing guns laws a political or policy priority as the @entity132 administration did , which got it repeatedly butting heads with the @entity2 in the process			1
this may in part be connected to a political strategy implemented by then - rep. @entity139 in 2006 , when he courted pro-gun @entity140 as part of a successful effort to retake control of @entity63 , an experience he carried with him to his role as @entity66 's first @entity4 chief of staff before being elected mayor of @entity149			1
" during the @entity132 administration there were efforts to fully enforce the gun laws we have through innovative crime gun tracing projects , partnerships with state and local law enforcement and tough prosecution initiatives , " said @entity150 , an adviser to @entity152 mayor @entity151 on illegal guns from 2006 - 11			2
" so far , the @entity66 administration has failed to live up to that legacy and has not used its executive powers to the fullest to fight illegal guns			2
" but the @entity2 has been the prime opponent of many other new gun laws and stalled funding for many existing programs in @entity63			1
before drawing widespread criticism for suggesting that armed guards be placed in public schools after the @entity6 slaughter , the @entity2 had opposed seemingly common sense measures like barring individuals on the @entity109 terrorist watch list from buying and owning weapons			1
politics : @entity1 's vow on curbing gun violence interestingly , conservative pollster @entity181 found that clear majorities of @entity2 members are more reasonable about implementing such common sense measures than their more rigidly ideological parent organization			1
for example , 71 % of @entity2 members would bar people on the @entity109 terrorist watch list from buying and owning weapons , according to a poll @entity181 conducted for the @entity191 - backed group @entity190			1
likewise , 79 % of @entity2 members support requiring background checks on gun retail employees , 74 % would support background checks on all potential gun buyers and 64 % support requiring gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms			1
the @entity2 itself has changed since the conservative movement coalesced to take over the previously sportsman - focused organization			0
in the 1930s , the @entity2 supported the @entity204 ban on machine guns , which still stands			0
likewise , the @entity2 backed the 1968 @entity206 passed by president @entity207 after the assassinations of the rev. @entity209 and @entity210			1
" today 's @entity2 is not that of our grandfathers , " said @entity150			0
" unfortunately , the leadership of the @entity2 has turned the organization into an obstacle , rather than the partner of decades ago , in the effort to pass smart laws to keep guns away from dangerous people			2
" the @entity2 's hard turn to the right makes it highly unlikely that it will want to work with the @entity4 on any measure			2
but in fact there is some common ground to be found , even between these political foes			2
ironically , that common ground is likely to be found in increased federal enforcement of existing laws through executive order , the same remedy that the @entity234 disgustingly demagogued on wednesday by comparing executive orders by the president of the @entity204 to tyrannical actions taken by the mass murderers @entity239 and @entity240			1
it was a shocking reminder of just how unhinged and hateful our civic debates have become			0
but beyond these efforts to fear - monger for political and personal profit , the fact that some common ground exists between the @entity4 and the @entity2 on gun control should be a heartening sign , a reality check amid all the overheated rhetoric			1
reasoning together to solve problems should never be considered impossible in @entity204			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity255 .			0

@entity255 : the @entity2 and the @entity4 share common ground on gun control
@entity255 : in the past , the @entity2 has backed specific plans to crack down on gun violence
he says polls show that most @entity2 members support common sense measures
@entity255 : @entity66 should increase federal enforcement of existing laws through executive order
