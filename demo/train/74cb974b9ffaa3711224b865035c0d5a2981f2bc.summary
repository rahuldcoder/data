@entity1 , @entity0 -- opponents of controversial plans to use hybrid human - animal embryos for research spoke out tuesday , calling the practice unnecessary , unnatural , and reprehensible a day after @entity9 lawmakers voted to allow it			1
advocates of hybrid cells say animal eggs from which a nucleus has been removed are simply " empty shells			1
" the @entity9 parliament debated the issue monday as part of its discussion of the @entity21 and @entity20 , which will update legislation on reproduction and embryos			1
" crossing the species barrier in this way is deeply , deeply reprehensible , undesirable , " said @entity25 , a bioethicist who founded @entity26 on @entity27 ( @entity28 )			1
the research involves emptying an animal egg and filling it with human cells			1
the resulting embryo is allowed to develop for 14 days -- during which time scientists harvest the stem cells -- before being destroyed			1
scientists hope working with those stem cells will lead to treatments for serious conditions like motor neuron disease , @entity42 's , and @entity43 's , and they say using hybrids overcomes the shortage of human embryos			1
" the use of animal eggs will provide a valuable resource to embryo research scientists , " argued public health minister @entity47			1
lawmakers were allowed to vote according to conscience and the legislation passed comfortably , though not without opposition			0
" if an embryo could talk , perhaps it would echo what @entity58 did say in ' @entity60 ' : ' i , the miserable and the abandoned , an abortion to be spurned out and kicked and trampled on , ' " @entity63 lawmaker @entity62 told parliament			0
supporters of the research dispute the numerous " @entity60 " references and say it does not create monsters			0
@entity71 , director of the stem cell biology lab at @entity73 in @entity1 , said the practice begins with the removal of an animal egg 's nucleus , which contains all of the chromosomes , thereby stripping the egg of its " species identity			1
" " it 's an empty shell , " @entity71 said			0
" by putting a human cell -- not just a nucleus , but in our case an intact human cell -- into the egg , you confer a human genetic identity onto that			2
" the approved bill creates a legal framework for the scientific research on hybrid embryos			1
@entity9 prime minister @entity95 feels so strongly about the benefits of the research that he wrote a column sunday in @entity100 newspaper calling it an " inherently moral endeavor , " but ethics groups and others disagree			2
" i think we all know that we do n't reproduce with animals , " @entity25 said			0
" humans do not reproduce with animals			0
whether it 's done in the laboratory or not does n't make it right			0
" @entity25 urged the government and the scientific community to wait until a new method of research emerges which does not mix animal and human genetic material			2
@entity117 , a secular independent watchdog , said it found defects among existing hybrid embryos which raise doubts about whether mixed embryos can produce useful stem cells			1
" i 'm very , very unimpressed with the scientific case for doing that , " said @entity123 , a former molecular biologist who now heads the @entity117			0
" the science is so weak and the ethical concerns are so significant , i think you have to weigh that			0
" the scientific arguments in favor of the research have been " overhyped , " @entity123 said , and offer no hope of a cure for those suffering with genetic disorders			2
" very little , i think , will come out of it and i think hopes are being raised that will be cruelly disappointed , " @entity123 said			0
the @entity21 and @entity20 was drawn up in 1990 , when science and government were unaware that current hybrid - embryo developments were possible , a spokeswoman for the @entity144 told @entity2			0
the original bill did allow the mixing of human and animal eggs , but only for the purpose of testing the fertility of human sperm , said the spokeswoman , who declined to be named in line with policy			2
the practice was known as the " hamster test " because hamster eggs were used			0
the revised bill now allows hybrid embryos for further research but specifies they may not be placed in a woman or an animal , the spokeswoman said			1
also , those using the embryos must prove that the use is for research , and that use of an embryo is necessary , she said			2
creating hybrid embryos is not the only way to develop useful stem cells , said @entity71			1
a new method called pluripotency , developed in december , allows scientists to turn adult cells into something resembling an embryonic stem cell , he said			1
@entity176 , however , requires extensive genetic manipulation of the cells and yields few that are of use to research , @entity71 said			2
" we will pursue that ( research ) but it 's just too early to know which is the best approach , " @entity71 said			0
" most rational scientists would say we need to proceed down as many tracks as possible because we just have no idea what 's going to lead to the best benefit			0
" @entity2 's @entity191 contributed to this report .			0

@entity9 lawmakers approve bill allowing use of hybrid embryos in stem cell research
opponents describe controversial *technique* as " deeply , deeply reprehensible "
advocates say use of animal embryos helps overcome shortage of human embryos
scientists say stem cells have potential to cure conditions such as @entity42 's
