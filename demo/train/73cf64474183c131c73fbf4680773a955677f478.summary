@entity0 -- the curious timing of @entity5 's @entity4 rocket launch , outside of its usual spring - summer launch window , raises questions about the political motivations behind @entity10 's attention - grabbing move			1
on wednesday morning , just before 10 a.m. local time , @entity13 news agency @entity11 and the @entity16 government reported that the rocket had been launched			2
it came just days after @entity5 extended the launch window due to technical issues			2

this year , @entity33 is experiencing a unique convergence of elections and leadership transitions in the @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity16 and @entity13			0
this follows the change of leadership in @entity5 in december 2011			0

proliferation - related negotiating activity is on hold , leaving a diplomatic vacuum until the new governments are settled			0
while @entity5 appears to have no intention of relinquishing its nuclear or missile capabilities , its habitual tactic of engineering crises to leverage aid from the international community in exchange for de-escalation or proliferation freeze agreements is predicated on negotiations actually taking place			0

the gambit fails if there are no negotiations			0
a december rocket launch sends a strong signal from @entity10 to its regional interlocutors to ensure that @entity5 does not get overlooked amid the bureaucratic maelstrom that usually follows changes in government			1
it will test the resolve of the new leadership teams and yield clues as to how they are likely to react individually and coordinate together in relation to @entity5 in future			0
read more : one week in @entity5 whichever candidate wins the election in @entity97 is likely to move away from @entity99 's disastrous " reciprocity " policy toward greater engagement with @entity10			2
@entity16 is likely to adopt a more hawkish approach to @entity5 if the @entity103 wins the election , as polls currently suggest			0
how @entity5 fits within the @entity38 - @entity37 relationship will also be of interest to @entity10 , with @entity48 and his new @entity108 at the helm in @entity110			2
a successful rocket launch would also represent a sterling commemoration of the first anniversary of @entity115 's death on december 17 , much as the unsuccessful april launch was intended for propaganda purposes as a celebration of @entity120 's centenary			1
by demonstrating technological prowess , it would legitimize the regime 's " strong and prosperous country " rhetoric and bestow prestige on @entity5 's young new ruler , @entity127			1
similarly , @entity47 's prickly reactions to @entity10 's provocations play into the @entity120 regime 's anti-imperialist ideology , the staple of its propaganda output			0

any economic reform program in @entity5 risks creating new socio - economic cleavages -- grassroots entrepreneurialism and linkages to the global economy could foster powerful domestic actors who may develop interests that differ to those of the ruling regime			2
for @entity127 , legitimacy and prestige will be paramount if his government chooses to walk the path of economic adjustments			0
one should also not discount the strategic motivations for the timing of the launch			0
in the past year @entity13 has announced its deployment of cruise missiles with a range of 1,000 kilometers , capable of hitting targets anywhere in @entity5 , along with tactical ballistic missiles and drones with a range of 300 kilometers			2
it 's no stretch to interpret @entity5 's rocket launch in terms of a classic arms race , as a missile test in response to its adversary 's upgraded missile systems			1
the demonstration of a viable long - range rocket will add another piece to @entity5 's nuclear deterrence posture			1
@entity10 has yet to master long - range , multi-stage missile technology , despite a long developmental phase punctuated by a number of unsuccessful tests			1
a successful launch may herald a movement from the developmental phase of the long - range missile program closer to deployment			1
this would increase @entity10 's strategic and diplomatic leverage in relation to its northeast @entity192 neighbors and its ability to use this event as a bargaining chip to extract further aid from the international community			0
foreign policy decisions are generally arise from a mixture of motivations			0
the unique confluence of leadership transitions across the region in late 2012 coincides with a @entity5 state at an interesting point in its evolution			0
@entity5 's rocket launch suggests important clues about the manner in which @entity127 and his government are attempting to navigate the swirling regional , strategic and domestic currents .			1
