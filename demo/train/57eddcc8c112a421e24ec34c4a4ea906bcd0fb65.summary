-- criminals who file fraudulent tax returns by stealing people 's identities could rake in an estimated $ 26 billion over the next five years because the @entity6 can not keep up with the amount of the fraud , treasury inspector general @entity1 said tuesday			1
" our analysis found that , although the @entity6 detects and prevents a large number of fraudulent refunds based on false income documents , there is much fraud that it does not detect , " said @entity1 's prepared testimony before a joint hearing of the @entity11 and @entity12			1
@entity1 's report is the first detailed analysis of the tax refund fraud problem , which could affect any legitimate taxpayer			1
his projection of $ 26 billion is larger than any other estimate of identity theft tax fraud			1
in a statement issued following @entity1 's testimony , the @entity6 said it " believes that the five - year estimate is far too high			1
" " the estimate was based on 2010 figures , which took place before the @entity6 instituted major changes with the way it handles identity theft cases , " the @entity6 statement read			2
" our expanded screening on issues such as w - 2 matching , @entity41 information , interest income and social security income have had a major impact on our ability to reduce identity theft fraud			0
" those efforts , according to the @entity6 , have lead to " stopping more refund fraud than ever before " and " are not reflected in the five - year projection " by the @entity51 inspector general			1
last year , according to the treasury inspector @entity52 , the @entity6 reported that of the 2.2 million tax returns it found to be fraudulent , about 940,000 returns totaling $ 6.5 billion were related to identity theft			1
in its investigation , @entity1 said , auditors found another 1.5 million undetected tax returns with more than $ 5.2 billion in fraud			1
" the primary characteristic of these cases is that the identity thief reports false income and withholding to generate a fraudulent tax return , " @entity1 said			1
" without the falsely reported income , many of the deductions and / or credits used to inflate the fraudulent tax refund could not be claimed on the tax return			1
the individuals whose identities were stolen may not even be aware that their identities were used to file a fraudulent tax return			2
" making the problem worse , @entity1 said , the @entity6 is hampered by limited resources			2
" even with improved identification of these returns , the next step of verifying whether the returns are fraudulent will require resources , " he said			2
" the @entity6 has faced budget cuts , a hiring freeze and staffing reductions during the same time it has encountered a significant surge in identity theft refund fraud			1
without the necessary resources , it is unlikely that the @entity6 will be able to work the entire inventory of potentially fraudulent returns it identifies			1
the @entity6 will only select those tax returns that it can verify based on its resources			1
" the scope of the problem is illustrated by what @entity1 said his auditors found for tax year 2010 , in which 48,357 social security numbers were used multiple times as a primary taxpayer identification number			2
" when the identity thief files the fraudulent tax return , the @entity6 does not yet know that the individual 's identity will be used more than once , " @entity1 said			1
" as a result , the tax return is processed , and the fraudulent refund is issued			2
these instances result in the greatest burden to the legitimate taxpayer			0
" as of last month , the @entity6 reported that it had stopped the issuance of $ 1.3 billion in potentially fraudulent tax returns			1
the @entity6 says it determined these returns were potentially fraudulent through a sampling of returns , and it does not believe any legitimate returns were included			1
@entity1 said more should be done to ensure that fraudulent tax returns are not deposited into bank accounts			1
in addition , thieves commonly get the refunds put on debit cards			0
" direct deposits should not be made to debit cards issued by financial institutions and debit card administration companies that do not take sufficient steps to authenticate individuals ' identities , " @entity1 said			0
to make matters worse , the @entity6 is not effectively helping the victims of identity theft , @entity1 said , adding that it can take more than a year to resolve these cases			2
" the @entity6 acknowledges that it does not know the exact number of identity theft incidents or the number of taxpayers affected by identity theft , " @entity1 said			0
" it also has not been able to quantify the amount of improper payments resulting from identity theft			0
" in an investigation into tax refund fraud , @entity0 reported in march that criminals have purchased luxury cars , jewelry and plastic surgery with the money			0
first , thieves obtain @entity12 numbers and other personal information from insiders at hospitals , doctor 's offices , car dealerships or anywhere the information is stored			0
then , they file an online tax return using the real taxpayer 's name and a fictitious income			0
in most cases , the criminals buy a debit card so the @entity6 can issue the refund on that card , although some thieves have also gotten their returns on actual @entity51 checks			1
the thieves know that the @entity6 does not verify the employer w - 2s sent with the return until after the refund is issued			0
the @entity6 maintains it has certain filters in place at the start of the tax filing season to prevent and detect identity theft and fraud , and it says it has recently trained additional employees across the country to deal with the problem			1
it has also issued special personal identification numbers , or @entity181 , to identity theft victims when they are filing future returns			0
but in testimony before @entity186 last year , national taxpayer advocate @entity184 said those filters " inevitably block large numbers of proper refund claims " since there " is no easy way to distinguish proper claims from improper ones			0
" in testimony prepared for tuesday 's hearing , deputy irs commissioner @entity195 said the agency can not stop all identity theft			0
" however , we have improved , and we are committed to continuing to improve our programs			0
we can and will continue to work to prevent the issuance of fraudulent refunds , and we can and will continue to work with innocent taxpayers to clear their accounts and / or get them money faster in a courteous and professional manner			0
" at the same time , @entity195 said , there is a " delicate balance " in the " need to make payments in a timely manner with the need to ensure that claims are proper and taxpayer rights are protected			0
" in the past four years , he said , the @entity6 has identified more than 490,000 taxpayers who are the victims of identity theft			0
" various new identity theft filters are in place to improve our ability to spot false returns before they are processed and before a refund is issued , " @entity195 said			0
the @entity6 has issued special identification numbers to taxpayers whose identities have been stolen and clamped down on abuses in filing returns under deceased taxpayers ' identities and prisoners			2
the agency also started a pilot program in april to help local law enforcement in obtaining tax return information related to ongoing criminal investigations			0
" i can not tell you that we will beat this problem in one year , " @entity195 said			0
" i can tell you that we have committed our talents and resources to prevent the issuance of fraudulent returns and have developed processes to minimize the pain felt by those who have been victimized			2

the @entity51 's estimate is the first detailed analysis of the ongoing problem
with budget cuts , the @entity6 can not deal with the fraud , according to inspector general
@entity6 says it stopped the issuance of $ 1.3 billion in potentially fraudulent tax returns
