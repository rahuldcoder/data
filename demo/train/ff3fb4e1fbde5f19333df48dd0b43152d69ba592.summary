-- the latest prediction for the 2009 @entity3 hurricane season agrees with three previous ones , forecasting a season that will be at least a bit milder than last year 's			1
last year 's most destructive hurricane , @entity8 , tossed boats onto the shore in @entity11 , @entity12 , in september			0
@entity13 is the most recent organization to release its outlook , predicting wednesday that the season , which runs from june 1 to november 30 , will bring 13 named storms and eight hurricanes			1
in 2008 , there were 16 named storms and eight hurricanes , five of which were major -- that is , classified as @entity22 on the @entity22 scale of storm intensity -- with winds of 111 mph or higher			1
the three previous forecasts were released in december by @entity27 ( 14 named storms , seven hurricanes ) , @entity30 ( 13 named storms , seven hurricanes ) and @entity32 ( seven named storms , four hurricanes )			1
storms acquire a name when they are designated tropical storms , with sustained maximum winds of at least 39 mph			0
though they foresee fewer storms than last year , all the forecasts except the one from the @entity32 would translate into an above - average season			2
according to the @entity43 , a " normal " @entity3 season has 11 named storms , six hurricanes and two major hurricanes			1
@entity43 wo n't release its predictions until closer to the start of the season			2
and the forecasts already made are likely to be updated as june draws near			0
@entity13 projected that four of the hurricanes in 2009 will hit the @entity53 @entity52 or @entity54 , and one of those will be a category 3			2
@entity58 , @entity13 's chief long - range forecaster , wrote on the company 's web site that this year 's " storms may be more likely to form in the @entity63 closer to the coast , and the possibility of a major hurricane making landfall in the @entity53 can not be ruled out			1
" @entity30 , on its web site , said its predictions for 2009 stemmed from the expected continuation of " warmer - than - normal @entity3 temperature anomalies into next summer and fall , and the likelihood of a favorable or neutral wind shear environment associated with the lack of an @entity78 event			2
" @entity78 is a fluctuation in the ocean - atmosphere system in the tropical @entity81 that can impact global weather			0
last year was considered the fourth busiest @entity3 hurricane year since 1944			1
the @entity83 said 2008 was " the only year on record in which a major hurricane existed in every month from july through november in the north @entity3			1
" the most destructive was @entity8 , which wiped out neighborhoods in parts of @entity12			0
even a week later , its remnants were still having an impact on the @entity92			0
two other hurricanes made landfall in the @entity53 last year -- @entity95 and @entity96			0
neither was a major hurricane at the time it came ashore .			0

@entity13 forecast joins three others predicting milder hurricane season
