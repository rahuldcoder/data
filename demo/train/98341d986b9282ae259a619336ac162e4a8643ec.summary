-- all five remaining inmates held in the @entity3 pardons controversy have now been released from prison			1
@entity3 's @entity5 last week upheld the controversial pardons of more than 200 convicts that former gov. @entity8 granted on his way out of office , rejecting a challenge by the state 's attorney general			1
in a 77 - page , 6 - 3 ruling thursday afternoon , the court found the pardons " may not be set aside or voided by the judicial branch			0
" attorney general @entity19 argued that no proper notice had been posted in newspapers , but the court found the final decision rested " solely with the governor			1
" " we are mindful that the victims and their families are entitled to be interested in the subject matter of this case , and they are undoubtedly -- and understandably -- concerned with its outcome , " justice @entity25 wrote for the majority			0
but in the cases before them , it was up to the governor to " decide whether the @entity39 's publication requirement was met			1
" in a statement after the court ruling , @entity8 said it " reaffirmed more than a century of settled law in our state , " but acknowledged that his decision has been difficult for many of the inmates ' victims			1
but in a dissenting opinion , justice @entity50 called the decision " a stunning victory for some lawless convicted felons , and an immeasurable loss for the law - abiding citizens of our state			0
" @entity19 argued that the state constitution required that for a pardon to be valid , notices be filed , each day , for 30 days in newspapers where their crimes were committed			0
but during a february @entity5 hearing , @entity8 's lawyers argued that previous state court rulings had found the 30 - day notice rule was " an unconstitutional encroachment " on the governor 's power			1
thursday 's ruling is the final word on the case , but @entity19 said he would seek to get the notice requirement restored to the state charter			2
" we do respect the decision of the court , but feel deeply for how it must weigh on the victims and their families			2
it is these victims and family members who have lost today and the criminals who have won , " he said in a statement , echoing @entity50 's dissent			2
among the 214 inmates @entity8 pardoned before he left office in january were four convicted murderers who had worked as " trusties " at the governor 's mansion			1
critics argued that the governor failed to consider the families of their victims before freeing them			2
all four and an armed robber also pardoned by @entity8 had remained free while the issue worked its way through the courts , and were freed under thursday 's decision			0
five other inmates who had remained behind bars awaiting a ruling have been released			0
@entity8 has defended his pardons and said the former inmates had been rehabilitated			0
