@entity0 -- after missing her first day of community service at the @entity0 morgue , actress @entity2 gets a second chance to appear on time friday			1
" @entity2 arrived at the morgue approximately 20 minutes late and will be returning for orientation tomorrow , " said her publicist @entity7 thursday			1
just a day earlier , a judge rebuked @entity2 for similar failures , revoked her probation and forced her to post $ 100,000 bail			1
" her lateness was due to a combination of not knowing what entrance to go through and confusion caused by the media waiting for her arrival , " @entity13 said in a statement			0
" @entity2 spoke with the supervisors at the morgue			0
they showed her how to get in , and everything is all cleared up			0
" chief coroner @entity26 said @entity2 failed to show up on time -- 10 a.m. et thursday -- to the coroner 's office			1
though she arrived late , @entity2 was turned away because there was n't enough time to complete her hours for the day , officials said			2
@entity34 judge @entity33 ruled wednesday that after @entity2 posted $ 100,000 bail for her probation revocation , she had to perform two working shifts -- or eight hours a day -- twice a week until her probation revocation hearing november 2			2
@entity2 's tardiness thursday does n't mean she is turned away from the program , @entity26 said			1
if @entity2 shows up friday on time , she will be allowed to work and perform her community service , @entity26 said			1
the coroner 's office will dismiss @entity2 from her morgue duties only if she does something " terribly " wrong or shows misconduct , @entity26 said			2
@entity33 revoked probation for @entity2 because of her failure to comply with community service at a downtown @entity0 women 's center			1
under @entity33 's ruling , once @entity2 made bail the same day , the actress now must perform 16 hours of community service a week -- over a minimum of two days a week -- at the county morgue before her probation violation hearing next month			1
@entity2 , 25 , was on probation after pleading guilty in may to stealing a necklace from a @entity59 , @entity60 , jewelry store			0
she served five weeks of home confinement ending in june for that misdemeanor theft and violation of another probation			0
@entity2 's legal woes began in 2007 with two drunken driving arrests and have been compounded by her failure to attend counseling classes and her failures of alcohol and drug tests			1
her current probation calls for her to perform 360 hours at the @entity72 and 120 hours at the county morgue within a year			0
but the judge expressed anger wednesday at @entity2 's repeated probation failures			1
she said @entity2 posted nine absences at the women 's center since her last court hearing july 21 -- and performed , at most , only two hours of service			2
@entity2 's attempt to perform community service at a nearby @entity85 facility -- instead of the women 's center -- was voided wednesday because the judge said she did n't authorize that change			1
after the hearing , @entity13 released a statement : " @entity2 is hoping this matter will be resolved on november 2 and the court will reinstate probation and allow her to continue fulfilling her community service			1
" @entity2 's estranged father , @entity94 , told @entity101 's " issues with @entity100 " that his daughter needs " a very , very intensive " program of rehabilitation for substance abuse			2
" what the judge did , she had to do , " he said wednesday			0
but he said jail time would not be the proper remedy			0
" she 's not going to be working the morgue			0
she 's going to wind up in a morgue if someone does n't do something to get her help , " he said			0
at one point during this week 's hearing , @entity0 city attorneys @entity111 and @entity113 asked the court to revoke @entity2 's probation and impose jail time because of her failure to do community service			1
one of the city attorneys said @entity2 " is in violation for getting herself kicked out of the women 's center , which she was ordered to do			0
" but @entity2 's attorney told the court that the actress received " a glowing " probation report , which said that " ms. @entity2 has reached a turning point " in her behavior and maturity			1
the judge raised several questions about the reliability of that report , however			0
@entity33 remarked how the probation report showed @entity2 had excused absences from community service between september 9 and october 5 so that she could travel to @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , and @entity142 for work			1
but a psychologist 's report said @entity2 had perfect attendance for counseling every week , the judge observed			2
" the psychologist said she appeared in person for her counseling every tuesday , " the judge said			0
" i do n't know how she did that			0
" " did she go to @entity140 for five days and come back in time or go to @entity142 for five days and come back in time ? " @entity33 asked the defense attorney			0
" if she was gone from september 9 to october 5 , did she get beamed across the pond ? i do n't know how that happened , " the judge said			0
@entity2 's attorney , @entity156 , told @entity33 that she did n't know the specifics of @entity2 's psychological appointments , but the attorney said the arrangement did call for phone conferences			2
@entity162 added that @entity2 's work in @entity164 was done to support her and her family -- and affected her ability to carry out the community service			1
" because the work is out of the county , it did cause a disruption to her schedule " to do community service , @entity162 said			2
@entity2 's community service at the county morgue wo n't be easy , the judge noted			1
" they do n't mess around and you show up and do what they tell you to do , " @entity33 said			0
@entity1 's @entity181 contributed to this report .			0
