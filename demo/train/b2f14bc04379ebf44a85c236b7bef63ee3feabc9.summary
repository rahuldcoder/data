its isolation lends @entity4 a bucolic serenity and has blessed it with an array of unique animals and plants			1
a third of @entity4 's 825 plant species , 90 % of its reptile species and 95 % of its land snail species do not occur anywhere else in the world , according to @entity26 , which added the archipelago to its @entity27 for its natural beauty			1
@entity30 photographer @entity29 had been fascinated by @entity4 since reading about it in a magazine , but he was led there by an old proverb			1
" i had a project that did n't work out and we have a proverb in @entity30 about being ' ready for the island ' if you are exhausted -- so i thought it was time to go to @entity4 , " he said			2
" i started looking up flights and applying for a visa straight away			0
" when @entity29 , 27 , finally made it there he was captivated by both the scenery and the people he met			2
" it blew my mind			0
it 's incredibly amazing and other - wordly , " he said			0
" the landscape is bizarre , with mountains , valleys that cut 600 meters into the landscape , moon - like desert plains and huge sand - dunes and endemic plants that are completely different from anything i 've seen			0
" the archipelago has four islands , of which one is uninhabited and two others have only 450 and 100 residents respectively			0
@entity29 visited only the main island , also called @entity4 , which covers an area of 3,625 square kilometers			1
he has published a book of photographs and the story of his travels , called " @entity4 , an island			1
" the tribal @entity70 people of @entity4 live mostly from goat herding , date plantations and fishing			2
the population of the islands is estimated at 44,000 , according to the @entity76 and @entity77 ( @entity78 )			0

also on inside the @entity89 : @entity91 's first female olympians @entity29 received hospitality from the @entity70 people of @entity4 , staying in their homes and eating with them , but said he was never quite able to bridge the cultural divide he felt			1
" i discovered i was alien to the people and they were alien to me , " he said			0
" they were extremely hospitable , they welcomed me in their houses and i had tea with the village elders , but there was an invisible world of extreme cultural difference			0
" @entity29 said he also witnessed the devastating impact of industrial fishing on the island 's small boats			2
" i was a guest of fishermen on the coast and there were days when they did n't catch anything so there was nothing to eat but yesterday 's bread , " he said			0
" they are often victim of pirate @entity119 fishing trawlers illegally depleting their stocks , because neither @entity10 nor ( nearby ) @entity121 has effective coast guard to stop them			1
" i realized for the first time what overfishing means			0
it 's not about running out of tuna in 10 years ' time , it means people will starve now because they do n't get their daily fish			0
