another day , another fight about reclining seats on a @entity3 airline flight			1
in the third serious airline legroom incident in two weeks , an angry passenger caused yet another flight to divert monday night			1
@entity7 from @entity9 's @entity8 to @entity10 , @entity11 , was rerouted to @entity12 , @entity11			1
a passenger became irate about the traveler in front of her trying to recline her seat , a fellow passenger told @entity20 affiliate @entity19			1
" this woman who was sitting next to me knitting actually just tried reclining her seat back , " passenger @entity21 said			1
" the woman behind her started screaming and swearing and then a flight attendant came over and that just exacerbated what was going on and then she demanded that the flight land			0
" @entity7 confirmed the diversion			1
" @entity7 flight 2370 from @entity8 to @entity10 was re-routed to @entity33 due to a passenger disruption , " @entity7 said in a statement			1
" out of an abundance of caution , the captain elected to divert to the closest airport			0
" local law enforcement removed the passenger and the flight continued to @entity10 , @entity7 said			1
it 's been a tense couple of weeks for passengers on both sides of the right - to - recline debate			1
another reportedly irate passenger caused a flight from @entity49 to @entity50 to divert to @entity51 on august 27 after someone allegedly tried to recline in front of him			2
@entity50 resident @entity54 , 60 , was charged in @entity3 federal court august 28 with interfering with an airline flight crew			2
interfering with flight crew members is a violation of federal law and carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison			0
( the passenger 's name has also been spelled " @entity65 " @entity54 in court documents			0
) a @entity67 flight from @entity68 , @entity69 , to @entity70 was diverted on august 24 after two passengers argued over one passenger 's use of a " @entity74 , " a device that blocks reclining			1
should the @entity74 be banned ? @entity77 was thrown and the passengers , both 48 , were removed from the flight in @entity80 , according to a federal law enforcement source , speaking on background			2
the passengers were not arrested			0
it seems at least one of the passengers was not completely satisfied with the extra space in the @entity89 section where they were seated , which provides @entity67 passengers up to 5 inches of extra legroom compared with standard coach seats			2
aviation blogger @entity93 is surprised there have n't been more incidents in the air as travelers face long security checkpoint lines at more crowded airports as well as less space and fewer amenities on planes			0
" as airlines try and squeeze as many seats into economy as possible , that decreases seat pitch which can be uncomfortable for someone like me , who is 5 ' 3 " , " wrote @entity93 via e-mail			2
" but imagine being a foot taller squeezed into that same space			0
it does n't help that the ( @entity114 ) does n't have an official rule on using ( seat - blocking devices ) , instead deferring to passengers and airlines			0
so i feel the situation will get worse before it gets better			0
" the core problem is definitely the airlines packing too many seats too close together into a tight space , said veteran flight attendant @entity126 , author of " @entity127 : tales of @entity129 , @entity130 , and @entity131 at 35,000 feet			0
" " that said , this does n't give anyone the right to act childish , " @entity126 wrote via e-mail			0
" to react in such a way that the crew feels the need to divert a flight to have a passenger removed is a really big deal			0
" what do you think of this recent spate of airline seat recline incidents ? please share in the comments section below .			1
