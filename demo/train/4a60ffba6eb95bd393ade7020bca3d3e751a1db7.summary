-- when agent @entity1 plunges into icy waters in the opening moments of the brisk and satisfying spy thriller " @entity4 , " the scene serves two purposes : to commemorate the superb and well - loved trilogy that came before , in which @entity10 , as the man called @entity9 , made his first appearance in " @entity12 , " fished out of the @entity13 with bullets in his back ; and to baptize @entity16 as the action - hero heir worthy of leading the franchise forward			1
@entity16 's @entity20 is a conflicted hero built to take advantage of the " @entity25 " star 's best qualities as an actor â € ” his default intensity , the way he conveys that complicated mental calculations are taking place under cover of watchful stillness , even underwater			1
director and co-writer @entity33 ( " @entity35 " ) has custom - tailored " @entity4 " for the present by opening up the narrative			1
unnerving scenes of backroom operations among shadowy governmental and private - enterprise types reveal the machinations of a much bigger , more nefarious tangle of players than previously imagined			1
there are mystery men running the country â € ” and , by remote control , the world			2
meanwhile , @entity1 is currently the agent in the crosshairs			2
to his handlers he 's only " no. 5 , " one of six experimental warriors chemically enhanced for use by the @entity56 in an operation called @entity59 â € ” sort of the 2.0 of the original trilogy 's @entity60			2
but now his masters ( led by an effectively steely @entity64 ) want to eradicate all evidence that @entity59 ever existed by destroying these six superagents			0
in desperation , he turns for help to the pharmaceutical scientist who " created " his enhanced capabilities ( @entity72 , a good choice , and from the looks of her , a good runner )			0
soon the two are sprinting for their lives together			0
like any story with ' @entity9 " in the title , this one scampers around the globe , with a big chunk of well - crafted showdown action set in teeming @entity84			0
@entity33 , who as a screenwriter has shaped the movie saga from the beginning , trades the wired rhythms established in the past two episodes by @entity90 for something more realistic and closer to the ground			0
@entity9 's legacy is in good hands			0
