@entity0 -- a new government report says there are now more than three quarters of a million names on the @entity8 government 's terrorist " watch list , " raising concerns the list may be becoming too large			1
sen. @entity11 , chairman of the @entity12 , is concerned about the list 's size			2
a @entity16 study out wednesday said the @entity18 's watch list contained approximately 755,000 names			1
but because many potential suspects have multiple names or aliases on the list , investigators are not certain how many distinct individuals are actually represented			1
officials at the @entity18 told @entity1 in september that the number of individuals on the list is about 300,000			2
sen. @entity11 , the chairman of the @entity12 , said the " sheer size " of the list raises concerns			0
@entity11 , @entity33 , said the list contains an even higher number of records than 755,000			0
" it contained 158,000 names including aliases in july 2004 , " @entity11 said during a hearing on the list			2
" that grew to 755,000 names by may of this year , and now stands at about 860,000 names just five months later			0
that 's nearly a 500 percent increase in three years			0
" @entity46 , a lawyer for the @entity47 , urged @entity48 to tighten its oversight of the process " before we all become suspects in the eyes of the @entity18			1
" overall , the @entity16 -- the investigative arm of @entity48 -- credited the @entity18 , which compiles the government 's unified watch list , for making improvements in the system and providing a reliable single coordination point for terrorist screening data			1
but found the government " has not finalized guidelines for using watch list records within ( key segments of ) the private sector			1
" the @entity16 report said government agencies had encountered individuals who were on the watch list about 53,000 times since the system was started in december 2003			1
that number includes repeat matches from the same individuals multiple times			0
most of the hits did not result in arrests because of a lack of sufficient evidence of any terrorist or criminal activity			0
but deputy assistant homeland security secretary @entity81 said that is only part of the picture			0
" with our current security layers , we have prevented thousands of dangerous people from entering the @entity8 , including individuals suspected of terrorism , murderers , rapists , drug smugglers and human traffickers , " @entity81 said			0
" in fiscal year 2007 , @entity94 and @entity95 alone encountered 5,953 positive watch list matches			2
" wednesday 's report comes on the heels of a @entity101 inspector - general 's report , which expressed concern about the quality of some of the data in the watch list , but noted continuing improvement in the system			1
@entity18 director @entity109 expressed particular satisfaction with the recent execution of a multi-agency agreement , which he said " provides a full and fair review of any watch list record that is the cause of an individual 's complaint			1
" @entity11 and sen. @entity117 , @entity118 , said they were concerned about a report that a @entity122 citizen with tuberculosis was able to cross the border into the @entity8 more than 20 times without being stopped			0
@entity81 attributed the problem to a complicated and unusual pattern in the man 's name combined with inaccurate birth date information			0

government report : three quarters of a million names on " watch list "
multiple names or aliases add to list 's *complexity* , @entity16 report says
@entity47 urged @entity48 to tighten its oversight of the name compiling process
