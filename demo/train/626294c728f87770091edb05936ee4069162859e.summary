@entity0 -- several members of @entity3 ripped attorney general @entity5 's decision friday to try five suspected 9/11 terrorists in civilian court			1
@entity5 was accused of risking @entity9 ' security by treating the suspects like " common criminals " with a right to greater constitutional protections than they would receive in a military trial			1
five @entity16 detainees with alleged ties to the september 11 , 2001 , attacks -- including confessed mastermind @entity19 -- will be tried in civilian court in @entity21 , @entity5 announced friday			1
" these terrorists planned and executed the mass murder of thousands of innocent @entity9			2
treating them like common criminals is unconscionable , " @entity25 sen. @entity24 said in a written statement			0
" the attacks of september 11th were an act of war			0
reverting to a pre- 9/11 approach to fighting terrorism and bringing these dangerous individuals onto @entity9 soil needlessly compromises the safety of all @entity9			0
" @entity24 asserted that @entity5 had irresponsibly put " political ideology ahead of the safety of the @entity9 people just to fulfill an ill - conceived campaign promise			0
" @entity42 rep. @entity41 , the top @entity43 on the @entity44 , said the decision meant @entity19 and the other defendants would be able to claim new protections , including @entity48 and @entity50 rights against unreasonable search and seizure			1
" bringing terrorists to @entity9 soil expands their constitutional rights and could result in shorter sentences , " @entity41 claimed in a statement			1
" @entity9 already gives terrorists more constitutional rights than any other country			1
the administration should not prioritize the rights of terrorists over the rights of @entity9 to be safe and secure , " he said			1
@entity41 argued that trying suspected terrorists in military commissions at @entity16 , @entity67 , is the " most appropriate venue and safest option for the @entity9 people			2
" he also said the public needed to be " reassured that no terrorist will ever be released into our communities			0
" sen. @entity76 , i - @entity75 , agreed with @entity41 that suspected terrorists ought to be tried by military commissions			2
" it is inconceivable that we would bring these alleged terrorists back to @entity21 for trial , to the scene of the carnage they created eight years ago , and give them a platform to mock the suffering of their victims and the victims ' families , and rally their followers to continue waging jihad against @entity9 , " he said in a statement			1
the september 11 terrorists " are war criminals , not common criminals , " he argued			2
they are " not @entity9 citizens entitled to all the constitutional rights @entity9 citizens have in our federal courts			2
" @entity76 argued that the updated military commission system recently signed into law by @entity104 " provides standards of due process and fairness that fully comply with the requirements established by the @entity109 and the @entity110			0
" some criticism also came from the @entity113 side of the aisle			0
moderate @entity116 sen. @entity115 said he is " very concerned about the wisdom " of holding civilian trials instead of military tribunals			1
" it will be disruptive , costly , and potentially counterproductive to try ( the suspected terrorists ) as criminals in our civilian courts , " he warned			2
critics of military commissions , however , offered strong praise for @entity5 's decision			2
@entity128 , the head of the @entity129 , called it " a huge victory for restoring due process and the rule of law , as well as repairing @entity9 's international standing , an essential part of ensuring our national security			1
" @entity128 argued that it would " have been an enormous blow to @entity9 values if we had tried these defendants in a ( military commission ) process riddled with legal problems			0
" trying the suspects at the @entity16 detention facility would have amounted to " a miscarriage of justice in sham proceedings , " @entity128 said			2
@entity128 criticized @entity5 's decision to try five other detainees -- including @entity151 , the alleged mastermind behind the 2000 bombing of the destroyer @entity154 -- by military commission			2
" @entity157 and again the federal courts have proven themselves capable of handling terrorism cases while protecting both @entity9 values and sensitive national security information			0
justice can only be served in our tried and true courts , " @entity128 said			2
rep. @entity164 , @entity165 - @entity21 , said he supports @entity5 's decision to hold a trial in the city that bore the brunt of the september 11 attacks			1
" any suggestion that our prosecutors and our law enforcement personnel are not up to the task of safely holding and successfully prosecuting terrorists on @entity9 soil is insulting and untrue , " @entity164 said in a written statement			0
" i invite any of my colleagues who say that they are afraid to bring detainees into the @entity9 to face trial to come to @entity21 and see how we handle them			1
" @entity164 said the families of the victims of the september 11 attacks deserve the opportunity " to see these trials and confront these defendants in open court			0
" independent @entity21 mayor @entity189 said he supported @entity5 's decision to hold a trial in the city that bore the brunt of the september 11 attacks			1
" it is fitting that 9/11 suspects face justice near the @entity196 where so many @entity21 were murdered , " he asserted in a statement			1
@entity189 said he told @entity5 that " @entity21 stands ready to assist the federal court in the administration of justice in any way necessary			1
" but rep. @entity201 , a @entity21 @entity43 who represents who parts of @entity203 , said holding terrorism trials in @entity21 could be a security threat			1
" we are already the top target of the world			0
... they only have to be lucky once , " said @entity201 , whose father was a @entity21 policeman			1
holding the trial in @entity21 would put too much strain on the police force , he said			1
" they can do as good a job as possible but there are already a thousand cops working on counterterrorism , and to add to that will be very difficult , " @entity201 said			0
he added that the trial could last for years			0
@entity201 , the former chairman of the @entity221 , said it is " morally and constitutionally " wrong to try terrorism suspects in civilian courts			0
" we are at war , " he said			0
" this is a war			0
" @entity201 also blasted the president for allowing @entity5 to make an announcement about a politically dicey national security issue , and for releasing it on a friday as @entity104 was " sneaking away to @entity233 as this is happening			0
" " it 's like there are two administrations , the @entity104 administration and the @entity5 administration , " @entity201 said			0
@entity241 sen. @entity240 , however , contended that the decision to hold a civilian trial for some suspected terrorists and a military trial for others sent " a mixed message about @entity9 's resolve in the fight against terrorism			1
" " if military tribunals are suitable for the terrorists who attacked our sailors aboard the @entity154 ... then military tribunals are certainly the right venue to try the @entity258 terrorists , including @entity19 , who murdered thousands of innocent civilians on september 11 , 2001 , " he said .			0
