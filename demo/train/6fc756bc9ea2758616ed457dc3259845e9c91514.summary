in unscheduled and unusually personal remarks , president @entity0 tried friday to explain why african - americans were upset about last week 's acquittal of @entity4 in the shooting death of @entity6 while lowering expectations for federal charges in the case			1
" @entity6 could have been me 35 years ago , " @entity0 told @entity11 reporters in a surprise appearance at the daily briefing			1
his remarks , which lasted about 20 minutes , escalated a nationwide debate on the verdict that has prompted protests , including some that turned violent			0
a @entity21 jury acquitted @entity4 last saturday in @entity6 's february 26 , 2012 , shooting death , inciting anger among many who considered the incident racially motivated murder			1
@entity0 issued a written statement on sunday , noting that the jury had spoken and urging calm and reflection			2
despite some calls for him to speak about the case , the nation 's first @entity31 - @entity31 president had made no further public comment until friday			1
speaking without a teleprompter , @entity0 noted a history of racial disparity in law as well as more nuanced social prejudice that contribute to " a lot of pain " in the @entity31 - @entity31 community over the verdict			1
" there are very few @entity31 - @entity31 men in this country who have not had the experience of being followed when they are shopping at a department store			2
that includes me , " the president said			0
" there are probably very few @entity31 - @entity31 men who have not had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars			2
that happens to me - at least before i was a senator , " he continued			0
read the full transcript of president @entity0 's remarks " there are very few african - americans who have not had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had the chance to get off			1
that happens often , " he said			0
saying he did n't intend to exaggerate those experiences , @entity0 added that they " inform how the @entity31 - @entity31 community interprets what happened one night in @entity21			1
" " the @entity31 - @entity31 community is also knowledgeable that there is a history of racial disparities in the application of our criminal laws , everything from the death penalty to enforcement of our drug laws , " he said			2
" and that ends up having an impact in terms of how people interpret the case			0
" african - americans feel the context of the @entity6 killing is little known or denied , " and that all contributes , i think , to a sense that if a white male teen was involved in the same kind of scenario that , from top to bottom , both the outcome and the aftermath might have been different , " @entity0 said			1
these cases usually matter for states at the same time , @entity0 responded to calls by civil rights groups for federal hate crimes charges to be filed against @entity4 by saying the @entity21 legal process had reached a verdict			1
" once the jury 's spoken , that 's how our system works , " the president said , later adding that while attorney general @entity120 was looking further at the case , those calling for federal charges must " have some clear expectations here			1
" in @entity127 , law enforcement and the criminal code are " traditionally done at the state and local levels , not at the federal level , " he said			0
on saturday , " @entity131 " vigils are scheduled outside federal buildings across the country by rev. @entity135 's @entity134			0
@entity135 called @entity0 's remarks friday " significant and much needed , " saying in a statement that the president " set a tone for both direct action and needed dialogue			1
" @entity6 's parents said they were " deeply honored and moved " that @entity0 spoke publicly about their son , saying the president 's comments " give us great strength at this time			1
" " @entity6 's life was cut short , but we hope that his legacy will make our communities a better place for generations to come , " said the statement by @entity149 and @entity150			2
" we applaud the president 's call to action to bring communities together to encourage an open and difficult dialogue			2
" however , some conservative commentators criticized @entity0 for what they called divisiveness by speaking as an @entity31 instead of representing the entire country			1
@entity164 , a @entity165 anchor , tweeted " race - baiter in chief			0
" @entity168 contrast : how comments sparked very different reactions @entity4 's defense team cited @entity0 's courage in addressing the case and its racial context , but said the facts showed their client acted in self - defense and the jury reached the proper verdict			1
" while we acknowledge the racial context of the case , we hope that the president was not suggesting that this case fits a pattern of racial disparity , because we strongly contend that it does not , " the lawyers said in a statement			2
a @entity11 official told @entity193 chief @entity11 correspondent @entity191 that @entity0 decided thursday night to make his public remarks after watching the reaction to the @entity4 verdict over the past week			1
the official , who spoke on condition of not being identified , said @entity0 talked to friends and family members about the verdict , and told his senior staff he wanted to speak publicly about it			1
his staff recommended that he make the remarks in the @entity11 briefing room , as opposed to an interview			0
in his remarks , @entity0 said demonstrations and other responses to the @entity4 verdict must be non-violent or they will dishonor what happened to @entity6 and his family			1
he outlined possible future steps , calling for the @entity212 , state governors and city mayors to work with law enforcement agencies " about training at the state and local levels in order to reduce the kind of mistrust in the system that sometimes currently exists			0
" for example , he noted that racial profiling legislation he pushed as a state senator in @entity226 helped police departments think about the issue and act more professionally , which helped build trust with communities they serve			0
stand your ground laws @entity0 also called for reconsideration of " stand your ground " self - defense laws in @entity21 and other states , that he said " may encourage the kinds of altercations and confrontations and tragedies that we saw in the @entity21 case , rather than diffuse potential altercations			1
" @entity135 and other civil rights leaders call for abolishing the " stand your ground " laws			0
" if we 're sending a message as a society in our communities that someone who is armed potentially has the right to use those firearms , even if there 's a way for them to exit from a situation , is that really going to be contributing to the kind of peace and security and order that we 'd like to see ? " @entity0 asked			2
protesters stand up to ' stand your ground , ' but laws likely here to stay to supporters of such laws , @entity0 said they should consider if the right to fight back with a gun would have applied to @entity6			1
" do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting mr. @entity4 , who had followed him in a car , because he felt threatened ? " the president said			2
" and if the answer to that question is at least ambiguous , then it seems to me that we might want to examine those kinds of laws			0
" while rejecting any " grand new federal program , " @entity0 also called for providing more support for @entity31 boys and young mans who disproportionately end up in prison or homicide victims			1
no national conversation however , he rejected calls for him to launch a national conversation on race , saying " i have n't seen that be particularly productive when , you know , politicians try to organize conversations			0
" his comment could have been a slap at his own response to the 2009 arrest of @entity31 university professor @entity296 by a white police officer responding to a report of a possible burglary at his @entity301 - area home			2
after coming under criticism for saying police acted stupidly , @entity0 later invited the @entity305 professor and the arresting officer for a beer at the @entity11			2
on friday , @entity0 instead endorsed " soul - searching " discussions in homes , churches and workplaces where people might be more honest about whether they were " wringing as much bias " out of themselves as possible			0
" as difficult and challenging as this whole episode has been for a lot of people , i do n't want us to lose sight that things are getting better , " the president concluded , making a reference to his daughters ' generation			0
" it does n't mean we 're in a post-racial society			0
it does n't mean that racism is eliminated , " he said			0
" but , you know , when i talk to @entity329 and @entity330 and i listen to their friends and i see them interact , they 're better than we are			0
they 're better than we were on these issues			0
and that 's true in every community that i 've visited all across the country			0
