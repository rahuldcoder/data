-- " what day is @entity1 ? " it was a simple question my colleague asked me a few weeks ago			1
i was startled , then a little horrified			2
i wondered how anyone could not know when @entity6 officially honors military veterans			1
when i was growing up , and even now , every day is @entity1			1
my dad was a veteran of @entity9 and three combat tours in @entity11			2
he never talked about his military service but it was the phantom of my childhood			2
he had an explosive temper and terrible nightmares			2
he drank too much and yelled even more			2
he never held a job for more than a year or two , if at all , and looking back now , i realize he must have suffered terribly			2
but he loved @entity6 , his kids and happy hours at the @entity19			0
he hated hippies , foreign cars and people who belittled the armed forces			0
red , white and blue were his favorite colors			0
he carried his service around in his heart , his mind and in the metal shrapnel scattered in his body until the day he died			1
for him , every day was @entity1 , because he lived his time at war in some way every day			1
it 's a family tradition			1
my father 's father fought in the trenches of @entity40 in @entity41 , my uncles served in @entity42 my brother @entity44 joined the @entity45 when he was 17 and now , 35 years later , he is still serving			1
although he does n't talk about his time in @entity47 and @entity48 , he , like my dad , carries his service in his heart and his mind			1
my brother always says his heroes are the @entity45 he lost in @entity47			0
to this day , he honors those men by staying in touch with their families and keeping their memories alive			1
every day will always be @entity1 for him			1
my niece @entity56 is a private in the @entity58			0
she joined straight out of high school			0
i dread the day when she , too , will come home from a far off land wounded on the inside or out , when @entity1 is every day for her , too			1
i am like most @entity6			0
i have never fought in a war , never smelled fear and ammunition in combat , never worried about being blown up by a roadside bomb			0
we need to remember those who fought for our country while we stayed safe , out of the crossfire			0
the @entity73 says there are 23 million living @entity6 veterans			1
they could be your co-workers , neighbors and friends			0
even if you do n't know anyone who has served in the armed forces , there are some small things you can do to let them know you appreciate their service			1
how you can help a veteran any day @entity86 - based @entity85 sponsors programs honoring veterans year - round with care packages that include handwritten letters			1
there are directions on their website			0
the group sends care packages to @entity98 hospitals , veterans nursing homes , veterans groups and other support organizations			1
you can also create your own care package for a @entity98			0
donations of magazines , coffee or cookies , new or gently used clothing and telephone cards are always welcome			0
contact your local @entity98 for more information on what 's needed in your community			2
according to the @entity98 , a little more than a fifth of the adult homeless population has served in the military			0
the @entity98 has a @entity116 for veterans who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless			2
the center provides free 24/7 access to trained counselors			0
call 1 - 877 - @entity122 ( 1 - 877 - 424 - 3838			0
) in @entity124 and other cities , some organizations are working to help @entity126			0
" veterans do n't always ask for help			1
there 's a lot of pride , " says @entity129 , executive director of @entity130 to @entity131 pathways works with @entity136 to identify veterans who need help and get them off the street			1
they do this by getting them into permanent housing and providing them with psychological help and other services			0
these are just a few ways to help make every day @entity1			1
there are so many more things you can do in your own community			0
not just on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month , but a daily armistice in our hearts .			2
