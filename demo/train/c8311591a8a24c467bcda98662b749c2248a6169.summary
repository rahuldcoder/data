@entity1 supporters of a bipartisan budget compromise that aims to prevent another shutdown moved close monday to securing the votes they need to clear a crucial upcoming test vote after several conservative @entity7 announced their support			1
while all the votes are not locked in , senators and aides in both parties said they expected to break a filibuster tuesday and that the budget would pass later this week			1
@entity15 of @entity16 , @entity17 of @entity18 and @entity19 of @entity20 joined four other @entity21 who had already said they will either support the bill or , at a minimum , vote in favor of critical procedural motions that require a supermajority of 60 votes to prevail			1
that should happen if most of the 55 members of the @entity31 caucus also vote yes , which is likely			2
sen. @entity33 of @entity20 , a retiring @entity7 who spent months attempting to negotiate a deficit deal with @entity31 , said he would vote in favor of the procedural motions but had n't decided what to do on final passage			2
@entity31 leadership aides said they expect to hold all their members on the budget , which was approved by the @entity40 last week overwhelmingly and is supported by the @entity40			1
but they acknowledged a few liberals might drop off because the deal does n't include an extension of unemployment benefits or a few moderate @entity31 might vote no because the deal does n't do enough to lower the deficit			2
right now no @entity47 has announced opposition			0
@entity50 @entity31 sen. @entity49 , a liberal , refused to say how she would vote			2
she kept her eyes fixed on the ground as reporters asked her several times about her position until the door to the @entity58 elevator she was in closed			0
sen. @entity59 , a centrist @entity47 of @entity60 , who is facing a difficult re-election fight , said she would vote for the procedural motions but remains undecided on the bill			1
another moderate , sen. @entity64 , @entity65 , who is also facing a tough re-election , said he would vote in favor of both			2
@entity17 , who was lobbied to support the bill by fellow @entity18 @entity7 rep. @entity7 , one the authors of the deal , said , " i just want to make sure we avoid any additional government @entity75 federal government does enough harm to our economy			1
we do n't ' need to add additional harm by this crisis management			0
in the end this is not the kind of deal i would want to see			0
i 'm sure it 's not the kind of deal @entity7 would want to produce			0
" @entity15 said in a statement that " sometimes the answer has to be yes			0
" " ultimately , his agreement upholds the principles conservatives stand for and , with @entity31 controlling the @entity40 and the @entity1 , it is the best we can hope for , " he said			1
if the budget clears the test vote , final passage is expected no later than thursday			1
@entity98 vote count : budget deal nearing @entity1 approval , but not there yet final congressional approval of the elusive budget agreement would mark a rare win for bipartisanship and a step up for a @entity107 infected with political dysfunction and held in low public esteem with midterm elections less than a year off			1
it would also avert another government shutdown like the one in october that @entity113 largely blamed on @entity107			1
" i think it would be outrageous to shut down the government and i 'm not going to do that to my constituents who i represent , " said sen. @entity114 , @entity115 , who has said he plans to vote for the bill			1
" i hope it will pass the @entity1 , " he said sunday on @entity98 's " @entity121			1
" other key @entity7 members most @entity7 senators , raising a variety of concerns , are expected to vote against the bill			1
" i 'm concerned we have once again kicked the can down now a long road , " said sen. @entity128 , @entity129 , who said he is undecided			0
" i 'm leaning strongly against it , " said sen. @entity133 , @entity134 , a veteran lawmaker who opposes some of the fees the bill raises			2
democrats wary , too while @entity31 are more likely to vote in favor of the bill , many have concerns			1
more liberal senators -- like @entity144 of @entity145 -- complained that an unemployment benefit extension was not included in the deal			0
" there 's over a million people now who can not find a job , out of work , and right at this time of year their unemployment insurance is being cut off , " @entity144 told @entity148 last week			0
" it 's really unconscionable			0
" budget deal struck the budget agreement , which was months in the making , eases spending caps for the next two fiscal years while softening the impact of across - the - board spending cuts , known as the sequester , on defense and nondefense programs			1
do n't expect @entity164 to totally change his tune current federal spending expires in mid-january , raising the possibility of another shutdown at that time if there 's not a new agreement in place to keep federal coffers filled			1
the strong vote in the @entity40 on the budget plan on thursday -- 332 - 94 -- brought a collective sigh of relief among supporters , who initially thought it would sail through the @entity1 , where bipartisanship has been more the norm than in the sharply divided @entity40			1
but after reading details of the agreement , many @entity21 -- including several in leadership positions -- came out against the bill			2
" i 'd really like to stay within the ( spending ) caps , " complained sen. @entity185 , @entity186			0
" this busts the caps and as a result i 'll vote against it			0
" " i believe it will do disproportionate harm to our military retirees , " said sen. @entity192 , @entity134 - @entity193 , in announcing his opposition			0
" we need to find a better way to save $ 6 billion than take it out of the hides of our retired veterans , " said sen. @entity200 , @entity201 , who said he would vote against the bill			2
@entity208 , @entity200 , and sen. @entity209 , @entity210 , sent a letter to their @entity1 colleagues urging them to oppose the bill over the reduction in military benefits			1
it was unclear if the emergence of the politically sensitive issue would increase opposition			0
one @entity220 said outside interest groups for service members and veterans were caught off guard by the provision in the agreement and were just now beginning to mobilize against it			0
sen. @entity228 , @entity229 , said he finds the military pension issue " bothersome " but remains undecided on how to vote			2
" i would n't say leaning yes or leaning no. i 'm very concerned about the package but i can also see the merits of a two - year deal			0
so i want the weekend to think about it , " he said			0
why the deal could happen the retiring first - term lawmaker predicted the bill will pass the @entity1 regardless of how he votes			1
midterm primaries , and 2016 the top @entity1 @entity7 , @entity240 , @entity241 , has hinted strongly he will vote against it			1
he cites the weakening of the budget sequester as a key complaint			0
the same is true for his top two lieutenants -- sen. @entity246 of @entity247 and sen. @entity248 of @entity249 -- both of whom have declared they will oppose the compromise			0
@entity253 and @entity246 are up for re-election and both face primary challenges from the right			0
that might explain some of their sensitivity to giving up on the budget cuts , which are very popular with conservative voters			2
three leading tea party - backed senators with 2016 presidential aspirations -- @entity266 of @entity267 , @entity268 of @entity247 , and @entity269 of @entity270 -- also have come out against it for similar reasons .			0

the @entity40 passed a compromise budget bill easily , sending it to the @entity1
@entity276 aims to avert another government shutdown as early as mid-january
it would also ease *unpopular* spending cuts to the military and other programs
some conservatives come out for the budget bill ahead of tuesday test vote
