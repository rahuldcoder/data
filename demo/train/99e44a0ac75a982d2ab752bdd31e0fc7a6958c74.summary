-- @entity2 club @entity1 and striker @entity3 are at odds over the club 's sponsorship deal with a finance company , according to the player 's agent			1
@entity3 , who terrorized opposition defenses when he moved to soccer 's @entity2 last year , has n't been included in @entity1 's squad for a pre-season tour of @entity14 , the team from @entity15 revealed on its website a muslim , @entity3 does n't want to don @entity1 's jersey -- according to his agent -- because the sponsor is @entity21 , which , as stated on its website , lends money with an annual interest rate of more than 5,800 percent			1
" he feels that it is immoral ...			0
, " the @entity27 international 's agent @entity25 told @entity0 , outlining his interpretation of the striker 's position			2
@entity25 declined @entity0 's request to interview @entity3			2
earlier this month @entity34 consumer watchdog which ? revealed a million families a month needed short - term high interest loans to get by			0
of those , 400,000 used the cash to pay for essentials such as food and fuel , while a further 240,000 needed money to pay off existing debts			0
@entity1 , which did not return calls from @entity0 seeking comment , has yet to explain why @entity3 did not travel with the squad to @entity14			1
under @entity51 law , making money from interest , for example , is n't allowed			1
but the @entity52 reported that two of @entity3 's @entity17 teammates , midfielders @entity56 and @entity57 , told the club they had no issue with wearing the shirt and both of them were included in the squad for the trip to @entity14 as the club prepare for the new @entity2 season which starts on august 17			1
the partnership between the club and @entity21 is said to be worth $ 38m over four years			2
@entity21 , which declined comment on the @entity3 case , launched its first website in 2007 and according to its website , " rapidly became one of the world 's most innovative credit providers			1
" for first - time users , loans of up to about $ 600 can be requested and @entity21 usually provides an answer , it says , in seconds			2
however , the interest such companies charge consumers has raised concerns among a number of @entity34 politicians			0
" urgent action is needed to grip the regulation of the payday loan industry , as the number of cases of misery and hardship are growing rapidly because of pressures on living standards and personal finance , " @entity89 mp , @entity90 's shadow treasury minister , told the @entity34 opposition party 's website in june			0
@entity3 wore @entity1 's jersey last season when it was sponsored by another finance company -- lender @entity105			1
" i guess it might be a question of people 's views changing over time , " @entity106 , assistant secretary general with the @entity107 , told @entity0			0
" maybe they 've not had a chance to think things through beforehand			0
maybe now they realize , " added @entity106 in response to the question as to why @entity3 wore a virgin jersey but not the @entity21 one			1
@entity3 would n't be the first @entity17 player to refuse to wear a jersey on religious grounds			1
striker @entity122 took a stand at @entity125 's @entity124 in 2006 when he opted against wearing a shirt sponsored by gambling firm 888.com			1
eventually , @entity122 did wear the shirt but was excluded from taking part in any promotional activities linked to the sponsorship			2
" i think every player will have their own ( stance ) on this , " said @entity106			0
" there will be players who will not be prepared to do something they believe is against their religious teaching and there might be some who might not be so concerned			0
" it 's very difficult to say how everyone is going to react			0
" @entity145 has n't been approached by the club or @entity3 , @entity106 added			1
" if they were to make a request or approach , we would either signpost them or be able to give them advice , " he said			0
the chief executive of the @entity156 @entity155 -- who is seeking a resolution to the dispute -- did not respond to @entity0 's request for an interview			0
when asked if other clubs had expressed an interest in @entity3 , @entity25 could n't " answer that question			1
" earlier he insisted that @entity3 " loves the fans , the club and the city			2
" @entity3 played a significant role in helping @entity1 to overachieve and finish fifth in the @entity2 in 2011/2012 , scoring 13 goals in 14 appearances after joining from @entity170 for $ 13.7 million during the january transfer window			1
but he cooled last term , netting eight league goals as he played second fiddle to @entity175			0
@entity175 was then sold to @entity176 and @entity1 barely avoided relegation			2
the @entity3 saga has added to an already lively off - season at @entity1 , one of @entity183 's best supported clubs with an average league attendance last season of more than 50,000			1
in june , the @entity185 rehired the outspoken @entity186 , which did not go down well with the club 's fans			0
