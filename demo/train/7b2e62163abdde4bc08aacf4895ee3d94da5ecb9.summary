@entity0 -- the @entity2 could act as early as friday on pending requests for injunctions in two separate , high - profile cases -- health care reform and same - sex marriage -- that put justice @entity8 in an unusually pivotal role			1
religious - affiliated non-profits -- including a @entity12 - based home for the elderly run by @entity15 nuns -- have asked the high court to block enforcement of the requirement in the @entity19 to provide birth control and other reproductive health coverage to their workers			1
the emergency application was filed tuesday with @entity8 , a day before it was set to take effect			2
she issued a temporary stay , at least until the @entity28 administration could file a legal response			0
@entity2 to take up contraception case that deadline is friday at 10 a.m. et. the @entity15 - affiliated groups would have the option of submitting a final rebuttal before the court acts			2
@entity19 challenge the appeal again thrusts the politically charged @entity19 , also known as @entity19 , into the national legal spotlight			2
president @entity28 's signature domestic initiative , ruled constitutional by the court in 2012 , became even more controversial this past fall during its flawed public rollout			2
the current case spotlights a major sticking point in the law over contraception coverage			2
the mandate was designed by the administration to give women employed at nonprofit , religious - based organizations -- such as certain hospitals and private faith - based universities -- the ability to receive contraception through separate health policies with no co-pay			0
a court ruling on this matter could ultimately impact dozens of religious groups and businesses that have mounted legal challenges in recent months			0
the @entity61 has said the birth control requirement is lawful and " essential to a woman 's health			0
" the @entity2 in march will take up a related challenge to the birth control mandate , when it hears arguments over whether some for - profit corporations should be exempt , again on religious liberty grounds			0
@entity70 asks @entity2 to block same - sex marriage same - sex marriage @entity8 is also taking the lead in a separate appeal involving @entity70 's law banning gays and lesbians from legal wedlock			1
a federal judge struck down the statute as unconstitutional on december 20 , and the state then asked the high court to block -- at least temporarily -- enforcement of the judge 's ruling			1
she has not yet acted on the state 's request , but gave lawyers for a coalition of same - sex couples until friday at noon et to file a legal response			1
again , the state could submit a final rebuttal , and then the court would decide			0
an order could come as soon as that afternoon			0
in the @entity70 case , @entity96 district judge @entity95 said the state 's law " conflicts with the @entity100 's guarantees of equal protection and due process under the law			1
" the issue on enforcement is tricky since hundreds of marriage licenses have already been issued by some @entity70 counties in the nearly two weeks since the decision was announced			1
voters there approved a law banning same - sex marriage in 2004			1
any action from the high court on the enforcement question would be temporary and not offer the final word on the constitutionality of the state 's ban on same - sex marriage			1
a @entity12 - based federal appeals court will take up the larger issues on an expedited basis in coming weeks , but in the meantime has allowed those marriages to continue			0
the state argued tuesday in its high court appeal that " as a result of the district court 's injunction , numerous same - sex marriages are now occurring every day in @entity70			1
and each one is an affront ... to the interests of the states and its citizens in being able to define marriage through ordinary democratic channels			0
" @entity8 on hot seat why is @entity8 the point person for these two hot - button emergency appeals ? the simple answer is : location			1
one of the duties of the individual justices is to handle " applications " -- time - sensitive appeals , such as requests for an injunction against some government mandate , or a stay of execution			0
each justice is assigned a particular " circuit " -- a region of the country or judicial jurisdiction -- to handle these applications			0
so @entity8 deals with the @entity160 , which includes @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity70 , @entity163 , @entity164 , and @entity165			1
her chambers were given separate heads - ups tuesday by both the state of @entity70 and by lawyers for a @entity161 - based religious - affiliated group that the appeals would be coming , so she was prepared to act			1
@entity8 has the discretion of deciding these kinds of appeals herself , or she can ask the entire court to weigh in			2
there is no specific deadline for her or the court as a whole to act , but they are generally handled relatively quickly			0
but any decision from the high court at this stage would be limited in nature , dealing only with whether to block enforcement temporarily , until the larger legal and constitutional issues work their way fully through the various federal courts in both the marriage and healthcare cases			2
the marriage case is @entity193 ( @entity194 )			0
the health care case is @entity196 v. @entity197 ( @entity198 ) .			0

two requests for *injuctions* puts @entity8 in unusually pivotal role
@entity8 blocked part of @entity19 law that required contraceptive coverage
@entity70 is asking court to block judge 's ruling that struck down ban on same - sex marriage
