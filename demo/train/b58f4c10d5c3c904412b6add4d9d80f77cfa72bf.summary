@entity0 -- in an election year that some pundits have predicted will be focused on jobs and the economy , social issues like same - sex marriage have stolen the spotlight a surprising number of times			1
but experts say do n't expect those hot - button topics to be the ultimate markers of the 2012 cycle			2
on wednesday , president @entity15 officially came out in support of the right of @entity18 to marry same - sex partners , ending a streak of ambiguity over his position that has long perplexed supporters of marriage equality			1
" i 've just concluded that for me , personally , it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that i think same - sex couples should be able to get married , " @entity15 told @entity25			1
his now - evolved statement came one day after @entity29 became the latest @entity31 state to pass an amendment banning same sex - marriage and domestic partnerships			1
@entity15 's campaign issued a statement last month opposing the amendment			1
but pressure had grown on the @entity39 to go further after vice president @entity40 said sunday , in response to a question on a talk show , that he was " absolutely comfortable " with same sex - marriage			1
@entity15 had said only that his position was " evolving " after having once opposed same - sex marriage			1
on monday , education secretary @entity46 also showed support for same - sex marriage			1
marriage - equality advocates quickly pounced on the statement , ramping up pressure on @entity15 to do so as well			1
" standing up for the freedom to marry is not just the right thing to do , it 's the right thing politically , and it 's time for the president to stand on the right side of history , " said @entity51 , president of @entity52 , an advocacy group			2
political observers say the president was simply playing smart politics			0
with a @entity65 poll showing the country is split over the issue -- 50 % of voters support the practice , while 48 % oppose -- @entity15 had a fine line to walk in terms of political impact			2
opinion : @entity15 's most courageous moment " while this president can point to successes in advancing gay civil rights , much more than i think any other president , that final step ( of endorsing same - sex marriage ) would leave him open to a series of negative attacks that could really alienate swing voters , " @entity1 political contributor @entity75 said tuesday , before the president made his statement			1
several other states are dealing with the issue this year			0
@entity0 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 have passed or are poised to pass legislation in favor of same - sex marriage , while @entity95 will vote on a ballot initiative similar to @entity29 's			1
analysts say the move could prove to be risky for the president this fall , especially in key swing states like @entity101 , @entity29 and @entity102 , which have strong conservative bases and demographics that might take issue with the president 's stance			2
" it 's going to have some political cost for him , " predicted @entity108 , a @entity109 strategist and @entity1 contributor			0
" he will lose some @entity114 , the cultural blue - collar @entity114 in states like @entity117 and @entity29 and @entity118 -- important swing states			0
" opinion : support for same - sex marriage growing in @entity109 but some argue the move was a bold one , which could poll well among independents looking for " conviction " in the @entity39			1
" you 'll never agree with everybody on every issue , but now he 's taken the position that is clearly in his heart , " @entity128 , a senior adviser for the pro-obama super @entity129 , told @entity1			2
" people admire a ' conviction politician , ' and i think he can stand proud on that			0
" presumptive @entity109 presidential nominee @entity139 reiterated his position on the issue after @entity15 's interview on wednesday , drawing a stark contrast with that of the president			1
" my view is that marriage itself is a relationship between a man and a woman , and that 's my own preference , " he told reporters in @entity147			2
" i know other people have differing views			0
" in an interview earlier in the day , he said he supported domestic partnership benefits and hospital visitation rights for same - sex couples			2
however , in the past , @entity139 has expressed support for a federal amendment banning gay marriage and has said that he , unlike @entity15 , would defend the @entity163 , which defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman			2
this is n't the first time a social issue has appeared front and center this cycle			0
in february , the @entity15 administration 's so - called contraception mandate sparked a wave of opposition from @entity109 , who decried a requirement that institutions affiliated with religions include contraception coverage in their health care plans			2
@entity182 : what 's your take on this issue ? the outcry ultimately influenced the administration to amend its proposal so that insurance companies , not the institutions , would pay for contraception coverage			0
that episode was part of a larger @entity195 - led narrative that paints the @entity109 as waging a " war on women			0
" as another example , democrats point to a bill recently signed by @entity102 gov. @entity200 that requires any woman desiring to undergo an abortion to first be given an ultrasound test			0
hitting back , @entity109 seized on comments made by @entity195 strategist @entity205 , who last month criticized @entity206 for having " never worked a day in her life " as a stay - at - home mother			0
the @entity109 argued her comments reflected a cultural bias among @entity195 against @entity109			0
but will same - sex marriage prove to be a key issue in the presidential election ? with a number of states voting this year on the issue , experts say it will probably make a few more headlines but will unlikely be the biggest issue of 2012			1
the fact that @entity29 , a traditionally conservative state , voted to pass the amendment is no surprise and indicates little about voters ' attitudes on same - sex marriage , said professor @entity228 of @entity229			1
but if social issues do play a prominent role this cycle , @entity15 would come out ahead in the resulting debate , said @entity228 , who has done extensive research on the legal implications of same - sex marriage			1
" people who feel most strongly about same - sex marriage are either strong @entity195 or strong @entity109 , " he said			1
" the people who could go either way are people who are worried about the economy			0
if the economy does not look like the winner for @entity139 , it 's hard to imagine him pulling it out with this			0
" @entity228 said @entity15 's support for same - sex marriage will likely energize his base -- but he added that the statement is about all the president can do in terms of affecting the issue			1
" ultimately , it 's up to the courts to decide , " he said			0
" really , all that he can do is try to be an opinion leader here			0
he has n't got any real power			0
" a @entity258 survey in april showed same - sex marriage to be low on voters ' minds , with the issue coming in dead last out of the 18 topics listed			1
only 28 % of voters described it as a " very important issue " this election year			0
@entity268 , legal director at the @entity269 , which studies sexual orientation , law and public policy at @entity273 , said she would be surprised if the issue comes into play this fall , despite its appearance on states ' ballots and the president 's changed position			2
" i suspect the issue might have played some role in @entity29 , which will be contested , " she told @entity1 in an e-mail			0
" but with the marriage vote having happened just now , it seems unlikely to still be much on voters ' minds six months from now			0
" she added that @entity15 's comments may fuel ongoing discussion among pundits and politicos , but doubts voters will view the issue as a highly important one this fall			1
" the overwhelming majority of @entity18 already enjoy the right to marry the person they wish to marry , and are not directly affected by laws prohibiting same - sex couples from marrying , " she said			2
" those laws just do n't affect their families , let alone their jobs , their children 's schools , or whether they are able to take loved ones to the doctor			0

experts say they do n't think same - sex marriage to be a deciding issue in *november*
