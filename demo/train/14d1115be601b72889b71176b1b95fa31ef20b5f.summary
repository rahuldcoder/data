" the visit is important to boost his stature at home -- here is the man the @entity9 takes seriously , and he can deal with them on our behalf , " says @entity14 , a @entity5 expert at the @entity15			1
" for the @entity9 , it provides an opportunity to introduce him to key @entity9 politicians and the @entity9 public			2
the same approach was taken with @entity30 before he took over			2
" @entity7 , 58 , is in line to be @entity5 's next paramount leader			1
he is expected to succeed @entity30 when his second term ends in autumn this year and could rule @entity5 for 10 years			1
but who is @entity7 ? some key information about him : he comes from a clique known as " princelings , " sons and daughters of revolutionary veterans			2
his father , @entity40 , was a revolutionary hero who was banished during the @entity41			0
when his father was in limbo , @entity7 spent time as a teenager doing manual labor in @entity5 's countryside and went on to become a local party chief			1
he holds chemical engineering and law degrees from the prestigious @entity52 , the alma mater of @entity30 and other senior leaders			2
he served in the @entity53 as an officer in the @entity55 and assistant to the chief of the policy - making @entity58			0
he worked his way up from party chief to governor or party chief of three provinces -- @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			0
he became party chief of @entity67 in 2007 to replace @entity69 , who was sacked because of a corruption scandal			0

what makes @entity7 click ? analysts say @entity7 is generally liked for his pragmatism , competence and a heritage of political reliability			2
" he has avoided controversy in his career and has worked in provinces that could be deemed a success , " @entity14 said			0
" he appeals to the broadest range of factions within the party , he is one of them , and he is not going to upset their privileges			0
" " his ' birthmark ' is obviously a factor that propelled him to the top , " says @entity102 , a @entity5 - watcher at the @entity103 in @entity104			1
@entity102 also notes that @entity7 is generally perceived as " unassuming and unpretentious			2
" @entity109 's retired leader @entity108 recalled a one - hour meeting in late 2007 and found @entity7 to be a thoughtful man who has been through many trials in life			1
" i would put him in the @entity114 's class of persons , a person with enormous emotional stability who does not allow his personal misfortunes or sufferings to affect his judgment			0
in other words , he is impressive			0
" what kind of a leader might @entity7 be as a driver of @entity5 's foreign policy ? will he be dovish or hawkish ? " most see him , given his previous work experience , as likely to be on the collaborative side , " @entity14 said			1
" people who know him say he is thoughtful and wants a good relationship with the @entity9 his daughter is here , his sister is in @entity133			0
" however , given the strong nationalistic sentiments in the military and among sections of the youth , @entity14 thinks " it might make him feel that he has to be aggressive , at least to start with , to consolidate his position			0

@entity164 is actually known about @entity7 's political views , but analysts say he shares concerns about maintaining the rule of the communist party and social stability			1
recent ethnic unrest in @entity172 and @entity173 , strikes in factories and mass protests in towns and villages have made @entity5 far cry from @entity30 's dream of a " harmonious society			1
" the rapid economic growth the leadership has depended on to claim political legitimacy and to ease social tensions has been sputtering as key export markets in the @entity9 and @entity185 continue to shrink			2

@entity14 believes @entity7 's biggest challenge is how to deal with the new social media , given the divergent opinions within the @entity201			1
" some want to treat it like the old - fashioned print media and try to mimic the same kinds of controls and institutional structures , " he explained			0
" others recognize the world is changing and that a new way of dealing with the social media and citizen participation has to be found without undermining the party 's paramount position			1
" " this challenge is fundamental to the future of the party , " @entity14 added			0
" do n't expect too much change from @entity7 , " said " @entity220 , " a microblogger posting on @entity222 , a social media site in @entity5			1
" @entity223 " writes : " i do n't really expect the @entity201 to start holding general elections , but i do hope @entity7 can bring some substantial reform to keep the despotic ' people 's servants ' within limits ... i want to at least have the right to remove someone from office when i do n't want him there			2
" perhaps @entity7 can pick up pointers , good and bad , when he visits the @entity9 .			1

the 58 - year - old is in line to be @entity5 's next paramount leader after @entity30
