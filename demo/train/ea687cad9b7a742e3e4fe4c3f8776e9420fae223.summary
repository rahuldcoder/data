-- just when it looked like the @entity4 " dark horses " were about to turn up lame , @entity1 turned on the power in the final straight to overcome @entity7 2 - 1 in @entity8			1
trailing to @entity10 's first - half penalty , @entity1 , tipped by many to reach the later stages of the tournament , hit back in impressive fashion			1
@entity15 , derided for much of the season following a nightmare year at @entity17 , headed home an equalizer with 20 minutes remaining after entering the fray as a substitute			1
and @entity1 sealed victory with 10 minutes left when @entity23 rounded off a stylish counter-attack to snatch victory			1
much has been made of @entity27 ' side as the tournament 's " dark horses " even if this is a nation which has not qualified for the @entity4 since 2002			0
while the talent at @entity27 ' disposal can not be questioned , the side 's ability to cope with the pressure on the world 's biggest stage remained something of a mystery			0
for the past year , since @entity1 clinched its place at the @entity4 , experts have lined up to lavish praise on the country 's " golden generation			1
" it 's generation of players , woven together from the country 's immigrant communities , has brought about a new sense of unity within @entity1			1
its captain , @entity51 , was born in @entity53 to parents of @entity56 descent , while @entity57 , the striker , comes from a similar background			0
the likes of @entity15 and @entity60 have @entity62 heritage , while @entity63 , the precociously talented @entity17 player , has @entity65 and @entity66 blood			1
even so , while @entity1 boasts undoubted talent , its players have hardly excelled in @entity71 competition this year			1
while goalkeeper @entity73 enjoyed a stellar season with @entity75 , winning the @entity77 title and finishing second in the @entity79 , and @entity51 won the @entity80 with @entity81 , their compatriots have not been so fortunate			0
@entity83 's @entity82 has spent most of the year as a substitute , while @entity15 has become a figure of fun following a number of disappointing displays at club level			2
then there is the @entity92 triumvirate of @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 , all of whom have struggled for consistency in the @entity80			0
add to that the absence of injured @entity101 striker @entity100 and the fitness doubts surrounding @entity57 , and it 's easy to see why the hype soon began to cloud the reality			0
nonetheless , @entity1 was still expected to deal with an @entity7 side which has been widely dismissed by fans and pundits alike			1
but in @entity10 , @entity7 has a player who can mix it with the very best			2
the 24 - year - old , born in @entity112 , represented the country of his birth at under - 18 and under - 21 level but never managed to make the step up to the first team			0
now at @entity77 club @entity118 , @entity10 has begun to attract the attention his talent deserves and this latest performance would have done his reputation no harm at all			0
his strike , which came from the penalty spot after 24 minutes , might have sealed a historic win for an @entity7 side which has never qualified from the group stage in its past three attempts			2
the goal came following a moment of madness from @entity133 , who pulled @entity10 to the ground when a calm head was needed			0
ranked 22nd in the world , @entity7 is @entity139 's top team according to @entity140 -- and while it struggled to pose much of an attacking threat , it looked relatively untroubled by the @entity142			2
a halftime lead was no less than it deserved following a resilient display in which the defense coped admirably with its opponents			0
@entity1 , blessed with an array of attacking talent , looked stumped in its attempts to open up the @entity151 defense			2
it was n't until the 66th minute that it created a real opportunity when @entity153 , on as substitute for the disappointing @entity57 , fired straight at the @entity7 goalkeeper			2
but @entity1 did eventually pull level when @entity15 , fresh from entering the action just minutes earlier , headed home @entity159 's cross to spark relief			1
suddenly , the @entity162 appeared a different proposition and there was a sense of inevitability when @entity23 ran clear to fire home the winner with 10 minutes remaining			2
@entity15 almost added a third when his header was brilliantly tipped over the crossbar by @entity170			0
@entity1 's next game is against @entity172 on june 22 while @entity7 takes on @entity173 later that day			1
@entity172 1 - 1 @entity173 in the group 's late game , @entity172 came from behind to snatch a point against @entity173 in @entity177			1
substitute @entity178 netted a 74th minute equalizer to spare the blushes of his goalkeeper @entity181			1
it was @entity181 's dreadful error which allowed @entity185 's 25 - yard effort to somehow squirm out of his hands and over the line			0
for @entity189 , the @entity172 coach , it must have felt like @entity190			0
four years ago , @entity189 , then in charge of @entity192 , watched on in horror as goalkeeper @entity194 allowed an effort to roll underneath his body during a 1 - 1 draw with the @entity198 fortunately for @entity172 , @entity178 's strike ensured @entity172 avoided defeat after falling behind with 22 minutes remaining			1
both teams pushed forward in search of a winner but were unable to find the goal they so badly craved			0
