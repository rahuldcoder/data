@entity0 -- a @entity3 judge rejected wednesday a request to reduce the $ 23 million bail of a former elementary school teacher charged with 23 counts of lewd acts upon students			1
judge @entity10 also rejected a request by the public defender for former teacher @entity13 to view prosecution photographs of other schoolchildren whom authorities are investigating as possible additional victims			1
@entity19 , 61 , who taught at the @entity0 school district 's @entity13 , pleaded not guilty in february to allegations he bound young students , then photographed them with semen - filled spoons held at their mouths and three - inch cockroaches crawling across their faces , among other graphic depictions			1
in rejecting public defender @entity29 's request to reduce bail to $ 1 million , @entity10 said in court there was " evidence of emotional trauma in that some of the children have experienced unspecified nightmares			1
" the judge said she weighed " the sophistication of the offenses and the alleged injuries to the victims , " the allegation of " the exchange of bodily fluids , " and the defendant 's position of trust with " particularly vulnerable " victims in making her decision			2
@entity29 argued the $ 23 million , $ 1 million for each of the 23 offenses , was unconstitutional because " that 's the functional equivalent of no bail			1
" @entity19 , wearing an orange jumpsuit , was seated beside his attorney during the hearing			2
@entity29 also argued that @entity19 has no criminal record , is not a flight risk , and had taught at @entity13 for more than 30 years			1
after the hearing , @entity29 told reporters he was disappointed the judge declined to reduce @entity19 's bail			1
" mr. @entity19 would n't even be able to go out of his home " if he were released on bail because of the case 's widespread publicity , he said			2
@entity29 also expressed concerns about the judge 's courtroom remarks about the victims ' nightmares , saying the comment could hurt his case			2
" that 's news to me , " @entity29 said			0
" who has been feeding these kids information " of what was allegedly occurring in the photographs ? meanwhile , @entity3 authorities have transferred @entity19 to another detention facility after @entity29 complained in february that jailers identified @entity19 as a child molester on the jail 's speaker system			1
the @entity3 sheriff has already ordered an internal affairs investigation of the complaint , and the administrative review is ongoing , spokesman @entity86 said wednesday			0
jail supervisors have said they were unaware of the incident , @entity86 said			0
@entity19 is still experiencing harassment from other inmates after the relocation , @entity29 said			2
the next court date is may 1 to schedule @entity19 's preliminary hearing , the judge said			1
meanwhile , the @entity100 state auditor is going to carry out an emergency $ 300,000 audit of the @entity13 's negligence in managing and documenting child abuse claims , said state assemblyman @entity104 , @entity105 , who sponsored the performance audit proposal			1
the incident at @entity13 and similar allegations of child sex abuse at other @entity0 public schools prompted the audit , @entity107 said			1
the audit should be complete in seven to nine months , @entity107 said			0
dismissed by the @entity13 school board about a year ago , @entity19 was arrested january 30			2
he appeared in court two days later , after which he was ordered held on $ 23 million bail			1
all the initial 23 victims were between 7 and 10 years old , and all but two of them were girls , the @entity118 's @entity117 said			2
authorities have said they have discovered roughly 600 images allegedly taken by @entity19 in his classroom			0
since @entity19 's initial appearance , @entity125 spokesman sgt. @entity124 said an additional 200 photographs purportedly taken by @entity19 have been found			1
it is uncertain what , if any , additional charges @entity19 may face as a result of that discovery or other developments in the investigation			0
the law enforcement investigation began when investigators found " over 40 photographs depicting children in a school classroom , with their eyes blindfolded and mouths covered with tape , " a @entity125 's statement said			0
" investigators learned that some of the photos depicted suspect @entity13 with his arm around the children , or with his hand over their mouths , " according to the sheriff 's department			2
some photos showed " children with large live @entity156 - type cockroaches on their faces and mouths			0
" others show female students with " what appeared to be a blue plastic spoon , filled with an unknown clear / white liquid substance , up to their mouths as if they were going to ingest the substance , " said the sheriff 's department			0
@entity124 said that @entity19 was arrested soon after lab testing matched @entity19 's dna with a substance , later determined to be semen , from a blue plastic spoon and an empty container from a trash bin in his classroom			1
the young students " did n't realize they were victimized , " said the sheriff 's department spokesman			0
" they thought they were being blindfolded and gagged as a game , " @entity124 added			0
" and they were rewarded with cookies or spoons full of sugar , ( but ) they did not realize the spoon contained semen			0
" a search of @entity19 's home found hundreds of photographs depicting children and a video showing sexual bondage activity that " mirrored the bondage - type photos of the children , " investigators said			1
@entity200 superintendent @entity199 said @entity19 was removed from his teaching job in january 2011 after school officials learned of the police investigation			0
a teacher for 30 years , @entity19 initially challenged the school district 's decision to dismiss him			2
but he eventually dropped his appeal and resigned last spring			0
his arrest in january precipitated a broader fallout over the adequacy of safeguards for the school 's students and the prospect of more victims			0
days after @entity19 was taken into custody , another @entity13 teacher -- @entity13 , 49 -- was arrested and charged with three felony counts of lewd acts with a girl under age 14			1
he has pleaded not guilty			0
the school board subsequently shut @entity13 for two days , during which the board reconstituted the entire staff in the 1,400 - student school			0
@entity13 is in unincorporated @entity3 within the @entity228 area , about 6 miles south of downtown @entity0			1
