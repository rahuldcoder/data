-- there 's a good chance you never knew you needed to witness the sight of an angry ape charging on horseback , double - fisting a pair of machine guns			2
but trust me , you do			0
although @entity9 might disagree , that showstopping sequence of lead - spraying primate mayhem is just one of the many giddy pleasures in @entity15 ' surprisingly rollicking and resonant " @entity16 " â € ” a sequel that easily tops its 2011 predecessor			1
picking up 10 incident - stuffed years after the @entity19 - led first film left off , " @entity23 " sets the stage as most post-apocalyptic movies do nowadays : with a helter - skelter montage of dire news reports informing us that humanity has been nearly decimated by a virulent strain of simian flu , and that cities such as @entity31 , where the film is set , have been reduced to overgrown piles of rubble and ruin			2
@entity36 : @entity37 , @entity38 and ' @entity16 ' but while @entity41 's human population is n't doing so hot , the apes are thriving			1
@entity38 , the cute chimp raised by @entity19 in the franchise opener , is now the wise and benevolent leader of his species			1
he and his gang all live in @entity47 just north of the city , where they 've not only learned to read , write , and speak ( @entity50 , naturally ) , they 've also nurtured a healthy distrust of humankind			0
that 's probably smart , considering that the humans have crowned a @entity38 of their own ( actually , more like a @entity55 ) in @entity57 's @entity56 , a tin - badge fascist whose mantra seems to be " the only good ape is a dead ape			1
" needing electricity to power their shantytown , @entity57 dispatches a group of outdoorsy human ambassadors ( including the chimp - athetic @entity66 and @entity67 ) to strike a deal with @entity38 to let them repair a hydroelectric dam on ape turf			1
@entity71 : @entity73 's most bankable invisible actor wariness on both sides leads to betrayal and war , and the movie 's off to the @entity79 - toting - ape - on - horseback races			2
@entity15 , whose previous films " @entity81 " and " @entity82 " were stronger on promise than payoff , stages these battles with amazing technical skill and a real painter 's eye			0
his images , as undeniably silly as they are , are so striking they stick with you â € ” especially a beaut in which a ticked - off ape mans the rat - a - tat turret of a tank			2
if only as much care were put into the film 's human characters			1
@entity57 nearly pops a hernia from hamming it up so hard , and @entity66 's melancholy eyes are so perpetually moist in his admiration of the apes , you want to offer a tissue			0
the one truly great performance belongs to @entity71 , whose @entity38 is his most soulful motion - capture creation yet			1
despite all the obscuring layers of digital trickery , the actor manages to convey an impressive physicality and array of emotions , from hope to grief to rage			0
i wo n't spoil which side wins the interspecies showdown , but when it comes to who does the better acting , the apes carry the day , ( hairy ) hands down			0
