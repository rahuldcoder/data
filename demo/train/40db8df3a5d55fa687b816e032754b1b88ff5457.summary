-- former @entity2 rep. @entity1 of @entity3 , whose support for @entity6 forces in @entity7 inspired the 2007 movie " @entity9 , " died wednesday at age 76			1
the 12 - term congressman , who served the state 's second congressional district , had been in a meeting wednesday morning with a friend when he complained of difficulty breathing , said @entity17 , a spokeswoman for @entity18 in @entity19			1
the two men were heading to the hospital when they passed an emergency medical services vehicle on the side of the road and stopped for help , she said			2
paramedics took @entity1 to the hospital emergency room , where he was pronounced dead , she said			1
@entity1 , who had undergone a heart transplant at @entity30 in @entity31 in september 2007 , moved back to @entity19 when he retired from @entity32 in 1997 after having served since 1973 , she said			1
" i had the unforgettable experience of knowing congressman @entity1 when i was at @entity36 and he was working tirelessly on behalf of the @entity7 resistance fighting the @entity38 , " said defense secretary @entity33 in a written statement			1
" as the world now knows , his efforts and exploits helped repel an invader , liberate a people and bring the @entity44 to a close			0
after the @entity38 left , @entity46 kept fighting for the @entity7 people and warned against abandoning that traumatized country to its fate -- a warning we should have heeded then , and should remember today			0
" " @entity1 led a life that was oversized even by @entity56 's standards , " said @entity3 gov. @entity52 in a statement			1
" congressman @entity1 was fiercely devoted to serving his country and his fellow @entity58			1
" " @entity46 was a man of courage and conviction who worked hard , loved his country , and lived life to the fullest , " said @entity60 chairman @entity59 , @entity61			0
" we will miss him			0
" @entity68 portrayed the flamboyant congressman in the 2007 movie " @entity9 , " based on the book by @entity72			1
the book and the film told the story of @entity1 's efforts to get weapons to @entity79 fighters after @entity38 invaded @entity7			1
" @entity68 did a great job , " @entity1 said in 2008			2
@entity1 also praised the other actors			2
" they were too close to the truth , " he said			0
the @entity85 grad and @entity87 veteran was elected to @entity32 in 1972 -- a @entity88 bucking the national @entity90 landslide -- and quickly became known for his high - living escapades , which earned him the nickname " @entity46 , " and shrewd accumulation of political chits			0
his savvy came in handy in the early 1980s , when @entity1 , a staunch anti-communist , decided to help @entity7 rebels in their war against the invading @entity38			2
over several years , working behind the scenes , his efforts to raise funds through his defense subcommittee , to establish a bond with a @entity36 agent named @entity105 ( played by @entity106 in the film ) and to negotiate support from @entity110 countries helped the @entity7 take the upper hand and eventually forced the @entity38 out of the country			0
asked what led to the @entity38 departure , @entity114 leader @entity113 was blunt : " @entity46 did it , " he told @entity118 ' " 60 minutes			0
" some people criticized the film because it did n't do much to highlight what happened in @entity7 after the @entity38 left : the @entity123 's takeover of the country and @entity126 's use of the nation as a base			0
@entity1 was asked in 2008 about the consequences of helping the @entity79 fighters			1
" i do n't think there was a serious blowback , " @entity1 said			2
" i think there was the point that [ author ] @entity72 made in the [ book 's ] epilogue , that the @entity138 saw that they took down one superpower and then the radical ones thought they could take down another one			0
" @entity1 is survived by his wife , @entity142 , a sister , a niece and a nephew			2
