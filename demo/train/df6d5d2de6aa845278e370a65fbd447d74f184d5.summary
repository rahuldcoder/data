vice president @entity22 has served as the country 's acting leader since @entity5 fell ill. @entity5 took office in 2007 in an election mired in controversy and accusations of vote - rigging			1
" there was ballot snatching , voters were molested , voters were beaten ... and also payment inducement to vote for certain candidates , " said @entity30 of the @entity31 , a human rights group in @entity0			0
the president , a soft - spoken and unassuming figure who did not bask in the media spotlight like past leaders of the @entity45 nation , pledged to fight to improve the country of 150 million people despite the accusations			2
" our collective goal is to deliver for our children a @entity1 better , stronger , more peaceful , more secure and more prosperous than we met it , " @entity5 said			2

analysts say he did little to institutionalize reform in a country where two - thirds of the population lives on less than a dollar a day			0
" because many people feel disillusioned economically and as long as they have those sentiments -- i think the risk of radical uprisings in places like northern @entity1 and certainly southern @entity1 in the @entity120 will continue regardless of who is in power , " said @entity115 , an analyst at @entity116			0
