-- while there is still a lot of talk about how the @entity5 needs to reinvent itself , @entity1 should keep in mind they could use a touch - up themselves			1
with 20 @entity9 seats to defend in the midterm election -- compared with just 13 @entity5 ones -- the truth is sen. @entity13 and the gang do not have a lot of time to gloat			1
the economy may be improving , but it is still limping ; millions are looking for work , and the deficit continues to grow			0
so whatever momentum president @entity21 and the @entity1 received from last week 's victories will all be gone come 2016 if they ca n't agree on a detailed budget plan by 2014			1
and let 's be clear : taxing the rich and closing some loopholes is not a detailed plan			2
granted , @entity1 are proposing spending cuts -- but they have to be more bullish about their proposed cuts than they are about taxing the rich			1
the latter got them elected but the economy is in more need of the former			0
allowing the @entity37 tax cuts to expire for those who make $ 1 million a year or more , as championed by some , is estimated to generate only $ 500 billion to $ 600 billion over 10 years			2
that dwarfs the number cutting off @entity42 would bring but it does little to solve the debt problem			0
opinion : conservatives , do n't despair so any plan that does not include significant spending cuts is no plan at all			1
if @entity1 want to build on last week , they have to be bold , because they ca n't depend on republicans to say stupid things about rape or ignore minorities forever			1
in fact , confetti was still falling in @entity55 when @entity37 -- the @entity57 speaking , half - @entity58 nephew of you know who -- filed his papers with the @entity62 to run for an as - yet unspecified office			0
the 36 - year - old is the co-founder of the political action committee , @entity66 @entity5 of @entity67			0
that alone wo n't solve all of the party 's image problems with @entity71 , but as long as he 's not on the crazy , inflammatory side of his party , he 's got the looks , charisma and name to be the kind of political star they need -- the kind who can draw big crowds and maybe sway @entity66 voters two years from now , if not for himself , then certainly for another @entity5 candidate			1
face it @entity1 -- the celebration is over and it 's time to get to work			2
at least six of the @entity9 seats the party has to defend are in red states			1
lose those , and president @entity21 could be spending his final two years butting heads with a @entity92			0
so what do the @entity1 need to do ? opinion : election a call for purple politics well for starters , identify candidates to go after @entity102 @entity101 sen. @entity101 ' seat , because @entity21 won @entity102			1
second , be a party white people want to vote for			0
lost in all of the hoopla about @entity5 needing to adapt to the country 's new demographic , is the fact @entity109 captured the largest percentage of white votes since @entity112			0
true , some of that can be attributed to racist backlash to @entity21 -- but most of it has to do with the message of the @entity1 platform			2
@entity109 characterized 47 % of the country as a bunch of moochers ( and coincidentally came away with 47.8 % of the popular vote )			0
that means a lot of voters : the numbers suggest 88 % of the people who voted for @entity109 were white			0
if @entity1 do n't figure out a way to make their message attractive to white people , they could possibly lose the @entity9			1
and third , and probably most important , they have to be a party worth voting for			0
one can certainly say @entity5 , from the top of the ticket on down , shot themselves in the foot this election , making it easier for @entity1 to paint them as a party to vote against			2
but for the 2014 midterm , @entity1 must present a budget plan people want to vote for			1
in two years voters are going to be asking " what else you got ? " and if @entity1 do n't have an answer , they risk getting shellacked in 2014 , the same way they got their butts handed to them in 2010			1
back then , republicans took back the @entity153			0
politics : 2014 battle for the @entity9 starts now another @entity5 landslide could create a path to the @entity153			2
i hate to be the @entity159 at your @entity161 party , but it is what it is			0
join us on @entity168 / @entity167 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .			2

@entity171 says @entity1 ca n't rest on election *laurels* for 2014 midterm wins
republicans wo n't say inanities about rape or ignore minorities forever , he says
@entity171 : @entity1 need a bold budget plan that *relies* more on spending cuts
loss in 2014 of six @entity1 senators in red states could cost them the @entity9 , he says
