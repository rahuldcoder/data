-- @entity2 's star - studded line - up began their @entity4 campaign with a 1 - 0 victory over @entity6 in their group b opener in @entity8 on saturday			1
a goal from defender @entity10 after six minutes was all that separated the two teams after an inspired display from @entity6 goalkeeper @entity13			1
but @entity14 ended the day on top of the group following a 2 - 0 victory over @entity18 in @entity19 earlier on saturday			1
goals from @entity21 and @entity22 gave the 2002 semifinalists a comfortable win over the 2008 @entity26 cvhampions			0
@entity2 1 - 0 @entity6 @entity13 could do little to stop @entity10 's powerful early header from a @entity29 corner , but he kept his team alive with a string of acrobatic saves to deny @entity34 @entity33			1
@entity35 was delighted to secure his first victory as a @entity4 coach , but critical of his strikers for failing to make the game safe			2
" when you do n't kill things off in front of goal you can pay a heavy price			0
they almost got a draw -- we missed loads of chances , " @entity35 told @entity45			2
" players such as @entity33 and @entity52 knocked in around 60 goals last season between them , yet today it was almost as if they could n't set their sights on goal			2
" but the win means we can be calm -- we are in the right track			0
" @entity13 's tip over from a @entity33 shot led to the early corner from which the unmarked @entity10 scored to spark scenes of wild celebration on the @entity2 bench , led by @entity35			1
@entity33 and @entity52 might both have had hat - tricks as @entity2 's attacking flair was evident , but at the other end @entity6 also had opportunities to salvage a point			1
@entity73 through the second half , @entity71 found space to toe - poke a shot from the edge of the area which went just wide of @entity79 's left - hand post			0
@entity0 's @entity4 twitter.buzz as the clock ticked down , @entity13 blocked @entity33 as he looked certain to score but in a swift counter attack @entity6 then had their best chance of the match as @entity84 crossed from the right and @entity86 made a hash of his volleyed attempt from 10 meters out			1
at the final whistle it was a deserved victory for @entity2 , but they will face a sterner test in their next match in five days ' time against @entity14			1
@entity6 , who have lost five and drawn once since their last @entity4 finals victory in 1998 , will be looking to break that winless run against the @entity98 , who also have a poor record in football 's global showpiece			2
@entity14 2 - 0 @entity18 goals from @entity21 and @entity22 earned @entity14 a comfortable 2 - 0 win against a poor @entity105 side , who never looked like getting on the score sheet			1
central defender @entity21 opened the scoring in the seventh minute , volleying home from close range from a well directed free - kick delivered by @entity112			0
@entity14 should have gone 2 - 0 up after 23 minutes when @entity114 striker @entity113 was sent through on goal by a defense - splitting pass from the boot of @entity22 , but goalkeeper @entity118 saved to send the ball onto the roof of the net			1
the second half carried on where the first finished off , and it was no surprise when @entity22 added a second goal after 52 minutes			0
latching on to a mistake made by @entity128 , the @entity126 midfielder swept forward into the penalty area before coolly slotting past a helpless @entity130			0
the goal did seem to finally wake @entity18 from their slumber , and striker @entity134 forced a fine save from @entity135 in the 80th minute , but it was a rare moment of skill in a woeful display			2
moments later , @entity138 nearly added a third for @entity14 at the other end			0
the result means @entity18 continue their winless @entity4 finals record			0
their only other appearance in 1994 yielded no goals and no points .			0

@entity2 beat @entity6 1 - 0 in their @entity149 opener at @entity150
a sixth - minute goal by @entity10 gives @entity35 's men three points
@entity6 goalkeeper @entity13 denies @entity33 with a string of saves
@entity14 top the group following an earlier 2 - 0 victory over @entity18 in @entity19
