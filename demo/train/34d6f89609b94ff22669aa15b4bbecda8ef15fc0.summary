let 's admit it : we all need to feel special sometimes			0
well , if you 're a firefighter , scientist or teacher , you should			0
after all , a new @entity15 poll indicates that plenty of @entity17 already think you are			1
firefighters have one of the most prestigious jobs , according to a new @entity15 poll			1
@entity17 adults , according to a recent survey by @entity15 , see firefighters , scientists and teachers as the most prestigious occupations while bankers , actors and real estate agents are the least prestigious occupations			1
the 2007 " @entity33 " poll measured the public perceptions of 23 professions			2
participants were asked to rank these professions as having " very great prestige , " " considerable prestige , " " some prestige , " or " hardly any prestige at all			0
" they could also opt not to rank them or say they were n't sure			0
sixty - one percent of adults consider firefighters to have " very great prestige , " making this occupation the most prestigious on the list			1
five other occupations were ranked as having " very great prestige " by over 50 percent of the adults surveyed : scientists and teachers are considered very prestigious by 54 percent of adults , followed by doctors and military officers , who earn the prestige of 52 percent of @entity17 , and nurses , whom half of all adults consider very prestigious			1
among the least prestigious occupations are real estate brokers , actors and bankers			1
only 5 percent of survey participants ranked real estate brokers as very prestigious ; 9 percent gave actors this label , followed by 10 percent for bankers			1
accountants , entertainers , stockbrokers , union leaders , journalists , business executives and athletes all also ranked low on the list : less than 20 percent of adults consider any of the aforementioned occupations to have " very great prestige			1
" consequently , five occupations are perceived to have " hardly any prestige at all " by at least a quarter of adults : stockbrokers ( 25 percent ) , union leaders ( 30 percent ) , entertainers ( 31 percent ) , real estate brokers ( 34 percent ) and actors ( 38 percent )			2
@entity15 started conducting its " @entity84 " survey in 1977 and included only 11 professions			1
the most significant change since the survey 's inception is that , with the exception of teachers and clergy , the perceived prestige of every one of the original 11 occupations has actually decreased over the years			0
the most drastic drop occurred among scientists , lawyers and athletes , whose prestige dropped by 12 points , 14 points and 10 points , respectively			2
clergy members are considered prestigious by a percentage point more of the population than they were 30 years ago , while teachers ' perceived prestige increased by 25 percent			1
understandably , the year - to - year changes are less drastic			0
scientists ' perceived prestige has n't changed in the last year , and despite a significant jump from 1977 , teachers ' perceived prestige has increased by only two percentage points			2
bankers and athletes showed the most drastic drop in prestige : both are down seven points from last year			2
the profession that saw the biggest increase in prestige from 2006 was that of farmers , who rose five points			0
while the survey measures the degree to which certain occupations are considered prestigious , it offers no indication as to why people consider certain occupations more prestigious than others			0
