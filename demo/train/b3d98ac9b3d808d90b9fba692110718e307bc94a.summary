-- big - spending @entity1 have been stripped of their 2003 league title and handed a $ 160,000 fine in the latest crackdown by @entity7 football authorities against match - fixing			1
@entity1 , who achieved worldwide prominence with their audacious signing of @entity13 's @entity12 last year , will also start the next @entity14 ( @entity14 ) with a six - point deduction			1
@entity1 were among 12 clubs handed punishments , while 33 people , including disgraced officials @entity19 and @entity21 , received life bans , according to the official @entity7 news agency @entity23			1
former @entity7 national team players - @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 -- who were jailed for five - and - a - half years last year for taking bribes -- were also banned for life , as was former @entity32 referee @entity31 in 2009 the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) launched an investigation into corruption in 2009 in an attempt to clean up their game			1
" acts of corruption violated national laws , and did serious damage to the image of @entity7 football , " said a statement on the @entity33 's official website			2
@entity19 and @entity21 , who were both high - profile former heads of the @entity33 , were each given jail sentences of 10 - and - a - half years as a result of the investigation , ahead of the further football related punishments announced monday			2
@entity1 , who also signed @entity12 's former @entity13 teammate @entity50 , were found guilty of fixing a game against @entity52 during the 2003 season			1
fellow @entity14 side @entity55 were also found to have fixed a match in the same season and , like @entity1 , were deducted six points and fined one million yuan ( $ 160,000 )			2
in total , 12 clubs were handed " disciplinary punishments " while former @entity7 international @entity61 , who recently became coach of @entity63 , was among a further 25 people banned from the game for five years			0
allegations of corruption linked to gambling have long damaged the reputation of @entity7 football , but the acquisition of @entity72 star @entity12 , fresh from helping @entity13 to win the 2012 @entity73 , was seen as a major coup			0
he was joining @entity50 , who signed in january 2012 , but both have subsequently left the club , with @entity12 joining @entity80 champions @entity78 on an 18 - month deal while @entity50 is on loan at @entity84 giants @entity83			0
the punishments announced by the @entity33 follow the revelations earlier this month of widespread fixing of @entity89 football matches			0
@entity89 law enforcement agency @entity90 announced on february 4 that 380 games in @entity92 -- including @entity32 and @entity94 qualifiers and two @entity73 games -- have been deemed suspicious			0
prior to the @entity90 announcement , @entity97 general secretary @entity96 told @entity0 that match - fixing was a " disease " as he responded to lifetime bans handed out in january to 41 @entity102 players found guilty of attempting to influence the result of games			1
the @entity33 insisted that their anti-corruption drive has achieved " positive results " and in its statement claimed that " public enthusiasm for football is gradually restored , with the audience and television viewers for the @entity14 at record highs			0
" but mired by the controversies , @entity7 's national team has been struggling to make an impression and failed to qualify for the @entity118 after finishing third in a group behind @entity120 and @entity121 .			0
