@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the best of times , the @entity4 square in downtown @entity0 was an awe - inspiring sight for @entity1			1
the broad boulevard was home to the majestic presidential palace , the seat of the country 's power and prestige			2
the century - old gleaming white palace is in ruins			2
and in the shadow of its wrought - iron gates , the immaculately maintained plaza has been overtaken by row upon haphazard row of makeshift shacks as far as the eye dwells			2
these are the new homes of the capital 's displaced residents : rickety quarters comprised of bed sheets , propped up on sticks and held together with ropes			1
nearly 500,000 @entity1 have moved here , rendered homeless by a 7.0 - magnitude earthquake that devastated the impoverished island - nation a week ago			1
throughout the capital , and in other affected areas of the country , similar tent cites have risen -- cramped , squalid encampments filled with the few belongings that residents have salvaged			1
as rescue and recovery efforts continue , these mini-cities pose @entity1 's next challenge			1
" this is the biggest one , " national police chief @entity44 said on monday			1
" we have new area to protect and new people to protect			1
it 's another kind of security we have to ensure			1
this is the toughest one			2
" full coverage @entity54 updates it will be an overwhelming task			2
the @entity0 police force of 4,000 has plunged to about 1,500 -- the rest of the officers dead , wounded or missing , @entity44 said			1
complicating matters , about 4,000 convicted criminals are on the loose			2
the capital 's 95 - year - old , badly overcrowded @entity62 collapsed after the quake , and the inmates escaped			2
" we have an emergency now , " @entity44 said			1
" because , probably next week , we will have more confusion on the street			2
the bad guys will be organizing themselves , and they can be the most principal threat to the police and the population			1
" police presence at these new neighborhoods is sporadic			1
with electricity lines down throughout the city , residents bunch up their meager belongings into pillows and sleep on them after dark			2
@entity81 : looking for loved ones " you put something down , and they steal it , " said one resident , who identified himself as @entity84			0
" you know , there 's no jail in the country			0
all the prisoners go out			0
you do n't know the good people or bad people			1
that 's why you have to be careful			0
" in some camps , residents have far worse fears			0
" by night , with not enough electricity , some people try to rape and steal and kill people also , " @entity44 said			1
@entity104 @entity103 ban ki - moon said monday that he would ask for an additional 2,000 @entity104 troops and 1,500 @entity104 police officers to bolster the 3,000 @entity104 police and soldiers currently deployed in @entity0			1
@entity1 police ill - equipped to handle crisis but security is just one of the many immediate needs that tent - dwellers are praying for			1
they await food and medical help			1
in one tent , an 8 - year - old boy suffers a seizure as family members look on helplessly			1
in another , a little girl cries in pain , her leg wound oozing			0
@entity81 : i 'm alive -- message from @entity1 " the people of @entity1 need help			1
we need help ! " a woman screams , tears streaking her face			0
in another part of the square , an old man sits quietly , thumbing a @entity139			0
" my situation ( is ) very bad , very bad , " he says			0
" @entity141 only know that			0
@entity141 can do everything for me			0
" for many residents , there is little else to do but pray -- and wait			0
the men mill about aimlessly , wondering when help will arrive			0
teenagers rush off when they hear that water and food are available somewhere			2
most of the time , they return empty - handed			0
gallery : devastation in @entity1 with little else to play with , children kick up dirt and squeal in delight			1
their mothers squat by portable stoves , fanning the fire with pieces of cardboard			0
all around , trash piles up			0
the stench is unbearable , worsening by the hour under the hot sun. when night falls , the residents gather by flickering candlelight and sing spirituals to keep their spirits up			0
occasionally , gunshots ring in the distance			0
eventually , they drift off to sleep on tattered mattresses and cardboard boxes			0
tomorrow , they hope , will bring a better day			0
@entity2 's @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 in @entity0 and @entity181 in @entity182 contributed to this report .			0

their homes destroyed , many @entity1 living in *ramshackle* tent cities

in addition to security concerns , people in tent cities want for food and medicine
