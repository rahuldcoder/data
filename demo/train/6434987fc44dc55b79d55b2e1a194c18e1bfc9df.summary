on friday president @entity0 will address the nation about the @entity3 's controversial surveillance programs			1
he is expected to announce some substantive changes to those programs which collect data about the phone calls of every @entity8			2
after the first leaks by former @entity3 contractor @entity10 were published in june , @entity0 defended the @entity3 's surveillance programs during a visit to @entity14 , saying : " we know of at least 50 threats that have been averted because of this information not just in the @entity8 , but , in some cases , threats here in @entity19			1
so lives have been saved			0
" similarly , gen. @entity21 , the director of the @entity3 , testified before @entity22 that " the information gathered from these programs provided the @entity8 government with critical leads to help prevent over 50 potential terrorist events in more than 20 countries around the world			2
" rep. @entity30 , @entity31 , chairman of the @entity32 , said on the @entity32 floor in july that 54 times the @entity3 programs " stopped and thwarted terrorist attacks both here and in @entity36 -- saving real lives			2
" however , a @entity40 review of the government 's claims about the role that @entity3 " bulk " surveillance of phone and e-mail communications records has had in keeping the @entity8 safe from terrorism found that these claims are overblown and even misleading			1
an in - depth analysis of 225 individuals recruited by @entity53 or a like - minded group , or inspired by @entity53 ideology , and charged in the @entity8 with an act of terrorism since 9/11 , demonstrated that traditional investigative methods , such as the use of informants , tips from local communities , and targeted intelligence operations , provided the initial impetus for investigations in the majority of cases , while the contribution of @entity3 's bulk surveillance programs to these cases was minimal			1
( click on the link to go to a database of all these 225 individuals and additional details about them and the government 's investigations of these cases			0
) the controversial bulk collection of @entity8 telephone metadata , which includes the telephone numbers that originate and receive calls , as well as the time of those calls but not their content , under @entity83 of the @entity84 , appears to have played an identifiable role in , at most , 1.8 % of these cases			1
this finding corrobrated that of the @entity0 - appointed @entity32 review group who had access to classified materials that concluded in december that " section 215 telephony meta - data was not essential to preventing attacks			2
" our study also found that @entity3 programs involving the surveillance of non- @entity8 persons outside of the @entity8 under @entity99 of the @entity100 played a role in 4.4 percent of the terrorism cases we examined , and @entity3 surveillance under an unidentified authority played a role in 1.3 percent of cases we examined			1
in 27 percent of the cases we reviewed , court records and public reporting do not identify which specific methods initiated the investigation			0
these cases , involving 62 individuals , may have been initiated by an undercover informant , an undercover officer , a family member tip , other traditional law enforcement methods , @entity117 - or @entity119 - generated intelligence , @entity3 surveillance of some kind , or any number of other methods			1
furthermore , our examination of the role of the database of @entity8 citizens ' telephone metadata in the single plot the government uses to justify the importance of the program -- that of @entity133 , a @entity135 cabdriver who in 2007 and 2008 provided $ 8,500 to @entity137 , @entity53 's affiliate in @entity138 -- calls into question the necessity of the section 215 bulk collection program			2
according to the government , the database of @entity8 phone metadata allows intelligence authorities to quickly circumvent the traditional burden of proof associated with criminal warrants , thus allowing them to " connect the dots " faster and prevent future 9/11 - scale attacks			1
yet in the @entity152 case , after using the @entity3 's phone database to link a number in @entity138 to @entity152 , the @entity119 waited two months to begin an investigation and wiretap his phone			2
this undercuts the government 's theory that the database of @entity8 ' telephone metadata is necessary to expedite the investigative process , since it clearly did n't expedite the process in the single case the government uses to extol its virtues			0
in sum , the surveillance of @entity8 phone metadata has had no discernible impact on preventing acts of terrorism and only the most marginal of impacts on preventing terrorist - related activity , such as fundraising for a terrorist group			1
given that , what should the @entity0 administration do about the @entity3 's phone data collection program , which keeps the phone data of all @entity8 for five years ? president @entity0 has a number of potential choices			1
the first is to continue the program as is			0
another is to give the phone collection program to some kind of private third party entity , and another is to mandate that the phone companies keep the data			1
there are problems with all these approaches			0
the status quo is open to legal challenges			0
judge @entity195 of the @entity196 ruled in december that the program likely violates the @entity198			0
another federal judge , in @entity200 , ruled in favor of the program a week later , so its legal fate might have to be determined by higher courts			0
giving the data collection program to some kind of government - nominated private third party will likely be seen as just another way for the government to store the data			1
and the phone companies do n't want the costs and headaches of storing five years of data			0
there is another approach that should be considered , which is to abandon the bulk phone data collection program entirely and go back to the tried and true approach of having the government get a court order to look at a suspect 's phone records , rather than leaving that decision to the discretion of a group of anonymous officials at @entity3 , as is now the case			1
after all , since 1979 judges have only turned down 0.3 % of the requests they have received for warrants involving cases of suspected espionage or terrorism			0
but such a move would assure @entity8 that there was some sort of due process going on whenever their phone records are examined by the government			0
and this seems closer to the spirit of the @entity245 , which guards against " unreasonable searches , " than does the present system			0
thanks to @entity249 and @entity250 for their research help .			0

@entity253 : @entity40 finds little value to mass surveillance program
he says hardly any terrorism cases were found out or *wrapped* up as result of phone metadata
president @entity0 is giving a speech about @entity3 surveillance friday
@entity253 : ending the mass collection of phone data is a good *solution*
