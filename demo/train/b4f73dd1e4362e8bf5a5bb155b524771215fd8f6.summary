-- with first lady @entity2 turning 50 , we asked some of our 50 - and - older @entity0 colleagues : " if you could go back in time , what advice would you give to your 30 - year - old self ? " here 's what they had to say : @entity10 , " @entity11 " i wish i could express my honest opinion about articles that deal with the " dreaded 50 " -- 90 % of me thinks recognizing women turning 50 is a tad sexist			1
we did not make a big deal when president @entity2 turned 50			1
we recognized it , but we did not ask the president if he would consider using botox or if he would stop playing basketball			1
honestly , i do n't think about my age until i read some article telling me i 'm not dead			1
then , i begin bitching about why i must be " sexy " at 50 -- or a cougar who yearns for a man i would have to financially support			1
attractive women fight to be taken seriously in their 20s , then yearn to " not be taken seriously " in their 50s			1
at least that 's what all those articles tell me			1
with that in mind , what would i tell 30 - year - old @entity10 ? 1			1

here are some things you should have known at age 30 : 1			1
politics and public service is the most exciting , fulfilling career imaginable			2
even the most exciting , fulfilling career is bulls * * * compared to being a father			2
just because someone is on the other side of a political fight , that does not make them a bad person			2
try harder to find your common humanity , even as you beat their brains out politically			2
make sure to answer the phone when the governor of @entity85 calls			2
@entity87 host of " @entity87 : @entity88 " i doubt very much that my 30 - year - old self would have listened -- even to my materialized 57 - year - old self			2
but i guess if i could send a message or three , it would go something like this : 1			2
