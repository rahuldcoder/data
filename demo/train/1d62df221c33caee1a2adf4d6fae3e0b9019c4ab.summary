it 's a tough headline to swallow			1
best burger in the world ? yeah , right			1
cue the commenters getting carried away " my burger joint is better than yours " rants			2
walk them past @entity10 on the main street of @entity13 's adventure capital of @entity14 , however , and the doubters might quickly turn into believers			1
colloquially known as " @entity22 's , " the burger joint is swollen with customers who spill out every opening hour , happy to wait around an hour at peak times for a feed			1
and " peak time " describes most of the store 's 21 - hour day			1
international tourists can be seen emerging with their takeouts , delicately removing a @entity27 ( lamb burger ) or @entity29 ( venison ) , reverently folding the brown paper bag with the treasured logo and carefully tucking it in a backpack			2
next step , burger selfie straight to @entity36			2
" my mates in @entity41 / @entity40 / @entity39 / wherever are gon na be jealous of this			0
big check mark in that @entity45 trip must - do box			0
" like checking out the @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity22 's has become the compulsory stop in @entity14			1
if @entity51 stars were still dished out the way they originally were , @entity54 would bag at least a couple , arguably three			1
( " exceptional food , well worth a special journey			0
" ) among burger lovers anyhow			2
and on any given day ( save @entity58 when @entity22 's closes for a breather ) burger lovers pick from quite a big menu -- around 20 variants , ranging from the standard @entity54 to the @entity63 ( beef , bacon , avocado ) to the @entity67 ( pork belly ) to stuff for impurists like the @entity72 ( falafel ) , @entity73 ( cod ) and holier than @entity76 ( tofu )			1
tasty origins @entity22 's opened in 2001 , a true hole in the wall , hard to find place that quickly rose in popularity -- especially among the ski / boarding , backpacker and adventure crowd			2
it moved to its current location on @entity87 a few years later			0
slightly more room but still pretty cramped with 10 cooks and servers in the kitchen and 50 employees total			0
close proximity burger - flipping and managing hangry ( hungry meets angry ) crowds makes for a tight and well - run bunch of employees			2
" the staff has the philosophy that @entity22 loves you -- we treat others the way they want to be treated , and i think that 's really the key to our success , " says @entity54 general manager @entity97			1
the success comes in spite of the challenges of operating a 24 - hour ( including the three hours of cleaning each day ) restaurant in a small resort town , with a limited and transient staff and difficult food supply lines for fresh produce			1
where 's @entity22 ? the secret behind @entity14 must - visit restaurant does n't sound like much of a secret -- hand - make everything with fresh produce every day			1
the other secret is n't so well - guarded either			1
after shelling out a fair bit of coin for a bungee jump , @entity122 boat ride or day on the slopes , nz $ 10 to $ 15 for a hearty burger is extremely appetizing			2
while @entity97 is happy to discuss management - type stuff , he 's less revealing when faced with tougher questions			0
like , who the hell is @entity22 ? " there are so many stories i do n't even remember what the real legend is -- he may have been the first person to swim naked to @entity137 or -- my favorite -- the first man to go down @entity139 in a barrel , " says @entity97			0
@entity22 's owner prefers to remain hidden from the public , and management refuses to say anything about him / her			0
" we 're about the customer and the product , and providing great service and fresh , honest food , " says @entity97			0
while franchise offers have been coming thick and fast , @entity22 management has n't been swayed			0
" we think we 're in a really special , beautiful part of the world and that 's been a nice part of our formula , " says @entity97			0
" it would have to take an extra special idea to entice us to go somewhere else			0
" the closest thing to another @entity22 's is the opening of @entity162 in 2011 , a bakery next door that does a @entity45 favorite , the meat pie , proud			0
for hungry visitors to @entity14 , this is the fallback when @entity54 crowd 's prove too big a mountain to climb			1
@entity54 , 42 shotover st. , @entity171 ; +64 3 - 441 1232 ; open 8:30 a.m. -5 a.m. , daily except christmas day			1
recommended burgers : @entity27 ( @entity174 lamb , mint jelly , lettuce , tomato , red onion , alioli , tomato relish ) , nz $ 12.50 ( $ 10 ) and @entity29 ( @entity181 deer with a @entity183 plum chutney , lettuce , tomato , red onion , alioli ) .			0

@entity54 's fresh *handmade* burgers are @entity14 's best known secret
so popular *people* often wait an hour for a burger
despite success , @entity54 has n't franchised or *expanded* into a chain
