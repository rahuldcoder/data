@entity0 , @entity1 -- a fight between @entity1 and @entity5 presidential guards sparked chaos during a ceremony attended by the heads of state from 11 @entity10 nations on wednesday			1
@entity5 leader @entity11 and @entity1 president @entity12 attend the opening of the mosque			1
several of the guards to the visiting heads of state from @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 sustained serious injuries in the fight , which included punches , kicks and the drawing of guns			0
no leaders were hurt in the melee , though several were knocked over			0
several journalists also were caught up in the fracas and suffered injuries or lost their grips on cameras and recorders			0
the incident occurred at the opening of a massive @entity39 in @entity0 , a structure begun by the late @entity1 dictator @entity41 in 1972 and completed with financing from @entity5 , according to @entity10 media reports			1
minutes after @entity5 leader @entity11 and his host , @entity1 president @entity12 , jointly unveiled a plaque to mark the event , the @entity5 guards pushed away the guards of other delegations at the mosque 's entrance			1
the @entity1 guards -- who had traded hostilities with the predominantly - @entity55 @entity5 guards at every joint event since @entity11 's arrival in the country sunday -- reacted with fury and fought back			1
@entity12 briefly lost his balance when a hefty @entity5 guard pushed him to a wall			1
another @entity5 guard pushed @entity20 president @entity64 , who also lost his balance but was caught by his own guards			1
the vice president of @entity18 was knocked over by fighting guards as he was taking his shoes off to enter the mosque			2
guards to the rest of the visiting presidents and prime ministers kept their respective leaders out of the fray , with some drawing their guns as the dignitaries looked on in disbelief			2
some leaders -- notably those from @entity22 , @entity19 and @entity24 -- were visibly uneasy as guns were drawn on all sides			0
by the time the fight was over more than six minutes later , about a dozen presidential guards were left bleeding from compound fractures and the @entity5 and @entity1 protocol officials traded bitter accusations of disrespect and racism			1
" what are your people up to ? do you want to kill our leader ? " a @entity5 protocol official said to his @entity1 counterpart			1
the @entity1 official , who declined to be named , shouted back , " why do think you 're superior ? what makes you think @entity1 has any ill intention against @entity11 ? " the @entity1 official said @entity12 's guards were simply doing their job as security for the host country and had a right to respond when the @entity5 guards pushed them back			1
it has taken 36 years to complete the giant mosque on a hill in the heart of @entity0			1
it used to be a colonial fort named after @entity113 capt. @entity112			0
the mosque can accommodate as many as 17,000 people at one time , according to the engineers , who call it the largest mosque in @entity119			0
many @entity120 interviewed said the mosque 's opening evoked sweet memories of @entity41 , the deceased dictator			1
" it is a great day and thanks be to @entity128 for the completion , " said @entity125 , 39			0
" this should remind us that while @entity41 is demonized as @entity119 's worst dictator , there are many things he did for this country that successive governments largely depend on , and much of the completed installations and structures like this beautiful mosque was @entity41 's dream , may @entity128 rest him in peace			2
" the @entity143 vice president of the @entity144 , @entity142 , 57 , said the mosque heals rifts in a religion introduced to @entity1 in 1844 by @entity55 slave traders			1
" i find this complex has brought unity among @entity120 in @entity1			2
there have been so many factions , but this attraction has brought them together , identifying themselves with a common home			0
" the fight prompted a crisis meeting by @entity1 security authorities , after which invited diplomats from mainly the @entity160 missions in @entity1 expressed dismay			2
it shows there is something wrong yet unknown between the two parties , " said the head of one @entity160 mission in @entity0 , who declined to be named			2
the police chief , maj. gen. @entity171 , and the head of the army , gen. @entity172 , declined to comment on the fight			0
but capt. @entity175 , the spokesman of the @entity176 , confirmed their hostile relationship with the @entity5			0
" it is our responsibility to ensure the safety of any visiting head of state			0
we have to do our job using any means			0
but our @entity5 brothers always want us to fail			0
true , it 's not the first time they come and act as you see , " @entity175 said			0
