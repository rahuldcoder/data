@entity0 , @entity1 -- if @entity4 and @entity5 are staying up late worrying about whether they can win the election , they should ponder another , ultimately more important , question : will their campaign rhetoric make it impossible for them to be effective if elected president ? the decisions that each man makes in his effort to defeat the other will shape the political environment in january 2013			1
although we often consider the campaign phase of a presidency to be entirely separate from governing , the truth is that the two are intimately connected			1
whoever takes office in january will face many difficult challenges that will force him to compromise , adjust and move away from campaign promises that no longer fit the reality of the times			1
the @entity33 tax cuts expire at the end of the year , along with the payroll tax cut designed to boost the economy			0
the pressure will be on for the president and @entity39 to make deep spending cuts and revenue increases			1
the president 's health care law will either need to be implemented and funded , or it will have been ruled unconstitutional , thus pushing to the forefront once again the skyrocketing costs of health care			2
in foreign policy , the @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 all point to hot spots that are volatile and unpredictable			0
and these are just the known challenges , let alone the crises we ca n't yet see coming			2
for @entity4 , the dangers are significant			1
to keep @entity59 excited about a second term , it appears that he will continue to focus on the rhetoric of economic populism as well as on attacking the do - nothing @entity39			2
although he has governed like a moderate , his speeches have increasingly stressed the liberal themes of progressive economic policy , criticism of @entity68 and big business and , to some extent , laments about the growing inequality in @entity73 life			0
in his @entity74 , @entity4 castigated @entity68 with populist rhetoric , saying that the problems in the economy had stemmed from the fact that " @entity68 was allowed to play by its own set of rules			1
" he promised that this time around , " it 's time to apply the same rules from top to bottom : no bailouts , no handouts and no copouts			2
" the danger for @entity4 is twofold			1
one the one hand , if the president veers too far to the left on the campaign trail , he will offer more fodder to his opponents who want to paint his every move as being those of a left - of - center @entity97			1
this will be even more problematic than it was in 2009 and 2010 , when @entity4 still enjoyed political capital from his election , which allowed him to rebuff some of these charges and push through his legislative agenda			1
after his re-election , @entity104 would n't have any fears about retribution and they would n't have any reason to compromise			0
as with every second - term president , he would be a lame duck from day one			2
just as important , many moderate @entity59 could be leery about supporting him unless they were sure that doing so would n't hurt their chances for re-election			0
at the same time that a rhetorical shift to the left could alienate possible legislative support , it could also create inflated expectations within the @entity59 base			1
just as many of @entity4 's supporters have been disappointed in his decisions after a campaign that promised transformation , liberals would be doubly dejected if his populism proved to be pure posturing			1
he could leave many @entity59 deeply disappointed over the dim chance of ever delivering on these core ideas			0
finally , in the coming months , @entity4 will continue to succumb to the lure of big money			2
with all his talk about change , this election looks awfully familiar			0
the @entity4 campaign has embarked on an aggressive fundraising project , including relying on super pacs			1
the kind of fundraising and interest group mobilization that will occur might very well define @entity4 by the end of this season as much as any of the bills that @entity39 has passed			2
@entity5 has challenges of his own			1
@entity5 's most obvious campaign struggle will be what to do about the right			1
the tea party @entity104 will continue to pressure @entity5 to play to the base so he can prove he is not the @entity151 candidate his critics present him to be			2
@entity5 will face a strong temptation to echo their positions as he looks to the tea party to mobilize supporters to vote in swing states			1
but if @entity5 pushes too hard in this direction , trying to overcompensate for his perceived centrism , he would make it difficult to appeal to moderate @entity59 in a first term			1
without the support of at least a handful of moderates , persuading @entity39 to pass legislation will be extraordinarily difficult			0
@entity5 will also face growing pressure to promise that he will oppose any kind of revenue increase , including an assurance that he would support an extension of the @entity33 tax cuts for wealthier @entity73			1
given the size of the deficit , such promises would put him in a difficult bind , setting him up for the kind of challenge with the @entity104 base that faced @entity33 in 1990 when he had to settle for revenue increases after promising in his campaigning that he would n't agree to any new taxes			2
the enormity of the deficit will require revenue increases in addition to spending cuts			0
if the next president and @entity39 decide that they must significantly lower the deficit , these painful choices would be on the table			0
. he will need to keep bargaining room to raise taxes so that this does n't haunt him			0
some presidents have faced trouble as a result of the way they campaigned			0
most famously , president @entity197 pulled off a stunning upset against @entity199 in 1948 by running against a " @entity39			0
" although @entity197 's victory is often recounted , what is usually forgotten is that his relationship with @entity39 was terrible over the succeeding few years			0
many of the republicans who had worked closely with the @entity205 in 1947 and 1948 were furious at the campaign theme			0
sen. @entity207 of @entity208 , who had been @entity197 's key ally in the creation of the national security system , complained to one @entity104 operative that , " not even @entity212 [ third party candidate @entity213 ] is saying things better calculated to split the country into snarling vendettas at a moment when our destiny can not afford these soap box luxuries			0
" the result was bitter conflict over domestic issues such as civil rights and the war against communism yet there have been times when campaigning and governance went hand in hand			0
in 1964 , @entity231 of @entity232 used his campaign to define his agenda broadly , contrasting himself with right - wing sen. @entity235 of @entity236 and extolling the virtues of liberalism			0
during the campaign , @entity231 took part in staged events extolling programs that @entity39 had passed			0
the election increased the @entity59 majority in the @entity39 , giving him needed support for passing bills such as @entity247 and federal aid to education , and became a platform to govern			0
@entity4 and @entity5 will have to navigate this difficult path			1
as they focus on each other and the kinds of tactics that will be needed for victory , they must also consider what happens if they do win and how the campaign will help or hinder their chances as president			2
the decisions that give @entity5 or @entity4 the best chance to win in the @entity264 may make success almost impossible to achieve in the @entity266 @entity267 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity270 .			1

@entity270 : rhetoric by @entity4 , @entity5 on campaign trail could be risky
he says the positions they take could weaken their eventual time in the @entity278
next president will face major challenges at home and *overseas* , he says
@entity270 : promises to left or right could make governing very difficult
