it is an age - old question : will humankind ever defeat old age ? plenty of skin care companies would like us to believe so			1
and now , the multinational tech giant @entity5 would like us to think it might be possible too			1
last month @entity5 announced a new medical company called @entity7 , whose explicit aim is to take on aging itself			1
but what will @entity5 's approach be ? and what other research into prolonging life already exists ? with its proliferation of businesses , products and services , it would be easy to forget that not so very long ago @entity5 was just a search engine			1
today , offshoots of the sprawling global corporation can be found researching self - driving cars , developing their own smart phones and tablets and even launching giant balloons into near space			2

@entity7 -- or the @entity34 -- has been set up to research subjects related to aging and its associated diseases			1
announcing @entity7 at a media briefing , @entity5 said that the new and independent company will largely focus on age - attendant conditions such as @entity41 's , cancer and heart disease			1
@entity44 , @entity5 's ever youthful ceo said : " @entity45 and aging affect all our families			1
with some longer term , moonshot thinking around healthcare and biotechnology , i believe we can improve millions of lives			0
" but the question is , what will @entity7 actually do ? at the moment the company is n't giving much detail away : " ( incoming ceo @entity57 ) and i are excited about tackling aging and illness , " @entity44 wrote in his @entity62 blog post			1
but repeated requests from @entity65 to interview either @entity44 or @entity66 were politely declined			0
read more : scientists build human brain inside a computer in the absence of any real information , many commentators have speculated that @entity7 will pursue a ' big - data ' approach to health : gathering massive amounts of information from patients and ' crunching it ' to help speed the way to health care discoveries			1
some have suggested that @entity7 's new ceo will take the view that the best way to tackle aging is to focus on preventing diseases			1
@entity87 , an expert in the field of regenerative medicine , told @entity65 that it is too soon to speculate on what @entity5 's approach will be : " in relation to @entity7 , i think it 's vital to keep in mind that there is essentially no concrete information about their planned direction and emphasis , and any guess that they will take a heavily data - driven approach is no more than a guess			1
" however , he does think that @entity7 will not limit its focus to a single disease : " the statements from @entity44 and @entity66 thus far indicate quite strongly that the emphasis will not be just cancer , or even just a range of specific diseases , but will be ' aging itself ' : page in particular has highlighted the paltry longevity gains that would arise even from totally eliminating cancer			1
" @entity116 , a @entity117 biologist who leads the @entity118 of aging group at the @entity120 , agrees : " from what i 've read , i do n't think the company will mostly focus on cancer			1
in the @entity125 interview @entity44 clearly states that solving cancer is ' not as big an advance as you might think '			2
this is reminiscent of what experts studying aging have been saying for a while , which is that to really make a difference in human health and longevity you need to tackle the aging process rather than individual age - related diseases			1
" read more : secrets spilled in life 's final minutes so where might @entity7 's focus lie ? a broad range of technologies and therapies that promise life extension through different means are currently being researched and tested			1
@entity149 takes a look across the scientific landscape to bring you the view from the front line of the war against aging			2
cryonics cryonics is a process where the body -- or occasionally just the head -- is suspended in liquid nitrogen to ' preserve ' it indefinitely			2
the idea is that in the future the body will be able to be resuscitated and brought back to life			2
once the preserve of celebrities and multimillionaires , cryonics is now gaining traction among the broader public			2
several months ago , @entity170 reported that three senior staff at @entity172 have signed up to have their bodies frozen with two @entity175 - based cyonics organizations : the @entity174 and the @entity176			2
the cost of cryonics can vary wildly			2
the lowest price at the @entity174 is reportedly $ 28,000 for ' cryopreservation ' ; @entity176 charges customers up to $ 200,000 for similar services			0
but does it work ? the @entity174 underline on their website that , as yet , their treatments are based on projections of technology to come rather than present day science : " we firmly believe that with the incredible advances being made in nanotechnology , medicine and science today , cryonics has the same potential to become an everyday reality in the not - so - distant future ... the goal of cryonics is to halt ( the ' dying ' ) process as quickly as possible after legal death , giving future doctors the best possible chance of reviving the patient by repairing or replacing damaged tissues , or even entire organs using advanced computer , nanotech and medical equipment and procedures "			1
cryotherapy the related field of cryotherapy has gained currency in some quarters of athletics , with coaches immersing their athletes in cryotherapy chambers during or after exercise in a bid to aid training and heal injuries			0
the @entity221 soccer team used cryotherapy during the @entity223 in 2012 , and the @entity225 rugby union squad use it as well			0
@entity227 chambers expose players to very low temperatures -- around minus 256 degrees @entity230 ( minus @entity231 ) -- for short periods			0
some theorists believe that doing so can help speed the body 's recovery , but others say that the evidence is incomplete			1
self - healing worms and telomeres in 2012 a group of scientists at @entity242 discovered that a species of flatworm -- the @entity246 worm -- can divide ' potentially forever ' and thus heal itself			0
some researchers hope that the discovery will provide fresh insight into how it may be possible to alleviate aging in human cells			1
dr @entity253 from @entity242 's @entity254 , said : " usually when stem cells divide -- to heal wounds , or during reproduction or for growth -- they start to show signs of aging			2
this means that the stem cells are no longer able to divide and so become less able to replace exhausted specialized cells in the tissues of our bodies			0
our aging skin is perhaps the most visible example of this effect			0
planarian worms and their stem cells are somehow able to avoid the aging process and to keep their cells dividing			0
" according to researchers looking at the worm , the key may be in understanding the function of telomeres -- the ends of a chromosome that protect cells against degradation			0
in 2009 three scientists won the @entity284 for their work on how telomeres protect chromosomes from degradation			0
one theory suggests that if we can work out a way to preserve telomeres , then we would be another step closer to defeating aging			0
cloning and body part replacement another major area of investigation is looking into organ creation and replacement			0
many people die due to organ failure , but imagine if you could just create your own new liver and replace a faulty one ? scientists have already successfully implanted functioning lab - grown kidneys into rats			0
if the therapy could be successfully ( and affordably ) replicated for humans , it could help overcome the significant organ donor shortages that persist in many countries			0
early work into creating organs using 3d printers has also yielded promising results			0
nanotechnology organ replacement will probably only ever be part of the solution however			0
many scientists believe that longevity through repairing the human body requires a broader focus than just replacing individual parts			0
@entity327 , an @entity175 author , inventor and futurist argues in his book @entity330 is near that by the 2020s , nanotechnology may be able to help cure disease			0
@entity327 says that deploying tiny robots ( or ' nanobots ' ) in the body could help overcome the problems of incorrect dna replication -- one of the central causes of aging			0
@entity342 says that nanotechnological research is interesting , but that he believes it is further away from finding a solution to aging than some other treatments : " i pay attention to molecular manufacturing ( the discipline that coined the term " nanotechnology " but then effectively had it stolen by the field of nanomaterials ) , but i think its relevance to medical interventions , whether in aging or otherwise , still seems likely to be further off than the more traditionally biomedical work "			2
so will @entity5 's new company discover a workable solution to aging and death ? only time will tell .			1

@entity5 's new company @entity7 will ' tackle aging and illness '
many believe that @entity7 will take a ' big - data ' approach to speed the way to health care discoveries
exploratory disciplines *including* cryonics , cloning and nanotechnology hope to extend human life
