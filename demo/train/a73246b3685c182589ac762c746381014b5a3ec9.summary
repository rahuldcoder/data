-- " @entity1 shot " " man vs. tanks in @entity4 " " @entity5 in @entity6 " if these phrases immediately conjured a distinct image in your mind , you 're in good company			1
like you , untold millions of people pictured the same thing			2
that 's what iconic means			1
these are the dramatic images that have are embedded in our culture			2
they have come to define a historical event , a famous person -- or maybe even an entire generation			1
they 're the proud images you see on postage stamps , like the flag raisings at @entity29 and , later , @entity30			1
they are also the images that depict terrible tragedies , such as the @entity35 shootings and the @entity37 disaster			1
we see these photos reproduced time and time again			1
so what is it that makes them so iconic ? how did they emerge and stand the test of time ? or more simply , what makes them so special ? learn more than you ever knew about " @entity50 " " i think the most important common denominator is that they strike us on a very deep emotional level , and the emotions are usually some of the deepest emotions that a human being can feel : heroism , fear , grief , joy , " said @entity51 , whose career has included stints as director of photography at @entity55 and picture editor at the @entity57			1
these images appeal to something we all feel , @entity51 said			2
" if you take , for instance , @entity73 's picture of the sailor kissing the nurse in @entity6 on @entity5 : i think you could take that photograph to any country and any culture and you would get a similar sort of response to the joyfulness of it all , " @entity51 said			1
" maybe some countries would not like a public display of a woman being kissed by a man in public , but there is a sort of joyfulness about that picture which i think is universally appealing			2
" another important characteristic of iconic images is that they capture an exact instant and ca n't possibly be repeated , said @entity99 , a former @entity55 picture editor who has been taking photos professionally for more than 50 years			1
he said the two most iconic pictures from this century are the hooded prisoner at @entity103 and the falling man from the @entity105			1
" those simply upset us to see			2
we see it immediately , we grasp its significance , it 's an exact moment , " @entity99 said			2
" the photographs could not possibly be repeated			1
" and i think that 's true of the @entity29 photograph that @entity116 took in @entity117 it 's true of photographs like @entity35 , the guy who was shot and the girl kneeling over him , and ... in @entity122 , the burned girl running down the road and @entity126 ' police chief executing a @entity128 prisoner			1
they 're all pictures that are an exact instant			2
" years after they were taken , iconic photographs can help us bring historical events into focus			1
they can help us to better understand the time period and what the prevailing sentiment was at the time			2
" i think in @entity122 , it was opposition to the war , " @entity99 said			0
" there were many great photographers in @entity122 taking extremely wonderful photographs of combat			1
but none of them are iconic , i do n't think			1
... it was these situations that you simply looked at in the morning and you said : ' that 's not what this country is about			0
this should n't be happening			0
we should n't be involved in this			0
' " images can also define how we ultimately view historical figures			1
@entity160 's sultry legacy is often traced back to the shot of her dress blowing up in " @entity163			0
" and @entity165 's portrait of a scowling @entity166 -- reportedly caused by @entity165 snatching @entity168 's cigar -- cemented @entity166 's reputation as a " roaring lion			0
" " it summed up the leadership qualities that he had in an amazing way and made @entity168 even more famous , " @entity99 said			0
for decades , one would usually find these iconic images in a newspaper or magazine			1
but the digital age -- the rise of the @entity181 and cellphone cameras -- has changed things forever			0
" i think there are probably more pictures being taken now than there have ever been taken in time , " @entity51 said			0
" you just walk around and you see people always taking pictures on their @entity190			0
there 's a massive visual imagery that is being generated by the public			0
" that could be a good or a bad thing , depending how you look at it , @entity51 said			0
on the positive side , there is more opportunity now than ever for someone to capture an exact moment			0
and where there once was a significant time lag between when a photo was taken and when it was seen at the breakfast table , now it 's instantaneous			0
but a potentially iconic photo , @entity51 said , could be drowned out today by the sheer volume of photos available			1
" i think it 's much more difficult now for any particular image to rise to the surface , " @entity51 said , " because we are so inundated with visual imagery nowadays			1
... you are getting the image so quickly , and it 's being followed up by so many more images afterward			1
" before the @entity181 , media outlets had limited space and had to be more selective with photographs			1
the scarcity of photos usually gave people more time to absorb the images and put them into proper perspective			2
but with much more space online , the standards have lowered , said @entity229 , curator at the @entity230			0
now , it 's not uncommon to see blurry cell phone pictures and poor amateur photographs published			2
and most cell phone photos still have a long way to go if they 're to going to be considered anything near iconic			1
" right now , it 's pretty hit or miss , " @entity229 said			0
" it 's pretty haphazard and it 's very much focused on the personal			0
' @entity244 , ' i 'm sure , far outweigh any other pictures that anybody takes			0
" but it 's a process			0
we 're all undergoing learning experiments with the digital , even though it 's been around for so long			0
" @entity229 cited the recent @entity253 bombings as an example when most amateurs and their cell phones fell short of delivering high - quality images			0
many photos were taken on the run and came out blurry or crooked			2
" it 's very easy to take a picture ; it is not very easy to take a good picture , " @entity229 said			0
" and it is even harder to take a picture that lasts through time			0

*unforgettable* photos often define an event , a person , or even a generation
