-- gov. @entity2 of @entity3 will not pardon legendary @entity5 outlaw @entity4 in the death of a law enforcement officer more than a century ago , he said friday			1
@entity2 made the announcement on @entity10 's " @entity9 " the same day he leaves office			1
the issue facing @entity2 was whether one of his predecessors , gov. @entity13 , promised about 130 years ago to pardon @entity4 -- known more formally as @entity4 -- for killing sheriff @entity15 of @entity16 , @entity3			1
@entity13 has long been said to have promised a pardon if @entity4 testified before a grand jury that was investigating another killing			1
@entity13 did not follow through on that promise , many say , and the reasons are debated			0
@entity2 said he believes that @entity13 did promise to pardon @entity4			1
yet there is " historical ambiguity " about why @entity13 did not follow through , @entity2 said , and he did not want to second - guess the former governor 's decision			1
" it was a very close call , " @entity2 said			2
" the romanticism appealed to me to issue a pardon , but the facts and the evidence did not support it			1
" the governor acknowledged a positive side effect of his consideration of a pardon			2
" it 's good for tourism , " he said			0
" it 's gotten great publicity for the state			0
" @entity4 was born @entity4 but was also known as @entity4 and @entity4			2
he died at the hands of sheriff @entity43 129 years ago			0
he was 21 at the time of his death			0
@entity13 's great - grandson , @entity46 of @entity47 , @entity48 , has said there is no proof of an offered pardon			2
" where is the hard , concrete evidence ? " he asked @entity0 friday , adding discussion of exactly what happened is full of " gray areas			0
" while crediting @entity2 for " the correct rational track " in his decision , @entity13 said " why the governor commenced this nonsense four months ago remains a mystery			1
" a pardon would have defamed his ancestor , @entity13 said			0
" ( @entity13 ) was a heroic figure in the history of the @entity66 in the 19th century			1
" some members of the @entity43 family opposed a pardon			0
besides arguing that @entity4 was an incorrigible killer , they wanted to make sure the sheriff was absolved of any wrongdoing related to the killing			2
@entity73 , the grandson of the sheriff , cheered the governor 's decision friday			2
" yay ! no pardon ! looks like it will be a great @entity80 ! " he said			0
@entity2 had said he would not do anything that cast a cloud on @entity43			2
some residents , including governor - elect @entity84 , said there are more pressing issues facing the state			2
@entity2 , a @entity4 buff , examined a promise by @entity13 , the territorial governor , about 130 years ago to issue the outlaw a pardon			1
" a promise is a promise and should be enforced , " said @entity93 defense attorney @entity92 , who filed the petition for the pardon and volunteered to handle the case for free			0
following @entity2 's decision , @entity97 said in an e-mail , " we won the battle ( acknowledgement of @entity13 's broken promise ) , but lost the war ( the pardon )			1
the historic debate will continue and perhaps a future @entity3 governor will grant justice for the @entity109			0
" @entity43 killed @entity4 on july 14 , 1881 , in @entity110 , weeks after the outlaw escaped from a jail			1
the sheriff , legend has it , was hiding in the dark and shot the kid when he entered a room			0
@entity43 was gunned down in 1908 at age 57			0
@entity2 had stressed that he would decide only the matter of @entity13 's promise of a pardon			1
@entity13 -- who had also been a @entity123 general in the @entity124 and wrote the novel " @entity125 " -- had promised to grant @entity4 amnesty for the fatal shooting of @entity15 and other " misdeeds " if he agreed to testify before a grand jury investigating another murder			0
@entity4 cooperated , but the pardon did n't happen			1
according to @entity131 and other historians , @entity4 at one point wrote to @entity13 , asking him to honor the deal			0
@entity43 's family argues @entity4 decided to flee house arrest , making the pardon moot			1
he eventually was convicted in @entity15 's death and was sentenced to death , the petition states			0
but he escaped from jail on april 28 , 1881 , killing two deputies			0
" still , regardless of @entity4 's crimes , the motives of @entity2 or the hollowness of posthumous justice , it all comes back to @entity13 's promise			1
a deal is a deal , and 129 years does n't change that			0
@entity4 is owed a pardon , " @entity131 wrote earlier this year in the @entity150 .			1
