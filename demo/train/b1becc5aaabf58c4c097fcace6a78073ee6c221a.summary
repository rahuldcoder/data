-- " try to imagine the situation , " says @entity0 , captain of @entity3 's 1956 @entity2 water polo team			1
" a superpower destroys your country with weapons and tanks -- a country that has never asked for that power to be there			0
and after that revolution is crushed you have to face the representatives of that superpower			0
" the @entity17 became the backdrop to one of the most famous contests in @entity2 history , where blood spilled in the sporting arena came to symbolize the bloody struggle of a nation against a brutal oppressor , the @entity27			1
the events at the @entity29 in december that year became known as the " @entity31 " match , but when @entity3 's water polo team set off for @entity35 in early november , the possibility of freedom still hung over the streets of @entity37			1
@entity39 protests and fighting which erupted on october 23 had died down after a ceasefire was ordered , and @entity43 armed forces were beginning their withdrawal			2
@entity45 had taken part in the initial rally , leaving the team 's training camp in the hills above @entity37 to join protestors on the streets			2
but by the time they set foot on @entity35 soil , @entity45 and his teammates were informed of a brutal turn of events as @entity43 forces ruthlessly reasserted their grip on the @entity3 capital			1
more than 2,000 protesters were killed in the fighting , hundreds more were injured and many thousands were forced to flee the country			1
it proved to be a bloody prelude to a bruising semifinal showdown with the @entity43 water polo team			1
@entity0 recalls a tough , but generally disciplined match which turned sour in the closing moments when @entity43 player @entity74 elbowed @entity3 's star @entity75 in the face , cutting him below the eye			1
" i told ( @entity78 ) to get out of the pool , " @entity0 recalled , " but not where he was , but to swim across the pool to the grandstand with 8,000 people			0
" by the time he 'd swum over , the blood had trickled down onto his chest			0
he looked like he ( had come out ) from the butcher			0
" the headline " @entity98 violence erupts at @entity99 " ran the following day in the @entity91 , which reported that many spectators left their seats in the stands , shouting abuse and spitting at the @entity96			2
the image of @entity75 standing poolside , blood streaming down his torso , quickly gained a wider audience			0
it seized the imagination of a world shocked by the crushing of the @entity3 uprising , while offering some crumbs of comfort to a traumatized nation as the @entity3 triumphed 4 - 0			1
the team went on to win in the final , beating @entity114 2 - 1 to claim the nation 's fourth @entity2 gold in the competition			1
@entity75 , who did n't play in the final , never returned to @entity3 , instead choosing to settle in the @entity119 and become a swimming coach in @entity121			2
the victory over the @entity43 inspired the making of a documentary " @entity125 " and a feature film " @entity128 , szerelem " ( " @entity129 " ) both released to mark the 50th anniversary in 2006			2
the documentary , co-produced by @entity132 director @entity131 , was narrated by seven - time @entity2 champion @entity133 , who was coached by @entity75 as a youngster during the 1960s			0
the dramatic events in @entity137 form the centerpiece of a rich and proud heritage in the sport which has seen the @entity3 rack up nine @entity2 golds , more than twice as many as any other nation			0
the " @entity31 " story continues to inspire and motivate @entity3 's modern water polo heroes including @entity144 , who grew up in dying years of communist rule			1
" beating the beast , the big enemy was such a great feeling for every @entity3			0
it helped so much for the revolution , " @entity144 said			0
the 34 - year - old was part of the @entity3 team which beat @entity96 opposition in the final at the @entity157 in 2000 , ending a 24 - year gold medal drought			1
further success followed at @entity160 in 2004 and in @entity161 four years later			0
@entity162 will be aiming for a record fourth straight gold at this year 's @entity164 .			0

@entity3 's water polo match with @entity27 played against backdrop of revolution
@entity3 beat @entity43 4 - 0 in semifinal at @entity99 in 1956 and went on to take gold
failed revolution claimed 2,000 lives and created hundreds of thousands of *refugees*
