-- in " @entity6 , " two couples who are polar opposites — one sweet , restrained , and devoted ; the other raunchy , angry , and uncommitted — form together out of two sets of best friends in @entity3			1
@entity7 ( @entity8 ) and @entity9 ( @entity10 ) are the nice ones			1
back in the day when this movie ( or at least a version of it ) starred @entity15 and @entity16 , they would have been called '' yuppies , '' and by that i mean less their status than their style : the intimate meals consumed with wine under mood lighting at the kitchen island , the way the two hold their feelings in			2
@entity30 dives into ' @entity31 ' with @entity32 of course , yuppie style in the movies is often code for @entity35 to have a @entity36 , but it 's clear early on that @entity7 and @entity9 really are meant for each other			0
their lovey - dovey moments are genuine and , on occasion , touching — like when he takes her to a @entity45 game with lousy bleachers season tickets that have been in his family for decades , and she loves him for holding on to them			2
the plot of most romantic comedies consists of the things that get in the way of two people getting together			0
that 's what happens in " @entity6 , " too , except that the only thing getting in the way of @entity7 and @entity9 getting together is their own relationship			2
they hold everything up to a microscope and become convinced that their foibles are fatal			0
they also fall apart with a little help from their friends			0
as soon as @entity76 ( @entity75 ) and @entity77 ( @entity74 ) meet , they know how to do exactly three things : drink , fight , and go to bed in lusty , nasty ways			1
but it 's not just that they like ragging on each other and then making up by doing things like having sex with one of them wearing a chicken mask			0
@entity76 , a devoted bachelor , is n't so much scared of commitment as he is blithely , belligerently contemptuous of it , and @entity77 , a dental hygienist , treats love as if it were plaque — as something to be removed			0
the two spread their toxic belief that love is a second - rate emotion into the hearts of their two ( wiser ) pals , who start , almost in spite of themselves , to listen to them			2
casting net : @entity103 may team up with @entity104 when " @entity6 " is funny , which is every so often , it 's because of @entity75			1
he now owns the fastest mouth in movie comedy , and he knows how to employ his whole high - pitched @entity110 street - fury style so that it expresses something more humane than it did when @entity110 was ruling the screen with it			2
in " @entity6 , " @entity75 blows up , to hilariously oversize proportions , the eternal male desire for freedom			1
he 's raunch on wheels			0
on paper , " @entity6 " is a third - generation copy of @entity120 's 1974 stage play " sexual perversity " in @entity122 — but if anything , the way the material has now been rewritten again , it comes closer to @entity120 's rancorous vision of dueling hormones than the ' 80s screen version did			1
that said , the play itself was just a trifle ( though it once seemed novel , much more than it does 40 years later , for the vital vulgarity of @entity120 's voice )			1
the 1986 " @entity6 " was watchable but mediocre , and the new version is watchable ... and a bit less mediocre			1
you always know , in essence , where it 's going , and i wish that @entity8 and @entity144 seemed less like a truly nice couple and more like movie stars			1
by the end , however , the movie has captured something undeniably genuine about contemporary relationships : all the ways that they can , and will , get in their own way			0
