tv ads , the " i 'm a @entity3 " vs. " i 'm a pc " battle has never been a particularly close one , at least in terms of sheer numbers			1
to put it bluntly , @entity9 gets creamed			2
but a leading tech analyst has put together a graphic showing that the ratio of @entity14 - based computers to @entity3 has tightened dramatically and is closer than it has been in a decade and a half			1
analyst @entity17 of @entity18 has been following the @entity3 - @entity5 war for years and recently crunched the numbers to show that , in 2011 , @entity22 's pc desktops and laptops outsold @entity9 's @entity3 by a less - than 20 - to - 1 ratio			1
which , sure , is still lopsided			0
but it 's the lowest margin since 1996 and is roughly the same as 1985 , shortly after the @entity3 was first released			1
and it 's significantly tighter than in 2004 , the pc 's high - water mark , when it was outselling @entity3 by a ratio approaching 60 - to - 1			1
factor in mobile gadgets like smartphones and tablets , where @entity9 has so far outshined @entity22 ( though the @entity14 - makers hope to change that with the new surface tablet ) and you 've got a playing field that , if not level , is certainly less tilted than it used to be			1
the shift , @entity17 wrote wednesday , began in earnest in 2004			2
" although pc volumes continued to grow , they did so more slowly and the @entity3 grew faster , " he said in a blog post			2
" what coincided with this was the emergence of portable computing			0
the @entity50 became easily differentiable as a " better " laptop			0
it was not faster , did not have more storage or any key metrics being used to sell @entity5 it was just better as an integrated product			0
" that 's been the biggest shift since the mid- 90s , @entity17 writes , when the success of @entity59 gave a similar boost to @entity22			2
the pc advantage steadily climbed from 1995 to 2004 , dipping only once in a 10 - year span			1
when iphones , @entity65 and other mobile devices are factored in , @entity22 's advantage sits at about 2 - to - 1 , @entity17 said , and the two could break even within the next two years			1
it 's unclear how much he factored in @entity69 , @entity22 's new operating system that will run on both pcs and portable devices with the goal of marrying them together into a seamless computing experience			2
but @entity17 says that @entity22 's evaporating lead could be bad news for the software company			0
" the consequences are dire for @entity22 , " he wrote			0
" the wiping out of any platform advantage around @entity14 will render it vulnerable to direct competition			0
this is not something it had to worry about before			0
" @entity14 will have to compete not only for users , but for developer talent , investment by enterprises and the implicit goodwill it has had for more than a decade			0

analyst shows @entity3 vs. pc gap *narrowing*
pcs outsold @entity3 by a ratio of about 20 - to - 1 last year
that 's still big , but way down from nearly 60 - to - 1 in 2004
factor in mobile devices and @entity9 pulls even closer
