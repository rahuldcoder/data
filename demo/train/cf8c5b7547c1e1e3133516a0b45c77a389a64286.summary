-- @entity2 authorities said monday that they 've spotted a troubling immigration trend : large numbers of migrants abandoned at sea by traffickers			1
every month , @entity2 's navy says it rescues about 150 stranded migrants , left adrift in overloaded boats off the country 's @entity11			1
as part of the scam , officials said in a statement , traffickers tell the migrants that there has been an equipment failure and promise to return but never do			1
the immigration and maritime authorities said the frequency of that approach -- about 10 or 12 times per month -- inspired them to issue a warning on monday : " do not allow yourself to be fooled and put your life at risk by leaving it in the hands of people without scruples whose only goal is obtaining money without caring about the lives of other human beings			2
" authorities have long warned of the dangers of illegal border crossings , often focusing on perilous desert treks by land			0
and in the past five years , maritime border crossings into the @entity45 have become a " new frontier , " said @entity47 , a professor of political science at @entity49 and an expert on @entity2 and border security			1
" it 's a reflection of the fact that is has become significantly more difficult to cross the border by land , " he said			0
that means the @entity57 and the @entity58 will likely need more resources , he said , " to address not only the illegal activity , but also the different kinds of risks that implies for people who are putting themselves in that situation			0
" " we 're likely to see a dramatic increase now in drownings and other kinds of water fatalities and other kinds of danger associated with crossing in the water , " he said			0
the statement from @entity2 authorities on monday suggests that attempted border crossings by boat are drawing increasing concern			2
but it is n't a new phenomenon			0
in 2009 , @entity45 officials said @entity2 smuggling drugs and migrants into the @entity45 were increasingly turning to the @entity83 for a short sail to the @entity86 coast			1
" we 've seen a huge spike in smuggling by water , " @entity87 , a spokeswoman for the @entity89 office in @entity90 , said in 2009			0
despite the dangers of border crossings , new figures released by the @entity95 on monday indicate that more than a third of @entity2 surveyed say they would move to the @entity45 if they could			1
in a national opinion survey of 1,000 @entity2 conducted last month , more than 60 % said they would not move to the @entity45 even if they had the means and opportunity to do so , but a " a sizable minority " of 35 % said they would move to the @entity45 if they could			1
and 20 % said they would emigrate without authorization , according to @entity95			0
immigration is expected to be one of the topics on the table when @entity45 president @entity114 travels to @entity2 this week			2
@entity115 and @entity0 's @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 contributed to this report .			0
