-- two late bogeys left @entity2 a frustrated figure in @entity4 but the four - time major winner was hoping a spot of gridiron would help lift his spirits			1
the @entity9 is still tied for the @entity10 lead on three - under despite that slump , but his thoughts immediately turned to the @entity15 ' @entity14 clash with the @entity16			1
@entity2 , who described himself as a " big time " football fan , said : " even though you guys play with pads on , which ... i do n't understand			1
" the 25 - year - old met @entity24 quarterback @entity23 at @entity25 on tuesday , who handed over tickets for its opener against the @entity30 on sunday			0
and @entity2 is well placed to head to @entity32 as the leader of the @entity35 playoffs after he joined @entity37 @entity36 and @entity38 at the top of the leaderboard			1
the 2014 @entity42 and @entity37 @entity43 champion had been out in front on five - under but dropped two shots in his final three holes to sink back into the pack			2
" i 'm a little frustrated coming off the course , because i feel like it should have been better than what i finished , " @entity2 told @entity48			2
" but you can see by the scores , it 's pretty tricky out there ... so a 67 is a really good start , even though it could have been a bit better			0
" the fairways are firm so even when you 're hitting irons and fairway woods off the tees they 're running out and through fairways and into the rough and the rough is thick			0
" then the greens are so firm , the greens have got so much firmer over the past 24 hours and it 's really made a huge difference			0
" the course 's elevation has suited big hitters like @entity2 , who was launching drives nearly 400 yards in his practice rounds prior to the tournament			2
but the different air conditions make it more tricky to judge distance and ball flight , with several players overshooting greens on the opening day .			0
