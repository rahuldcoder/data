-- the world is waiting on the next pope in more ways than one			1
everyone , including the @entity6 , is wondering who the next @entity7 and leader of the world 's billion @entity9 will be			1
but the world is waiting in another , more urgent sense , because the pope is n't just a spiritual leader to @entity9			1
his work has a global dimension			2
as has been true in the past , the next pope will have to provide a moral voice to a range of challenges			1
an estimated 1.7 billion people live without adequate health care or decent living conditions and more than 1.3 billion live below the measure of extreme poverty			1
some 870 million people are chronically malnourished			2
@entity28 identified himself with the poor and the marginalized and all @entity30 have a responsibility to them			0
but the pope , as @entity33 and @entity34 on @entity35 , bears a special burden			2
currently 75 % of the world 's population faces growing threats to religious freedom , according to a 2012 report from the @entity43 's @entity42			1
the @entity44 of @entity45 says in a recent report that while many religious groups face persecution , @entity30 are harassed in 111 out of 193 countries			2
an estimated 150,000 christians die each year because of their faith			0
many others have had to leave their countries because of war , oppression or rapid political change			0
in @entity59 , the @entity58 population has dropped from 80 % to 28 %			0
opinion : what @entity61 want from next pope the safety of the entire world is a concern with the rise of fundamentalist @entity68 groups in the wake of the @entity70 and the possible nuclear ambitions of @entity72 and @entity73			1
the next pope will also face a changing church , which , while ever ancient , is ever new			0
two thirds of the world 's catholics live in @entity78 , @entity61 and @entity79			0
the church is growing the fastest in @entity61 and @entity78			0
in the @entity80 , 54 % of @entity9 born since 1982 are @entity81			0
also , an unprecedented 16 % of the @entity80 population claims no religious affiliation , a challenge to the faith that calls for urgent renewal			0
this month in @entity91 , in view of all these many challenges and heartbreaks , the cardinals have the solemn responsibility to give the world a good shepherd who can guide them to the source of true hope and freedom , which is found in @entity28			1
this is why viewing the upcoming conclave as a popularity contest is to have everything backward			0
as with picking a pastor or a diocesan bishop , the starting point must be the needs of the people			1
in the case of the pope , that happens to be the entire world			1
