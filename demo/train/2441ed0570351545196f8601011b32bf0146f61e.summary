-- @entity1 's 14 years as president of @entity3 were so personality - driven that the movement behind him became known as " @entity5			1
" @entity5 encompasses not just the political machine that saw @entity1 re-elected four times , but a leftist ideology that prioritized the redistribution of oil wealth to the marginalized and valued sovereignty as something to be protected from " imperialist " powers			1
now , with its leader gone , the future of @entity5 could take many paths , experts say			1
other powerful leaders in history who left a similar hole have seen their ideologies live on , though not without change			0
there is a trade - off between the degree to which a government centers on one person and the strength of that country 's institutions , said @entity31 , a professor of political science at @entity33 who studies @entity3			1
in general , the stronger the central figure , the weaker the institutions			0
" in authoritarian regimes , you always have a crisis moment when you see a change in leadership , " @entity31 said			0
@entity1 was democratically elected , but his efforts to consolidate power in the presidency led to accusations of authoritarianism			1
change is inevitable after the loss of a revered leader , but the degree of transformation varies			2
in @entity53 in the period after @entity55 until 1980 , @entity52 succeeded in keeping the various ethnic groups in his country united			0
despite being considered an authoritarian , he remained popular because of the unity and economic success			0
upon his death , however , the country unraveled and fell into civil war , and @entity53 crumbled , eventually splitting into separate nations			0
after @entity66 died in the @entity67 , there was a complete break with his regime under the new leader , @entity70			0
@entity70 rejected @entity66 's terror tactics			0
change in @entity73 was more subtle after the passing of the torch from @entity76 to his brother @entity77 , @entity31 said			0
the @entity78 share their communist views , but after the younger @entity77 took office , he purged some men and has since pursued policies to somewhat open up @entity73			0
@entity3 interim president @entity83 is expected to vie for the full - time job , and analysts predict he has the best shot at getting elected			1
if elected , @entity83 eventually will have to purge some of the @entity1 loyalists and shake up the @entity88 to consolidate his own power , @entity31 said			1
" whoever comes next is going to have to assert himself in a pretty domineering way , " he said			0
@entity94 - @entity3 relations likely to remain tense after @entity1 the lasting power of @entity1 's image @entity1 's dedication to putting the nation 's poor at the forefront of his policies made him a hero among a large sector of the population			1
his freewheeling spending of his nation 's oil wealth was criticized by some economists as unsustainable , but @entity3 's poor saw results and elevated @entity1 to hero status			1
in @entity112 , such status carries a lot of weight			0
hero or villain ? the many ways to see @entity1 consider a movement in @entity119 that has survived over the years : @entity120			1
@entity121 was the leader of a rebellion in the late 1920s and early 1930s against an @entity94 occupation			0
the @entity124 are in power today in @entity119 , under president @entity126 , though the movement has little to do with its origins , said @entity129 , a professor of political science at the @entity131			1
@entity121 's memory has been manipulated for political purposes over time , just like @entity1 's might			1
years after @entity121 was killed , @entity119 used his image as a symbol in their own rebellion to overthrow a dictatorship			0
a movement , the @entity124 , was born			0
the current @entity124 president uses the same symbol and movement , though it has been manipulated from earlier @entity120 , @entity129 said			0
" when people find a symbol or answer to their aspirations , they tend to perpetuate it , " @entity129 said			0
in the case of @entity5 , it is difficult to predict what will happen the movement as a political movement , @entity129 said			1
" but what i can say is that the memory of @entity1 will last			2
it will be very difficult to erase it from the poor sector of @entity3 who found answers in the image and words of @entity1 , " he said			2
millions of @entity3 found hope in @entity1 , and now the question is who will appropriate his image and how will they use it , @entity129 said			2
conceivably , even the opposition could take aspects of @entity1 's legacy and make it their own , he said			1
already during last year 's electoral campaign , the opposition vowed not to undo the social missions that @entity1 initiated , but only to modify them			1
the director of the polling firm @entity175 , @entity176 , predicted something similar in a series of @entity180 posts before @entity1 died			2
" to count out @entity5 without @entity1 is to ignore that there is @entity182 without @entity183 and @entity120 without @entity121 , " he tweeted			1
" it will suffer a great loss without @entity1 , but it has a legacy of power and symbolism that it can exploit			1
" @entity182 is a movement named after former @entity190 president @entity183 , a legacy that has been claimed over the years by parties both on the political right and left			2
outlook good for @entity5 in short term despite suffering from cancer , @entity1 resoundingly won re-election in october			1
his popularity , combined with the outpouring of tributes in the wake of his death , make a @entity5 victory likely in the new elections that must be called			2
@entity83 was named by @entity1 as his preferred successor and could easily win the election , but he will have to put the movement 's unity as his priority , said @entity209 , a professor at @entity3 's @entity210 who has written several books about @entity1 's @entity3			1
there are divisions within @entity5 that have come to light as @entity1 's health faded			1
some stand behind @entity83 , who is close with the @entity73 regime , while others side with @entity219 , the @entity220 president who is more of a nationalist			0
because @entity1 was never sworn in for his latest terms , there is even a debate over which of the two , constitutionally , should be the interim president			2
in the short term , @entity83 will have to avoid internal dissent that threatens the movement , @entity209 said			0
that may mean adopting populist positions that the nationalists like			0
" i do n't see a turn to the moderate policies that some favor , " @entity209 said			0
one of the characteristics of @entity5 is the fervor of its adherents			2
@entity1 was a master of cultivating that fervor , and the next @entity5 leader will have to do the same , @entity209 said			1
" in any process of far - reaching changing , it is essential , " he said			0
maintaining that level of fervor keeps followers from becoming disillusioned , he said			0
one of @entity1 's strategies was to surprise @entity3 with new policies that invigorated the rank - and - file , a formula that future leaders may have to follow , he said			1
in a speech at his swearing in as interim leader , @entity83 promised to follow @entity1 's path			1
" we still have him in our hearts , " he said			0
" i have him here , here , as if he was the name in my soul , because i am his son			0
" the future of @entity5 the grip of @entity5 on @entity3 is not guaranteed			2
" i have my doubts about the existence of @entity5 without @entity1 , " leading opposition figure @entity264 told a @entity266 newspaper in january			1
" to me , any movement without its leading figure is deeply vulnerable			0
" @entity264 is expected to be the opposition candidate to challenge @entity83 for the presidency			0
" it will depend on opposition voters understanding that @entity5 without @entity1 is beatable and deeply vulnerable if they mobilize , " he said			1
if @entity5 is victorious in its first election without @entity1 , the new leader will have to face decisions that may cause dissatisfaction among the movement , said @entity31 , the @entity33 professor			1
if @entity83 wins , he will have to deal with a tough economic crisis and will be forced to consider future devaluations and spending cuts , topics which have provoked tensions within @entity5 in the past			2
the next president also will have to rethink the way that the country 's oil wealth is spent and the subsidies it provides , both foundations of @entity5			1
supporters of @entity1 are more optimistic about the lasting legacy of @entity1			2
" @entity5 , at one point , was focused on the figure of @entity1 as the all - emcompassing one , but it grew and expanded to become this mass movement that has crossed the borders out of @entity3 into the world beyond and has affected countries around the world , " @entity296 , a @entity3 - @entity94 attorney , author and adviser to @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity299			1
chavismo and the social revolution that @entity1 began will continue , she predicted			2
" @entity1 ( was ) a very powerful personality , very charismatic person , larger than life , and most media attention went to him , " @entity296 said			2
" but in the end , what really has been going on in @entity3 is a whole transformation of the country , that 's why it 's called a revolution , changing every sector of society			0

@entity5 is the political movement that backed @entity1
challenges arise for such movements when its titular leader is removed
analysts predict @entity1 's party will remain in power , but challenges will arise
