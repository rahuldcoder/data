but in recent days , there was a sudden change of position			0
in a prepared statement saturday , the princess 's lawyers said that an appeal of the preliminary charges would have " collateral effects " for the princess by dragging out the process and that she had decided to " appear voluntarily " before the judge , who initially set march 8 as the court date			1
on monday , the judge told reporters that given the new situation , he felt obliged to move up the court date , to february 8			0
that 's a saturday , and , as with her husband last year , authorities think a weekend day is a better time for the court appearance in central @entity34 , given the intense media attention , a court spokeswoman said			0
the case centers on @entity77 's nonprofit foundation , which obtained public contracts from regional governments to stage sports and tourism events			1
the judge is investigating whether some of those funds were diverted for private use			2

he seeks to determine how much knowledge or participation the princess may have had in this company 's activities , according to the court order last tuesday			0
the preliminary charges eventually could be dropped , but a filing of indictments would set a trial in motion			2
@entity17 , an @entity102 medalist in handball , was granted the title of duke of @entity34 when he married @entity12 in 1997			2

but the royal household has said the @entity3 does not plan to abdicate			0
